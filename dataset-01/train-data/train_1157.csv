3,A good book with many examples; almost too many.,"This book is an excellent book for a communication's class. It presents many understandable and relatable examples. But its greatest fall back is the overwhelming amount of information, there is just too much to remember! Another weakness of the book is its lackluster in appearance; it is just an ugly book which can be a big turn off when you want to read it through."
4,A Nice Start,"The First volume can't really set the tone for the entire series, but it is a nice start. It ready reminds me of Record of Lodoss War in Space, a young man with a elf in space(Maybe that's why they also call it ""Elf in space"" ^_^)I enjoy it, I hope you do too"
4,Crest of the Stars,"Full of sence of wonder, an atmospheric sci-fi adventure in every detail. Specially its linguistic creation only can be compared with Quenja in ""the Lord of the Rings""."
1,Overhyped,"When this DVD was referred to me, I was curious...When I saw it, I saw nothing special, and at times, I saw nothing good...The story revolves around a story that's too common in anime, a plucky, yet somewhat lost hero, and his companion/love interest who is infinitely stronger, but very naive.The story takes forever to unfold, and when it finally does, you wonder if it was worth the trip. To add to it, the soundtrack is horribly out of place, fraught with woodwinds that would have been more applicable to a series with a more organic feel, or sci-fi of the 70's.On the whole, this is a series that is better skipped. There's much more promising titles out there that should have your hard earned money put towards."
5,Great scifi/fantasy,"This is a nice blend of western mythology and scifi. Genetically engineered space elves rule the universe with an iron fist and a beautiful, ever young face. Lovely animation, well developed characters - a great watch whether you are a Cowboy Bebop newbie or a die-hard Macross otaku."
5,"Beautiful, excellent space opera!","This is a very beautiful series, thought out to the smallest detail and elegantly depicted. It may move too slowly for some people, as it is based on a novel series and very much shows its roots. The art design is wonderful, from the ship designs to the characters, even the small details like a salute. My major complaint deals with the romanization of names--the novel series included a new language which is an alphabetic system, so a name could be directly spelled in roman characters. The translators chose to ignore this and used questionable romanizations of the names. This series shows great promise, though the first DVD left the viewers in a bit of a cliffhanger (possibly intentionally). If you can deal with a slower pace than most anime, this is a first-class story, very well realized. I eagerly await the next volume!"
3,"a kind of space opera, growing and understanding.","Based on a Japanese SF novel 'sekai-no-monsho' by Hiroyuki Morioka, this anime series focuses on the adventure and journey of Jinto and Lafiel.Jinto's father has sold out his home planet becuase of his ambition when the Humankind Empire Abh sieged the planet. Jinto is sent to serve Abh fleet for the degree of a nobility.Lafiel is a granddaughter of Emperor of the Humankind Empire Abh. The 'Abh' is not human in fact, they are descendant from humanoid enhanced by DNA operation for efficient action in space.When the war has broken up between Abh and other humans nations, Jinto and Lafiel escaped from the cruiser 'Basroile'. In their journey to escape from battlefield, understanding and reliance grows between two characters.scenes of fleet battle, some action scenes, little comedy. some tastes of shoujo SF anime also."
5,Great everyday teapot,"I collect teapots,so I have a number of them. However, for everyday tea brewing, Corelle is my choice. The teapots are both attractive and sturdy, and inexpensive enough that you need not worry about breakage. However, I have used one of another pattern for years, without damage. The Shadow Iris is a patricularly lovely pattern, whether for decorative purposes or everyday use."
3,Large,The pot is bigger than I thought it would be. It is ceramic but not the same material as corelle dishes. But it works. I put it in the microwave. No problem.
3,An Edward Gorey Zoo,"This book might have been a book from a small English town's zoo at the turn of the century, but now it has been misplaced to the 20th century. Delicious!"
5,AMAZING.,"This book will change lives. I bought several and gave away as gifts. Be careful you dont buy just the work book, or just the book, get the book first and then decide if you want a workbook. The workbook is good, but it gets pretty personal!"
5,Check the book!,"This is a great resource, however, newer copies of the book contain the workbook in the back, so you don't need to purchase this unless you want two copies of the workbook. So, make sure to check if the book already contains it to save yourself some money!"
4,A little long winded,"Overall the questions in this workbook are a good companion to the book. I am single, never married so some of the questions have no revelance in my life at the moment. Others are good because they make me think of my future and what I want and don't want from a husband. Some of the chapters are very long with a lot of questions to them. Great resource to do as part of a small group, which is how I am using it."
1,Writers Are Sexist And Against Free Speech,"Either I have gone completely blind or all the less thanperfect reviews are missing from this area of Amazon.comNot blaming this on Amazon because it's a great company whichhas helped many people.I am blaming this on writers who can'ttake a different opinion other than their narrow view of howmen and women behave.Anyway as I said before the book falls short in helping womenbecause it seems to dismiss any real sexuality in them beyondsterotypical attention and romance starved love junkies.If someone wants to help women,then know that all women arenot like the sterotype,some of us don't need a man for attention and have the same sexual temptation men face.skyraven101@excite.com"
4,This series continues to improve as the story gains depth,"I enjoyed this novel more than I did the first book in this series, and read it quite quickly. The story moves along at a brisk pace with a steady character development for all the main players in the story with no noticeable slow patches in the plot pacing.By ridding himself of the Drakhaon Gavril Nagarian appears to have gained personal freedom for himself. However, he has left his country fatally weakened to Prince Eugene's ambition. Gavril and those he loves will pay a price higher than he ever imagined for his freedom from his daemon and by the end of this novel the whole world will stand on the brink of disaster as old secrets and their promise of power become unravelled.I'm looking forward to book 3 of this series, which I assume is the final volume. It will be interesting to see how these storylines resolve as these characters grow on you as you are alternatively appreciative and appalled by their actions."
2,Fair Read,It was a OK book but I thought the army sizes could have been larger to be more believable for defending a realm.
4,Great!,"Some parts of the book are predictable, like I knew that Emily knew even when I was still on the 5th chapter. It's a sweet story with lots of comedy."
3,False pretenses.,"It was all right, not nearly as good as the rest of the ""Love Stories"" collection (for example ""Some Girls Do""(Number 11)). Jeff is attracted to Emily at first sight. Unfortunately, she thinks that he's Quinn, his rich womanizing roommate. Jeff knows that he is out of his league with Emily, and tries his best to suppress his feelings for her. There are some really boring parts in this book, but there are also some good parts which make the read worthwhile. Overall, it's a decent read. It won't keep you curled up in bed flipping page after page, though."
3,A quick read,"I read Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler, and enjoyed it far more than I enjoyed this book.It felt almost like a Mills & Boons type of story, but for young adults.It was nice though just to read about Jeff and Emily and not have the anticipated anxiety of what could happen, if this or that happened.The book is a quick read, and moved fast. Perhaps too fast, because I never really felt a romantic connection between Jeff and Emily. I was more interested in the relationship between Harper and Lonnie."
5,my favorite love story,"I thought that this was the best love story because it was by far the most humorous. it also shows how being decietful can get you into trouble. it was very realistic, and the perfect mix of comedy and heartbreak. the side romance was also very entertaining. the book covered a lot of time and places without seeming to rush. overall a wonderful tale."
3,"Old tech, but does the job","The Makita stick-type 9.6v batteries are a generation or two old now. In fact, they started the entire cordless power tool revolution. I still use my old Makita 9.6v drill because of it's light weight and great balance, something the 18V and larger NiCad and NiMH tools don't do!Build quality is decent, but not awe inspiring. Made in China like so many modern tools. Oddly enough I'm not seeing a big drop in prices of power tools as production moves from Japan and the US to China. Why is that?This flashlight is a decent addition to your vintage 9.6v collection, but I wouldn't buy it if starting from scratch today. Somebody needs to make a super high efficiency LED based light which would really make the most of these old batteries, but the market is probably too small for such a thing.At the right price for a retro-cordless tool user like myself this is a handy addition, but if you are starting from scratch go with a newer tech Li-Ion technology."
5,Five Star,"Great value, product and fast delivery. Item worked great right out of the package. Overall, I am very pleased and I highly recommend this seller. I will shop again when in need of products."
5,review for Makita flashlight,I had this product for years...loved it. That is why I wanted a second one. It is a bright light and easy to recharge.
4,Good accesory,"If you have the right batteries and a charger, this is a great flashlight. Someone stole my drill that used the same battery. I had 2 extra batteries and a charger. I wanted to upgrade the drill and to find good use for what I already had. This flashlight fit my needs to a ""T""."
2,Sad,"I am by no means an avid gamer--I've probably only completed 10 or so video games in my life so I'm no expert. In any case, I had tons of fun with games 1, 2, and 3. The combination of exploration with mini-challenges/quests was engaging and fun. I loved exploring and hunting for the bonuses and messing around with the prefects during night missions, but this game disappointed me. I was happy to have the exploration back after game 4, but there was no challenge whatsoever. The whole thing was insultingly easy and required no strategy. Everything could be beaten/completed on essentially the first try, which was a bit of a let down, honestly. Maybe it's because I was younger when I played the earlier games, but I like them much better because they actually had parts that required some thought/planning/stealth and retries. There's no triumph when you get past any given part of this game because a two year old could do it.Alas."
3,ok game,a lot of hype but the graphics are not that good. Very crisp but the design itself isn't good.
4,Good reference material for the DVD,"Michael Moore released this book to act as a back-up to his DVD Fahrenheit 9/11, so watch the DVD before reading the book.The book is the screenplay of the movie followed by articles on the Iraq War and the Bush Administration's handling of it. Needless to say that there are some good articles written here and Bush comes off as someone who has made some mistakes.Whether the facts presented in the book are true or not, it is still a worthwhile read."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This book is a useful but unnecessary appendix to the (excellent) film. The bulk of this book is taken up by the script of the film, something that I suspect few readers will have much use for. There are also several short articles and a collection of e-mails to Moore, both of which don't add much that can't be found at various websites. Perhaps the most (or only) useful feature is footnotes indicating the sources for most of the key claims in the film.Disappointing overall, and certainly lacking any of the compelling energy of the film, but useful if you really need to refer back to sources for the film's assertions."
4,farenheight 9/11,"Michael Moore is a man on a mission and has the incredble ability to open minds.Some of his views are debatable,however the majority make common sense and are worth pursuing.He has the ability to make very serious subjects concise and thought provoking.Highly recommended readKeith Bryan"
4,Makes me wonder...,"Why all the attnetion to Moore. Half this book is the list of sources used for the film and articles that cover similar topics. He'd not the only one critisising Bush and the republicans. If anything, he just almagamates what all the otherss say and puts his own humourous twist to it.The book itself is mostly great. A list of sources, letters commenting on the film. Articles about the film, and topics raised by it.It's all one sided to be sure, I wouldn't expect otherwise, but we're so overexpsed to the other side it's rather refreshing.I knock this down a star though as I thought transcribing the film was a waste of paper. I can watch the film, I do'nt need to read it. Other than that, I'd like to see campanion books like this for Moore's other films."
3,Scary Truth,This is more or less a bilography to where Michael Moore- got all the information for the movie- and it's scary that he tells us where he got his footage and the simple truths that made a national hit.No one now can claim that the movie is not based on facts which is why I assume Moore made the book. Read the book along with seeing the movie and you'll find yourself scared and petrified of what to expect next.
5,Great light,A lot of the people I work with use similar Makita lights so I got one too. It uses the same battery as my drill and still works after I've dropped it a couple times. Well illuminates hard to see areas.
4,Excellent Agatha Christie film,This movie is one of my all-time favorites. It has a wonderful cast and Peter Ustinov might not look like Christie's Poirot but he has beautiful delivery of the lines. Fun from beginning to end and easily watchable over and over again - there's always something new to notice. A very witty and entertaining film.
4,good,was hard to find in the stores- and the product was what they said and arrived in good time and in good shape
5,rating the movie Evil Under the Sun,Evil Under the Sunone of the best movies I have ever seen! Love Agatha Christie and ole Porter. The cast was 1st rate. Movies made today cannot touch this one.
5,Fun In The Sun,"One of world's best detectives investigates an odd assortment of characters at a posh resort set in the Adriatic. This is my go to movie for an evening of fun - the casting is awesome, the dialogue is witty - the setting is sublime. Get it or rent it - you will enjoy it."
1,Not able to be played in UK,American film which was not compatable with UK machinery. Therefore a wastw of time and money by allRegards David Jackson
4,FABULOUS!,"The best Christie adaptation I have ever seen! Maggie Smith and Diana Rigg are wicked and the humor is scathing! Very well written, beautifully filmed and excellently cast. And the music CD is now available, and definitely worth a listen!"
4,great watercolors,"I always enjor Agatha Christy stories, but this rendition of Hercule Periot was particularly good from the cast of characters were acted by excelent actors, the lovely watercolor pictures at the begining to the to the lovely scenic island pictires. The suspence held on until the very end. Diana Rigg's fashions were lovely."
3,Strong Finish,"Evil Under The Sun follows the case of a selfish English actress who is murdered at an exclusive island resort, surrounded (of course) by a number of people who will not mourn her death. Diana Rigg is the actress, and it's up to Hercule Poirot, played again by Peter Ustinov, to solve the seemingly impenetrable crime. I don't think his performance represents Poirot the way Christie probably envisioned him, but he is fun as the famous sleuth. The potential murderers are played by such recognizable stars as Maggie Smith, James Mason, Roddy McDowell, and Sylvia Miles. Most of the actors play it very broadly, often going for laughs, with Smith being the most successful at it. The film moves along quite slowly, really coming to life as Ustinov reveals all, solving the crime just as we knew he would. With its poor pacing and script-in-need-of-a-rewrite, this isn't a great mystery movie. But finding the solution will keep you interested, particularly with an ending that pays off."
2,Ustinov is no Poirot!,"I am a huge Agatha Christie fan, so this film was adisappointment for me. Overall the set-up and actors were okay, but Iwas very turned off by the performance of Peter Ustinov. Anyone who knows the character of Hercule Poirot knows that he wouldn't be caught dead hamming it up and spouting bad French the way Ustinov portrayed him! Christie's Poirot was extremely vain about his appearance and even dyed his hair! Ustinov takes away all the character's suave, quiet dignity and turns him into a bloated clown. This could have been an okay murder-whodunnit, but Ustinov really ruined it for me. David Suchet really IS Poirot, and it's a shame he wasn't discovered before this movie was filmed! END"
5,Evil Under the Sun a true delight!,"This film is one I have watched multiple times. It is a sheer delight. The setting is beautiful, the photography superb, the cast magnificent, and how can you top the music of Cole Porter. This blend of cast (especially Peter Ustinov as Poirot), music and scenery is unbeatable. I highly recommend ""Evil"" as a viewing of great enjoyment."
5,"Possibly, the Best Mystery Movie Ever!","I can think of only a few movies that combine this much drama, suspense, comedy, superb acting, and images with such phenomenal results! Ustinov is over the top in his role as the famous Belgian detective! Not only does he show his sharpness and intelligence, but he also shows his comical and witty side well. The solution to the mystery is well hidden and concealed, but YET there are subtle things that an intelligent observer can catch on to. I do not want to ruin the solution for those of you who have not seen it. But I will say that almost never before, have I seen such a well developed and diverse group of suspects. This is not a typical dark and scarey mystery, but that in no way whatsoever hampers this phenomenal masterpiece!"
4,Great film. A must see!,This is a great film! Glamorous setting. Great cast. Interesting storyline. A must see! One of my favorites.
5,Christie Fan,"Great acting, beautiful scenery and vintage Agatha Christie story line! What more could you want."
4,Delicious camp!,"How often do you see the two brilliant stars, Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith, go eyeball to eyeball? Jousting, jabbing, dissing, undermining... it's all too delightful! And Roddy McDowall at his campy best. And Jane Birkin's sudden metamorphosis from plain jane into dazzling beauty. And Peter Ustinov hamming it up as only Peter Ustinov can. Get yourself a cocktail or a glass of wine (or two), sit down, put your feet up, and enjoy! By the way, the audio and video quality of this film on DVD is much better than on VHS."
4,Great mystery!,"This video will definitely keep you hanging on everyword. A great whodunit! Try and figure out who killed the famous Mrs. Marshall at the beautiful beach resort. If you love a good murder mystery, this one's for you!"
5,hot millions,"well acted, good plot, good locations, worth watching with a loved one.price was a little expensive but overall worth it."
4,A little evil is a good thing,A quality item with vivid colors for a colorful location. Sets are excellently designed an built. Good performances and the solution to the crime could not be anticipate. Excellent.
3,Great organist but not a great compilation,Peter Hurford is a great organist but this compilation seems to be a bit dispersive and scrappy. In my opinion a better and more organic anthology isRomantic Organ Works(Decca 028946674222). I hope that Decca would release soon one or two box sets containing all the recordings of Hurford (unfortunately his Bach organ works are out-of-print too).
5,kitties love them,"kitties love these, and grown cats as well! they just chase these silly little balls all over the house, and even pick them up in their mouths like a dog would and carry them to me to throw them. silly kitties!"
1,noisy and nobody likes them,i have an older cat and a kitten and they don't like this toy at all. my older cat is picky but my kitten likes about anything so it this toy must be junk if he doesnt like it all. it's made of plastic and very hard so you can only roll them and they have little plastic balls in them that make a very loud annoying sound whenever they roll. i would avoid this toy unless you already have experience with this toy.
2,Not so much,"My cat loves to chase and swat toys around the house. Her curiosity with theses shimmer balls is limited to watching me try to entice her to play with them. Durable, pretty, pricey, and not for my cat."
5,Great,Love these sparkley jingle balls! Kitties are happy they are great for our marble floors. The babies could play for hours. Love thst they came with 4 some things only have 2 packs. Came on time along with my other orders. Kitties are super happy would def buy more.
3,Allergy warning,"Great product. However,beware if you have food allergies. These products are made in a facility with other foods so they can be contaminated and you can have an allergic reaction (like I did). Allergy sufferers beware!!"
5,Nature Path Organic Corn Flakes,"I am 100 pct pleased with my purchase of Nature's Path Organic Corn Flakes. I need to use products containing no added sugar and does not contain other unhealthy ingredients. This product contains organic concentrated grape juice and a little sea salt. It is great for my diabetes because it does not have high carbs.Thanks Nature's Path for producing such a great product and making it available on Amazon.com.Paul RowellSautee Nacoochee, GANature's Path Organic Corn Flakes Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Eco Pac Bags (Pack of 6)"
3,Not as good as the first series,"We owe all the volumes of the first series and my daughters and I LOVE them. I was so excited to see there were three new DVD's available. However, I was a little disappointed. A lot of the signs have already been covered in previous volumes and there are not as many songs. They use the same song throughout the DVD. I also don't like the alphabet/math segments. If I want my kids to learn math and their ABC's, I will get them DVD's that teach that. I want my kids to learn more signs...I am still a big fan of Signing Time; it has done wonders for my kids, but the second series could have been better..."
5,Excellent resource for parents of young children,"Not only is this good for the growing trend of signing with your baby, but it keeps older children entertained and instructed, too. Love it!!"
3,good support unless you're really sweating,"This wrap provides excellent support for a tender hamstring. I especially liked the compression pad. I was, however, a bit disappointed in how poorly the wrap stayed in place when I was running. As I perspired, the wrap would slip significantly. I had to stop several times in the middle of a race to rewrap it."
5,Durable and effective,"Very durable for high impact sports....easy to use, reasonably comfortable without too much slippage. Definitely helped speed up the healing process."
2,Slides when using during sport activity,"I had the same problem than other reviewers: the strap slides when sweating, that is when you need it the most.During normal activity it offers good support but for this price I expected full use."
4,Very good wrap!,"I purchased this product because I have a burning sensation on my hamstring when I sit down (possible Piriformis). It has a small cushion pad that you can position on the back of your hamstring and then strap it in place. I have to say that it has really helped me with my pain/discomfort. Now I just have to start doing exercises and stretching that will help me heal from this condition.I highly recommend this product. The only reason I gave it a four star, is because it is not as wide as I would have liked it to have been. Cure"
2,so-so,I thought that i would try this product out. It's no better than one I bought for half the price.
5,Perfect Hamstring support,Best feature is that it is adjustable and will allow you to adjust pressure where it matters the most. I didn't experience it sliding as a result of sweating. Highly recommend.
3,Good if you legs are small,"I injuried my hamstring 2 years ago and keep re-injurying it, since then I've had to play sports more carefully and less often which bothers me. So I thought instead of wrapping it with a normal sports wrap I'd order a compression wrap. The problem I'm having is that all the compression is down towards the bottom of my leg (towards my knee) when I pull the straps completly tight. I need all the compression to be as high as possible because I am lacking support all the way down the back of my leg (It feels as if I have no hamstring at all). I only ordered it because of the good reviews it got, I just dont know if my thighs are too big or not. My legs are 26 inches around so I'm not sure if that is too big or not. I gave this product 3 stars because I didnt want to ruin the reputation of it if I only had this problem."
3,slides down,"it provides support and some gentle pressure but when you become really active and sweat a lot it starts sliding down. Also when you need the pressure pad inside of your tigh, the parts that closes the wrap scatches at the inside of your led which i somehow annoying."
3,Ham String Pull,It works really good as long as the leg doesn't sweat. Then it tends to slip. I was constantly pulling it back up while playing tennis. But is does work.
3,hamstring wrap,"this wrap has helped alleviate hamstring pain while playing tennis. i only wear it for that purpose. it is made from neoprene and therefore makes the area it covers very hot and sweaty. i like the adjusting straps, but they do not stop the wrap from sliding when wet from perspiration."
1,Should have warned of shipment delay BEFORE order was placed,I placed this order May 31 and it just shipped today June 6. When I placed the order there was no indication there would be such a delay. I would have ordered from somewhere else. My hamstring will be healed by the time this thing arrives. Not too happy about the delayed shipment.
4,hamstring compression wrap,I had a hamstring pull while working in the yard. I purchased this item and used it for three weeks with excellent recovery of my injury. Allowed me to work at the office and exercise at the gym till I recovered. Would recommend this product to anyone with a sports injury.
4,CompWrap,"This compression wrap is very functional, durable and comfortable. I purchased the product and it was shipped very quickly, arrived as advertised and has so far withstood all of the wear and tear of my soccer games. I would highly recommend this product."
5,Doesn't get any better than this!!!,"OK, I'm a bit prejudiced because my former hometown band (as Rachel Barton calls it) is the CSO and I have some personal connections to it. But this recording is certainly up there with all the others--you can't go wrong."
1,Low quality item,"I received this pen for Christmas (a week ago) and it is already broken. The actual flash drive has only been used once and is still functioning, but the pen part broke before I used the drive the first time. It is made of cheap plastic and has cracked up the side near the pocket clip. Now the whole top of the pen falls off exposing the electronics of the flash drive.This item is a neat idea, but I would wait and puchase one made of better materials. This may be why PNY doesn't make them anymore."
3,Film quality could use some work,"I'm a John Wayne freak and love all of his movies. I purchased this one for my collection but found it to be of poor quality. I had hoped it had been enhanced a bit, but it had not. You have to really be a John Wayne fan to sit through this one."
5,John Wayne. Lives in film thank the good Lord!,This is an old serial from my youth. It was ground braking then and is very watchable today.Somehow age seems unimportant when you watch this compilation of short films made into one full length movie. The seamless film editing is truly well done. If you didn't know before hand you would never guess it.This is a new release not something that has been on every bunch of multi-film release packages and renamed several time like so many others.If your a John Wayne fan its a must have.
4,Desert Command,"This is a movie re-release of a movie serial, Three Mesquiteers, from Nat Levine's pre-Republic studios from about 1934. As with all serial re-releases, all cliff hangers were eliminated, making this film a bit difficult to follow. It is a fun serial to watch. This 'movie' may have some worth, however, watching Wayne trying to emote. He's even more woooden than usual."
1,ITS PURPOSE DIED IN ITS SERIAL FORMAT.,"Released in 1946, this feature is cobbled together from a 12 part 1933 Mascot serial, THE THREE MUSKETEERS, and purports to be based upon the classic work by Dumas, with the action transferred to the Sahara and involving a struggle of the French Foreign Legion opposite a secret group of Arab villains, with John Wayne's character mentioned in the script as D'Artagnan to a trio of guardsmen. The original serial is grotesquely silly, and this synthesis is, if possible, even worse, with situations and dialogue that are numbingly puerile; however, if the film lacks any direction whatsoever, the viewer cannot fail but be amazed at the athletic equestrian stuntwork of Yakima Canutt and his crew of worthies, actively and dramatically superior as they are to the remainder of the performers."
2,Not much here in my opinion,"Moose Peterson recycles information he's written for magazine articles into this book about wildlife photography. Some of the pictures in his book are good, others are just ordinary.The worst thing about this book is the poor grammar and spelling. Doesn't this guy have an editor?I was really hoping for more from someone who is supposed to be a world famous wildlife photographer.There is some information on digital here so I gave it two stars."
3,Good for beginners,"The NTC dictionary is a good resource for beginning students of the Japanese language. Characters are found via a stroke-count lookup system that is (usually) pretty intuitive. Character entries are quite detailed, as well - character variants and handwritten forms are included, along with numerous definitions and usage notes.Eventually, though, the NTC dictionary will be outstripped by advanced users. Defined characters are half that of other dictionaries (approx. 3000 - compared to the 7000+ of the Nelson's), and the lookup system has no relation to that found in a (Japanese) Japanese character dictionary (i.e., once you advance to the level of using Japanese-language character dictionaries, you will have to re-learn the lookup system - something you won't have to do if you use Nelson's or similar dictionaries).Until the student reaches the advanced level, however, this is a good, informative and intuitive resource."
5,Photograpic view of the social life along old 66,"This books contains all that is needed to make the reader -or viewer- want to travel the road, even just by looking at the pictures. It isn't called a photographic essay for nothing. The text is more social oriented and is probably one way to look at the 20th century and its cultural heritage along Historic Route 66. Those readers going travel old 66 might be a little bit disappointed that it does not give many clues to find the locations easily. This is a book about an icon on its own terms.A must in your library if you're interested in Route 66."
3,Too much of a good thing?,"Although it's a good value for the money, 2 discs may be a little too much Kinks-styled crunch to bite off. I mean come on, their cover of ""Louie Louie"" is darn near definitive, but do we really need 3 versions of it? Folks, Thee Headcoats are one of the greatest garage bands ever, but it's not easy wading through the same 3 chords over and over for 50 songs. This is the type of band better heard in a brief 30 minute blast of energy. Headcoats fans will eat this album up, but for a newcomer I recommend Heaven To Murgatroyd It's Thee Headcoats Already on Sub Pop (which has their greatest song, ""Mantrap"")."
1,poor condition upon arrival,"Good product but it is not one that should be sold by Amazon. Original packaging (box around breakable plates) was stuffed into a shipping box with minimal additional padding. First box, five of sixteen items arrived broken...second box, 3 of sixteen arrived broken with even worse packaging...Amazon is lucky it even made it...have returned it asking for refund...good product made bad by God awful packing, God awful shipping, God awful service. Amazon failed miserably on this one."
5,Read it with your child,"This compendium of brief biographies of notable figures from history has been written to facilitate joint reading by parent and child. The stories are inspiring, and are rendered in a style that is engaging and accessible to both old and young. The author is a retired educator. I have seen her in action with my own child, and have admired her. The book is equally impressive."
5,a wonderful place to be for awhile . . .,"wandering through her mind. she captures a place, a feeling, a silence or a torture and articulates excellently so you feel you are there, too. i await more from her!"
4,Touching and Heart Felt,"I just finished ""When I was Puerto Rican."" I thoroughly enjoyed the book and connected with the author. Being the oldest female child in my family, I have felt the way that she did. The book takes you back through your adolescence and makes you exam life.Another plus to the book is how much culture it has. I enjoyed learning about the culture, the food, the dichos (sayings). I am pretty familiar with the Mexican Culture but the Puerto Rican has a completely different vibe and I enjoy it. Esmeralda's experience in New York is what so many people dream of. She makes me proud of her and I feel that I know her so intimately. That is what I love about her writing. Thank you for being so honest with your readers."
4,A Pleasure to Read a Book by a Fellow Puerto Rican,"As a Puerto Rican female, I related to many of Santiago's experiences. Her poetic style of writing made her story a pleasure to read. I initially chose to read this book to fulfill an assignment for my Ethnic Studies class. I enjoyed it so much, however, that I am now an Esmeralda Santiago fan and plan to read all of her other books."
4,When I Was Puerto Rican Review,This is the autobiography of Esmeralda Santiago growing up in the country side of Puerto Rico. She describes the life she lives in P.R. and how it all changes as she becomes a senorita. It shows the culture and customs she learns as she grows older. She uses Spanish sayings to relate to each chapter throughout the book.Personally I thought the book was great. I really related to how she grew up because I myself am Puerto Rican and like her I am one of many brothers and sisters in a family. I also enjoyed the way she describes P.R. because I've never been there but by reading this book I can visualize the way it must be. This book is not only good for Hispanics but for all cultures.
2,Very little material for book club discussions,"I expect the prime reason this autobiography was published is because it's unique. However, it's only half a story - assume this is contrived in the hope of selling the other half at a later date. The author's reconstruction of dialogue is to be admired, as well as the descriptions of her life of poverty and deprivation. More to be admired is the character of her mother who managed to produce and provide for eleven children in an unmarried state, while coping with an irresponsible father. Can only recommend if you're looking for a holiday read. Very little material for book club discussions."
1,A very considerate amount of trash!,"For all of you trash lovers, this is an exquisite treasure of idiocy. Esmeralda Santiago is one of the recent idiots that have succeded in contemporary publishing due to being a ""minority."" I had to read this novel for a class; otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it. It starts OK. The narrator speaks of her childhood in childish, but cute tones. The first three chapters are not that bad, if you like anthropological literature, inside of which one sees the customs of an ""exotic"", or ""minor"", land. But after chapter four, one starts to get attacked by the most horrible cliches in fashion. The stupid narrator discovers her sexuality; discovers the hate for her father; discovers life; discovers Harvard. If you like Latin American lit, and are tired of Garcia Marquez, try Reverend Borges, Cabrera Infante or Onetti. If you're into women lit, try Poniatowska. If you like the Kinky Kincaid sort of lit, well, read more of Santiago, and good luck in your dumb readings."
2,When I was Puerto Rican,"In my English class we have read this book that is called ""When I was Puerto Rican."" I think this book is not interesting. But that would be my opinion. What I think this book is about is how they move from a little pueblo called ""Macon"" into New York City. They didn't like where they move. And there dad was a little player and the mother of course you know how some women are they take their men back cause they feel that they can't find anyone else, so she kept taking him back. The mother had 7 kids with this guy, but there was no prblem about how many kids they had.But if you enjoy a book that has something to to with someone's life style you may be the person t enjoy this book."
5,Outstanding!!!,"If you are Puerto Rican, you have to read it. If you are not Puerto Rican you will have a great narrative on how life was in the island and the perspective in which is perceive, a nostalgic feeling, after having been apart from the island for such a long time."
3,"Warm , funny interesting read with a disapintingly abrupt ending","Even though I was born 1950 Indiana, I found Ms Santiago's novel to be very interesting. My parents were born in Puerto Rico, and married there. They moved to Indiana for work. I was the first child. We lived in a Polish neighborhood, and had no immediate family. the novel helped me to have a better idea of their early lives. While our lives were much more stable and free of strife I enjoyed reading about the relationships and strong family ties. I feel that the ending was very rushed and left a lot of questions. thanks, Tita"
4,Interesting,"As a Puerto Rican, it was interesting to learn about life in Puerto Rico before I was born."
5,"memoir's don't get any better than this, perfecto!","ok,I'll tell you something,I am Pureto Rican,and this book has nothing in common with me.But,man! did I like this book.I mean,the story is sad and all but the writing was beautiful.I actually felt the people in the book.The author has a great sence of what the reader wants.And that is great discription.So hey ,if you are looking for an in you're face tour de force about immigration then this memoir is for you."
1,If i could give it 0 stars I would,"This book was horrible! Santiago exoticizes Puerto Rican culture. The proper way to eat a guayaba? Gimme a break! And the ending of the book is pathetic: she gets into Harvard and therefore is successful. Nothing else needs to be said. Oh please. As a Puerto Rican who went to an Ivy League school there is more to life that getting a diploma from a prestigious school and it certainly is no guarantee of success. Santiago is clearly capitalizing on the current thirst for 'ethnic' books in this country (just look at the title). For EXCELLENT writing and a more realistic view of life on the island I recommend Ana Lydia Vega, Magali Garcia Ramis, Rosario Ferre, Edgardo Rodriguez-Julia, Luis Rafael Sanchez."
4,Good Services,It was a good service the vendor was outstanding and always did what he had to do at the right time.
5,Coming of age autobiography of a Puerto Rican/American girl,"Full of imagery, eloquently Latin and inspirational. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a good ethnic read. END"
3,Landson's Review for When I was Puerto Rican,"When I was Puerto Rican is a coming of age memoir of a young girl growing up in rural Puerto Rico. The author, Esmeralda Santiago, describes with vivid detail not only the surroundings of her small village and the nature around her, but also her emotions. The novel records with extraordinary detail the way the author felt as she experienced tough times within her family life, school life, going through puberty, and relating to the society around her both in Puerto Rico, and in Brooklyn. When I was Puerto Rican expertly paints an image of a young girl dealing with strife as she grows into a woman while making the transition to a totally different life in America. I don't particularly recommend the novel, but it was an interesting read, although sad."
4,A passionating story,"The life of the young Esmeralda Santiago is interesting, well-written and full of colored details."
1,Oh please...,"I had to read this book for a class in college back when it was still fairly ""new"". I say ""new"" because it is the same tired formula of most contemporary Latin American authors.I currently, previously and, as far as I can tell, will continue to BE Puerto Rican and the ""charms"" of this story fail to grab me.Reading some of the glowing reviews for this book, I suspect I was never meant to be it's target audience."
5,Amazing!Esmeralda holds NOTHING back!You wont put it down!,"This book is like a sneak peak into the hearts and lives of Puerto Rican migrants. Esmeralda Santiago writes in a way that makes you feel what she feels. She puts you in her shoes and takes you through her journey from Puerto Rico to the United States, as well as from her childhood to adolesence. Many people migrate to the United States searching for a better life without poverty. Unfortunately, in many cases these people are greeted with low paying jobs and discrimination. The effects of migration are different for everybody. The increasing number of immigrants coming to this country makes it necessary to educate yourself about different cultures. This seems to be the only way to break down the walls of misconception between people of different backrounds. Read this book and LEARN about the migration experience of a poor, Puerto Rican family in search of a better future. Beautifully written! Colofully detailed! Shockingly honest!"
5,Signed Annemarie's Personal Cook Book,"An absolutely excellent cook book. Old, and forgotten, but the recipes really work and they are delicious. I love the recipe for red cabbage, I always cook it for Thanksgiving."
3,Nice but...,It's the first campaign setting ever wich not includes how to make characters. This implies buying the dm screen/dm companion in order to get those... Frankly speaking: I'ts a nice book but if they want my money why just donk ask for it whit a gun??
2,Only Caesar III worthy of playing,"Truth be told, Caesar III is really the only good game in this collection. The other ones were not created by the same people who made Caesar III (David Lester already sold the company); as such, they are painfully of less quality. Pharaoh has a certain level (non-warfare) that doesn't let you pass when you fulfill all mandatory requirements. So it's a dud... impossible to finish.Caesar III is really a masterpiece, however, there is a certain ""building limit"" which unables you to build really big cities.Did I forget Caesar IV? It's not even worth mentioning."
3,A Good Game!,I thought it was a good game to play. I enjoyed the graphics but gameplay overall was a bit sketchy. I felt at times as if the game was taking control of me. But once I got the hang of it this game really gave new meaning to addictive. I almost had to throw the game away to stop playing! This game overall is a great game to play and i enjoyed it.
2,Disappointed,I found this book to be a complete disappointment. It was a surface discussion that never got into the variety of plants available for selection or suggestions for an appropriate method of determining the site location of plants for the central Florida area.The publicity blurb on its description on Amazon promised much more.
5,Gardening and Landscaping in Central Florida by Marlys Bell,"All my Master Gardener friends agree with me that this is the book we had been waiting for! If we had had this wonderful, user friendly volume when we first came to this area, we would have saved ourselves from committing many costly and time consuming mistakes. We love to recommend it to frustrated newcomers seeking the ultimate guide."
2,Not what I was looking for . . . . .,"I'm a Christian, but found this book too religiously pushy and lacking in the info I needed to help a troubled teen who is longing for an absent father. It had some good info, but I found the idea of telling a teen that God was the only Father she needed, to be of little help. Yes, we all need God, and especially when faced with life's hardships, but her longing for her father isn't going to be satisfied with that knowledge alone. If a girl has never had a father in her life, it's certainly difficult for her to envision a heavenly Father in the same concept that I do because I was blessed with a wonderful earthly father. I didn't finish it, and read Longing for Dad: Father Loss and It's Impact which had much better info on the subject."
1,Too Religious,"If you're not deeply Christian, this book is not for you. The author ought to make that clear so that the rest of us don't waste our money. If you don't believe in God and SATAN, if you want to take control of your own life instead of leaving it up to a ""higher power,"" this is not the book for you. In fact, if you take out the religious parts, there's almost no substance to this book. Not at all helpful."
3,Not MUM!!,"This is not the icelandic quartet that brought you ""Yesterday Was Dramatic- Today is ok""This is just an ok blues album"
3,"Not what you expected, but maybe thats not a bad thing","I bought this CD expecting the icelandic quartet, silly me. While this album did not immediately blow me away in the manner that the real Mum's ""Finally We Are No One"" did it has grown on me. Its basically some heavily electronic inspired blues/funk. Not bad music at all really. If the amazon rating scale was more flexible i'd give it a 3.5 star rating but i guess rounding down is the safe thing to do."
5,Excellent!,"Jean-Paul Vest is a seriously underrated musical prodigy, an uncanny mixture of intelligent lyrics and gorgeous guitar playing. Over the years he's been shocking audiences with great music in disappearing or just plain gone LES and East Village standards like Brownie's, Nightingale's, CB's. (remember when Manhattan used to mean something? Now its all Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn). Now he's back, with a new band.Don't know Jean-Paul? Where have you been? At times you'd think he's Johnny Marr possessed by the spirit of Hank Williams Sr. Last Charge is his new band with solid drums and bass performers (backup vocals reminds one of David Bowie's great Man Who Sold the World). Getaway Car is their first album, a terrific gem with awesome standouts that you can't get out of your head- Cartwheeling, Miracle, Now You Know, The King is Dead. An old classic is back- Circles. Mouthwatering guitarwork. Get it and you'll have it in your CD player for weeks."
1,Don't be fooled...............,"I will never pay anything more than a dollar for this movie....i am an avid collector,and the dvd transfer is horrid...........even for collectors....don't waste your time on this one......."
1,Poor Video Quality,"This looks like it was made from an old VHS, very poor video quality. If I could have given it zero stars I would have."
2,Inaccessible,"I've used this book in class, together withA New Arabic Grammar of the Written Languageby Haywood & Nahmad as a reference. I've finished the book.Schulz does contain a lot of information, and you can go along way with it. But it's not very pedagogical, and even with a teacher to explain things, I did not find it satisfying. Haywood & Nahmad, even tough it is much older, is easier to read and does explain the arabic language in a way Schulz does not. I have the feeling Schulz states facts to be memorized rather than explain the working of the language.I dare say I have a good understanding of grammar in general, but despite this some parts in Schulz where very hard to understand, even though the subjects weren't difficult.And the key to the exercises is ridiculously bad.I don't know the other books out there, but if you're going to use Schulz, I suggest you get an additional grammar-book. It'll make things much easier."
2,"Try, Try Again","This author shows promise. Some of her scenes were well-written and the relationship between the two main characters was thoroughly explored. However, the conversations were absolutely wooden as written, the characters behaved in anachronistic fashion, and the title character's name is *consistently misused* which distracted and frustrated me so much that I couldn't enjoy what there was of the storyline. Whatever happened to copyeditors, anyway? Ms. Solomon, I beg of you, do a little fundamental research! As written, the hero's family name was Sinclair, but his title was something else entirely. Therefore, the title of this book should be, ""Seducing Lord Something-Else-Entirely."" If you are looking for good traditional Regency romance, I recommend Emma Lange, Marion Chesney, or the always stellar Patricia Veryan, but I'd skip this one."
1,"Sorry, Not My Cup of Tea","I didn't like this book much at all; it is divided into three on-going romances at the same time, which is fine in itself, however I found the secondary characters were much more interestng than the primary characters.The premise of the story was good, which is that Lord Sinclair marries his wife in order for her to avoid a miserable marriage to his skinflint, elderly cousin, which also saves Lord Sinclair's inheritance. In the meantime, Lord Sinclair's best friend and his sister are falling in love, and Lord Sinclair's mother is holding off on a second marriage, wanting first to see her children happily married. The parts of the book in which the Sinclair family thwart Marianne's family (the new Lady Sinclair) in their machinations ruin her were interesting and amusing.Other than that, I didn't see a lot of redeeming qualities in this story."
4,Good but not so much for Theta sellers,"The other reviews point out the highlights of this book. I do think this is a worthwhile addition to any intermediate option trader, but I have to say if you are a net option seller there is little direct reference to your strategies. Still lots you can take from it, but not so much directly to your strategies. If you want to learn what to do when the call spread you sold is being threatened, you are not going to get a lot directly related to this. That being the case, buy and learn from it anyways as you will pick up or remember stuff that will make you a better trader."
2,Paint Cracked,"I applied this paint over magnetic paint and followed all directions on the box precisely. From the beginning it was difficult to remove writing without using a dry erase board cleaning solution. This was bearable. However, after two months of being on the wall the paint has cracked and chipped over about 50% of the surface that I covered (not in one particular area, it is scattered throughout)."
1,Terrible product,"I followed the directions to the letter on the package. I spent a lot of time prepping, priming, sanding, and then used all the write rollers and waited the appropriate time between coats and the appropriate time to let it dry. My first dry erase writing on the board is now a permanant part of the wall. I now have an expensive, white painted section of wall in my office which will soon have a dry erase board covering it up as I did what I should have in the first place and bought a real board. Don't waste your time with this product unless you have very low standards."
1,Rather just get a proper whiteboard,Painted multiple coats - wrote on it for the first time and did not come off until I took a brush to scrub it ... very disappointed. Have seen places where this works - suspect it's another product.
2,Works well for a week,This product worked well for the first week of use then it slowly started to get harder and harder to erase.
1,Rustoleum's Dry-Erase Paint is worthless!,"Bought this product the other day, and followed the directions completely: used the correct roller, put multiple coats on and let dry between each coat...but the results were terrible. IT DOES NOT WORK. The product does not wipe off at ALL.....had to use window cleaner and you can still see evidence of the dry-erase marker. What a waste of time, money and effort, and would not recommend this to anyone. Just spend the extra money for a Whiteboard. Now we have to re-paint our walls back to the original colour."
1,Horribly Disappointed,I bought this paint after reading glowing reviews and applied it to a table we wanted to redo. We sanded down the table top and primed its surface. I left it alone for several days before applying the Rustoleum whiteboard paint. We managed to get four thin coats of paint on the table before our 2 hour window was gone. All seemed to have gone well. We waited a whole week before trying the paint just to make sure it cured. I let my kids doodle on the table and then we attempted to erase it.It didn't come off. A wet paper towel worked but not well. We tried cleaners too and they'd remove the markers for awhile but eventually they too quit working. Now I have this ugly cracked and yellowed table that we keep a table cloth over while we attempt to sand it down. Attempt being the keyword here because it's very very difficult to remove and the sanding is slow going even with an electric sander.To say we're disappointed with this product would be an understatement.
3,Does NOT work with Magnetic Primer paint,"Our goal was to make a HUGE dry-erase marker board. We applied 4 coats of dry erase maker board paint on top of 4 coats of Magnetic Primer on a 10ft wide by 8ft tall wall. Flat thin printable magnets (like business cards) worked well.We used it for 2 months. Some of the colors (red and black) bonded with the board and were very hard to erase.After 90 days the Dry Erase Marker Board paint started to turn yellow ""ish"" and any marker colors were hard to erase after 1 day.A call to Rust-O-Leum customer service lead us to their engineering dept, and they stated that the chemical make-up of the 2 paints were not compatible and can not be used together.We now have a 4ft x 8ft Dry Erase board screwed to the wall."
2,Needs improvement,"The reason for two stars is for its poor eraseability. Having waited the time suggested on the box and longer, the markers don't erase well at all. The surface is very nice, and the paint when dried definitely looks like a whiteboard. But the markers smear so bad when erased that I can't give this product a good review."
1,save your money...,"If you want a dry erase board, you are better off buying a real dry erase board. I followed all directions to a T. The paint wasn't old, the wall was perfectly prepped, I put 3-4 coats on the board, I waited a full 7 days before making any marks on it, I used the low-odor dry erase markers, I wiped with a wet rag, I wiped with a dry rag, I went out and bought the expo dry erase spray... bottom line, you can still clearly and plainly see exactly what was written the very first time it was used. We are not talking about ""ghosting"" or even just marks, I'm talking... you can see EXACTLY what was written and where it was written after several attempts to wipe it off. Really angry I ruined my wall for this stuff... should have just bought a real board. I do have a email in to their customer service that hasn't been responded to yet, so we will see how that goes."
1,"one time use, now the wall is a mess","As with many of the reviews, i followed the directions and now have a white section in the kids room with many different colors of marker that will not wipe off. Dont do it!"
1,Poor Usability,Followed the instructions perfectly. Allowed 3 coats to dry for 2 days. Unable to wipe clean. Trying different products now to clean. Will update if I find something.
3,"Works well, but need to care for it.","This product is very reasonably priced, and applied well with a foam roller. I found that none of my dry-erase markers would fully erase (neither using a whiteboard eraser, nor a cloth). All marks can be completely erased with a bit of isopropyl alcohol on an old facecloth. The alcohol does not seem to harm the surface."
1,Teachers: Do NOT Use,"I cleaned, primed, and then painted the Rustoleum dry erase paint on my old chalkboard. I used the recommended high density brushes. I was careful about letting everything dry and sanding my surface down to make it perfectly smooth. I also was able to apply several coats of the paint and waited 3 days before writing on the wall.I wrote on the board for the first time today and guess what...it DOESN'T DRY ERASE...THE MARKER DOESN'T COME OFF.""Ghosting"" isn't even accurate, because writing is still as plain as day when you erase.I used a brand new EXPO marker, so I know it isn't a marker issue. I am a teacher, and I was planning on using the paint this year as an alternate to buying a yearly glossy showerboard. Now I'm out of $40, and I am frustrated that school starts TOMORROW and I currently have NOTHING to write on.I feel very jaded when it comes to ""specialty teacher items"" now. :("
3,Disappointed,"It works...but after 6 coats. We followed all the instructions step by step down to every detail(primer, foam rollers, etc). We were able to get 3 coats out of one can on the size wall we covered. After that, we wrote on the wall and after erasing, you could still clearly see what had been written. We tried different markers and they all erased poorly. The next weekend, we put another 3 coats up on the wall and it seems to be erasing okay now. We bought Mr. Clean magic erasers and they work great. I'm glad I didn't give up after the 3 coats, but don't let this product fool you into thinking it is as simple as putting 2 coats up on the wall. It's not!"
1,Does NOT work as promised! Don't do it!,"We bought this product with the intention of providing my 5 year old with a surface she could draw and write on. At the same time we also bought the chalkboard paint. We painted each of her 2 closet doors, one with dry erase paint and one with chalkboard paint and what a difference! I followed the directions exactly and the end results couldn't be any more different. The dry erase surface is everything but erasable! We are extremely disappointed with the results. Save some time and $$ and either use the chalkboard paint or buy a REAL dry erase surface. I have sent the company an email to see what they have to say. Has anyone else done the same? If so, what was their response? I hate it when companies make false claims and mislead customers."
2,Save some $$ and buy a pre-made dry erase board,I read the other reviews and decided to give this product a chance...It was a waste of my time. I wanted to rehab an old dry erase board that had become scratched over the years (but it's huge and has a solid oak frame and tray). I spent hours priming and sanding until my surface was smooth as glass. Then I applied the dry erase paint according to the directions. I thought things were going well until I checked on the board the following morning...the paint cracked! Now I'm back to square one!
1,Disappointing,"I bought this for use in my classroom. I had an old whiteboard that would no longer erase. I painted it with this product, following all of the instructions, waited and....... it didn't work. Could not erase anything written on the board. Great idea but it doesn't appear to work. Very messy to work with and takes forever to dry.Guess I will have to look to alternatives like ideapaint....."
1,TEACHERS BUY A DRY ERASE BOARD FROM LOWES'S,"I had the same exact experience as Valerie Ferell. I was so very excited about the product, followed the directions exactly and now I have no dry erase board to use on Monday. While the boards now look like a dry erase board, there is no ""erase"" in this product. It may be good in homes but it is ""HORRIBLE"" in the classroom. I bought two kits, paint tray roller, sand paper totaling $53.00 and about six hours of my time wasted. Now on the day before my students start school I have to buy boards, liquid nail and spend time putting boards up. My time and money were WASTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Shockingly horrible,"This product could not be more awful. You have to use it all at once so you can't test a small area. You just have faith it will actually work and follow the instructions painting the desired area. I lightly wrote ""hello"" after it dried for 24 hours and had to SAND it off because not even bleach would remove it. I think this paint makes it harder to get dry erase off of your wall. Do not buy. This should be considered false advertising."
4,Good Stuff - Nicely added Torque and Horsepower,"Installs easily, with great instructions. You'll be surprised at the bulk amount of stock junk you remove to install this product, probably lightens the vehicle a few pounds. (not enough to notice)Has improved my highway mpg by about 1.5 mpg, not bad, nice side effect of a performance product.I really notice that the FJ does not kick down a gear nearly as often as it used to on hills with the cruise control engaged.Really makes a nice roar at wide open throttle, but still sounds stock under normal driving conditions. Makes a fair difference in performance from idle to wide open throttle.Highly recommend this purchase, and from Amazon, good price, very rapid free delivery...I would give this 5 stars except I do not like the way the Mass Airflow Sensor is mounted, be careful not to lose the 2 very tiny black spacer washers.....Rock on!"
4,So Cute!,This is so cute and REALLY well made. It's just big enough so my son can carry his own extra diapers and a sippy cup. I love it and saves room in my bag! Love the quality of the product too. I'm looking to buy some jackets and gear from Outside Baby too.
3,Good but not great,"The memory chips work well, but the description would be better if it stated there were two chips, not one. I had thought I would be able to increase the memory in my computer even more by obtaining one chip with 512 mb, not two with 256 mb each."
2,23 Days of Terror was 5 hours of pure boredom.,"I'm not a big fan of true crime books, and this book is a perfect example why. Among the many reasons, the one that sticks out the most is that they can be very poorly thought out. I want to read, in detail, what happened at every scene; not just the same thing we already know from watching the news last year. I want to know all the steps the detectives made in catching the suspects. 23 Days of Terror seems to be more of a biography on Muhammad, Malvo and their thirteen victims than a detailed review of the Beltway sniper investigation. Yes, I feel sorry for the victims and I do know that the author was just writing in those mini biographies out of respect for the dead and injured, but that could've been put in a separate chapter at the end of the book. I'm sorry, but the life of a middle aged landscaper really doesn't interest me when I'm trying to read a book about a murder investigation..."
2,Re: the reviews following my original.,"I already explained why I didn't like the book. True crime books are supposed to have a detailed description of the crime, all the clues, leads, and tips that lead up to the arrest of the suspect(s). 23 Days of Terror was more of an homage to the victims than anything; and in all honesty, I find that boring. If you want to see what a good true crime book should be like, read The Brown's Chicken Massacre by Maurice Posley. Every detail as to how the police caught the two murderers is written, and Posley still manages to show the respect for the victims, but it's not boring like this one was. As to your distaste for my closing line: excuse me if you can't take a joke. You act as if you live in the only city that has ever had a serial killer. Just because your city's tragedy happened to be on CNN doesn't make you Yoda."
5,The Bible,"I work in finance as a software developer. I had done some work with risk management and had read Jorion's book and Butler's. When I had to do my own VaR implementation, a colleague recommended Holton's book. It is amazing. The level of domain expertise is above anything else out there. It is sophisticated and well written. I thought I knew about VaR before reading Holton, but I didn't really. Now I know about VaR.I noticed that someone has been posting negative reviews of the book here on Amazon. Those reviews are blatantly dishonest. I assume they are posted by a jealous competing author.Holton is the bible."
2,A good book on VaR,"A good book on VaR, but finally lost its charming. Incomplete and solved cases in a pathetic manner. Theory: 80%, Practice: 10%, pathetic exercises 10%. This book doesn?t reflect its complete main purpose: theory and practice. I would choose mastering Value at Risk by Cormac Butler and Value At Risk by Jorion. My rate is 2 stars. Do it again. Don?t forget solved cases in spreadsheets."
5,Great Crate,Easy to put together and very sturdy. We have had ours for a year and still looks new. Dog is very comfortable and enjoys sleeping in it or taking naps. Good crate and great price.
2,"Crate is fine, but packaging was destroyed","Either UPS brutalized this thing in transport and had to tape it back up or we were sent a previously opened item. Crate seems fine, but there are no instructions (leading me to believe it was previously opened)."
5,Great Kennel at a great price!!!,Perfect size for our two boxer-malinios mixes. They will be able to grow up without needing a different living space.
2,Look at one of these set up first,"We bought this crate [Midwest 1154U 54-By-35-By-45-Inch Single-Door Starter Series Pet Crate] for a new Great Dane puppy. We also bought the pan and divider.The directions where terrible and when we got the crate assembled everything went together except the top was too big from side to side by about an inch. I contacted the company and was told ""That was impossible"", I assured them it was not. We assembled this crate so that the sharp edged hooks, located vertically in the center of the side panels, faced the outside of the crate so the puppy would not get hurt on them. The sides go up in two sections per side and are joined in the center with hooks and a long rod holding them together. I am trying to rectify this problem but it would seem that the woman in customer care is telling me that the sharp hooks face the inside of the crate. Look for one set up somewhere to make sure it is safe for your pup before you purchase it on line"
5,One of the nicest looking crates for your home,"I purchased this crate[...]for my dog and she loves it. We already had one for our other cavalier spaniel and decided to get a second one so that each dog would get one. Well, they both sleep in the one. I am going to decorate it with tube lights for Christmas. They will love it. It is so attractive and was easy to put together. Shipping was quick!"
2,Disappointed that I paid good $ for something to be broken.,"The good-The crate was fairly easy to assemble, sturdy enough for our large Great Dane, and the correct size, as described.The bad-One of the metal bars came broken. I considered sending it back but it would be a hassel and the bar that was broken wasn't an ""important"" one."
2,Does NOT do the job.,"I have a 130lb female great dane. I figured a cage with a great dane pictured on the packaging would be suitable for a great dane, seems logical, right?I locked my dane in here and left the room. she escaped in moments. All that needs to be done to escape is to press with enough force to pop open the front. I went in myself and could easily escape by simply pressing the gate with enough force.The latches are not long enough to stand the force of a dane pushing the door. The next try she grabbed it with her teeth and pulled the front gate, this caused the entire front to come loose from the rest of the crate. Because the front came loose there were sharp edges that cut her nose.I would not buy this again, and DO NOT recommend. I have remedied my crate by attaching all pieces with zip ties, and need two padlocks to keep my dog in without injuring herself trying to escape."
2,It works but its not what I was expecting,"The directions are confusing (just follow the pictures and your own common sense), it doesn't feel 100% sturdy, many pieces were bent on arrival because the box was in bad shape with many holes in it (which made it even harder to fit together), and it's so big you are going to need a second person to help you for sure.That being said, it contains my Great Dane just fine. Ample headroom, decent width for turning around, and good length for sleeping. It does its job. I feel like you get what you pay for at this price, since most other crates of this size go for well over $200.Would have been nice if it folded down. Not looking forward to having to move it anytime soon."
1,"Warning, may be dangerous for a strong willed Dog","When it was time to move our Shepherd up to a larger crate we thought this would be ideal, it was not the brand we had bought in the past however the size attracted us. Our dog is strong willed and his sole ambition in life is to get out of any crate you put him in, his last crate lasted him 18 months before he rendered it unusable. This crate lasted less than 2 hours the main concern is once he demolished the tray he then pulled apart the bottom bars breaking the welds he had pulled up one of the bars and it was sticking up around 9"" into the crate, fortunately he had not hurt himself on this, the next pet may not be so lucky. If you have a strong willed dog and value your pet stay away from this product. We have many pets and cages this is the first time we have purchased a Midwest product and will be the last there are many better brands of Chinese rubbish out there."
2,Okay,"My dog escaped this cage...with a cone on his head. My last attempt to review this item was rejected for some reason, so I'm just making this short."
4,"Wow, didn't expect it to be so big.","I needed to get my dog a new crate because he was getting way too big for his old one. I didn't expect this crate to be 3X the size of him! Really think about the dimensions before you buy it. It takes up a large amount of space, so be prepared. I'm 5'2"" and 110 pounds you can fit two of me in it easily (sitting down of course). Overall my dog, Black Lab Pit Bull Mix and Great Dane, likes it. He has extra room even when standing up. The plastic pan was cracked before I opened the box; that could be the roughness of shipment though. The assembly is fairly easy; although, I did need an extra set of hands. You can't beat the price."
3,Two already published books in one cover.,"This book is Werenight and Prince of the North reisssued as a single volume. I liked both of these books, but the online listing does not make it clear that this is already published material. I was quite dissapointed when I received the book and discovered I had already read it."
4,Yes it's a re-issue,Wisdom of the Fox combines two of the previous Gerrin the Fox Novels (Werenight & Prince of the North) and doesn't add any new material however they are good stories and gives readers of the later books in the series to complete their collection. And the information that it is a re-print is clearly stated on the publishers web site.
2,I'd rate this higher except for two important factors:,"1. First, the book is less than 130 pages, and none of it is in color.2. More important...all the comics inside this book (including the first ones about how Calvin met Hobbes) are included verbatum in the later, longer, more colorful book ""The Essential Calvin and Hobbes (A Calvin & Hobbes Treasury)"". Spend a couple extra dollars and buy that one instead."
5,Gotta have it,Calvin and Hobbes...truly innocent and funny books. My son collected each and every book and now my daugter is starting her own collection.
5,Trip down memory lane,"I purchased this to read and reminisce, and Bill Watterson hits the spot. I'll read this book until the day I die."
5,BEST COMICS!!!!,"This is a comic that you can read over and over and over and over and over and over again. You get to know the characters, like Calvin's habit of using huge long words, Hobbes's habit of not eating fat kids,etc. What a pity Bill Watterson retired. I would love to read more of these!!"
4,The first Calvin and Hobbes collection = fun!,"Calvin and Hobbes is one of the most consistently fun and entertaining comic strips of all time. If you don't enjoy it you're not a kid, don't have kids and probably never were a kid. Watterson does a great job telling the reader everything they need to know in each three or four panel daily strip. Fun for everyone!"
3,It's a nice ring but doesn't look like the picture,"First off, it's a light blue or light turquoise stone, not a bright blue stone like in the picture so I was kind of disappointed. Pretty, but not what you see in the image. Secondly, there is very little color contrast between the gold-toned side pieces and the rest of the ring in silver. Being that the ring is much smaller than what you see in the picture, the gold really doesn't show up much. So in essence, it looks like a silver ring, not two-tone.That being said, it's a nice ring. Well-made and pretty and true to size. I have been wearing it fairly often."
3,Color not deep,"Got this ring today. The color is NOT the deep blue shown. More of a very light blue and the cut on the stone does not show it to its best advantage. You see a large flat area at the center of the stone so there is very little ""sparkle"" and ""fire"". The setting is nice but the lack of a deep blue colored, well cut stone keeps this ring from being a 5."
1,"it's not deep blue showed in the picture. returned it, having not received refund after 40 days","it's my first return, but it went bad. No refund after 40 days. The topaz is light blue, not deep blue, very disappointed."
3,nascar racing #4,"first i did not get a book of instructions with the game?? i had to learn on my own. my pit crew is not visible, don't know how to find them? the game goes in stop motion from time to time and the sound goes off all the time. i think it should be more simple to operate--to many buttons on the key board that changes things. in part the game is real fun and i plan on buying nascar 2002 soon. i just hope i get a book this time."
3,"Great, but disappointing","I agree with the high marks this game is getting, but in their zeal for realism, the folks at Papyrus again left out a way to save races, so unless you have copious amounts of free time (3-4 hours at a stretch), want to leave the game paused day to day, or only want to run short sprints, I'd wait until they hopefully come up with a patch to correct this. I want to run full length races so I feel like I've wasted my money (and a fair amount of racing time before I found out)."
2,All glitter no guts,"Sure it looks real. Everybody has beat that topic to death. The problem is this toy just isn't an adequate race simulator. The computer cars don't act like real drivers would. They seem to be programmed to give you a hard time rather than to be realistic. The physics aren't quite right either - get down underneath a car in a turn and he may send you into the inside wall! Wait a for more months and you'll probably see some more realistic, time-tested reviews."
5,this is the best game ever,This game is cool becasue it has cool 3d grafits and i hope they make nascar racing 5.
3,missing serial number,I bought this for my kids but haven't gotten to use it because I lack the serial number to get it started. I heard it was a great game but I wouldn't know. . .
1,Waste of money!,"This title is compete waste of your money, this is an arcade style racer, do your self a favour, save your money!"
3,"Great graphics, but frustrating for a beginner!","This is my first NASCAR racing sim. Though I was wowed by the options, graphics (runs INCREDIBLE on a Pent 4), and ability to customize cars, I am frustrated by the really impossible gameplay from the keyboard. After a few hours of racing I was able to get around some of Daytona's turns going around 100mph (while having lines of cars pass me down low), but still managed to nail the wall on turn 2 almost every time. If you are going to buy this game plan to shell out some cash for a wheel too."
5,What a great game!!,"My two grandchildren (boys ages 7 and 10) reported that this game is awesome. They and their mother had a little trouble figuring out how to get it started, but once that was done they said this was about the best software they had. Graphics are tremendous."
5,Blown Away,"I had Nascar 3 and Nascar 4 just blows it away! Includes all manufacturers even Dodge and has almost every car in real life! the graphics are awesome but you better have a good computer to run the game. The only cars that i have noticed don't exist in the game are the #9 Dodge, the #19 Dodge, and the Coors Light car."
4,Little Monsters,"I was very happy to receive the book quickly, and it was exactly as I expected, very good quality book."
3,Not the scent I'd hoped for,"I love the woodsy/earthy smell of patchouli, and use a drop or two of patchouli oil in my unscented lotion. Unfortunately, this talc is a bit too ""perfumy"" for me; not that same woodsy smell that patchouli oil has. If you use it conservatively in combination with C-M sandalwood, the scent combination is pretty nice."
5,Everybody should read this book,"It's hard to explain how and why, but this is the key to all the unanswer questions about human life circle."
4,Incredible,"I have been in many relationships in my life, and the number of love gone wrong stories i could tell would be enough for a book of my own. However, I find that letting other people do the writing allows me to enjoy the plight of the dating world with a little bit more of a sence of seperatism.What i loved about this calender was the raw truth of it, the incredible attention to the obvious things that we all miss so often, and the incorporation of humor to make it more pallatable. So many of my ex's fit into the chapters of the book, and reading the daily quotes give me the constant self-esteem boost to realize that the perfect person does exist, and that all the wrong ones in the world can't stop that.Great product, great messages, great fun."
4,Moving Documentary about Women Stuck in a Legal System,"I'm an acquaintance of the Director and picked this up as soon as it was available. Some of the women's stories will hit you harder than you'd expect them to, but they are all moving. I highly recommend this to anyone who has had abuse in their life or the lives of their loved ones. I also recommend it to any organization who wants to raise awareness of battered women. This does its job of painting the picture of how bleak the situations are for these women with no where to turn, and for informing people of how backwards and frustrating the legal system can be to only a small portion of those who are lost within it."
5,I love these flakes,"This is the first time I have bought or tried any of the Natures Path cereals. I live in a rural area, and am disabled, so I have to depend on my husband to do the grocery shopping. I don't know if they sell these where he shops, but, I am very greatful to Amazon for carrying a pretty good selection of food products in large amounts. Anything that is going to last for a while, like this cereal, I put in the freezer so there is no problem with it going bad. This cereal is pretty crunchy, but, a little thick. Other than that they have a very good taste to me I also like the fact that there is nothing artificial. Also, if you add some of Bob's Red Mill Meusli to the flakes, it really kicks it up a notch, with more grains and texture. I plan to try every one of the Natures Path cereals, but it might take a while!"
3,Nature's Path Organic Mutigrain,Good price! Shipping cost is high. Packaging is terrible! I thought it was just randomly but both times were the same...no packing material...cereal arrived 3/4 crushed!
2,too large,takes up way too much space for the amount of water flow that it provides. I have two other power heads in the tank that take up much less space and provide more water flow.
4,Good Headphones for Portable CD Players,"If you want a pair of fairly inexpensive headphones for a portable CD player, try the CV200. They have high efficiency and fairly good bass. They don't have the high frequency resolution of better phones, but have much better sound than 90 percent of all the headphones that come with CD players. Comfort is OK, and they adjust enough to fit most people. The bonus earphones are not worth much."
5,These are the BEST. Ordering a 2nd pair.,I use mine all the time. I ordered them in 2003 and they still work. I'm ordering a 2nd pair before they stop selling them! They are comfortable and the sound quality is good. They muffle outside noises well.
2,ugh... most uncomfortable headset ever,"When my CV-320's crapped the bed, I took a visit to FYE to get some new ones only to find they didn't carry the 320's, so thinking, ""it's Coby, the last pair was good"" I bought them only to find that I hated them. Not only was the volume level not even close to that of the 320's, but after about 20-30 minutes, my ears hurt. Making it impossible to wear these for a lengthy period of time."
3,"Good, but not Great!","I was impressed with the amount of stuff you get for the price. I was surprised that there was an audio adapter included in the package. However, after using the earbuds on a flight, I became a little less impressed. I had to keep pulling the plug and reinserting them into my computer jack to get them to work. It wasn't the computer, because the headphones work just fine. I don't have to manipulate the plug to get them to work, like the earbuds. Good buy for the price, but not a great one."
4,What a value and sounds decent too,I gave around $10 for these and the sound is on par with much more costly phones. The downside is the wire is cheap and doesn't last real long. If you are gentle with them you might get a year or more out of them before you start having trouble with the wires.
3,Sound great but not made well .,"I've owned many pairs of this brand / model .Very comfortable and great sound .More than well worth the price.Unfortunately , they don't last long at all .My current pair didn't last 2 weeks before one side started cutting in and out (loose connection).Even though you can prolong their life by constantly wiggling wires around , still very annoying .As long as I can keep finding good deals on them I will continue to buy them .I would gladly pay more for them for better workmanship ."
2,Headphones are not up to snub,"The ear buds have hopeless sound quality and aren't worth using, so don't purchase this product just because the ear buds are thrown in. The headphones do have decent sound quality, but they are very snug. I have a small head (circumference) and they are so tight that after an hour or so, my ears are hurting from the pressure of the headphones. Also, even when the volume is quite low, people around me can hear the sound through the headphones."
4,Intriguing material presented in rather dull style.,"Full of useful information you can find nowhere else.But I find Landes' style overly precise and technical. His fans (legion) might describe it differently: sharply exact, accurate and delimited.Typical sentence: ""Multiplicity of function entailed variation in nomenclature"".OK, we all understand that sentence but how much do we enjoy it?I believe the samples on the 'look inside' feature at Amazon presents a fair example of what to expect (pages 15 and following).The footnotes are at the back of the book.The illustrations and figures not easy to make out.Excellent index and appendices."
4,"Outstanding information, sometimes a tough read","The guy who wrote this seems to like using big words just for the sake of using them. I have never seen the information in this book anywhere else. It is a great history of timekeeping. If you're fascinated with clocks or watches and would like to get some true education, pick up a copy of this book. Just be warned that it is not a book that most people can just breeze through."
1,Painfully uncomfortable,"This ""gel"" seat cover is worse than the hard saddle it covers. So-called ""gel"" is not soft, it's firm, and this has two sausage rolls of it that focus your weight along two narrow lines, right at the bruise points that made you buy it in the first place. Find something flat, not something with two hard painful ridges like this."
3,Moderately Useful,"I worked at a rather ""urban"" school, in the suburbs, so I can't imagine what I saw was so different from ""normal,"" but I was pretty unprepared for what I experienced after reading this book. Some of the ideas were helpful, but not enough. It's still worthwhile reading, but I'd probably borrow it from the library and ead it once, rather than buying it to keep on my shelf.The subtitle definitely over-sells the book.#1 thing I would add: ""expect that, every week, some once-a-year or once-a-semester task will come up that will take between 5 - 40 hours. Try to find out about these in advance, but don't expect you'll be able to.""#2 thing I would add: ""Try not to start with a new principal, or a new department head. They'll be too busy learning their jobs to properly support you with yours."" I had both, and am now a former teacher.There's plenty more, but I can't write my own book here."
3,Good information,"I found this book to have really good information all around. However, I wish it had addressed some of the more ""uneducational"" strategies. For example: what do you initially do if a student starts a fight in your classroom (break it up and risk touching a student vs. call for help and potentially let the underdog get the tar beat out of him), if someone gets sick and throws up, how do you handle kids that say ""I don't have to do this work, I'm getting out of this class anyway,"" how to address modifications for IEP's without singling out the child in class, How important it is that you keep the right frame of mind and don't let yourself get bullied by the kids FROM DAY ONE!, etc.Over all, it was a good basis for reading, but I found other books more specifically informative."
3,"Should be called ""Basic Statistical Analysis Using SQL""","My perspective is that I do not consider basic statistics a part of Data Mining. By basic statistics, I mean ANOVA, regression, etc. Therefore, I feel the title is misleading. Only basic statistical analysis is shown using SQL. Data Mining techniques are not covered.As far as statistical analysis .... The Design of Experiments chapter does not cover replicated ANOVA, and does not even mention factorial designs. The Time Series chapter does not cover autoregressive-moving average models.If you want a book that implements some of Excel's Analysis Tools routines in SQL, then this book is for you. If you want an introduction to data mining techniques, look elsewhere."
3,Data Mining and Statistical Analysis Using SQL,"This would be a good book for Statistical Analysis using SQL, but it lacks the other side of data mining-data visualization. I hope the authors would include some non-statistical techniques of data mining in their future edition.At the meanwhile, reader may read other books, such as C. Westphal's Data Mining Solutions, for non-statistical data visualization techniques."
1,Strange Collection of Summary Statistics in SQL,"This book is not about data mining at all, but implementing an unusual collection of summary statistical procedures in SQL. For those interested in data mining, get a book on data mining using actual data mining tools."
1,Worst idea ever.,"I bought this at a bookstore right when it came out, as I've always been a huge Nightwish fan. I was hoping to find out new facts about one of my favorite bands, but I was disappointed. There is no new info on this cd, no interviews with the band except for a few snippets of one interview pasted sloppily onto the beginning of each track. The background music is repetative and obnoxious. If you want to learn more about Nightwish, you'll find better facts and interviews for free online."
3,Walton concerto,Whatever the merits or otherwise of Bell's playing of the marvellous Walton Violin concerto the simple fact is that Kyung Wha Chung with Andre Previn and the LSO recorded this work back in 1970 thereby setting a new standard of interpretation which has yet to be equalled and the recorded sound is still remarkably good.
4,Good Memories for New Yorkers,We live in a retirement community in Maryland and get together monthly to talk and remember our earlier lives in New York City. These DVDs are great - even the silent ones give us something to remember.
5,By by fat,Good product helps me shred some fat after i go to bead speeds up my metabolism good if combined with a fat burner will see major results
1,"2 Remingtons Broke On Me, Under Very Light Usage","Just wanted to warn you all, DO NOT buy a Remington nose hair trimmer. You will be sorry. I have gone through 2 of them already with very light usage, a black narrow one and a silver one just like this one. They are very cheaply made and only last a short time, before #1 just stopped working and #2: cheap plastic switch broke off (it will not reattach back on to the unit) making it useless. Only 1 year warranty & they break shortly after that. I only used them once or twice a month, handled them very gently, never dropped them."
1,Don't buy this model for any reason....it's junk.,"You get what you pay for, and it is so very true in this case. It's a waste of time, plastic, and your time."
2,Good while it lasted!!!,"I actually liked the trimmer. Did what it's suppose to, UNTIL, the bottom broke off when turning it on one time. I think I will check out a different one next time. Can get costly if it keeps breaking."
1,Won't turn on,"This nose hair trimmer worked fine for a few months, but now I put a fresh battery in and it will not even turn on. I kept trying the switch and it worked sporatically, clearly the switch is broken or motor has failed. Spend your money on a better one."
1,"Wow, this is REALLY a bad trimmer","My last trimmer, made by Braun broke after 4 years, bought this to replace it and was amazed by how poor it is. It hardly cuts anything. Lots of noise, looks cool, but doesn't really work. At all. Wierd. Don't buy!"
1,Simply does not work,"I thought I would splurge on a new trimmer since my old Panasonic was dying. This thing does not work. when I first tried it, I thought it must have some sort of packaging to prevent the blades from working when new out of the box. I looked inside the head and the blades were spinning. I don't know what the deal is, but it DOES NOT WORK.Save you money."
1,waste of money for junk,"dont buy this piece of junk,it has a nice design but it doesnt work at all,i threw it in garbage"
1,JUNK ~ JUST DOESN'T WORK! DUH,"WOW. Remington, you sell us a trimmer that doesn't trim. what a scam? What a waste of time and money!"
1,Save your money!!,"Nothing to say good about this product. Save your money and buy regular small cuticle scissors. Of course get the kind with a rounded end. This product does not work. It is cute, comes with another trimmer type and both are useless."
1,Horrible product,"How I wish I had read the reviews here before buying. The trimmer simply did not work and, after three months, it's broken beyond repair. Believe me, I was super gentle with it as I paid way too much for it. Because I paid so much, I kept trying to use it. I adjusted it, switched the heads out, etc., but it never, ever worked correctly. The sideburn trimmer on my very old electric razor does a MUCH better job, sad to say. It's trimming capabilites are non-existent and it goes without saying that I expected it to last longer than three months.Stay far, far away. I am extremely disappointed because Remington usually makes fine products. They struck-out with this one."
3,Cheaper in walmart!,"I bought this and it was fine, but it came after a week!I realised that it would have been cheaper in walmart as the shipping cost was greater than the cost of the item itself!"
2,Doesn't cut worth a darn,"Blades won't cut, almost at all. The previous version of a Remington trimmer I had worked great. It died on me unfortunatly. This one is a waste of money. I don't know why they couldn't keep making them like my old one. But then if they did that, they wouldn't be able to sell new ones and make more money."
2,Awesome Product,Worth Full to buy this product. I dont comment on price. But the Quality is very good.
4,Great Product,"Personal hygiene/grooming should remain...well...personal! That being said this is a great product. It will get the job done easily, quickly, and with no irritation. My trimmer came with free AA ""Heavy Duty"" batteries but only Alkaline batteries are recommended. That's the reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 star rating."
1,Dreadful!,Completely useless. It buzzes and does not cut. O tossed it in the garbage and bought a Panasonic that works!
1,"Broken before I opened it, switch designed to fail","While I realize the market is driving some of these design decisions and Remington is no different than any other budget nose hair trimmer, it was a bit of a shock to find that the switch is even more cheaply designed to fail rapidly than the budget nose hair trimmer I bought previously (Remington NE-1). At least with the NE-1, I was able to repair the switch with a piece of sheet brass when it failed. This new trimmer's switch is designed to fail and be hard to repair.Device was broken when I opened it up from the annoying blister pack. I should have shopped around more.Cheap, disposable crap guaranteed to need replacing way too soon and fill up land fills."
2,Not as good as the reviews make it out to be,"So I recommended this book to the friends based on a review I had read of it. Now that I've actually read the book, I have to say that it was not very thought-provoking, only annoying.As a historical account of Galileo's trial before the Inquisition, as well as of his life and work, it was interesting. But Rowland puts entirely too much of his own spin on the events, and he attacks science by setting up a straw man in the character Berkowitz, thereby devaluing whatever legitimate points he might have had."
5,Awesome & Fast,"It came super fast! I was absolutely amazed. It was in perfect condition. I was able to give it to my friend just in time for her birthday, all wrapped and prettied up. She loved it!"
3,Its great but it could have been betrer...,I loved the show when my friend introduced me to it so i bought the DVD sets. while the last season was good it was way too short. I left too many unanwserd questions. But all in all it was a good season.
4,"Great TV show, disapointing end",Loved the show and its a great season. Feels a little incomplete since the show was cancelled after this season. It's a bit like a sci-fi version of 7th Heaven at some times but definatly worth a watch.
3,ABC IS AT IT AGAIN!!,"ABC IS BIG ON QUITTING A REALLY GOOD SHOW BEFORE IT REALLY ENDS. THEY DIDIT TO LOIS AND CLARK YEARS BACK. MOVED THEM FROM THIS DAY TO THAT AND THEN SAID THEY HAD LOST THEIR RATING.!!THANK GOODNESS I HAD COPIED IT!!AND OF COURSE I COPIED KYLE XY. VERY GOOD SHOW.. DON'T KNOW WHETHER ITWAS WRITERS OR COST FOR THIS ONE. SAME FOR FLASH GORDON, AND ANOTHER FAVORITE--ELI STONE WITH JOHNNY LEE MILLER. I'M 82, GREAT GRANDMA 9X,SO AM I IN MY 2ND CHILDHOOD, OR JUST DIDN'T GROW UP, CAUSE I LOVE THESE KID SHOWS!"
2,KYLE XY,"i for one will wait for this to come down it isn't worth paying 25 dollars and tax and shipping handling for 10 eps. on it and because it leaves you hanging with no finishing to the show. the family is taken,kyle is told that the guy he was working for is his brother and there is to much unfinished business on this show to pay 25 dollars for them to rip us off like that. so if you intend to buy it wait till someone sells theirs."
3,What to expect!,"I liked the series when it was on TV. So, I decided to buy both the 1st. & 3rd. & final year. It was exactly as I remembered.I was disapointed in the last year. They lefy you hangin', not knowing the end & what happened to Kyle."
3,The end of a great tv show,"Well, this pack cointains the ten episodes of the third and last season of Kyle XY, the show about the boy with no belly button. Kyle XY is an awesome show. I like it, the two previous seasons are incredible. Ten episodes aren't enough to finish all well, don't expect a happy ending, but the end will leave you with my mouth open.List of episodes:Kyle XY S03E01 It Happened One NightKyle XY S03E02 Psychic FriendKyle XY S03E03 Electric KissKyle XY S03E04 In The Company Of MenKyle XY S03E05 Life SupportKyle XY S03E06 Welcome To LatnokKyle XY S03E07 Chemistry 101Kyle XY S03E08 The Tell-Tale HeartKyle XY S03E09 Guess Who's Coming To DinnerKyle XY S03E10 Bringing Down The House"
5,VERY EXCITING!!,"Some co-workers of mine purchased this book several years ago and read it aloud during their lunch hour. They would make comments that they couldn't wait until lunch time the following day to be able to read more, as the book kept them on the edge. After listening to them for several days, I ordered the book, and I could not put it down! The author's incredible imagination keeps the mystery going all the way to the end of the book, making it extremely unpredictable, which is crucial for a good mystery!! Great book -- highly recommend it. I am now reading Michael Frase's The Last Goodbye, which has been fantastic so far!"
3,Not bad,"I liked this book, but I thought it was a little too long. There wasn't a lot of suspense or excitement in the middle of the story. However, I did like the characters and the plot. I would buy another book by this author."
2,I wanted to like it but....,"I developed an allergic reaction to it. The licorice-like aroma was heavenly, but after using it, I developed a horrible itchy rash that lasted a few days."
1,Complete garbage,"Tried to use this item, and one screen was fuzzy. Yes, I tested it with different cables and monitors and it was definitely because of the switch. Exchanged the item for another, which had a similar problem, tinting the entire display screen blue. Not wanting to waste my time sending it back, I played with it for a while to make sure it was a defective switch. It was. Buyer beware."
5,Works great,"This device seems to be fairly well constructed and works perfectly. I connect two monitors to one CPU and for this, it is exactly what I need."
4,Startech VGA switch,Suits my purpose just fine. (two PCs sharing one monitor) Some times have to wiggle the switch a bit to get a good picture when flipping from one PC to the other but then don't have to touch it again. Had a little bit of ghosting at first but either I got used to it or it went away. Well worth the price. Case is a bit flimsy but not a problem.
5,All the songs are superb,Usally when you buy a CD you get at the most 3 or 4 songs that are good and the rest are unbearable and make you regret having spent your money. WITH THIS CD YOU GET YOUR WHOLE MONEY WORTH BECAUSE ALL THE SONGS ARE EXCELLENT (LYRICS AND INTERPRETATION) FIVE STARS OUT OF FIVE STARS WITH NO DOUBT.
4,Makita Porta Table,"The Makita Porta Table has been a very valuable asset for obtaining the maximum capabilities of my Makita 2703 Table Saw. The saw at 15 amps and with excellent debth cutting capabilities, is hampered by a medicore at best fence. The Porta Table adds excellent ripping capabilites and a very accurate fence to the 2703. Other accessories such as an out-feed table, ripping extension, and a Router insert (available from Tool Crib/Amazon under the Rosseau name) make this a very verstile tool. The table breaks down very easily and stores or transports well, taking a minimum of space. It is worth the price, but if it where a little less expensive I would give it 5 stars."
1,Don't Waste your money,"These are terrible collars. I bought a half dozens of these because I have 2 male cats that refuse to stay in during the day and come home without their collars constantly. So I thought buy cheap ""right"" WRONG, when Louie came home and his collar was tight I first thought it was my mistake, but a few days latter it was tight again. Then I thought some bad person was responsible, but when I took it off, the collar had shrunk so I put another new one on and about a week or so latter the same thing happened. I threw the lot of them out. I"
5,A laugh a minute,"I have just spent the last two hours watching Carrot Top's 'Chairman of the Board' for the first time. It was so good I watched it fifteen times. I love his crazy hair, his bucked teeth and big ears. My favourite bit was when Elmer was walking through the forest with his hunting gun and says ""Be vewy, vewy, qwuiwet. I'm hunting wabbits! he! he! he! he!"". The next thing you know Carrot Top leaps out of a hole and hollers ""What's up Doc?"" gnaws on a carrot and he dives back into the hole. This film has exactly three hundred and nine jokes and I laughed at three hundred and eight of them and that was only because I was out of the room every time that joke was executed.Carrot Top's 'Chairman of the Board' is comedy genius, the jokes are fresh and ahead of their time. This film is so funny I think that it should be banned as I nearly died laughing.I award this film five stars a WG Sinclair big double thumbs up."
5,CARROT TOPS THE CAKE OF LIFE,IF YOUR QUESTIONING the meaning of life. watch this film and you will not only laugh but you will find a deep spiritual reliazation.
3,"I did the DVD interface graphics, tell me what you think!","I was involved with creating the graphics for the DVD interface, so I had to watch the movie about 5 times, but there are 3 or 4 funny lines. (Larry Miller, mostly) You know Courney Thorne-Smith is a terrific actor because there's a scene where she kisses Carrot Top, and she doesn't make a face or anything. Watch for the foible where Carrot Top calls her ""Courtney"" instead of her character's name (in the museum). But anyway, the DVD's design was ""all me"" so if you liked it, tell me what you think!"
1,Chairman of the Bored,"Carrot Top brings the annoying to new heights in ""Chairman of the Board."" He stars as Edison, an inventor who loves to surf and finds out that his ideas are being stolen by the evil new CEO. There are numerous unfunny sight gags-including one that involves the evil CEO eating office supplies. Carrot Top,who looks like the carrot/root vegetable male version of cat lady Joycelyn Wildenstein, saves the day with his strange car and realization that his Glow Goo was being used against him.Raquel Welch makes a thankless cameo,one wonders if she was nostalgic about ""Myra Breckinridge"" in which she starred as Rex Reed's feminine alter ego. Courtney Thorne-Smith stars as Carrot Top's hapless girlfriend,and there's a disgusting love scene at the end that gives heterosexuality a bad name.""Chairman of the Board"" is engrossing in a bad way. It's so bad you can't tear your eyes away. Since it is full of tired jokes,""Chairman of the Bored"" is more fitting."
1,i want my 95 minutes back...,"one of the ten worst movies i have ever witnessed. not even remotely funny in a ""so bad it's good"" way. i loathe him.he makes gallagher seem funny...(...)"
1,"Should have been called Chairman of The ""Bored""","It's a homophone...get it?Lookin' like a chick on steroids is no way to go through life, son..."
5,I was an atheist...,"...until I saw this film. I believe in God now. I lost 75 pounds. My hair turned jet black from its original gray. I grew 2 inches, in height. 3 inches elsewhere, if you know what I mean. I won the lottery and my recently deceased dog has returned to me as a puppy, who can speak perfect English.I am afraid to watch it again. I couldn't handle the bliss."
1,It's good to see Yahoo Serious working again,"Of course he ditched the accent- Wait, no it's the guy who played Malachi in children of the corn. It's good to see him working again."
2,Does imitation Vanillia taste as good?,"Carrot Top has some inventions (like the TV dinners with real TVs inside) and some jokes (He can't work for Wendy's hamburgers because he looks too much like Wendy) that I found to be quite funny. When the story uses fresh new ideas, it's funny. But when it simply mimics other people, it could be just a guy with a red wig on his head trying too hard for laughs."
5,"Cool, no matter what all these other Scrooges say","I don't care what all these people say, this is a very cute movie with some great visual gags and a nice sense of humor.Give it a chance, you'll be charmed. As one reviewer said, it somewhat recalls an old Frank Tashlin movie."
5,A wonderful film...,"...that deserves to be released on DVD! ""Hear My Song"" is a charming story with unique and disarming characters. Well-acted by James Nesbitt, Adrian Dunbar, and Ned Beatty (as the exiled Irish tenor). We even have the soundtrack, which my children ask to hear. I can't say enough about this movie. Again, it deserves to be released on DVD."
4,Right On!,We all fall in line for love . . . it even brings the infamous Joe Locke back to England. A happy little low budget diversion that proves a good time doesn't require fancy sets or glamourous stars. The parts those two assistants play are the least physically attractive but the warmest in the movie.
4,Hear My Song,"This is a cute little film. Ned Beaty plays an Irish tenor, Josef Locke, who has fled England for Ireland and has hidden out there for years. This part is based on the true life of Josef Locke who was a very famous tenor and you can find some of his work on You Tube. Adrian Dunbar co-wrote this film and plays the young night club manager who must find Josef Locke because he has hired an impersonator and caused family and friend a lot of grief. There is some good music and some funny adventures. Stating that it is a small budget film, I would still give it 4 starts. I recommend it."
3,A Delightful Romp,"I have a fondness for quirky little films, because they are usually made by some of the best new film makers of their day. Hear my song is a perfect example of a great little film. It is all about the journey. And the journey is the life and soul of the story. As a mater of fact I never wanted the journey to end but alas, it does and I was disappointed with the ending. Perhaps had there been a real singer, (other than Ned Beaty) or someone who had the strength of character to play the singer (Brando, Nicholson, Connery) to carry the roll. The end of the film is built up so much through-out the film that when it happens it's a let down. But this is a great romp through the Irish countryside and the life of a theater booker.Adrian Dunbar and his Irish friend make a compelling couple.Very well directed by Peter Chelsom with a director's sense of humour."
3,A bit out of Date,This book was a bit out of date to be as useful as I wanted. There were only a few good pictures and examples that are applicable in today's Office needs.
5,Stevie At His Best,Stevie just gets better as he gets older. There are not too many musicians left that has a track record as long as his. He puts out quality music with substance. What's the Fuss is so upbeat and good dancing music. No one does it better than Stevie.BJ
5,Stevie Wonder at his best,"After seeing Stevie perform this song on the music awards show I knew I had to have it.This CD contains three versions of the song ""So What The Fuss"" and they are BAD (meaning good). If you get the CD be sure to check out the remix with Q-Tip.I don't normally blast my music in my car but with this CD I can't help it.Two thumbs up!"
1,I am sooo disppointed,"We bought this with great expectations, but the videos were defective. SKU will not respond to our complaint, so we will review this wonderful series this way---if you can find a modern set that works, buy it. This is a worthwhile look at early WWII America, and its homey values. It identifies the enemy specifically,and beats the propaganda drum beautifully, if that can be done. Our collector's edition was a bust, but find a merchant other than SKU, and be rewarded with a superb documentary, couched within its own time.SKU...don't mess with loyal Amazon customers. We remember.Blueridge"
1,First Clark mistake,"I always read other people's reviews and sometimes base whether or not I will purchase an item or not by their say so. There was one review on this shoe and I should have listened more carefully. Out of the five or six pairs of Clarks I own, this is the most uncomfortable of all. The instep is too low and cuts into the top of each foot. You will notice it has an elastic band on one side but that does not help. Also the leather is not flexible on the sides of the shoe, futhermore, cutting into the sides of my feet as well. To make things worse, the shoes are a half size bigger than my regular Clark size, 9 M. I decided to keep these though I don't know why. I have patched them with soft moleskin all over the place inside the shoe so they can at least be wearable. I will have to wear knee socks with them because as I stated above, they are at least a half size bigger than my size 9's. I have never written a review that said, ""Don't buy these."" Looks like this is the first time."
4,"Elegant, well priced, not so comfortable","Very nice shoe, for all occasions, however, I would suggest Clarks to allow more room for toes (higher front) when comes to shoes over 7 (37) in size. This will prevent blisters, corns, and bunions, keeping the customer's feet healthy.Ordering and delivery a success."
3,Good dressy shoe,"Loved the style of these shoes. They are really comfortable. They run wide, so make SURE to get the correct width!! Unfortunately, I have to resell these, as I can't keep them on! Now I make sure I get a narrow width."
4,canvas storage box,Good dorm room storage. Would be more practical for college use if it weren't white.
4,"Great product, not so great price.","These are a very nice and easy to use tiedown. For being made in China and comparing to tiedown straps with heavier duty hooks, these are expensive for some nylon rope and and a rolling ratchet. Look at hardware stores for buckle and cinch type tiedown and compare the price for versatility.JC"
4,CD Review,Hello all. I really like this compilation of Stock Aitken & Waterman songs. There are some songs I wish they included however. But nothing is perfect.
3,Great for what it is....,"...but there is one major flaw, in my book anyway: there is absolutely no inclusion of Sigue Sigue Sputnik. What happened? Compilers saw fit to include the likes of Cliff Richard (???...to quote The Young Ones, ""Oh Cliff, sometimes it must be difficult not to feel as if, you really are a cliff, when Fascists keep trying to push you over it, are they lemmings? Or are you Cliff? Or ARE you Cliff?""), but did not include the fall out boys of Generation X? Whatever. Still, it's a very good compilation, with a nifty difty DVD that can be bought separately. But, if you're looking for those SAW mixes and the like of ""Success"" and such by SSS, go for one of their (SSS) compilations."
4,Excellent but Speculative,"This was an excellent, satisfying read. Starbird's assertions are fascinating, but sometimes she makes a big leap of faith not supported by the facts.nevertheless, an excellent read"
3,Passable,"While I liked the basic premise of this book, I just could not come to terms with many of the personal issues that the author spoke about. I wish that Margaret Starbird had left this book as a treatise on hieros gamos and merely explored the concept rather than delving into ""synchronicities"" and ""personal redemption"". I had enjoyed readingThe Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grailbut this book didn't really cut it. In fact,The Rozabal Line, has given a very interesting take on the whole issue of the sacred feminine be exploring the fact that Mary Magdalene's powers could have been derived from the ancient Hindu feminine trinity of Lakshmi, Saraswati and Kali."
3,Women of power,This is a book that explains how women have had their impact distorted by male historians and male interpretations and male power structure. I recommend this. You should also read Ken Agori's novel about the Cursades which explains the role of Mary Magdalen and women in the mystical oders.
4,The Goddess in the Gospels,"Once the Reader gets past the first couple of choppy chapters, the story begins in earnest. Starbird is articulate and heartful, however the book is poorly edited. I was turned off by the shear volume of exclamation points per page. Once I got over that, I was able to appreciate the writer's valuable tale.One ruthless yet compassionate editor could give this book a more universal appeal.Deffinately a book worth reading for truth seekers.aloha."
3,Good Book for the novice that wants to learn about boats...,Good Book for the novice that wants to learn about boats... lots of information and some pictures. More a buyers guide than anything.
3,You won't be able to put it down!,"After reading her husband Tom's kiss off letter, former beauty queen Miranda Smith discovers that he did more than desert her - he also drained their bank accounts, leaving her family owned company, Ballantyne Bras in financial ruin.She also learns that Tom had a penchant for wearing the company garb, when she discovers a revealing photo of him in lingerie, along with a well-manicured female hand.Miranda is forced to take over the company reigns to keep from going under, while trying to locate the cad. Telling the staff that he is on an extended buying trip, then trying to rebuild the business is her goal. But she does not count on Blake Summers, the sexy and suspicious Chief of Police being so interested in her plight.The plot will hook you from page one and the chemistry between the two leads (as well as the comical predicament of a macho father reluctant to let his tomboy daughter grow up) will keep you pasted until the last page."
3,Fairly good Chick Lit...,"This is more of a ""I Am Women Hear Me Roar"" book (not saying there's anything wrong with that), but the romance/main love story is pretty lacking...Here's a little praise to the pepe's in the marketing department and the author; they did do an awesome job with the cover and the title... the story is by all means as cute as the cover. So overall it's a fairly good Chick Lit book and fast read."
4,"Mystery, Romance and Lingerie","`Leave it to Cleavage' by Wendy Wax is the story of Miranda Smith who finds out that her husband wears ladies lingerie, is cheating on her , bankrupted her company, stole all her money and left town all on New Years Day. The local divorced hot police chief begins to investigate and then the story takes some wonderful exciting turns. Take a chance you will enjoy this quick fun read."
1,This a different kind of horror movie.,"This movie has a painter who is caught somewhere between reality and an infomercial. Throughout the movie the artist becomes more and more lost in his unreality until he finally goes off the deep end. I wouldn't call this a true horror movie, I'm not sure what to call it, except an artistic, low budget, and somewhat psychedelic tour through the eyes of a man who is losing his mind."
1,Worst movie ever,I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not horror not anything really but a very boring very slow stoner's idea of a bad camping trip.
4,Nice addition to my collection,Regency is my pattern for my fancier dishes. This will look great with my other pieces. I'm not happy that Johnson Brothers is making this pattern in China now.
1,A waste of time,"If you want analysis based on almost zero research or a few quotes mostly taken out of context, you've come to the right place. Ronnie trashes the life and work of people he obviously knows and cares very little about. This book is so biased - as is his work in Liberation Theology - it is not worth reading. Pick up the book long enough to learn the names of the people he detests, and go read them for your self; they are all well published (and respected)."
1,Hateful and vindictive,"A ""Christian"" book that doesn't quote the Bible? Nash simply trashes authors he disagrees with, offering no scriptural basis for his attacks and instead quoting extensively from a few writers that he admits are ""out of the mainstream."" I'm interested in learning how the religious right scripturally defends their position, but this is a hate-filled, name-calling diatribe."
3,not as good as the debut,"This release from the prog-trance maestro Hallucinogen falls short of the debut cd ""Twisted."" Predictability and uninventivness plague ""Lone Deranger"" from start to finish."
1,Bad Acid Trip,"I was quite disappointed by this CD. Nothing about it was pleasing, dreamy, hallucinogenic, danceable or listenable. Their previous work was much better. There are plenty of other great discs to buy."
2,"Legs detached, won't fold without a battle",We bought these with high hopes and have been very disappointed. Within days of receiving them two of the trays' top leg brace detached from the leg making them unstable and very difficult to fold up. Although they are heavy and appeared to be of good quality we were ultimately disappointed by the trays.
1,Very Disappointing Product,"I purchased these trays in December of 2011. They are pretty, but heavy to move. They have no latch to hold the tray open so they are accident prone to collapse if one bumps the wrong legs. The tray itself is out of composite wood and the coating is not waterproof, so little bumps appears and swell and are discolored if exposed a few times to heat (creating steam) sweating glasses, etc. Also the trays (when set up) are wobbly. Liked my old trays a lot better!"
2,Disappointing Purchase,I had expected that for $81 and the fact that Amazon stood behind this item that it would be a good quality. The package arrived very wet and taped up. The inside packing did keep the tables from getting wet. I could have gotten the same quality at a Walmart or Target for much less money and been at least as satisfied. This is the first item that I have gotten that did not live up to its description.
2,Not the Best Quality,"One more conformation... These trays Do Not match the product picture. Specifically, the top of the tray is a flat looking particle board type of finish. They are not a wood grain finish as shown in the description. I would not order these again."
5,lakers1972,"item not as I expected, a little on the flimsy side, cannot use the rack that came with the TV trays because when loaded the rack tips over. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Damaged and dead on arrival,"Could be a decent product if it wasnt cracked, dented and broken. Should have listened to reviews on Winsome products...This product arrived damaged and unuseable."
4,Great Service!!,They are TV tables what do you want to talk about?? They work and thanks for the quick service!!
3,Nicole,The tables are nice and durable. I amvery happy except two of the table tops havethick streak lines . . . perhaps from thestain. I just put fabric on top. They arenot perfect but much better than what I had.
1,UNSTURDY!,I felt I spent a considerable amount of money for these and it was a waste. The trays are completely unstable and bring more stress into my house than happiness. We are constantly worried about knocking them over. I can't get over how cheap they are. Worst buy ever!
2,Regret this purchase,"Initially we loved these trays. They looked very nice,and were larger than others we've seen or previously owned. After several uses the tops of the tray bubbled and finish wore off from glasses sweating etc. mind you a wet glass wasn't sitting on them for hours on end - just for the duration of the meal. Oh, and the first setting that arrived was missing parts so we had to return them for another.Pros - look nice, larger than most traysCons- tops of tray bubble and finish comes off after normal useThey wobbleDifficult to close and hang back on stand."
1,Christmas Present,"I purchased these at Christmas. The tops are particle board, not ""real wood"" or at least not what I call real wood. In the three months we have had them the tops are scratched and the finish has bubbled. I wish I would have better read the reviews before purchasing."
3,Pretty good,"Great color, and great product looks just like the picture. The only concern is the tables don't have some type of lock when u open them so when u try to move them they can fold up on u."
2,Cheesy,"They don't get much worse than this. Top is particle board with a painted smooth finish. They are wobbly. When you pick one up, it immediately folds, so you need to hold the support bar underneath to move it anywhere or it will collapse."
1,Not real wood,"The description for these trays should read wooden, not wood. The legs are wood, but the tray top itself, is MDF, fiber board, particle board (i.e. NOT REAL WOOD), with a laminate finish. I have had these several month. The trays themselves have proven to be pretty sturdy in my house. However, the tops all have bubbles without exception. Any glass that sweats will leave behind bubbles. The tray stand wobbles and has had to be tightened at least twice in the last 12 months. If we remove one tray, the stand leans. As a result the wall near where these sit has been scuffed quite a bit. I am now looking for real wood tray tables to replace these.Buy these only if you want tray tables that you will have to replace."
3,Cheaper elsewhere,Bought same table at Kmart for $50. They are of OK construction - as good as I could find anywhere. Made in Thailand.
3,Disappointed....,"We were very excited about the extra large, REAL wood TV tables we ordered. But, when they arrived, there was a piece missing that is required for setting up the stand. Conveniently, there was a printout with instructions on how to request missing parts. Go figure. We thought the heavy wood trays would be sturdy... Nope. They were more wobbly than our cheap old timey ones. Between the missing piece and the wobbliness we decided they were defective enough that we wanted our money back. Amazon themselves were absolutely awesome with issuing a return label & number and refunding our money rapidly. No harm done."
2,Not what I expected,"Winsome Wood TV Table SetDefinitely does not look like the picture - the tops do not look like wood - pretty ugly. Also, they are very wobbly."
5,Great Gift,Ordered these for my son and his wife. They're large and sturdy and look great. Just what we/they wanted.
4,tv tray set,"good for the price, easy to wipe down used when neighbors come to watch downton abbey and have dinner together"
5,Love these tables!,These tables are exactly what I was looking for! The color is perfect! Well worth the money. Quality for snack tables
2,Cheap Guitar Strap Buttons,Don't buy them - spend a little more and get something that you can trust to support your preciousl instrument.
1,Great picture. Horrible product. Worst customer service on the planet...,"After going through 4 sets because the screen was warped, the set worked great for 3 years. The lamp did fail after about 3000 hours but was easy to find a replacement and simple to replace.Picture quality and features are awesome. But that's the only good news here.Recently the TV hums/buzzes so loud that it is unbearable to watch. We discovered that it is the color wheel. Well, forget about calling Gateway to help fix the problem. If you can manage to talk to someone who isn't one of the rudest people on the planet then they will kindly tell you that you are f-----.In short. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TV. For that matter NEVER consider buying anything that has Gateway stamped on it. Their products suck! Their service stinks! Gateway at $2 a share? WAY over valued!Any ideas on what I should do with my $3000 paper wieght? I was thinking of smashing it into a million pieces and sending them back to Gateway. Thoughts?"
1,Total rip-off - I thought it was a great deal,"I purchased this TV as the quality and price seemed awesome. And it was great value until the lamp failed at just over 1,000 hours - far short of the 6,000 advertised! I searched the net, and it seems that the average failure is less than 1,500 hours - and at $399 to replace the lamp, it's the most expensive in the industry (most Sony lamps are $150)."
2,It could be so much better,"Get the 4 cd set instead! Or if you're doing it on the cheap look for the single cd version of the Jam's Compact Snap (used), Style Councils's Greatest Hits (cutout) & Paul's Modern Classics (cutout).The best way to do it tho' is get the Jam's DIRECTION REACTION CREATION (5CD BOX), Style Council's THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES OF (5CD BOX) - ok you'll have to put up with the unreleased lp, but still worth it. Then getLive Wood (import only)& the 2disk set Catch Flame. Alright you'll still need Modern Classics but it's a cutout now right?Unfortunately this 1 disk ""sampler"" just doesn't do Paul or his Jam & SC mates justice. Misses some fantastic stuff (Just Who Is The 5 o' Clock Hero?, Ghosts, Fresh Carnation, Little Boy Soldiers, Smithers-Jones (both versions)..."
3,Good Intro to a Legend But....,"The condensed version of HIT PARADE would have been better if it had all 25 of Paul Weller's Top-10 UK Hits. If 25 couldn't fit on the cd, the compilers could cut out the popular top-10 b-sides ""Precious"", ""Dreams of Children"" and ""Paris Match"". Get the 4-cd box set instead."
4,Very well written novel,"This story held my interest on every page. It was very well written, and very interesting. It was a great escape for me. :)I won't re-write what this story is about because other reviewers have done a very good job of it.There is a lot of interesting things going on in this novel, yet it was easy to keep track of and a very easy, fun book to read.I took one star away only because I wanted to like the main character more than I did. Actually, I didn't like either her or her husband. I really liked the mule trainer though. I highly recommend this book, and it doesn't matter much if you like the main character, she is interesting."
5,Lucky At Love: Some Guys Just Never Give Up (hardcover),"""Lucky At Love"" is a totally captivating love story. Seldom do I finish reading a book, usually I lose interest midway through it. I couldn't put this book down. Cynthia Hamilton's writing is so descriptive that I had continuous visual images as I read ~ almost making me feel present in the story. Allison's emotions are so real, it took a lot of self-discipline not to skip to the end of the book to see if it had a fairytale ending.This book is so tastefully written that I didn't hesitate to give a copy to my daughter, as well as one to my best friend. I would definitely recommend this book!"
5,Delighful read!,"I just finished reading Lucky at Love. What a delightful book! The writing was refreshingly descriptive, light and fun. I can't wait to pass this along to other girlfriends and share it with my Book Club. I will be giving this book for a gift to family and friends for upcoming birthdays or Christmas gifts. Thanks for a delightful read!"" Marti Furman, Santa Barbara, CA"
5,Don't miss this one!,"What I loved most about this book is the comedy and compassion given to the subject of love, relationship and the real life taboos that can be involved. The characters are imperfect and have struggles that are easy to relate to which is hard to find in good books about love. The descriptive detail and dialog are rich and gave me that feeling of being inside the story, especially the scenes with Allison and Jake at his Oregon mule ranch which were also some of the most memorable. I have recommended this book to friends many times and I now find myself using the phrase ""lucky at love"" all the time!"
5,Nothing like I've ever heard before,"This artist's voice is nothing like I've ever heard before. It is extremely beautiful. Hot!! I recommend his live show, it is amazing."
1,Waste of money,"I started using this band at my club due to shoulder injury. The rubber handles were ""splitting"" so I bought my own. The handles on my new split after two uses. The handles were not designed to be used with this level of resistance - now I'm out $24 with shipping. Thanks Amazon!"
3,It was slow,I kept waiting for something to happen that was interesting. The movie was predictable. I watched it because I like Michelle Phieffer and Daniel Day Lewis.
2,DeWalt is Much Better,"To insert a bit into the Makita Ultralok, you have to pull the collar back and insert the bit--a two-handed operation. With the DeWalt Rapid Load, you just push the bit in as it is spring-loaded. I would give this 1 star, but most of the hex shank holders work the way the Makita does, and the Makita is of good quality."
2,Not to be taken too seriously,"The subtitle of this book gives you an idea of its tone - overdramatic to the point of silliness. It's hard to take Crawford and Gorman's points seriously amid references to straw men such as 'technojunkies,' 'enemies of the library' and 'suicidal librarians.' The authors do make some intriguing arguments to defend their sensible (if conservative) view of libraries of the future, though their style of writing makes them seem more reactionary than they actually are. I found aspects of this book interesting and useful, but it's far from the best book I've read on the subject."
1,"boring, pedantic, whiney, a waste of time and money","Crawford and Gorman. Gorman and Crawford. Two minds are usually better than one, but in this case, all that is amplified are biases and egos. Contrary to their self-inflated view of themselves, their whiney opinions have zero impact on library practices or the future of libraries.Sure sure, Crawford, for example, works for the RLG; and Gorman, well, Gorman is Gorman, so his opinions and thoughts must be worth paying attention to.Puhleeze....Gorman and Crawford. Crawford and Gorman. Kind of like Laurel and Hardy. Only not as intelligent, amusing, or insightful."
1,Forget it,"Unless you already know how to read electrical schematics, forget this book and find books that would teach you the very basics. This book had confused me more than help me decipher electrical schematics. I learned to read schematics by working on automobiles and comparing with the schematic in the service manuals.Electricity & electronics are not for everyone, but with proper books and proper instructor (this one is vital) you can at least learn enough to apply it to perform your job right the first time."
5,arjona,"i cosider Arjona as one of the best singer i have ever heard, i`m a truly fan of him and i hope he keep on doing such as great job as hi has always done it."
3,Renewed strength and hope,"Newbery Honor. Sad, sad, sad. Why do all Newbery Honor books have to be sad? An African American family lives in an apartment building. The mother works hard and doesn't make much money. The dad is always getting and losing jobs. The boy is handicapped and doesn't go to school. Next door is the jazz man who plays beautiful music, music that gives everyone renewed strength and hope."
2,weak for a Newbery,"First of all, the boy's disability was hardly worth mentioning. I have known three people (one of them my father) who had one leg shorter than the other since childhood and walked with distinct limps. Their limps never prevented them from doing anything they wanted to do. It seems highly unlikely that this boy would have been permitted to stay out of school.Second, the descriptions of the music didn't make me feel anything; they were just words. I've read writing that sounded like music, but this wasn't it.Third, there was no explanation for the parents' behavior, why they left, or why they returned. In real life, the boy would likely blame himself for their leaving.It has occurred to me that the last page and a half may be meant to take place in heaven after the boy has died of starvation."
2,Nice Camera - Very Fragile,"After less than 500 frames, received ""Lens Error,"" unable to correct without repair. Based on anticipated cost of repair versus current value, will likely throw camera away."
2,Lens Error,"This camera was great until I got the ""Lens Error"" message on my screen. Beware buyers - apparently a small drop of the camera or even a little dust in the lens is going to ruin it to the point where you may as well buy a new one. Repairs for this kind of error cost between $90 and $120 with shipping to boot. It's not worth it. Like I said, when it worked, it was wonderful (needs work on low-light shots, but overall not bad) and compact, but I've only had mine for a year and took care of it and I still get the pleasure of spending yet more money to buy a new one. Definitely not Nikon next time."
2,"Bad Picture quality, flash problems.","I bought this camera for my Mom when we went on the trip together. I'm glad I brought my own camera with me as otherwise we wouldn've have any good pictures. The picture quality was really bad, most of the pictures weren't clear. The outdoor pictures were ok, but indoor pictures were aweful in 80% of the cases. The camera is also quite slow to start and takes forever to charge the flash. We also could not set the flash to fire in the auto mode, it just would not fire. The instruction to the camera are very limited and unclear. I've used 6-7 different digital cameras before and this one is the worst I've ever used."
3,Not bad,"I enjoyed this, but not quite as much as other deLint works I have read. Part of what makes his work interesting to me is that it it introduces a little magic into our every day world. This novel however was all magical, from start to finish.The kindle edition is also marred by a bad scan job. Pretty much every chapter header was misspelled for example. Not just one or two, but all or nearly all. It shows a real lack of respect both for the reader and for the author and I rate it one star lower for this reason."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I'm a de Lint fan and love the familiar characters from his Newford universe but this book was a big disappointment. Finally, he tackles the long-twarted love of two well-known characters but he seems unable or unwilling to treat this narrative with the attention it deserves. Instead, he constructs a convoluted ""good v. evil,"" ""humanity hangs in the balance"" battle out of nothing -- a great deal of noise and nonsense to add drama to what should already be drama enough. It's just too much. Readers should go back to his earlier Newford novels when the human element of the story is not overshadowed by rampaging buffalo spirits."
5,another great one,As always Charles de Lint delivers an engrossing story with so many mythic undertones that you really feel that you are there. I have been reading his books for a very long time now and I have managed to introduce my duaghter to his books and she is as avid a fan as I am. Truely a writer worth reading and a genre that has grown immensely in the decades I have been reading this author.
5,another great from de Lint,"For Jilly Coppercorn fans, this finally satisfies the quandry over will she ever find love?. It is the ultimate sequel to The Onion Girl and I'm glad that Mr. de Lint finally got back to Jilly and Geordie. It is not to be read as a stand alone however, as to understand the story line one must read the Onion Girl first, otherwise reading this book would be a little confusing."
1,"Does the stuff, but","1. The 90 min recodring is NOT usable as the sound quality is tooo poor. It should have been advertized for only 22 or 33 min recording time.2. One way download, so onece you download and delete the file from the DW-90, cant get it back on the DW-90! Its a major setback if you do lot of recording and might want toreveiew while NOT with the PC. Guess its to protect the MP-3 players.3. The claimed directional MIC sensitivity is worse than human ears.4. As of Oct 22nd, 02 .The olympus website does not list the DW-90 driver /software any more! Surprise !!!Conclusion :Price wise its a bad buy , but compared to the basic analog recorders its stylish and kinda workable."
1,Misleading Package Information,"I purchased the Olympus DW-90 over other digital voice recorders because of its ability to download to a PC via USB cable. The package stated that it was compatible with, among other OS, Windows 98. When I attempted to install the included software, it would not install. Finally, in small print, the manual informed me that the software would not run on an OS that was upgraded from Windows 95. I emailed Olympus tech support and they confirmed that condition and informed me that the package provided that information, so that I could have made an informed purchase. Digging the package out of the trash to return the recorder, I looked it over carefully. No where does it inform the customer of the actual capability of the recorder. Now I question all the claims made for these things, particularly Olympus. The ...(website's)tech specs aren't any better."
2,Very Small Capacity,"I purchased this thinking that I was getting a recorder that would actually hold 90 minutes of audio. Unfortunately that capacity is only available for ""LP"" mode which is highly distorted. HQ and SP modes record very well, but only plan on getting 20-30 minutes of use out of it before the memory is full.The PC connection was not automatic, despite the instruction manual comments that no additional software was required. On the whole, I found no little to no support material available on the Olympus website.I returned the recorder and am still looking for something <$100 that provides 2-3 hours of high quality recording with a PC connection."
5,Much better than other D/s books!,"Definitely not boring for me (in response to the other customer review). Yes, there's a lot of the same TYPES of scenes, but with different twists to make them unique. I like the level of detail - emotional as well as physical. Eve Howard really knows from whence she comes. I devoured the book in about a day and re-read all the juicy bits a few more times! Can't wait to read the rest of the series - I started with this one, but although I didn't understand all of the ""background"" it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book (I mean the plot part, not the juicy bits... juicy bits stand on their own no matter what book it is!)."
2,No Tech Support,"This product would not connect to my computer. Tech support does not answer the phone (spent 6 hours on hold on speakerphone over three days trying to get through). They also do not return emails. Looks like a neat product, but that doesn't do you any good if it doesn't work, and they don't have a tech support department."
3,Healthy but little taste,I like these because of the good ingredients & how healthy they are. I don't buy them for the flavor though. The pumpkin seeds are about all the flavor I detect. These do not taste really sweet. They are a bit bland.
1,Gross.,"I had to double-check the expiration date: Yep, expires a year from now. Still, it smells and tastes like oil gone bad. There's soy. There's flax. There's something sweet. But it's all drowned out by the taste and smell of the bad oil. I opened two bars to be sure, and passed one to my coworker to smell. ""Yeah, gross,"" she said. ""I usually eat stale stuff, but I wouldn't eat that!""Although I purchased this exact product locally, I did not buy it from this retailer.I'm surprised and disappointed - their pumpkin granola cereal is my favorite cereal!I much prefer Cascadian Farm's crunchy pumpkin granola bars, but they're hard to find. Kashi's are good if you don't have a wheat or a gluten allergy."
3,Smells somewhat stale,"This granola bar product's name contains several sensuous operative words: organic, pumpkin and flax plus; therefore, the bars should smell and taste great. However, the bars smell somewhat stale, and they taste at about a C- (if we were using a grading system). I am disappointed. And I'm stuck with five more unopened boxes, which I'm going to donate to the poor. I know that they're nutritional, but I shouldn't have to bite the bullet to eat each granola bar. My guess that they're not stale at all--they just have an unpleasant smell."
3,Not As Good as the Cereal,"We love Nature's Path cereals and especially this one. But, we were very disappointed that the granola bars are not as good as the cereal is!"
2,Bland!,I bought 2 boxes of these in the store and was really disappointed in the lack of pumpkin or spice flavor! I thought they were really bland. My son wouldn't even eat them. They are also very sugary and sticky!
5,I love these bars!,"These are delicious and healthy granola bars, and are perfect to grab on the way out the door. They travel well, and keep for a long time (but they don't last long in my house!). They are chewy when fresh, but even left out in a freezing car, taste good crunchy. I can't live without them!"
3,From Wonderful to WTF?!?,Great gun at first. Good weight and blow back feature was impressive. Shot relatively straight and true. Bumped it on a door frame while walking outside and suddenly the gears for the blowback just spun when you pulled the trigger (you can see them through the clear sides) and gun would know longer fire. Got about 3 days use out of it.
1,A Bad Myth being Perpetuated...,"Although a c-section maybe necessary for emergencies, most aren't. Only 10-20% of births should be via c-section, and only when medically necessary. C-sections are not a normal birth method, only a vaginal birth is. If you want to read a more informative look at c-sections and the dangers, read ""Born in the USA"" by Marsden Wagner, also an MD."
5,Godot Is Good,"This is Beckett's best play and for good reason. ""Waiting for Godot"" or ""Waiting for God,"" as I see, is a simple play about waiting. That's all that's it's really about -- waiting. Well, I guess you can say there is something there about abuse and oppression and rudeness and poverty, but it is mostly about waiting. Some say they are waiting for the return of God. Something some say will go on forever. Lucky and Pozzi add another dimension to the play. They are barbaric and rude and violent, while the two main characters wait and wait for God to return. I have to disagree with anyone who says nothing happens in the play. Oh, something happens all right, it just doesn't seem to mean anything to the main theme of the play -- waiting."
4,Existentialism served raw!,"After reading The Stranger by Camus, I did not think that existentialism could be more plainly defined in prose, but Godot has left me debating (and yes, also waiting). Beckett, it seems, is also magically able to actualize ennui as a comedy -- as he puts it, a tragicomedy. But moreover, the piece does well to capture a subtlety of the existential mood: man's inextinguishable, incorrigible hope."
1,Super late,"Book has not been received yet. Was supposed to arrive 8 days ago, expected to have it as a three kings day present for my daughter. Didnt make it on time. I am still waiting for it."
4,My Interpretation,"I think this book is really a Civil War story. The characters in the story reveal it. There is a grant, lee, and a slave, and i think the story fits. I was so convinced that I wrote a paper over for my college professor in theater history."
1,I am still Waiting For Godot.,"Waiting for Godot is a snail moving story about two men who sit around fighting, and trying on a boot that doesn't fit all while waiting for a guy who never comes. This story was repiticious in the most borring way. There might have been a lesson this story, but it is hard to hear under the loud constant shouts of ""BED TIME STORY."""
4,A strangely engrossing nothingness,"While I'd heard of this play before, this was my first experience reading it. A play wherein nothing really happens; however, I was totally absorbed. For its lack of ""happenings"" there is great dialogue between Estragon and Vladimir. Layers upon layers of symbolism, and symbolism that about any reader could construe differently depending on the mindset, experience and perception of each respective reader. Worthy of its acclaim, I think."
5,A question to the potential reader:,"What is your perception of the VOID ? The vacuum ? If you ever had the chance to feel the absolute void, the true nothingness, would you consider it to be beautifull ? Would you consider it to be God ? Or would you be scared and turn away ? To get a feeling of what other people felt just read the previous reviews. Some of them thought it was majestic, some of them thought it was God and some of them fled away, scared, and because they got scared they thought that it was something ugly.Since we do not have the chance to perceive the real void because the natural law forbids it, the closest thing available is Waiting for Godot. The words are misleading. There should be no words, but Becket had no other choice in the material world that we live. So if you are curious to see in what category you belong just read it.As for me, I thought it was beautifull. One of the most beautifull things I have ever experienced...."
2,Waiting for Godot,"I know this is one of those works that are supposed to be masterpieces, but it did absolutely nothing for me. To be fair, I'm not a theater person, and I never got the appeal of absurdist works or anything else along those lines. I got about a third of the way into this and just couldn't stand to read it anymore, it drove me nuts. If you can appreciate that kind of stuff then I guess I can see why so many people love it, I'm just not one of them."
5,Waiting for some of these others to get over themselves,"Waiting for Godot is--hands down--the best and most important play of the 20th Century. It defines 20th C humanity, not through overly complex themes, layering, etc., but rather through a simple dramatic illustration. Remember that Beckett chose to write it in French first, because he did not have as great a grasp of French as he did of English. He wanted it to be simple.One of its first very appreciative audiences consisted of prison inmates--not generally regarded as high-literary types.This play is funny and sad and beautiful and theatrical and human and simple.Sure ""Godot"" could mean ""God."" Now define ""God.""If you haven't the chance to see a live production, you must read this book!"
3,Very Odd play...,I was required to purchase this play for a Theatre class. Personally I don't care for the script. I feel like it is a bit hard to follow and unsatisfying.The vender has been wonderful! Thanks!J. Hickling
1,Tragicomedy that lies only without,"Some can and, indeed, many have swum chin-deep in their deconstructionist farm offal analyzing works from the great literary canon of the West. No need to do that in this instance. First, WFG is hardly susceptible of analysis under any critical theory. Second, it's not a literary work (hence the result cited in the preceding sentence). The perfect inability on the part of people who should know better to say the ""Emperor has no clothes"" is the only tragicomedy associated with this tiresome nonsense."
2,What's it all about,"What conclusions can one draw from Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot? IS it that friends stick together in any stiuation? Is it that time passes but nothing really happens? Is it that we're all waiting for someone, that we call Godot that we'd like to have come and make everything right? All of the above"
2,Prepare to be frustrated...,"Waiting For Godot is a classic. I know it's really shaped how modern plays. But wow... this play is frustrating. It has it's moments, but for a majority the play you just want to bang Didi and Gogo's heads against one another. When I was reading this I couldn't help but wonder what people saw in it. I really had to struggle to get through it. If I hadn't been required to read it for my drama class, I would have tossed it out my 3rd-floor apartment window. Do read it if like me, you're interested in writing plays. But if you're just reading it because a friend was raving how good it was, give it a miss. They're probably just ""being"" pretentious drama majors who couldn't tell art from a scribble done by a two-year old."
1,Smashed books are not fun to read. Content is classical - a masterpiece.,I suppose I received value for the money. This appears to be the same edition I studied in French class at Columbia oh so many years ago.
1,Absurdism at its best; literature at its worst.,"I'll say this very simply: If you are interested in existentialism, philosophy in general, or the theater of the absurd, read this book. If you are looking for a book with any plot or deeper meaning, look elsewhere. If you choose to read this, a word of warning: though it is a short book, it is the opposite of a page-turner. You can barely finish a page before you have to put the book down and think about something else. Also, it will most likely depress you."
1,Not a good play,"Waiting for Godot was not a good play at all. I read it for school, but would never read this sort of play. It was about two guys and their relationship over the years and the people they meet along the way. They always have to be doing something to occupy their time. If they don't find anything to do they alway end up saying they want to kill themselves. It was the worst play I ever read. I will not give away the ending but it was about nothing! Don't bother reading."
5,"A response to ""A reader in Michigan""","In your one star review, you actually understood Beckett's genius, despite your trepidation for it. The play takes place in two days that practically mirror each other. The idea of the days being practically the same is to show a human existence at its most basic level where each day mirrors the next, making human beings' struggles on earth completely meaningless. For instance, each day you wake up, eat breakfast, go to work, come home, go to bed, and then repeat the cycle the next day with slight deviations in your routine. Look at the three page monologue of Lucky where he points out that ""man in brief...wastes and pines waste and pines..."" To me this completes the theme of the play that man is born then he will one day die. In between, he wastes away at meaningless tasks. Beckett's straight forward stripped down look of existence makes me shiver with the truth it contains. This is truly a masterpiece of our time."
5,One of the Best,"""Nobody comes, nobody goes, its awful!"" A true reflextion of life. One of the best from the theatre of the absurd. It turns into the vocabulary for every day thought."
4,Powerfully Absurd,"This play is completely absurd and that is the powerful point that the writer is trying to make about existence and all that comes with it.highly recommended for those who are interested in Philosophy, theater and the non traditional."
3,Sleepy little classic,"This classic of the absurd tragicomedy must be given its due respect though I have to admit, I found it a bit of a sleep-inducer. The story follows a conversation about a character wasting his time awaiting the arrival of his friend. The friend, it seems, is never going to arrive and so the plot is really a roller-coaster ride of emotions from excited anticipation to boredom to utter hopelessness and dispair. But, sadly, its an anti-climactic end with nothing - which is, in essence, the message of the play. Read it for it's historical and social significance but do not expect more than what it can give. Risking negative votes on my review I have to add, at least it is short and Beckett does not make the mistake of attempting to belabor a very tired point."
4,Learning to Accept the Insanity,"Waiting for Godot, a play about two men who cannot communicate and always wait for something that never comes, attempts to show us the futility of waiting for that phantom message or meaning humanity is obsessed with--it is a call to action. This play is packed with nonsensical dialogue. The plot does not exsist. Yet, once we realized that Waiting for Godot is a parody of human existance it starts to make sense--at least in subtle ways. Much of the play cannot be interpreted in any finality, but, that is what has kept this play alive throughout the twentieth century. It's enigmatic, a puzzle of words, poetry, and philosophy. I recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. The play is short and does not take too much commitment. Take a quiet evening and give it a shot. What are you waiting for?"
3,Utterly Depressing Theme,"Unless you'd fancy the rest of your lifetime (or do I exaggerate) brooding over the futility of living, the meaninglessness of life - it would be wise to keep away from Beckett's plays. Reasoning powers are intensely inbued in this novel, which is why it can be a strong anti-living, anti-Christ, anti-all that life and living should be about. Life is all about hopes and dreams, and Beckett's deceptively simple & comic play wittingly or unwittingly creates a dark perspective that offers no hope for reprieval. The poignancy of its theme is doubtless - and because it is not possible to appreciate Beckett's incredible talents without not being convinced by his phililophy of life, one wonders how one can go on living the next day. The author's words cuts like a knife in exacting existence itself, when life should not be defined in the realm of our own reasonings."
2,Waiting For Boredom(Godot),"To be frankly honest I have now read this book 4 times, I don't know exactly why I did so but I did and I am still confused. If you feel that you should get the book that a lot of critics call ""the most important play of the 20th century"" then while you're at it pick up a coles notes style book for it. But don't pay much for the interpretation book since the one I bought summed up the entire play in one paragraph that took up half a page. And I agree with one critic who described the two act play in one sentence ""nothing happens...twice"" Unless you have to buy this book for school or you're a large fan of plays then don't bother doing more than looking at the pretty cover art"
5,a modernist masterpiece,"Like all great works of literature, this can only be enjoyed with repeated reading. The performative nature of Beckett's art insists on SHOWING one what boredom is rather than telling one about it. The lack of definite structure and the seemingly rambling dialogue is Beckett's way of expressing the uncertainty and loss of order in the modern world. Yet the play is peppered with little stabs of lyric and sheer poetry. Despite our futile existence, we are sometimes capable of the great and good. The wait for Godot is a remark on just how much faith we place on a thread of hope and how much we need/depend on it. In uncertainty, there is only hope to cling to. The beauty of the play lies not in its easy accessibility, but in its powerful reflection on human nature and life. One of the best of the twentieth century plays i've read."
3,"Just like Napoleon Dynamite, you should experience it even if its really boring.","I didn't enjoy reading this play. I thought that once the Beckett had gotten me aware of the pointlessness of the characters and their situation and then hammered it into me 20 times to make me feel and empathize with them, he should of moved on. However, he doesn't and keeps uselessly hammering till the reader gets frustrated with the characters. He intends to create boredom and meaningless and gets anger and disgust. The character of Pozzo and lucky are especially trite cut outs of the bourgeious owner and his proletariat vassal. There are a couple of funny and witty moments, but that's all. Having said that, just like Napoleon Dynamite, the sheer audacity and uniqueness of this play makes it a worthwhile read. You will find yourself thinking of it afterwards (which is fun), but bored while reading it (which sucks). That's my 2 cents. Thanks for reading."
1,The king has no clothes!,"I read thru the glowing reviews of other readers and all I could think of was that Hans Christian Anderson fable in which all the kings subjects heaped praise on his clothes when in fact he was naked. This play is just plain awful. Because there is so little there, it leaves ample spaces for people with vivid imaginations to fill in all manner of meaning. I have read several examples from the ""Theater of the Absurd"" genre and many were at least witty such as Ionesco's Rhinoceros.This play was neither amusing nor interesting - just tedious."
1,Nonsense,I read this book for my lit class and I found it nonsense. This play is so dumb and pointless. It is the biggest disappointment in my class. I suggest that no one wastes time on this nonsense.
4,"Good book, but a word of caution","I really enjoyed the story in this book, the art sets the scene for a vampire novel with a cute twist. The characters are three dimentional. The plot is an interesting spin on the vampire story.I was pretty confused when I started reading, it seemed like there was part of the story I wasn't getting. I read the whole thing ( I enjoyed it once I picked up the thread of the story), but it turns out my copy was volume 3 with the volume 1 binding. I took a closer look at the title page and it does say Vol. 3. My mistake. I did not get this book from Amazon and I don't know how many copies are like this. I will definitely check it out when I go to the book store again."
1,Ridiculous,"Popular with New Age Pagans and Wiccans. She teaches you to find your power animal and advocates crystal healing and speaking to guardian angels. She claims to be able to teach readers to analyze auras from touch. Readers are taught how to make their own Medicine Bundles and are told how to determine to whom they can show the bundles. Most of the book is pure Nuage, but Christianity is included as well. The author states that if you come across road kill, it was meant for you to find."
5,Great Product!,"I've had this product for a while it has been nothing but greatness! i needed it for my netbook and it has preformed wonderfully. The only problem was when i first plugged it into my usb port and i pushed the button to open it, it didn't open up right away and i thought it was broken but really my computer was just recognizing the new equipment and wouldn't allow it to open until it was scanned and all that jazz. In all this is a great product i have watch countless dvd's and stripped many cd's with it. This is a wonderful product!!!"
3,Not compatible with Windows 7,"This is a nice external drive and works well with Windows XP or Vista. However, it does NOT work with Windows 7. If you have a computer using Windows 7 or if you plan to upgrade to Windows 7 then this is not the drive for you."
1,Useless,"This drive has very few pros and cons. For a positive aspect, it is small and light. For a negative aspect... it doesn't work. At least not for me. It was able to read four or five CDs, but nothing since. I've tried at least another dozen, and there's always an error message saying Windows can't read from the disc, or that there IS no CD in the drive. Same with DVDs many times. It's unreliable and usually doesn't work at all. I could probably return it, but I've already ordered another model that will (hopefully) actually do what it's supposed to."
3,CD works but not DVD,For some reason it does not play DVDs. Buy if only you are looking to use as a CD player on your computer.
3,Its NOT writing to DVD-R Format,"Writing to CD-R works Fine.Reading from DVD-R is FineBUT when i tried to Write to an DVD-R format disc, it says that the disc is write procected, and ask to insert DVD-RW.Does this mean we cannot use this prodct for Writing to a DVD-R ??I called the support, they were not able to confrim this."
1,Targus DVD/CD-ROM EXT Drive,Does not come with its own power supply. Can not rely on power from CPU.If you order ext power supply be sure to specify PADVD010U only. Can not rate product properly without correct power cable.
2,Too Bad It Doesn't Play DVDs,"As a CD RW, it's fine, probably 4 stars. But like a fool, I read the reviews and two of the highest ratings came from people who that they were replacing DVD drives with this Targus CD-ROM.One implied that he has watched movies while on plane trips. If so, it wasn't a video that he'd bought. I inferred that. Another said that his laptop DVD went out on him, and he replaced it with this. Again, I inferred that he could also use it for watching DVDs.Now I'll return this, and take my lumps because I'm not spending more than $83 to watch a DVD and all my CD drives work just fine."
1,Targus USB CD-Rom Player,Do not waste your money on this. I purchased it to use with my Cortex Digital Controller and it will not work. Very flimsy tray also.
3,my review,"ASUS Eee PC 900HA 8.9-Inch Netbook (1.6 GHz Intel ATOM N270 Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, XP Home) Black"
3,would like to give it 5 stars,"the description does not say that it is incomplete and that you need to purchase the cross bar separately. In fact, the description says it is ready to go. But when you get it, there is no cross bar and the picture on the box does not have the cross bar. would have been nice to know at time of purchase. Other than that, it works as advertised."
4,yakima drydock canoe hitch carrier,I purchased this item in early spring and am overall pleased. When you have the straps connected it is relatively secure. The only thing frustrating about the product is it does not come with the top bar... I purchased it at a local truck store for roughly $50-$75.. There is a little sway forward and backward when I am loading or removing my canoe.
5,I grew up with this cookbook,"My father was a publisher's rep for Doubleday while I was growing up, and the go-to cookbook in our house was the Doubleday Cookbook. We never had Joy of Cooking, or any of the other classics, just Doubleday. I got interested in cooking in my teens and read the book cover to cover. Most all of what I know about cooking today came from this book, and cooking is my primary hobby. The original had fun things like how to skin and cook a squirrel, or kill and dismember a turtle, but I don't know that the most recent ones have that. I still have the old, stained, falling apart Doubleday cookbook from my youth, and it is one of my treasures."
5,Great 60's all girl high school romantic semi-psychedelic garage-pop band,"Imaginative, sensitively written and performed, with just enough teen angst.The first half (tracks 1-11) are the originally released tracks with a few session musicians mixed in, the second half are the previously unreleased studio demos of many of the same songs with just the girls on instruments, which I actually prefer, although the studio mixes are also very well done. Excellent vocals, and electric guitar, bass, organ, and drums played by the band members themselves. Exceptionally good songwriting."
2,Good Story,"This true story was good, though it took me a while to get though the book as it was quite boring in some parts. Towards the end it got alot more intersesting."
2,"Look great, but tight","These boots look great, but they were too tight for my calves, and I'm not a big girl."
4,This is not Barbara's style,"This book is not the style of Barbara, it doesn't compare the past with the present, it is a detectives story but is an easy reading book."
5,These things look great,"The pictures a pretty accurate. Just look a the dimensions on the page and you will know how big they are, because that will be the most important thing. If you want a really big lamp, this isn't it. These are average size lamps. The lamps look modern and classy, but aren't too crazy. The materials all seem high quality. They are the type of lamp that you can probably look at in 30 years and still not worry about them looking stupid. I've had them for a year now and they are running and looking great."
3,"looks nice, the pull-chain is clunky",The lamp looks nice and comes with energy saving bulbs which was great. The on/off pull chains are a bit clunky and don't operate smoothly. You have to give them a good yank.
1,wtf is this,"first d4l, franchise girls, ying yang crackheads now this chicken noodle soup was awful qwhat kind of crack are these fools on."
1,Millenium Buckdancing,"Another wack dance record named after another wack dance. What more can I say besides this song bit elements of another stupid dance record named after a stupid dance called Peanut Butter and Jelly. Samples/Peanut Butter Jelly with a baseball bat/Chicken noodle:/chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side\(how can nobody catch that?). The beat is plain, Young B is Lil ChowChow wack and the dude on the adlibs sounds like he is doing his worst DJ Kool impression. This cant be the same New York that criticizes every other region for not being hip hop? What so hip hop about silly dance that was probably created by a tulip(like the Harlem shake was)? This wouldnt be the first time up north bit from the south. Remember Black Rob's Whoa being a wannabe of Juvenile's Ha. Shame on you New York, SHAME ON YOU!!!! Chicken doodoo soup with some[...]on the side."
3,too bad,"i really, really wanted to like this album. but the vocals, to my ear, sound more nasal than twangy. as i listened, no song leapt out at me - rather, i found myself continually losing interest in it, as the whole album never really varied, never rose or fell, never went anywhere. once it was over, i had no desire to hear it again. i suppose i mean that i found it boring. i'm sad to say this, because their sound has potential, but this album was neither exciting enough, gloomy enough, or atmospheric enough to keep my attention."
1,much ado about zilch!,"This book was recommended to me as the work of a very great thinker. Having read and re-read it several times I remain distinctly unimpressed. The thesis of the book appears to be that any society, once the most elementry necessities are overcome, inevitably creates a surplus (of time, energy, resources). Soceties differ and are distinguished from one another by how they spend/use this surplus. The productive capacity is not infinite and must inevitably result in ""un-productive consumption"".Where is the profoundidty?"
3,Could you ship in plastic bag?,"Nice product but is shipped in a box with no plastic bag. Therefore, arrives smudged which is not nice as it was a gift."
3,Item not received,"The Dyad 4 may be a wonderful shoe, but I certainly don't know a thing about it. You see, my order was lost in transit by DHL. It wasn't replaced and reshipped by Amazon because they ran out of my size. It's too bad that the shoes were lost because they probably could have told a wonderful tale -- being shipped to Missoula, Montana, where they were refused delivery and last tracked to Chehalis, Washington, rather than Portland, Oregon where they were supposed to arrive. Alas, I really wanted those pair of Dyad 4s. Maybe one of you will buy me a pair for Christmas (size 10.5 D). I would be sooooo grateful."
3,So-So,"I liked this book but it wasnt as good as some of the other ""Love Stories"" I've read. When Lucas' car is hit by the new girl, Julia, he imedialty has something against her. And when Austin and Julia fall in love it's the last straw. Lucas begins to start some nasty rumors about Julia, partly because he feels he's losing his best friend. read the book if u want to find out want happens to Julia and Austin."
3,Not the best version,"This translation is hard to follow. I would recommend getting the other bite-sized versions, which are much clearer than this version. Look up ""PLutarch's Lives, Volume I""."
2,Good bedside reading,For those insomniacs out there this book will certainly do the trick. Or it makes a good paper weight or door stop.
5,Motivates math understanding,"The computer game version of The Number Devil closely follows the book, as kids progress through sections on prime numbers, the Fibonacci series, Pascal's triangle, and an infinite series approaching one. Nine of the ten games worked well for us, but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth, the arrow game. We understood the math, but couldn't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows. This was disappointing, because we could never reach the bonus section. All in all, though, this is a good investment for a child, 8 or up, who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers."
1,Don't waste time for Mac!,"This doesn't work on a Mac, and Amazon shouldn't sell it as if it does. We ordered it for a C'mas gift for our son who LOVES the book. A big disappointment!"
5,Excellent story establishing the foundations of her Galactic Milieu novels,"Julian May has created a compelling story with character I found to be engaging and about whose struggles I found it easy to care. Her device of using the Uncle Rogi character as the narrator / catalyst worked well for me, giving the story a relatively normal (non-meta) perspective.I found this to be an excellent read in its own right, and a fitting contemporary genesis for the Milieu and Exiles trilogies. The only downside? - Needs cooler aliens!"
2,Not what I expected,"These flashcards are not what I expected. I had previously purchased the My First Touch & Feel Picture Cards: First Words (Touch & Feel) by DK Publishing and loved them so much that I thought I'd try to find more ""first words"" flashcards containing different pictures. These are no where near in quality - the cards are very thin and flimsy and the pictures are not as vibrant and appealing. I would NOT recommend these flashcards. Try the ones mentioned in my review... these are MUCH nicer!"
3,A Wonderful Guide to Clematis,"The first thing that stands out when you read this book is the great photography and excellent illustrations. Raymond J. Evison guides you through the wonderful world of Clematis by teaching you all there is to know about this beautiful plant. You will learn the history, classification, the different species, and much more.As Evison states, this book isn't a monograph of the species, but a guide for the gardener. So, it has just enough background information so that the gardener has a good foundation. Even I got a bit lost in the groups section, but it becomes clearer as you get more into the book. I would have liked to see some shots about propagation, planting, training, and pruning, especially in a growing guide, but overall the descriptions and the book as a whole is great.This is not a book for the complete novice, but for the intermediate to advanced gardener."
3,Not up to par,"Considering how good the third movie was, I was considerably disappointed with this one. The storyline left something to be desired, and the movie just didn't flow well. When considering the three other movies, Swords of an Honorable Ruler is the best, but the other two are also better than the fourth one."
3,"Fell a bit Short, but still Worth a View","This movie was truly a side story, having nothing to do with the chase to track down the jewel. It goes a bit more into Inuyasha's and Kikyou's past, but nothing that is relevant to the overall series. It was a decent enough story overall, but i felt like the plot was being based on facts they were just pulling out of their [...] in order to fill an hour. The animation itself was up to the level as the same 3 movies before it. Music good. Overall, if ya wanna see a good inuyasha movie, i'd stick with movie 3 that they made."
4,An attempt at a family movie perphaps......,"I have purchased the previous three InuYasha movies and find this one lacking in depth. While yes the anime series has ended a little too soon for viewers in America this movie seems a bit toned down, no intensity from any of the characters, no conflict between Sesshomaru and InuYasha, and no meeting between Kikyo and Kagome in what is otherwise an alright movie. Perhaps the producers and author of the series were trying to appeal to a larger audience and this version of InuYasha is lacking in passion, intensity, and connectedness to the main story in that InuYasha's time on Horai Island is never really explored in any kind of real depth. Now that I've torn this movie down I will say that if you don't care about any of the theme's I've mentioned then this movie is just fine."
4,"Not my favorite out of the Inuyasha movies, but","it was still worth watching. I've only seen the original movie (not the english voice over since that doesn't come out until 8/1/2006) There's not enough Sesshomaru in my opinion and there is a lot about Inuyasha and Kikyo's past, but the story itself is really well done. The 3rd movie's my favorite, but that's because of Sesshomaru's storyline. (in my opinion only of course) I like that it doesn't have Naraku. That's always a plus! lol."
4,A Good Deed,"This movie most definitely does not fall under the typical Inuyasha movies that one has encountered so far. This plot line ties in all stories including Sesshomaru's to this Mystic Island. The plot line is very detailed and concise, must be an avid Inuyasha fan to fully follow the movie.But like all the Inuyasha cliches' this still has the typical doomsday plot with out hero Inuyasha not only saving human-kind and the world, but a few more half-demons along with them. Great movie, excellent soundtrack and orchestration with the same old loveable characters!A must see for any Inuyasha fan!"
1,don't bother,if you like the first three and the show stop there it is not worth it rent it if you have to see it it is not worth the time and the money
4,Not breaking new ground,"Fire on the Mystic Island is like the filler episode of the movie series. It's fun, it's pretty, it's got some great fights and some good dialogue and character interaction, but you don't really learn anything about the characters or the world of the series that you didn't already know. While I was watching it, I didn't get the feeling at any point that I was watching a movie. It felt just like a really long episode of the anime. If all that is what you're looking for, then you're in luck. If not, you probably won't enjoy it as much as the other three movies."
3,Not what I had expected,"I watched this in Japanese about six months ago. I wish there had been more development of Inuyasha and Kagome's relationship. It seems they become closer (don't want to spoil it) in the 2nd movie, then never mention it or hint at it ever again..in the remaining movies or the series. Then again, I'm a girl and feed off of that type of stuff. But, as a devoted Inuyasha fan, I was kind of let down. I hope they make another one."
5,My Little Secret,"No other deep conditioner does what this one does. After using it, my hair feels silky and soft but not weighed down like most deep conditioners seem to do to my fine, straight hair. I almost hate to give this a good review because apparently it's no longer being made and I want to save what's left for myself!"
5,Wonderful!,"I have been using this product for more than 4 years, it is excellent! Perfect for colored hair, leaves your hair smooth and smell so good. Love this product I highly recommended."
5,hair product,this is a wonderful deep conditioner. I use it every two weeks. If you have highly damaged hair it is very helpful once a week.
3,Good product - bad delivery,"This hair product works great! I've never been disappointed. It makes my hair soft with a great shine without being oily. However, the container it arrived in was smashed in several pieces. I'm having to scrape the product off of the plastic wrap it came in and transfer it to another container. Disappointing for sure. I will buy the product again but not from this vender."
2,Caveat Emptor Drummers...,"It's fun to watch Bill Stewart's approach and to have it on DVD, but the kick drum mic must have been turned off. Perhaps Peter Bernstein stepped on the wire, and the sound engineer failed to notice. You can't hear the brother's kick AT ALL, except for when he solos, and even then faintly.And I played this through a surround sound system with a sub woofer, and tried to ""mix"" with the sub/center/surround countrols. Cranking the sub woofer just gave more organ bass, and Stewart's kick, although tuned high, is below 1k hertz or so that would be considered mid range, so there was no way to affect that either.-SeanSeattle"
5,Inspiring and Insightful,"This is one of the best books I've ever read -- on Zen, Buddhism or Spirituality in general. Hongzhi was obviously as clear as they get, and his subtle and powerful language and insight is an inspiration to any practicioner, from any tradition. This book is a must read for anyone who seeks a deeper understanding of Reality."
4,Finding the invisible colors,"Journey with translator Taigen Daniel Leighton (with the assistance of Yi Wu), as he explores a collection of thoughts from the mind of a brilliant 12th century philosopher, Zen Master Hongzhi. Clearly this is a labor of love, from many perspectives. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book as a first foray into eastern philosophy, but it is wonderful to see how rich the lives of humans can be, even when they lived 800 years ago. And how rich your own life could be."
4,Compared to Pat Conroy.....,"Everyone is comparing Carter Coleman to Pat Conroy. While I can't agree with that wholeheartedly, there was a certain familiar feel to this novel. Maybe more of an old school Wally Lamb....The quirks and dysfunctions of this Southern family were unique and interesting. Every family member has a voice in this book, with a seamless transition from one character to the next. It did take me a bit longer than usual to become engrossed in the story, but as soon as I did I was hooked. I found myself telling this tale to others and think it would make a wonderful book for a group discussion."
5,Written With Refreshing Honesty Not Often Found in Novels,"Imagine an event occurring in your family that forces such all-encompassing change that it sends at least one of your siblings headlong into oblivion. Good kids don't end up that way, right?Cage Rutledge, the eldest of three brothers, was popular, academic and athletic. For this reason, it is unthinkable that he should set out on a destructive, guilt-soaked odyssey that tests his family's love and the bonds that hold them together.Each member, in his or her own way, takes the action that seems most appropriate. Their choices are as unexpected as they are endearing.Cage's Bend is written with the kind of refreshing honesty not often found in popular novels. The narrative, at any place in the book, entices the reader to venture forward to find out what happens to the Rutledge family.You will smile and cry and come to care about these characters. This book is worth the read."
4,Warm and inspiring!,"This is a painful, yet at the same time, joyful ride through a family's turmoil of having a mentally-ill son. Coleman really invites you to know the characters and how they tick. A reflective journey that will inspire you to think about just how good life is and what it has to offer. A truly enjoyable experience that I recommend to anyone who needs a reminder of how the simple things in life matter so much."
2,REAL SPRING BREAK HOTTIES IN THAILAND,"My boyz and I were totally sold on GGW until I picked up the ""Wild Girls Thailand"" DVD. Talk about HOT Asian chicks in bikinis on the beach! You gotta check it out!"
4,Well done,"The subject matter, a farm wife accused of murdering her husband with an axe, is not in itself terribly interesting to a jaded gal like me. But the author did a great job of researching the newspaper and court records of the day (early 20th century). In those days, women in her socio-economic class were absolutely trapped in bad domestic situations. Mr. Wolf deftly takes us through the chronology to the resolution."
3,Interesting read,Still no one knows who did it.It will always be an unsolved crime.but from the beginning this book held my interest.
2,Midnight assassin: A Murder in America's Heartland,Not my style in a book. It didn't hold my interest. Kept repeating itself over and over. Not a good quality in a book.
3,drug out a few times,could have moved the story along a little faster.... more details on the children's response....more on sheriff's wife take of
2,Wordy purchase,I purchased this book because it was supposed to be a mystery. I found it to be wordy and very boring. I literally skimmed through the last half just to finish it! The useless descriptions of painted walls etc. I really finely didn't care if the wife was guilty or not.
3,"OK, but too long","It was interesting, but too much time spent on uninteresting details. Some of it seemed repetitive. It isn't a must read to me."
3,Just the trial and nothing added.,Just the facts and nothing more. It was obvious the wife murdered her husband. It was interesting the contrast between how the murder scene was handled then compared to the extra caution taken today.
3,book review,it isn't bad just goes on and on from too many different view points. Interesting read for the most part.
3,Midnight Assassin: A Murder in America's Heartland Midnight,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY BORING REPEATING, REPEATING AND REPEATING. WRITTEN WITHOUT ANY SUSPENSE. REALLY BORING AND HARD TO READ. KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING..ANYTHING."
4,Does domestic abuse justify murder?,"This true crime account synthesizes available sources to provide a picture of a man's murder and the ambiguities surrounding the conviction of his allegedly abused wife. Early feminist author Susan Glaspell based a one-act drama ""Trifles"" on the case in which her sympathy for abused women overrode the issue: Was justice done? Personally, I am troubled by the interpretation Ms. Glaspell made of the case, but this book challenges readers to make thoughtful responses to the issues it raises. A worthwhile read."
4,Based on a True Story,"I love how this book is based on a true story, and if you look any one thing up out of it, you can find actual information on it! I bought this book expecting a story, turns out its real! It was a pretty good book all in all."
3,Well written account of farm life in the mid-west,The authors do an excellent job of capturing the feel of the times. I only gave the book 3 stars because I found the follow-up to the lives of the family members a bit lacking.
4,Fast read but a bit unbelievable,"I read this book and it was a fast read, but some of it was too far fetched to believe."
4,Good read..,"My wife is from Iowa (we live in MA). Purchased based on this, other reviews, and the reasonable price. The narrative flows well, good retelling of the events in context of that time. Life was tough on the farm at the turn of the century. Given the many conveniences of modern life this is easy to forget.The author provides a tease at the beginning, but best I could tell never answered the question about why folks now were concerned with the author writing this book. Why was there concern with speculating about the ""real killer"" a few generations removed. Maybe the answer was implied, but it would have been neat to hear from the current generation. Otherwise a very good read."
4,Interesting Story But Too Much Filler,"This is a really good and interesting story. It's a turn of the 20th century murder mystery. There are parts of this book that are very compelling but there is simply too much filler. I don't understand why some writers draw out books instead of letting them flow naturally and end when they need to end even if that makes them shorter than they want. Why at the end are we told useless information about a reporter that covered the story. Who she married, what she did with her life and so on. Who cares? All through the book the pace is slow.However, having said that if you pick the right places to skim the filler this can be quite a compelling true crime story. Recommended."
3,Not Bad,It felt drawn out. The story could have been told in half the number of pages. I would not recommend.
2,Subject doesn't sustain the Narrative,"Annoyingly repetitive. The problem, for me, is that there really is no mystery here. To inflate the narrative to book length, the author resorts to repetition and digressions that are marginally or not at all relevant to his subject."
3,Review,Slow reading. It was hard to get through the book. Not one of the better books. I enjoy books that keep you on the edge of your seat but this was not one of them.
4,Midnight Assasin,"Good story, thought that a lot of research went into it, too bad we were not able to know if the wife had really killed the husband."
3,Long,It was informative but extremely drawn out. I loved the first couple of chapters but became disinterested after the first half of the book.
4,Interesting Read,This book was well written and the subject matter compelling. The author(s) aptly wove together the story of an intriguing true crime with accounts of farm life and commentary on the role of women at that time. It was an easy and engrossing read!
5,Great Mystery with thought provoking insights,"This book is a great read; hard to put down. It is well written, and provides many thought provoking insights."
2,Writing Style,I did not care for the style of writing. More like a report or essay. I could not get involved with the characters.
2,Ok,But not a page turner that's for sure... a little insight into a woman's world at the turn of the century... but not any big revolutions are revealed here... just boring... really boring...
3,Interesting read,"I thought this book was interesting if incomplete. The story of a murder in a family held a lot of intrigue. However, the author jumps around too much for my liking and there is not a lot of continuity."
3,Expected something different,"I have to applaud the two writers who did a great deal of research to tell this story and they told it well. I did learn how far we've come in our legal process and abilities. Therefore, I think the story was worth telling and reading. I'm so used to ""glamorized,"" and charged up stories that this one seemed a little flat. But, I still think it was good."
5,Kaiju Manna from Heaven,STARMAN Vols. 1 and 2 offer four heretofore frustratingly rare films with lots of extras and the customary Something Weird quality (though don't expect the prints to look as though they'd been released yesterday). All fans of Japanese psychotronica NEED these two DVDs...nothing more need be said.
3,Nostalgia,"I remember watching these movies between episodes of Ultraman and early Saturday morning Godzilla matinees. While the action is campy, and the plots are strange, it is a wonderful romp into early Japanese science-fiction & action hero movies. It is great to see these movies reproduced on DVD."
3,HELP US STARMAN !,"WOW! What can I say about this little gem of a B-Movie? It is a fast pace movie. A little too fast at times.And the music is terrible. I give it a one star {And that is being kind}. Now I did like the evil monster &witch. They were cool looking. The fight scenes were plain STUPID! Those bad guys couldn't fight a fleamuch less Starman. But all in all this is a fun little B-Movie to watch and laugh at. If you a big fan ofB-Movies as I am, you need to get this one."
5,I was inspired,I watched this video twice. It makes me mad that women are treated so shabbily but that didn't stop me from learning to box.
1,VERY UNHAPPY,THIS IS THE WRONG PAPER FOR The A203 Sharp cash register. You need 2 1/4 inch width paper NOT the 1 3/4 inch that is recommended. I guess everyone is buying the wrong paper as Amazon.com states that customers who bought the Sharp xe-a203 cash register also purchased the XEA40TRT thermal paper. DO NOT DO THIS.
1,Amazon isn't wrong!,"FYI: Sharp states on their website that this is the correct paper for that register. Sharp is wrong, not Amazon! I had the same problem."
1,Just wrong,This was included in the advertisement of the cash register as the correct paper for this particular register. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not even the correct width to fit the register. Unfortunatly this confirms a poor opinion of online shopping. Getting it right the first time is just too rare.
5,Great price.,Amazon was selling this for less than half of what the local B&M stores were. Can't go wrong there. Arrived quickly and packed well. Thanks Amazon!
3,Good Price!,This was a good price for so many rolls. Cheaper than other online sites.Simple TruthSimple Truth Too: Understanding the Bible In Everyday LifeCatch A Falling Star
3,"Fast and pretty, but ...","The output is beautiful, it's very fast, and the price is right. However, there's no driver for Windows XP, and the driver doesn't handle remote printing over a home network well."
2,OK .. but....no rebate,"I have been waiting for six months for my rebate check. No response from Minolta.The printer driver under Win 2000 is slow to start. There is a definate hesitation before the print out (not like my Xerox) and the system literally freezes for a couple of seconds.Update: The driver can literally freeze and fail...it often suggests that the 'cover is open' when it is not. You must turn off the printer and restart it.There are better inexpensive laser printers, such as the Samsung. This unit is an example of good hardware made bad by terrible drivers and support. And no, I never did receive my rebate."
1,Lots of problems on Windows XP,"This printer does not supply stable printer driver for Windows XP. The only driver is version 0.22. Good number, even not greater than 1.00.I try to contact Minolta tech-support and they gave me some instructions and I can not see any improvement on my printer. At least, they still rply you....... If you want to keep using Windows 9x, well, it is a good buy. Otherwise, you will get a lot of troubles on it....This is good product in such a price. I don't think that I can get a printer from HP or the other brand in this price. Especially, in such a bad economy season, I don't people want pay more money if they get the same thing...."
4,Surprisingly small (given the pictures),"Even though the printer is kind of tall, it takes up a surprisingly small amount of desktop space. Ideal for home use, and nicely priced (rivals higher end inkjets). I used to use an inkjet, but I realized that the amount that you spend on the replacement cartridges makes the inkjet cost much more in the long run than a laser printer (for the same amount of pages printed).In short, I like this printer.Why only 4 stars then? Well, I think HP printers are more sturdily built than this one. However, HP Laserjets usually get up to ~$400. The sweet price on this one allows me to give it the high rating."
4,Ignore that person,"I just got this printer and I have to say it works really well. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because it does not come with Windows 2000 drivers (although it can be downloaded off the QMS webpage), other than that the machine is perfect. Its small, prints really fast, is quiet, pleasing to the eye and is a lot cheaper than the other printers in its class. And if it were truly that bad I don't know why ZDNet, WinMag, and other PC magazines give it awards."
1,Disappointing to say the least.,"I wish I had read the reviews of the first volume of this series because if I had I might have not wasted both the money, and time I spent on this book.It is almost impossible for me to believe these are even the second best stories that Lonely Planet could find among all the writers they have hired over the years. This book actually makes it less likely I will use their guidebooks from now on. Why should I use a company that seems to hire people who are either drunk much of the time, naive beyond belief, or both.The travails of a man who got so drunk he missed his charter flight home from the Canary Islands. Another story of having a dental plate worked on during a holiday. Is this really the best stories they can find?While there are several moderately good stories here, spend your money more wisely on some great travel books by Dervla Murphy, Pico Iyer or, if you really want to read about someone pushing the envelope, try Danziger's Travels."
5,belly ring,"this was for my daughter, she really loved it, it is as shown in picture, very happy with product"
4,"amazing low end projection, amazing price","This guitar sounds better overall than I had expected for paying $300 online. The 5th and 6th strings send a booming sound that will easily fill a small room. Your chords will sound beefier than most other acoustics you play around, except for perhaps Martins or other big body brands. This guitar is also very light, and the maple wood on the sides and back is very pretty. I look forward to taking my playing to the advanced intermediate level over the next few years, from where I am now, a novice, tossing off some Hank Williams songs and just now learning to play scales and solos, and basic fingerpicking patterns.Why not five stars? It's not as big as I anticipated. A Martin dreadnought is definitely bigger, or wider, I think. Also, the first four strings do not project so exceptionally well as the last two, but sound pretty enough."
2,What' Original,Found same Made in Mexico Candy Canes in Walgreens at 2 boxes for $3The Candy Canes and box looked the same but there was no Bob's on them
3,Don't bother,"I haven't found this book very useful as a training aid. There is certainly some useful information here, but the presentation leaves a lot to be desired. Sandrock seems to be more fond of name-dropping than discussing the pros and cons of various training strategies. For instance, should long runs be done at a slow pace (à la Joe ""LSD"" Henderson), or at a medium/hard pace (Lydiard)? This, and other interesting topics are barely discussed.Though the book may rather be intended as a source of motivation and inspiration, I found that I had to look hard to find the good bits among all the blah-blah."
5,Gary has still got it,"This is a great album for driving in the car and just for fun. Hold On (To What You Got) and Out of Work are #1 for singing along and even dancing around while doing chores. Turn the Music Down is just plain fun. Angelyne is a definite Bruce/Little Steven tune. If you like them, you'll like this album. If you are a Gary U.S. Bonds fan from way back, you won't be disappointed. Too bad it seems to be out of print."
2,what's the hype?,"This battery appears on the surface to be one of the more upscale watch/camera/etc. high performance batteries on the market. It just goes to show what superior marketing can do for a very average product. This battery is just like all the rest in that, if you use it, it wears out. i am still looking for one that won't do that."
3,Satisfactory.,Item(s) came in a timely manner. The batteries work fine. I have no qualms about the purchasing of this product. I may shop from this seller again in the future. :)
5,Lithium Watch Battery For CR2032,This is a great product. I use it in my weight scale and it last about a year. So not bad to keep track of me loosing weight.
3,it a battery,"i don't get why there are like 10 different price ranges for this itemits just a battery... unless you use it as ammo in a sling shotor try to get zapped in a game of tittle winksthe battery i got, ie this one the review is on, didn't fix my computers booting problembut man, pretty much all battery's of this style are the same if you want to spend more because you think a different brand is more reliable, who am i to tell you otherwise~word yo"
4,Great for One!,"Used this fan this past weekend for camping, along with 2 new coleman fans All I can say is I am so happy I had this one with me. The coleman's failed after just one night! This little guy while not blasting the tent with air was perfect for just one person to feel a cool breeze and have a little noise to fall asleep to! I was very happy with this purchase!"
3,Weak fan,The LED light on this fan is bright for a rather small fan but the wind output is just too low.
3,BATTERY FAN,I BOUGHT THIS FAN FOR THE DASHBOARD OF OUR MOTOR HOME. IT IS A NICE UNIT BUT A BIT UNDER POWERED FOR THE MONEY. THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT AND WORKS WELL.
2,Waste of Time,"I bought this mainly as a tent light. It is described as having ""High intensity white LED with magnifying lens"", this is soooooo NOT TRUE!! My nightlight in the bathroom gives off more light than this thing does. I recommend a Coleman rechargable lantern or the little Rayovac, for camping or emergency use. The fan only works well if you are right in front of it. It did not move the air around my little tent. It was cheap, and sometimes, you get what you pay for."
5,brings back the real Neil Diamond,"this CD is awesome. Well worth waiting all these past 4 years for. I have been a Diamond fan for over 40 years and have seen him in concert several times. This CD comes full circle and brings back the man that we all fell in love with way back when. Thank you very much, Neil Diamond, for doing this CD and bringing back the person we all got to know with the sensitive, feeling, heartfelt musing of your brilliant mind with your special lyrics. I think that no matter what about the Sony thing, this CD is a keeper and you have again shown us what a wonderful, wonderous talent you are still and always have been. Welcome back into our world, my friend, Play Me...... always!!!"
5,WELCOME BACK...NEIL !!!,"THE BEST !!! After I ripped open my Amazon delivery this week, I have listened to this just released Neil Diamond CD non-stop. Each play sounds even better. The music, lyrics and arrangements are the best, in my opinion. There is the Neil we remember,and there is a New Neil to welcome. A great combination of Diamond and Rubin. Thanks for your efforts and accomplishment."
3,ok,"The hat is small as others have said, but it fits. The problem is, that it doesn't stay in place."
2,Its a small hat,"I wear a 7 3/8 PC, this thing does not cover my years completly, pretty much the same as every other negative review.The main problem I have with this is that it looks exactly like the polar fleece they issue you at basic training, and it is, in fact its made by the same company, but the major difference is, IT DOES NOT STRETCH compare to the olive drap that you get from basic."
1,Horrible,"The hat is so small that it won't even fit my 8 year old daughters head. I was searching for the real thing, but this wasn't it. Don't buy this hat."
3,Not impressed,"My biggest complaint is how it fits on your head. There are 4 seams or 2 cross seams (X) that come together on the top of the hat. Basically at the end of each seam, it bubbles up. You essentially have 4 bumps that stick up off your head. I guess you get what you pay for. It keeps your head slightly warm so it does solve part of its intended goal. It just ""looks"" and feels cheap... I am going to drop $20 on the Under Armour one because I had it before and it sticks to your head, is made of cotton so it doesn't get staticky (sp?), and doesn't stick up."
2,good for the money you pay,"I bought this item but unfortunately it was too big, therefore the ""one size fits all"" included people with oversized head the shipment was quick."
4,It's warm,"All I need was some fleece for my head to keep me warm. This does the trick. It doesn't have a fancy brand name on it, it just does the job. I am happy with it."
3,well,"it arrived quickly, but it is to small , it would be one size fits all if your a child. but i still wear it and it looks good it just covers the top of my ears. so i guess you get what you pay for."
2,"""G.I. Type"" is a knockoff","When I went shopping for a fleece watch cap I was looking for the same type of cold weather headgear the military issues. The name and images would suggest this item is the same quality as military issued fleece caps, however that is incorrect. This cap fits awkwardly on the head in sort of a square shape due to how it's stitched, and doesn't cover the ears. I guess you get what you pay for. Definitely not worth it."
3,A little small.,The watch cap was as described but the one size fits all in this case was aimed at folks with smaller heads if you have a large head i would recommend one of rothco's caps with elastic.
1,Poor FIt.,Overall a very poor fit. The hat was far too small and did not extend past the middle of my ear.
3,Surprisingly large...,"In stark contrast to other reviews, I have a large head (7 3/4) and this hat fits very loosely. Usually every hat I buy is too tight, so it's a little surprising. Seems like they might need to step up QC, but it's a cheap hat so... It does cover about half of my ears and is quite warm. I would prefer it be a little tighter, but it will do until I find something better."
2,Polar Fleece or Wool???,"Yes, it was only $4 or so, but the hat that came was one of those standard wool knit beanies that are super long and you have to fold up the sides. Funny thing is the outside package label said Rothco Polar Fleece, but right on the inside, through the clear plastic bag, was a huge label tag that said 100% WOOL.It wasn't what I ordered, but I've decided to keep it as a backup hat for winter use."
3,Nice Hat,"The hat is nice and soft which is what I expected it to be, but I guess it's just the new style to have them just big enough to cover your ears. I'm used to the big hats from when I was a child that you could roll up at the bottom. While this hat is doing the job it's not what I thought it was going to be."
2,loose,not GI...this thing covers half of my ears and sits very loose on the head...spend the extra 6 bucks and get something mil-spec
2,Too short. Not form fitting.,Doesnt fit right and my ears are left uncovered. Next time i'll pay a little more to get better quality.
3,Okay,"So this product says one size fits all, that isn't the case. The one I received was small enough that it doesn't cover my ears, but its thick enough that it looks like I'm wearing a ""astrakhan hat"" from Russia. The only thing true about this product is that it's warm. I would NOT order another one of these and I recommend that if you want a good fleece watch cap you look elsewhere."
3,Functions as expected,"I was unimpressed as the color was a little off from what I expected. However, I did order the largest one and it still didnt cover my ears. It is very possible though, that I have a abnormally large dome."
3,Warm hat for small heads,This hat is very warm and the quality seems fine however as many have said it's quite small. I wear a 7 hat size and it is even small on me. The hat just barely covers my earlobes. I would recommend this hat for females or people who wear smaller than a 7 hat size.
2,One size does not fit all!,"If you have a huge head this might fit. I wear a 7.25 hat, and this is ridiculously big on my head. Because it is so big, it allows the cold air to whip right on in, defeating the purpose of wearing something to keep you warm. Nt only that, you look ridiculous. Material is fine, sizing is terrible. One size does not fit all."
4,Very warm!,"It fit well and is very comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I wish it was just a little longer, but I also have a large head. Even with this though it still fit well enough that I can't complain."
2,Super Small,It Is a very small Watch cap. Buying for a child then its a good choice. Not for adults at all!!!!!
5,Just as advertised,"Great fleece beanie for a great low price. The beanie comes just as advertised, fleece and soft. Highly recommend to everyone!"
2,Really for small heads,"I bought this for the wife and a few black ones for me. They are way to small!! For the money, the material is fine. But they are not even long enough for my 8 year old. Good luck finding something else and I hope this stopped you from wasting money. I am giving them 2 stars because of the prompt shipment. Not worth the hassle of returning."
5,Keepin Warm,"Great Cap, Helps keep your head warm even when it is windy. Wish i would have bought two of them. One for each coat"
3,Fits Small,I wear a 7 1/2 hat and I think this hat is to small for my head. I was hoping for a hat that would cover my ears but they do not.
3,GI Koufee,"First off I wear a size 7 1/2 fitted ball cap. This item is ""one size fits all"" except me. It barely covers the tips of my ears. It resembles a Muslim koufee the way it fits on my head. I will admit that it is pretty well made, however the picture for how it fits is misleading (that must be a small manequin head). If you wear a fitted hat that is smaller than a size 7 then this will probably be fine for you."
2,Review on ACU Polar Fleece Cap,"The bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all, but either I have a big head or something becuase it doesn't cover my ears all the way. As for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine. So I guess if you have a big head don't get it becuase it will not cover your ears."
2,Too short,"Like many other reviewers have stated, avoid this product if you would like it to cover your ears and you are older than 10. It seems to be a quality stiched product and thats why it receives two stars. Additionaly, like previously stated it is thinner than other fleece caps I have had in the past. Save your money and find one that fits correctly!"
4,Functional.,"What can I say? It's a black fleece watch cap. I wish it would cover my ears a little better, but that's probably got to do more with the shape of my head than anything else. Good product for a good price."
1,"Fits Poorly, I dont think Most People will like it","I give one star, because the hat is completely unusable to me.Doesn't cover the ears well and with little movement it starts to lift up. I didn't think i had to read the reviews on a winter hat, but I learned my lesson.I think Most Normal sized Men, will have the same problem, so save your money and keep looking!God Bless"
3,GI?,"IT'S WARM AND IT COVERS MY EARS MOSTLY BUT IT'S A LITTLE LOOSE. IT WORKS BETTER WITH A FLEECE HEADBAND UNDERNEATH. BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I COULD WEAR IT UNLESS IT WERE REALLY COLD BECAUSE IT LOOKS A LITTLE WEIRD. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THE SEEMS COME TOGETHER. WHEN I TRIED IT ON AND LOOKED IN THE MIRROR, I SAID TO MYSELF, ""UM, NO."" I THINK I WOULD NEED SEE ANOTHER DUDE WEAR IT SO I CAN SEE HOW IT LOOKS ON SOMEONE ELSE. BUT IT DOES FEEL NICE AND WARM. I THINK IT WOULD BE ALRIGHT IF I WERE WEARING FULL WINTER GEAR AND A LARGE JACKET. THEN THE HAT WOULD BE PROPORTIONAL."
4,I love bromeliads and I love this book!,This book has great photos to help identify many of the most commonly kept bromeliads. Mr. Steens also provides a thorough discussion of cultivation and propagation. I recommend this book.
2,Details,"The author fails to include discriptions of the creations between these covers. It left me sorry that I ordered this book. The purchase was due from the recommendtations from members of the local Woodturners group I hold membership, The North Coast Woodturners. At our club meetings held once a month members explain how the piece was chucked in the lathe and the ideas that created the piece. At times the turner starts with one idea and because of unforseen problems in the wood once turning exposes a flaw in the wood, and has to make the best of the piece and in many cases ends with a better product than the original preception."
2,Left/Right Balance is Not Centered,"If you search the internet for ""m-audio"" and ""studiopro 3"" you will find that I am not the only person that noticed that the right channel is much quieter than the left channel. If you do not have a balance control on your player you will probably not be happy with these speakers. I bought these specifically for mixing but with without an external balance control they can't be used for that purpose. I purchased aSennheiser HZR-62 Stereo Volume Controlfrom Amazon which is a simple in line balance/volume control to keep on my desktop... problem solved."
4,not too bad not too good,"After reading the somewhat negative reviews I bought a pair of these used.The owner said this pair I bought did not exhibit the negative tendecies that other reviewers posted. Paid for them,brought them home,and first tried them plugged into my laptop.Good balance between the left and right with none of the past posts of the right monitor being lower in volume than the left. Also the off/volume didn't exhibit any noise nor any crackling noises out of either speaker.I gave these monitors a four-star rating because to me they don't have the volume of a 10 watt output;more of a 5 watt loudness to my ears."
3,fair to midland..for someone who just wants better than cheapo speakers,"I've had these for a while. At first I was quite pleased with the general sound, but when I needed them to put out power, the amp just didn't have it. Later the unit developed a buzz in the speaker....I never really pushed them all that hard except a cpl times for short periods like a minute or so, not hours. I think the buzz was from a loose speaker frame, I didn't bother trying to fix it and it was too late for warranty request, so I lived with it. I may get m audio again, not sure, but if I do, it'll be the 20watt ones....these would be ok for the wife who hates the factory speaker in a desktop unit, and has no other needs to push it hard."
5,Delivered fast and on time.,"Delivered fast and on time. I'm very happy with the speakers, they sound great. I'm using them with my home desktop computer."
2,DO NOT buy these speakers,"I read all the amazon reviews and was basis for my purchase. I bought at another site for $76 w/shipping. Speakers look good and beefy for their size, but you are not buying these for looks. I read one or two complaints about one speaker not playing as loud as the other...that is exactly what i got brand new out of the box...if you unhook the good speaker and turn up the volume(volume control speaker is the bad one) all the way on the bad speaker it is no louder than someone talking at a normal decibel and it crackles..basically a bad speaker...I tried to call customer support one night, was on hold for 45min and gave up, tried again tonight-busy signal...i tried online request for help..still waiting 30hrs after complaint...so i am bashing these speakers not only on out of the box quality(did i mention made in china, like everything else we buy) but complete lack of customer support. The speaker that works does sound good and do like speaker stands it comes with."
1,"Good sound, poor quality product","I bought these because they are supposedly professional grade monitors with excellent sound. The sound was excellent, but the speakers must be cheaply made with bad components.The first problem I had was with the aux line out. If I plugged something in there and then unplugged it to use the speakers again, only the right speaker would work. After fidgeting with the cords and multiple combinations of plugging in and unplugging both speakers would finally work again.The second problem was with the left speaker. After only 8 months of use, it started going in and out and within a week it stopped working altogether. Maybe it's just an isolated incident, but if you do decide to buy, make sure you hang on to that receipt."
5,Great sounding small speakers,"I was looking for some smaller speakers that did not suffer from too much ""boom"" for bass and shrill or harsh sounding highs. The M-Audio's really sound great! I listen to alot of acoustic guitar, jazz, classical and blues.All of those genres sound fantastic. Speakers are easy to set up and come with some ""wedge"" style speaker stands - well, speaker boosters or maybe tilters might be a better description. :-)I would highly recommend these to anyone who wants accurate sound from an iPod, laptop or desktop computer."
2,"Cheap, poorly-built, lackluster sound.","After using these speakers for two years, I can confidently say they suck.The low price and purported high-quality sound sold me, but in the end I am disappointed. At home I have two KRK RP5 speakers, and it is a night and day difference in sound quality.Cons:- The right speaker is noticeably quieter than left speaker, especially at low volumes.- They really, seriously lack bass.- They are not well-built - the right speaker often cuts out as the circuitry gets confused, thinking I have headphones plugged in. I have to repeatedly thrust and jiggle my headphone plug into the jack to unconfuse it.Pros:- They come with awesome little plastic wedges that you can use to angle the speakers up to point at your head, if they rest on your desk.I would recommend buying any powered computer speakers with subwoofer instead of these. They are really not worth the money."
3,Not bad at all for ths $,"I have the StudioPro 3's hooked to my desktop recording rig. They can be a lil crackly at high volume, but generally they are fine and a great deal."
5,Sound great,"These speakers sound great and are worth every penny. As a few people noted, the bass is what you would expect from speakers this size."
2,Right speaker died after a year,I origionally gave these speakers high marks for quality of sound. But apparently the quality stops there. After a little over a year using these as computer monitors. The right side stopped working. I tried a different cable and even hooked them up to a different source and still no right side output. Since I am three months out of warranty I guess I am screwed. I also Googled this problem and it does appear that some others have had similar problems. Sorry now that I bought them.
1,No!,"I had this desktop audio monitors that I used about daily for a year and then, one day, they were done working. The sound quality was mediocre at best and the bass response was flimsy, high frequency response was thin. Buy something else that sounds better and lasts longer than this did."
1,"Broken, right out of the box. They just don't work.","One works, one doesn't. Tried every combination of cables, etc. Even the headphone jack doesn't work. They're just bad... and they're going back."
1,Do not buy these!,"These monitors worked great for about a year and then, as many other people have stated, the left speaker stopped working. M audio's warranty for these is only a year, so by the time they stop working the warranty is up. Don't waste your money!!!"
5,Excellent,"Great speakers for CD Player/ipod music player, laptop/desktop computers. Deep bass and balanced treble for watching movies and listening music on the go or at home."
2,It shows its age,"I have serious misgivings about the facts presented in this book. The original French text was written in the 20's. I was given this book as I am working on a masterwork on the cultural history of Olives and Olive oil. In this respect she often jumps to the wrong conculsion, and makes broad judgements that have been discounted by anthropology since the 1960's. For instance she lists oil stores in ancient Babylonia as being olive oil. We know from further scholership that this would have been sesame oil, and that olive oil was a fuel and not a consumptive in that culture at the time. This causes me to question the entire book. This may be an interesting read, but at least with respect to Olives and Olive oil, there is much better out there."
1,Amusing but completely unreliable,"This fat volume about food and cooking, packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories, is amusing but completely unreliable, very out of date (1920s!), and often just plain wrong.As a source of information about the history of food, it is useless. Many of the assertions of fact here are questionable, and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out. The author seems to have taken snippets from here and there (mostly, apparently, from French sources), sorted them thematically, and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text. No doubt some part of the assertions here is true, but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others!What's more, the translation is poor. Not only are some gallicisms rendered word-for-word (and so only intelligible if you translate them back into French), but there are no translator's notes for topical references.I cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food."
5,Simply delicious,"I've been reading, re-reading, and browsing in this book since I bought it almost a year ago. I find it quite extraordinary. As a lifelong historian, I appreciate the exceptional research and the bright way the translator spins anecdotal hisotry into readable passages. As a single man who just started cooking some months ago, I find this book is also a ""brain prompter."" To be able to read about the history of the spices and foods which one prepares is like a double meal, one for the body and another for the mind.While the book, naturally, follows strongly the French historical line, nevertheless, it's still fascinating to read, cull through, and refresh the memory about even simple foods like bread, pork, and fish. If you're a cook of any kind, with this book you'll be able to spark dinner conversations with snippets of history about what you've served."
3,A very French interpretation of the History of Food,"I use the book in its original French version and have not read the translated English text. The writing is quite complex and heavy and at times chauvinistically French. The work however is very comprehensive and overflows with details and anecdotes. Sometimes, one is left to wonder how realistic and founded some of the statements are. Regardless, it is a fun reference work which is plenty worth buying."
4,Enjoyable reading,"The Bold and magnificent dream covers U.S. History from 1492-1815 in just 500 pages. The book is well written and enjoyable to read. However if you are really trying to learn our very early history this book will not satisfy your thirst. On topics such as The Battle of Saratoga, The Battle of New Orleans, Prince Philips War etc. that I had already read about, I realized how lightly each topic was covered and how much really interesting history is being missed. Overall I really did enjoy the book. If you are looking for a well written overview this is a great book. You will certainly learn a lot more from it than I was ever taught in high school or college."
2,Poor Packaging,"For $5 packaging, at least use a flat rate box. The spindle case was cracked cause all the seller used was a bubble wrapped interior envelope.And I didn't even get an invoice/receipt."
2,"Not worth the money, stick with a better brand","These discs are fine for burning data, but I couldn't get any of the discs to actually burn a lightscribe disc. I didn't try every disc in the pack, but after going through about 10 from the pack I decided none of them would work and gave up. Save your money and by a better brand, like Verbatim, if you really want to use lightscribe."
2,Quiet and perfectly made but...,"I have read reviews elsewhere on this album and they praise the emotion and delivery. But for me every word seems drawn out and laboured and after a while I get bored. Be warned, I always prefer my Jazz uptempo - so its probably just my bias talking.The liner notes say ""Jimmy Scott"" vocals (a man) but the cover is a woman (surely?) and the vocals certainly sound very feminine. Whats the story? Who is singing?To conclude - if you find Norah Jones a bit noisy and want something to smooth along in the background (while you mix martinis) then this may be a 4 out 5 album.But for me its just too dull - so only gets 2 out 5."
2,Not worth the money-Very wide,You will not fit through isles using this stroller! It was constantly bumping into everything at the mall! It's so wide!The harness/straps are flimsy and not made well.The storage basket is short so tall items will fall out.It's heavy too.Small uncomfortable seat.Smooth ride but that's the only positive.
1,Too big for bookshelves,"This review is specific to the size of the book, not the content. It's extremely irritating that this book is much larger than a mass market paperback or even the slightly taller paperbacks that have become so popular lately. The product dimensions are: 5.9"" width x 0.8"" depth x 9.0"" height. It won't fit on my custom bookshelves."
5,Keeping Watch,"The series featuring ""Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell is entertaining and fun to read. Ms. King is an excellant story teller. This book captures the fall out from the Vietnam era in soldiers lives after the war. If the reader enjoyed her book, ""Folly"" then they will enjoy ""Keeping Watch""."
3,Not her best work,"I love Laurie R. King and have eagerly awaited each of her novels. And enjoyed each one greatly. This one however could have used some major pruning. I was instantly disappointed to discover how much of the novel was set in Vietnam, as I have no interest in war stories, and almost gave it up. I imagine many of her heavily female readership feels the same. Once the Vietnam stuff was over, though, the story became her typical compelling read. (...) The really interesting story was Alan's story back in the states, and his relationship with the kid. (...)"
4,Ahhhhhh nice!,"Great music from the heart of ""indie rock"" and with the ever-glorious veneer of dream pop = wonderful"
4,Rope bracelet,I was expecting a flat mesh chain not a rope but still a nice piece of jewelry. It took a really long time to come though.
5,Horse Trails Along the Desert Trails,"""No one would suspect that Sanford Yoder, well known as bishop, author, and college president once lived in the hardships and privations of the frontier West and rode the trails of the desert. But in this collection of delightful reminiscences of the days when pioneers were cowboys he tells us of life in the West and what he saw from its trails. In his inimitable and easygoing style he has painted for us a picture of the West when he was young(1905-1908. You will like the rare good-humored chapters about 'The Knights of the Jingling Spurs,' or the informal stories of cow-punchers and empty desert sands - empty except for sand,cacti, moonlight, hot wind, a horse, and Sanford Yoder."" from the endpaper of dj."
1,Nice but I can't use it.,"I like the watches but all two came in the package broken. I would like to return them but I don't feell like going through all that. What I did is was put some crazy glue on them, hopefully that would last a little while."
1,Old and a disappointment,I reviewed this item before not sure why they are asking again. I was disappointed in the actual product. The packaging was so old it was stained yellow and had other kinds of age spots or signs of long wear. It was dusty as well and seemed to be something bought by an individual who changed their mind and then decided to sell it back. The battery was not working anymore so we had to purchase a new one for it. The picture shows two watches as u can see but only one came in the package. It was manufactured from 2006 so I know it is an old item almost forgotten by its previous owner. Even my niece seems to not be interested in it as she showed no enthusiasm for it and hardly wants to wear it. I think some indication should have been made on the description of the item that it was very old. I will not buy from 'Happy Bday' ever again!!! Amazon should check stock of retailers they represent on their site.
1,JUNK,DONT BE TAKEN IN BY LIGHT WEIGHT AND FLEXIBILITY. THESE AIR HOSES KINK UP AND COIL UP VERY EASILY. AND MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE A BIRDS NEST OF AIR HOSE WRAPED AROUND YOUR FEET.THEY ARE NOT VERY CUT RESISTANT EITHER.
4,Challenging and fun!,This is a great video! I've been doing pilates for a few years and was surprised to be so sore in my abs for days after doing this workout. The foam roll really adds a nice challenge. Moira and PJ O'Clair do a great job alternating instruction.
2,"Great seller, product not so great","Seller was fabulous, had item within a couple days of order, cant beat the service. Item itself is fairly shoddy problem with seem at waistband not being well sown and have had to re-sew three rips at seem in two wearings...."
5,Custer's last stand and more.,"This is a great concise work of biography and history, written by one of the greatest living historians of the American West. I think some of the reviewers miss the point:this is a biography first, and an analysis of Little Bighorn secondly. This is probably the best bio of Custer for the interested to start with because of its meticulous research and the brevity of its length. Once you read ""Cavalier in Buckskin"" do not be surprised if you seek out Utley's other fine works of Western and Native American history. Utley's a class act, and so is this fine work which combines the best of academic and popular history about a popular and controversial individual in American History."
4,"I dont like salsa, but this is a very good album","even If i can not dance salsa,, this album is one of the best of the genre. his first and perhaps best."
5,not just for children,"This book is a gem. It's tender, clever, and deftly written. It's wonderful for reading aloud. I had trouble finding it for years, and I'm so pleased to see that it's available again."
5,Fabulous for sharing with your parents (or children)!,"This book combines enchanting animal characters with beautiful illustrations, and some rather sophisticated literary concepts. It reads very well aloud, and is worthy of sharing. This little brown bat presents a wonderful introduction to poetry, and a joy for all ages."
2,"Yes, USB 1, NOT 2!","I believe the write-up is misleading. I'm a geek and looked at this several times and nothing jumped out at me to indicate it was only a USB 1 device. Especially since it says USB 2.0 compatible. That's misleading because ""EVERY"" USB 1 device is technically USB 2 compliant. That's because in actuality, USB 2.0 supports USB 1! I too wasted my money on this as I already have plenty of USB 1 card readers.And as an aside, I ordered a Dazzle Zio 2.0 reader and did a side by side test. It took 55 seconds to upload a block of pictures where the Dazzle took less than 5 seconds for the same block! Save your money.BTW, I gave it two stars since it does work and is small and portable, it's just not USB 2."
4,Hot!!,"This is a sexy shoe! At first it really hurt my feet, but after a few wears, they are quite comfortable and stretched nicely. They got lots of compliments and are different than a traditional black pump. The suede is nice and the buckles and straps give it an elegant look."
1,funky shoe,"This pump was cute and stylish, but the heel height and width of shoe wasn't right for me. I had to send back. If you have a slightly wider width foot (not D but not average B) this shoe would be perfect"
5,Another awesome Monster product!,"I ordered these cables as a present to go along with a Sony DVP-NS710H/B DVD player (also ordered here on Amazon). The player came with free cables (non-Monster brand) and when connected to the TV there was a series of white patches and colors along the top and bottom of the display. After swapping the free cables with the Monster B SV1/100 cables, the display was absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Nothing else was adjusted, just replaced the cables. I've used Monster cables on other projects in the past and they definitely are worth every bit you pay for them."
2,Wish they lasted longer,"Compared to the original rubber tips for my walking poles, these tips were far less durable. They fit well, but wore out so quickly. As an estimate, I think these tips lasted only one-fourth of what the original ones did. The quality of the rubber is obviously inferior. Although the price was appealing, I think I may purchase the original tips even if they cost twice as much."
5,ok,i ordered for christmas and recieved it on time with no delays. would use this company again. no worries. thanks
4,Surprisingly Addictive Series,"I was ready to dislike this series. After all, I'm an adult who has raised my family, so what could I have in common with a bunch of kids in high school?But the series surprised me when it chose to tackle some thorny life issues head on. The creators didn't flinch or hold back in discussing the results of teen-age pregnancy. The audience gets to see the good, bad, and ugly which results when two kids have to grow up way before they're ready.The kids are all likeable and everyone can relate to at least one of them, even if you find yourself wincing as you remember some of the ""brilliant"" decisions you made when you were young."
3,Secrets? No one can keep a secret at U.S. Grant High School,"It is amazing how quickly things change on SLOTAT. Gestation periods, like romances, are measured in several episodes. Did the oh-so-faithful Ben sow some wild oats in Italy? Everyone at U.S. Grant High School has 20-20 hearing so no secret goes unheard in the hallway. A hallway in high school during class changes is LOUD!In any case, Volume 3 introduces a gay character, Griffin, who looks more than a bit old to be a freshman, even a college freshman, and who immediately becomes a bodyguard to Ashley, as if she needs one. All Griffin does is say ""I'm gay!"" immediately to everyone he meets. Is Griffin going to have a love interest? Or is Griffin going to be the only character who HAS a secret and keeps it?Some of the dialog is sharp, but the plots are getting a bit far out. Hence minus one star.The extras on the Volume 3 disk are minimal. Certainly there must be out-takes and bloopers that the audience would enjoy. Hence minus a second star."
1,Misrepresentation,"This is not season 3. It is the 1st part of season two. Season 3 starts on June 7th, 2010. You will have some very disappointed customers. Glad I did my research, so I'm not one of them."
5,THE BEST book on Caregiving I've ever read!,"This book in superb. Having an ailing parent, I turned to this book for the helpful tips discussed on the jacket cover. But it was so much more than that....it made me feel understood. The plain-speak and thoughtfulness in the text made the goal of caregiving seem much more attainable....and less overwhelming. The stories and examples of others in a caregiving capacity helped me to feel not alone. I strongly recommend this book, whether you yourself are a caregiver or not, it is a must read book of the year."
5,Caregiving help,Good book for caregivers to aging parents. I used this book to give as a door prize at a presentation on caregiving for caregivers. Price is right.
2,Not all that is advertised,"I'm sure this is a nice device, but beware that it is not compatible with the Windows 98 operating system. No Win 98 drivers are available anywhere. Only purchase this if you have a newer OS."
5,again,I have always had a great review of Dave Pike and his albums and this is another album that I can say is very good. This album is one of his older albums but is still on top of the list for being another great album.
2,Not impressed and miss my $$,"Spend what I though was a lot of money, but stridex pads at Walmart are just as effective and cheaper"
3,Nostalgic,"I purchased this book for nostalgic reasons. I bought an original copy 400 years ago, just after Guttenberg set the type, but the dog ate it with my homework.Listen, you can no more learn to speak Italian from this book, or ANY book, than from a napkin at an Italian restaurant. You will learn to recognize words and phrases, though not necessarily how to pronounce them (or understand them when spoken to you). You want to learn Italian? Then revert back to when you were 12 years old and immerse yourself in the language (preferably in Italy). Otherwise retain the services of an interpreter."
4,A good book for beginners,This a good book for beginners. Especially students or people just entering programming. The use of examples and comparisons helps make the learning process easy!!!!
5,Another winner from Norman Vincent Peale,"I have read 95% of his books and they have all been wonderful. This one is no exception. Although this one is more updated than many of his older works thereby making it easier to relate to. Dr. Peale was a very inspiring preacher/author and any book you can get your hands on with his name on it is worth every effort.This book will inspire and uplift you. It doesn't contain complicated theological jargon, but clear cut principles that everyone can relate to.Not a hard read by any means."
4,It dares to be sweet,"Sweet and genuinely romantic ... neither are hip in today's world and yet this book is unabashadely, successfully both. A slim volume, it concentrates on feelings and values. It takes its time making its points and we enjoy the journey it takes to get to those points. Yes, the overall message is a familair one. Yet most of us still don't get it, so it bears repeating. And yes, one of the main characters -- and story catalysts -- is a cat. I was amused by the reviewer who gave this a negative review because he wasn't a cat person. Um ... the subtitle of the book is ""A love story."" What did he expect?"
5,"A ""novel"" love story.",This is a story you have not heard before. A young man learns the meaning of love thanks to a feline friend who helps him see what is really important in life. It's a simple read but the lesson is monumental.
2,Odd Writing Style,"Couldn't get through more than the first chapter. This book was written so oddly, with very little dialogue. I don't know what it was about it that I didn't like, but I didn't. Maybe it was that reading it was akin to watching a movie through fog; everything was sort of...vague, including the feelings of the characters."
5,Sentimental...and lovely,"I was given a copy of this book by my mother, who termed it 'delightful'. It was much more than that. I too am a feline-file... As I read, I remembered the adage that a cat is never owned, but choses whom 'it' will own. Yes, the ending is sentimental and predictable, but that doesn't make the story any less readable. I cried at the ending, and made sure my kitty got a little extra love. I think even non cat owners will fall in love with the story."
3,The Bachelor's Cat,"A cute story about a bachelor who could not find true love. He was looking in all of the wrong places. After he acquired a new cat, he realized the qualities he was looking for in a woman. Later an incident with his cat showed him how to say ""yes"" to true love and commitment."
4,Kendall,I thought this was a great buyAnd I really like how fast it shipsIt arrived right away and its good quality
3,A bit thin,Not up to the standard of the BD. A bit thin and somewhat dry. This product is usable. I think for the price differential it worth spending a little extra on a better quality wipe
2,Not the Best Alcohol Prep Pads,"These alcohol prep pads shred very easily and lose their wetness quickly. Bear in mind, I am using these to wipe down surgical instruments. If looking for something an alcohol prep pad to just wipe the skin/infected area once or twice real quick, these will suffice. For my purposes, they do not."
3,OK but thin,"I bought these hoping I would get a nice thick alcohol filled piece of cloth so it would be something of one second use. But what i got was a thin piece that when squeezed you get about a drop, which says it's not going to have much of a long use per piece. But that said it does do the job also it makes for awesome fire start tinder."
1,Dissatisfied,I was expecting to receive wipes. Instead I received these tiny pads that are meant for injection pre-cleaning. Be careful before buying if this is not their intended use.
3,standard wipes,works as was intended. good price with no dry packets so far.I would buy again ikf I dont get a better price
4,Pretty good first novel,"If you like science fiction about genetically modified people, AIs with personality, lots of fighting -- then this is a pretty good action-packed book. What, I think, makes it actually worthwhile, however, is that the main character, Catherine, is well drawn. Unfortunately, some of the other characters are rather cardboardish. As I understand it, this is the first book in a series, so maybe we'll learn more about motivations in the future books. But certainly, this is worth a nice afternoon of reading. I look forward to reading more of the author's books in the future."
2,Cliche and derivative . . .,Moriarity does an admirable job of world-building but his characterizations tend to be two-dimensional and predictable. The personalities and dialogue will be familiar with anyone who has watched 70's era cop show. All that's missing is the cheap jazz background. The villains don't twirl black capes and laugh maniacally and neither do the power brokers stroll around in smoking jackets and ascots but the characters come too darn close to that for my tastes. Pass this novel up unless you consider eye rolling a sport.
5,A Talent to Watch,This is an amazing first book. The author plunges you into the middle of a completely new world. The science and the human (and artificial intelligence) are seamless.
2,I gave up half-way through,"Maybe I'm getting too old, but I just gave up. I realized I didn't care what happened to any of the characters and the technologies/realities were too vague and confusing to keep straight. YMMV."
2,Tedious,"The book promises a lot, but is really just a Company Town Murder Mystery with a sci-fi setting."
5,THESE KIDS ROCK!,"I heard this CD blasting from my teenage son's room the other day. I'm not a punk rock fan, but Orange immediately caught my ear. Their music sounds fresh and their songs are fantastic and actually musical (am I showing my age?). Most of all, ORANGE KICKS ASS! I was blown away when I found out the band members are 16 and 17 years old. You'd never know--they sound like seasoned pros. I was a professional rock and studio musician for 20 years and I cannot believe how well these kids play. I predict they'll be big. Finally, there's some music my kid and I can agree on."
1,Welcome To The World Of Terrible Music,"This was the first album I had bought off of amazon, and i was pretty psyched when it arrived. But 5 minutes into the album I knew I had made a mistake. Orange is a bunch of make-up-wearing wannabe punks, with fake british accents. Apparently they didn't get the memo that said that songs should RHYME. Perhaps as they mature as a band, and as people, they will make a good album; but this wasn't it. The guitar and other instrumental parts are fine for a new band, but just as you think that maybe this could be a good song, they spout some terrible lyrics with no rythm. I want my money back and you will too if you buy this album!"
5,Bo Derek is the most beautiful woman ever!,"Bo Derek is the most beautiful woman in the world. Who cares if she can't act, the nudity alone is worth the video."
1,omigod!!!!,Terrible terrible trash.None of the actors could save this trashy wishy washy thingy.Dont ever think of buying the video.In total you will glimpse about 2 minutes of the aging nude Derek bod.
2,Well...They're OK,"Picked these up with my purchase since they were pretty cheap, but wouldn't get them again. They are not true to size...at least my batch wasn't. They're just a little smaller than an ordinary 6mm BB so they will roll out of the barrel very often. You can see the difference when you load a 6mm BB into the mag and when you load these. A good BB is snug in the mag while these practically fall out. Yea, they're cheap, but it's more of a hassle to find some in the bunch that are shaped right and actually the correct size."
5,full insulated quick disconnects,"Have ordered from this vendor before, because my local Ace doesn't stock these. So will use this retailer as my supply. Good price and I can count on them to have them."
5,A GREAT re-working of Dracula!!!,"2012-11-27I read The Dracula Tape in mebbe 1997. What a great re-spin of Bram Stoker!According to Saberhagen, Dracula is a very proper middle-aged man living in a Chicago high-rise, and fighting the forces of evil (they're all trying to get him, y'know). Ya gotta love it!The Dracula Tape has gone in and out of print, and I wanted to make certain I had a copy available. I was happy to seeThe Dracula Tape (Saberhagen's Dracula Series)for KF. Now that it's digital, it will live forever. (HEY! Just like the old man!)The entire Dracula Series gets my highest recommendation! Holmes, the Borgias, and other familiar names pop up in the different books - they're all a hoot!"
3,The Dracula Tape,"As with Seance for a Vampire, it it lacking. Poor structure, sad character development. Didn't hold my interest."
3,A retelling of Dracula from the Count’s point of view,"PROS: The way Saberhagen humorously rips apart the Stoker version.CONS: A little slow, failed to keep my attention.BOTTOM LINE: Better than the Original (at least I finished this one)....Saberhagen apparently thought along the same lines because his Dracula Tape, told from the point of view of the Count, repeatedly points out the flaws of the original.Unfortunately, that was the most appealing part of this book. While it made for a quick read, it suffered the same curse as the original; it was sometimes quite boring. I would like to give it another chance though..."
2,"Expected more from ""novel of the century""","I was curious to see Dracula's perspective, but this probably would be better suited for an audiobook (Fred, tell amazon.com it's ok to give you my email address so you can financially thank me for this suggestion).First of all, especially at the ending, keep in mind this book was printed in 1975.The rude comments about Van Helsing (such as: ""Van Helsing's answer was yes. I paraphrase omitting some five hundred words."" and ""The vision of Van Helsing as a vampire is one before which my imagination balks; this is doubtless only a shortcoming on my part; he may have been well fitted for the role, since as we have seen he had already the power, by means of speech, to cast his victims into a stupor."") are sometimes dead-on funny and othertimes tiresome.For the price, a worthwhile read. However, the time could be much better spent re-reading the original Dracula."
3,A good introduction to silent films,"This book contains profiles of the 50 best silent films by the author, and profiles on many great silent performers. The bulk of this book was actually written by film historian William K. Everson, with Joe Franklin contributing very little to it. In the 1960's, when there were few books about the silent era available, this book was the best to be found. Things have greatly changed since, with many more silent films being rediscovered, and much more scholarship being done on the period. If the authors re-wrote the book today, the list of best films and performers would be somewhat different. Regardless, this is the perfect book for someone who knows little about American silent films from 1900-1931 and needs an good introduction."
5,Silent Films Speak Again,"If you like silent film history then you have to have this book. It's got pictures from all the good ones: The Great Train Robbery 1903, The Birth of a Nation 1915, And the story about a Chinese man in Broken Blosssoms 1919. You have to have this book as it is RARE and one of a kind."
4,Wonderful moldy oldies book,"The book I purchased, ""Classics of the Silent Screen by Joe Franklin"" had a wonderful musty bookstore odor to it. Pages were crisp and clean and the covers were perfect. Great item!"
5,Can't eat just one!,"ALL I CAN SAY IS OMG!THESE LITTLE TREATS ARE SO ADDICTIVE AND ONLY HAVE 10 GRAMS OF SUGAR IN NINE WAFERS!THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST TASTING WAFER COOKIES I HAVE EVER HAD AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR ME BEING ON A DIET, WOULD EAT THE WHOLE BAG IN ONE SITTING!I CAN'T QUITE DESCRIBE THE FLAVOR EXCEPT TO SAY IT IS LIGHT, RICH AND NOT TOO SWEET.I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT THESE FROM AMAZON, JUST FROM MY LOCAL HEALTH FOOD MARKET.BUT THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS CHEAPER COMPARED TO BUYING IT LOCALLY WHERE I AM."
5,Wonderful,"I love these little wafer cookies. They are wonderful. Great flavor, delicate crunch, and knowing that it's natural and nothing in it is genetically modified makes snacking feel better."
3,Intensely Sweet,"These are obviously good cookies, considering the other reviews. But for me they were too rich and sweet. If that's what you're looking for, go for it. But if you're looking for a mellower taste, look elsewhere."
5,Real Nice. Light Fresh Lemon Taste. Mmmmm.,"Here's another of the little items I find in my nearby Fresh and Easy store. It's a British company and they have a lot of imported items. This trip I picked up a bag of Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies. Oh boy, are these good! They disappear real fast. Be ready to apply controls. They're very light and tasty and not overly sweet. The filing has a real light, fresh lemon taste. Real nice. Just right. Just give it a bite and a couple light chews and it's gone and your hand is involuntarily reaching for another one. Mmmmm. Now how am I ever going to keep these around the house? Well, I guess that a lot of others feel the same way. Did you notice that on the 33 reviews, 30 gave it five stars?Gary Peterson"
5,Punch of lemon flavor,"These Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafers are the best I've tasted. They are natural with a real lemon 'punch' in every bite. Plus they are not overly sweet like some other wafer brands. I will definitely buy this brand again. (Since you get eight bags in the order, I gave my mom a bag, my sister a bag, and a friend a bag of these wafers and they all told me the same thing...they love them, what great lemon taste, etc. and wanted to know where they could purchase them.)"
5,Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookie,This wafer has the best tart and freshest lemon flavor than any other lemon cookie ever! Put them in the freezer and they taste is even better.
5,Analytical Reading Inventory,"I have used every edition of the Analytical Reading Inventory, but this one is the best yet. Since I am a teacher educator, I find the accompanying audiotapes quite helpful--both to me and to my students. The content of the graded passages has always been real children's literature, and thus, more like real reading. There are both narrative and expository passages with different forms for pre-and post-assessments, or for comparing silent reading comprehension to oral reading comprehension. The directions for use are very reader-friendly. And, for this latest edition, the reader passages come in a separate booklet for easy use in the testing situation. I think anyone using this inventory would be well satisfied."
4,Very impressionistic,Nice LP from one of the best jazz pianists who ever lived. Very impressionistic in its texture.
5,Every High School should have a copy of it.,I am an international student and much needed a financial aid to meet my college costs for studing in USA. This book guided me through the whole process as how and where to obtain a possible aid.It tells about the financial aid package of each and every college and all that needed to estimate your college costs.Another book of the same kind helpful to high school seniors is THE COLLEGE BOARD THE SCHOLARSHIP HANDBOOK 2000. I like both of the books and suggest that every high school should have a copy of them If you also want to search for an aid in the easiest possible way use this book Thank you COLLEGE BOARD
2,Bad toe box design,"I have owned and loved Timberlands since 1994. My last pair was the White Ledge. These appeared to be basically the same boot but with Gore Tex. I loved the white ledges so much that I thought these would be a great upgrade with the Gore Tex lining. Since the outsole is the same and similar lacing. However, there is one design difference and it is a bad one. The the leather of the toe box and the leather strips that the lacing bolts run through, they meet and overlap at the top of the toe box. Since they overlap, it is not as flexible as the surrounding leather, and when you step forward, the extra firm leather digs straight down crushing my toes. I am hoping after more hikes and unfortunately more suffering, they may break in. This is unfortunate and downgrades an otherwise exceptional boot. I wish I would have stayed with the white ledge instead."
4,Rock solid Boot for the Money. Great Value.,"I have had these boots out in the field, on dirt trails, in the mountains, on the river bank, in the boat, and in the snow. These Timberland Men's 15130 Chocurua Trail GTX Boots are holding up really well. They have great interior support and the lining feels great. They tie well and one nearly forgets one is wearing boots. The pattern on the bottom is big enough that a few kicks on the concrete knocks everything off pretty quick. The only negative is that after nearly a year, I am noticing that that the lace eyelets are starting to wear the laces some, which means breakage eventually, but I suppose everything wears out eventually. This one point is why I am not giving it 5 stars though. No regrets on the purchase."
3,Nice boot but odd fit,"These are very nicely made and designed boots. It's getting harder to find these sort of robust metal eyelets. They're waterproof but light and not too warm. I really wanted them to work out. Only problem was the left boot seemed too narrow for a medium and caused some pain just trying them out inside.So I had to return them, and unfortunately ""free returns"" under Amazon Prime apparently means you pay five bucks for the privilege since it was not Amazon's fault that the boots didn't fit. How's that a free return? Zappo's has free returns for real, though their stuff generally costs more. So how's that for a fun, informative and entertaining review?"
1,Poor guality,The seam on the sides of this boot come undone. After 30 miles of hiking the seam where the leather meets the nylon mesh is completely frayed and ripped on all sides. 2 boots with 4 seams that are split wide open. Very comfortable but does you little good when your feet are wet and the boot is actively self destructing. Shame on Timberland for putting this garbage out there.
5,Nice boots,"This is the first pair of decent boots I bought.Even though without much comparison, I would say this is great boots. It's very comfortable and weather proof as well. Less than a month I made the purchase, I wore them to climb Mount Kilimanjaro as well as on an extensive Safari trip in central Africa (Actually that's what I bought them for), it keeps my feet dry and warm in low temperature conditions on the 5000 meters mountain slope. It equally breaths well in the 80 degree African tropical dry lands. and won't smother my feet.I'm glad to make the purchase, now I'm wearing them regularly, both for outdoor hiking and during rainning weather.One thing to keep in mind, If you buy them for hiking purposes, You should always try the boots out in the afternoon and with your hiking socks on, since hiking socks are usually pretty thick than reqular cotton ones, and in the afternoon your feet is larger than in the morning. I wish i bought mine a half size larger."
5,nice shoe,love it i use this shoe for work as a ups driver need very good shoe and this mach my needs
3,"Good boot, but not that great just due to the cost","This is a real solid boot. It's sturdy, the grip is nice and stable, and it is waterproof. You get the feeling that your feet are protected in this boot, and that feeling is really nice.The finishing is also great, and inside the boot, the liners give lot of comfort and cushioning.However, this still is a heavy boot , and does not leave room for your feet to breathe. Your feet is definitely nice and tucked in, but after a while, you start feeling the heat. Might work well for cold climates, but for where I stay, it's hot, and this boot makes me realize that it is indeed hot.This boot would have definitely been a 5 star from me, if it was 20$ less."
2,"Not really waterproof, cruel boots Ouch!","These boots are kind of waterproof but in the most difficult conditions are not. They will keep you feet dry going across a stream, but a half mile through long wet grass will leave you with wet feet.I don't know if this is just me, but they hurt my feet. Given the nature of the construction with a molded EVA last and sole this is a function of the shape as they will never break in. I find that after 3 or 4 miles I just want them OFF! I have tried the factory insole and 2 kinds of orthotics based upon casts of my feet. They hurt no matter what.I read the reviews and everyone said ordering the normal US size was okay. I wear a US 13 and am thinking I should have ordered a 14.If you get these wear them indoors and standing for a few days before deciding to keep them"
4,Good Boots for Hiking and Wet conditions,"They are comfortable, easy to put on, and have decent traction in wet, slippery and/or rocky conditions. They are also good in snow, my feet haven't gotten wet yet and they keep my feet warm. The only downsides are that they mark up easily and the laces that came with it broke about 6 months after buying. There are replacement laces but you can't get the same color that came when you bought it. The guy at the shop says that the metal rings grind down on the laces."
5,Durable,"I purchased this product for my husband who is a Journeyman in the HVAC trade. He needed a product that would stand up to the brutal daily work of a Tradesman, and is also water proof. This is a great product for everyday use in the field."
5,very nice shoes,"This is my first pair of Timberland shoes,very nice feeling ,the shoes are waterproof and size is very ok. really good shoes for hiking."
4,Good shoes,"These are great light weight boots. They keep your feet warm, but not hot. I wear them ever day, and they required no break in period and were quite comfortable right out of the box. One word of advice...these boots are sized smaller than I expected. If you wear a size 10, I would consider ordering a size 11. Other than that, they're just what the Dr. ordered."
2,"Very Comfortable, great looking.... Huge design flaw","I love these boots, I really wish they were designed better. The first time I put on the boots they felt broken in, I wore them all day, and did not take any time to break in. However I don't wear these boots that often. Usually just for rainy days, and in Southern California, that is not very often. After I would say 5-10 days of wearing the boots, the inside fabric on the boot by my arch has started to fray. And not on just one side, but both sides. So it is not an instance where maybe I caught one boot on a nail. The other thing is the eyelets on the boots are starting to fray the laces. I'm not pulling a MacGuyver and using these laces to shimmy down a zip line either, I am lacing up my boots and It is only a matter of time before the laces snap.I will probably send back to Timberland to swap them out, from reading some other reviews it does not sound like an isolated incident."
1,Terrible Quality,"I had them for two weeks that I actually hiked in them and they left my feet soaked just from walking in snow, and the soles are almost completely worn out already. Would not reccomend buying these spend 10-20 dollars more and buy Merrell."
2,boots,"size too big - product should specify country of origin. This item is made in China, I always thought Timberland products were made in USA"
3,Wore Out Shoelaces in One Week,"These fit well, are super comfortable, grip well in snow,and keep my feet dry, but the top metal shoelace eyeletsare poorly designed and wore out the shoelaces within a weekon both boots. I had to replace the thicker ""hiker"" shoelacesthat came with the boots with thinner, sturdier ones."
5,the best boot for the price,"this is my 2nd pair of these same boots. my first pair lasted 6 years. to summarize how i feel about them... they're very comfortable, don't make my feet stink, not ugly, keep the water out and last a long time.... pretty much the perfect boot."
2,totally disappointing,"i purchased these boots for my brother a while back because he only wears Timberlands and couldnt find his size in the local store in our country. they arrived well packaged and all but after a few months of wearing them (total of about 12 wearings) he had he strangest complain in all his time as a Tims fan: the body came loose from the sole!!! so that looking down at the boots your could see a crease all the way round-on both boot.he has never before had this problem and we have concluded that these are quite likely fake :(i definitely wouldnt recommend these to anyone- 'cept to say ""dont buy these"""
2,Timberland Chocoura hiker,"I bought this boot in march 2012. The boot is very comfortable, but the quality of the shoe is very questionable. It is now august 2012 and the boot has begun to unravel where the nylon mesh is stitched to the leather. In the time that I have owned this shoe it has not been worn often or roughly. Maybe I just got a bad boot, I don't know but I won't be buying timberland shoes anymore."
3,Not at good at the old model,"I bought a pair of these boots 3 years ago and they were awesome. I figured the latest model would be even better - boy was I wrong. They're a bit heavier, not as warm and just stiff all around. I thought they may just need some breaking in, but after a month they're still uncomfortable."
4,Great boots but the laces...,"Excelent boots, light, extremely confortable, better than many running shoes I've had in many ways. I don't even remember that I'm wearing boots. But... I've used them just a few times and the strings are already getting torn due to friction against the eyelets. Fear they won't last much..."
4,Timberland Chocurua Boot,"These are very nice boots for the money, they fit true to size, and feel very nice and light on my feet, they dont have a whole lot of padding in the bottom, but that hasnt been a problem. Ive only worn them for about a week now. The only problem I have it when they're laced all the way up the laces tend to slip over the the top of the tongue."
5,great shoes!,"My husband loves these boots. They slip on easy (due to the gortex liner) and are lightweight and flexible. He wears a 14W and they are, indeed, wide enough. Great product."
4,Second Pair,"This is my second pair of Chocorua boots. The first I wore for 2 years hiking, in the snow, and around the yard. They are incredibly comfortable and light. I was happy with the first pair until one of the eyelets broke at the weld. I can still use the boot, but if the lace gets too high, it pulls out of the eye.This pair is solid black and I plan to wear them while working in northern states in the presence of snow and ice."
3,Puckered,"I knew something wasn't quite right when I noticed the right bootlace is 8 inches shorter than the left. No biggie, just odd. The leather uppers, however, don't fit either. The uppers seem to be from a larger last than the lowers fit. This makes the uppers pucker and bulge at the sole. All this said, the boots wear well and are correctly sized, and comfortable. I see why this item is marked down a lot, considering the Gore-Tex: they appear to be seconds."
4,"Good Boots ,Low Cost,","Was surprised they fit so well, my feet are a wide, these are a 11.5 Wide, took a 2.5 mile hike 1st and they were very stable on rocky surfaced gravel type road,up and down some good hills.Flexible, they seem pretty tough enough to last awhile, will have to see. Light weight impressed me, Packaged was very good by Sunny Sports. Will recommend them ,now i have to buy some work type boots , so i can switch off ,i want to keep these just for Hiking!"
2,Quality Issue,"On the plus side, these boots have been very comfortable right out of the box. The break in time was almost zero. Unfortunately there are quality issues with my pair. The seam along the webbing on the side of the shoe came loose after relatively short use. A minor problem has been the laces. The outer sheath broke very quickly after I started wearing the shoes. A nice shoe with some quality issues."
2,Disappointing,"Initially, I was very happy with these, as I have been with Timberland in the past.However, within a few months, 3 or so, the stitching between the canvas and leather (or faux-leather) came apart on both boots. This is unacceptable in a boot from a brand like Timberland for the price. I expect better quality, and will not likely be buying Timberland again anytime soon. I can get better quality cheaper.On the upside, the boots are comfortable...until it rains or snows. Wet feet are NOT comfortable at all, and once the stitching splits, they are no longer waterproof. Haven't had any issues with traction, but as I got them in the spring and they had begun to fall apart by the summer, I have limited experience with them on snow or ice."
5,My husband loved these,"We had found these in store, but was able to compare prices using my amazon app and see that it was $15 cheaper to buy through Amazon. He needed a new pair of ""work boots"" and these fit the bill. They still look nice enough to wear out and about wearing with regular jeans, but give his feet the protection that he wanted. Great shoe!"
5,Just outright amazing. + good price.,"Length:: 0:18 Minscolor Brown/Brown,size 13 M. Fantastic Boots! They are very comfortable. I like to wear them almost 24/7(includes sleeping with them on). I felt so grateful for the quality of my boots I decided to do a review. Haha."
5,Ray's Musical Wheel House,"the Blues is where Ray Charles got His Center base&took his foundation along with adding other elements&Ingrediants to His Musical Stew. His Blend with His various Musicans over the years enhanced His vibe.""Night time is the right time"" is timeless.Ray kept it raw but also but so much feeling into His songs.this collection is a must have.strong arrangements&productions.Ray's Vocal Instrument is Strong here."
3,Not Recommended for Frequent Users,I use my phone with the headset quite a bit. I already have a short in the headset :-( I purchased it for the retracttion feature ... maybe that does not work so well with the fine wiring for headsets especially if ou are a frequent user.
3,"OK, But Not What I Had Hope It Would Be","When I was in law school, I found that the history behind many legal principles and procedures that we use today was quite interesting. I was not able to take an actual course in legal history, however. Years later, I happened across this book and decided to give it a try.The book is OK, but I found it a bit sparse on many topics (even for a nutshell), and the writing was not always very clear. Frankly, my mind would wander while reading, since the book was just not written in a very interesting manner for the most part. Given the history involved, it should be possible to make it more interesting than this I would imagine.If you are looking for a brief introduction to the subject, I would try to find something else if you can. This one is OK, but hopefully there is something out there a bit better."
4,"Teenage Depression, Misery, & Angst - Garage & Psychadelic Rock Style!","Another great and fun collection of obscure garage & psychadelic tracks ... lyrics from FEELIN' BAD, ""Don't feel bad about the Vietnam War, Don't feel bad about the civil rights riots, but I do feel bad about losing you.""That's the right perspective! :-)Of course, if you have a guitar, a friend who can play drum and bass ... and of course, you need a garage to pour your heart out on all the important topics ... the great series continues with heartfelt garage & psych rock ... this one covering teenage depression, misery & angst ... let's rock!"
2,Review,"I found the book to be very light in help to catch trout. Too much devoted to board areas to fish, too little to technique."
4,Touching story,"A mother's love is all t be same, be it animals or humans. As always , the illustrations are beautiful and expressive."
2,Incompatible with my Mac,"I bought this book to read to my nephew at Christmas. It would not play on my Mac (said format not compatible) so I had only my iPhone 4S to use. It would not expand in size (although the print box did slightly) so it was very difficult to read to him as well as engage him in the pictures.It was a good story, though, which was why I gave it a second star."
4,A beautifully illustrated story,"When I ordered this book I thought it would cover Scarlett's story more fully, but believe this book would be more suitable for children.It tells a wonderful story of Mother love and devotion. The illustrations are beautiful, and I will pass it along to my local library for young readers to enjoy.I did order another book about Scarlett, that tells more of her story and what happened after the fire. I believe adults would like that book a little better.There was one thing that was not covered in either book, that was so touching. Scarlett had many scars from her fiery rescue, but her new owner was reported to have sung the song 'You Are So Beautiful"" to her, every day that she lived."
4,"True story, beautifully told",I purchased this book for my 8-year-old grandson and enjoyed the colorful pages and touching story myself. All family members have read the book and appreciated seeing the real mother cat with her kittens on the last page. Anyone can appreciate and admire the dedication and bravery of this animal.
4,Cat prowess,My son and I loved Hero Cat. Such a great story. We have read it 3 or 4 times.Cats are awesome creatures:))
2,MORAL OF THE STORY,This is a good children's book for all ages. My seven year old daughter enjoyed this story because of the animals. But I think the moral of the story is much deeper.
4,Fun book!,Easy to read and interesting. Cats are of great interest to eight year old girls and this true story was spellbinding.
2,Children's Book...not a novel,Thought this was a novel that had a lpng story to it...this took about 2 mins. to look at...more for children.
3,Interesting,I like how the author put us in the cats shoes. I picked three stars because I was expecting more details of the fire.
4,Wonderful heartwarming story of Mother's love,"The kindle version ofHero Catis fine for reading with the enlarged text box. The illustrations are lovely realistic pastels with simple text that a 1st-3rd grade student can easily read. I love happy endings and this story has simple text, a moving story of love and hardship with a happy ending!!"
3,Super Quick Read,I had read about this cat in the newspaper when it happened and was looking forward to reading the book. I was a little surprised how short the story was.
1,Almost Useless,This eBook appears to be a scanned in very basic printed book with only a few pages. The print is tiny and hard to read on my 7 inch tablet. It was difficult to keep the attention of my 4 year old Granddaughter.
2,"Okay story but,....","This could have been a good movie if Robert Shaw hadn't died while they were making it. In Leonard Maltin's review he says that most of Robert Shaw's voice had to be re dubbed. As far as i could hear ALL of it was. It was just too hard to enjoy because it obviously wasn't Robert Shaw's Voice. There are some good performances in this film though. And a good plot. But if you're planning to buy it because you're a fan of Robert Shaw,...Prepared to be dissapointed. I'm sure he gave a good performance but the emotions displayed by the actor who dubbed him were lacking. Sad. Could have been a classic movie if it weren't for that."
4,Fun Pre-Garage - Really Early Alternative Rock,"This one actually feels earlier than the first 5-6 in the series which were top notch garage and early power pop. This one is a fun collection of obscure pre-garage ... really more the first alternative rock - the Buddy Holly/Gene Vincents who didn't quite know how to play their instruments :-)WARNING though - of the entire series, this is the one with a wide quality of the recordings themselves. Some tracks are just acceptable sound quality-wise."
4,Could be good - Might be dated,"If you are downloading older versions of SuSE Linux, this might be good, but SuSE Linux is at SuSE Linux 7.2 now (3 JUL 01), so you might want to look for something newer."
4,What an ending!,"I thought this book was pretty good but the end was a let down. In my opinion, the movie was better."
3,Good. But not great.,"I turn to John Grisham for the same reason I turn to Michael Crichton. Generally, when I'm looking for a relaxing read -- something that won't require too much thought or stress -- I pick up Grisham. ""The Firm"" did not by any means disappoint -- it provided the mystery and intrigue that I hoped to find in it. It was, however, a bit tedious in spots. Perhaps the miserable attempt at turning it into a movie damaged my view of the book. In short, the book is worth the time to read it, but don't expect to be blown away by it."
3,Still an enjoyable read,"The plot is similar to ""The Associate"" - rookie lawyer, a firm with dirty business, the works.John Grisham is quite a storyteller of legal thrillers. He has a way to get even non-lawyers understand whatever it is that needs to be understood about the law and its practice; with all the elements of a bestseller to go with it.With quite a number of his books on my ""read"" list, the ending was a giveaway but still, I very much enjoyed the suspense. I even wished I was not going on a date with my husband on the night I knew I'd finish the book, but the Mafia is no match to him :D"
4,The book that made me a reader!,Let's be clear... this is not his best book. I like Time to Kill and The Pelican Brief better... (fiction) and Innocent Man(non-fiction) is a MUST READ to understand how scary the judicial system is in this country! BUT...I read this book in 1992... shortly after graduating from college... my roommate had it on the coffee table... and the first hundred pages are as enticing a beginning as any book I've ever read. I stayed up til 5 in the morning to finish it. It made me realize how fun and intriguing fiction books can be. How great a simple writing style can make you want to read more. It's a page turner. The movie doesn't do it justice and the ending is different anyway. This book made a reader out of me.
2,The Firm [Audible Audio Edition] narrated by Scott Brick,"This probably would have been a great audiobook if not for Scott Brick. His voice is not terrible but he tries to read every single sentence with a dramatic intonation. You just can't do that. Not every sentence in a book is meant to be dramatic. It's the equivalent of an actor overacting. He frequently makes the dialog sound strange and forced due to the almost nonstop emphasis he tries to add. I would give this novel 3 stars (maybe it could have been 4 stars with a different narrator) and I give the narration 1 star for an average of 2 stars. This book is definitely worth the listen, just try to find a different copy."
5,This was my first John Grisham read,"Being my first book of his to read, it's left a lasting impression all these years later. I do not even know if I still have the paperback. It's not in my bookshelf. I started re-reading this book at a friend's house but didn't ask to borrow it. Now I'm hooked back in it but left hanging because I don't have a physical copy of it. I thought I'd just get it on my Kindle. I'm pretty disappointed to see the price for the Kindle edition is $10. I understand the price is set by the publisher but it's still a disappointment. I won't buy the Kindle edition because of the price and the fact that I've already purchased the book once. I'm going to look in a box of books I have stored. I hope I find it because this book truly is worthy of a re-read. If anyone hasn't read this book by now, it's high time you did!"
4,Even better than the series,I saw the unfinished tv series based on this novel and regret that they stopped before it was finished. This book was as thrilling and even better than the series.
4,A masterpiece by the master !!!,"As mentioned in the title of this review, this is another masterpiece by the master storyteller. John has a languid, easy-going style of writing which is at once engrossing and laid-back at the same time. The elite college-goer, college-goers who are madly in love, the middle rung executive, executives who have faced job pressures in their lives and bored housewives shall immediately identify with the story as it unfolds. John's powers of observation and his manner of penning them is astounding, to say the least. There are twists and turns throughout the story and the novel unwittingly reveals a number of ways in which, not only can money be stashed away but loopholes in the law/system exploited as well. John's take on the Cayman Islands is a given. This is one un-put-dow-nable and re-re-readable novel!!!!"
4,great book,"i am 14 years old and i always wanted to be a lawyer who makes tons of money. after reading this book, i am now aware on how the world actually is. i loved this book and ive told many of my friends that they shoud also read it. john grisham is a great writer. i normally dont finish books, but after reading the first sentence, i couldnt put the book down."
5,One of Grisham's finest...,"This is easily one of Grisham's best novels. It is about a Harvard law student who gets woooed to a small Memphis firm. Before too long he realizes that the firm is really a front for a money laundering scheme for the Mob. Now Mitch has to run for his life to stay ahead of the FBI and the Mob.This book is very easy to read, the chapters are realatively short. There were a few times I had trouble putting it down. I really didn't understand a few sequences in the book. Like the afair Mitch had with a woman in the Caymans and his brother really didn't have a real role in the story. Overall, this is a great book. I recommend this book to anyone."
1,impossible,"After having the book on the shelf for allmost a year I tried to read it when I had some spare time. I didn't like it at all. It is badly written , and the plot has a lot of ommissions. When it was obvious for the first time to the firm that Mitch tried to speak to the FBI they decided to let him live! I thought the mob was ruthless? The end of the story was very bad and to me, after the preparations the writer made in the first part of the book, a disappointment. I also had the feeling I was looking at a soap. If I skipped a few pages, I knew instantly what had happened in the skipped pages. When books are good, I'd like to read them more. I don't have the feeling with this book."
1,"Disappointing, to put it mildly","My first Grisham book. My last. Oh, I didn't buy the book; I borrowed it. Thank God!Boring. Unbelievable plot. Flat characters. How a brilliant top-notch lawyer can get suckered up to this firm shows the effort Grisham had put in his characters.....Don't read it! It's got no entertainment value or literary content."
1,Predictable all the way through,"You read the book jacket and you know the whole story. Except for a small bit at the end of the book, there is nothing clever or original. There are no surprises or turns. Everything is very predictable. The book just goes through motions."
1,John Grisham REALLY stinks,"I know I'll get flamed for this, but I just have to get it off my chest. After reading ""The Firm"" and ""A Time to Kill"" I have come to the conclusion the Grisham is one of the worst writers ever to top the bestseller list. ""The Firm"" starts out plausibly, but then goes totally haywire at about the two-thirds mark with an ending as believable as your average romance novel. If Grisham was as good an attorney as he is a writer, there'd be a lot more people on death row."
1,cry for help,"John Grisham has reached almost unprecedented heights in recent years with his slick legal thrillers, but he loses the plot entirely here. Science fiction romantic comedies are never done for the simple reason they don't work. Give Grisham credit, he tries something off the beaten path here but it all goes horribly wrong after a few chapters. without revealing the plodding plot, nothing is going on here !! Two people sitting in a small closet talking quietly to each other may make for riviting German arthouse film, but in book form all it induces is a zombie like state. Even the mandatory surprise twist at the end fails to awaken the slumbering reader. Not recommended by this particular reader."
5,The Best,"Quite simply, the best book I have ever read. It's quite a cliche, but I just could not put it down.If you have seen the movie and don't see any reason to read the book, please reconsider. The book and movie follow each other closely for awhile, but after that, the plots skew and the book ends up being very different. I was shaking my head almost the whole time at the movie. The book is so much better.Read it!"
4,IT'S A MUST!,"THE FIRM is absolutly a great book. No, fantastic would be theright word. I just couldn't put it down until I saw the ending, so Iread it 'til 4 A.M.! But I was so excited that I didn't even feel sleepy. During the book, I almost felt like I was Mitch, running away from the Mob, not knowing what to do. I wonder how I would have acted if I was in that situaution. Would I have acted bravely and clever like Mitch? Or... Well, I hope so. But the reason I rated this book 8 instead of 9 or 10, even though I liked it so much, is because of the ending. I saw the movie(featuring Tom Cruise), and I think its ending was much better. But although I didn't like the ending, it's a great book. I'm a middle school student in Korea, so I'm not very good at English(you would know it by reading my review), but it was no problem. For anyone who didn't read it yet, I say it's a MUST!"
3,If you look at the bio's for all Grisham books....,"If you look at the bios for all Grisham books, what should jump out at you is that John Grisham started with The Firm, and used that as a shell for all of his later books. Yes, they are good reads, but all of his books are THE SAME. What they lack creativity, Grisham tries to make up with a superb knowledge of the legal system. This, like most Grish books, is for those who are interested in the innerworkings of our legal systems, not for those who are looking for a stimulating read."
3,Legal Thriller,"When a Memphis law firm makes Mitch McDeere an offer he can't refuse, he jumps in, only later to learn that no one has ever left the firm on his own terms. The pace is fast, the characters interesting and the story is entertaining, but the ending is a little flat. A good, quick read. Having seen the movie before I read the book, I think Grisham should put his legal skills to use and sue Sydney Pollack for the lousy film adaptation of his novel."
4,I Was Confused?,"I have to admit, in this case, I saw the movie before I read the book. With a few exceptions of likeness, it was difficult to believe the movie and the book were related. Why do authors allow their writings to be so mutilated? I wish I had read the book first. John Grisham is truly my favorite author. I'm very anxious to read his very latest."
4,Top Thriller,"This is a great book that is full of mystery and excitement. It is about this new young lawyer that got picked to be in the best firm in the US. This firm is great with a starting salary of $75,000 and a $5,000 bonus when you pass the bar and you get raises like crazy. That isnt all the get you a great deal on a house and how about a brand new BMW you get to pick the color of course. How much better can life get. One catch though you can only leave the firm in a coffin. That is right everyone that has ever tried to leave the firm is dead. Now it is up to Mitch and the FBI to bring this firm down which they also find out is part of the Mafia. This book is full of mystery and excitement i recommend to any person intrested in Grisham."
4,The first half of the book is great!,"I know this is the book that launched Grisham's career as a bestselling author and I can remember everyone having a copy (like The Da Vinci Code). I even got sucked in by the first half of this book (top law school student gets sucked into small southern law firm with incredible perks and a lot of intrigue). Just based on this I gave it four stars. What left me cold and prevented me from saying yes the hype is real and thus giving the book five stars is the second half. Out of nowhere the young lawyer turns into someone out of Mission Impossible (is that why Tom Cruise played the part in the movie?) and figures out everything and gets the goods on the bad guys. This trend continued in The Pelican Brief. Frankly, I think Grisham's later books were much better (The Client, The Chamber, A Painted House). However, if you don't mind the improbability of the second half of this book then you will probably give it five stars."
4,EXCELLENT,I thought this book was excellent. When you start readingit is hard to put the book down. The book really draws youin when the FBI gets involved and McDeere's (the main character)life is at stake. Though I think the Client (also by Grisham)was better written I would suggest this book to anyone assuperb book.
5,One of my five all-time favorites,"Readers, put your answering machine on, send the kids to Grandma's, and settle in for the ""read"" of your life. I've recommended this book to everyone from my 68-year-old mother to my husband to my co-workers. They all loved it as much as I did. Once poor Mitch realized he was between a rock and a hard place, wild horses couldn't tear me away. I've read all Grisham's books up through ""Rainmaker"" but this was my first and my favorite of his work. I saw the movie and loved it too. The niftiest part of that was that the movie ended differently from the novel, and it was just different enough to keep me guessing. A classic both in print and on the silver screen"
3,"What can you expect from a ""law thriller""?","Mitch McDeere is a law student straight our of Harvard. He immediately gets an offer from a hush-hush law firm in Memphis, which, as he later finds out himself is controlled by the Mob (and laundering billions of dollars every year). The offer is good, with a lot of money, nice company car, etc.Mitch soon finds himself engulfed between the FBI and the law firm, knowing that he very well might be killed by the Mob if he says too much.This book is certainly the most interesting ""law thriller"" that I have ever read (the only one, too) but 3 stars is the most any book about tax law suspense can get."
2,Thin characterization,"I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time."
5,Gripping and Entertaining,"You will not put this book down. It captures you and you struggle to put the book down and go to bed. The intense plot with no let up will keep you at the edge of your seat for hours. The beginning though, I must admit is a bit slow. But once you get into the heart of the story, too slow won't be an issue.Grisham's writing style allows you to read the sentence on the page, feel that you are there, and also make it believable. Many writers can't do that in their thrillers. The author writes it in a way where you know that it wouldn't happen and it takes you out of the story and drops the suspense. But Grisham writes so well that you feel that you are in the story and you start to worry and feel emotions.A real thriller that keeps you on your toes."
5,My View on the book The Firm,"From a decisive point of view The Firm is one of the best books I have ever read, and I would recommend it to anybody who loves to read. I have the benefit of reading this book. I enjoyed the parts when he wrights in a fast pace style, which occurs throughout most of the book. I also like his use of the central character as a highly regarded lawyer who is faced with the circumstances of spying on his firm for the FBI. I also like how he at first portrays the firm to be well thought-of then as the book progresses he changes your vision on it. Despite the fact that before I started to read the novel the span discouraged me it was well worth it in the end."
4,Wealth and Trust,"""He was their top choice. In fact for this year there were no other prospects. The list was very short. It was Mcdeere or no one"" (pg 2). The Firm by John Grisham is a wonderful book about a lawyer fresh out of Harvard expecting money and extravagances. This book plays on every whim of a realist's imagination. Mitch McDeere, the main character, becomes entangled in a fantasy life as a lawyer in a very wealthy firm called Bendini, Lambert, and Lock. Money, cars, vacations, work, Mitch is given the life of luxury. The only setback is a mysterious death of some of the company's associates. But almost as quickly as he was swept into his dream the FBI pulls him out, when he finds that his wonderfully rich law firm is corrupt and sketchy. In further examination of his surroundings, Mitch finds his life threatened by mobsters associated with the firm. This great book holds your attention and keeps your imagination reeling."
1,"Really, really, really quite bad","Considering Grisham wrote this book to be into a movie, no wonder the movie was better. I give this book one star because it provides more purgative power than staring blankly at the wall for two hours."
5,The Firm,This book was great. I was surprised by how easy it was to get into and how it kept me interested the whole way through. It was one of the few books that I have read that I found impossible to put down. All of the action in the book kept me reading and made me feel like I got to know all of the characters - now I want to know what will happen for Mitch and Abby.
5,It's an excellent book!!,An excellent book which teaches a lot about own respect and honesty. I am an English teacher in a South American country and I am convincing my director to have it read by our 12th grade students. It will be great for them. I also have the movie and it's very good too. The only thing I don't get it is why they changed the end of the story.
5,The Firm was a book that I could not stop reading,The Firm is so exciting John Grisham leaves you hanging on each chapter and you just can't stop reading it until your eyes get tired. I hope that John Grisham makes a sequel for it. I know I would buy it on its first day of sales.
3,Unsatisfying ending,'The Firm' starts out very good and seems to be very interesting. But I was very disappointed by the ending and I think it ruined the story. I don't think the ending was logical and I was even rooting for the FBI and the Mafia to catch Mitch.
3,Good plot driven tale with some resolution problems,"The Firm is a well written book; well paced, plotted, and imaginative. However, it is plot driven as opposed to character driven."
4,HIs Best,"This is Grisham's best and only good book--except the Rainmaker, which is well done and with a few good characters. The Firm was one of the best novels of 1992, but his books have down hill from there, for the most part. If you want Grisham at his best this is good as he gets."
4,Great Book!!,"The story of a young student out of law school who could have any firm in the country but choose lowly Bendini, Lambert, and Locke. The FBI enters the scene and reveals the truth to the young, bright Mitch McDeere."
3,It's predictable and similar to The Client,"This book, the firm, holds you on suspense... until about the middle of the book, where you realise what will happen. Yes, the code names and the delaying of information does make the book a bit more interesting. But, when I read The Firm, I noticed a very large similarty to The Client. If anyone would like to discuss this with me, feel free to E-mail me"
4,Suspense!,Loved how we knew the characters intimately before the chase began. Hung on every word of the book. Great job!
4,Amazing!!,"This was an incredible story. Lots of twists and turns, but Grisham did a great job of putting it all together to make sense. Thoroughly enjoyed!!!!"
5,things are not as we like them to be,"This is my first Grisham's book and I found it very exciting. It's full of action, suspense, and lot of twists. It's very well written, and the characters are very real. Some people say that there were some parts very predictable, but I think that is very difficult to an author to write a book where no one can figure out what comes next, but I think that Grisham did a great job, because there were some parts that I assure you, you didn't see that coming. I enjoyed this book so much that I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the others Grisham's books. You won't regreat reading this one. And it give you something to remember forever: all that glitters is not gold, or as Ray would say: No todo lo que brilla es oro."
3,Legal thriller a fun read but not so believable,"This book keeps your attention but is somewhat contrived. It was hard to envision the characters as real people. I stopped counting how many times Grisham used the word ""perfect"" or ""perfectly"" or something like it. He made everyone seem like a precision instrument. Read it for the sake of the thrill, but don't expect much else.As for the ending, I left with the thought that I would rather be one of the indicted associates who serves a few years in prison, than Mitch McDeere who serves the rest of his life, in fear of death, on a deserted isle with nothing to do but think about (there's nothing on which to spend) the millions he misappropriated from his client. Of course, I guess he can drink Red Stripe all day and have sex with his wife, and maybe that prostitute on the other island. So maybe it's not such a bad life, mon.By the way, speaking as a lawyer, this book has nothing to do with the practice of law."
1,Very poor service,"I received this book without a book jacket and a worn binding. When I emailed Mandy Kramer about this, she indicated that I should have read the description. I went back and looked at the description and it said ""NEW"". I emailed her with this information and she again replied that I should have read the description. Finally after a third time, she said I can return the book at my expense and she will credit my account. It cost $8.54 to return the book. I paid $10.99 originally. Now she has the book and I doubt that I will get my $10.99 back.Stay away from Mandy Kramer!!!"
3,It was O.K.,"The entire premise of the story seemed contrived to me. A law firm in a city the size of Memphis can't lose that many employees without attracting attention. I also do not feel that this author paints a picture of his protagonist as for example, Michael Connelly or James Patterson do. I won't be reading any more of this autor's books"
2,Movie's better...,"Never before, and likely never again will I read one of Grisham's works of fiction. It had never been much of a priority to do so in the first place, but I only decided to after watching the movie several times. I always suspected that the writing wasn't good, and I was right. Some of the changes made in the movie version were unfortunate, but thankfully the ending was refined. I found the conclusion of the novel to be much too drawn out and tedious -- not suspenseful at all."
1,"Please, John . . . no more!","I had every intention of liking this book. Good reviews and personal recommendations prompted me to buy the thing. Thankfully I bought it in paperback (they burn easier). I have never been so disappointed by a novel in my life . Grisham's boring attention to meaningless detail is equalled only by the flatness of the characters he created for ""The Firm"". It is as dry and unliterary as a history book. Where is the symbolism, the allegory, the things that make books interesting? Not here, my friend."
4,what up with race?,"This book seems to be really good, but there is a constant reoccuring talk about the number of white people. At the Manhattan Club, all of the diners were rich, established. And white. In Nashville, it was safe. And all white faces. Dang! The only mention of Black people where the cooks at the firms and delievery guys. John seems to like to point out race-especially when he is talking about status. What is the point? Is John prejudice or something? Don't buy the book if you are senstive to race. Borrow it from the library-but don't support the author financially."
1,Awful,"I think Grisham took a word processor, smeared banana on its keyboard, then put it in a locked room with a chimpanzee. The chimpanzee then proceeded to hit the keys when trying to get at the smeared banana...and this is the book that resulted. There is no other explanation for so bad a book having been written, much less published. I hope that chimpanzee got a cut of the royalties."
1,Mindnumbing,This is a book for people who neither like to read nor to think. The plot is extremely formulaic. I was surprised at no point during the narrative. The dialogue was laughably bad and unrealistic. His idea of Caribbean culture was taken from a travel ad. His slobberingly loving descriptions of the main character's designer name possessions reflect the worst aspects of mindless 80's materialism. The fact that so many Americans were vapid enough to buy and love this book saddens me.
2,"Sorry, I did not like it!","I bought this book when it was first published, and I did not lke it. I read also the Italian translation, and I did not like it. I watched the movie, and I did not like it ( I am not a fan of Tom Cruise, do you believe it?). The characters are all stereotypes, there is no originality, and I finally found out all the story a bit boring."
2,The Firm - an insult to American Literature,"How on earth a story with so many obvious holes could have launched Grisham's career is beyond me. From a legal standpoint the plot lacks credibility. And as usual with Grisham's novels, the protagonist wires a bit of money around the globe and makes instant millions - Deus ex Machina - what a cop out! The Firms ends ridiculously with Mitch and his wife 'hiding out' a couple of miles from where the Mafia blew up two of the firm's lawyers. Dumb or what? Its not all bad though. The life of a workaholic rookie lawyer is well crafted, as is the greed of the partners. But all in all the story sucks. Pass on it."
3,"Great start, good middle...","I read ""The Firm"" at the height of its popularity and felt as if I were a player in the old tale of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". It starts out well - I was hooked. The middle had some nice twists, but then it really sagged about 2/3 of the way through. Am I the only one that found holes in Grisham's story? The chase up and down the coast was boring at best and the ending... well, a little hard to believe after having been convinced of the protagonist's incredible drive to succeed and be recognized."
2,Why bother?,"Sure, sometimes you want ""beach reading"" and sometimes it's okay to read something that reads like a screenplay -- like when you're reading a screenplay. But here, the least our author could have done is give us more than a conclusory ""they made it"" to finish the BIG CHASE SCENE. Hollywood was smart to throw all that out, start over, and come up with something better."
2,Why Does Everyone Love This Book? Boring!!!,"John Grisham sure turned out a stinker in this book, but for some reason people seem to like it. The Firm starts out by giving obvious clues (not just to the reader, but to the young lawyer) that his new employers aren't exactly above-board. How he can be such a brilliant young man and not see the clues is beyond me. He gets suckered in, and as it finally dawns on him that he works for the Mob, they start pushing him to do things he shouldn't, and are completely out of character. Most of the things he did seemed ""realistic"" enough, but his beach tryst was nothing more than a plot device. This is the one Grisham book that I would not recommend to anyone"
4,exciting and entrancing,"This was my first ever Grisham book, and it is definitely not going to be my last. I loved this book. And I would recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't a Grisham fan, or someone who loves courtroom drama (which there isn't much of anyway). It's the story of Mitch McDeere, a new lawyer employed by a seemingly perfect law firm until he discoveres the Mob is behind the firm. The book is about his grappling with what to do concerning the FIB, the mob, and his friends at the firm.I truly enjoyed this book, it made me want to keep reading. Grisham's writing is witty and never boring.Since I read The Firm, I have dove into ""The client"" which I am enjoying, however I enjoyed The Firm more.Read this book, you'll love it!"
3,Not The Best John Grisham Book I've read!,"This book starts out smoothly and finishes, well, not so smoothly. This book about Mitch McDeere and his job at a Mafia-run law firm-and it's pretty good at making the reader love the book for suspense and such, but I didn't really like the ending at all. For those of you who have not read the book, go and buy another John Grisham book, anyone but this one. I think I might have liked it A LOT more if Mitch McDeere had cooporated with the FBI (Don't worry, that line won't give away the book.) It's an okay book, but if you don't want to waste time with so-so books, go read something else!"
3,Grisham knows how to plot. Too bad he can't write!,"How many times have we read the review, ""it's the next FIRM."" Was this book really that great? Sure, it's entertaining...but where's the depth? Mitch and Abby are recycled characters from any suspense thriller, and the ending is lethargic and disappointing. Have you noticed that every John Grisham novel ends the same way...with some character fleeing or entering the witness protection program. He should just kill them all. Of course he wouldn't. Then, Hollywood may not purchase the rights"
5,This started the snowball that is John Grisham,"This was Grisham's first novel and changed the landscape of legal thriller's!! Turow and Lescroart are the only two that EVEN COME CLOSE to Grisham!This story about a poor lawyer college student all set to graduate is great; it has shady secrets, partners that suddenly die, action, suspense, and a little romance thrown in. It is just a fun and entertaining read; perfect for the beach in summer time on vacation.Grisham writes with a clear and concise voice, has a razor-sharp wit, smooth plot, and of of course plenty of action and thrills with a surprise twist of an ending.Two thumbs way up for the modern master of legal thrillers!!"
4,Very entertaining!,"Had read this when it was first published, and was thrilled back then! At that time I had no idea I will also one day end up being a lawyer; re-read it once I had earned my Bar license, and loved it all over again. Tremendous!"
2,"too much, too soon","The book is gripping at the start with its theme of a mysteriously sinister law firm, but Grisham reveals everything too soon rather than let the suspense build. From then on its just a thriller, with the good guys in white hats and bad guys in black. It would have been nicer if there had been some surprises - some bad guys turn out to be heros, that king of thing."
4,John Grisham's best work!,This Book is one of John Grishams Best Works. It is about a young lawyer who joiins a firm. THis law firm is not an ordinary firm. They have his lines tapped. They also give him great benefits. They gradually rope him in so much that it becomes extremely difficult for him to get out. Pretty soon the F.B.I gets invovlved and ... you'll have to read the book for your self.
3,Love the world of Grisham. One word. Entertainment.,Super Entertainer.Great book to take with you on a holiday.A de-stressed and fun read for any mood.Love Grisham!
4,Another good Grisham,"A well narrated story about a firm that is too good to be true. For those who just want a light read based on a generally predictable plot, this Grisham is a good choice."
5,The Firm,"The Firm written by John Grisham is a magnificent read. This is a book you can sit and read in one day without stopping the suspense of the book is exhilarating. Grisham uses many characters in his novel. The main character in this novel Mitch is a young lawyer fresh out of law school and wanted by all the top Firms in the nation. His job leads him to discover things about his Firm that are very confidential and very dangerous. As the book progresses on the F.B.I. contacts Mitch and he is faced with an ethical decision of what to do. This book is a terrific read. I have read all of John Grisham's novels and this is by far my favorite and the most exciting. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a wonderful. If you like fast paced books and an action packed novel this one is for you. The book deals with love, money, and ethical decisions portrayed through the main character Mitch."
4,Page turner,"Another great one from John. Initial chapters are slow, but surely sets up things for later. Once Mitch talks to FBI, u will not keep the book down"
4,Great book.,A young lawyer straight out of law school goes to work for a law firm that turn out to be crooked. This is the story of how he gets out of trouble after his timesheets are altered by the firm in turn making him suspect. This is a gripping tale that leaves you dangling then lashes back with force. I loved it.
4,The book that put John Grisham on the map,"This is a very well plotted book. It is one that is impossible to put down and will have you up late at night finishing it. It was the first of all the Grisham books that I have read, and it is still his best."
5,Edge of your seat!!,"I had never read a book by Grisham until the Firm and i am hooked. It was like the best movie i ever saw, only it was in my mind. I could not put the book down. The last 100 pages of the book captivated my mind and i had to finish it. You must read this book."
5,a fast-pacing novel,"I've read a lot of John Grisham's work and I have to say that this is the best so far....The plot was quite simple: Mitch McDeere, a poor & a fresh graduate from Harvard with a law degree signed up with a wealthy firm that gave out a BMW, a large salary and other things no one can easily acquire...Little did he know that the firm was a business of a Mafia Organization...So now, the FBI and the Mafia's chasing him, his wife and his brother.If you're looking for a good suspense, chasing, easy-to-read book, you better read this NOW!"
4,Exciting page turner,"Ok, the movie really let me down, but this is a book review of course on the book that launched Grisham. Assuming that you haven't read Grishom yet my advice; read 'A Time to Kill' first. The Author wrote that first and I think it is a better way to get into his mind and style. The intial printing of his first book was small, so most people read Firm first, as did I, but I really think as good as this one is, 'A Time to Kill' is more personal, more emotional and is really a better story.The Firm is a solid story with plently of action and suspense and should be read along with the 'Pelican Brief', 'The Client' and 'A Time to Kill' before you read 'The Runaway Jury' and 'The Rainmaker' only because I think the latter two wouldn't be quite as fun as they are without a good base on how Grisham writes and thinks."
3,Grisham at his finest,"The best Grisham book, which is like saying ""the blandest falafel""--a bit incongruent. Of course, to each his own.Not to say I don't enjoy a bland falafel from time to time. In fact, Grisham is best when fried. He certainly knows how to twist a plot, build some decent suspense and help people feel vindicated in their lawyerphobia.So, if you're going to read a lawyer novel, try this one. It's a page-turner. Don't read too much into my falafel comments; there are plenty of falafel fans out there."
3,Emily's Review,"This was a pretty good book. The main plot is about a man named Mitch McDeere who is fresh out of law school, takes a job at a firm. The firm gets Mitch a BMW, a house, and a very high salary. But there seems to be more to this firm than its showing. And when Mitch discovers something he's not supposed to know, he's in a race for his life. I recommend this book for people who like chases, the police, and the danger of secrecy."
2,READ ANOTHER GRISHAM NOVEL - ANY OTHER ONE,"This book started out well, Grisham can definitely write well and create characters. What he fails at is convincing stories from time to time. Don't get me wrong I like most of his stuff, but this one is WEAK. The wet behind the ears lawyer takes on these evil all powerful experienced lawers and they never know? He goes off to the Bahamas with file after file like a cowboy??? Everyone else would just call the FBI and turn over the evidence. By page 50 the character becomes cardboard and the evil guys toddlers. Read ""King of Torts"" or ""The Client"" first. Those books are much better and worthy of praise this one is not."
3,The Firm,"The book The Firm, written by John Grisham, is a powerful and intriguing novel filled with mystery and suspense. I would recommend this book to people who like John Grisham and people that like a lot of foreshadowing in their books. I really think this a great book to read if you're into mystery and murder. This is a book that can really get you hooked. It doesn't tell you much in the beginning, but it gurantees you a great ending. I'm glad I ended up reading this book. It's not usually a book that I would ever pick up and read. I promise anyone who reads this book will have something good to say about it."
3,Nice but not the best,"Read this 1991 book for the first time recently. Very nice gripping story and still realistic today (like FBI is still not-so-smart). Somehow I was not too thrilled with the way it ended. Mitch, character grew too bold, that seemed out of place."
1,"beware of all ""on the rock trail"" dvds","this is the worst thing going. some guys on here giving it 5 stars. somethings wrong here , he should be removed . do not buy this"
1,Wow.,"...and not ""wow"" in the good way. I was amazed at how HORRIBLE this DVD was. I couldn't even sit through the whole thing. I HIGHLY reccommend NOT buying it. Save yourself the 55 minutes. This DVD sucks beyond belief."
1,garbage,First the program failed to load on my laptop so I tried my desk top it would load and walk thru to tutorial and that is all duing the actual corse it crashed my computor at every prompt requireing a complete restart of my computer I wan't my money back
3,Reality TV took over!,"I've been reading People Magazine since the early 80s, so I know I'm not in the demographic they're aiming at any more. It's turned into LOTS and LOTS of reality TV coverage of non-actors, along with very young new actors and musicians, with very limited coverage of established actors. It seems to me they cover a smaller range of people than they used to. I'm telling myself that I""m not going to renew my subscription, but I'm still reading every issue, just skipping the articles about people from shows I would never watch. Their reviews of books and movies are perhaps worth the price of the magazine, and aren't available on their website.If you're interested in reality TV and very young actors and pop musicians, you'll love this mag."
5,Great gift for your wife,I purchased this magazine for my wife and our anniversary.It was like hitting Bingo.Great gift for your wife
3,Incomplete Review,The service works well. The magazine was received as promised. I have marked this review as incomplete because I haven't tried to stop the auto renewal yet. Many times stopping an auto renewal is a hassle. We'll see. Besides that renewals seem to be early. Since it is electronic I'd think they could renew in real time rather than 2 months early.
1,PEOPLE MAGAZINE,"THIS MAGAZINE, WHICH I ONCE ENJOYED, IS DREADFUL - BORING, DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE OF NO INTEREST TO ME. OF COURSE, I HAVE ONLY RECEIVED THREE ISSUES, BUT I WILL DEFINITELY NOT RENEW, AND I AM ONLY SORRY THAT I SPENT A DIME ON IT. THIS WAS ONCE A TERRIFIC MAGAZINE. AS A FORMER TIME MAGAZINE EMPLOYEE, I AM SAD TO SEE HOW FAR ""PEOPLE"" HAS FALLEN. GLOSSY, BUT VAPID."
3,Never on time,I would not order People magazine again. It never comes on time. Used to come on Fridays before you could by it on the newstands. Now it comes on Mondays. I know people will blame it on the mail but I believe they just dont get it mailed in time. The mail hasn't changed. I get everything else in a timely fashion its just my magazine thats late every week. Disappointing.
4,People Mag,Got this for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. She particularly likes the fact that she gets it before it hits the news stands.
4,Pleased with People,The magazine shipped faster than the estimated date...It was the best price for a 6 month subscription...Overall pleased with my purchase
2,head's great but the hardware is falling apart.,"This was a real luxury purchase for me. The shower head is great. But, 3 years later, the 'enamel' which is really plastic, on the handle control has fallen apart. The control itself pops off easily. I expect more."
4,A very enjoyable mystery,"As I read this excellent book, I kept thinking, ""I hope the author doesn't ruin a great mystery by having the female ""detective"" withhold evidence from the police and go off to meet one of the suspects in a dark alley. (Don't you hate it when authors have allegedly intelligent characters do incredibly stupid things?) There is a little of the amateur-detective-does-something-stupid at the climax, but not enough to prevent me from looking forward to the next book in what I hope will be a long and successful series. The book is set in Victorian England. The amateur detectives are a wealthy Englishman, Sir Charles, and an independent-minded American woman who goes to England to take a job as secretary to her wealthy aunt. The characters are enjoyable, the setting is enjoyable, the writing is superb."
3,Death at Bishops Keep,"I'm not sure about this one....I like the people but didn't fall in love with the characters so not sure if I will buy more of this series. I LOVE Susanna Gregory, Michale Jecks, Deanna Raybourn, the Medieavel Murderers etc but also enjoy Teashop Mysteries and the Beatrix Potter series so I like a whole range of books but I just couldn't sink my teeth into this one. Might try another when it starts getting colder and I have more weekend reading time."
4,Great Book (with usual 1st in series issues),"This is the first book in a really great series. Be prepared for a longer exposition as they have to establish the new character but once this is done, the book takes off and a great series begins.I am a huge fan of British mysteries and this Victorian era series is being added to my list of favorites that include the Brenna Taylor series by Jo Hiestand and the MC Beaton Agatha Raisin series. I just ordered four more books and can't wait to snuggle up with a new one and a cup of something warm!"
3,A bit verbose; problems with Kindle formatting,"Given the era in which it was written, the language is a bit overblown but not intolerably so. However, the formatting is a continual challenge. The tale is interesting but be prepared to adjust the font size every couple of chapters."
4,Thoughts of a scotsman,"I have found this book extremely interesting from the point of view of total lack of knowledge of what actually went on in Africa at that time and the very difficult conditions encountered by those who chose to venture into such an inhospitable continent. As if the conditions were not enough to contend with there were also the natives with their requirements in order to pass through ""their land"". Sounds a bit like how things are today!!! Having said that I found it written in the very much journalistic form rather than as a novel. I now note this was the purpose of the writing in general.All in all a very good and enlightening read."
3,Difficult dated delivery,"Difficult read due to archaic language and geography. This could be a worthwhile project to update the language and geography to modern usage. Many of the allusions used are not available in either Kindle dictionary. Only a few of the place names are recognizable. The telling of what was probably a pretty epic trek is swallowed up by a rather wordy narrative. Stanley was a newspaperman whose style of prose did not convert well to the novel. Many of the individual events related are fascinating, it is the flow of events that is bogged down in some of the endless swamps of his telling."
3,Racial overtones undermine this book.,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I love armchair adventure stories and this was one of the classics. The book itself is very nicely done: illustrations and maps supplement the story well. However, Stanley's egotistical and racist behavior, whether an exaggeration for Victorian audiences or not, made the book less enjoyable. When he meets Livingston near the end, the focus of the book shifts. This makes it much finer reading. Although I think that everyone should read this book because of its historical significance in the age of exploration, you may not find it to be a pleasant read front to back."
4,detailed read,many interesting details of the trip into central africa.real documentation of what was required and the thinking of an explorer of the time.would have been a 5 rating if there was a map to follow along with the progress of the journey.
3,An Okay Adventure Story,"This book was written by and about one of the world's greatest explorers and his adventures in Africa.If you are interested in similar travels through Africa, then I suggest Elephant Hunting in East Equatorial Africa by Arthur Neuman or Bell of Africa by W.D.M. Bell.How I found Livingstone is okay but it pales in comparison to those other two books. (Just like every other book of non-fiction.)"
5,Quick upgrade,I was running 4 ohm speakers on tiny cables. They were pretty long to boot. Replaced them with this and no problems. Couldn't bother price shopping for the 20' I needed. I knew these would work.Very flexible.Jeff
2,Buy the extended warranty!!!!,Initially the tv was ok. The picture and resolution were decent. The TV comes with a one year warranty. I'm 18 months in and the panel has apparently blown leaving me with a permanent black bar through the middle of the screen. What's worse is Gateway is aware of this problem yet offers no solution and no support. The tv has been rendered worthless and I'm now shopping for a new (non-Gateway) model.
1,Highland Turmoil,If you are a Linda Howard fan DO NOT BUY THIS BOOKIt is not by Linda but someone called Stephanie HowardBe careful with lots of others on this site becauseseveral are NOT by her at all !
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!,"This thing will last MAYBE 24 hours. It is obviously NOT new but is a referb. My old regular battery lasted longer than this POS. I was willing to deal with the look of the huge bubble on the back of the phone, but when I STILL have to charge my phone every night or it is dead the next morning, what's the point.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
5,MUST WATCH,"So many things I had simply never even thought about. When I visited Australia a few years ago I was very amused by the toilets with the two flush buttons (half flush for #1, full flush for #2) and I remember telling my husband then I didn't understand why all American houses, the new one, didn't come with that as well to save water. I still ask myself this question. Why?"
3,Background Music Anxiety Causing not Inspiring Action,"I would focus on the end of the documentary about future action. The background music up until that final portion induced anxiety in me and I wanted to watch the documentary. I'm not certain I would watch this again. The main focus of the documentary was to bring people to action and shake people out of denial. However, the introductory portion and the music are so pointed, my feeling it drives people to throw up their hands and turn their backs on a complex problem.In contrast, simple solutions are presented at the end of the documentary. I'm just not certain how many people will last through the first hour."
5,"Water, water everywhere...","... but not a drop to drink. Doesn't just apply to sea water these days. What an eye-opening film which everyone should watch. Our water is no longer our own, what next, the air...??? I live in the desert for health reasons and its sad to think I am taking water away from those who are the rightful owners. There has to be a better way. I've always tried to conserve water, but this film made me look at what comes out of my tap in a whole new light - and admittedly makes me ashamed to have a pool..."
5,A clear analysis of a major problem,"Water will be the major problem of the coming years, both locally for most of the US and worldwide. This movie does an excellent and clear job of outlining the causes of this, both natural and political, and some of the possible courses of action. Those who routinely profit from the problems of others are already acting to their own advantage and agaist the interest of the general public. As many people as possible need to see this movie to counteract this."
3,Spare me the conclusion,The documentary is so typical of PBS. It does little to explore the many facets of the problems and concludes with hinting that a solution would be to get the United Nations more involved. If you're just looking to for a documentary that make the statement that there is a problem for your library then this one's o.k..
3,could have been summed up in a magazine article,I saw this at the Colorado Environmental Film Festival where it garnered an award but was disappointed: the actual content is quickly explained and then you sit there enduring the producers' various attempts at personalizing the issue. Tedious. I thought it was a waste of time because a viewer could gain the same information by reading an illustrated magazine article.Maybe that's the reason for the obesity epidemic: We sit on our butts eating potato chips for and hour and a half doing nothing for bloated information rather than spending our time on earth wisely.
1,This movie sucks.,"Obtaining clean water is a problem. . . however this movie is dull and boring.1. It's organized poorly.2. It says things which are dead wrong like ""Once you use the water in a lake it is gone forever."" No, water in lakes are continually replenished. Infact you can build lakes, ponds, etc. to hold water.3. It doesn't spend enough time on any one specific problem. I wanted to know about the water problem in Atlanta, Georgia. The movie says three sentences and then moves on."
3,Decent Movie,"I call it a movie because that's what it is, not a documentary. They take a set of facts and start filling in the blanks with their own beliefs and assumptions. I'm not saying that some or most of the facts aren't true but it's a crafted tale. The movie really starts to fall apart at the end when they suggest Jenna Bush is buying hundreds of thousands of acres in Paraguay (for water rights). They offer no support, only rumors and here say. An equally funded set of producers could spin a tale that shows our water supply is in no harm and we will not run out anytime soon.Keep your mind open and watch how they connect the dots."
5,Excellent Documentary,"I had to watch this documentary to write a paper for a class, and I'm very glad I did. The film provides a startling look into the global water crisis, and how corruption and profiteering are leading to appalling water quality and massive desertification of the land. It also provides hope for the future with simple solutions that will enable us to overcome these issues. Everyone should see this movie and learn about what is going on behind the scenes with the World Bank and the United Nations, and how to prevent a catastrophic global water shortage."
1,"Not a documentary, just a point of view","This is billed as a documentary, but it's no more than some people's point of view. Much of what is asserted is either unsubstantiated or downright incorrect.Crack Fox above aptly sums up the gist of this film: ""Hey, I'm not a big free trade fan and kind of dig Latin American Liberation Theology, so there.""Plus, it's rambling and tedious."
5,An Easy Way to Supplement Calcium,TRex's Bone Aid works great for us with our two Bearded Dragons. It is easy to use and much less mess than dusting worms and crickets. We use this once each week and we have very healthy lizards.
5,Very enjoyable and substantive,"Short and simple review:The Good:The book is excellently organized and the material at the end of the chapter is a paragon of summation.The Bad:However, in the Kindle version the end notes and index are not hyperlinked because there are no page numbers. As a result, both are still useful, but the Kindle version falls short of expectation on these two sections. In other Kindle books, I find hyperlinking to the appropriate location (even when page numbers are not included) is a good practice.That being said, the rest of the content is excellent. Perhaps the publisher will one day update the book to really realize the potential that the electronic format has. On this I can't really blame the author.Final Words:I like to think the value of a book is in whether or not you would recommend it to a friend. And for Gain the Edge! I definitely recommend it."
4,DoggyStyle&The Chronic are Classics,"Doggystyle&The chronic are still Slammin,but the Doggfather is just ok at best. this is a Great value for 3 discs. say what you might say now about 'Death Row"" but back in the day that was the Label on the Real.Weeessssssttttttttttttttttt Siddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!! Production&Energy were on Point all the way here.DoggFather was lacking,but it had a couple of decent joints.but in there Hey Day Death Row was Bringing the Musical heat.it was the Blue Print for all Labels that came after them."
5,Best Album ever!!!!!!!!!,I love SixGun!!!!!!their CD is sooo awesome!! they have the best sound good lyrics!!! plus they are a nice band!!! buy this album if u are into social distortion or just punk rock all together you wont be disappointed!!!!
5,A Lot Of Information On Four (4) Pages.,"The most up to date I have ... but still behind the times. Had names for elements up to 109. I know that element 110 and 111 have been named but the chart have them unnamed. Element 118 is on the chart even though the discoverers have removed their claim of discovery due to errors in their detection equipment.The chart has the usual information on the elements as most charts will have ... Name, Atomic Symbol, Atomic Number, Atomic Weight, Density, Electron Configuration, Oxidation States, Melting Point, Boiling Point and more on all of the elements up to 103.All this info folds up and will fit in a standard 3 ring note book."
4,crow dog 4 generations of medicine men,great book it was in good shape. arrived in few days. will keep it for personal library. recommended reading for others
3,Non Fiction,"The story of the Sioux leader Crow Dog. It also talks about his family and previous generations, as well as children. He has a co-writer to get all this down. This isn't too bad, and a reasonably interesting account if you are interested in that sort of history and such books as Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee."
1,Warning - This book has nothing to do with covert operations,"This book should be titled ""Perversity, Gossip, and Women's Issues in the Late Medieval Period."" It has nothing to do to with covert operations. Perhaps it is the only way the author could sell the book. Imagine spending $50 and expecting a serious discourse on medieval espionage, sabotage, spies, and assassins and receiving instead some feminist diatribe about gossip, sodomy, and other perversions. Unbelievable waste."
3,"Good, but not his best","Although Gabor Szabo on his worst day is still better than most guitarists on their best days, I have to say that this was not his best album--that would be 'The Socerer' (1967). His guitar-work is still technically brilliant, but the energy level just doesn't feel quite as high as it did in the earlier albums. Too many instrumental pop-rock covers give this album a muzak-like groove; it definitely doesn't feel jazzy or avant-guarde. It is easy on the ears, but I suppose that's the problem: it doesn't challenge them enough. If you already own everything else he did, it's still worth the price. But don't let this be your first Gabor Szabo album."
3,Daughter didn't have any complaints,"Got this for my daughter as a present. She loved the color and fit, have not heard anything to report back negative on this"
4,Worked great,"I use this card reader with my embroidery machine. I download an embroidery design and then write the design to the card for my machine. This worked great with one drawback, it sticks out too far when plugged into the front of the computer. My daughter borrowed my machine and was writing a design to it, she got up to do something and bumped it and broke it. I see in the picture it comes with a cord but mine didn't."
5,"Actual, despite its age.","Besides being a good movie by itself (and - gosh - I love B-17s), this can be used as a group leadership and motivation tool to be shown for business managers and directors, too."
5,Gregory Peck's greatest movie,This WWII epic is as real as real can get. We gain a lot at looking at a movie in Black & White. I also read how the movie was made very interesting.Alway a fan of this era. Movie story line short and sweet. Could use this in every day life as moving together with a goal & achieving the same.
4,Not much improvement over DVD,"This is one of my favorite war movies about WW II. As such, I had hoped the blu-ray copy would be far superior to the DVD, and it was not. That being said, additional features did make it a worthwhile acquisition, so if you looking for a copy of this movie for no other reason than an outstanding story about a B-17 Bombing Wing and its commander, consider this first."
2,"Great film, but with techical flaws during play.",This is a great film. It was used as class room instruction at the Air Force Officer Training School in the early '60s to illustrate different command/leadership syles. It ranks in my top 10 films of all time.The only reason this did not have a 5 star rating is due to technical flaws during replay. I suspect I just had a defective DVD.
2,Not up to BluRay Quality,"I love this movie. It's the best depiction of what it must have been like to fly with the U.S. Army Air Corps in Europe. I have seen it literally dozens of times. I purposely waited for the BluRay version so that I could have the best possible quality picture. Instead, it's grainy and not much better than the DVD version I recently rented. Very disappointing."
5,Twelve O'Clock High upgrade to Blu-ray,100% improvement on my older DVD for a very special movie. Excellent picture transition and much improved sound. Recommend upgrading this movie
5,"Incredible movie, bad DVD transfer","My favorite war film, compassionate and gritty. My second favorite Gregory Peck movie after ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". A classic that doesn't seemed to have aged at all. I gave this review five stars based on the movie, nonetheless, the DVD transfer is one of the worst I have seen. The picture transfer gets off to an excellent start but deteriorates from there (too dark on occassion, white lines, etc.). The sound quality, however, is good throughout. I can only hope Fox will re-release it with a better transfer. As a DVD extra, or Director's Cut, I'd love to see the original ending (which is still being shown in military academies). A wonderful movie worthy of your DVD library (despite the transfer)."
5,Twelve O'Clock High,"In my opinion this movie is an all-time classic. It gives you a gut feel for the radical paradigm-shift that the life or death struggle of all-out war forces people to undergo. What was once important in peace time civilian life disappears completely. And the changes in focus, thinking, priorities and agenda that participants in the conflict are forced to make, force viewers to realize how much gratitude and honor we owe to our past and present military veterans. Their heroic dedication and the sacrifices they made, and continue to make for the rest of us, are incalculable."
5,A Masterpiece!,"This film is an incredible experience! It is one of the finest war films ever made, and depicts the Air War with brutal realism: no screaming, shouting Hollywood stereotypes (as in Memphis Belle): just men going about the abnormal business of fighting a war.You will meet some unforgettable characters: Savage, Gately, Cobb. They are a tribute to their real-life counterparts.If you've ever wondered if Hollywood EVER depicts the military realistically, then wonder no more: get this movie! A word of warning, however: you won't be able to watch this movie just once!"
3,Just Ok!,"Gregory Peck did a good job acting, but you could never decide his feeling's torward his men. He made it confusing. The film was well acted by the rest of the cast, Henry King was never better at directing, but some of the performances made you wounder too much about there feelings, then what they ment and by the time you cought up with what they were saying you had missed something."
1,"Close, but no cigar",You should indicate that this is a truncated version of the original. I was most disapointed.
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A slow, plodding, and overlong war movie, Twelve O'Clock High has acquired a baffling reputation as a classic when in fact it's composed of 120 minutes of tedium and 10 minutes of archive war footage that's poorly shoehorned into the film; though the movie should perhaps be praised for looking into the psychological side of fighting, that doesn't make it any less dull to watch."
5,Twelve O'Clock High dvd,Very good movie! Gregory Peck at his best! War footage worked into the movie very well! Worth the watch!
4,Leadership,Twelve O'Clock High is an excellent study in leadership and clearly shows the propensity to adapt to circumstances in unintended ways.
5,The management of war,"This is an extremly well done story of the early months of American participation in WW II, when the Army Air Corp was learning how to conduct day light bombing missions. It is a story of the difficulty encountered while leading young men on a dangerous series of missions, critical to the war effort and threatening to the lives of the crews.It is about valor, doubt, leadership and management, and their impact on both leaders and soilders. The story's lessons apply to endeavors of both war and peace."
5,Great leadership training film!,"I purchased Twelve O'Clock High as part of an Organizational Behavior course for an MBA program. The film is not only entertaining, it's widely regarded as an important example of leadership in action. It is a great companion piece to those reading Chester Barnard's ""Functions of the Executive."" I will watch this film over and over and over again. (And have already done so.) The CD format makes it easy to focus on particular scenes for their impact."
4,Twelve O'Clock High,"I've seen this movie a number of times since it came out in the late 40s. I always considered it one of the best movies about the 8th Air Force during World War II. I'm a retired Air Force military member who remembers the era depicted in the movie very well. In the 50s, I worked with several people who flew these missions in B-17s. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Worl War II history."
5,dvd 12 o'clock high,This is one of the finest WWii movies as it focus' on leadership. The DVD version enhances the realism of all the scenes.
4,B-17 bombers,"This movie is all about B-17 Bombers, their crew, and what they went through during world war 2. The combat footage in this film is actual combat footage, people are really being shot at. I was impressed with how FAST the action was during those combat scenes. It is Black and White, a lost art these days."
4,A treat to a collector,"Despite the ""Region Warning"", DVD players produced in Brasil as from 2006, will play anything official coming from any part of the world. Quality of the recording is a ""10"" plus, and the film grips you from end to start. For a WW-II collector like myself, this is a ""collectors item"" which you cant afford to go without."
4,Work pretty well.,"These work pretty well for taking ties along on trips. The ties are fairly unwrinkled when I get to the other end. I have had some problems with getting them to roll up some ties, but with a couple tries I get them in ok."
5,Yummy scent and just the right consistency...,"I have been using Tree Hut products for the past year, but this lotion wasn't available at the store I shop at. It is absolutely purrrrrfect for my dry skin, and the scent is nutty, but subtle.It glides onto my skin and leaves no residue, so I can get dressed right after moisturizing. It also appears to be hypoallergenic, since I have a lot of allergies and have a hard time finding lotions that don't give me a rash.I highly recommend their sugar scrub too! Totally addicted to these products!!!"
4,Great for Evil Stepmother,I purchased this wig for a costume gala that took place in March. It's hard to find costumes when it is not close to Halloween! I was the Evil Stepmother from Cinderella and this was the only gray wig that didn't look like a little old lady (with low bun in back). I received lots of compliments on it.
1,Learning to Read With Phonics Sight Words is Terrible!,This is the worst learning to read video I have ever seen. My little girl does not like it either and I don't blame her. It is a low budget joke of learning video. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!
4,"Whimsical, yet practical","Do you know how hard it is to find butter dishes? This one is sturdy, yet whimsical. We just remodeled our kitchen and have a tuscan feel to it and this butter dish fits right in."
2,pretty; not great ergonomically,"Most importantly, the little nub on top is straight, narrow and smooth, making it hard to grasp if it is even slightly greasy. It needs to flare out on top. I also think the bottom section looks too big for the top, but that is just me."
2,"Good information, but.....","I purchased this book from Amazon about a month ago to help our family prepare for a trip to Rocky Mountain National Park. It is obvious that the author knows her stuff. The book is formatted in a user friendly way, giving specific details regarding the park and its trails. (here comes the big BUT...) BUT, I was very disappointed that the book literally fell apart in my hands after using it only several times. When I buy a ""guide"" type book, I would hope that it would last for than a few days of use. This thing was so shoddily made that pages were falling out of the binding almost immediately after I purchased it. The book was not misused, bent, or even creased. It just looks like it was poorly made.It is unfortunate that the author's hard work is compromised by haphazard printing and binding. I would buy another book by this author, but only if it were published by a different company."
4,"Good Info, but...","I purchased this book in preparation for a trip to the front range and RMNP. It provided everything that I (thought) I needed. For each trail, it provides information on where the trail is, a description of what you will see, the length and terrain and (most importantly to me) how heavily used the trail is.In the end, we spent all of our park time (about one long day total) checking out all of the road-side stops and scenic overlooks. We didnt get to any of the trails I had picked out.Maybe next year we'll get to use the info in the book."
4,Blue Harvest,"`Blue Harvest' is the excellent `Family Guy' parody of Star Wars: A New Hope and it ticks every box you can imagine. It's extremely funny, well written, short yet sweet and it has Stewie as Dath Vadar, what more could you want? Condensing the whole Star Wars film into about 45-50 minutes, this film still manages to pack in hilarious gags and parodies the original, whilst still being deferential to it's influence on `Family Guy' itself. Seeing Stewie as Vadar, picking holes in the death stars design flaws and Peter as Han Solo, who rings his mum to let her know he's OK after a space battle, are just a few minor touches (out of many) that make this so delightful to watch. It may be short, but this is perfectly formed and if you're fan of `Family Guy' then this will be right up your street and if you've never seen it before then this isn't that bad a place to start either! Great viewing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Must have for star wars/ family guy fans!,"The best of the family guy star wars movies! Awesome collectors set. cool shirt, great dvd, and very cool collectors items. Great item."
3,Untold Story????,"As any family guy episode I like the jokes and I specially like Stewie and Peter. But What I didn't like is that I had already seen this in Adultswim, as several episodes. So in other words don't buy it uf you watch adultswim, cause you'll watch it over and over again."
4,A movie? Amazing!,"The very first time that i watching Family Guy, it was instantly my favorite television show. When i heard that they were coming out with a movie, so a Family Guy episode times 3, i was ecstatic. I bought and watched it the first day it came out, and i laughed. At times i laughed so hard i couldn't stand it. There were also those times where i just didn't find it as funny as the show. Overall there was a good plot to the movie and the comedy wasn't terrible."
2,"Not really awful, but not really funny, either....","You sit down with a smile on your face as you press play. And then you wait. For it. To get funny. Or outrageous. Or to have one or more scenes you can consider ""classics.""And then it sort of goes on. And on. And on. And it's sorta funny at points. And then it goes on. And on. And then it's over.So you listen to the commentary. And it's sort of funny to hear them all talking about what you just watched. That wasn't that funny. And then the commentary is over.So it's okay. But only a rental because it's not that funny."
3,Family Guy without the Family Guy,"This project was the Family Guy crew getting together and having a good time. However, that good time did not really include the classic humor that we have come to love about Family Guy -- the classic humor that did make it seemed to be more of an afterthought.If you are looking for a brief run through of the Star Wars storyline, this is for you. If you are looking for another great episode, hit up itunes for the latest masterpiece.F."
2,Horrible excuse for a Family Guy movie,"I love family guy, it makes me laugh so hard and is one of my favorite shows. Well after seeing this movie, i've found out that Family Guy has lost it's touch, in my opinion. This movie is flat out boring with a weird plot. I would also like to add that this movie is NOT that funny. All it basically is is every five minutes Peter goes ""just like that time....."" and it shows a flashback. HOLY CRAP they get so old after awhile. Seriously think of something new."
5,"Hilarious! You can't go wrong, trust me!","My friend and I watched this and could not stop cracking up! The jokes are hilarious. This DVD is be fun for everyone, not just Family Guy fans!I've seen it four times and it's still funny!"
5,Family Guy - Blue Harvest,"Excellent service arriving almost immediately and arriving in new condition. Very funny cartoon video that one wants to watch over and over, catching little things that one didn't see in previous views. I recommend it to all adults with a good sense of humor who want an uplifting movie on even the darkest days. Can't wait for the next installment."
2,Potty Mouthed Disgrace,"This show is disgraceful and George Lucus ought to sue the morons that made this for every penny they have, if they have any left."
2,The Recent Mad Magazine Cover Says It All,"The Family Guy is one of the worst shows I can actually remember in recent memory. Nothing but a really bad ripoff of the Simpsons with nothing but pop culture references for jokes. Some of them funny and others just aren't. Absolutely nothing about The Family Guy is even remotely original and mostly it's just mildly funny. What's even worse is that Seth MacFarlane sunk even lower with his American Dad show which is even more redundant than The Family Guy. Even worse is this movie is even less funny than most actual Family Guy episodes. Spend your money elsewhere. Go get Skinny Puppy's new Greater Wrong of the Right live DVD. It's a better use of your hard earned money. Also, watch Robot Chicken on Adult Swim and give your ratings to that show instead of Family Guy."
2,not quite freaking sweet at all,"My hopes were high. I couldn't wait to watch it! So how come twenty minutes into it I was wondering when it was going to either a)be funny or b)be over. There's a ""joke"" every second and it's rare that they're funny. I've enjoyed most of the new episodes of the show but this movie bored me to tears and I'm glad I didn't spend money on it. The premise is uninteresting and the ending is incredibly lame. Utterly disappointing. The beginning is a little amusing and after the credits too but by then you'll be so pissed off you won't care. Save your money for the next season dvds."
2,Didn't the fans bring this show back from the dead?,"The uproar of the fans. The ratings on Cartoon Network. Was it not we the fans that brought this show back from extinction and then allowed Seth to not only get Family Guy back but create drivel like American Dad? And this is how we are repaid with a $13 two-episode disc or a $25 ""special edition?""Can't help but think greed, greed, greed here. But when Lucas gave his blessing for an episode like this to happen you had to know the marketing wheels were rolling in his head, thus here we are at 48 minutes for either 13 or 25 bucks.As for the episode itself, it was great for the most part. It has the awful let's-see-how-long-we-can-drag-it-out jokes that unfortunately Family Guy has relied on since its return. But for a fan of both Family Guy (pre-drag out jokes as long as we can) and Star Wars this is an enjoyable show."
3,STAR WARS BY WAY OF FAMILY GUY,"Though this does have it's moments, and I laughed my a** off when that old dude sings, I had the time of my life..it was just too funny, I wasnt blown away by this, maybe it's because i've seen Star Wars so many times and this does follow the movie closely. Overall, if you love Family Guy you'll probably love this, I'm not huge fan of the show, though I love Stewy, so I liked it, didnt love it..."
2,Underwhelming,"Disappointingly less funny than a normal Family Guy episode. 3D scene very disappointing. Lucas interview vaguely interesting. I gave it 2 stars because you are really buying the t-shirt, and I have to admit the t-shirt is kind of awesome, except that it makes others in the know aware i overpaid for a lame episode of family guy.don't buy this unless you really, really want the t-shirt."
3,Great Show Not so Great Movie,"Although Family Guy is one of the funniest shows on TV, with unmatched humor, that humor is better placed in a 30 minute show instead of an 88 minute DVD. The jokes were funny and the had all the appeal of the show, however it seemed to be three shows wrapped together and placed in an 88 minute long movie. The characters seemed a little off, not quite the same feel as in the show, almost as if this wasn't created by the Family Guy staff but by an outside writing team. Great to watch one time, but this one won't be found in my DVD collection."
2,It's 'Family Guy' without the humor,"It's not that this DVD is necessarily bad...it's just not funny. It's almost like they took a normal Family Guy episode, lengthened it, and then surgically removed all the funny stuff. If I'd wanted to watch a boring, laugh-less Fox cartoon, I would have watched any episode of King of the Hill in syndication...for free.Don't spend the money on this stinker. Rent it, Netflix it, or just borrow it from some other poor soul (like me) who bought this $20 coaster."
3,'Stewie' is nothing special,"I recently purchased Stewie Griffin - The Untold Story, and after watching it, I was quite dissapointed. Basically all you see is a long, drawn out, 'there's been funnier' episode of the TV show. I had high expectations for 'Stewie.' Given that creator Seth MacFarlane now has a larger time frame, and possibilities that aren't available on network television, he seems to have fallen short on what he could have done."
2,Dissapointed,"I had very high expectations for this movie. I wasn't expecting anything all too great or bad ...just a fun, well made flick like South Park. As I watched this movie, from the start I was pretty dissapointed. There were some funny scenes but overall the dialogue was poor and it seemed like the plot was just getting dragged till the end. It didn't seem like there was much effort put into making this movie even though it has been the hot topic with the show for many months now. All in all, I had just as much fun with this movie as any other regular Family Guy episode but you can't help but think that MacFarlane and crew lost an opportunity for something special."
2,This is not funny,"Okay, I'm not a huge ""Family Guy"" fan, but i like some of the episodes. this movie sucks! i'ts not funny and the only reason people like it is because they are loyal fans. most family guy fans are kids that think it's cool because of the gross out humor. it used to be southpark which stupid kids liked because it cursed. nobody who watches family guy thats a kid actually gets the jokes. and fans hate the simpsons for some reason. anyway this movie made me get the feeling that it was slapped together over the weekend and then put on the market. it's cheap not lasting fun"
2,Could be better,"I am as big of a Family Guy fan as you can get, and I was let down by this DVD. Maybe I was expecting too much. It's worth a watch as any episode is, but don't go into it thinking it's going to be the best material you have seen."
1,"Lifeless, jokeless, pointless.","I can't understand why anyone makes such a big deal about this episode. It is basically a fairly straight run-through of the first Star Wars movie. Jokes are VERY few and far between, and I'm left with the impression that the Family Guy crew was so in awe of being given permission to do this show that they forgot they were supposed to be making Family Guy and not re-making Star Wars.This episode was SO incredibly boring that it burst the Family Guy bubble for me. I used to be a fan of the show. Now, I couldn't care less."
1,Ouch,"I won't say much. But I'm a HUGE Family Guy fan, and this movie was horrible. I'm not comparing it to the first 3 seasons, I'm taking it for what it is, 3 really poor episodes put together with 3 or 4 funny moments. I was really excited to see it and I can't explain how disappointing the writing was. It felt like something that a Family Guy fan would write. Sorry, just beind honest."
2,NOT WORTH IT!,"This Star Wars spoof is pretty funny. If you're seen the original a few thousand times like I have, you'll respect that these guys have seen it the same amount of times.That being said, this does not warrant a Collector's Edition! What a BS way to make a quick buck! The episode is only 45 minutes long! Are you seriously going to spend $30 on a 45 minute DVD?"
1,16 bucks for an episode???,"The 1 star rating isn't for the episode itself. I'd give that about a 4. But Fox is at it again; first they decide to release seasons 4 and 5 in 2 seperate sets each. Now they show even more lack of repect for the viewers by releasing this. Why the hell would anyone buy this rather then waiting for season 6, part 1, which will include Blue Harvest anyway? God damn Fox, why can't you just release Family Guy like every other show, season by season."
4,A great parody.,I thoroughly enjoyed this and it delivered in all the ways I expected. I will look forward to the next one.
4,Classic Family Guy Humor,"I got this ""Movie"" when it first came out. Well, I have since watched it, and I must say that it's just as hilarious watching it for the second, third, fourth time as it was the first. Now, as most people pointed out, this really is just 3 episodes on 1 DVD, but even then, this DVD has so much replay value, I find it hard to care. The jokes at the time were fresh, and just as random as the earlier Family Guy episodes in the first few seasons and rarely are there any flat or dull points. I especially loved the ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" reference which leads to Peter's new news segment on Channel 5. If you enjoy Family Guy, the earlier episodes/seasons especially, then I'm sure you'll love this DVD."
3,Unfortunately...,"It is 3 episodes put together faking to be like a movie, but anyways, i thought it was good, but I didn't like once it came in the mail, the cover was different from the picture on here. I wanted the one with Stewie griffin, half his face showing and him saying ""NEVER BEFORE SEEN!"" but instead I got a boring black cover with the griffin family on it.For the movie itself, it was funny and awesome, family guy-must see!i was just disappointed in the cover art and how that picture lied to us all."
5,Dirty,"This movie made my gut hurt from laughing so hard. So much like the show but also very different. Much more dirty, foul, and obscene. It's not just about Stewie. If you like the show, you will like the movie. It's short, so you can pop in the DVD player anytime."
3,so so,I was hoping for more... I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com but it really was not all that.
5,Absolute Genius...one of the best shows around,"Wow...I was introduced to family guy about a month ago and I can't believe I had been missing out on this. The best to describe it is that Family Guy is like Simpsons on steroids...the same type of random, fast-paced comedy but taken to its extreme. It's irrelevant lunacy is the genius of it. And to all who've seen the DVD, isn't that stork with the red lamp scene just the funniest thing you've ever seen?Don't even think about it anymore...buy this DVD today. Guaranteed laughs."
2,A disappointment,"Stewie is perhaps one of the funniest characters I've seen on television, ever, and until now, I thought he stole every scene of every Family Guy episode he featured in. Stewie is played like one can imagine would be a remake of The Omen, if the part of the moppet anti-Christ Damien was played by David Niven, wearing a smoking jacket and sipping martinis. The character Stewie is a figure that can give you hours of belly laughs as well as ""sleeping with the lights on"" night terrors all in one package.But this ""Untold Story"" just doesn't do right by him. It causes more wincing than anything else. There's too much emphasis on witless crudity, and too little on Family Guy's usual brand of wild but clever comedy."
3,Family Guy Awesome,The first eposode was a classic. If you like show like The Simpsons or American Dad you love this DVD set
3,"GREAT movie, BAD bonus features","First off, let me start out by saying this was the biggest waste of money ever. I spent $22.99 at FYE for this DVD. The movie itself is great, but there are hardly any bonuses. The only 2 bonuses are the audio commentary, and some uncolored-to-colored comparison...and previews for the FG season sets and AMERICAN DAD. I'd rather rent this movie 10 times than buy it."
4,Awesome for the serious FG fan,"This is the best Star Wars parody I've ever seen. Even non Family Guy fans will love it. This version includes a shirt, trading cards, and 3D glasses to watch the exclusive to this version 3d fight scene. Unless you're a really serious FG fan, just get the regular edition. The cards and shirt are cool, but the 3D scene is a waste. The quality is poor, and not worth bothering with, which is why I rate it 4 stars not 5. I loved the extras like Seth McFarlane's interview with George Lucas. He would hum tunes from different parts of different Star Wars movies, and see if George knew what part the tune came from. George missed them all. Classic. Either way, this dvd is awesome!"
3,"Its a great DVD, but...","This DVD special edition was good, price-wise for the goodies that came with it. The picture and the quality of the art work is wonderful, almost like they actually scanned the original Star Wars movie (maybe they did...).But the story... they weren't too inventive, really. Basically copying the original story line. I had to buy this because I am a great fan of Star Wars and parody. But in terms of originality, I thinkRobot Chicken: Star Wars, which I bought at the same time from Amazon, was far more inventive and funny.One thing about both DVDs is that both the creators are called Seth, and if they could have kept the humor clean my young sons who are big Star Wars fans would have been able to watch it. I guess some writers think dirty is funny...Best part may be the excitement on the face of the exec producer when he is interviewing ""The Checkered One"", George Lucas!"
2,Lame and Tame,"Seth misses the boat on this one. Gone are the rapid fire in-your-face parodies, and the story line is weak and incomplete. Too bad, it had potential, but it went straight to video for a reason."
1,FALLS FLAT ON IT'S FACE!,"YAWN...What happened? I fell asleep? This movie sucks a*s! Why is this lame (and censored) movie ""unrated""? DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE, IT IS LAME BEYOND LAME! Don't even rent this weak attempt at comedy! Borrow it from a friend who stole it from a department store; after watching it...please break the disc in half....that is all."
4,Good...,"Family Guy producers are aware of the fact that Stewie is the most original charahcter of the bunch and that he deserves a 1.5 hour special. One must not mistake it for a regular 30 min. episode, as the comparaison will be on par with ""an apple vs. a daisy"" [as in ""they're both kind of plants""], and see the movie on its own basis. My favorite FG episodes have always been driven around Stewie [with a little bit of Brian, as a counterpoint ot Stewie's ""delightful evil""ness], and this movie at the 15$ Amazon price is a must-have for FG fans."
2,Disappointing,"I found the movie disappointing -- it simply isn't as funny as the TV show. While much of it is ""amusing"" I only laughed out loud a handful of times. If you have the expectation that this movie will go where the TV show couldn't, you will be disappointed. The movie is significantly less edgy than TV show. Stewie's acid tongue has been nuetralized and Brian's wit and charm have evaporated. Much of the movie is focused on the Brian-Stewie relationship and the two even take a road trip together, but nothing here compares to the TV episode where Brian and Stewie find Brian's mother.As has been pointed out in other reviews, the movie is really 3 TV plots woven together into a long form. Unfortunately they weren't the best 3 TV story lines."
3,The best part was the end...,"...where Chris says, ""Didn't Robot Chicken already do this?""While my father, brother and I are all huge Family Guy fans, this wasn't really THAT funny. Although I did like when Chris (Luke) says, ""You do know a parsec is a unit of distance and not time, right?"" So true...The only thing this episode has going for it is that it's Star Wars...but if you want a REALLY funny Star Wars parody, do waht Chris says and go see the Robot Chicken Star Wars."
5,Funny funny FUNNY!,"Love Stewie's Character, although he is evil, the little guy is funny, He is also very confused. Stewie Griffin the Untold story is a Straight to DVD movie, but does a good job with the silly story about stewie meeting himself in the future."
3,Love Family guy and this is a great price but...,"...But there are no extra features like there are on the dvd. This, as with all Amazon Unbox downloads, is a very high quality Windows media file taken from the DVD apparently, as all curse words etc. are intact, but with one audio track and no subtitles or captions. Digital downloads are no substitute for DVD, so save your money; if you are looking for the best value I suggest getting the DVD here on Amazon or on ebay, possibly even your local discount superstore. I long for the day when Digital downloads will contain all the features that a DVD does, it's mighty convenient."
2,Not A-Material,"Nothing is going to stop you from buying this if you are a huge Family Guy fan. And if you're a huge fan, I wouldn't try to dissuade you anyway. Just want to let you know it's not their best material, and there's next to 0 special features. So get it cheap and ask yourself how much it's worth to you first."
3,Family Guy,I thought this was a new DVD. My son loves Family Guy. It turned out to be episodes that were on TV already. My son has all the seasons and had already seen these episodes. The signal was a little broken up on our HDTV. I haven't tried it on another TV yet. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known it was TV episodes.
4,"DVD was good but not great, collectibles were awesome!","If you are a diehard fan of Family Guy, you will more than likely enjoy this DVD. It was not as funny as I had hoped, but I did not feel at the end of the hour that I had wasted my time or money with this movie. If you have a problem with the price of the special edition or the regular edition you can check out my comment in response to one of the 1 star reviews of this product for my detailed thoughts on that. In short, I paid $20 for the special edition and it was worth it for me. If you don't care about getting the t-shirt or the collectible cards-check out the regular version."
2,the tv episodes are way funnier,This movie is not very funny. Save your money and buy one of the tv seasons.
2,Not what you'd think!,"First off, I love ""Family Guy"" I try not to miss an episode. That being said, I was a little disappointed in this DVD. When I read ""uncensored"" on the DVD cover I said to myself ""OH YEAH!"" But that cover is misleading. I was thinking that this will be more outrageous than what they show on TV but it's exactly the same as what they show on TV. They even bleeped out the swear words! Don't be fooled if you think your getting anything different than whats on TV! Your not!"
2,Wow,"Family Guy was a fantastic animated program... Notice that I said ""was"". All of their jokes WERE original. Every minute DID deserve a laugh. But they used their jokes too many times. This movie is a good example of their mistakes. You know when they have a minute of the same joke (Like when Peter banged his knee in that episode of the parody of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""). They use it all the time now! IT GETS OLD! And this is just one example of their mistakes. This movie, in my opinion, was not the best it could've been... A disgrace to what Family Guy used to be."
3,Kind of a rip off,"So i got this thinking i would be getting a family guy the same length as the star wars spoofs but thats not what i got,instead i got a twenty min long family guy and the rest was from their live show that they did last year on fox that i didn't really enjoy. I feel ripped off."
4,Better than Space Balls!,"Star Wars spoofs go waaaay back so this is not the first time a good parody has been made but it is probable the best! This is not a story like Episode 3, it is Episode 3 Family Guy style. Family Guy worked with Lucas Film on the project and got permission to use the original score and other copyrighted material. This is a tight and funny take on the story."
2,"Something, Something, Something...Eh?","I don't know if it's the comparison to Blue Harvest or that it's difficult to just satirize The Empire Strikes Back while including the majority of the plot, but Something Something Something Darkside just kinda missed the mark. The entire program felt a little rushed, taking too long for some of the gags and speeding through others. If you've watched the trailer, the only really funny part you missed were the cracks at Fox in the credits at the beginning."
4,Wishy Washy Humor,"I was SOOOOOOOOO excited anticipating this DVD. Then, after buying it and finishing watching it, I was kinda...umm....disappointed. I mean sure, it had some really really funny moments and kept me laughing, alot of the material seemed rehashed and overused, like I'd seen it millions of times before on the TV show. Definitely worth purchasing, but after the first watch, it's only funny after shelving it for a few months and pulling it back out again."
4,Good if you know what you're looking for,"Family Guy is something you know if you're going to like. So if you order this and you don't like it, you're the one with the problem, not the product. In my opinion, the first few seasons of Family Guy were the best because Seth MacFarlane was not yet a political tool. Reliable entertainment!"
3,That's All?,"This is a must for Family Guy and Star Wars fans. My only complaint is that it is entirely too short. Coming in at a scant 45 minutes, it's barely longer than an actual episode of Family Guy. That being said, the usual Family Guy humor is alive and well in this DVD. I would advise buying the non-special edition: the extras (t-shirt, collectables, etc) aren't impressive (unless you happen to wear an XL-tee and actually want to wear an XL tee with Family Guy on it - then go for it).The extras aren't very good, either - commentary is pretty good, but the rest (including an awkward and tense interview with George lucas) are fairly boring."
2,Very disappointing,"I'm the original Family Guy fan. I remember watching the first episode in 1998 in my freshman dorm in college. I was very excited when the show came back on the air, and had obviously lost none of its spark.When I heard about the movie I couldn't wait to watch it. However, I was very disappointed. Perhaps as a FG fan I had expected the movie to be at par or better than the TV shows. It isn't. The animation is slightly different and the plot is weak and fragmented. I had the impression that the charecters were trying to hard to be funny, which I have never felt in an episode.I guess perhaps FG was meant to be in the 30 min format, and just doesn't translate well into a movie."
2,"Copy, paste, trace","The idea is easy to follow-Family Guy does a Star Wars bit.Now, as a fan of both, I was bored.There are many small scenes that are almost perfect recreations of actual scenes from the movie.Had they not been slow, boring backrounds without talking that didnt add to the plot that would have been fine.Add a few of these and it might get on your nerves. Good effort, but Ive seen it, I know it, I dont need to see it again.The second problem with this is the jokes.Just like the Stewie Movie, the good jokes are scarce.There is one running gag throughout involving Peter and a great Meg appearance that got me going, but other then that there arent many good lines for any of the other characters.That and a song that I could have done without.Rent it, or if your a serious Family Guy fan buy one of the dvds used for cheap, but I cant see spending real money on this."
2,Not worth it,If you are not a left-wing moron you are going to feel like you got ripped off by buying this turd-basket.
1,Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin - The Should Have Remained Untold Story,"Absolutely freakin' terrible. I might have laughed a dozen times throughout this waste of plastic. I should have known something was up when it started out with a 45 second anti-piracy commercial. Well folks, this is one movie you can safely download without fear of trampling on anyone's artistic rights - because it's not art. It's not even uncensored. It's a shameless moneygrab by Seth McFarlane and Fox.Needless to say, I'll be returning this one tomorrow. $16 buys an awful lot of toliet paper."
3,I have to agree with some of you.,"This is getting a little rediculous. I recieved the last two volumes for Christmas and I believe they cost a grand total of 70 dollars. Then when searching through the 5th volume for some of the episodes in that season that I really wanted to see, I came to realize that they aren't even on it. How can you market an incomplete season for over 30 bucks. And now one episode for 13 dollars. Gimmie a break, I am a fan but this is getting out of control...And the entertainment industry wonders why people copy and burn things..."
1,HEY GUYS REMEMBER STAR WARS!?? THAT'S THE JOKE!,"I have too much money and I need to burn it on something, OH I KNOW, WHAT IF STAR WARS WAS RE-ENACTED BY MY FAVORITE ZANY CHARACTERS FROM FAMBLY GAY! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAT'D BE SOOOOOO FUNNEH XD! Even though I watched Star Wars once when I was like 9, I just can't stop talking about Star Wars because 80's nostalgia is trendy!Hey guys, remember when Stewie was Darth vader!?!?!?? See that's funny because he's like a small little baby but he's made to be this powerful entity, that's funny because proportions!If you love Star Wars starring family guy than be sure to check out Seth Mcfarlene's Cavalcade of Cartoon Diarrhea, unfortunately it's not all copmletely centered around Star Wars so NEVERMIND SCREW IT everything sucks now the 80's were the best right guize?? Check out my ironically unironic Kanye West glasses, sooooooooooo 80's!!@!! xDDDDLOL ok guys see you at the next LMFAO concert!"
3,Family Guy: The Movie Review,"I saw separate pecies of this movie on TV and I must say that I am somewhat impressed. There are laughs and misses on this movie. I enjoyed most of the movie except the flashbacks and other off topic sequences. Some of them are funny at first and then get annoying. I wish I would have watched the movie on its DVD because I bet there were things on it that TV wouldn't show. So I guess if people are going to see this movie on TV I would read this review, but if you're going to rent it or buy it, I would rather read another one.-Ben Russell"
1,"Bad humor, bad language","I bought this DVD thinking it was a clever take on Star Wars... The DVD did not meet my expectations, the humor is dense and lacks finesse, as for the language, it is mostly vulgar and poorly chosen."
2,3 episodes re-packaged! RIP OFF!,"If you are a Family Guy fan and own the regular seasons, then you already own this video. This is no more than 3 old episodes with a new short intro and they leave the language intact. So there is nothing new here. A total waste of money if you own the Seasons...they REALLY should tell you that instead of putting a new bow on old episodes!"
3,"worth rental, not funny enough to own...","There are some funny moments, but the frame story -- the griffins watching a movie about themselves -- is dopey and too long. in fact, there are too many jokes that are drawn out -- a gag FG used to use sparingly and now uses just about every episode.Anyway. I own all of the available shows and will buy the new set by christmas, but i'm glad i rented this before buying it."
1,seriously?,I love family guy. but why do they think because this spoof was star wars related it merits being released on it's own? Bad Seth! Baaaaaad!
2,...Uhhh...That's it?,"When I seen that they were releasing unseen Family Guy episodes on DVD, I went out and bought it at 6 in the morning before work. I watched it that night and putting am it on Amazon right now. Its sad to say that I bought a three episode DVD for 20 bucks and it wasn't anything different, but worse, than the shows on Adult Swim. For being 'unrated' and all that jazz, nothing special. True fans will be disappointed. Its a definate renter at best. Very disappointed.... :("
1,Just Bad.,"They are doing everything they can to make a quick buck, and this is the climax of that. From whole seasons, to half seasons, to an episode. Im sorry, but the parody of star wars wasnt even that great, actually my favorite part of the episode was the ending, when Chris was saying that Robot Chicken was better, because it surely was."
1,Lame.,"I'm a huge fan of Family Guy's first 3 seasons, and a few of the episodes from 4 were ok, but I really expected more. It was an hour and a half of poorly written jokes and four letter words. Don't get me wrong - I wasn't offended by the language. I just think it's sad Family Guy has stooped to using crude language rather than clever jokes. If Meg getting made fun of for being boyish, Lois dropping the f bomb, and Chris yelling random things loudly sounds funny to you, then buy this. This ranks up there with Dumb & Dumberer and Saving Silverman as one of the least funniest movies of all time. Yeah - that bad."
5,Freakin' hilarious. Period!,"THIS MOVIE IS UNFREAKIN'BELIEVABLY FUNNY. I didn't stop laughing, and if I did I started a few seconds later. Stewie is my hero, man! I won't say anything else so I don't spoil this highly entertaining movie to anybody who hasn't seen it, but this is a definite buy for any Family Guy fanatic because it's everything you'd expect from Family Guy, but on DVD. Even the intermission (oops! I let it slip, yo) part is really funny.BUY THIS DVD. It's absolutely worth the money."
3,Just as intro says...average.,"The intro to the movie in the traditional Star Wars words fading into outer space basically gives the review up front. There will be some funny parts, but it was average at best. Stewie as Vader gives some good laughs, but might be better to wait until it comes down in price a little."
4,it was ok,"I really liked Family Guy when it first came out. However, after watching the DVDs of the first couple of seasons within just a few days, it wasn't too tough to figure out the pattern/blueprint for this show. Now I feel it's pretty predictable. Still, I longed for those days when it was fresh and I really liked it. Heard about this one and got it, hoping that it was something old, which had never been aired. While it wasn't that, it was a bit more creative than the Family Guys of late and I did have a few good laughs.If you're a fan, I think you'll like it. I liked it, although I wouldn't watch it again and am glad that I rented rather than bought it."
5,Amazing!,"When this first aired, it was the first time I'd actually paid attention to Family Guy. I've always been a Star Wars fan, and watching this made me a Family Guy fan very quickly! For fans of either, I'd absolutely recommend this. You get the episode, with some deleted bits restored, plus interviews with George Lucas, making of the episode, and several other special features."
2,Very disappointed,"We are huge Family Guy fans and couldn't wait to see this ""Untold Story."" We were both incredibly disappointed. The DVD isn't long, is not as funny as regular Family Guy episodes, and there is nothing ""unrated"" about it. A waste of money and definitely not something to watch more than once."
2,Disappointing,"I was a little disappointed with this parody, but it could be because I am not really a fan of Family Guy. There was very little real satire ...most of it was just a synopsis of Episode IV with different actors and throw in the requisite amount of profanity and toilet humor. There were precious few truly clever scenes and most of them were in the trailer clips. (I did think the scene of the guy sitting in front of his trailer with a light-saber being used as a bug-zapper was quite original, though. And, as an older viewer, I appreciate the ""Airplane!"" reference.) And as a Christian I was much more offended by the Storm-trooper Church sequence than the suggestion that ""the Force"" is perceived as mostly gnostic anti-Christian. All in all, if you're a Star Wars fan, I would only buy this if you feel you must have a 'complete' collection. Otherwise, don't waste your money -- borrow it from the library."
5,Classic Family Guy take on Cinematic royalty,"If you're a Family Guy fan, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't enjoy this skit. I think it's much better than the Robot Chicken version although that had its moments. This skit takes the Star Wars parody genre to a whole new level. Some very funny bits in here and definitely worth the addition to your FG collection. As usual though, the creepy old pedophile sank my interest a but. His rendition of ""I've Dad The Time of My Life"" killed my buzz."
4,Family Guy + Star Wars = A Classic,"I can't give 5 stars to a single episode that you have to buy on it's own. This was, however, amazing. I watched it a million times. I watched all of the extras. I absolutely LOVED this DVD.If you are a Star Wars fan, and you're a Family Guy fan, this is worth owning."
2,Wasn't as good as the first one.,Wait to see it on TV. I bought it because i got it half off. but it wasn't that funny. watch robot chicken instead. Way better!!!
3,A disappointed Family Guy fan,"Don't get me wrong, I love Family Guy as much as the next person. I had expected to be rolling on the floor throughout the entire movie but that was not the case. There were a few times were I laughed but overall, nothing compared to a normal Family Guy episode. Save your money and rent it at the video store instead, you won't regret it. Also, the only way you can get the movie uncensored is by going into language and clicking on the uncensored version."
2,Disappointing,"I am a Family Guy fan from its original airing several years ago, and have stayed loyal (despite the fact that the new episodes are sub-par). However, I cannot recommend this DVD, because it just isn't funny. I watched all 88 minutes of it waiting for something funny to happen. It didn't. Family Guy (the series as well as this movie) seems to have devolved into flimsy, unfunny plots strung together with stupid fantasy flashbacks introduced with the phrase: ""Like the time I..."" I am fast becoming tired of it."
2,I like the show but...,"The show is fun but is beter buy a good movie like National Treasure, Tron or other good movie beacuse is a lot of good movies(actually 114 movies) for psp."
2,A big disappointment.,"I love Family Guy, so I was really looking forward to this movie. When I saw it, though ... yikes. Many of the jokes seem forced. The timing is often mediocre. Almost everyone goes inexplicably out of character at one point or another. The references to past episodes seem self-congratulatory rather than clever. And most of all, it's WAY WAY WAY TOO LONG.The middle third, written by Alex Borstein, is significantly better than the rest, but even that isn't up to the level of the best episodes. As for the outer thirds -- well, there are brilliant moments everywhere, but they're usually buried in second-rate hackery."
4,Actually good,"I'm no fan of Family Guy, but I found this movie fun as well as funny. The jokes and spoofs are entertaining. The movie within a movie plot line works well and is a change to normal movie plots. I was pleased by the film."
5,Im assuming you love this before you buy it,"Basically before you buy this im assuming you love Family Guy and the Blue Harvest episode that aired. So here is my review of the DVD since the show is 5 stars. The special features are much better than anything you get from South Park. I found this box filled with the usual top notch extras Family Guy is known for. You get a great full length commentary, an interview with George Lucas that runs about 15mins, the animatic, behind the scenes about the creation, promos, and a sweet reel of all the times Family Guy has made Star Wars during the shows run. This least feature was unexpected and runs a lot longer than you'd think. I got a lot of bang for the buck out of this and I hope you will too."
3,Not bad,"Certainly funny, even more off-color humor then you see on TV. Could have been better though, I think I laugh much more at the episodes. At moments you could tell when something was suppose to be funny, but it just wasn't. I don't think that ever happens on the TV episodes. Rent this one first."
3,Flat(ulent) Family Guy Comedy,"It's lucky for us all that this wasn't the FIRST Family Guy episode aired, as there were few laugh-out-loud moments on this DVD and the show may have been cancelled even earlier on than it originally was. Everybody loves Stewie, so a whole DVD created around his character is a good idea, but the humor seemed phoned in and uninspired. It's worth seeing if you're a big fan, but I wouldn't lose any sleep if it's taking a while for you to get around to seeing it."
4,Okay but Could be Better,"Okay the firest part was great...the whole pool thing with Stewie rocked.After all that the whole ""Stewie meeting his possible father"" was just to drawn out. That could have been done alot better. It was just needed a bit more comedy but overall I was only able to give it 4 out of 5 just for that reason.Maybe I am used to the whole 30 minute shows, and also I am not a big fan of just focusing on one character like this show did, I like it being more spread out. When they did try to add others on it just messed up the flow of the story."
4,Finally a compilation,Finally got a chance to watch the full DVD version. Enjoyed it. It's better than the untold story release where they slapped together episodes. Looking forward to more releases like this one.
1,Big waste of time,"Wow! First off let me say that I am a big Family Guy fan and have seen every episode. So when I heard this movie was coming out, I couldn't wait to watch it. Wow I feel cheated out of my time....believe me, you will to. Sure there are some funny jokes here and there, but there were so many sexual inuends and frequent cussing, that it just messed it up. And is it just me, or is Family Guy funnier when the jokes aren't about sex? I found myself asking when it will end. The story sucks and so does this movie."
5,STOP THE MADNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK you people, stop writing reviews about the psp dvd version of this movie! There is a dvd version if you people actuly looked around this website. This is going to be frekin sweet, so stop blabbering about the psp version."
1,one of the worst movies ever.,"A full length Family Guy movie might sound like a good idea, and definitely a good financial move, considering how popular(and overrated imo) Family Guy is nowadays. But when I saw the results of this idea, I completely realized that Family Guy is not a show to make a feature film out of. Aqua Teen Hunger Force even worked better as a movie than Family Guy did. The whole thing is just 3 modern episodes tied together. And if you read my other Family Guy review, you'd know that I'm not a fan of alot of recent Family guy episodes. And many of the great flaws and negativities of recent episodes are all present in this movie. And even worse, I did not laugh even once throughout the whole movie. I laugh occasionally in every new family guy episode, but not once in this whole movie did I laugh."
5,A Lot Better Than The Shows!!!,"Pardon my French, but some episodes of the show Family Guy are just f*****g stupid!!!! Now, the show had its moments, but not nearly as funny as Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story. This movie is just so full of awesome, vulgar, unrated fun. Oh, this movie is for ages 14 and up, unless you want your eight year old asking,"" Mommy, Daddy, why is the fat man poking the pretty lady with his pencil?"" Well, I guess not all of the humor is vulgar, but most of it is about sex, alcohol, and people who look like they are masturbating, but are really playing Crash Bandicoot on their GameBoy. [ See the end of the movie ] Anyway, I think that Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story is definately for fans of Family Guy, but if you think that Family Guy is the best show on the planet, well...............you're wrong!!! And right!!! BYE BYE!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!"
1,Stay far far away,"Unlike the series, this 'movie' is completely unfunny and boring. nothing of interest happens throughout Stewie's ""journey"" (which, doesn't even begin until 60 minutes in. The plot is terrible, and the writing moreso.Buy one of the boxsets, or 'best of' collections of Family Guy if you want to laugh, but avoid this. Unfunny. Boring. Poorly written. Terrible plot."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:""The Untold Story"" is not much of a ""movie"": it's padded even at 88 minutes and consists basically of 3 sketches the length of the TV show--it's diverting enough, especially if you're a fan of the show, but is really probably not worth buying."
3,"It's just ok, and I'm a fan!","I love Family Guy but this video left me flat. The film, for all it's ""unrated, uncensored"" comments is as tame as the show is on television. There are laughs here the duration between them is a little longer than I'd like."
1,Not buying into this,"I am not buying this Dvd. It's sad to say that, because I'd love to own it, but I refuse to buy into Fox mocking the fans. LET'S FACE IT, the only reason the show came back was because they were making so much money off of the seasons already released. So, they bring back the show and pump out episodes. Volume 3 had what, like 14 episodes max? Anyways, combine that with releasing half of a season (Volume 5), releasing ONE episode for $15, and the ""Family Guy Movie"" which was 3 episodes (also aired as the season finale last year)... AUGH! Enough is enough already! I'm a Famly Guy fan but I'm not buying into it anymore--- and I'm a DVD COLLECTOR! I buy random dvd's all of the time, I own tons and tons of movies, I cannot buy movies without having all seasons or sets. The fact that I wont buy this is saying a lot. They've lost more than one fan now."
2,"Buy the REGULAR version, don't bother with the Deluxe version","I'm a huge fan of FG and I loved the movie (except there was no ""giggidy"" at all....what's up with that?!), anyway, having said that I would recommend to just save some bucks by just buying the regular version. Here are the flaws of the Deluxe version:- the shirt only comes in ""XL"", which you only find out when you've already purchased the DVD and opened it. We are not all as big as Peter Griffin you know. I wear ""M"" and wouldn't have made a big deal if it was at least ""L"".- the 3D scene... what 3D?!! it looks the same with or without the glasses. The only thing I was able to see with the glasses was the image formed when putting together all the cards.Unless you're a FG collector, just spend your money on the regular version."
1,You have to be kidding! rip off,I have lost almost all respect for the former great show. Once again ripping off the fans has happened. At least american dad is still good.
3,movie was ok but it lacks extras,"movie was ok but it lacks extras,i was hoping for some deleted scens or funny out takesi say just buy the movie just for the movie not if you want to see extras"
1,Skip it.,"A single 23 minute episode for $11? Pass. It was all about abortion anyway, since no modern producer can just make a show that steers clear of controversial issues that everybody can enjoy regardless of their political and religious affiliations."
2,Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin - The Untold Story,"I'm a huge Family Guy fan, but this just didn't measure up. Was disappointed. Although it did have its moments."
5,"Uncensored, ninety-minutes long, and commercial-free Family Guy at its best.","""Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin - The Untold Story"" is a wonderful/hilarious movie that centers around the very popular and animated Griffin family. Any fan of the television show will undoubtedly appreciate this movie because not only does it involve the usual antics of the show, but also gives the fans ninety-minutes of non-commercial entertainment. The jokes are riskier than those of the television show, the story goes a little more in depth, and it is just a longer version of what Family Guy fans enjoy already on television. If you are a fan of Family Guy, then you definitely owe it to yourself to purchase this film and watch it.**Words of caution: Before watching this movie, make sure you select the ""uncensored"" option from the setup menu provided on the DVD. If you don't do this, then you will get bleeps throughout the movie at particular points."
4,Freakin Hilarious but...,"I thought the movie was absolutely hilarious. The plot wasn't stellar but its the random, crazy, off the wall stuff that puts me in stitches anyway not so much the plot. I'm glad I bought it.However, my dissappointment with this dvd is not related to the content. I was terribly distracted by the quality, or lack thereof, of the dvd. The picture was bad in spots and the brightness varied during some scenes. I may have just received a bad disc or something because the quality is just poor.Still funny though!"
4,"great for display, but not for playing with","I'm ten and when I saw this in my stocking, I was exited. Darth vader is my idol! I thought it was really cool how he's silver and all like he's turned so powerful he turned platium. But when I took it out of the box, I was really disappointed when I saw that the knees don't bend and the elbows don't move up and down. Like I said, great for display, but not for playing with."
3,My First Book of Sign,This Book has very nice bright pictures but it is very hard tofollow as far as knowing what the hand movements are. There is a section in the back of the book that has sign descriptions for every sign but it's very slow going if you don't know the sign and you have to turn to the back of the book to check hand position. I was quite disapointed in this book.
2,not as good as others,"I recently bought several books for learning sign language since my 3 year old has delayed speech, and this is my least favorite. It is hard to tell from the pictures what they are doing and the description is in another section of the book which is a pain to flip back and forth The pictures are ok, but there are better ones. If you are looking for a kids picture book, try My First 100 Words (Sign Language) by Scholastic, and Michiyo Nelson. Or if you are serious about learning signs to teach your baby try The Baby Signing Book."
2,My First Book of Sign,"Title of the Book is My First Book of Sign.The cover looks great, but from the 1st page to page 15 of a 75 page book, it has a bad water/mildew stain about 3"" in diameter.So, I'm not really happy.I've bot several times from Amazon an this is the first time I've been disappointed. Sincerely"
5,one of the best of all time,"This is such a great album, from beginning to end. It's a classic and one of Julio's very best."
4,Should be the Perfect Album,"This should be the perfect album. Every song is catchy and wonderfully crafted. They're all radio friendly. Yet, somehow, it fails to be the perfect album. It all seems too easy for Damon Gough. It's almost like he's showing off, like he never breaks a sweat. 'Yes, yes, we know you're that talented. Can you push the envelope please?' I've heard everything before. It's archetypal pop. Still, it's hard to knock this album and I am only knocking it because its so good, because it feels so effortless. It's a romantic comedy of a CD starring Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant. Of course, it's good, how could it not be? But it lacks the heart to make it great."
4,Well worth your time,"Finally! A band with a different sound, one that doesn't rely on Oasis-esque drum-licks *shudder* to further their album. Different, creative, introspective... this album is one to listen to when you have the time to LISTEN to it; It deserves to be listened to, in its entirety. While there are some worthless tracks (Body Rap (a ... Fat Boys sound) Disillusion (an even ... Fleetwood Mac sound comes to mind), as a whole the album is excellent. One of my favorite moments is ""Bewilderbeast"", which calls STRONGLY to mind the Beatles' ""Flying"" from Magical Mystery Tour.. as everyone but me seemed to ignore that track, I'm glad to see it resurrected in a flattering (except for the last 45 seconds) form! Interestingly, the best songs close and open the album; The Shining is amazing, whereas Epitaph makes the album.Watch for some interesting, subdued use of horns in this album as well."
4,An Excellent Effort.,"This album is an example of what's going on in England that ISN'T in America.When listening to this album, I noticed the wonderful electronics behind the music and excellent mixing. But I also heard Dylanesque lyrics, and that's not something you find many places. BDB puts forth a good effort here, and I'd recommend it to all."
4,Antidote,The advent of BDB is the perfect antidote for blase radio programming and bands that still haven't been able to shake the un-original macho energy of Pearl Jam and Creed in their collective consciousness. Thank god for this!
2,Not as good as you'd expect,"Not bad, not great. 18 tracks and I'd say less then half are worthwhile. There's quite a bit of interesting experimentation going on here, but it's fragmented by long intervals of complete garbage. You get the feeling that this album wants to be an eclectic experimentation in the vein of Radiohead's OK COMPUTER, but it's nowhere near as epic or likeable. Simply stated, the production is horridly weak, the vocals are lacking and there's too much fluff (ie, too many accordion, organ, and sound sample interludes in between the actual songs)."
5,Goodly Made Album,"As you listen to the first couple of notes of Damon Gough's first album, you relize that this different yet very satisfying. This is very different from other albums released in the last couple of days and has a dash of Sgt. Peppers in it with the use of all the horns and strings. It has great melodies. And as you listen to it you understand why it is hailed as one of the best albums of the year 2000."
3,Moments,"Uneven, at times - and I write this w/o drama - frustrating. ""Magic in the Air"" might be the best love song ever. It might not be. The song to put on in a rental car as you drive the 60 miles to your meeting; Maybe it reminds you of something you would have said to someone you knew - or to some movie star that you met one night in NYC who liked you and then maybe forgot. ""I could have killed you with a karate chop."""
1,Over rated,"this cd is perhaps the single best of example of word of mouth being completely wrong. if you are a music elitist and enjoy listening to unlistenable garbage because it makes you feel cool then this is the cd for you. true, this cd does have a few decent tracks but even those become annoying when placed in the context of this terrible, terrible album. if you want to be ""hip"" and be able to drop cool names at your local coffee shop get this cd. if you enjoy good music you would be better off buying the new American Analog Set cd or Wheat's ""Hope and Adams"" which will win you just as many ""indie points"" but will actually move you as well."
2,What am I missing?,"Huh? What's with all of the hubbub surrounding this record? I've spun it about a half-dozen times now waiting for it to sink its shaggy hooks into me. Nothing. Doesn't even scratch my surface.Why this has landed on so many ""best of.."" lists, I'll never know. At best, this is twee-lite. I'll stick w/Belle & Sebastian, thank you very much."
2,ugly boy,"umm.. this album is fairly boring and typical kind of emotional drivel sort of indie brit-pop stuff. the best moments are when he sounds EXACTLY like elliott smith while the worst are when he sounds KINDA like elliott smith. geez, it seems there is always another mediocre british band around the corner to make the consumers feel that there is more to brit music than radiohead, Re: travis (who are actually better than most), coldplay, bdb, & cetera. ibought this album after hearing the video ""around the block"" or whatever (which i still believe is a great song) and could not believe how indistinct the rest of the album sounded. sheesh... i don't know, maybe i'm just being to picky, but probably not."
2,I've heard this before.,"Nick Drake, Belle and Sebastian and the Smiths all do it scads better than Damon.Even lesser lights, like Aluminum Group, Trembling Blue Stars and Starlet are superior to this overdone mishmash.Hey, first album, I know. As long as you stay away from Hugh Grant soundtracks you might be okay."
5,Wow,"I bought this CD somewhat randomly, after reading other reviews here. Then I popped this baby into my player, and it hasn't been out since. I have a really eclectic taste in music, ranging over many genres... and I absolutely adore this album. The songs are almost archetypal; they have gorgeous lyrics and harmonies. I can't speak enough praise for this album. I've played it for most of my friends and they all really enjoy it."
3,Good - but why all the hype?,"Well, my roommate and I have finally agreed upon an album we both like, with this decent debut from Badly Drawn Boy. She adores it, but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. After all the hype that seemed to surround this record, I was expecting something revolutionary - or at least evolutionary. Rather, it plays like a typical British pop record. The Beatles, Oasis and even the Stone Roses come to mind when listening. Don't get me wrong, the melodies are flowing and transitionary - I like the layers that seem to unfold within each song, but I couldn't help but think I had heard it all before. The piano that appears in some songs is a nice touch - it adds a bit of depth to a fairly predictable album. Overall, I would say buy it - it's better than most of the recycled garbage out these days - but keep your expectations low."
2,Liked Once around the block but the rest is overrated,"I bought this CD because I really liked Once around the block but unfortunately I do not understand the appeal of anything else on this CD. Admittedly I am not a big fan of Tecno nor Brittish Pop but I do like some of the tunes I have heard by Gomez, (also somewhat overrated). Who knows, maybe I'll put it in the CD player in a few years and see the light. For now it's going back in the ever growing stack of CD's that seem like a waste of time and money. For good pop music that you can sink your teeth into I would recommend Erik Matthews, Paul Westerburg, or Yola Tengo."
4,"Please Sir, I'd like some more...",A worthy buy: funky urban-folk music by a competent and intelligent musician. I am not disappointed with any of the 4 albums by Badly Drawn Boy that I own. Expect real-people music with a touch of humor and fatalism. Yum.
2,PJ T,"Enjoyment of Hardison's book depends on the purpose of your reading--for leisure or credit. I first read it as a requirement for a class I was taking and did not appreciate it on its face. It gives a picture of 20th century art, architecture, poetry and science. It offers up interesting comparisons of artist's oddities and scientists inquisitiveness and how each prejudiced the other throughout the century. It is an interesting picture. If you are familiar with 20th century art and technology but strive to gain a deeper understanding of culture and technological changes, this book is for you."
1,Not for pros; not for novices,"This book is of practically no use to individual investors and yet is too naive for an institutional investor. It's truly a painful read with the same concepts described over an over again. The 370 pages of text could have been reduced to 30 pages (give or take as I threw in the towel half way through) if all the repetitive explanations were taken out. You just want to scream, ""I get it!"""
3,The only book on this topic,"If you are interested in modeling things like price impact and total transaction cost of executing a large order, this book is the ONLY one you can find. This is not surprising given the narrow focus of this field. The book offers a systematic look at the different components of transaction cost and some pseudo-quantitative techniques -- I say ""pseudo"" because the equations are often of suspicious origins and often contain unforgiveable errors. If you want to know what VWAP means and how people implement VWAP strategies, you've come to the right place. If you want to know how price impact is defined and measured/estimated, you've come to the right place.Audience for this book are the people on the trading desks of mutual funds and hedge funds who execute large-size orders for a living. This book is NOT for small day traders, as there's nothing about making a profit from day trading."
2,This is it?,"I would think that a book about transaction-cost-reducing trading strategies would discuss market microstructure and quantitative methods. Nope. I am reminded of Paul Wilmott comparing math to mountain-climbing gear: too little, and you won't make it to the first camp; too much, and you will collapse under the weight midway. This one, not having nearly enough equipment, walks around the mountain. Don't look up."
4,"Works, but not with the Spin Scrub - get out the grout brush instead","This works very well in getting grout clean, but I have not had much luck using it with the Hoover Spinscrub. It cleans the floor just as well as the regular hard floor solution, but does not do much on the grout even when I used the grout brush.But, it works very well when you go at it the old fashioned way with some elbow grease and a grout brush. I've used it on both floor and counter tile grout (both gray) and it really does a good job. I dilute it at about a 5-to-1 ratio (5 parts water, one part cleaner) and use a spray bottle to apply it.For really stubborn stains, let it set a bit on the grout then hit it with a steam cleaner. Does a great job and has a decent fresh scent."
3,HOOVER GROUT CLEANER,"PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT OVERPRICED, FOUND A PRODUCT JUST AS GOOD AND MAYBE BETTER BECAUSE IT LEAVES A NICE ORDER IN THE AIR.IT'S PINK IN COLOR AND CAN BE PURCHASED AT SAMS, CALLED TILE FLOOR CLEANER.PRICED 1/3 OF THE HOOVER PRODUCT."
3,"Difficult to find in the stores, but Amazon has it.",This is the best cleaning product to use with the Hoover Floormate. I have white tile floors with light grout...and way too many dogs who have a very fond penchant for digging in the mud and running inside the house through the doggy door. This stuff is a must!I only wish that it came in a larger sized bottle.
2,Grout cleaner,"The Hoover Floormate Grout-Cleaning Solution didn't really do the job for me. I have a huge, cermaic tile entryway and the grout has taken a beating. I wanted something to get it a lot cleaner than this grout cleaner for the floormate could do."
2,Good Product But Nothing Different than Regular (and less expensive) Floor Cleaner,"We have a lighter colored kitchen floor with beige colored grout. With two kids and a dog, the traffic pattern has turned some of the grout much darker. I wanted to brighten it up and was hoping that this cleaner would do the job. I had been using my Hoover Floormate withHoover Hard Floor Cleaner, 48 Ounces, AH30100and liked how well it cleaned the floor overall.After going over the floor (slowly) using this cleaner, I noticed no difference in my grout. The reality is that this is much more than double the cost per ounce and should have made a more noticeable difference.I'll be sticking to theHoover Hard Floor Cleaner, 48 Ounces, AH30100at a more cost effective price and taking the time to occasionally hand scrub the stained grout."
4,Grout Cleaner,"The cleaner works pretty well, but it helps to make the solution a little stronger and let sit for a few minutes. Over all, a good product."
1,Does not fit the bill for large stone textured tiles.,"I bought this product in the hopes that it would help my new Hoover Floormate hard floor cleaner. (It is going back by the way as it does not work even with the grout brush block) The cleaner does not do any better than lysol multi cleaner or pinesol or any other cleaners I have used including my steam cleaner (Haan) turns out that the Haan is the least expensive to use and cleans better than this cleaner with the floormate. To be fair I did use the Libman scrubber on a stick with this tile cleaner in some areas and got the same results with just plain water. I am sad that this did not work. I really, really wanted it all to work. I have a new-ish home (4 years old) and I can see where the previous owner had carpets on the floor. (Another reviewer also had this problem) I also went over the floor 5 whole times. Just to make sure that somehow using the Haan never did a good job like I thought.. Sorry charlie, no such luck."
1,Disappointing!,I didn't have any success with this product at all. The grout doesn't look any cleaner than before I started. I'll stick with steam cleaning the grout.
2,Not as powerful as claims,"It suggest that it cleans grout, but I did not see a remarkable difference after using. Tiles looked cleaner but no change in grout."
1,Nothing in a Bottle,"Used as directed with FloorMate. Also used directly on grout with a brush. Used it full strength, used it diluted. Even let it stay on grout for about 15 minutes. No one of those methods did anything!! Save your money. You'll get as good results using almost anything else. Perhaps most disappointing product I've used in 10 years."
2,Just ok,"I thought it would clean the grout better than Clorox kitchen with bleach, but not as great, as the the clorox."
5,Can't Complain,"I bought this laptop seven months ago for $1500(after rebate), and I'm so glad I did. It has an excellent screen and battery life. It's relatively thin and quite(unless fan kicks in < 5% of time). I've also had no technical issues to date, and I've used it at work everyday. Originally I was kind of disappointed about the wireless range, but then I learned that I could download a newer driver off the internet. Now it has a much more reasonable range. I definitely recommend this product."
3,Good For flats!,IT works out for my shoes. I mostly have flats. My husband's sow hardly fits in them. We had to get a different rack for him. He is size 9/9.5. Very small. Looks good though. Matches my brazilian cherry redwood floors.Looks great but thats about it. I wish they came up with some sturdier shelves inside that doesn;t slip causing a mess!!
2,Big disappointment...,I'm very disappointed with this product. I have had it for a little over a month and used it daily to store my shoes and it is already broken. What a waste of money. It is made of particle board and feels very cheap. The hinge to open the door is plastic and has now become separated from the box itself and I have not been able to re-attach it. I wish I would have spent a few extra dollars and gotten a solid wood cabinet with metal hardware. I'll give it 2 stars because despite being horribly built it does look pretty good. Just don't expect it to last long if you use it daily. Also there is no way you will fit 3 rows of shoes in it. I can only do two rows with my size 10 shoes on the bottom and my wife's size 6 on top. The picture is very misleading.
5,Great design..easy to assemble,I had been looking for a shoe rack..without showing the shoes. I found this on Amazon and I am greatly satisfied with the design. One of my best buys on Amazon.
4,Fun and Frustrating,The recipes in this book can be quite exciting but really some experience in the kitchen is needed along with great patience. The typeset of the book makes it difficult to read and the quantities are not consistant. Sometimes you have too much stuff other times too little and you have to add ingredients. This is the same with his previous book. It seems as though better testing of the recipes and better proofing is badly needed. That being said the book is full of exciting things to serve and as is his style the flavors are well pronounced. If you can get hold of the chili powders needed this book is a lot of fun. As in the previous book many of the terrific relishes and sauces can be served on other dishes. Scores 7 out of 10 because the recipes are worth it.
5,A Master at Work,"Once again, Bobby Flay has produced another great book capturing his unique recipes. Utilizing ingredients that can be found at any major grocer, dishes are created with a pallette pleasing result. This book is a must if you enjoy Bobby Flay's cooking. I highly recommend this for those that can handle going where no other tongue has gone before!"
2,Bobby Flay,"THIS IS A LOUSEY BOOK FOR HOME COOKS. MORE FOR PROFESSIONAL RESTAURANTS.I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED, SINCE I ENJOY BOBBY ON THE FOOD NETWORK. FEEL LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY."
2,BADLY WRITTEN......,"While I was strolling through a book store recently I can across Bobby Flay's book. I had eaten at BOLO a few days prior and thought the food was pretty good so I said ""What the a Heck"", I went ahead and bought it. Even though the recipies are good, the way it was written is almost as bad as his speech and personallity is on the food network! I found it very hard to follow some of his recipies and bad luck for you if you dont live near an area where you can find some of the ethnic spices and ingrediences he uses that the recipies call for. Overall, recipies are ok but needs to be written better."
2,Midwest Cook found ingredients to spicy,"I guess I didn't think bold would be hot and spicy in every recipe, I cook a lot and love fresh vegies and grilling recipes, I have a vast variety of ingredients in my cabinets but could not conjure up enough for even one of these in this book. Too much work, really a disappointing selection. I will stick to Martha Stewart and Susan Branch, more my style."
2,Deteriorate Prematurely,"These deteriorate before I can get them in mouth. I usually put my vitamins in a daily container a week ahead of time. However, these tablets start deteriorating before I can take them. The pills should have a coating on them to prevent that. I don't have high humidity or heat & all my other vitamins hold up just fine."
2,Visual QuickProject Guide,Disappointed to find this was for the earlier version of Premiere Elements and it did not contain the new important features. The classroom training book by Adobe is far better.
5,Rio Plus Great Product,"I ordered the Rio Plus 2500 HP Aqua Pump for my 90 gallon pre-drilled fish/reef tank and have had it running about 1 month. I did a lot of research, which included calling local fish stores to see what they recommend. For the quality and price you can't beat this. The only small problem I had was it was a little to large for my wet dry when I had the bottom plate on with the suction cups. I removed the bottom plate and suction cups and set it on the bottom of the wet/dry.I didn't want any noise so I placed a piece of the filter sponge (About 1/4 in thick) under it and what do you know ""No Noise"". Also, don't worry about pressure, because it pushes the water great through the tank. So much water movement, it is moving my sand around. This is an excellent product."
5,Works great and it's quiet.,I replaced the Rio HyperFlow 14 for this pump. This pump is quiet when compared to the hyper flow. Works great and keeps up with the Eshopps overflow. Actually the pump was turned down slightly with a in line flow control. Overall I'm hapy with it.
5,Love It!,Rio has the best aquatic air pumps in my opinion. They always work well and last for several years. I will not buy any other brand.
5,Perfect Return Pump,This pump has been working awesome for about three weeks now. I am using it as a return pump on my 90 gallon reef tank and it does and excellent job and creates a little extra needed flow for the tank. It was a good price too!
3,"nice old whodunnit, aka frankie as charlie chan","This is a good story that moves along well. Set in California just before the war, a shipping magnate is mysteriously murdered. The sole apparent witness - the fiancee of his daughter who is also the son of his principal business rival - is accused of the murder. So Mr. Wong is called in, to help a hapless cop who is followed around by an aggressive girl reporter. It is a vivid cast of characters, the acting is quite good, and the suspense is believable (for the time it is playing, of course). It is fun, even my kids watched it with me, and the ending was hard to predict. This is the kind of film that was shown on Sunday mornings, which I watched with my dad, though more often than not it was the superior Charlie Chan.REcommended, mostly for nostalgia but also if you like old fashioned whodunnit fun."
5,Awesome Thriller,This one kept me on the edge of my seat until the ending. And who knew that Boris Karloff looked so normal when he wasn't dressed up like Frankenstein! The movie is about a guy wrongly accuesed of murder who is sent to the electric chair. Karloff plays the private eye who has to find the real killer before he is exectued. I loved this movie!
3,Not a toy!!!,"This is just as it says... a studded battle axe.It's not a toy, but a weapon. It's a great Zombie killer weapon.We bought it to use in a photo shoot, but deemed it too dangerous for that. I didn't return it because it was our fault in not reading the description.From a quality point of view, several of the ""studs"" in the handle fell out as soon as we took it out of the package. The studs are basically hammered thumbtacks, but they look good, when they've not fallen out.The pointed end comes with a cap on it and you'll want to save it, the pointed end is REALLY SHARP and could easily poke a hole in just about anything. I swung it very lightly and sunk it about 1 inch into a tree. The blade isn't super sharp, but it'd do some damage.Again - this is not a toy, it's a weapon. I would not recommend this for costuming or as a prop in a play or for photos, but if you have some other reason to have a battle axe - this will do the trick."
3,Hmm...,"I actually purchased this exact same ax from a small knife shop more than a few years ago. For show purposes, it is great to hang in the house somewhere. If you're into having some fun with it playing at knight or just want to hit stuff, it wont take much punishment. the top spike unscrews from the light wooden shaft and the ax head doesn't stay on there very well. You could try using an epoxy to keep it all together but that's no guarantee it'll work. also be careful with the handle. The ""studs"" are just heavy duty tacks and don't stay in one spot very well and could cut the hand. That aside, it's affordable and good for show."
3,Wedge not high enough,"This wedge was okay, but was not steep enough to help my daughter with her nightime reflux. We ended up purchasing a Med-Slant for an adult, then we only used the smaller half and that worked much better. This wedge is okay if you are only looking for a slight wedge."
4,Great book for anyone!,"The book Gratefully Yours brings the thoughts of a stubborn New York City tenement orphan into the wide and open prairie of Nebraska. This books main character, Hattie, is charming and loving. She learns the jobs of a farm girl, and keeps her knowledge from New York. I give this book 4 stars because of a suprise ending that I didn't like, but some people might."
2,Not happy with the album.,"I was expecting more from such accomplished writers. The songs themselves seem to drag on like they had no life of their own. The artist's themselves have had a tremendous influence on their owns careers as musicians, but together....they just don't go together. If you like the album, I'm happy for you. If you want more in an album look elsewhere...sorry."
2,The story of some dolls and their doll house.,"This book for young children was a 1931 Newbery Honor Book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best contribution to American children's literature. It's an unusual book in that, if a child has the reading skills to be able to read it, the child would probably be bored. It is probably a book to be read in installments by a parent for a young, pre-literate child about to go to bed. In addition, some readers may take offense at the characterization of one of the minor characters who is African-American. The story concerns a family of dolls, who occupy a doll house and become ""animated"" only in the absence of humans. They, and the dollhouse, find themselves marooned on an island. The author, in addition to the basic story, goes into some very nice descriptions of animal life on a tropical island."
5,One the best guides for business writers,"This large-format book, by a leading writing consultant, is dedicated ""to everyone who `writes for a living'-which means almost all working adults."" It's on the short list of recommended resources in my book The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Business Writing and Communication, and supplements that book very well. I recommend it highly to all business writers."
2,Not what I expected,I was looking for a match to the Cotton Candy yarn I already had. There are no dye lots persay for most of the yarn sold today. I realize that you can not count on a exact match but this was at least two to three shades off and it appeared to be a bit worn from moving around or maybe not being stored properly. I should have just chalked it up to a lost cause in trying to find a match for the yarn I but I was hoping for a passable match but it did not work out.
1,Junk,"It will not dispaly all your pics, even if you follow the idiotic naming convention they force you to use. The pics will open fine with a paint prg, once copied over to the flash ram card in the device, but the device will simply not display them.The ones that do display are dim and fuzzy."
3,Radioshack viewer,"Just a warning -- it doesn't run on batteries, which makes it hard to carry around and share photos."
1,Not Worth the Hassle,"This little gadget is not worth the hassle. Be sure you have an extra memory card for your camera because the frame will not operate without one plugged in. The contents of the box were not complete and I could not install the program to make this thing work! Too much of a hassle!! Next time I'm just going to invest my money on the nicer, BIGGER digital frames that work and come complete in their bundle."
4,"3.5"" Digital Picture Frame Photo Viewer","A very basic unit, requires accurate file numbering for play back, so one needs to be careful when renaming files. Since this was an early attempt, some features are lacking such as a built in powersorce which would have been nice. Overall it performs well and does what it is supposed to do!!"
1,Not worth buying,"Totally disappointed, will only display ""out of the camera"" photos, no larger than 6MP, won't run on batteries. Not user friendly at all. Not worth buying, don't waste a penny on this product, I'll give you mine. (dealer won't take it back)."
1,its garbage dont waste your money!!,"its garbage dont waste your money!!doenst work, the driver is useless, is not plug n playall lies! i`m dissapointed with amazon and radioshack, very bad produtc"
5,Excerpt of review from Choice,"""Mussi (Universita di Roma ""La Sapienza"") provides a welcome, fully documented, and well-illustrated summary of the earlier periods of Italian prehistory ending with the coming of the Neolithic circa 7,000 BCE..... A must for college and university programs offering undergraduate and graduate courses in the Paleolithic.....R. B. Clay,formerly, University of KentuckyCHOICEMay 2002 Vol. 39 No. 09"
5,The 'Citizen Kane' of Drunk Clown Films,"I'm only writing this review to repeat that great line, which I read in a review when this film first came out (HA,HA!). If I remembered who wrote it, I would surely credit them.It IS a great film, but much more in the 'guilty pleasure' sense. It's almost all in bad taste, although the 'message' is really pretty positive. Bobcat is at his hilarious best - a performance that makes you wonder -'why isn't he really big?' And YES! Fabulous cameos. It's incredibly funny from about the first minute on."
5,Haven't opened it yet...,"But my boyfriend will love it. Factory sealed and just what the description says. Can't wait to open and watch it. :)I know it may seem like i am trying the same review all over the place, but i did buy a lot of movies with Adam Sandler. :)"
4,cult classic,"not a perfect specimen, but dense with good comedy, classic lines, and dark dark humor. enter the alternate world of clowns at your own risk."
2,Shaky at Best,"Two stars because there's some good stuff in here. What a shame not to capitalize on such a brilliant opportunity for comedy. Some of the good gags show the potential for what could have been one of the funniest movies ever made. This concept is so fertile that the producers should have hired a team of writers to support Bobcat's script. Too bad, Bobcat could have knocked it out of the park with this one. One viewing is enough for me. Even so, there are scenes I'll never forget. Worth the effort of re-make. Maybe next time they'll use some former Seinfeld writers."
1,The Worst Movie I've ever seen,"I watched this movie a couple years back because I liked Bobcat Goldtwait humor. And my advice is to rent this movie before you buy it. It is dull and monotonous. This tries so hard getting laughs through slap-stick humor and sight gags that it trips up on itself and makes you think you were watching a B-rated college-created flick (a la Bob Sagat comedies) The drunken comedy is an absolute oxymoron in this case. If you feel like wasting a perfectly good Saturday morning or feel like torturing your little brother after getting a bad grade on a math exam, please watch this movie."
3,Shakes the clown,cheesey 80's flick about an alcoholic clown. not as funny as i remember! does have its moments though!
2,Not a good movie,"This movie is very strange and very low budget. There are ""clown"" bars, you can't follow where it's going."
1,don't believe what you read,"I did and got [pulled] in. I paid 22bucks for this and i can surely say that it's horrid. BOBcat drops the ball totally in the directing department leaving the film flat and deviod of any interest. NO pacing kills the film and the dialogue is absolutely purile. this is just not funny. I can't believe i paid 22dollars for this. damn. avoid like the plague. the simpsons clown episode runs rings around this. and just one more thing- this movie is just not funny. great idea, very poor execution."
4,The perfect comedy for the weird at heart,"Intelligently offensive, grotesque but never crude, this comedy is a masterpiece. You may not like it at all, but if you do, you'll be quoting lines from it for the rest of your life."
1,wow rent if u can,I LOVE BOBCAT BUT NOT THIS MOVIE. YOU Get a young unfunny adam sandler in this movie to as well as several other stars in there first movie. It has 2 decent funny sceens but seems to last forever if your wondering why you have not heard of this movie there is a reason I WISH i would have saved my 10 bucks.
4,"Surreal, funny, and well worth watching","I had to be dragged into watching this movie, convinced it was going to be awful. My friend Mike won me over with the argument that it was really surrealist humor, not slapstick. He was right, and I was floored. What makes this movie work is the fact that everyone takes the clown life seriously. If Goldthwait's character, Shakes the Clown, was an incompetent clown, the movie would have been pathetic. Because his life is portrayed as a surrealist lifestyle, with clown bars and clown sex, the humor works. Many of the jokes are funny on multiple levels, including the classic: ""Hey! You clowns are on dope!"" Ignore the critics. Watch this movie."
1,Dont bother,OH MY! This movie is so annoying that I was unable to watch past the first 20 minutes. DONT BOTHER TRYING!
3,No other choice,There is no other choice except this one if you want to watch the miniseries. Got it as a gift for my parents and they loved it. I am now watching it and it is as good as I remember. It would have been nice if they had improved the picture and sound quality - both are bad. I would think that must be possible with today's technology.
5,Masterpiece of TV Mini Series,What can be said of Rich Man Poor Man other than being one of the true epics of television. Peter Strauss and Nick Nolte are masterful in the roles as brothers. The series deserves to be watched by anyone who enjoys what television used to deliver.If there were 10 stars I would award accordingly.
1,Rich Man Poor Man: Book 1 (Region 2),"I was very disappointed in this purchase. No where on the ad to buy it does it say what type of media form to play it on. Consequently, I could only watch it on my computer which is not (at the least to say) a comfortable format to watch this mini series. Please make it very clear on the advertisement how a video can be played. I fully expected to see that the format should be able to play on any DVD player. I have only watched the first disc... and that was painful to sit at the computer to watch it. This wantsme to beg off ordering any future DVD movies from Amazon."
5,"Great, Great, Great","I have been waiting 40 yrs to see this again, and its even better then I remembered. Its amazing how much the issues going on back then (politics) are exactly the same as today. How money & power wins elections. The romance & intrigue really kept your attention and leaving something to the imagination made it so much more enjoyable unlike today's movies with full blown nudity. I fell in love with Nick Nolte all over again, but wish he had lasted longer thru out the series. Theres a stellar cast of so many good actors that I hadn't thought about in years. Thorougly enjoyable, and certaintly well worth the price."
5,Fantastic Mini-Series,I have not seen this series for 35+ years! It was very well written in 1976. That was the year I had twin daughters....so looking forward every week to see an epsode really brings back memories! QUALITY OF THE DVD'S IS FANTASTIC!!!
4,Super but 2 Objections,RICH MAN POOR MAN Was one of The Best Early Mini-Series Made/I Really Wanted It To Continue Into A Third Part//The 2 Objections That I Have Are That Some Of The DVD sound Quality Is Very Lowand You Do Miss Some Of What The Actors Are Saying--Woman Mostly//SomeOf The DVDS The Sound Is Fine So More Than One Person Must Have Worked On Rich Manand That Leads Me To My Second objection NO CLOSED CAPTION(SUBTITLES)This Series Really Needed It//If They Ever Redo RichMan With SubtitlesI'll Buy It Again//They Did It With Brideshead Revisited..The Original No Closed Caption But The New Version They Did Add Closed Caption//Stanley Cooper Jupiter Floridazoundz@bellsouth.net
5,Great series,"Great series. Good movie, what more can I say, it was a good movie as I stated in the title."
4,Richman Poorman,"This is one of the best series ever put on TV. Very enjoyable, could not stop watching it until the end."
5,Forgotten howmuch I loved this Movie.,"I loved this movie and had searched for it for several years.It did not disappoint! I had seen it when it came out yearsago, but it was like watching a new Movie.It`s full of drama, which is true to life. I would recommendthis movie to anyone who loves a serious and sometimes sadmovie, but also very ""sit on the edge of your seat"" drama. Youfall in love with some of the charactors and also dispise sometoo. I won`t say which so I don`t spoil the plot.So if you are over 30, you`ll love this movie. You have to beold enough I think to sit through it as it is several disc`sand I chose to watch several episodes every evening. My sonwho is 33 really liked it and you can`t wait for the nextepisode. At the end of every show, you are like, ahhhhhhhhhh.Love that sort of Movie. ...keeps you interested and alwayslooking forward to the next time you watch.I give this movie 5 stars! I would also recommend, ""The ThornBirds"", also thank Amazon, you delivered a day early...xxx"
5,Great tv serie,"I really enjoyed watching this tv serie and I'm glad that I bought it.I remember that my mother used to wacht it in 1976 when I was only ten years old and even years later, she was still talking about how great it would be if she could see the serie all over again.You can imagine how happy she was when I showed up at her house with the set."
1,Rich man,Ripped open the box to watch it - couldn't because it was PAL never heard of it!Could not return because of the way I opened it. Out 30 bucks. Live and learn
1,sorry,"The author of rm/pm was obsessed with sex and alcohol. I watched (2) dvd's and only one woman was not envolved in a sex scene.This is not a ""feel good"" type of series one could watch and not feel like you needed a shower to wash away the filth.I can't understand why this was not rated ""R"". Sex, drugs (alcohol), and violence. If it were an occasional use maybe ok, but it was in just about every scene. I wasted my money!!"
4,"Rich Man , Poor Man","I orginally saw RMPM Book 1 back when it was aired in 1976. Loved it then as a teen and it still holds up pretty good today. I also vaguely remember watching Book 2 when it came out. Book 2 has it's moments but, it no where near as good as book 1. I hated the ending in Book 2. It seemed while watching it, the last two chapters or so were hurried and the last scene left a whole bunch of questions about the main characters. Perhaps they thought they would do a Book 3? Probably better they didn't!"
5,The Best of the Best!,"I would have to rate this as the best mini-series ever produced. I recently got to see it again after about 25 years. I borrowed it from the library, which seems like the only place that still might have a copy. I recall when it was first on TV, I think it was an ABC Movie Event. Sitting each week enthralled in the storyline and then waiting for the next episode. This was the most thrilling thing to ever have been on television and it has stayed with me all these years. I became a life long Nick Nolte fan after seeing 'Rich Man, Poor Man'. I only wish this was on DVD! With all the junk that is put on DVD, why not something this ground breaking???"
4,Very pleasant,"A real pleasure to relive these wonderful hours with the Jordache family ! I had forgotten how ""addictive"" this serie could be !"
3,"Excellent Series, shoddy transfer","Grew up watching this series and actually had owned it previously on VHS. The series is an excellent adaptation of Shaw's book (which I'd read as well), so I was sad to see that the transfer to DVD looked like I'd copied it from my VHS tape (and not very well). The majority of the scenes are faded and look like they came from a copy that had been watched too many times, yet occasionally the screen will clear and it looks like it was ACTUALLY on DVD (these are few and far between).That aside, still worth watching and at the price worth owning."
5,We love it!,What a blast from the past. My husband and I originally watched this series when it first aired on television. Great addition to our collection. Thanks!
5,Dead on!,"Having spent quite some time over the past 25 years or so visiting friends and relations in Northern Ireland, my reactions to films that deal with the place run along a continuum of ""Dead Awful-Dead On."" This film takes a silly little idea and winds it up into a metaphor for all those people who attempted to carry on with their lives, surrounded by and in spite of The Troubles. It's loaded with inside jokes that those who attempt to bridge the divide will recognize and respond to immediately. I absolutely love this film, which tells us more about the people of Northern Ireland than all the useless politicians combined. Besides, this is one very funny film. Enjoy!"
1,"Piece By Piece, It Doesn't Add Up to a Full Rug","Still not sure why Barry Levinson decided to direct this film. Moreover, I'm not sure why DreamWorks decided to greenlight it. It was pointless. Yeah, there were a few moments where I laughed, but all in all, it comes very close to being one of those films that when it's over you really want to recapture the time you spent watching it. The most enjoyable part of the film was the outstanding cinematography by Seamus Deasy. Most of the characters that Barry McEvoy has created are very one-dimensional and the story just isn't engaging."
5,One of the funniest movies of all time,"I dont believe this movie got to much theatrical hype,i have no idea why! This is the funniest movie i've seen in awhile laughing outloud several times which i rarely do this movie is also more than laughs it has a great story there's plenty of reviews here for you to read about the story,i would like to tell you though the dvd is great there is no special features really except cast and crew info but the picture is great and it does support dts to my suprise upon purchase.A+"
3,a poignant depiction,"The cover of this movie is misleading, as it shows a globe covered with a hair piece. The story is a bit more local than this. It is set right in the middle of a volatile northern Ireland. But the hair piece is fairly indicative of the movie's geist. The characters and the story are original and memorable. Some of the plot twists and dialogue are downright hilarious. But what is most striking is depiction of northern ireland and it's volatile situation. There are many things in here that we americans, with our freedoms, would find impossible to live with. The movie itself is not violent, though there is a tension throughout the movie that is undeniable. It is a testament to Mr. Levinson that he manages to smoothly allow comedy to co-exist with such a backdrop as this. It's also a testament to the character and the will of the Irish people."
5,"Very funny, very sharp","DreamWorks buried this one in the theaters (there's a lawsuit by one of the producers claiming that the studio caved to political pressure from the British government), which means that most people missed this very funny, very sharp comedy. Nice performances from Brian O'Byrne and Anna Friel in particular, as well as a very amusing cameo from Billy Connolly as a psychotic wig franchise owner. Barry Levinson and Seamus Deasy contribute fine work."
3,If you like British comedy...,"If you like British Comedy, or better yet Irish comedy than you will no doubt be pleased by this film. Although I didn't like it as much as the Full Monty, or Waking Ned Divine, I still must admit it was time well spent. There isn't too much comedy in the film, with is why I gave it only 3 stars. The trailer seemed misleading. Besides the hilarious epiodes with a stranger on the sofa, and a bit including a dog, a tupee, and a telephone booth, there wasn't much more too laugh at besides the dialogue. As many of these films that are marketed they seem to end up being more of a dramatic comedy than they initially let on. However, if you enjoy films similar too this one you'll no doubt enjoy it. And the memories of it may have you chuckling for days. Take that, Mr. Black!"
4,Fabulous,"Tis a great movie about the Irish. I wholeheartly endorse it. The F word is used quite abit, as it is in Belfast.... Enjoy for a comedy along the likes of the Jerk...."
