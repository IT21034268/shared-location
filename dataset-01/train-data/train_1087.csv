3,Needed Bigger Diagrams,These are a ton of good puzzles. Only problem is: the puzzle diagrams are just too small.
3,Interesting yet hard to understand!,"This book contains 1001 ways to Checkmate as the title explains. Yet the 1001 ways are not taught to you, yet there are just very small chess boards with different positions, that I personally could not figure out. There is a very small amount of text to explain so many diagrams. This book is way beyond comprehension for a beginer, and I as a intermediate player, also can not understand half of the ""ways to checkmate"". I would only recommend this book to advanced players and those who might have a lot of time to TRY to understand the book."
1,terrible binding,"When I read another review saying how bad the binding was, I thought they were exaggerating. However, as soon as I started thumbing through it, the first four pages started falling out! Nice exercises, but I returned it b/c I know that I will not be able to use it with the pages so loose.Maybe you get what you pay for. The more expensive ""Sharpen Your Tactics"" by Lein is much more sturdy, though also much more difficult and not solely focused on mating threats."
3,"Lots of problems, some mistakes, Discriptive Notation","This book is PACKED with good checkmate problems to work on. It covers a lot of important themes. The drawback is it has some inferior ways of solving some of the checkmates (yup the author overlooked a few things!) and the book is not in Algebraic Notation. Other books to be considered is ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" by Snyder and ""Winning Chess Tactics"" by Serawan."
2,Buyers Beware,I felt obligated to write a review when the pages started falling out in the first 5 minutes of study. There are plenty of other quality puzzle books out there with solid binding. Dont buy this book!!
3,Good content - horrible binding,"This book delivers in the way of chess puzzles... but the binding failed the first time I opened the book. Though I look like a chess genius/madman (and I am not) when I sit around looking at pages stapled to the cover, its really annoying to try and keep the pages together. There are checkmate puzzle books just as good that probably have better bindings... definitely do not buy if you live in a windy locale."
5,Unrivalled Workbook For Your Checkmating Technique!,"The exercises are simple but sound. There are no comments, only diagrams (one of the advantages of this book). If Reinfeld had only omitted the silly attempts at classification (queen sacrifices, checkmate without the queen, etc.) that give unwanted clues. Knowing there is a mate should really suffice! Read Renaud/Kahn, The Art of Checkmate (Dover) first and then test your newly acquired skills with Reinfeld. I hardly doubt that after this workout you will miss many mating opportunities in your own games! One last advice: do notes to avoid superficialty in your analysis (not all diagrams are mate in two or three)."
2,Not as great I read in the other Amazon Customer reviews,"This book does show a lot of great patterns for checkmate. Unfortunately this is all the book does. There is very little text to support anything, just a brief overview of what type of checkmate that each chapter is going to cover. There is no text to support any of the solutions just notation on how they do it. The actual physical quality of the book I received is horrible. By page 12, 3 pages had fallen out of the front of the book and 2 from the back. The reason the pages in the back of the book are falling out is because you have to keep going to the back of the book to see the solutions to the checkmates. I have not been rough on this book at all, and in fact it is still in good condition except that the pages are all falling out. This is the worst binding job I think I have ever seen on a paper back book.Will I read it again? Maybe, if I feel ambitious enough to put it back together."
5,"Revies of Frankie Yankovic, The Early Years","I have been a fan of polkas and other ethnic music since the early 40's when I discovered it on the radio. In my area, western New York State, it was mainly Polish, German and Italian music. I had never heard of Slovenian music until 1949 when I heard Frankie Yankovic playing ""The Blue Skirt Waltz"" on the radio. I was awestruck, and bought the record!Since then I bought some of the earlier Yankovic recordings on the Continental label Thanks to Sunshine Diversified, instead of those old scratchy recordings, this CD provides me with cleaned up high quality recordings of those wonderful old tunes, 42 in all, of those early Yankovic years. The quality of the sound is amazing for its day. In fact I prefer the orchestration of ""The Early Days"" to much of Yankovic's later recordings, stereo and hi-fi not withstanding. This recording has preserved a very important history for future generations."
1,DREADFUL,"This sounds like Russian Lawrence Welk with some Tiajuana Brass thrown in. If you want good Russian Balalaika music and no singers hamming it up, then I suggest ""Art of the Balalaika,"" available again on Amazon. Much much better! Otherwise, content yourself with performers drowning out the sound of the balalaikas with almost every sound imaginable, with the possible exception of the washboard and the kazoo."
4,A SUPER INTRODUCTION TO A SUPERSTAR,"Sadly enough, with a catalogue rich in solid hits, many of the ""best of"" collections for Dolly fall short. Fortunately enough for someone wanting the absolute best, this grouping is just that. This assemblage of songs presents to the listener the very best of Miss Parton and leaves you wanting more. For fine complements to this acquire ""The Essential Dolly Parton, Volume One"" and ""Here You Come Again,"" the breakthrough recording recently rereleased (and the one that started the mania!)."
5,Hemo's the greatest,"The study of science, especially back in the pre-space program days, was encouraged and assisted by many corporate sponsors. Bell Laboratories was foremost in this area. Hemo the Magnificent made biology come alive for many children. I still love watching this film today and I use it extensively to simplify the heart and circulatory system as I teach in an allied health post secondary school. I have never forgotten Dr. Baxter or Mr. Carlson as they jolly along with the cartoon animals and Hemo himself. It is interesting to note the opening scene with Mr. Carlson having a cigarette dangling casually from his mouth and to espy such antiquated medical modalities as leg braces and the iron lung used so long ago during the polio epidemics. Nevertheless, Hemo is as fresh and pertinent to science students today as it was 45 years ago. It is unfortunate that Rhino no longer prints this wonderful film."
5,Scoop Away,I have owned this mini scoop for years. It makes the perfect sized cookies. It is also great for scooping batter for mini muffins or cupcakes. This was a present from my mother and now I am purchasing one for my daughter.
1,Not good quality,"I thought I would save a few dollars by purchasing this scoop, now I regret it. The description says it holds approximately 2 tsp., it does not hold that much. The scoop I received in the mail today doesn't even look new! I would not have picked this item up in a store. The metal piece that clears the dough from in the scoop is bent. The spring is tight and it's not a smooth contraction or release. I can't imagine how sore my hand and wrist would be if I made a batch of cookies with this terrible scoop. I will be returning this product. I haven't decided if I'll pick a different brand from Amazon or just order the Pampered Chef version from my friend."
3,soft cookie dough only,"I have several scoops of different sizes since I love baking. They work fine with soft doughs but if the dough is too stiff, the spring will come out and mess up your scoop! you have to relocate it and most of the time (when it comes to cookies) I just don't have time for it.. I'm in a hurry!"
5,Just what I was looking for!,Thank you for the fast shipping and a quality product! It was just was I was looking for.
2,A good price but not built well,I gave these as gifts with other items but when I used it the metal that swings around to release the dough isn't close enough and leaves alot still in the scoop. The handle was not comfortable in my hand. I used it to scoop my Almond Joy candy into balls and had a blister by the time I was finished.
1,sucks,this scoop was broken after I used the first time. It can not be used any more. I felt disappointed. Bad product!
3,Good,"Like this, but didn't realize how small the cookies were going to be...literally bite sized cookies. This isn't what I thought I was ordering, but I like it."
1,What's the Scoop?,"My Fox Run 1-1/8 inch cookie scoop broke the second time I used it. I just bought it in February, 2009, and I guess if the price seems to be too good to be true, it is. The scoop size was perfect for smaller cookies -- and rather than shell out $20 for a similar scoop, I opted for the Fox Run. Big Mistake! You do get what you pay for."
3,"Cute, but not so practical.","I purchased this Snoopy Bank for a good friend of mine who is having a baby soon. Her nursery is done in a baby snoopy theme. I wanted to use the bank at her Baby Shower for a tradition where everyone makes a wish on a quarter for the baby and then deposits it into the bank. An odd moment occurred when we went to deposit the coins and they didn't fit into the slot!! We had to pry open the plug in the bottom in order to put the coins in the bank! I will say that it is a beautiful bank, maybe a little on the small side, but it is meant to be more of a collectable figurine, I think. The mom-to-be loves it. But they really need the coin slot to be a bit wider."
5,"Another excellent ""spy"" novel","Alan Furst has the great talent of reinvigorating the ""spy"" novel genre. He creates atmospheric works, and places his well-drawn characters into the middle of the World War II murkiness of intelligence gathering and action. His main characters tend to be introspective, moody fellows, with women to match, and a cast of finely sketched and fleshed-out minor players. We're involved in the tangled mess of central Europe during the dark days of Nazi occupation, and we seem to move effortlessly from there into Paris and the French and Belgian countryside. These books are intelligently written, and create the wish that the stories would go on long after the book is finished."
5,Adventure Tale for the Thinking Reader,"The protagonist is a military intelligence cartographer in the summer of 1939; in the fall he must get $11 million in bullion from Warsaw to Romania to save it from the Nazis coming from the west and the Red Army from the east. He takes over a train, filled with as many people pleading to flee as will fit.But that's just the beginning of the book, despite enough action for a movie. The captain then is assigned to increasingly complex intelligence-gathering, liaison, and sabotage duties, all of which is beautifully written and believable. I won't give away the plot."
4,Very good effort,"Excellent Ambleresque novel of espionage set in 1939/40. The atmsphere of the time and the places [Poland, the Ukraine and France is created with a gritty, convincing realism. Clearly Mr Furst can write! His action is complex and interesting but perhaps too episodic.This type of novel can only succeed if sentimentality is strictly eschewed and Furst manages that almost all the time - the rifle toting Jewish violinist appears to be a stray from Captain Corelli's Mandolin and should have been edited out, but he is an exception.It will be interesting to see if Furst's work improves with time as Ambler's did. The technical [really engineering] facet which so enriches Ambler's best work is already present here, though in a different form."
3,what's the fuss about here?,"furst is overrated, but still...it's better than any airport/wallgreen's 'spy novel'...very close to lecarre...BUT unlike sir john, there is no real character here...in 'the honorable schoolboy', you actually cry for the hero spy who lives undercover...in this book, i had no idea why he put himself at such risk for so many different factions...no depth...but that said, a totally relaitsic (from what i understand) portrait of occupied poland and paris."
2,Good effort but flawed,Like most who have read Alan Furst's books I was captivated by his prose and his character development.Where he lost me was having the RAF flying Lancaster bombers in the fall of 1940. No doubt the late Roy Chadwick who developed the Lancaster is turning in his grave as the Lanc's first test flight in January of 1941 and it did not fly operationally until 1942.Furst is often given praise for his research but this blunder is something that should not have happened
4,A Good WW II read,"I have read a number of books by Alan Furst, enjoying them all. I pre-ordered this book and started it as soon as I received it. It was entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone interested the side bar events of WW II."
4,Realism,"This is an incredible story of unself-conscious courage. However, it demands a lot from the reader, too.You have to be ready for a simple, clear storytelling style which describes in convincing detail a very bleak, dehumanizing atmosphere where people have given up virtually all hope. War is depicted very unsentimentally and realistically, and heroism is outlined quite simple: a willingness to kill ""good naturedly."" Wow.The main character is drawn simply and powerfully. You'll enjoy getting to know him, and feel relief when you put the book down, too. He is capable of doing ""whatever it takes"" to win.Well-written and, from what others say here, historically accurate. It pays us to remember what WWII was really like, and what it demanded from ordinary people."
3,A little disappointing,"Furst is very good at depicting historical situations (occupied Poland, Paris under German authority...). However, that does not save the book. The plot is weak, based on three different and unrelated threads. Also Furst did not create a persona for his hero. In spite of all this, the book is entertaining and clearly above average."
2,Just did not like it,I just didn't like this book. Quit reading it at about page 160 because it flipped around too much and no good character development.Just plain poor writing..hi brow I though.bummer!
5,great norteno group !,Just got the tape by mail...great buy...this norteno group has been a challenge for me to find there rare recordings but I must say their norteno music is super..10++..great music for those who enjoy norteno music..I recommend Los Astros de China...!
3,simplistic but fun,"a very basic shoot-'em-up with only 6 stages. i found it fairly easy with the exception of the 4th boss which is annoyingly difficult. after you beat it there's a hard mode with more bullets but not all that much harder. as an early game boy game it's not bad, but there are a lot better shoot-'em-ups, even for game boy."
3,merry lil christmas,"I bought this for my niece, who (after 3 months) has yet to put it down...at first, she thought it was tiny, once we got the castle, she's been addicted"
1,a complet rip off,"This doll was as much a surprise to me as it was to my three year old granddughter. It i about 4 inches high. Actually I ordered the wrong doll. But, frankly, this whole Dora thing is out of control. It is not worth the money. I ended up buying her a teddy bear that she likes so much more. This doll does nothing. Just a lump of plastic."
2,disappointment,"One thing this release has going for it is very good audio engineering. The recording has great dynamic impact, very natural tonal balance (firm low bass, strings and brass appropriately bright) very good imaging). However I'm afraid I don't find Lopez-Cobos's interpretation of this music to be utterly compelling. This is not music that profits from an understated reading. I would say this effort compares very unfavorably with the best known interpretations, such as Maazel's brilliant recordings with Cleveland and with Pittsburgh, Karajan's Richly evocative Berlin recording or Reiner's tour de force with Chicago. So much for the Respighi warhorses. As for the ""Metamorphosoen"" that rounds out this release, I would say its obscurity is well deserved."
5,Speedy service,I love this album. I had it before and somehow lost the CD. Service from Amazon.com was Very Good. Recommend to anyone who needs an album and can't get to a store to buy it.
3,"Bobbie Nelson ""Audiobiography""","I really enjoyed the two songs when Willie joined his sister, Bobbie, but I was a little disappointed in the rest of the music. It was OK but nothing to write home about. I do appreciate Bobbie Nelson's skills and talents and her background music. Obviously, she and Willie together make the best team. Willie's songs, as usual, were outstanding. --Pastor Switz"
2,OK for the Neighborhood,Bought for long ride across Illinois. Valve stem pulled out on my son's bike during air up and valve stem broke on my bike. Not up to hard use with lots of hang pump airing. Fine for the kids' bikes.
5,Buy this now.,"If you are fortunate enough to have someone tell you about Foster and LLoyd (fans that already know of them own this already), but it now. Even if you need to buy a used copy.I have been a fan since 1987, and still listen often. With country music moving towards pop these last few years, it is great to hear progressive country. The songs are classic. Any fan will tell you that listening takes you right back to when you first heard them for the first time.Radney Foster is good, but as this duo, they were the best."
5,Masturbatorium,"This CD is everything that I had heard about it. The best part is listening to the Spiricom, which was a machine used to communicate with the dead back in the 1980's. If you want to know more about the Spiricom, google Spricom.com. The other parts of the CD has sexual sounds by Annie Sprinkle. Not her singing or other vocals. You will have to purchase the CD to know what I am speaking about. (smile) The CD is only 17 minutes long and just one track, but it's an intense 17 minutes..."
2,Same thing as Cheap Concealer Sticks,"This was a big disappointment to me. It is the same stuff as the cheap sticks you can buy anywhere- the greasy stuff. If you put on a little, it is okay for awhile in certain lighting. If you put it on using the spatula and rubbing it on thick like they say, it cakes and sets into the creases of your eyes. Don't waste your money."
3,just okay,"it goes on easily, covers well for first half of day. later on it seems to have lessened in the coverage. also i am a true medium beige skin tone but the medium beige cover creame goes on and looks way to light. i have darkness on my upper lip and with this it looks like i have a white mustashe. not good. i have tried to put darker foundation and power over it to hide the lightness, with no success. might be good if the color was closer to what i need."
2,very cakey,felt like i had a ton of crap on my face! I got this because I fell in love with loreal quickstick which is no longer available :( I thought I would try another loreal product but not even close.
4,Good coverage but wipes of easily.,Good coverage but wipes of easily. Waiting for the setting powders in original & saffron to see if it still gets on my hands and clothes.
4,"Dermablend Dermablend Cover Creme - Chroma 2 1/2 - Medium Beige, 1 oz","Dermablend Dermablend Cover Creme - Chroma 2 1/2 - Medium Beige, 1 ozTHIS COVERAGE WAS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE USED"
1,Orange and ugly,"This didnt cover not one of my 12 tatts ! The color is ORANGE and doesnt look natural at all . If you have black ink tattoos , forget this."
5,LOVE MY DERMABLEND!,IMAGINE HOW GLAD I WAS TO SEE DERMABLEND ONAMAZON.COM. IT IS THE B-E-S-T FACIAL DISCOLORATIONMAKEUP ON THE MARKET IN MY OPINION. I HAVE BEEN USINGIT FOR 15 YEARS. IT HAS A SILKY AND THICK COVERING SOTHAT YOU DON'T NEED TO USE ALOT. GIVE IT A TRY!
5,I use this as a concealer ...lasts all day,"I use this as a concealer under my liquid foundation. Great at covering dark circles, blemishes and my small scar on chin. To finish my look I dust dermablend setting powder all over after I apply my liquid foundation. My face looks flawless all day. So much in one container, will last a long time...but note I use dermablend setting powder with this."
3,ok product,The product arrived in record time and is as described. I would have liked a sample before I bought because the color is not right for my skin.
1,Not good coverage,"I have deep acne scars and expected this product to help conceal them since I had seen a video on Youtube about it working for someone else. I tried blending it on the back of my hand and then putting it on my face, but my acne scars look even more noticeable after putting it on (and I also put foundation and powder on over it). It looks too orangy and just doesn't hide the redness."
2,Can't camouflage a scar or birthmark.,"I bought it because I read in the website that it's a good brand to cover my scar.I have (a little raised) scars. The products just can't make it look natural.The scars also have discoloration and Dermablend don't cover it that well.In addition, the color shades in website are not identical to the real shades after I tried it on my skin at all.Waste of money.I also have a birthmark, the product can't totally cover the discoloration like it says in the website.It cakes up and become more noticeable."
5,Demablend,I have used this product for years so I am very happy with it~ My review is for the company I purchased it from online. The cost was less than the major department store I have purchased it from in the past~ We all like a savings!
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I have been using Dermablend for about 10 years with exceptional results. A little goes a long way so I have only recently had to buy new cover creme. I use Chroma 6. I have found that the added SPF has altered the colour of the cover creme, to where I now have a whitish/ greyish tinge upon application. I would much prefer the old formula as it has a truer colour."
2,Not for people with acne scarring,"I'm sure this product is great for people who have discolored, SMOOTH skin. It is a great cover for that. BUT it is not good for people who have acne scarring. It makes my face look cakey, and it just brings more attention to the scarring on my face."
5,Same as any vitamin,"My husband hates taking vitamins, but he's okay with this one. It's a typical vitamin, I take it in halves with another calcium as they're two different kinds of calcium, and I like to make this even. They go down fine, no creepy vitamin taste. Not much else to say. I'll be rebuying."
2,Worst calcium supplements ever!,"I cannot hardly stand to take these, but I ordered them and I will finish the bottle. They get stuck in the back of my throat and I have been taking supplements most of my life. I will stick with the chews...same brand and more delightful."
1,Not a good scoop,Bought my husband this scoop for cookie preparation. Didn't last very long at all. Don't buy it. Go to a restaurant supply store and buy one there.
1,Terrible product,"This is a terribly made product. I bought four for friends and family to make cookies for my wedding, and all four broke during the first batch of cookies. Trying to figure out how to get my money back..."
4,Fit the bill nicely,There are very few antique brass faucets available. This one fit the bill nicley in our bathroom that required a antique brass unit to match the existing tub faucet. No problems at all and reasonably priced.
1,Flimsy Cheaply Made Faucet,This faucet arrived with the wrong set of instructions in the box. We tried telephoning the help number provided with the instructions and discovered that the instructions were for a different faucet. We finally resorted to a plumber and that cost $250.00.
5,Lee Oskar Harmonica Key of D,"Harmonica came in on time and was well packed.Works just fine, and I will be ordering more in other keys."
5,Hear A Lee Oscar in D... In action... A Great Blues Harp!!!,"Length:: 4:11 MinsThe following song was one of 4 parody blues songs I posted in the old My Space Music days in 2007. Stinky Ray was my alter ego. Even though the song was a joke, I think it will give you a humorous and serious feel for how a Lee Oscar Harp in D sounds. Keep in mind that this harmonica was already 17 years old when I made this track. This was the harp I learned on and it finally is in need of an overhaul in 2012. The key of ""D"" is a great key for blues but if you want the most common key... Get it in the key of ""C""!!!"
1,Don't get this,"This book was very disappointing. I love horror stories and read anything I can get my hands on. The villian in this book is totally unbelievable and therefore not frightening at all. The plot is predictable and boring, in the end it makes no sense whatsoever. Do not read this book, I beg you."
1,What is going on here...,"I honestly can't believe all the great reviews of this book and this author. I tried Wildwood Road and was disappointed. The Ferryman is even worse. Not well-written in the least bit, this book has scenes that just don't work at all, and some of the sentences are so poorly constructed that I just had to shake my head in awe. These reviewers need to try some Robert McCammon to see what good writing is all about. And Martin Cruz Smith."
3,Has moments,"Mr. Golden can write thats for sure, and moments of this novel are as gripping as anything he has ever done but overall it isn't a killer. i had more fun with 'Night Of The Beast' by Shannon even though it cost more. I am somewhere in between those who loved it and the lady who didnt like it."
5,Tres' creepy,Very spooky and might keep you up at night. Excellent read and interesting use of classic Greek mythological characters!
1,"Great clock idea, poorly executed.","I bought this clock with the hopes that I would have an accurate clock and be able to see the time at night. Initial setup was difficult due to multiple steps and set buttons that are too small. If you're extremely nearsighted like me, the clock time numbers projected on the ceiling will be too small to see. Finally, the clock face is backlit, but ONLY if you depress the backlight button, then the backlight illuminates for about 2 seconds. Unfortunately, if you need the backlight, the tiny button is too small to find in the dark. This might be a good clock for a traveler - it is relatively compact and lightweight, and was clearly designed to be used with batteries. (The AC adapter is included, but almost appears to be an afterthought). I returned this clock for refund, and am looking for a better clock of the same sort."
3,Fourth album...a sleeper,"Mahogany Rush IV is not the strongest album they produced but, one can easily get addicted to all of the tracks on it. If it were'nt such a good album, it'd be available somewhere."
3,I like history,"As far as it goes, the movie was ok. IF I'd known it was a repeat of every TV history on the war was... well, I'd not have ordered it. Just wasn't anything really new or different."
2,Dont pay more than $2 for this DVD!,The DVD shows some good things but I had higher expectations of it on reading the title. Also it is too short. Dont pay more than $2 for this
2,Gladius what a pile of Trash,Hmm decided to purchase this game for the full price hoping that it would be worthwhilethe gameplay is awful Repetitive springs to mind every battle is the same there is no innovation and you spend the majority of the time using the same commands over and over againthe graphics are rather medicore and lucasarts should of used the gamecubes capabilities in a more better way.
1,i wish i could give it 0 stars,"this game is terrible. since it was from lucasarts i thought is would be third person and you woulde run around and kill everyone. boy was i wrong. its turn based wich is stupid!!!!taking turns killing each other?!?!?! whoever thought that up should be shot! the screenshots on the back of the box led me to believe it was a third person hack and slash, the rating says it has blood and gore. very little blood and absolutly no gore. the story line is terrible, apperently there was a big war that just ended so to keep the peace they open up a gladiatore arena. the graphics arent the greates and the gameplay is absolutly terrible. in conclusion this game is a waste of money."
2,really not that great,this game gets real old and slow after a day or two. i want more from a game that what this is.
5,ff tactics? NO it's better,"made a group of centorians who group atked. can customize your own fighting force. dead gladiators don't come back, fully customize their gear. i love it."
2,Beck Arnley 101-4815 Ball Joint,"This is the left side version of the Toyota ball joints I recently purchased here. This one had a ripped grease boot when we opened the plastic bag, so I had to purchase the Moog equivalent at a local auto parts store. BTW, the Moog cost about 50% more, but it was made in the U.S.A.I will be returning this part to Amazon for a credit."
5,CONNIE,"this is the best representation of connie smith out there. she always has always been the best, and always will be. she sings from deep within, like no other. she is truly a legend. awesome collection"
4,Great first half,"Maybe it's just me, but I found the first half of the CD to be outstanding. It was her earlier works. Very country. The songs played to her main strength: vulnerable woman. However, the 2nd set of songs didn't do anything for me. They kinda strayed from the country roots."
4,Excellent!!!,This was a gift for my mother on Mother's Day. She just loves it and listens to it all the time. She stated that when she listens to it that is was like going down memory lane.
4,A Very Nice Edition,"The songs on this CD are not as great as the previous Lion King, but if you're a Lion King fan, please pick this one up.My favorite songs on here are:He Lives in YouUpendiShe Believes in YouSong of the ChildrenWe Are One (by Angelique)I Want to See the MoonThe Lion Sleeps Tonight (Lebo M.) -a major improvement in my honest opinion"
2,"A few good songs, mostly rehashed Disney fluff","As big a fan as I am of The Lion King (and Disney music in general), I must say that this soundtrack is quite substandard. The music from the film is, fo the most part, not catchy or unique; the supplemental music 'inspired by the film' has serious problems (a few of them are just Lebo M's pitiful attempt to broaden his listening group, as they have nothing to do with The Lion King, or even Africa in general). Ironically, the two songs that I enjoy from the CD are the 'inspired by' selections (Anjelique Kidjo's rendition of ""We Are One"", and a song that is mysteriosly attributed to Lebo M, ""I Want to See the Moon"" (Lebo is nowhere to be found in the song, save far in the background near the end).Save your money."
1,Worst Gregory book ever,"Let me start by saying that I'm actually quite a fan of Philippa Gregory, and was quite excited when I found this out-of-print book in my local library. And by the end, how happy I was that I'd not spent a penny on it. This is, quite possibly, one of the worst books I've ever read. The protagonist is a selfish, vain, hateful girl who -- I would assume -- the reader is supposed to sympathize with. Everything she does -- every horrible, malicious thing -- is purely for her own pleasure, and to advance her own status. Never once does she think of anybody else as anything other than a stepping stone, and abuses everybody she comes in contact with and then cries out to the universe for pity on her.I seriously only read this book to the end in the hope that when I got there, I'd get to see the protagonist die a horrible death."
1,This book is filthy!,"I have read many of Philippa Gregory's books and enjoyed them all, until this one. While I realize none of the other novels are clean, I was surprised at how dirty this book was. This is nothing but erotica, and the writing was terrible. The characters kept having the same conversations over and over. Not much here but sex."
2,"Why, why, why did she write this ending?","I absolutely adored The Other Boleyn Girl, and I finished The Constant Princess in a few very looong nights. Perhaps it was foolish of me to assume that this book would be as amazing as the others, but when I was finished I was angry that I had devoted so much time to a novel that was not only slow, it had terrible resolution. Really, there's not much to recommend about this novel. If you are just picking up a Philippa Gregory book for the first time, do yourself a favor and start with the Boleyn Girl, not this one!"
1,Extreme disappointment,This is the first book I have ever put into the recycling before finishing. It was so bleak and discouraging that I didn't even want to put in a yard sale. It was so depressing that I felt compelled to write about my feelings before someone else read it without warning. I have read many other books written by Philippa Gregory they were all insightful and intelligent. The main character Alys is not a female character that I would like my students to explore as she is so weak and her choices mere reactions to her circumstances. She is a puppet to the whims of others.
1,very bad read,I have enjoyed Gregory's novels of the Tudor era & expected this to be the same. How disappointing! It's like medieval porn. I could not even finish it. I would never recommend this book to anyone. I'd like to removed from my Kindle as I don't even want to own it.
2,Wise Woman,"Even more so than Wideacre, this book was disturbing. I agree that Alys is not a likable character, even thought she kind of redeems herself (in my eyes) at the end. The sex scenes and witchcraft is so twisted that it gave me the heebie-jeebies. However, I think it was necessary to create the plot, and make Alys' story unfold into one of desperation and regret. Gregory does a good job in making this crazy story work and showing us inside the character's minds."
4,The Wise Woman,"I have just started the book, but as usual Phillippa Gregory will not disapoint me... If this is your type of reading you cannot go wrong."
4,The Wise Woman,"Interesting story, well written a little strange though, but it does give a good read."
2,Ugly,"I yield to no one my admiration for Philippa Gregory, but I suggest fans pass on this one. What an ugly book, full of yucko sex and unattractive people. If you want soft porn, there are better books. And that's what this one is."
2,I'm sorely disappointed,"The other reviews for this book were so good, but I was really disappointed. I love her other Tudor books, and this one didn't even come close. I never felt any emotional connection with the characters, or even between the characters. Then again it is difficult to feel any sympathy or attachment to a cruel and self-destructive character, like the main character, Alys. The story wasn't nearly as fleshed out as say, The Other Boleyn Girl. I would not recommend this book."
1,How unfortunate,"I, like many of the reviewers, have loved Philippa Gregory's past novels. I have read The Other Boleyn Girl twice and am a big fan of historical fiction. This book was unfortunately very difficult for me to enjoy. Alys lost my sympathy somewhere along the way, and when you can't root for your ""protagonist"" anymore, you know something has gone a bit wrong. I wasn't even able to finish this book all the way. I began to skip around and eventually just read the ending because I lost interest.Let me just say that I am an avid reader and pretty much always finish a book I'm reading. When I am unable to do so, it means the book must be pretty bad. I just didn't really care what happened to the characters anymore. I am hoping that her next book is better than this unfortunate installment."
1,Just dreadful,"Had I read the one star reviews before I read this mess of a ""book"", I could have avoided it. I agree with everything here; not a character you like, a totally unsatisfying ending, although, if you make it to the end, you won't care. Even the sex was weird and blah. The worst book I have read in years. AWFUL."
2,So disappointed.,"After reading Philippa Gregory's entire line of historical novels surrounding English royalty, I enthusiastically picked up The Wise Women. Not a good move. While Gregory is a masterful story teller, this particular story is twisted and dark and sometimes nauseatingly obscene, and I was very disappointed. Various strings of the story were never even resolved by the end of the story (what happened to the wax dolls?). And I hated the very ending...it did not redeem Alys in my eyes and seemed an impetuous move on her part, not true repentance. Many of Phillipa Gregory's characters have both good and evil qualities (Anne Boleyn), and I love that. No matter their faults, I sympathize with them. But I found nothing in her capricious character Alys I could identify or sympathize with. So sorry I read this."
4,A Very Good Book,"As with all books I've Read from Philippa Gregory, I was impressed and entertained. I really enjoyed reading this book, although it was not my ultimate favorite of her novels"
4,As intoxicating as it is vulgar,"This book is not only intoxicating and bewitching but also vulgar and even nauseating. The book is extremely dark. Its hard to put down this book because you constantly want to know what happens next. Its easy to forget that the main character is a 16 year old child. The sexual scenes are hard and dark and leave you with a lump in your throat. The authors writing is beautiful. Her descriptions are vivid. Its a wonderful book that draws you into its spell and leaves you in awe.This story has no soft egdes, as much as you don't want to leave this story, you also feel glad when its done. Read it, experience it, be bewitched by it. I definantly recommend this story to the not faint at heart and those who like a story with teeth."
2,Did she go on an extended vacation?,"I would not recommend, and I have read the Philippa Gregory Henry the VIII series, to the point I could not wait until they were published.I was angry when I finished this book because I made myself read it despite the idiotic twists and turns. I cannot believe Philippa Gregory herself wrote this book. She had to have had someone else write it. It is awful. No one with an ounce of talent, and this includes Ms. Gregory, had anything to do with this book."
3,More mystical than the others,"This book has a lot more mystical elements than the other books that Gregory has written. I did not get as ""wrapped up"" in the character as I have in some of her other books, but it is engaging none the less. There are surprised elements, and the ending is unexpected. I like this book for the fact that when you are done you are not quite sure what your opinion of Alys is. Was she really as bad as her actions portrayed her? It's worth the read."
1,if you want porn. get it.,"i don't want porn going on in my brain. this was one of her worst books. i didn't even finish it. it was very graphic & sexual. i couldn't take it. my husband even read some of it & said, lets get rid of this book. disappointed."
4,Wise woman novel,"Good book. I like historic fiction and this is the way I get my history ""fix"". I admire the research that goes into these books, something I never would have the patience for. Philippa does a great job!"
1,Disappointing,"After reading several of Gregory's other novels, The Wise Woman was disappointing. It is dark and not as artfully crafted. Reading it was like watching a 1 star film...you keep hoping it will get better, but it doesn't, and you feel like you've wasted your time."
1,Never give a book away,"I am a big fan of the author and have almost every book she has written. And as I like to read books over and over again I never give them away. I was so disappointed in this one that I sold it in a garage sale as a protest as to how bad it was. The characters were not belivable, their was no sympathy or understanding for the main character and dark is not the word I would use (as I am also a Stephen King fan). It was just awful."
2,Not Gregory's Best,"I have thoroughly enjoyed several of Philippa Gregory's novels. However, I did not like this one. It started out interesting enough, but just got weird. When I finished this book, I just shrugged."
1,Very disappointing,"I've read other Philippa Gregory books and found them extremely well written. But this one was very disappointing in the fact that she goes far beyond anything that could be called reality. I like to read things that at least ""could"" have been true for that time period. This was NOT!!"
4,What you expect from Philippa Gregory,"I couldn't put this book down. I know it's one of her first books, but it's the reason why I started reading this author. I wish she would go back to this type of writing. The story was very good and held your attention. If you are a true Gregory fan, you want to read this book!"
3,"Enjoyed many other Gregory books, but...","Philippa Gregory is a storyteller, no doubt about that. I've enjoyed several of her other books (White Queen, Red Queen, Earthly Joys, Virgin Earth, The Other Boleyn Girl) but this one doesn't live up to those standards. The main character, Alys, is intriguing but the conflict between her faith and her sins doesn't come across well. She seems to much prefer her sins with her faith only a vague nagging now and then. I didn't care for the ending, either, as it was abrupt and ""didn't-see-that-coming-at-all"" type of thing. It didn't fit the character as there was virtually no connection between Alys and Hildebrand at the end. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I'm rather sorry I bought it."
2,Did Philippa Gregory really write this book?,"I have read almost every book that Philippa Gregory has written and I know that she has dealt with some rather dark themes in some her novels like Wideacre. I am all for authors seeking to plumb the depths of the human psyche, but I am at a loss as to why the author thought this book was worth the effort of writing. I say effort because it seemed to me that Ms. Gregory was trying really hard to complete this text out of obligation rather than for the sheer joy of writing it. Some of the text seemed forced and the plot bordered at times on very bad romantic fiction. Honestly, I barely got half way through the novel, before I got sick of the lead character and her odd voodoo candles."
1,Disappointed in Oregon,"What a disappointment! I am a big fan of Gregory's work and have read most of her other books. This one, however, delved into the occult in a sickening way. Unlike ""The White Queen,"" which makes the supernatural a beautiful, mystical background, this one left me disgusted and shocked. I threw it away."
2,I. Hate. Alys.,"I didn't really enjoy _The Wise Woman_, and I think that's mostly because I hated the protagonist, Alys, so, so much. Her first act within these pages is one of selfishness and cowardice. I chalked it up to the harrowing circumstances, and hoped she would be more sympathetic in the rest of the story. No such luck.It might have been fun anyway, if I could have reveled in rooting against Alys, but I can't stand the other characters either. The whole novel is an endless, joyless parade of nasty people doing nasty things to each other. It got dull rather quickly.The best part was the ending, which dovetailed with the beginning in such a way that I wondered whether I was meant to think that Alys had never escaped the first situation at all and that most of the novel was a fantasy she dreamed up as her fate closed in. I think I'm probably overthinking it, though."
3,Like Anne Rice - Spooky story,"I bought this book at the airport to pass time, then saw the back and forth reviews and was intrigued enough to finish and make my own opinion. I would give this a middle rating because, while it's well written and flows well, the story is a bit disturbing. It's very spooky and definitely is not a typical happy romance. It's a realistic view of how women were treated, except for the magic components which are either interesting, fanstastical, or just plain silly. The relationships were disturbing and Alys' life is very complex. Definitely makes you think about life and love. Imagine if Alys had been in today's world? Her life would have been VERY different and she may have been a very successful story, although still perhaps a ""tortured"" soul."
1,I actually recycled this book with my daily newspaper!,"I have never read a book that I wouldn't, at least, put on the bookshelf at my beach home for someone to enjoy... even books that I did not enjoy. This is the first exception and it is possibly be the worst book I've ever read.I am a huge Philippa Gregory fan, having read most of what she has written. This book is uninteresting, has unsympathetic characters and is really poorly written. I did finish it by skimming through the last 150 pages because I assumed that Gregory would redeem herself somehow. She didn't.Read any other Gregory book, but skip this one!"
2,Disappointing,"I have read several of Philippa Gregory's books and loved them. This book was a struggle to finish, I lost interest, I was grossed out by the whole wax figure thing and I never identified with this selfish, shallow character. I love her books because she champions strong women living in difficult times, but Alyce although she started out well got boring, predictable, and wierd. Instead read Lady of the Rivers, excellent read."
2,Don't be a fool - avoid The Wise Woman,"I normally enjoy this author's novels, but this one was too weird for me. Alys should have taken this book with her in the end of this story."
2,Not so wise women,Loved the book until the end. So disappointed. I have read all her books and this one was not anywhere near as good.
3,Awful Ending,"I love Greggory's books. This one, however, had a slow beginning, a captivating middle, and a horrid resolution. I still cannot believe the ending - but, if you're looking for something out of the ordinary, this is it. Just don't expect to enjoy it."
5,entertaining read,"Philippa Gregory has become my favorite author, this is an entertaining read, I am working my way through all of her books"
2,Not Philippa Gregory's Best Work,"I am a huge Philippa Gregory fan and have enjoyed all of her ""queen of England"" novels, so I was totally prepared to like this novel, too. Unfortunately, ""The Wise Woman"" is not one of her best works. In other Gregory works where the main character is less than sympathetic, her incredibly story-telling still captivates one - a prime example is ""The Red Queen."" Unfortunately in this case, neither the characters nor the story are engaging."
3,Informative,"This biography is well written and researched. Unfortunately, it becomes painfully clear at times that the author, Robert Alan Goldberg, is writing from the Left. The book's strengths lie in his discussion of Goldwater's family history and upbringing. On the other hand, Goldberg's rants on Goldwater's racial complacency get old after a couple chapters, and do not relent. Goldberg essentially accuses Goldwater of turning a blind eye to racism, but then defends him by saying he himself was not racist.Of course Goldwater was not racist. He did not ""accomodate"" racism, either...Goldwater just wasn't a ""Civil Rights"" activist like Goldberg, but then again, who is Goldberg to judge a man such as Barry Goldwater? When he sticks to the facts, this book is good. When he strays, it is awkward. Overall, though, its at least worth borrowing from the local library."
5,I found what I've been looking for.,"I've used a chore chart system to reward my older child since pre-school, and needed to find one for my youngest now that she was at that age. I finally found this on Amazon, and am quite impressed.It's on a full magnetic sheet, so it sticks firmly to a metal surface. This also makes it easy to write on while it's up. There are plenty of spaces to list responsibilities, and they're big enough to fit in basic chores. It's meduim sized so it doesn't take up your whole refridgerator front. The colors are pleasant, and design engaging for children.The pen has its own magnetic holder that can stick anywhere, BUT the pen itself is junk. It's well inked, but fades out to gray within moments of writing with it. Buy a decent marker to go with the chart. The pen holder will unfortunately only hold a slim style marker, and I haven't found a dry erase that fits."
4,Good carrier!,"I've used this carrier a few times now to hold my 5mo old, 16.5 lb daughter and it works very well. It is a strong, well made product. I don't experience any back, hip, neck or shoulder discomfort when holding my daughter with this carrier. My daughter seems to like it too and enjoy being carried close to mommy like this."
3,A nice read,"I found this book an enjoyable read with charecters that were both real and enjoyable at the same time and often funny. Although the ending was not the usual tied in with a bow happy ending, I would recomend this book to anyone looking for a good read with interesting people in a difficult time of thier lives known as the teen years."
3,I couldn't get into it.,Clicking Beat on the Brink of Nada is a very popular book with at the time of this writing 22 five star ratings and 5 four star ratings. However it just didn't grab me and I couldn't get into it.
4,Almost a book about Nada....,After the glowing reviews of this book I had to read it. The 1st half of the book were very difficult to get through. It took labor to change the page and keep going.. I found everything weak - from the characters to the descriptions to the story line. Then it was like a different writer took over and finally I was compelled to keep going and finished the last 1/2 in one evening.The characters felt like cardboard to me - no depth and realness. The writer has an awesome vocabulary and a good command of the english language but I felt like more time was spent on picking the right words than focusing on a captivating story.
2,Not for me,"I hate criticizing anything that could possibly be a beloved piece of work. But I must warn you: you might not like this book. Certain people certainly do--if you agree with its particular kind of existential philosophy and admire the kind of youngsters Trotsky and Cody are, notebook-scribbling free thinkers--then gay or straight you will probably appreciate this novel. If not, then stay away. There's not enough love, affection, and warmth here--not even that lowest common denominator, hot sex--to hold your interest."
5,It's true: This is a classic coming-of-age novel,"From all the reviews I had read and the buzz I had heard, Clicking Beat on the Brink of Nada was presented as a classic gay coming-of-age novel. And it is, indeed. Well-drawn and well-rounded characters, wonderfully penned text that brings the people and locales to life, and a story that, in the end, is beautiful, tender and, sadly, heartbreaking. Like all great coming-of-age novels, this one is authentic, true-to-life and honest. No gimmicks nor dramatic license. I really connected with the lead character, the teen boy with the humorous--and foretelling--name Trotsky. His trials with coming out, first love, and how his mother's political views affect him and his family are written with great care. I loved this book, indeed one of the best coming-of-age tales you will ever find."
1,WCS-2070,"I have 4 other IP Cameras and have had no issues with them (Trendnet). Unfortunately my wife ordered this camera for me as a surprise and I cannot get it to work.Level1 webpage is not very good for support, I have emailed their support twice with no response, there is no phone number on their site, the product came with 1 page of instructions with screen shots that did not match the software, the downloaded manuals do not match the software, the install wizard sort of works (it allowed me to change the ip address and setup wireless but I cannot connect to it or change the port) There software once downloaded the newer versions include: setup wizard, surveillance console, remote live viewer, ip secure main console. All of these recognize the camera but any attempt to connect to the camera gives an error. Followed their manuals word for word and step by step with no luck."
5,Very informitive from the authers prospective.,I really got an insight to the way John Locke must have been thinking at the time
5,Great book!,Excellent book! Read it the first time in 1967 when my father and brother went to Vietnam. It inspired me to join after my first year of college. I am now 62 and enjoyed just as much this time.
3,USMC Reading,"Good insight into USMC training, lingo, lifestyle, Regiments & WWII Pacific battles. Kinda found all the dialogue a bit tedious but suppose it was necessary to develop the main characters. Read the Haj & Trinity some years ago & really enjoyed them!"
1,A bad book.,"Of Uris' books, I have only read ""Trinity"" and ""Exodus"" which were wonderful books. This book was horrible. The dialogue is amateurish at best. It is not worth your time."
2,Good book - not as good as other Leon Uris's novels,"This is probably the best book I've read about Marines, but compared to Leon Uris's other books it isn't really worth reading until you read all his other books, and I've read all his books except for two, so hopefully my recomendation may be wort something. Of course, if somebody is interested in Marines this is a great novel to get the 'feel' of marine life during World War II and in combat."
5,Today's writers could learn from this writer...,"how to tell a story and not be cute about it. This 1953 novel was so refreshing compared to what I've been reading lately. You won't find any quirky dialogue here with a non-existent plot and a writer obsessed with convincing the reader just how inventive he or she is.This novel is what telling a story is all about. You'll be dissapointed if you are looking for the inside joke, with a smirk on the face type writing that so many publishers yearn for.Excuse me while I'll order a few more books from Leon."
4,Excellent yarn about the boys in green!,"This is a well done story. A little dated, but still a good story. It is told from several points of view. Primarily from the squad sargeant who is a Marine from the pre-war years.I read it when I was younger and really enjoyed. I picked it up this time out of curiosity. I'm glad I did.It's also a good history lesson about the morals and ideals of this period in time."
4,Surprisingly good,"""Battle Cry"" surprised me. I had not read a Leon Uris book before but had found this one at a second-hand bookstore and decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did. What works best here is the vivid depiction of life in the Marines, whether it is the boot camp scenes at the beginning or the battle scenes at the end. The only disappointing facet of the book is the simplistic and somewhat corny depictions of most of the book's romances. Otherwise, I found this a highly satisfying read and an intriguing peak at a past era: military life during World War II."
2,Crazy in Love - Just Crazy,I was pretty disappointed in this book. I know that it's an earlier work and I'm thrilled that Ms. Rice has gotten soooo much better. I will continue to buy anything new that comes out but will be a bit more choosy in purchasing from her backlist.
1,RUN the other way!,"This is the absolutely worst book I have ever read in this genre. Scratching your finger nails on the chalk board would give more satisfaction. Don't even waste your time, there are so many other books out there!"
4,Crazy In Love,I think this is one of the strongest and most wonderful stories I have read. Family is not near as important today as it used to be. Makes you stop and think and appreciate those who will love and know you better than anybody else. I have read this book over and over. I have gone so far to buy the movie and watch regularly.
1,Very Dissapointed,"The first book I read by this author was Cloud Nine which I couldn't put down,it was great.I then read more of her books and they were o.k,but this one was extremely boring I kept reading it thinking I was soon going to get to the good stuff but I never got there.I realized that all of her books are similar they all take place in the same area,all have an artist in the family,a dead unfaithful father or husband.I'm afraid of picking up any of her other books I think I already know what they're all about.This author just doesn't seem to have the steam to be creative."
2,"I agree, It's Crazy!","First off, if this is the first Luanne Rice book you've picked up, STOP. Go back and get Summer Lights, Blue Moon, or Home Fires, then come back to this selection. Georgie needs the therapists couch and quick, or Nick will be looking for greener pastures. There were many sections when I'd just shake my head and think, ""If this were my husband, and I was this neurotic, he wouldn't want to put up with me!"" What's with cutting the cake during the Fireworks display on the 4th of July?? These women need to get a grasp on reality and learn to deal with change.Now, after writing all that as though these characters were real people (ha) the book had a pretty good flow and kept me reading. I guess I thought something major was going to happen, and it never did. Like I said at the beginning, pick up some of LR's other selections, you'll be glad you didn't waste your weekend on this one!"
4,Crazy about Luanne Rice's story,"CRAZY IN LOVE was an enjoyable read. If you like the slight wackiness and comforting domesticity of the late Laurie Colwin's novels, you'll enjoy CRAZY IN LOVE. This was my introduction to Luanne Rice, and I am looking forward to reading her other novels."
2,Not believable,"I like Luanne Rice and have enjoyed her books. This book simply wasn't believable. Yes, you can love your family, but her portrayal of this family was over the top. My mother has dementia and is in an assisted living home. It is a wonderful, compassionate place. Georgie's obsession with her husband and family just got sickening as the book went on. Rushing home from Nick's family to be there to cut some cake wasn't fair to his family. Her other books are much better. I wasted my money on this one."
2,Sadly disappointed,"With the plethora of books of WWII aviation continuing to come out as the generation dies off, there may be a willingness to publish some just because the author was there and took the time to write. The good thing is that there are a lot of books to read on the subject, unfortunately this is not one of them. While I was very curious about what the author wanted to say, the poor writing style caused me to give up by the end of the first chapter. There are a lot of books out there on WWII aviation, I wish I had time to read them all, but I don't and I set this one aside to use the time to read something that had been edited."
5,better late than never,Picked WRONG STUFF up about 13 years after first published..have read a great amount on the Mighty Eighth this one is a worthy classic - will enhance your knowledge of the campaign and fill in details missing from others.Truman Smith- 36 missions -really overwhelming to me.God Bless Truman Smith!God Bless these brave men!jack
2,Good story. Awful writing and editing,"Truman Smith's flying adventures in WWII are interesting, although perhaps no more so than a number of other authors' recollections of the period. This book could have had four stars if there had been the slightest effort at editing. A good editor could have corrected the grammar and eliminated the ridiculous use of exclamations, quotation marks and CAPITAL LETTERS in a couple of days. It reads like the writing of a junior high student. ""TOO BAD!""."
4,"Fascinating read, off-putting style","I found the book fascinating - and I'm sure that anyone interested in WWII aviation will appreciate the fresh and vivid scenes described by the author. The reader is given real insight into the feelings and experiences of a young man thrust into vicious combat. It is certainly an honest account - the author pulls no punches in describing his fears and immaturity at the time.On the negative, I found his writing style rather off-putting with a super-abundance of capitalisation and italicisation.Nevertheless, I regard the book as a valuable addition to my library."
1,the wrong stuff,This is the worst book that I have ever seen If this smith is a writer I think I wiii start writing . I am throwing it in the recyle.
1,What Happened To The Sound Quality?,"I was excited to get A Night On The Town in a special edition. I love Rod Stewart's first couple of Warner Bothers albums. This is now the third time I bought A Night On The Town On CD. This is not to mention my two album copies when the album first came out. The Remaster from 2006 is clearly better sounding than this release. Even when I adjusted the volume of the 2006 remaster and this new version, the 2006 remaster still has a cleaner crisper sound. Warner Brothers also messed up Atlantic Crossing at this time. When they expanded the live album awhile back, they also messed that up. My original had much more punch. It's bad enough Warner Brothers has milked me five times for the same music. Can't they at least get the sound right?"
2,Mute: a relative term.,"The quality of the design seems quite good. It fits on the bridge almost perfectly. Unfortunately it barely deadens the sound. Being a musician, I could only tell that the sound was slightly less bright. My roommate could tell no difference what so ever, him being the reason I desired a mute makes this a disappointment. I would suggest otherwise either finding a practice room, or purchasing a silent cello instead."
4,good until the end,"Alive and kicking is an intriguing detective story with an unsatisfying ending. You could say it just ends to soon. A pi hired to follow a cheating husband becomes an eyewitness to murder, the man hes following ends up dead and the pi comes face to face with his own past when the mystery hes mixed up in takes totally unexpected turns. I wont give away the end but i will say i thought it was a bit to abrupt. I recommend the book anyway."
5,"The hippest, real country CD ever. This boy can sing!",I can't believe this album has not been reviewed before. Why are so many talented country artists being ignored? Keith Gattis gives a decided George Jones interpretation to ten great tunes of his own composition. I dare you to hear this collection and not consider it one of your all-time favorites. Every cut is A+.
1,"Tape defective, got stuck and hard time to remove it!","Poor quality - tape was defective and did not rotate. As soon as I put it into the camcorder, it spun for about a second and then the dreaded C32:00 code appeared!The tape does not turn properly even when manually wound - seems like a defective product.I would stick with Sony V825LCD Camcorder Cleaning Cassette 8mm.Amazon return was great - they accepted the return quickly and promptly refunded item."
5,Great statement for simple entertaining!,"I started looking for these mini-kettles when I saw them being used as soup bowls on a food show. I thought the presentation was excellent. I looked around the internet and some of my local stores and found Amazon to have the best price at the time.I ordered four of them and think the quality of the kettles is very good. So far I have only ""entertained"" myself with them, but am looking forward to seeing the reaction when I use them for guests."
5,Great for pot pies,"We bought a few of these, and instead of making a big pan of chicken pot pie, I made individual servings in these pans. It didn't look like a very big serving until you started eating it. It was more than enough for one person. I put dough both inside and on the top of the pie. The only thing to watch is the legs. It's a little tricky to arrange the legs on the wire racks in the oven!"
4,Cooking for One,"This thing is small. It will probably heat half a soup can -- maybe 3/4s -- without boiling over. It heats fast, and I like cooking with it better than my aluminum pot. The trade-off is, of course, the weight."
5,favorite book,"Exemplary story-telling. The Inuit storytellers who created these tales made them to be re-told, to be laughed at, gasped at, wondered at, by ordinary people. Millman has done a service to readers. The ghosts of the original Inuit storytellers are undoubtedly more gratified by Millman joyfully sharing these tales with you and I, than by university libraries full of unreadable line-by-line literal translations prefaced with lengthy ethnographic ""context."" These stories can speak for themselves, and Millman allows them that.I prize my rare and expensive academic Inuit ethnographies. But I simply love reading this book. These stories were meant to be enjoyed and shared, not just stuffed and cataloged.JNH"
2,More About the Reconquista and Less about El Cid,"I was disappointed in this book. I was looking for an Osprey treatment of the wars centered around the late 1000s in Spain with a particular emphasis on the battles and campaigns of El Cid and the monarchs and rulers he served. What I got instead was a boiled down version of a survey course on Spanish history over three centuries and little mention of the Cid (OK, there's *A* plate of him and his death and a couple of other activities are mentioned in the chronology but since he was the lead in the title I had expected more than that). If you are a historian, avoid this. If you are a wargamer, get it only if you need a few of the illustration plates for the period. I don't really feel like it is worth [what] most people ask for it used. Bad Osprey, bad, BAD Osprey!"
4,Moors and Andalusians,"This title examines the Reconquista from both the Christian and Muslim sides, showing the organization of their military forces, their armament, and their history. The plates are excellent, and also give an idea of female and civilian costume. The book says very little of El Cid himself, however (following the tradition of Nicolle's books with 'Arthur' and 'Attila' in the title)."
3,Fun but unrealistic,"I had a lot of fun reading this, but 2 whoppers stopped me in my tracks. May I just say, without spoiling the plot, that (1) no one just finishing his thesis would be appointed head of a department of a university hospital and (2) there is no desert in Nicaragua!"
4,"Good writing, but the American dialogue isn't very ""American""","I had enjoyed ""Olivia's Luck"" by Alliot and really found this book to be a good read as well. The themes are similar in some ways to her other novels (cheating husbands and the wives that learn to pick up the pieces of their own lives). This novel is both humerous and heartfelt.The one thing that bugged me (repeatedly) is that the dialogue of the Americans in this book was completely British, save a few obvious American slang words. It's hard for me to believe that this book was editted to retain such British sounding dialogue coming from a 13 year old kid or the American doc. Even the doctor's diagnoses weren't spoken as an American e.g. ""compulsive obsessive"" instead of obsessive compulsive.Still, this book is worth reading."
2,Airball,"The author bravely attempts to bolster Arnold J. Toynbee's reputation by looking at him as a prophet rather than an historian. The most coherent essay is ""Toynbee Looks at Education"" which has little to do with prophecy. You can attempt to prove a person a prophet by faith or scripture, or by a tightly reasoned argument. The author has done neither. One star for content and analysis, one star for good intentions."
4,Very easy to fly,I bought this for my three year old and she loves it. Its very easy to get flying and is very durable.
4,"Loud, Clear and Easy To Use","I've used Hohner Marine Band harps and a couple of other low end brands and every single time I find Lee Oskar harmonicas are so much better. I can't imagine anyone would be disappointed.They hold up great, they play louder and the notes bend really well.When all is said and done, I reach for these when I have a choice. Looking forward to filling out other keys with these whenever I can."
4,Last Fool Here,"Local, Washington, D. C. rockabilly musician does a nice job. Some slow stuff, and some fast stuff. Album doesn't get boring. Covers of a few greats, such as Buddy Holly and Johnny Cash, and some (as far as I know) original stuff. The title song is excellent tears in my beer ballad. My personal favorite is the uptempo lament, Coulda Shoulda Woulda. It has hit potential."
3,"BUDGET Collection, but get the box set...","Fine 10-song collection, nice remastered sound, but The DUKES OF HAZZARD theme is re-recorded with a new 3rd verse. The line about 'fightin' the system' is replaced with something about showing his hands but not his face on TV... Great for the car, but really, the box set covers his career better."
2,Cheap,"How can you take any reissue seriously that markets a song, ""Just to Satisfy You,"" as a duet with Willie Nelson only to have it end up being Waylon's solo version from the 60's. Now, being a Waylon fan, I could never find the duet version on CD anywhere. I was so happy when I found this CD. And I was furious that it wasn't the version I was told it was. Plus there are no notes, recording dates or anything except an ad for ""The Essential"" which if I may add, also sports the original ""Just to Satisfy You"" instead of the duet with Willie the song list says.Go for the ""RCA Country Legends"" and don't even bother with this one."
5,A classic,"This is the classic study of the chaotic relations in Indochina from the end of the American wars there in 1975 through the escalating hostility between China and Vietnam and Vietnam and Khmer Rouge Cambodia. It ends in 1985, in the middle of the Cambodian stalemate.The presentation is vivid and the research is solid."
3,Masterfully minor moments,3 1/2Progressively lingering compositions capture an essence of sophisticatedly ephemeral synergy splendidly without leaving much to hold on to after the fact.
4,Magical,"I used to wonder if Monsarrat desrved his outstanding reputation; years later, reading this book has convinced me he is one of the few masters of seagoing writing. He manages to convey the wonders, fears, joys and hardships of the sea graphically. Monsarrat weaves an absolutely original and moving tale in which the central character, Matthew Lawe, though flawed and sometimes cowardly, engages your understanding of how tough it is to live up to other peoples expectations. Running through the story is a magical thread holding together many of the great stories and people of the sea through the ages. A great read."
3,Cheap but effective,"I only need this tool for occasional use and didn't want to spend the big dollars for a Dremel. It works OK but it feels and performs like a cheapy; it vibrates a lot at some speeds, and the case and cord shout CHEAP, but I like the extras it came with. Beware the wire wheel it comes with; mine flew apart in no time. I bought that box of 20 for 10 dollars from Anytime Tools; much better quality. Still, a good deal for a variable speed rotary tool for occasional use."
4,Great For The Price,"I've never owned a dremel-type tool before, but was in the market for an affordable woodcarving tool to use for carving pinewood derby cars and such. This tool did the trick right out of the box, without the need to buy any accessories. The included flexible shaft was very useful for carving. The quality of the tool and major accessories seemed as good or better than any power tool I've had for under $50. The minor accessories - carving bits and the like - were not high quality, but were useful and met my expectations for the low price point.This tool does not include an adjustable chuck, so it wouldn't be good for jobs that call for frequent swapping of the bit. It's not very powerful so I wouldn't use it for heavy duty work. For shaping pinewood derby cars -- which are about 7 inches long and 3 inches wide -- it worked great."
4,Gets The Job Done,"Lacks torque but otherwise a Very Good ""bang for the buck"" rotary tool.Recommended."
4,good stuff at the price,"I haven't used it since I received it. By looking at the product it's of OK quality, but for a causual user like me it's quite enough. And the price is great!"
5,Blu-ray is awesome!,"I'm quite pleased with the Panasonic DMP-BD10AK. That said, if you're now in the market for a high-end Panasonic Blu-ray player, I suggest you wait for the just-announced Panasonic DMP-BD50. The BD10AK is discontinued and it's replacement seems to be the DMP-BD50. The DMP-BD30 looks nice on paper but it seems to be targeting a lower price point (ie. fewer features).I went with the BD10AK because I needed the analog decoding built into the player as I have an older AVR that cannot decode the new higher definition audio formats. With the BD50 now announced, it is best to get that instead."
3,"Nice design, good work, region problem.Sometimes boots slow.","Well the title is pretty much what I want to say.When I play DVD, Region 3(Korea, China, and some of the Asian countries except Japan) cannot be played even though Region A is now included Asia.Titles like Die hard 1,2, it needs like 1 minutes to read the disc.The product itself is a little too big still comparing to recent DVD players. Also the remote control is too big as well.This is my first Blue Ray Disc Player so I cannot compare with other player, but not totally satisfied so far, so I give 4/5 stars."
5,Awesome,"I have this and Bluray. Both a good. I have no complaints, this is a better pc of equipment than the Panasonic Bluray I have. Also, Toshiba sends you the firmware updates.Panasonic requires downloading and burning to a CD. I hope HD wins, but bet they both survive."
4,Good entry level BD player,This player is great. It has above average picture quality and the load times are considerably faster than the Sony BDP-S300. The remote control is abysmal. The button layout is counter intuitive and it's difficult to even find a menu button. I would highly recommend using a 3rd party universal remote with this player.For those looking for solid performance at an entry level price this Panasonic is worth a second look.
4,Panasonic DMP-BD10AK 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player,The picture quality is great. I'm not sure if it is designed that way but it makes a clunking sound when ejecting the disc.
3,Burned into my brain,"I used to throw parties for kids and this CD would put them into a trance. I think Frampton's talking guitar subliminally speaks to them. But I must say that the songs are not bad. My personal favorite was ""Stripes."""
3,worked well for a bit...,"I found this shampoo after suffering from scalp psoriasis for over a year. Up until that point, I had tried all the normal over-the-counter shampoos you find in drug stores (neutrogena, selsin blue, denorex, and the list goes on). This is the ONLY one that did ANYTHING at all for my condition. And within a few weeks, it had completely cleared it up. I used it every day and followed the directions, leaving it on my scalp for at least five minutes.However, after several months, the effects wore off and the symptoms returned, though not as bad as before. I still use it almost every day because I feel that it controls it somewhat but I am looking for a new product."
3,So-so...,"Sadly, this product didn't do much for my psoriasis. The itching and the dandruff became worse. Despite that I would like to say that it does make hair soft and manageable. Of all the medicated shampoos I have tried, it's the best one for that. I'm sorry this product didn't work for me though. It might still work for someone else."
3,Helped me somewhat,This stuff cut down drastically on the flaking but my scalp and face still had red splotches. Not as bad as it was before but definitely still there.I recently used T/Gel by Neutrogena and I like that better.
1,made my scalp worse,I bought this shampoo rather than spending a few more dollars on Nizoral AD. I was excited that this was not only a shampoo but that it had conditioner and no smell. What a mistake! It's made my scalp worse than it has ever been before. It brought on itching and scaling that were not pre-existing conditions. I'll be shelling out the extra cash to get Nizoral AD from now on.
1,Ordered but not recieved,"I would like to say I liked this sander, but I ordered it on May 13th and just received the second notice of delayed shipment. If the sander comes after this new delay, it will have taken two months to get it. My suggestion would be to find someplace else to order it. My dissatisfaction with Amazon grows with each order."
3,Availability info is unreliable,"I ordered one on Oct 3. At the time, ship date was estimated as a week to 10 days.I was notified on November 4 that the order was still delayed, and they wanted confirmation that I still wanted the item. I check the website that day, and it indicated that the item usually ships in 24 hours.It has been three days since then. My order status has finally changed to ""Shipping soon"", so I am hopeful that I'll get it in a week or so. I would have expected that my delayed order would have shipped on the same day that they changed the website to read ""Usually ships within 24 hours"". Apparently it is more important to get new orders than to fulfill existing orders.I'll submit a real evaluation when I actually have it in my shop."
1,"You have to get it, to use it","I ordered this item on Dec. 8th, 2004. I asked for 3-day shipping to get it sooner. HA! It is now Jan. 4th 2005 and it is on its 2nd deferred shipping date of Jan 13-15th. Any bets that they make this one? I asked for some assurances but received none. -- So what good is a good price if you never get it?"
3,C+ at a high price,"My Delta crapped out after 3 years, so I decided to go with Jet, due to the fact that every Delta has been a disappointment. The Jet sander is a bit pricey, $300 more than the Delta comparable model. First of all the tracking needs to be adjusted, and I mean adjusted..., every time you change belts. I ruined one 180grit belt in a few minutes. Also, if you have limited space, this requires ample room to navigate if you use both belt and disk, plus hooking up to dust collection. It seems a bit underpowered, eventhough it does complete most of my tasks, just hope I don't burn it out. One of the reasons for the purchase was the 5 year warranty, a plus. Anyway, not thrilled, but gets the job done...just watch the tracking."
1,Got food poisoning from this product,"I bought these because the Wild Oats roasted sunflower seeds were not available. Boy, I got sicker than a dog on these. A bunch of the bags smelled rancid (I did not eat anything from those) and the other ones did not smell as bad but made me pretty darn sick (for 3 days).Double yuck. Bad experience. I wrote the company too and gave them the lot number. Not sure what happened, but bad seeds and I probably won't buy another product of theirs either."
5,Great teaching method.,Excellent book to teach chess to beginners children or adults! Bought it for my nephew and liked it so much I bought one for myself!
5,Awesome book!,"Fantastic book, makes it so easy to learn the moves. I knew almost nothing about chess two weeks ago when I got this book, and after less that 1 hour I could understand all the moves of the pieces, and even how to set up the board correctly at the start (white on the right, right!). My teacher told me about Chess for Children, and he was right, i'm really enjoying chess club now."
2,Nice Kiddie Book with Nice Picutres but not for an older kid like me,"I like the colour in the book, the pictures and illustrations after very nice, indeed!However, I did not fancy it as a book for someone over 8 years old (I am almost a teen). The reading level is for someone my age, but the design for someone much younger.Therefore, after our family took off on a vacation and we stayed at Cork Harbour, the car was the best place for it, stuck it in the boot!"
4,Nice Primer For Children,"Considering the target audience, the book, complete with illustrations, serves as a nice primer for a child who is a stranger to chess. Murray Chandler compresses a lot of information in a concise, clear way. I'm all for anything to get children interested in chess. My only two gripes -- and they are minor -- is that, considering the target age group, using ""i.e."" instead of ""that is"" isn't wise. And when one considers part of the goal of the book is to teach children to write in algebraic notation, using the infernal figurine style now popular in textbooks is counter-productive and unnecessary. That said, a parent could easily overlook those two small issues and buy this book with confidence."
3,OK for KIDS,"I was hoping for a little more background in the STORY content of Medieval Lifestyles and characterization to ""match to"" the pieces and movements in Chess... I had to sort of fill in those missing pieces of the story background and find other pictures for the children to relate to the knights and castles and people .. and then jump back to the ""Chess for Children"" text book... It DOES explain the movements well in child form - for an adult to TEACH and an older primary student to FOLLOW ..."
4,Good First Book on Chess,"I enjoyed it because it does a good job in telling you about the rules of chess and gives you some strategies to. It has good pictures and was enjoyable to read. A sixth grader will probably not like it as much as a second grader because of the lay out, but it is still good for both of these ages."
5,Excellent primer,"This book is an excellent place to start teaching children chess. I almost gave it four stars because I don't think children under 7 or 8 will be able to tackle it themselves without an adult. It would still serve as an excellent guide for older children and teens and with an adult's help any younger child would love it. It has great outlines and pictures of how the pieces move, the rules, special rules (en passant for example) and can be referenced easily by anyone. Great job by Mr.Chandler."
4,Not Six Hats,Tactics at times feels like a sales tool for Edward de Bono's other books or major premises put forward in those books and in that sense is hard to recommend. It also at times feels rather drawn and arguably is a few pages to long. But I got a lot out of the interviews and quotes of the people interviewed for this book. In this respect it provides great value to the reader willing to persist with the text and it is filled with jewels of information and thinking you'll be able to take forward in your own life and be a better person because of it...for this reason it is worth the read.
5,Rock-n-Roll Lives!!,"Finally, after years of regurgitating Eddie Vedder (yawn) sound-alike tripe, Seattle offers up real rock-n-roll. Call it glam, call it punk, call it late 60's psychedelic, WHAT EVER! This is the genuine article. They have the guts to roll out a bump and grind rhythm in Metro and have the brains to explore other musical instruments through the album. The irony in Better Way Down is sharp while Give me Back Yesterday is an honest ballad.These guys are the heirs to the throne of the Ramones.Long Live Rock-n-Roll!!"
1,"In light of their previous stuff, this album is terrible!!","I'm a long time fan of this band and the first time I heard this album, I was completely bewildered. With the exception of ""Too Many F**kers On The Street"" - which really rocks - this album is just SAD. The other reviews seem to keep saying that the band has grown as songwriters, but it sounds like they've been castrated as songwriters. I've seen this band live many times and they perform high octane, tight, fast and fun garage rock like nobody else. While I can understand a band wanting to spread their wings and try something new, this one is a giant miss. If you want a good Makers album, stick with Howl, All Night Riot, Hunger, or their self-titled one with the giant middle finger on the cover. Avoid this one at all costs!!"
1,longlegs the heron,"The company said it was in good shape. When I received it the cover had some big scrapes and one palce is almost all the way through the cover. The pages are water damaged. I would have advertised that it was in fair condition. I still would have bought it if there had been no more available, but would have gone with one that was advertised as good condition."
5,Candiria shows creative melodies like no other band has...,"The first time I heard Candiria, I couldn't believe their creative style and insane lyrical flow. It's simply a great performance on the cd and live. They are great live, and their CD is different from all death-core bands. You can't label this band into any category of music. The only category they fit into is ""great"". They go from insane and sick metal beats and screeching vocals to funk and jazz beats and even a little hip hop. If your into all kinds of music-death, funk, jazz, hip-hop, etc. then buy this CD. They are open-minded to all kinds of music and cultures, which is my favorite thing about them. Both cds are phat. They are one of my favorite bands and have pure talent. I give them mad respect for being so different and creative. Candiria's score is a defintite 5 stars."
5,if u lke creative metal than you will love this,"There is just one word that can describe Candiria....AMAZING! they are one of the best bands out there. If you like bands like Meshugga, the dilingers escape plan, and coalesce then u will love candiria."
5,definately one of my favorite cd's ever,"This cd is definately one of my favorites. Hardcore lyrics that drive into the depth of your own mental awareness, and beats that make you wanna start a mosh pit whenever you hear `em. Teaming up with the Lalalogists to make a couple rapcore songs, that are equally awesome, this band is summed up in one word: talent. Definately check these guys out!"
5,a classic self help text along the lines of Neville,"I bought the book in an used book store years ago, and found it very helpful in a practical way of achieving goals and dreams. Especially useful is the information on ""HOW"" (to get from where you are NOW to Where You Want To Be). I have 'Counted to Four' many times, and will continue to do so. Also, this ""Jim Jones"" is NOT the one of Guyana infamy. The copy I own is autographed and the signatures of the Cult Leader Jones is totally different, plus they don't even look like. This Jim Jones was 40 years old in 1957.. the Cult Leader Jones was 26 at the time. This is truly a book worth owning, if you can find one. It is unfortunate that years later some weirdo would have the same name and perform tragedies."
5,Good stories.,Out of the three Countess Julie is my favorite. But I had a great time reading them all. Was doing research fora project and was pleasantly surprised.
5,earl thomas conley in general,"Just a word of advice to anyone out there looking to purchase music by ETC. ANYTHING THAT YOU BUY WILL BE GOOD. I was listening to one of his cd's and was struck by the realization that this man has not written ONE song that I DID NOT like. He just doesn't write (or sing) a bad song. If you are really looking to buy and can't find it here, check out ebay.com using ""earl thomas conley"" as your search criteria."
5,One of the greats of country music,"I live about 5 to 10 miles from where Earl Thomas Conley was born and raised and he is a great artist. He had many hits in the 80s and early 90s but he is forgotten now. Some other reviewers said Earl has lost his voice,but, that is not true. In fact, he has a new album out this year consisting of mostly re-records from his own catalog caled 'Should've Been Over By Now'. He also has a yearly concert in Portsmouth (where he was born) and all money from ticket prices and such go into the Earl Thomas Conley Scholarship Fund, which helps kids here in Scioto County and Greenup County in Kentucky. Buy this album and here an underated legend."
4,Good Album!!,"Good old country music. He had a lot more hits than I remembered. If you like the old country, I think you will be happy."
1,"Geez, what a scam...","Many books are available online through university libraries as well as Google books who have taken their time to digitize rare books that have long been out of print. Neither HardPress nor Kessinger (or any of the other so-called publishing houses) actually do anything more than print what they find (for free, mind you) online and sell it here. Save yourself $15 and just download the book from Openlibrary (.org)and print this book out at home or go to Kinkos and have them do it for less. Google books actually has the entire ""Nation-builder"" article from the periodical Greenbag : Vol. 19, no. 1-3, 5 (Jan.-Mar., May 1907) ; p. 1-9, 98-109, 137-146, 265-276. Just search ""James Wilson Nation-builder"" in the free e-books section and enjoy."
2,you get what you pay for,"i recieve this item broken, i order 2 one was in good condition, the oter came in pieces out of the box. it more trouble for me to return it so i kept it for parts"
4,:) and :(,Good------Still 16:9Inexpensive (at least at amazon)Bad ----------Even cheaper packaging with double sided discsSTILL EVEN AFTER 10 seasons NO SUBTITLES!
2,Season Broken Down Into Two Parts,"I hate the fact that the season dvd set is being broken down into two separate sets. They've always only been one set why do they have to split it now? I'm MUCH less likely to continue purchasing the seasons to follow if they continue to be broken into more than one box set. It's just stupid to separate them even though there were quite a few more episodes than usual, and they've started breaking the show down into little like mini-series sets."
1,book cover,"A cover illustration that is off by a thousand years creates a credibility problem. Imagine the reaction if an author in China wrote a biography about George Washington, but the cover illustration had him wearing Abe Lincoln's outfit. The artist and publisher would be scorned for not doing research. Accuracy in visual and costume detail is every bit as important as accuracy in content."
1,looks like a trashy novel cover,I seriously agree with the other poster. how could the book jacket looks so terribly off? it does say something about the content when the book cover references Qing Empress Dowager Ci Xi and not Empress Wu of the Tang.
1,Oh Please!,Melodramatic and angry... Ranting and biased... Subjective and shallow...Lacking in any useful insight. It comes across as a vindictive diatribe against those who have hurt her. What a waste of money.
4,Pleased,"Bought as a gift. Detail in painting was done well. All in all, nice of your a Wizard of Oz fan."
5,Great info for all children,"My grandchildren, and godchildren love this game, even the younger ones listen to the older kids and learn the correct responses."
3,Not Bad,"I read another review that gave the book a 1 star rating and that reviewer had some good points to make: it IS badly edited, and did seem to lack depth. I enjoyed reading it, but felt there could have been more and that she just hit the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The misspellings and bad syntax errors are inexcusable given the price of this book. I would recommend borrowing it from someone."
3,good book,"The item arrived on time, but had more wear than I expected. It was packaged well. I would buy from this vender again. Interesting topic and read!"
2,OGG's latest,"The contributers on this recording did not take advantage of the talent. 'What it do' started to show promise, but failed the rest of the way. Not like the classic OGG we're used to."
1,almost ROCK HARD!!,"We bought this item for our Grandson's, ages 4 and 5.It is basically a standard hardness tetherball, with a thin rubberized coating.I blew it up to about 3 lbs of air pressure, and it IS HARD!There is no way this can be called a ""Soft"" Tetherball, and contrary to a previous reviewit would be very dangerous to allow very young children, especially boys, to bat bat this around apole, at each others faces."
1,Iron Fish Pan was ordered but never arrived,This order was never completed. We paid for it but up to now have not received the Cast-Iron Fish Pan.What gives anyway?John Wagner
2,Easy to use but blurry images,"The kids (9,6) enjoyed playing with the projector which was easy to use but the images it projects are not at all 3-D. The images are difficult to see with the 3-D glasses on and colorful yet blurry with them off. Overall it was used for about 40 minutes in two years. I'm sorry to say a complete waste of money although we have been happy with several other Uncle Milton products."
1,Waste of money,"I had a bad feeling this wasn't going to work when I saw the flimsy 3D glasses. Sure enough, I wasn't disappointed. Actually, I was. It was even worse than I thought as I couldn't see ANYTHING in 3D. My 7 yr old said he could but everyone else in the family just saw a blur. The whole experience is about as exciting as watching a film strip in 7th grade science class. I'm sure once I put it back in the box it won't see the light of day until we throw it away sometime next year."
2,Terrible,This is not 3D at all. Mine did not even come with the glasses.Really bad quality images. not worth the $20.
4,3D...not so much,"We were very excited to get this product. Small dissapointment with the 3D feature, its not really 3D at all. The last track on the CD is a little long. Other than that, we think this toy is very fun!"
4,GOOD PRODUCT,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 7 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT. SHE FALLS TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT WITH IT ON IN HER ROOM.
4,Outstanding paranotmal romance thriller,"The plot here while somewhat traditional is more twisted than the first book. Jackson is seeking out the witch that cursed his family hopping mtha by killing her he can break the curse. He finds a witch, Lucinda, just as she is in labor and in trouble. The plot thickens from there. Nicely done seduction sequences and nice characters and plot development. Resolution is not entirely traditional and over all well done. A little more humr than then the first book but not much. Very good read."
3,Didn't like this one as much as the first,But that's my only criticism. I like this series a lot so far.
4,Works well but is hard to clean.,"This is a satisfactory product. It keeps coffee hot and good tasting for at least an hour. Like many other automatic coffemaker carafes, it is difficult to clean because the top opening is so small. The channel in the lid through which coffee flows from the filter into the carafe can't be cleaned at all."
2,unclear,"the book had great songs in it and interesting commentary, however the way in which the music was written was confusing. i am reletivly new to guitar, so it may just be me, but the tablature numbers were mixed randomely through the musical staff, and i understood very little of it, even in its beginer section."
2,not what i was hoping for,"The book is pretty. For that, it get's 2 stars. BUT, 1/2 the book is duets. Part of the book is vocals. I don't have another guitar player to play with, nor a singer. So, 1/2 the book does me no good. So, I guess 2.5 stars god, 2.5 stars bad."
3,"Okay, but looking for something else","The music selections are well chosen, the print is easy to read, and the suggested fingerings are pretty good. Nonetheless, I'm looking for something else. The author makes a curious assertion that students are so reluctant to change their tuning down from g to f# or e to d, that he has avoided the requirement almost entirely. Well, that's standard practice when playing lute music on the guitar, and I actually like it, and it is in fact the norm among serious players. The only alternative, the one which this author has chosen, is alter the voicings even more than that already required for transposition, thereby getting you even further from the source material. Not a fan, and actually seriously doubt the reasoning behind this decision. There are a couple tunes here that are written for an alternate tuning, but honestly they all should be. Wasn't looking for a dumbed down version of Renaissance music, so I'm going to look elsewhere."
3,Comprehensive but annoying...,"Both my 2 and 5 yr old boys love this show and they took it off Discovery Kids when it became Hub. The shows on these DVDs are great, but the menus and navigation are horrible and there is no consistency in naming show and theme across seasons. All in all: a very sloppy, thrown together for Christmas, a little pricey for SD, but meets basic need to have Hi-5 running 24/7 box set.Good:comprehesiveness - all showskaraoke & sing along featuresquality of series in generalcatchy musicJenn is cute(ish)Bad:UsabilityPriceVideo quality (average SD)MenusNavigation (hard to tell what is highlighted)"
5,"FUN, FUN, FUN!! LEARNING","This show is very upbeat and exciting! It has constant fun learning segments! My little one has liked it from two to now four and I think will continue to enjoy it for years to come. They are almost like a musical and educational variety show.The members of the band sing songs and act out learning segments.I would HIGHLY Recommend to anyone with children from one to ten. Hi 5 shows are very ""clean and pure"" entertainment, no worries. OK for your children to watch them without guidance. (I like them too) haha"
1,Defective product AGAIN!,"Hi-5 is an absolutely amazing series, and my kids LOVE these videos.But this is the second time I have ordered this box set and had it be defective.The DVD's skip all over the place, it's is completely annoying and unacceptable.I bought this the first time thru Best Buy online and sent it back and got a refund.Now just bought it from Amazon, hoping the first one was just from a bad batch and if I bought thru a different supplier I could avoid that problem.Nope.I cannot tell you how frustrating this is and how poor quality the materials must be that they used for the DVDs.I am going to return this and try again, but I doubt the outcome will be different.Such a bummer, because as I mentioned, my kids are crazy about this series."
5,Love never ends,"My daughter fell in love with Hi-5 when she was one. At seven, she still loves it. We have several of the individual disks, but she'll be getting this complete set for Christmas! It's a great show, and not overly annoying like some. I catch myself singing the songs."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I loved this book. You'll feel like you were along for the ride and will be glad you weren't. He does a great job telling an exciting tale. There are some lousy ""adventure"" and ""lost at sea"" books out there. But this isn't one of those. This is a great book. I loaned it to a friend and never got it back...one of those! I loved it and highly recommend it."
1,Sooo Bad,"Because of the horrible writing style I couldn't get past twenty pages. It was so mercilously annoying to struggle through the author's short, choppy sentences. His story might have been intriguing, but he should have hired a professional ghost writer. Put it aside for 'Lost' which is a much better written book."
1,Can't get the darn thing to play!,I have tried playing this disc on every CD player in my house and car and can't get any sound out of it at all.I bought it for a person in the hospital because I knew already it was a great book to listen to. How can I get my money back?
2,repetitive and slow,"I'm a big a survivalist fan as any, but this story felt like it was just way too padded with fluff. I would guess a good third of the book consists of metaphysical musings, which become tiring when repeated every few pages. There's little room for the actual recount of the trip; this might be understandable given that there are only so many ways you can describe being on a raft for 76 days, but it just means that buyers interested in survival may want to reconsider picking this up. It's as much of a book on psychology and religion as on sailing or extreme situations.Avoid this book and pick up another instead."
5,Excellent,"This is a great book. I thought the author did a great job of putting you in his position. I just finished reading the story ""Two Survived"" which is a similar story about people trying to survive in a small boat with little or no survival / safety equipment. After reading that book it made me appreciate ""Adrift"" even more (Although I always thought Adrift was a 5 star book). Very good."
3,Decent book - bad e-book.,"Good:Book is 4-5 star, story is truly inspirational and survival adventure. It is exactly what I expected it to be.Bad:E-book quality is 1-2 star, some letters are missing and some are misspelled as they come out of some OCR scanner software. There are few drawings, but they are broken in ebook, caption is far from drawing. I miss map and photos which are (probably) part of the original hardcopy book."
5,I was SHOCKED by how great this book was,"I ordered this book on a whim. It's not usually my sort of fare but Callahan had me from the start and I had a hard time putting it down. Day by day, struggle by struggle, every new experience gave you either a sense of tremendous triumph or total despair. I was rooting for Callahan through out the book. I caught my self laughing out loud several times and twitching my feet nervously at others.Steven Callahan did one of the best jobs in all of adventure writing at bringing the reader into his little life-raft world. It was amazing to see an entire eco-system develop around his orange raft and how he interacted with it.Truly an amazing book and an amazing journey. Be forewarned, you'll feel lost at sea with Callahan!"
5,A Truly Scary Tale At Sea,"Steven Callahan is a blessed man. This true story is one of the most harrowing accounts of survival in a truly hopeless situation. He capsizes in minutes in the middle of the night with a raft and not much more. Nobody knows he's missing. No one is looking for him.Told with desperation and some much needed occasional humor, Callahan paints a story so real and frought with fear that you can read it in one sitting. It is difficult to imagine what one would do in a similiar situation and the very thought of it is spine tingling.This is a tale for every person who ever took to the water and every adventurer who feels safe in thier environment. You will never take the ocean for granted again after reading this book."
5,Man:1 Nature:0,"Steven Callahan's ""Adrift"" is an exciting and intellectually deep tale of one man's survival. When bad weather arises, a storm turns Steven's sailboat upside down. Watching his dreams go under, Steven readies himself and few supplies onto an inflatable life-raft, and prepares for a journey that will change his life forever. Fighting off dehydration, starvation, and even sharks, Callahan struggles to stay alive, and finds new meaning to what being ""alive"" really means. Seventy-six days pass, as well as many ships that miss him, before the author finds his place in nature, and ultimately, the key to survival. ""Amazing"" is an understatement to Callahan's writing. Whether you're a sailor, fisherman, or any other outdoorsman, this is the book for you!"
4,A classic ocean survival book,"Excellent ocean survival book. Steven Callahan's prior extensive sailing experience and ability to express potentially complicated concepts in rich but clear language make this an extremely easy yet gripping read. This book sheds light on the rollercoaster of the practical survival thought process required for survival, accompanied by deep philosophical reflections, and an understanding of man's place in the world. This work exudes genuine depth of spiritual learning."
2,"A bit boring, sorry!","It would have been a nicer book if it had 1/3 of the actual pages; it did bore me. Perhaps the way he writes does not do for me. Very interesting story though, and encouraging all the things he had to do in order to survive, never gave up."
4,Adrift: Seventy-six days lost at sea,Really interesting book. Opened my eyes to the harshness of survival and what people are capable of. A truly inspiring read.
3,Pretty good,I think the author made a sterling story of what must have mostly been boredom. Certainly good entertainment but I can't help wondering why as an experienced sailor he ventured into the Atlantic with what seems to have been a broken hull.
5,Gripping Tale of Survival,"Quite simply one of the best books I have read in years. Couldn't put it down kept falling asleep and waking to start reading until 2am, could not put it down.This book will inspire you to challenge your self in everyday life."
4,Very well done,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Perfect mix of reflection and action. Will be passing along to like minded reader.Good to see the author is doing well.
4,"timely shipping, excellent price",Always a dependable company for quick shipping and bargain prices. My first choice each time I buy used!
5,An excellent book.,"Adrift is the story of Steven Callahan who built and sailed ""Napoleon Solo"" across the Atlantic one and one half times. Attempting to sail in the `Mini Transat' race, Callahan's boat is sunk and he get out with little other than a safety raft and a small collection of supplies. Callahan survives for seventy six days alone to land in Guadeloupe with few injuries and in relative good health.There are few weaknesses to this book and you are left hoping selfishly that his journey had been over one hundred days so that you could read more. I was left amazed by Callahan's patience, intelligence, fortitude, and ability to adapt to his surroundings. This is a book where you hope you would do like the author did - but doubting your ability. Certainly the best book I have read in the genre."
3,lost at sea,I think Steven Callahan is an amazing person to have survived so long at sea.It was a good book but somehow I can't say I was totally gripped by it though I appreciate how difficult it must have been to fill a book with a subject matter like this.The thing I found most fascinating after his amazing survival was his interaction with the fish that surrounded him they became characters in book that otherwise would have only one - him. The relationship was necessary to him in both social and primal way. He needed their company and he needed to eat them. In a way I was a little disappointed that it wasn't explored further and I would have loved to hear his own take on the relationship in the aftermath of his rescue.
3,"Good Story, Average Book","As a story, Adrift was compelling and inspiring. As a book, it was much less so. The problem was that the book was almost a day-to-day account of one man's attempt to survive in a life raft in the middle of the ocean. One crisis after another...the crises were endless. How much of that can you read? And besides, there is little suspense because you know the author will survive -- otherwise he wouldn't be writing the book. So, you plod through page after page and then you start skimming paragraphs and then you start skipping pages. All you want to do is find out how he gets rescued and how did it affect his life. There is a fair amount of that and lessons to be learned, but they come at the end of the book. Getting to that point is tedious for the reader. I don't mean to minimize or trivialize what the author went through. The book was worth reading. But perhaps it could have been written differently, or more briefly."
4,A must for making a competitive Pinewood Derby Car!,This was one of the tools we credited for propeling us from near-bottom of the pack to winning our age group and fourth in our pack. The tool helped smooth out the rough edges of the wheels and decrease the friction between the wheels and the car body if used as directed. A must-have tool to create a winning Derby car.
1,Wish i could give a good review of 1.5,First and formost the item sent was not version 1.5 but 1.0 on cd.Not a problem go on line and download the latest version of 1.58.Then i find out that the program will not work with windows 7.So far i have not been able to use this program because i don't have windows xp.So please be advised that if you need or want to use this program make sure to have xp.Maybe one day the program will be updated to the 21st century and windows 7.Thanks
4,Good for the face,If you like you shaved with a broken beer bottle then buy this! The kit does great job reducing this issue.
1,Soap Pump,"This thing works OK - I bought it for dish soap in my kitchen. Unfortunately, the bottom of it rusts and leaves a nasty stain on my sink. I am buying a stainless steel one to replace it. Don't waste your money on this one unless you like looking at a rust stain."
5,Absolutely beautiful love story!!,"By Possesion is just a wonderful love story. You really feel the intense passion of Addis and Moira. I could not put this book down. Addis had such a difficult and challenging life and had been severely injured with scars both outside and inside. The ones on the outside would heal but it truly would take the steadfast love of Moira to heal the ones on the inside. Moira had loved Addis all her life - eventually when he realized that he would become whole again. And might just take that risk that their ""stations"" in life would not matter as much as living without each other. Like so many Hunter books this one just sizzles with the depth of the feelings this couple have for one another! GREAT GREAT BOOK!!"
2,By Possession,"I am astounded by the lack of proofreading in the Kindle edition of these books. It looks as if the publisher used a Beta Version of Omnipage, then sent it directly to Kindle without any proofreading whatsoever. Errors abound, leaving the book virtually unreadable!His becomes Bis, / stands in for I, but can also stand in for, "", three words become one, etc. I thought perhaps that might be the reason the books are somewhat less expensive through Kindle, but then, again, so are the ""perfect"" ones.I like Madeline Hunter's stories. I like her plots and (mostly),like her characters, though the female lead in ""By Arrangement"" seemed a little prone to getting herself into stupid scrapes. It is a shame that the e-publisher (whoever that might be) cannot publish a book without so many egregious errors."
2,Skip it.,"The two characters were likable enough, but the story was just too slow and boring. I didn't feel the heat that I like in a good romance novel. I just wanted it to be over."
1,Didn't live up to the exciting title!,"I'm afraid that I have to agree with the other one-star reviewer. I didn't enjoy this book, and I just couldn't finish it, despite my best efforts. The beginning was not bad at all...it had potential! The story was different and original. But then, I'm sorry to say, it became UNoriginal and too far-fetched for my liking,(I'm referring to a scene where the hero just happens to come across the heroine about to be gang raped in the woods). From that point the interactions between the hero and heroine became quite dull. They were supposedly in conflict, but actually they seemed to get along quite well and as they spent a lot of time in each other's company, it all became rather boring and pointless. I may be wrong. After all, I didn't finish the book. But, I suspect that this author is simply not to my taste. Different strokes for different folks!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"This book really made me think about its rating so I gave it 3 1/2 stars based on the story.On one hand the story was excellent but on the other hand it didn't really keep me that interested and I can't even explain why. It should have kept me engrossed.Don't get me wrong this was a very good book, however, I think it just wasn't my ""cup of tea."" It was too smooth; I didn't feel any emotions (hate, anger, love, etc.) while reading it. Sorry."
5,Hunter's Best,"I like Hunter's writing style and her ability to create unique charcters and make you feel that you are experiencing a differnet time period without getting too heavy handed with history lessons. I enjoyed the Protector and Lord of a Thousand Nights. By Arrangement was a bit slow-moving and low on action for me. By Possession is the hands down winner for me. A beautiful, gradually enfolding love story, with lots of sizzling passion. This is a true winner."
4,A VERY GOOD BOOK,"THIS IS THE STORY OF ADDIS de VALENCE AND MOIRA FALKNER. IT IS REFRESHING TO SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH ADDIS HAS BEEN BETRAYED ALOT, EVEN TAKEN AS A SLAVE AND HIS BODY SCARRED, THAT HE TRULY LOVES AND TRUSTS MOIRA. SHE IS HIS PEACE AND SALVATION. SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM FROM AFAR FOR MOST OF HER LIFE. AS HIS BONDWOMAN SHE KNOWS THAT SHE CAN NEVER TRULY HAVE HIM FOREVER, BUT ADDIS IS DETERMINED THAT SHE WILL BE HIS FOREVER, NO MATTER WHAT!!! THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK, BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE ENDING. I FELT THAT MOIRA REALLY FELT THAT IT WOULDN'T WORK BETWEEN THEM IN THE END ,BUT JUST COULD NOT WALK AWAY. FOR A VERY STRONG CHARACTER THROUGHOUT THE BOOK, I FELT LIKE SHE JUST WENT THROUGH THE MOTIONS SO TO SPEAK."
1,Better books available,"I ordered the book to get an overview of bus conversions and any nuances that converting one yourself has. This book has very basic info on the process. The section on raising the roof was probably the most informative of any of the chapters. Very poor illustrations (sketches) and picture quality. Half the book is filled up with pics of converted skoolies, most being hippy looking, half a%# jobs that would not be allowed in any campground. If you want a more informative book look for something by Dave Galey, although some of his are geared towards the touring buses, not skoolies. The concepts are the same and he has better details though."
5,Heavenly Music,"Hovhaness is a new discovery for me, and one that has opened up new vistas in music -- however his unique compositions may be defined. I first noticed his name in a catalog of a retrospective exhibit of the paintings of Boston expressionist artist Hyman Bloom. Being a fan of Bloom's, I decided to check out the music of his composer friend (who passed away several years ago)-- and did not regret it! As this wonderful CD eloquently shows, Hovhaness was a spiritually-inspired and innovative composer whose eclectic vision encompassed a range of unusual combinations of instruments guided by his resolute exploration of the inner world."
3,Useful but often whiny,"For learning about West Point, this DVD is most useful, mainly because it seems to be the only video series about the Military Academy. But the potential viewer should know it has flaws. The predominanting emphasis on women cadets is inappropriate. The amount of time given to rants and whining by cadets is excessive--yeah, we know it's tough, but how many times do we have to hear the same complaints? In one case, I was actually hoping that one young lady would quit her griping and just quit. Good points include the interviews with graduates, especially recent ones who have gone into dangerous situations, where the West Point experience pays off. This is a good series that probably is worth your time."
3,Not really an accurate representation,"I attended West Point and although the documentary is not showing incorrect information, it is showing an overly positive version of the experience."
5,A must see classic!,"simple message in this classic is priceless.Beautiful scenery and great humor, a comedy for all ages!"
5,One of my all time favorites,"This is a great movie! Not only is it brilliantly funny, but I can watch it with my kids and not have to ask them to leave the room or explain anything to them. I really cannot understand why we can't buy a new copy of either VHS or DVD, but when I can I will!"
5,Funny,"I love this movie. My parents do too even though they don't understand much English. The action and his strange behavior make up for the language barrier. I also brought the second movie too. That one was great too, but it was more about his kids in the second movie but still funny."
5,EXCELLENT,"LOVED BOTH ""GODS MUST BE CRAZY"" FILMS - SAW THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WILL SEE THEM AGAIN. THIS IS A MUST SEE!!"
4,The God's must be crazy,I had seen this movie years ago and loved it.I watched it again a week ago I still love it and will watch again.It is really funny and entertaining.It is worth buying.
4,Hilarious & Touching,"The Gods Must Be Crazy is one of the funniest movies of all time. It is so utterly unlike other movies: for one thing, it takes humor to the African bush, but this isn't slap-stick fare. It's a story of perseverance and dedication on a journey to the end of the world -- along with all the strange and funny things that happen in everyday life. In Africa.This is definitely a must-see for everyone, any age, any time."
4,Comedic Anthropology,"Jamie Uys' low budget comedy exploring the possible situations when a civilization's trash becomes a primitive tribe's divine object.N!Xau is a Kalahari bushman who suddenly comes upon a coke bottle dropped from an airplane. A simple tribesman, N!Xau sees the bottle as a divine gift and is happy to be the recipient. Unfortunately, N!Xau has no idea what the bottle is for or what the gods mean by it. A creative man, he begins to put the bottle to use but it soon becomes an item others in his tribe covet. How will they end up using their new holy object?This is a witty little film on cultural and social clashes. It uses a simple situation with humor to touch upon important anthropological and sociological issues on religion, technology, and individual/collective rationalization. A great film to watch."
1,A Very Racist Movie,"This is a very racist movie. When I was in a college, one of my teachers played a documentary and N!xau was saying how he regrets making this movie because it is derogatory to Africans. I wish I could remember the title of the documentary so you can watch it. Anyway, I don't recommend this movie to anyone."
5,One of my Top Ten movies.,One of the best movies I have ever seen.I decided to buy this before some reason it became unavailable especially as it's getting hard to find in video stores. It looks as if I'm too late.
4,Namibian classic,"The movie was a hoot years ago but took on special meaning this year when we safaried in Namibia, Africa!! Here are the plants, trails, and the bush!!!"
4,Still charming!,"I saw this film when it was first released, alone, late one night in NYC. I dragged my family back into the theatre the next night - age range from 10 to 80 and they all loved it! Haven't seen it since until last night and I was afraid it might be way too dated for my 6 year old grand daughter. The charm was still there! She laughed at all the right parts, asked a ton of questions and my only regret was that I didn't wait another year or two. (I totally forgot about the rebel gunman holding school children hostage during the last half hour and she just started first grade this week!) Nevertheless, she asked to see the movie again sometime soon. Dated yes, but still sweet, innocent, funny and unique. (Wait till they're 8 for the relatively mild violence factor.)"
4,Things go better with Coke,"An African tribesman finds an empty glass Coke bottle and believes it to be a special item given by the Gods. He takes the bottle to his tribe and they use if for all sorts of tasks around the village. When jealousy over the use of it leads to fighting, the tribesman goes on a sojourn to return it to the Gods. He encounters all sorts on his journey, including an English couple. If some of this doesn't crack you up, I will be very surprised. I recommend it."
5,The Gods Must Be Crazy,"One of the highest grossing foreign films ever released in the U.S., Uys's endearing satire of modern life and consumption is a mix of slapstick gags, cross-cultural confusion, and hoot-inducing desert humor. The film's star, N!xau, is not an actor, but an aboriginal who, like his character, was completely unacquainted with Western culture before the movie was made. Yet it's the white urban dwellers and war-mad revolutionaries who come off looking like the biggest buffoons--and who earn the most derisive laughs. If you don't find yourself bent over double watching this one-of-a-kind madcap adventure, then it's not just the gods who must be crazy. Suitable for older children."
2,Has not weathered well,"I really enjoyed this movie when it was first released. Recently rented it to share with my kids and we could not even make it through the first 30 minutes. There are wonderful messages conveyed, and it definitely strives to be slapstick, but oy, it's a painful journey trying to rewatch it some 25 years later!"
5,Gods of their Genre,"Starkweather excell at their genre heck they practially started it. They have infullenced almost every hardcore/metal band. There would be no Converge, Poison the Well etc. if these guys(and a girl) hadn't released this extremely influential record.Amazing lyrics part screamed part sung.Heavier than anything you've heard. yeah just get it."
5,Wonderful Book,A classic go-to for quick kid knitting. Will be a favorite of mine for years to come. I highly recommend it.
2,definitely not for beginners,"My main complaint about this book is that there are no graphics/schematics/charts to show the beginner what the individual pieces should look like, and some of the pieces are quite complex in shape, e.g. the top piece of the sheep. Woe to the beginner who encounters an error but is inexperienced and thus doesn't recognize it - I predict lots of frogging! I'm far from being a beginner, but I've had to frog twice on one toy!My other complaint is the weird notation, e.g. ""Inc 1 st in next and 3 foll 3rd row."" HUH?? For goodness sake, just say, ""Inc 1 st in next row. Knit 2 rows straight. Inc 1 st in next 3 rows.""Take a pass on this book and buy instead World of Knitted Toys by Kath Dalmeny."
3,Cute designs for people with sewing/finishing experience,"I'm a relatively new knitter and I bought this book thinking I could make a toy for my nephew. The toys are very cute and come in a variety of easier and more complex styles.I had no problem with the knitting (except there were one or two minor errors in the pattern I tried).Making up the toy was harder for me. People with experience with sewing or with finishing knitted projects could probably put together toys quickly and easily, but I had some difficulties. There are no diagrams showing how the pieces fit together, so I had to figure it out by trial and error from written instructions, and it was harder than I expected.Also there are no instructions on how to seam the toys to produce the tidy edge shown in the photos. I was able to find such instructions instructions in other knitting books, but it would have been nice for them to be included here."
3,Toy Knits,There is a selection of different animals to knit in this book. Some could have been made nicer by knitting tighter as the stuffing shows a lot on quite a few projects. Not as professional looking toys as I thought I'd see from Debbie Bliss but none-the-less there is a good selection.
1,"Not really for experienced knitters, either","Admittedly, I only attempted one of the projects in this book - the sailor doll. I am an experienced knitter, but despite my best efforts, this project was a disaster. I certainly do not plan to attempt another one from this book. The first problem I had was that I had ordered the yarn in accordance with the directions given - weight and amounts, and of the two main colors required for this project, the amounts were totally wrong. The piece required twice as much of one of the colors and four times as much of the other as was stated. This caused quite a bit of inconvenience and additional expense, and, of course, the re-order was not from the same dye lot. I agree with one of the other reviewers that eventually you can get used to the way Ms. Bliss phrases things, but the instructions are annoyingly vague - if you are not also an experienced seamstress, and even if you are, you might have difficulty following the directions for this project."
1,ZZZ,"this movie is ok to fall asleep to. but the seem like like people, arrr six more words required, word."
4,Great Doc!,"This is a great documentary. It moves along at a very nice pace, it covers a broad range of people and issues but it always feels centered and focused. The research is impressive, especially into the LSD testing of the time period, and you realize how much of an impact BOTH Huxley's work had on the counter-culture. A nice foray into a part of literary history I did not know much about."
5,Aldous & Laura Huxley's story,They were my inspiration in my younger days. What a pleasure to see this and hear Laua once again. A great nostalgic review.
5,Fantasysoundtrack,"I have Choosen and this Soundtrack because,the People likes to now how it is.I like this soundtrack very much.There is noting to recomment on this Product.Many RegardsR.Cavallaro"
4,Enjoyable Soundtrack By Randy Newman,"I got the Bug's Life CD a while ago and still like listening to it. It has a catchy song, and several nice jazzy pieces. My favorite tracks are 2, 8, and 14. I hope you can enjoy this too!"
4,Says Law and the Keynesian Revolution,"""Says Law and the Keynesian Revolution"" offers an excellent explanation of Say's Law, the central principle of market economics, and its relevance, though perhaps with gratuitous exploration of previous interpretations."
2,Disappointing.,"I love a good gothic and am always looking for new ones. Unfortunately, this wasn't it. While I liked the character of ""Vinney,"" she was oblivious to the most obvious clue that I, as the reader, pickup up almost immediately. There was very little development of the ""hero,"" and absolutely none of the ""villain."" I never really felt involved and so was unaffected by what little suspense there was. The climax was too abrupt and the very end, just plain silly. Guess I'll have to re-read Victoria Holt and Mary Stuart."
3,One of Everything,"Henderson covers all the bases, and the book is full of helpful hints. But book is a synopsis of all he's read (not complete) and is presented in a dry style. Though solid at core, information is now dated. Good for brief history of single-handing, and lots of helpful hints and illustrations. Well worth the purchace, well worth the read, but keep reading. Does anyone know what boat is on the cover?"
2,For the uninitiated.,I read this book about halfway to Hawaii from SF. Enjoyed the history of single handing but found the rest of the book a bit dated and advice a bit mundane. I'm not a novice single hander so might be a matter of already knowing most of what was in the book.
4,A nice overview of the most popular execution methods,"Anyone interested in issues regarding capital punishment should get a hold of this book. Drimmer covers the history of the most popluar methods of executions in america: hanging, electrocution, lethal gas, firing squad, and lethal injection. Drimmer does a very good job of staying unbiased throughout the book - you never really get a sense of his opinion regarding this macabre subject. The book does drag at some points with anecdote after anecdote of specific cases. I also wish he had gone more in depth to some of the colonial methods of execution and torture. But this is a good resource for students and enthusiasts alike. Pick it up if you can find it."
4,Some of the best by Waylon and Willie (and more!),"This CD just about covers it for the likes of Waylon and Willie. Of course Tompaul Glaser adds a nice flair but catch him on his own recordings too! The opening cut ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,"" is a nice slow tribute to the Old West but the one that really gets this CD rocking is ""Good Hearted Woman."" This tune should only be enjoyed by the true country music lovers--the ones that don't believe in today's ""new"" country artists. ""Me and Paul"" is a sad commentary on Willie's life on the road--for reasons that I'd rather not disclose. On a final note, one does not need to be an Elvis fan to admire Waylon and Willie's version of ""Suspicious Minds""--try it--I can almost guarantee you'll like it!"
4,great listen,"classic album.outlaw music at its finest.1996 reissue enhances album.BY THE WAY JESSI COLTER MUST HAVE BEEN LISTNING TO YOU PEOPLE ON HERE,SHE HAS AN AWESOME NEW GREATEST HITS ALBUM.ORDER IT RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON.COM. NO PLUG INTENDED."
3,The memories are better than the music,"I grew up on country music, with Waylon & Willie being among the most ""modern"" singers that my family listened to. At the time, I loved this album. I especially loved Jessie Colter. ""I'm Not Lisa"" still brings back memories. ""Suspicious Minds"" is really kind of schmaltzy and cliched, but I liked it then and I still like it.All these years later, I'm not sure I really needed a reissue with ""lost"" music, though. Truth be told, I don't find most of this music as compelling as I did back in my youth. Waylon & Willie both did much better work elsewhere. Tompall Glaser is forgettable, in my view. I still love Jessie Colter, though. I just wouldn't necessarily recommend her to others. Her voice is definitely an acquired taste. I loved the fact that one of The Outlaws was a woman, I guess. Some things never change."
3,Where is JESSIE?????,Ok folks I can sooo agree with the review about Jessie. Whrere is SHE and why can't I buy her albums? I have one of my mothers but its vinyl and sorta scratched come on guys ltes get some JESSIE !!!!!!For anyone who has not really heard her she is amazing and yes I remember You did hang the moon didn't you Waylon? and I love love LOVE I thought I heard you calling my name.
3,Been listening to this since 1980,"I have the vinyl and now own the CD. A mostly great collection of tunes that opened up country/western music for a whole lot of us who didn't particularly even like country before. This is a compilation of tunes from Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Tom Paul Glasser, and Jessi Coulter in an older country style. No ""rockabilly"" Gretchen Wilson sound here. The ""new"" material are some added songs by Jessi, which in my opinion do zero to enhance this CD. ""Put Another Log on the Fire,"" a satirical look at relationships by Tom Paul is my absolute favorite -- we used to sing this in college and laugh ourselves silly. I still love to sing it. ""Me and Paul"" is an example of a good, wry Willie song (for more of this type of song check out his ""Poncho and Lefty"" album). I like all of Waylon's more rock-ish type songs. The big drawback to this CD? Sorry folks, I just can't stand Jessi's twangy voice. Dump her and the CD would be worth 4 and a half stars."
3,you get what you pay for,"Ordered 3 CD's this one is damaged, first cut skips, It was used so I guess you get what you pay for. I will not deal with seller again."
4,Yea Country!,"Can you ever really go wrong w good country music? I believe not. Good tunes and I feel like wearing boots & a hat, damn it!"
3,Her most fragmented product,"Quite fragmented repertoire and production wise,OLHO D'AGUA remains one of Bethania's least popular productions.However,the inspirational ILUMINA and the candombleish RAINHA NEGRA and LOUVAAO A OXUM make it worth listening to.On the other hand,the single ALEM DA ULTIMA ESTRELA sounds lifeless among drekky arrangements."
4,"Great music,but bad qualityDVD!","I was trying to find something from Bill Bruford,and I found it with this,but what a bad quality DVD,very poor video and sound.I gave 4stars in the raiting just for the music."
3,Do NOT Buy This Game!,"I have every TW for xbox from 2003,'07 is a rip-off,plain and simple.The two-stick controller(Alternate swing)is a joke,as well as the ball position feature.The team mode is just EA's way of reaching for something new.If you want a real simulation,not arcade try Prostroke Golf 2007 World tour-The two-stick swing in Prostroke is truly realistic and unforgiving.It may not have the graphics and deep gameplay(Gameface,other options)Of TW '07,but it's only the first effort from Gusto Games.Bottom line:If you want re-hashed leftovers,TW '07 is the game for you.If you want a true experience of what a golf swing looks and feels like,Prostroke Golf is your game."
3,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 for Xbox,"The program is nice and graphics are good except the golf ball is too big. The extensive ability to customize your player is a bit long and over done. The game play is easy and the putting is way too easy, you almost have to try to miss to screw up a put. I rate this program *** out of 5 for that reason. I have another golf program called Links for the Xbox that I like better. It plays much more like real golf and is much more of a challenge so I rate it **** and believe me putting with that program takes some skill. Others have rated Tiger Woods programs with disappointment because they say there aren't that much difference between some of them but since this is the only version I have, I can't respond to that comment and can't down rate the program for that. All in all, it's a good game if you don't have Links to compare it to."
4,"Little bit better, Not the same ol' same ol'",The last in the series for the original Xbox it is definitely more refined. The new game modes are inventive and extremely fun. The team aspect is a great way to deliver fresh game play every time. I wonder if any of the ladies in the game are personal friends of TW?
3,NOT IMPRESSED,"I was a huge fan of the 2005 edition. The 2007 is nearly the same thing only it doesn't play as smoothly as the 2005 edition. All of the phrases are the exact same as the 2005 edition. Overall, it is still entertaining but is not in any way original."
4,Nicely written. Binding needs improvement...,A well written and illustrated book at a very reasonable price. The author writes about Michelangelo from an intellectually liberated point of view. A welcome change indeed. I would give the book five stars if the book binding were better.If you don't handle very carefully the pages may fall out. Still a good buy!
5,Understanding Spiritual Greatness,"This book is very enlightening. There are many powerful men and women who have gone before George Whitefield. I am delighted to find this book on Amazon,com John pollock has given us a greater understanding of what prayer cando for our nation. Hunger for God, can be understood by reading George Whitefields Life."
3,It's Been Done Before,"This CD is just a repeat of the various Phyllis compilations that concentrates on her stint with Buddah/Arista. The only exception is the inclusion of a previously unreleased gem called ""Sounds Like A Love Song"". Other than that, you should invest your money into a more comprehensive set, preferably one that concentrates more on her Philly/Zoo years."
4,A good collection of her early works.,"Focusing primarily on Phyllis' 1976-78 recordings for the Buddah and Arista labels this 11-track CD serves as a fine introduction to her early works and the songs which established her as one of the best Soul and Jazz songstresses of our time. With the sole exception of the previously-unissued ""Sounds Like A Love Song"", however, this collection offers nothing new. While I enjoy this CD greatly I must also say that the ""Legacy of Phyllis Hyman"" 2-CD set is a much better and truly definitive anthology of the late and much-missed Ms. Hyman's works."
2,One of the most ridicious Superman sagas ever.,It makes no sense that Superman should be transformed into two energy beings and have powers that we have never seen before. I think this was a bad marketing attempt on DC's part to attarct a larger reading audience but long time Superman readers avoided it. I've often said that DC has done nothing but destroyed everything once great about it's universe and Superman is sadly an example of that.
1,A definite low point in the Superman saga,"This was deadend story by a creative team that had run out of ideas after the ""Death of Superman Story"". The costume is ugly and the premise is weak. All they really accomplish is make Superman whine alot about not understanding his new powers. And don't expect any explanation about how the ""transformation"" occurred. I doubt that Jurgens and the rest of the creative team ever figure that one out themselves."
3,Good but confusing,"The overall story is good. Superman has to fight lots of different charactes along trying to cope with his new powers. In the begining he doesn't even have powers! I will say however that unless you've read the story ""The final night"" then this story won't make much sence at the start because there are LOTS of refferences to it."
4,"Response to ""Unity Lunacy""","While I haven't read this particular work by Charles Fillmore, I am quite familiar with his works and Unity principles. While certainly Unity is not conventional, nor fundamentalist, one would be hard-pressed to define it as a cult. These principles are grounded in the basic teacings of Jesus, certainly not snake oil! Simply put, Unity basically asserts that God is all and we are all somehow a part of God as we are created in God's image and likeness. The Fillmore's discovered the healing power of God in their lives and gradually sought to pass this knowledge on. They never did assert that they stumbled onto anything new, and they always affirmed Jesus as teacher and as divine-nothing cult-like here unless one defines all of Christianity to be a cult! I highly recommend Charles Fillmore's writings as well as those of his wife's, Mrtyle Fillmore."
4,A great book about C++ Pocket PC Game Programming,This is an easy read and it contains valuable game programming source code. This book makes getting into C++ game programming on the Pocket PC much easier than you would have imagined. The emBedded C++ version 3.0 is a little dated but the same code easily transfers to the new emBedded C++ Version 4!
3,gaia and fear don't match,"I am really mad at Gaia for what she did in this book. I'm sorry, but she doesn't realize fear will not make her normal. My friend and I are still fumeing from reading this book. But if you are planning on reading the book, still read it, I am just saying that you won't like the ending."
3,Yet Another Addition To The Fearless Series,"The book was written with no less quality than all of Francine Pascal's other books in this particular series. I found, however, that she continues to torture Gaia with the situations she is given. There are a lot of things that are happening in the book, and i'd address them, but i wouldn't want to give it away.I was not happy with the way the book ended, but for those of you who are as intrigued by the series as I am, it's a must-read.There have been 2 times during the series in which I was ready to write to Francine and tell her to lay off the drama, and this was another one of those times, however I think that with the addition of these plots, the series is only going to get better and better."
4,Different than usual,"I have been enjoying this series for a long time and I also enjoyed this book, so much so that I read it in four hours. In this book Gaia has to make alot of choices about things she has been living with for awhile. We also see Oliver's nature start to change, but not for the better. At the end something bad ends up happening and we are left waiting for the next one. If you enjoy Samurai Girl there is an excerpt for that at the back of Normal."
4,John Candy,All three movies are funny. John Candy is hillarious. Spaceballs is a twisted startrek/starwar thing. Delerious is...well delerious. and Canadian Bacon is about a mountiee.
3,Canadian Bacon,I purchased this DVD solely for Canadian Bacon. The U.S. hawks are anxious to have another war and they pick Canada as the target. Nobody gets killed. Aspects of Canadian life are humorously ridiculed and the late Canadian actor John Candy plays the part of a redneck American.
5,Roam & The Collective box set,"Product arrived very quickly, and in the condition described. Both movies are top notch Downhill/Freeride MTB movies, a must have for anyone interested in Mountain biking."
4,Managers Notebooks,"I ordered these notebooks for my manager, to be used as journals. He is very pleased with them."
2,Wrong Title,"This should've been called ""The bad things that happened to me while pet sittng for 8 years."" The vast bulk of the book is made up of anectdotes from the author's life that, taken alone, would keep anyone from wanting to become a pet sitter. Although the author obviously has a love of her job, there is not one recount of a positive experience that would explain that love. The reader has to pause in wonder at the author's fear of mice, squirrels, iguanas, and even some cats. If you're a lover of ALL animals, or you if you're looking for advice on how to start or improve your business, you'll find this book seriously lacking in substance. Written in second (yes, second) person, and full of uninspired language wrapped around poor attempts at humor(ie.repeated use of the phrase 'no pun intended'), this is a disappointment by any measure. Two stars is a generous rating."
5,Guidelines for the Pet Sitter Professional,"As owner of Arizona Canine Academy, a school that trains trainers, we are asked about the Pet Sitting Profession. Suzanne's book is the perfect guide for those wishing to enter and be successful in this profession. This book has been added to the required reading list for all of our students. Great book and great information."
2,A bit petty,"This book is full of cute stories and mishaps, but honestly a lot of the mishaps that the author had were just plain silly mistakes on her part. For example, there is a ""chapter"" (about 2 paragraphs really) called, ""The Face of Fear"". I'm thinking ""Wow, what happened?"" Turns out that when she gets to a house to care for a pet, she has a bit of a panic attack in the car over whether or not she has the house keys with her. Um...I'd be checking that sort of thing BEFORE you leave your house. Or a couple of times when she had trouble with the client's house alarm system. Again, something I'd be sure I had under control, BEFORE they left town. So, yea, there are some cute stories and some stories that I wouldn't admit to if I were her."
3,The reality of professional pet sitting,"This is a cute, informative book if you are trying to decide if you want to look into the business of pet sitting as an occupation. However, this is not a helpful guide if you are looking for advice on how to start one. It is a comical fast read and I am afraid to say I felt it was not worth the amount of money I paid for it. The book is the size of one of my children's easy read books and does not contain enough information to warrent the price when comparing it to other books on this subject."
3,Xzibit's First Album/3.5 Stars,"Not at all as good as Xzibit's other albums, though still some nice songs. Paparazzi, the Foundation, and Hit & Run Pt. II are nice songs, but there was alot of songs I didn't like. If you want Xzibit's best, then pick up ""40 Dayz & 40 Nights"" You should wait to buy this after you have the rest of Xzibit's albums."
3,"Good, if inconsistent, debut","Xzibit splashed onto the scene with ""Paparazzi""... but we can forgive him for that. Even though the orchestration of the song was excellent, it was an obvious plea for radio attention. In spite of that, the rest of ""At the Speed of Life"" doesn't cater to the radio, and is a good record despite being inconsistent in that goodness. The highlights include the bumping banger-with-a-message, ""The Foundation,"" the bouncy ""Positively Negative"" with King Tee (that bassline is DEEEEEP), ""Hit & Run, Pt. II,"" which uses one of my favorite beats of all time, and ""Plastic Surgery,"" a hilarious metaphor of a song where Xzibit, Saafir and Ras Kass are the doctors. Unfortunately, there are several moments where the album falls on its face, suffering from bland production, but the highlights make it an album worth purchasing."
5,I really liked it,"I saw this movie ten years ago at the Seattle International Film Festival and I've been looking for it since then! At the time I didn't know of Hugh Grant, but the actresses affected me strongly. I don't know how 'accurate' the movie was, but the positive impression it made on me lasted all these years."
3,Games don't recreate the full feel of real LSAT problems,"There are approximately 44 original games in the book.Like a lot of 3rd party books on LSAT logic games, this book doesn't use real LSAT games and instead the authors have written their own. I don't have a problem with this, but I find these made-up games often don't do a good job at recreating the true feel of an LSAT game.I found the categorization of the games a bit odd, but I bought the book more for the extra problems so how they categorized the game isn't really that important.The book is ok if you've exhausted the supply of official LSAT problems and are looking for more games to do. It's not great as a teaching tool, but sufficient as a source of extra practice.I found the games to be neither overly easy nor overly difficult. They're just about right. Hard enough to stretch you and teach you how to work through the problems faster, which is what a lot of people have trouble with, timing."
3,"Good, but too general","I bought this book looking for a detailed method for solving the riddle that are LSAT logic games. Instead, I found a book that can tell me how to identify the types of games, but leaves me without straightforward methods for solving the problems. A better strategy would be to simply do as many of the offical LSAT problems as you can before you take the test.However, it is helpful to have quite a few examples of ""solved"" problems with explanation. With the official test book, you know that you got the answer wrong, but don't know why.So, if you have the money to spend recklessly, this book will get you further toward your goal of understanding how logic games work, but it may not help you do much better on them without practice, practice, practice."
3,Carmageddon II Carpocalypse Now : Carpocalypse Now,"This is a very good book, because it has very good explanations, and also it has a lot of images and illustrations, and you can understand it better, you can play better because with this book you know how to play, and they tell you tips so you can play better."
2,I bought it for a kid...but,"Kids have fun with it, but only for a few moments. the darts don't stick and bounces off really easily.but it is a safe product for children."
1,Don't buy from this vendor,"1. Sent me the wrong battery for my phone (ordered 1 standard, 1 extended life; got two standard).2. Sent me a cheap, defective USB data cable. It was the correct one, but the release button was jammed stuck, and it broke when trying to remove the cable, potentially damaging my phone.3. Sent the wrong replacement USB cable.4. Didn't have an extended life battery in stock to send me."
3,McMahon sure can belabor a point!,"'Happiness: A History"" spends 560 pages to make the point that personal happiness, as we define it today, is a relatively new concept. Throughout most of history, the emphasis has been on leading a ""good"" or ""virtuous"" life, as defined by one's impact on society. This is a point worth making, but McMahon makes it over, and over, and over again. I really don't know who this book is intended for; it reads like some extra-long PhD thesis. It contains a lot of useful (or semi-useful) reference material, but I can't imagine anyone reading it all the way through in its entirety."
5,Echo of Paul Johnson,"This is a terrific book, and an amusing, provocative, and delightfully lilting read. McMahon echoes the suggestion of Paul Johnson that Enlightenment rationalism's undermining of religioous faith left a vacuum that has been filled by worship of artists and intellectuals who, we are to imagine, feel deeply, and both suffer and exult so much more transcendently than we Muggles. While the first two-thirds of the book are a treat themselves, it is the final third that bears the book's importance. It is here where McMahon exposes the many hollow spaces that we delude ourselves to be the residences of ""happiness."""
1,"extremely dispointed - cereal box product, extremely overpriced",this $95 phone with the annoying ring is available from Target for 49.99. even at that price it's not worth it.
2,Not great,"I really really liked the look of this phone. After two months, though, the phone's ringer stopped working consistently. Sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't. Most of the time, to get it to ring, it has to be on the actual cradle -- not real helpful for a cordless phone!"
5,An Astonishing Story,"This is a story of astonishing courage, resilience, resourcefulness and dignity in the face of the overwhelming resources of the totalitarian Soviet mammoth. The story is told plainly and simply, almost matter-of-factly about a struggle against all odds, a struggle to prevent Ukraine's being drowned in the poisons of Sovietism. Perhaps most striking is the calm dignity with which the author and her colleagues in the Ukrainian underground faced death almost daily, and their quiet determination to continue their mission, well into the 1950's, to fight for some semblance of normalcy in Ukraine no matter what the personal and familial costs to the author and those with whom she served so nobly. This is a stunner."
4,A book about UPA heroine,"Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, had a glorious history and at one time was the capital of ancient Rus'. Yet the Ukraine gained independence only upon the collapse of the Soviet Union. Oppressed by both Poland and Russia/Soviet Union, many Ukrainians felt resentful and hostile towards both Poles and Russians. During World War II, the Soviet Union and Poland fought on the allied side, so an enemy of the Soviet Union, such as the UPA, became an enemy of the West. While the Ukrainians fought heroically both for the Soviet Union and against, they obviously had no monopoly on heroism. There is also some reliable evidence of the UPA members killing innocent Polish and Jewish civilians. Unfortunately, some Poles retaliated against the UPA atrocities in a revengeful manner. This is an important book, which should be read by all those interested in the war on the Eastern Front during World War II."
5,Take note: a coming-of-age classic,"The Full Cleveland is all that it promises to be and more. At firstread, it is a charming and funny coming-of-age tale that follows theParkman family's precipitous slide from the enchanted wealth ofShaker Heights, Ohio into the middle class normalcy of ""It's aWonderful Life."" Seen through Boyce Parkman's original mind, however,as she moves from childhood to young adulthood, this multi-layeredcomic and lyrical journey becomes a classic, raising moral andphilosophical questions along the way. Boyce's wry, subversive voicelures us, laughing one moment and crying the next, into inquiries aboutconscience, love, beauty, knowledge, and courage. In the end, The FullCleveland becomes a family primer on how to live."
1,Not a good seller,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my father in law, it stated that it was new. It was clearly a used book as it looked worn and had someone's name printed on the inside cover and then was whited out. Needless to say, I was very disappointed and could not give it to someone as a gift."
4,Mr. Plow,"Doesn't scratch the blacktop. Going on year 3 of plowing with this wear bar. Nice and quiet. Will buy another when time comes, very happy with this product. The pre-drilled mounting holes on this WARN bar did not match up with the with the factory mounting holes on my Polaris plow. I drilled my own holes without issue."
1,DON'T EVEN BOTHER!!,"I don't know how else to put it... this brand totally SUCKS! I purchased 3 so i can have two other friends come over and help me bake cookies for a bake sale. The scooper arm came dislodged after the first scoop. I fixed it then it did it again. I don't think I got one decent scoop out of it. After the third try, I gave up. I was using it for nothing but the most basic sugar cookie dough. Can you imagine the hassle if I was making something more chunky? *ugh!* like i said... DON'T EVEN BOTHER!"
3,To small for cookies,This scoop is great quality but too small for a cookie dough scoop unless you are making mini cookies. Works great as a fresh fruit scoop.
3,One of a few books providing a detailed Korean history,"While I found the writing a bit pedantic and cumbersome, to a large degree, I have not found this information anywhere else in the English language. The author pulls together scholarly materials from a wide variety of sources to attempt a current understanding of the history of the Korean penninsula. I appreciated the author's effort and scholarship. I would have appreciated the history more if written in a style that involved the reader (think Stegner's ""Beyond the Hundredth Meridian"" or DeVoto's ""1846"")."
2,This book is too detailed,"This book is very difficult to read because it is not well-written and also because there are too many details. Furthermore, the author introduces so many characters in each chapter but never talks about them again later in the book. So it is difficult to determine who is important and who is not important.I find it impossible to believe that one reviewer found this book ""neither too skimpy nor too detailed."" How else do I know that this book is truly too detailed and inaccessible for most readers? One of the translators, Edward Wagner, concedes in another book (""Korea: Old and New"") that this book was, in fact, too detailed."
2,Agreed,"Agreed, runtime is about 40 minutes and Grandmaster Park goes over some basic counters to a couple common attacks from each style. You may get some drill ideas from the material presented here for training against each of the styles, which is good, but I'd say it's probably not worth the price. Too short and too basic with not enough dynamic energy in the video. One other thing that could have made this video better is subtitles as Grandmaster Park is sometimes difficult to understand. The DVD also promises much in terms of each styles weakness, Taekwon-Do's strengths, etc. but it fails to deliver anything extraordinary. Depending on your instructor and training background, you may pick up one or two things."
5,Insanely Great must be added to your disciple collection,"I just recently found this CD and I have been a Disciple fan for a long time and all their stuff has been great, with very awesome messages in their songs. My kids even like them a lot, but I have to say this is by far their best work to date that I have heard, this is a must have CD for anyone no matter what your taste in music is. I downloaded this over the weekend and I can't stop listening to it, I wish I would have found it before now. My thanks go out to the band hats off to them on this one."
1,bANDAI gUNDAM SEED dvd #3 REVIEW,"THE PRODUCTION OF BANDAI STINKS! The item in question is bad. it dose not go to the next episode. instead it replays parts of the episode I just watched then replays the ending theme and the next epsiode trailer. its like wathing the same epsiode twice in order to get to the next epsoide. I sent a message to Bandai USA regudarding the mater. Due to Full cost and no customer support at all. the money on Bandai Licned product hads gone to the balck market. To Bandai., I had so many bad dvds on bad production. Bandai please sell your business to some one else or close shop.do not waste time and money on delaers and customer's money any more . Shame on you Bandai - USA for your bad products and worst customer support.I send so many DVDs to bandai and they lied it works. when it dose not work. I am disgusted with the service of Bandai. just as bad as Hewett Packard. making and sellling dead products for a livingwasting dealers and customrers time and money."
5,Tuscan Vine 10-3/4 inch Dinner Plate,This is an excellent product. Not the usual Corelle type plate. The plates are heavy and feel like very expensive dinnerware. I like the lovely printed design...very nice!
2,"No feeling for place, no feeling for people","I grabbed this book because it is so hard to find books about West Africa, and because it appeared to be so well reviewed. But I hated it! The wildlife aspects didn't captivate me; but the writer's whole attitude to the people he met alternately shocked and dismayed me. He talks of people's villages ""littering"" the landscape; refers to languages as ""dialects"" without seeming ever to recognise the incredible complexity of the culture in Senegambia; patronises the people he meets; never bothers to learn the correct names for things (""tom-toms"" is not really a term used for African drummers) ... refers to how he likes his African musicians ""wild"" and gets dismayed when they instead start wearing ""modish trousers"" in Paris ... His driver buys a charm to hang from his window but discards it, jealous of his compatriot's ""shiny"" souvenirs ... He treats people like children and the descriptions of wildlife fail to grip. A very very great disappointment."
3,Cute little Movie,It was a cute movie. It's a little slow at certain points. Iit reminded me of a Judy Blume book in live action.
5,Very good family movie,"This is one of those movies that is great for the whole family, young to old. It has enough fresh comedy to keep you laughing, and the proper drama to grip you and feel the emotion that the writers intended. Purchased for my nieces and they enjoyed it a lot when we watched it as a family on movie night."
3,Good family movie.,Really cute movie. Simply with a lot of pep. It is like a live action version of a Judy Blume book.
5,Little Secrets,"A delightful family movie. Our 10-yr-old has proclaimed it her all time favorite. Refreshing, strong family values."
4,"Very Good, But Not Excellent","As an undergrad taking his first finance class, I have have found this book to be quite useful. The concepts are explained in simplified, less-complicated ways and make reading each chapter less frustrating than perhaps some others (compared to some of the econ texts that I have had to use!).It is well-written, concise, and employs some very straightforward, easy-to-follow graphs/diagrams. Also, both the formulas and the exercises at the end of each chapter are quite useful.The only reason that I did not give it a 5-star rating is because some of the chapters did not use enough ""real-world examples"" or hypothetical situations in some of the more challenging lessons. This might better aid those students who are new to finance or simply need another angle to better grasp the idea."
4,A Good Start In Finance,"I teach corporate finance, investment finance and Islamic finance related courses in business schools at MBA level in Karachi Pakistan. Having read and taught from several books on corporate finance, this title by far seems the best. I haven't yet seen the ninth edition, but it must be following the same track as prior editions. The chaptering as well as each chapter's headings are sequential and the method of explaining each heading is impressive. End of the chapter review of formulas is the best part, and finally the end of the chapter ""discussion questions"" and ""problems"" enable the students to grasp the concepts presented in the chapters in a nice manner indeed. I have recommended this book in several business schools in Pakistan."
5,Text for up & coming Business Professionals,"This is a great text, has a lot of ratios and explainations of why one would use them."
4,Diameter of polywire,"I had no idea how thick this would be. It turns out it is fairly thin stuff, not even as thick as baling twine.To give you an idea of size, the whole spool is about 30% larger than the size of a 16oz soda can (see my picture above with the twine next to a US 1 cent piece)I use it with porcelain insulator on a metal gate to stop horses pushing against it to get to the hay barn. I dont think its visibility would be that great if run in the pastures. For us the gate was the barrier and the polywire the enforcer. I would not run this on its own across any distance, it is just too thin."
4,Great Product!,"I bought this for my 89 VW Golf. The boot is great, the kit is a little off. They give you everything pictured but the smaller clamp was a little big and if you mess it up you have to rip it off and we ended up using a zip tie. Everything else matched up perfectly. The grease didn't come in that nice looking tube but in a plastic packet thing but it was grease nun-the-less. Installation was almost effortless just like it says, you don't have to remove the entire axle. So for the experienced mechanic he had everything done in under 30 min. All the other stuff we didnt use. You can if you choose to replace all the little things in the kit but we found all the original stuff as serviceable and fit fine so we didn't use it."
2,ultimate risk?,"This book was great! I couldn't put it down. I'm so glad that Cristina went into racing like her mom,Ashliegh. I was a little disapointed about the end though. Ican't wait until the next book to come out. I always race though them!"
5,LOVE IT,I just loved the whole book. I dont know why they called it Ultimate Risk. It wasnt much of Risk. She just had to pick one horse or the other. But I liked the different horse and its back ground. anyway. I like it! (when is Joeanna coming back? and the other people and horses>? )
1,That was not good! ..........,"That was the absolute worst book in the series. I have been waiting for this book for months. I liked all the other ones (even the last few). I CAN NOT believe that in the last what is it 4 books they have been preping Star for these races and how badly Chris wanted to ride and then she blows it! She only wanted what was best for herself so that SHE would be a ""famous"" jockey. That was really bad. Usually I finish these books in like 45 minutes but this one just dragged on and on. I really would NOT recommed that you read it. Read all the other books in he series but NOT this."
4,Ultimate Risk,"I think this book was pretty good. I like how Christina and Parker are basically going out. I think that they make a good couple but just one question, Say they get married in the future, Parker is probly going to take over townsend acers and christina will own whitebrook, how would they live together? I dont want to jump to conclitions but I think its somthing to think about. I really like in the book how Christina wins Gratis's trust in racing, and Vince likes her. I think it really was for the best that she raced againsted Star, and the best horse did win. But i do miss all the old characters. I think in a future book Cristina should take a really good jumping lesson on Sterling and win an event or somthing, but still be with Star. I really think they should have a few more jumping books. What would be totaly asume is if they had another jumping book with Samantha!"
4,Notice any similarities?,"Ok, maybe it's just me, but does anyone else notice how the trainer, Vince Jones, kinda acts like Charlie did? Ya know, never giving much praise to his rider and stuff. And does anyone else think that Melanie hanging on Steve Quinn's every word is kinda like Ashleigh's sister, Caroline, hanging on Brad Townsend's every word back when Wonder was racing? If so, email me and let me know. Other than that, the book was good, although there are better ones in the series."
4,THIS BOOK IS GREAT!,I have to tell you. This book is among greats! It almost takes you back to the same sense as the first books in the series. I'm so thrilled that Christina shares a strong bond with Star but she is able to realize that there are other important horses too. The only thing that bugged me about this book was how the author dragged out Melaine's depression! I loved this book! I hope you do to!
2,New Authors!,"When it started out the books were grrrrrrreat! But now since other authors have taken over the series, first of all they don't get the facts right, like it wasn't Ashleigh that won the Kentucky Derby on Wonder, it was Gilly. Also, they are changing the characters. For instance, Christina used to want to have nothing to do with racing. Then she met this nice, strong, fast, and calm horse, (and even that right there is pretty hard to come by i would think.) Anyway this horse changes her dreams, makes her sell her good horse Sterling, and turn to become a jockey! I just think the change should have been gradual if anything. I think that they could be a lot better if the author took more time"
1,What happened?,"I don't get it. If you guys have read thoroughbred number twenty three, Cindy's Honor, you will remember that Ashley could not ride Honor because she was pregnant. So shouldn't Christina Have a baby brother or sister right about now. The thoroughbred authors have a really hard time sticking to the plot and I think that the books are getting really old, predictible and boring."
2,Okay,"This book was okay. I still think these books should be about WHITEBROOK. I wasn't pleased with the Gratis plot line one bit. I thought Christina was so dedicated to Star and wanted to ride him so much, so in my opinion, in sticking with the character that's she's been created as, she would have ridden Star. But the plot twists were interesting. The books are much more realistic then ever. However, some parts were still lacking in detail. Also, there still seems to be a lack in relationship between Star and Christina. Too much time is focused on the races, there's little character development outside the track, and there aren't really subplots any more. Subplots make the book interesting, and can be insightful. Other then that, this was an okay book, but I think that two weeks of the series' time shouldn't have been wasted on this plot. Please oh please more Whitebrook! We wanted racing, not just races!"
3,"Not bad, but too West-centric","Overall, this book gave a decent general overview of Christian mysticism. My biggest complaint, though, was that there was too much focus on the West (and when the editor did use authors from the East, he chose pieces which are more in tune with Western Christianity than Eastern). There was also too much focus on very small heretical movements (why so many quotes from the Quietists?); their presence in the book was disproportionate to their presence in history. Not bad, but there's much better out there."

3,"Good book, but a bit dated","This book is packed with beautiful full-color photographs of hot rods and custom cars. However, styles have changed and a lot of the cars look dated now in 2010. I recommend it if you are just getting into these kinds of cars, but if you are a die hard rod or kustom guy this may be too out of step with current trends."
5,A King is born,"We have the greatest period of Rock n Roll on one disc. It chronicles Elvis in 1956, when he WAS the King of Rock N Roll. It would be all downhill from here though. This disc is not a must for music fans, it is a birthright."
5,"A REAL Album...Elvis, the Legend","I am a 14 year old fan of the KING, despite of my age, I love Elvis. This album recorded most of Elvis recording in 1956. I can said this is my first collection of Elvis' songs."
5,Power of the prophet,"With the release of this powerful tome of prophecy, Lahaye and Jenkins are sure to rise to the level of popularity of Hal Lindsey in the timeliness and accuracy of their many predictions. Prophet writers such as Lahaye and Lindsay have saved many souls in recent decades with their stunning prophecies. I can only pray they will go on to greater heights. Their amazing ability to understand both past and future events with 100% certainty is powerful evidence of their ability to interpret scripture. I am sure this is just the beginning of a line of new prophets.This book occupies pride of place on my bookshelf along with other prophecy greats such as ""1994?"" by Harold Camping, ""666 : The Final Warning"" by Gary Blevins and ""Gorbachev! Has the Real Antichrist Come?"" by Robert Faid. I encourage readers to look up these books as excellent examples of recent prophecy that highlight many of my concerns."
5,Very interesting book,"Gives you a lot to think about, I have loaned it to others and they enjoyed it also. I love prophecy books."
1,Amazement,"I was astonished as I read your lengthy review of your peer's book, ""Are We Living in the End Times"" (Tim LaHaye). I noticed while reading your ""review"" that you really weren't reviewing the book at all, which is what the space is for, but you were preaching. Then, I realized that you were touting your own book. I think you owe Mr. LaHaye an apology."
1,For serious fantasy lovers only,"Please read this book. If you believe it then you won't be needing any of your worldly goods or cash anymore so please send it all to me. Anyone ignorant enough to believe in this nonsense shouldn't be allowed to vote, drive, or reproduce. Historians can not accurately even prove who wrote the bible, yet millions of people believe it as the word of God. So why would anyone believe a book, supposedly taken from the scriptures as facts? Read Mother Goose, it's much more believable."
3,"interesting, but don't hold your breath","Pretty good info here on end time events,sort of an 'update'on Hal lindsey's LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH.Hal's book is 30 years old,and I remember as a kid hearing those around me thinking that the rapture was going be to VERY soon.The Catholic position on this subject seems to be more of a 'wait and see, just be ready ANYWAY for Christ's return'. be very aware that this is a more of a protestant teaching than anything. There is no true unity of faith in Christiandom,and until that happens I believe Christ may not come for a very, very long time to come.We are too 'fragmented'on beliefs and sunday mornings are still the most segregated time in America. Do you really think Christ will come back to this 'mess'? Sure he will 'clean'things up when he returns, but we have alot of cleaning up to do ourselves before that happens."
1,When were the end times?,"The question is: ""Are we living in the end times?Jesus and the apostles clearly say no, for they told their contemporary readers that they were living in the last days of the age. If Jesus and the apostles were wrong, then Christianity and the Bible is wrong. But since Jesus and the apostles wrote and spoke inerrantly that they themselves and their readers were in the last days, then Lahaye and Jenkins are clearly wrong and unbiblical in saying that the end times (the last days) are any time after the time of the apostles and their contemporary readers to whom they told they were in the last days.Either the Bible is right or Jenkins/ Lahaye is right. It can't be both. Whom will you choose?"
1,"Makes one wonder what the definition of ""false prophets"" is.",This is either an entertaining work of fiction or a very disturbed set of beliefs. Anyone looking to find the Spirit of Christ should certainly look elsewhere.
4,Are We Living in the End times?,"Fascinating reading! Many of the predictions have come true and we are certainlyheading in that direction. Bible scholars will be able to relate. The further I got into the book, the harder it was to put it down. Atheists beware!"
1,ME ME ME ME ME,"Generations of sad dingbats have stood on mountains waiting for some all-important 'End Time', and when the predicted dates come and go, is anyone dissuaded?Of course not. They just re-interpret the same old ambiguities and come up with another date. ""No, really, THIS TIME we KNOW we've got it right.""Because books like this exploit the terminally self-centred, who want it all to be about 'ME'.""I"" will be there when it all happens. It's all for ""MY"" generation. It's all focused on ""ME"".LaHaye and Jenkins clearly capitalise on these feelings, as have generations before them.Nobody ever went broke overestimating the gullibility of the human race."
1,Political Propaganda,"The writers are pointing fingers at China, Russia and all other nations as the 'Evil Babylon'. Very little is said about USA itself. The reason, because the writers live in USA! This is a very biased book and has a hidden political agenda: Pan-Americanism. These two authors are better politicians and propagandalist than christian scholars. Honest christians should read this book with a grain of salt."
5,Precious Insight,This book is a helpful tool in understanding biblical history in relation to the future of mankind. Very helpful.
5,This book is a MUST for believers!,Lahaye has an annointed grip on interpretation of endtime prophecy! This book is easy to understand and it answers a myriad of questions for the Christian believer interested in the prophetic words of the Bible. I found out things I never knew and I have been studying this stuff for 15 years er so! Great book Tim! Keep it up!
1,Suttle and Subversive,"This is an easy to read book, containing interesting stories and illustrations. Unfortunately it plays the evangelical card - ""we are good Christians who believe the Bible - therefore you should trust our easy and simple methods."" Alas, to the unsuspecting reader this evaluation of the end times is riddled with cleverly disguised dispensational presuppositions. It also includes misrepresentations of conflicting viewpoints - encouraging the reader not to examine the evidence for themselves but to take LaHaye's word for it. Frankly LaHaye though an entertaining writer has set himself up suttley in the same way as medieval Roman Catholicism. ""To question me is to question God"" And no-one wants to do that."
3,Accurate,"Tim LaHaye(Like Lindsay, Van Impe, Hagee, etc.,) once again shows that he is not afraid to interpret Bible prophecy litterally. Tim returns to his roots in writing this book. It is a good introductory book for bible prophecy with a loads of content. This book is only for those who seek the truth. The return of Christ is near."
5,Excellent book!,"This book is great for any one wanting to know if we are ""Living in the End Times"". I found it easy to read, not complicated at all. It's a great book to read if you are familiar with the Left Behind series. I highly recommend this book for any one wanting a good end time events book."
4,Curious about end time events?,This is a great book for anyone looking for insight on the prophecies surrounding the Rapture and associated events. LaHaye and Jenkins do a wonderful job of using scripture to support their opinion that we have more reason than any generation before us to believe that the Rapture will happen sometime in our generation.
5,A great reference for Christians and non-believers alike.,"I suspect that no one was more surprised at the enormous success of the 'Left Behind' novels than the authors, Jerry Jenkins and Dr. Tim LaHaye. Although this book is obviously packaged to appeal to readers of the series, there's real meat here, much of it derived from two earlier books by Dr. LaHaye on the book of Revelation and the on-going debate over the timing of the Rapture. Christians familiar with biblical prophecies of the end-times will find this a handy reference, while readers with no real Bible knowledge will find a lot to think about. Both groups will enjoy the historical references and background, particularly those relating to the modern-day regathering of the nation of Israel after so many centuries in exile. Agree or disagree, no one will be bored by this book! Read it, ponder it, then ask yourself: ""Could all this really happen in my lifetime?"" You may be surprised by your final answer. Enjoy."
5,Great book to add to your collection,"Being a huge fan of the anime series, I had to get a hold of this book. The artwork is very good, being able to see the story flow from one panel to the next. The translation is good, but there were some discrepancies. For example, how the silver pocket that all the state alchemist possess in the anime are in fact gold and how Fuhrer King Bradley in the anime is referred to as the President in the manga. Not really a big deal and doesn't really change the overall quality of the story. The story tends to be slightly more comical than the actual anime and Edward seems more sadistic in this version. Overall, I would still highly recommend this to all FMA fans and anyone who's willing to get into anime for the first time."
4,"great guide to things to do, good rural atlas","This atlas has nearly all the back roads in the state, labled by number (which is not always on the street sign). It does not have any detail in cities and large towns, just the main streets. But it has a great guide to things to do: parks and forests, some hiking trails, all the private campgrounds in the state, some bike routes, some canoe trips, lots of info on places to fish and hunt, tons of historic sites and museums of all kinds, civil war sites, gardens, wildlife viewing areas, unique natural features, some wineries, a few waterfalls, several senic drives, and even boat trips. A great guide for exploring the state, though you will need a regular highway map as well."
5,great basic beginner's book!,I was interested in getting cockatiels as pets & picked up this book to learn more about these birds before I bought them. I found this book to be VERY informative & gave me plenty of knowledge about these birds & led me to buy them. I keep refering back to this book almost daily since I picked up the birds a week ago.
1,An archaic collection of cockatiel information.,"Having bred and raised cockatiels for 13 years, I can unequivocally state that this book contains little or no helpful information about cockatiels. In fact, there is a great deal of misinformation. For example, the genetics section contains incorrect information regarding the breeding of albino cockatiels, treating albino as if it were one gene instead of a combination of lutino and whiteface. Another good example of Mr. Vriend's use of archaic information is that he recommends peat moss in the nestbox, which can cause fungal growth leading to aspergillosis, which is a serious lung disease.My recommendation: read a book written by someone who has recently bred cockatiels."
2,Nice from a distance,"This American Expedition Wildlife Mug looked great in the photo. It is indeed stainless steel and seems to be able to do a fine job of holding coffee etc. The big disappointment with this mug is that the beautiful picture is really just a piece of paper stuck inside a piece of plastic. I noticed that the picture was not printed on as soon as I opened the box and I don't think it would fool anyone except in a photo. Also because of the paper picture, the mug must be hand washed so that the paper doesn't get wet. What can you expect from a cheap mug made in China?"
4,Mug,The travel mug more than meet my expectations. It maintain the coffee warm for a long time. Very good mug
1,Can't even hand wash!,"I just put it down it soapy water, washed the inside out and then went around the outside, turned it upside down to dry and a while later I checked to see if it was dry and noticed one side of the paper picture was wet!!! I am very disappointed!!! I have bought nine different ones so far but I don't want to wast anymore money when they will get ruined so easily. For them to be so expensive they should have been sealed to keep the moister out it's such a wast on such pretty art!!!"
5,great purchase,It was exactly as I pictured it with nice packaging. It made for a nice gift. Four more words required?
1,do not buy from this person,"i ordered a book from this person and almost 30 days later they still haven't even processed it to ship, this was terrible!!!!"
2,"Not bad, but not great","Unlike the other Chemical Engineering courses I took, this was the most abstract. This book was boring to read. The only reason I understand process control was because the teacher supplemented the course with some additional material. This book gives the necessary basics but does not go into great detail (could be either good or bad) and gives very weak example problems. The homework problems are much better (try and figure that one out!). Thankfully, Seborg has a new edition out. Let's hope it's better than the previous."
3,Not so great..,Very boring bland book with examples that were not very helpful. Nothing was aimed at real world examples which does not help a student relate to why the curriculum is useful.
5,This is the ONLY chemical engineering book that I like,"Four years of chemical engineering education and finally, a book worth remembering. Seborg leaves nothing out. From the simplest principles to the weirdest homework problems, the book does a great job of TEACHING, not just INFORMING. As a reference, it might not be too great, but for pure teaching effect, this is the absolute best choice."
3,"Good explanations, but frequent typos.","Overall, this book helped me make sense of a fairly difficult course. Unfortunately, I would often find myself spinning my wheels trying to solve example problems and derive equations that were full of typos. I know all textbooks have errors, but this one seemed worse than most. I would highly recommend downloading the errata list before reading anything. The book provided pretty clear explanations of most topics, but some things were out of order and seemed a little confusing. Rudimentary topics that had been used throughout the entire text and were necessary to understand parts of many chapters were explained late in the book and were often difficult to find. Many of the example problems also did not show solutions in enough depth."
2,IKKY,"So to begin, This book was absolute hell. It gave a pretty good overview of what the class was about. But it contains over 200 errors (don't believe me?? go to the wiley site) this made the class incredibly hard to do because when I had assignments I would end up proceeding and come to a hault and realize my answer wasn't correct. I would come to find out that that problem contained an error in it. If you are really into this type of major then I would say to choose a different book"
3,"Good story, not particularly like Jane Austen's writing","Teverton Hall was an enjoyable story, but the only likeness to Jane Austen's writing was the introduction of Mr. and Mrs. Collins from Pride and Prejudice. Mr. Collins' tirades are pretty true to life, but occurring so frequently, tend to become very annoying. Borrow it from the library if you can, but I wouldn't advise purchasing it."
4,heartwarming love story,"Wonderful story of adults and children looking for love, each in their own way. Booker, disillusioned by previous encounbters with women, wants more than just physical love. Thea thinks herself unattractive and unloveable. These feelings of insecurity, result in a lack of fatih in Booker's love for her. The children, even though young, have their own problems with accepting and giving love. A very rewarding well paced story."
2,The Epilogue Would have Been a Better Story,"I have read a lot of Cheryl St.John's books, and always liked them, but not this one.I know that all the reviewers loved this book except me, but I could barely figure out what it was about until half-way through the book. I got so frustrated that I almost didn't finish it, but kept hoping it would get better. It didn't.Never in my life have I read a book where there was so much ""He/she doesn't love me, or does he/she love me?"" Thea was tall, overly giving, with a poor self-image. Booker didn't seem to have a problem to me, but I guess he did as he couldn't get old Thea in the bed which was more or less what this story was about.The book had a good epilogue that would have made a much better story than this one."
4,An Extensive Treatise on Depression and Psychiatry,"This classic book: is opulent, is bright, and takes the fear of psychotherapy and antidepressants. It is not a classical self help book. It addresses depressive people and their relatives.`The Secret Strength of Depression' supplies the reader with a lot of background material on the topic depression. Flach uses the word depression not only for the clinical cases, but also for people in grief and for people in a longish phase of depressive mood.In this book you will learn about psychotherapeutical treatment und treatment with different kinds of drugs. The biological background of them is explained. Flach claims there is no addiction with antidepressants.In spite of the heavy topic one gets a relatively light read. Though a very lengthy read."
5,best gluten free organic crackers on the market. Thanks Mary,I chose to be gluten free since I believe it is a better lifestyle but the hardest part is findingconvienent tasty foods. I love these crackers my favorites are original and pepper. Thanks Mary!
1,Only for Celiacs patients!,"These are rice crackers and not very good ones. There are many other brands of rice crackers that are really moist and flavourful from Japan. If I had Celiacs disease I might consider having these around but you can't serve these to guests without a lot of explaining and some really sharp cheese. Be wary of making a 12 box commitment. Also these crackers come in a bag which means between 10%-25% are broken and they cannot be resealed which means they go flat very quickly. If you bought these and don't know what to do with them try opening the box and leaving it in the bathroom when you shower, it reduces the choking hazard. If you still can't adjust put them in a Zip-Lock and use them as packing material."
3,Lack of pepper,These have always been my favorite cracker and I buy them by the 12 pack. The last 2 twelve packs have been noticeably lacking in black pepper! In fact they don't really have much flavor at all. I will get the Caraway or Original next time.
5,This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found.,This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found. This was a great find. The price was the best I’ve found.
4,Avenging Angelo DVD,"I know this flic isn't going down in history as one of the great comedies, but I am not a professional critic, and I watch movies for the pure enjoyment of them. This one I liked - period! And that's saying a lot, considering that I'm not real crazy about Stalone."
1,HORRIBLE WASTE OF TALENT!!!!,"Where should I start...Anthony Quinn was incoherent and difficult to understand...someone put him out of his misery and have him retire already....Stalone...well the name speaks for itself...Madeline ... why oh why did you get mixed up in this project??? Has your career come to an end?? Sylvester is obviously, finally off the steriods, because in this movie, he was so thin and drawn. He hardly had any muscle mass. It did not look like him...is he wearing a wig in this movie? One time box-office attractions got together and made this movie. WHY WHY WHY??? I want my money back, I want my 90 minutes of my life back. G A R B A G E and jokes were very corny. Stallone looked like he was sleeping half the time."
4,I'm surprised by the bad reviews here.,"In my view this is far from being as terrible as some reviewers suggest. In fact I can honestly say I enjoyed both Sylvester Stallone and Madelaine Stowe, whose chemistry was obvious and very pleasant. The plot is not as good as the acting, which is subtle and fun, but even when the story hits low points it's all in a light comedic spirit so who really cares. Good job Sly."
3,not quite MST3K material....,"I first saw this just because it had 'Stallone', and 'comedy' in the same sentence...that combination means the movie will be funny as hell..but not intentionally...so i started watching it..and now I actually like it enough to buy it....and that says alot. The only other Stallone movie I own is First Blood...good action movie, and then this one, good action/comedy movie in the same manner...THIS one is predictable as hell, you KNOW how itll turn out, before even finishing it, I knew what the last scene would be...enough said, but still worth the RENT"
1,Quinn's Unfortunate Swan Song,"A straight-to-video Sylvester Stallone turkey, ""Avenging Angelo"" (2002) contains the last screen performance of Anthony Quinn. Sadly, the legendary actor deserved a better finale - and viewers deserved much better than this romantic-comedy dreck. Stallone's agreeable presence cannot redeem such hopeless material."
2,well?---hmmmnn!,"I did not hate the movie, I found it quaint with a very hurried up finale. I do think the humor was there, but the writers could have done a better job with it. I think sly and madeline had a decent chemistry but failed to captilize on that area. this movie could be stated as a guilty pleasure but could have been better. rent it, but keep it cheap and have a good time with it and the popcorn."
2,BEWARE! FALSE ADVERTISING!!,"Andy Garcia is NOT in this movie. AND, it's a crappy movie. If you loathe Stallone as much as I do, DO NOT buy this movie."
1,"And you thought ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was a bad movie.",I can't believe that this was a major production. Awful. Terrible. A waste of money.
3,NO TIENE SUBTITULOS AL ESPAÑOL,"Independientemente de lo que pueda decirse de la pelicula, se avisa a los compradores hispanos que este dvd NO TIENE SUBTITULOS NI IDIOMA AL ESPAÑOL, a diferencia de lo dicho en la descripcion del producto. Ya esta avisados."
5,good fit,love this coffee maker and did not wanna replace the whole thing. very cool to find just the one piece i needed. saved me a lotta money and time thanks
2,Worked Great for a while.,Used it periodically for small minor projects. Lightly used for 13 months now. The torque function no longer works on it so i have a hard time screwing anything down. There is a 1 year warranty on it but item broke a month after warranty :(
4,what is it ?,don't expect a regular recording. expect the unexpected. then change your mind. extreme music ? i don't think so. same as the previous albums ? i don't think so. different to earlier recordings ? yes and no. it ain't celine dion. is it better ? up to you to decide. 15 tracks all different or all the same ? listen and enjoy or don't - your choice
5,WOW!,"This product is fantastic! I started a home detox program and now this is part of my regimen. During detox you must eliminate those toxins and quickly. This product helps with ""die off symptoms"". No cramping, I was able to go to work and have no discomfort. If you have a history of constipation this is a must have. You won't be disappointed."
5,Miracle pills!,"I've been using Oxy-Powder for almost a year now and I can't imagine being without it! Never gives cramps, just keeps you regular! I absolutely love this product and recommend it to everyone!"
4,It does Help,I ended up scaling back from what the dosage says and I just take one a day. That seems to work good for me and keeps me regular. Still a very loose stool and still sometimes can barely make it to the bathroom in time but I guess it's better than not going for days.
3,works but be careful,"even though it works this product made me sick. i weighed 275 pounds and am 6'2"". i took 4 pills as suggested on the bottle for a week every day and drank the amount of water suggested. i didn't make it to the end of the week after the fourth day i had magnesium poisoning ,all this from 16 total pills spread out over 4 days.my back was in pain , i was sick ,throwing up, and peeing out my butt . i laid in bed sick for 2 days. . also the pills don't taste or feel good going down you will no what i mean if you take it long enough.it works but use less than what they say to or else."
1,Did not work for me.,Simply this product did not work for me. I followed the directions as stated. I added more pills daily and drank water with lemon.This product was a waste of money.Congrats to the people it did work for.
5,Works great with no cramping,"This product has been a godsend for me. The cost is high yes, but the results are worth it for me. I am on many medications that cause constipation, so without oxy powder I'd be miserable."
4,A Little Cumbersome,"good winter jacket for most climates, shell is NOT good waterproof, like most DWR.i now have a patagonia fleece that i wear inside a marmot shell and like it a lot more fit wise."
1,Rip-off part 2,"The only part of this video that generated any heat was the second to last segment, two brunettes take an outdoor shower together, about 2 1/2 minutes...not too bad considering the PB record for g-g, dismal to say the least. And as for PM's getting it on...forget about it! There is more contact on the box cover. When it comes to PM's getting intimate, good old HMH is still back in 1953."
4,"Not a bad video, but could have been a LOT sexier!","Let's face it, Playboy's got the best-looking women, so this is obviously going to be a hot tape! But when it comes to girl-girl erotica, they're still somewhat lacking in originality and creativity. And too often they feel compelled to include a guy or two, or just have the girls prance around naked in front of eachother. It's sexy, but hardly erotic. Nevertheless, I applaud the effort, and hope they'll continue trying."
3,yet another Playboy disappointment,"I didn't see Girlfriends 1, but judging by some of the reviews, this would seem to be more of the same, perhaps even less so. Sapphic interludes are VERY brief and fleeting, and a good portion of the scenes feature no ""interaction"" whatsoever. The models, while certainly attractive, are also just as certainly NOT the best Playboy has to offer. If the most beautiful Playboy centerfold rated an A+, the majority of these girls would get a B- at best. Too bad, as I thought maybe Playboy would move into the 21st century with this one.."
2,Not really,Not so fussy about this one. I don't like where it's headed. I couldn't finish it. I usually like time travel romance but this one was too strange for my liking.
4,Just a Tad Greasier Than I Would prefer,"The Terra Sweet Potato chips are a delicious all-natural snack.No surprises on the ingredient list, and not only do I enjoy the taste, my family does as well.The only thing that I could fault the chips for are that they are greasier than I would prefer. If they had a ""baked"" option for these chips that had similar flavor, I'd probably go for those.All in all, priced right, taste great. If you don't mind some light grease, awesome. In the case of these chips, I don't mind all that much."
2,Too Much Cumin,I thought I tried something different rather than just plain old potato chips. The cumin flavor was very strong in one bag while another bag was light in cumin (and better for my taste buds). The flavor was just too overwhelming for me. I would not buy this product again.
1,"stale chips , and lots of them","the item was ordered on august 2nd, arrived on the 11th with a best by date of august 30th!! i had ordered to stock up on a healthy snack but instead got a case of chips that are already stale , and tasteless. amazon made it right but i am disappointed to receive old product. I imagine these would taste great if they were fresh!!"
2,Don't Buy These,"I bought these for my husband. He thought they were plain. I didn't like the taste at all. The spiced sweet potato ones are better, but my husband who loves sweet potatoes didn't like them at all."
4,Decent flavor ...,"I tried the ""Sea Salt"" variety crinkle-cut chips and they were pretty good. A little thicker than I'd anticipated, so harder to eat. But the flavor was good, with just the right amount of salt. Not sure I'll purchase this variety again, but I might try one of the others."
1,Terra Krinkle cut Sweet potatoes chips,These SweetPotatoes chips are okay and taste okay. You would have to aquire a taste for this kind of chip
2,Way over-cooked. Some chips look like carbon!,"I do NOT understand why they have to fry/bake for so long?? If they were not so over cooked, I would love it. Too bad!So far, I only opened one bag, I hope not ALL 12 bags are like this, although they may very well be since they must have been made and bagged together. I will have to complain to the manufacturer if that is the case!"
2,Unique taste!,"If you are looking for a healthier alternative to a potato chip with the same taste, LOOK FURTHER!! These chips taste COMPLETELY different than a white potato chip. I was definitely surprised when biting into this chip--it tastes saltless and almost bitter! Tastes a little like fried plantain bananas--definitely not on my top ten list of favorite snack food!"
5,ALWAYS A FAVORITE WITH US!,"I especially have always loved these. I always bought the larger bags at the store before. It was too easy to eat one bag in one sitting that way. There are 3 of us plus our dogs, 1 parrot and 1 cockatiel who get one now and then too. I found out that sweet potato chewies are best and safest for dogs and birds and are sold at the Dr. Harvey's pet food site. I am ordering those for my animals now as I think they may be safer- less likely to cause choking. I am ordering some more of these , the small bags, for us now and it has been only 2 weeks. We went through 24 bags. Gotta have em! Oh and I was very impressed at the way these were packaged for shipping. They were insulated so well not one broken chip from shipping I guarantee!

3,the sweet potato one are better than the combo,i ordered this based on my experience with the sweet potato bags. i thought the combo would be better. but the krinkle kind fails in comparison to the normal seet potato because they are a lot more oily and they are burned with a burned taste
2,Unique flavor/smell; Explosive packaging,"I am a big fan of Terra sweet potato chips for their nutrition and flavor, so I figured I would try the spiced chips. They aren't terrible, but something about the smell reminds me of body odor. I would imagine it is the cumin, so for some it might be an acquired taste.As for the packaging; They were delivered and left in the sun for a couple hours (we are currently having a 100+ heat wave) and 7/12 of the bags exploded in the box. I think Terra may put too much air in the bags."
1,Not Good,"I rely on reviews when making decisions on purchases. So I felt it was important to leave a review myself.I love sweet potato chips, but this product is not good at all. I thought the small bags would be good for portion control, buy I couldn't get through the first bag. The chips tasted stale. Unfortunately it was a bad purchase for me."
2,too salty,Wow way too salty for my taste. They really need to cut back on it or just do it natural without salt.
2,Eh...,Great taste. But why do they insist on saving money using safflower oil instead of canola oil. They say may contain 'canola or safflower or...etc'. But they always contain the cheap oils that I'm allergic to. I'd be a frequent flyer on these chips if they'd just do them so I won't get sick.
4,Great socks but made of thick yarn.,Shoes must be a roomy to fit these socks. They didn't work for my husband because they made the shoe fit too tight..
3,Feel funny,"These socks have a weird grainy feel to them. To me, they are not soft and feel stringy around the ankles..."
5,"I love these socks , I just wish I could obtain a larger quantity per order","Best wearing, sturdy socks especially for anyone who has exprienced any kind of foot surgery or injury. After 30 years of looking these are the ' Mother load "" Can't get enough of them."
3,REALLY Thick,"These are well-made, quality socks, but they are REALLY thick and may not work for everyone. I bought them to replace some old-style Champion High Performance (which are now a cheap, imported imitation of the earlier version), but the Wigwam's are simply too thick. The search continues."
2,too expensive,$15.33 for 1 pair??? I was shure stupid not to check the number of pairs of socks I was getting .it will not happen again!
3,Not quite the same,"I had already owned some Wigwam socks, and was looking for that extremely soft, padded feel. These socks do have a good full padding at the sole, however the socks do not seem as flexible as my older ones - I'm hoping this might improve a little over time, but it may be too early to tell..."
1,sizing?,"Never available in Large, the single most popular size? What kind of marketing madness is that? Makes no sense at all."
4,These things are not normal socks.,"If your looking for normal socks, then these are not for you.These things are SUPER THICK, and feel like your wearing 3 pairs of socks.if you need really heavy socks for some reason, then these are what your looking for, whether it's for winter, or hiking, or medical conditions, or just for wearing around the house, then they'll work great.The quality is very good, and is definitely a sock that will probably last you years."
3,White Crew Socks,"These socks are well made, but are too thick to wear with anything but very over-sized shoes or slippers."
5,Sooo Soft!!!!,"They are so soft and so amazing. I hate wearing socks, but these are amazing!Need eight more words to post this review."
2,Socked,"One pair of crew socks was included in the sale. This wasn't made clear in the product description, especially since most others come in multiple pairs. This item is very expensive and not much better in quality or comfort compared to the less expensive crew socks I've tried."
2,Not So Great,"This book was a chore to get through. I finished it all, but there were some points where I wished it would have just ended. There was a lot of reiteration and not enough interpretation of events and personalities by the author. The reader can form their own interpretation of Ivan early on in the book and after that it just drags on and on. This book could have been great, it wasn't terrible, it just needed to be shorter."
1,Keep looking...,"I wasn't impressed by this slow read. It is very dull at most points which one would think would be hard to do considering the antics and terror that encompassed Ivan's reign. I think there are better biographies, keep looking."
4,"Fast, exciting read!","I read fiction to relax and escape, and prefer a rollicking, fast paced adventure novel, and Alan delivers on that in RealmShift.I enjoyed the supernatural themes and religious comment that was intertwined with the gory action. The anti-hero was compelling and I am keen for the next instalment!My only comment would be that the women in the book were typecast and could be more complex - they could be evil as well!Thanks Alan!"
5,A must read,"Realmshift is action packed and keeps you wanting more, with a plot that builds to an exciting crescendo. The characters are three dimensional, and you find yourself caring about what happens to the `bad guys' as well as the good.The clashing of various religions and philosophies adds another depth to the story, and seems to draw influences from a huge number of sources. From Moorcocks view of Hell, to the humorous Angels in the likes of the film `Dogma' and Pratchett and Gamens `Good Omens', a dash of Mayan culture with some Zen philosophy on the side, Baxter keeps the reader both interested and amused.If you, like me have found yourself getting tired of the usual stuff being churned out by well known authors, then give this book a read. You will not be disappointed."
1,Or Not.,"This book was NOT HOT! It came off as uninformed and I just don't think it is a good Idea to present a social situation like that when Kit was not the main character. It is impossible to understand that situation unless you have been there so the book felt phony and unrealistic in reference to the overall mood. And Kit was obviously immature and unable too raise the baby, yet she kept her child. What kind of message is that sending to our young people? I would not want my daughter read this book because of its unrealistic plot and questionable morals."
4,fire: the very bestof the pointer sisters,"The pointer sisters are probably one of the most underated groups around. Although this set may be a bit much for someone who is not a big fan, this set is probably one of the most extensive collections you can find that has material covering the Pointers' wide range of material dating from the 70's-80's. And believe me, they've gone through many different styles and do each style very well, with much taste, and great harmonies. They have the type of blend that only sisters can have.With this collection you get the best of their major hits and the best of some of their less popular cuts.Besides their hits, tracks such as ""Happiness"", ""Dreaming as One"", ""She's got the Fever"", ""The Love Too Good to Last"", ""Goldmine"" and ""He Turned Me Out"" feature the sisters at their best and make this worth the buy. Enjoy!"
4,All the good stuff but a tad too much fluff,"As best I can tell, this is the only CD with the extended version of ""Fairytale"" (which was reason enough for me to buy it). The Pointer Sisters have done much very good work, just about all of it on this album.""Jump"", Neutron Dance"", ""Slow Hand"", How Long"" and a big big handful of tunes make this worth having. However, there are just too many songs to be skipped over, and the Sisters didn't have (in my opinion) enough strong material to make a ""Very Best Of"" collection into two discs."
3,'70's POINTERS RULE,"I see this POINTER SISTER'S Double CD collection as a tribute to Richard Perry.Don't get me wrong..he produced some mighty fine POINTER hits.BUT the POINTERS in the 70's were more creative and had LOTS more fun than the 80's POP-COMMERCIALIZED songs heard here.Just listen to tracks 2 through 5 to hear the SOUND that caught EVERYONE's attention.Pointer Fans will buy this--I DID--but I keep going back to the songs that REMAIN FRESHHeres my POINTERS DOUBLE CD....FIREDisc 11 Duke Ellington Medley2 Sugar3 Little Pony4 Betcha Got A Chick On The Side5 River Boulevard6 Shaky Flat Blues7 Save the Bones For Henry Jones8 Naked Foot9 Yes We Can Can10 Black Coffee11 Bangin on the Pipes/Steam Heat12 Jada13 Going Down SlowlyDisc 21 That's A Plenty/Surfeit, USA2 Cloudburst3 Old Songs4 Chainey Do5 Don't It Drive You Crazy6 Salt Peanuts7 Easy Days8 FairyTale9 Having A Party10 Sleeping Alone11 Pains And Tears12 Wang Dang Doodle13 You Gotta Believe14 Wanting Things15 Love In Them There Hills"
4,"Amazingly small, don't take it to a brawl","This player was a very good learning experience for me in the world of electronics. Learning to use the features to their full expectations made the whole experience worthwhile. I thought this device was an appeal to joggers and runners, where it would least fit them, as this series does break easily, only had mine for about 4 months before the power button became stubborn, and turning the device on required a great deal of pressure to it. after two months of nearly squeezing it to its death, it finally gave up and I was very pooped. I came into contact with iriver and could not have a replacement from the company itself(based in Korea) but had to return to the original store of purchase and work a replacement plan. Never did, but I am seeking to buy another one of these devices."
2,Poor Quality,My player died after 6 months of very light use at my desk. I would take quality problems into account before purchasing this product.
4,I like it...,"It is a good mp3 player for the money. It has good sound quality, holds plenty of tunes for a workout and doesn't skip a all. I found that once you get it playing push the hold switch on and it will play on and on without anything to stop it. The battery life last me about a week of use with the one AA. The FM Radio is good enough for use in the gym but it's doesn't have great reception for picking up stations like my car radio does. The only real complaint is the arm band and case in the package are useless. You will need to get the armband and belt clip accessory. On another note when I first got it took me about 2 hours to figure out how to use all the functions, since then it has been easy to use."
2,Great Until it Breaks,"I had the same problem as KB from Ohio, except it happened to me after just 7 months. The unit just stopped dead, no display, in the middle of the run, middle of a song. Though I had only a few days before replaced the battery, I assumed that was the problem and changed it again. It started again, so no problem. Next run, it stopped after about 30 minutes, just dead. I did not replace the battery this time, and when I turned it on a couple of days later lo and behold it started again. Buth then halfway through my run it stopped again, dead as a doornail. This happened two more times and I gave up. Looks like I just have to get a new one. Those over priced warranties might be worth it if you really want this unit."
1,Okay if it works...,"When I began shopping for a small MP3 player to use during workouts at the gym, I looked at the same things most people would look at: features and price. The iRiver 256 MB Player seemed to meet all of my requirements, so I bought it. Then reality set in. I took it home, installed the music management software on my PC (running Windows XP), and then the nightmare began. Try as I might, I couldn't get the software to function properly. Essentially, it refused to recognize the player when I plugged it into the USB 2 port. I tried everything I could imagine, but no dice. So....I decided it was time to call tech support. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that iRiver's tech support hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Coincidentally, those are my office hours! Once it appeared that I was never going to get the software to work, OR be able to contact tech support, I packed it up and returned it. I chose a Rio 256 MB player instead, and haven't looked back."
5,"Adorable, functional little gadget!","I've had my iRiver MP3 player for a couple of months now. It's incredibly easy to maneuver as well as download songs from your computer. I've got quite a few songs on it and there's still so much room! When I got it, I also purchased another set of headphones cos I'm not a big fan of the plug thingies. I don't even use the extra headphones, these plugs are fine! My only minor complaint is that the length of cord leading the left plug is shorter than the right. What's that about? The radio plays pretty good too."
2,3000f review,"When scanning photos this scanner is everything I require.The scanning software is easy to use with a good range of options.However, when it comes to scanning slides it is most disappointing as they always come out dark.To compensate I try tweaking the brightness and contrast settings in the software but the colors in the dark areas are never true. You can play around with the image in a photo-editing program but they are always disappointing and never get near the quality of color and clarity that you get when projected onto a screen.If you want a scanner that scans slides then go for something else, and if all you need to scan is photos and documents then you don't need this scanner.Beware of reviews that appear to parrot the sales blurb."
5,"A fine, very useful book, but not for children","Clear illustrations of medieval European martial arts techniques. It very much helps, however, to understand some fundamentals of one-on-one combat, and to have others to experiment with the style until you can discover how each technique works."
3,Needs Further Interpretation,"I appreciated the pictures for their old world quality but as you can see in example pages from this webpage, the pictures are left to speak for themselves. Some are not captioned. Those that do have captions say very little and leave A LOT to be figured out by the reader. Like the Flos Duellatorum of Fiore De Liberi, these plates (pictures) need to be examined while one has a sword and partner at hand to figure out the mechanics of each maneuver. Good source for A BIT of medieval combat."
5,Good Reliable Performance,"Flexible and easy to use. Good quality. Instructions could be better and tips would have been helpful. Like how often do you add the oil? You might learn the hard way to slide along the edge without lifting the device since it is possible to miss the edge and staple the wrong surface but this probably has more do to the 1/2"" wood used."
4,Excellent tool,"I considered this item and the less expensive version offered by the same seller. I went with the more robust model based on my deep frustration in the past with 'cheap' tools. I just finished laying 850 sq ft of 3/8 inch BR-111 engineered hardwood. I didn't have a single jam or misfire through about 12,500 staples. The only reason a didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of a manual to explain proper depth adjustment for different thickness of materials. It wasn't hard to figure out, but did take some experimentation. I am very pleased with my decision to purchase this tool."
4,Great stapler for Bruce Natural Reflections,"I purchased this gun to install Bruce Natural Reflections 5/16 hardwood. The gun worked like a champ. The only issue I had was the manual, or lack thereof."
1,Terrible film.,"This guy, that made his attempt at directing and writing obviously is about 5 years behind the rest of the pack when it comes to black cinema and the lack of funding for production and the lack of a theatrical release indicates this.Bad sound and camera work, simple story outline and all of the first time actors round out the cast that spend their only time tslking in a circle standing still begs one to turn the channel. Music is lame and the story is boring. We as black Americans must be truly starved for our own product if this is percieved as in any way shape or form as being a film."
3,"man, what a movie!","amour Infinity is one of the best independent black movies I've ever seen. ... I think Jerry Lamothe is one of the most talented newcomers in the game.... He shot this film on digital for next to nothing. I'm one of the many fans who can't wait to see his next movie next year called, ""From The Outside Looking In' starring Isiah Washington, Mos Def, Allen Payne and Terrence Howard. You go boy!"
3,"It's no Love Jones, but.....","This movie was not bad compared to the deluge of independent Black Movies that have recently flooded the market. The lead actor does an okay job (being this is his acting debut) but the lead female character was dry as the Mojave desert, she could use some work on her craft. The story line is a simple and familiar one, but a true story line which is why this one had a real message. There was no Hollywood love will conquer all ending as we see in most movies, and the man not only doesn't get the girl, but walks away from her in the end.... And that is real people, this is what usually happens in Love and War!!!"
3,Writer has a lot of potential,"Ok. First lets get the cons out of the way1. Low-Low budget film2. Characters/Actors did not move. They stood in one spot and delivered their lines.3. Cast consisted of first time actors (I hope.Now, once I got past the cons I continued to watch the film because:1. There was some great dialogue and2. I was intrigue about the protagonist's dilemma.I think that the film's writer has great potential. I think if the film had a bigger budget then the film would have been WAY better. There would have been better direction, better acting, etc.But all-in-all I enjoyed this movie. This was the first B-movie that I have EVER enjoyed."
4,Snappy!,"A hard to find item that requires a bit of skill to play. You can get the hang of them in about 4 weeks,mastering them a bit longer."
1,Not worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read this book and was very disappointed. For the price, it gives all the same information that every other stripper book out there does. For the price you can buy 5 other books by dancers, who wrote thier own books, and be much happier with your purchase. Not worth the money... And couldn't the author come up with her own title, Stripped, is already used..."
1,"Not all that, rather Disappointing!!!!!",As a dancer I found this book to be very disappointing and does not show the real side of dancers. There are many other books out there that paint a real picture from real dancers.Maybe the Author should go and shake it herself and then she would get the real perspective about the job. I loved the job and enjoyed it very much. Not all stripper's hate the job and want out cause they can't handle it. I wished I was younger so I could stay in the business a lot longer.Check out my reviews to see what books about stripping are the best....
4,Really hits home the generational aspects of marketing,"It's not often a significant marketing book is published. I've often recommended that marketers read selectively in business history and management, because books that claim to help marketers (such as Faith Popcorn's) seldom deliver the goods. This new book is easy to follow and the distinction between boomers, matures, x-ers is argued quite well. It matters little whether Ted Bundy is an x-er icon or Mel Torme is a matures icon. These points are fun to dispute. But the point aptly driven home is that some of the most significant differences in consumer marketing today are generational."
3,I'm highly suspicious,"I'm pretty suspicious of the review from the the reader in Harrisburg, PA. It just sounds too much like promotional speak from the Walker Smith and Clurman Public Relations company.As for the book, I'm only just thinking of reading it. I'll use my local library to find a copy, however."
5,Great fun!,It reminds me of the music my parents listened to or sang when I was growing up. Brings back great memories.
3,"There are better CDS out there, that speak to our culture","Okay, this CD is an acceptible compilation of Italian American music. But it is BORING.Above all, it really doesn't speak to the SOUL. We came across a fabuous CD, The Italian Wedding, by Roman Holiday Music that offers a fresh and wonderful rendition of the most beloved songs sung at an Italian wedding. They performed the music LIVE, it is not a rehash of old Connie Francis songs, or whatever, and it truly makes you want to get up and dance. Anyway, just wanted to add my two cents as so many of these CDs are just re hashes of old songs from the 50s - 60s and it is a rip off for people buying them, when they can get them at that local library for free."
1,"Oldie, Moldie Italian Songs","I ordered this CD, thinking it would satisfy the tastes of my Italian American family when I FINALLY got married a few months ago. Well, when I heard it, I was truly disappointed. . .it was just a compilation of oldie moldie Italian songs, with the standard arrangements, and no one in my family really liked it. We ended up with the Italian wedding CD by a band named Roman holiday (which I ordered via amazon.com) My goodness, it was like NIGHT and DAY. . .what lively songs, what passionate arrangements. THAT CD made my wedding, and I can't stop talking about it. Thanks. Auguri!"
1,"Viva Italia, excellent","The CD was used as part of an Italia Fiesta we organised in Albury NSW, Australia. The music helped in setting the party atmosphere for the evening. The evening was held as fund raiser for the Murray Valley Sactuary Refugee Group. The evening was very successful."
1,God Save us!,"Even the title is wrong at least should be ""Viva L'Italia!"". Is this a best seller of Italians songs? This is not representative of the Italian music. Some good songs yes, but many from southern Italy in a language that also is NOT ITALIAN: is the southern Italian dialect."
3,Viva Italia!,"I expected the singer to sing in Italiani, Italian not half English and Half Italian. Dissapointed If I wanted an American CD I would of ordered one."
1,no smaples to sample before purchase gets you a lemon!,"i was looking for singers SINGING classic italian songs, which this cd is not. i would love to return it. it's terrible, it's a rip off, OK?"
4,Love the Music,This is a great CD. The songs put you in an italian resturant. Ilove playing this while I cook dinner.
5,Italian Classics CD offers great selections!,This is a fantastic CD offering a variety of Italy's best music! I purchased the CD to play during an Italian Dinner Party and was so impressed with the selections and variety! It offers a little bit of everything and is perfect for entertaining!
5,Great Background Music for Dinner,I bought this CD to play as background music for a church fund raising dinner with an italian theme. It was perfect for this purpose!
5,Great CD!,I love the Viva Italia CD! I ordered it for an Italian Mystery Dinner that I hosted and the background music was perfect!
4,gradpartymom,"Great CD - perfect for background music for our Italian themed party. Lots of songs, with the majority sounding like you are in an Italian restaurant. Highly recommend!"
3,fun songs,"italian majors would appreciate this album. lots of fun songs that i've been trying to find. some, unfortunately, are just instrumentals. they're still good listens so i'm overall satisfied."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"The last thing I want to do is read some dissident's views. Activists generally don't like America and / or find fault with it. The author clearly falls into this camp. He speaks about a CIA that used-to-be for the protection of our liberty. The fact that this book got published is evidence of a new leftist-leaning agency. Sure, harassment exists today, but it is directed at patriots who couldn't get their real life stories of harassment published. I know because I am a target of it."
3,Good for a Laugh,"I purchased this CD because I wanted to bring back some childhood memories however the selection of films isn't in the Stooge classic list I would have made. The only real chuckles come from ""Malice in the Palace"". This one is an example of Stooges at the top of their game. Still, I think it is worthy of a look if you like to collect pocket videos as I do."
2,Fine if you have nothing more important to do,"When I bought this, I thought that it would be a good thing to have to help pass the time if I was ever bored. But I soon realized that if I had the time to load it onto my Pocket PC, I could be doing something useful. I'd recommend getting something you can watch on your regular computer instead."
5,GREAT,LOVE IT FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS EVERYTHING HARLEY. EASY TO CARRY AROUND AND PLENTY OF SPACE FOR THE DISC.
1,Not the original artists!,"Be careful! This is a CD with a lot of great dance tunes, but they are NOT performed by the original artists. The artists do a decent job, but you know what you're getting."
5,Excellent book to begin with for understanding Einstein,"Though some of the German-to-English translation is a little stiff, this book provides an excellent overview of the man and his science."
2,whoa!,way to much information. it was good and all but it had too much info and was a slow read. i didn't liek it too much. too much info!
2,More a referance than a readable biography.,"I found this book very exasperating indeed. While it may be a good referance work, the non-specialist would find it very difficult to read full tilt like a novel. While detail can be a strength, in this book it overwhelms the reader: the writer simply MUST cite every letter Einstein wrote and every reply he received! It is a tedious exercise. The science is dry, clinical and extremely difficult to follow. The writing (translation?) is mediocre and the editing is even worse. Forget this book if you are looking for a passionate, clear, focused and above all a readable account of Einstein's life and thought. There must be better biographies around."
4,An interesting and detailed book.,"I felt that this was a first rate reference guide, but as a novel it was lacking in readability. The science and history aspect was outstanding but because of the way it was written and the layout it was difficult to follow at times despite its accuracy. Another problem was that there was too much detail and some chapters seemed to perpetually drag on. Even though it got monotonus at times I learned much about Einstein as a person and his accomplishments other than the famous ones such as relativity and light quanta principiles. All in all despite some problems it was an informative and facinating book and I enjoyed reading it."
5,Excellent Resource,I find this book very helpful in the research of herbal studies. I am a student and appreciate the work that has gone into a book of this type making it much easier to find the pertinent information on the herb that I am researching. I can see that I will continue to get a lot of good use from this book.
3,no color photos,I tried very hard to make sure I was purchasing a version of this book with full color photos...sadly this one is black and white...arghh!
1,"bats, bats, bats","This is an obvious attack on rats. If you notice the funding for the book, it's from big exterminator companies who want to make people fear rats. Rats get a bad rap, they're blamed for starting the plague (it was actually fleas), are thought of as dirty, repugnant, hoarding creatures and are hunted for their fur. I'm no big fan of rats but I met a guy in Russia who loved and studied them (unfortunately he was bitten by a rabid one and died of fever later). He taught me that rats are just animals in the diverse natural world. He lived with thousands of them and they were very lovable. Of course he wasn't the best smelling guy. He even gave me an albino rat, who later was crushed in my bag when it was mishandled on the train.Books like this are not doing rats any favors so please keep an open mind and a big piece of cheese for them."

2,Overratted.,"I picked up this book thinking it would be an elegant blend of science, history and philisophical musings a la Lewis Thomas--but Barnett has failed utterly. He shifts from psuedo-philisophical ponderings to sounding as though he's lecturing to a bunch of college freshman. I can't possibly give it a one star because I did find a lot of the information interesting, but on the whole, I put down the book rather dissatisfied."
2,This isn't the best book for rabbit breeders in the U.S.,"I have this book, and although the author does a fair job in describing the care of a rabbit, she simply has things left out that should be included.The listings of breeds (and show terminology) are from the UK, and would confuse readers in the US. Same for the listing of plants (which I think she went overboard on this area.)There IS a decent section on genetics, however it isn't as accurate or current as I would prefer.Read it at the library, but don't waste your money on it if you want serious information."
4,On Par With Holden's Balance Album,"This is another good album by James Holden. Once again one disc is slightly stronger than the other, and once again this all falls down to track selection. Generally speaking though, Holden has a much better grapse on what works as a set of tracks from the realm of minimalist house and electro-tech when compared to the slew of DJ's that have jumped on the mimimalist bandwagon over the last couple of years. It doesn't hurt that his studio mixing skills are way better than most also.There are some stellar tracks on disc 2 which are mostly frontloaded to the first 20-30 minutes of the set. This album had the potential to be great, but there are too many screecher tracks (for my tastes) on both discs that interupt the flow and groove of the set. Some people like this, but I liken the music (if you can call it that) of these tracks to the sound of bad feedback from an amp. Sounds just like rough noise to me.Disc 1 get 3.5/5 stars and disc 2, 4/5 stars"
1,To sleep!,"the only thing this album can do to me is put me to sleep. I do not know what in theworld was James thinking when he mixed this album. Not great, not pleasent, not good at all!"
1,Clear Word Bible,I was veery dissapointed The print was much smaller than you posted on line. This is the first thing thing that I have bought from Amazon that I have not been pleased.
5,Wow I can Read the Bible without THE/Thoued to death,This is not the King James version of the Bible but even my nephew (16) has read in it and enjoyed it. Very easily read and very close if not better the the King James interpretation. Reads like a book not a code... Love it!!!
3,Print is too small,I like the fact that this Bible is as stated...clearly written and easy to understand. However the print is too small for most adult eyes.
2,Not what I expected.,"It’s not the content that I don’t like, it’s the size. I was under the impression that I was ordering a “full” sized Bible, not a pocket sized one. Especially for the price, I was sadly disappointed. After reading through the description twice, I did not see where it mentioned the dimensions of the Bible I was ordering. For those reading this, you are getting a Bible roughly the size of the palm of your hand."
3,It was a gift,"If was a gift so I really couldn't rate it, however the recipient was very pleased to receive it..Thank you"
1,The Clear Lie,"Revelation 22:18,19 offers a very strong warning deliniating the destiny of people who do what Jack Blanco has done in this volume.This so-called Bible is not the Word of God in a simple and clear form, but rather it is the injection of Adventism's cultic doctrines into the biblical text. Often substituting a plagiarizing false prophet's words for the clear statements of Scripture which expose her heresies for the ""cunningly devised fables"" that they are.If you value truth, integrity and purity; do not purchase this volume. If you prefer the comfort of familiar delusions, then this book is for you...."
4,Simplified Truth,"This Bible paraphrase is a wonderful devotional tool. The author indicates in the preface that this paraphrase should not be utilized as a study Bible. However, a student of the Bible will discover that this paraphrase is scripturally sound. Particularly helpful is the guide (in the back) on reading the Bible in chronological order. It is especially inspiring to read the Psalms as they correlate to the numerous stories of David. Again, it is definitely an inspirational devotional tool that will bring new life to the Bible."
3,I love this paraphrased Bible. I hate the fact that THIS IS THE HANDBOOK EDITION AND THEY DON'T CLEARLY SAY ON THE FRONT!!!,"It's deceptive that they do not say that it is the handbook edition. We were expecting the full sized edition. I suppose we will have to find someone to give this edition to, but I do feel cheated. The HANDBOOK edition should be as clearly displayed as the HARDBACK edition is... it's deceptive otherwise. Beware buyers. Know what you're getting.EDIT:My wife and I ended up using this Bible and it is very nice. It's just small. Please be aware of that before you buy it. You may well need glasses to read this little Bible."
1,A Shame,"It is wrong to call this a Bible. It is one mans opinion of what the Bible says. Sad to say some people think that this book reflects the mind set of the Adventist church, it does not. Those that are true to the Adventist doctrines would never presume to publish this book. So much that this man imagined while in his ""meditation"" was put into this book. Please don't judge the SDA church by this one mans fake bible. The Received Text from which the KJV comes from is the real Bible. This is not an Adventist bible. I would not waste my money on this."
4,"The Clear Word, Pocket Edition.","I love the book, I use it as a reference to the bible to get a more clear understanding, book was in great condition too."
1,EXTREME CAUTION !!!!,A very bad translation. It is a deliberate mistranslation by the Seventh Day Adventists to promote their personal doctrine about Saturday Sabbath keeping. Check out http://www.sdaoutreach.org/clearwordbible.cfmfor some examples of it's distortions.
1,This Is Not A Bible,"This book is improperly named a Bible. What it is in fact is a paraphrase of the Bible with the peculiar doctrines of the nineteenth century false prophet, Ellen G. White, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church inextricably interwoven into the text. This makes it virtually impossible for the reader to truly know what the original writer of the passage really wrote. Often, key passages have their meaning completly changed to match the strange doctrines of this group. Avoid this book! If one is really interested in finding a Bible in easy to understand modern English, try the New Living Translation of the Bible or The Bible in Basic English or The Living Bible Paraphrase.Note: Unfortunately, I was not allowed to give this heresy 0 stars"
1,"Adventist, not Biblical","This was written so that the tortorous (and incorrect) inferences that the Adventist so-called prophet Ellen White makes, appear to be ""Biblical."" Like the (real) Bible passage says ""red"", but she said ""blue"" in her writings, so the Clear Word Bible is CHANGED to read ""blue"".YOU CANNOT RELY ON IT. Just the opposite: it will deceive you.If you have a copy, throw it away."
1,Blaspheme,"This so called Bible should sit besides Jehovah's Witness and Mormon's rewritten works called the Bible. It totally and completely misrepresents many truths in the genuine word of God. If you are truly interested in the word of God and it's meaning, you will not find it here. As with other cultic books, this book is meant to persuade people into a cult religion where God saves NOT by the gospel of Jesus Christ described in 1 Corin 15:1-4, but by worshipping God only on the ""Sabbath"" and if you worship God on Sunday you will be rejected by God. That is only one of the many cultic doctrines of this religion this book ""teaches"" using the authority of God."
1,Look Out!,"The Clear Word bible is a heretical book put out by the Seventh-Day Adventist cult. Many passages are not translated correctly from the Greek, leading readers to beliefs that were not intended by the Bible. These incorrect translations are based on the false teachings of Ellen White, who among many other false teachings, predicted that people alive in 1856 would be at the second coming of Christ, that the Civil War was a sign of the End Times, that the Old Jerusalem would never be rebuilt (it has), that the USA would be defeated by England during the Civil War (it never even joined), and that slavery would return to the southern USA. Dueteronomy 18 says that one false prophecy means that the person is not speaking from God. For more info check out http://www.sdaoutreach.org and http://www.sda-egw.com/clear_word_bible.htm ."
5,Calculus isn't beyond the reach of the average kid!,"This is an outstanding book because it takes the mumbo-jumbo out of traditionally taught calculus and makes the ideas accessible to ANYONE, not just to math whizzes. The technical vocabulary and symbolic notation can always be learned later. This book introduces the important ideas of calculus with simple, natural language and, most helpful of all, illuminating graphics, so the beauty (yes, beauty) and fun of calculus comes through. I would recommend this book to anyone who is teaching children, and also to math phobics. (I am the former, and was the latter for many years.) This book is FUN, and it makes calculus FUN!"
2,This book is too small for the price,"Before you buy this book be aware that it measures [approximately] less than 3x5"". However, Donald Cohen has some great ideas. It is true that you can easily introduce younger students to the type of thinking that will be necessary in precalculus and up. I think it is worth it to get the workbook, which covers most of the material presented in this book. But don't buy both."
3,3 Stars for one of the TINIEST books I've ever owned!,"Yes, this book is very tiny, nearly requires a magnifying glass to read and I do agree with the previous reviewer that it isn't worth the price for the size of the book. BUT, my math-inclined son can easily hold it in his hands, so maybe there is a method to the madness. My husband, an engineer with a master's degree in mathematics, has been a bit skeptical about our son learning calculus at the age of 9, but I think this book will do what I expect, and that is to introduce basic concepts in calculus that I never got until my first year of college. I hope it works!"
2,One nice print,I was looking for a low priced 4 x 6 portable printer that I could take with me and have ability to leave sample pictures wherever I was visiting. My first chance to show it off was a recent family reunion. The first picture was very good and printed to edges as advertised. Of course several relatives now wanted copies. The next print was about 1/2 inch short on one edge. That was the last print because an error message to fix paper jam (none existed) kept coming up preventing any further prints. The printer was returned today.
5,One of my favorite books....,"This is my go-to book. I've loaned it out, lost it and bought it more than once. If you've never made liqueurs, this is the book for you. The authors include many noteworthy tips and set you up for sure success. I've tried over 10 recipes in the book and they've all been winners. And when you show up at a party with home-made liqueurs, the look on people's faces is just priceless!"
4,"Yes, get this book","Okay so you can probably get much of this on the Internet but really, its neat, its compact, informative and cheap = get it."
4,Good times,"I bought this book primarily to make Lemoncello but, I actually have a better way to make that. I did use it to make several other liqueurs that turned out great. I even bottle the stuff up and use it as Christmas presents...sweet!I'm generally not a hard drinker but thanks to this book and learning how to use Everclear in liqueur over Vodka we can really get toasted while enjoying our own bathtub brew. Everclear isn't really delicious but you won't remember that after a few rounds."
3,Interesting,"This book is interesting overall as historical fiction, although the ending is of course a foregone conclusion, very much in vein with all of the historical treatments of pre-communist Tibet and its border regions. The narrator, a self proclaimed ""idiot"" character who doesn't seem so stupid, is a hero that is rather detached and whose own visions of what he wants are unclear. I personally only related to him minimally."
3,Propoganda for the Communist take-over,"Although it's nearly subliminal, there is enough pro-Chinese Communist propoganda in this book to sully its otherwise rousing and unusual story. There are several asides, obviously put in by the author so that the Communist government will allow it to be published, that talk of how Tibet was ""always"" under the control of the Chinese, that it was never completely autonomous. I'm reading it to the end, but I won't read another book by this author because of this viewpoint."
1,Red Poppies,"I have not yet read the book but just going by the editorial reviews I got a strong feeling it is not a pro-Tibet book but rather written to destroy the view we in the West have about Tibet. The author may not be Chinese but he definitely must be forwarding their agenda. Readers beware not to let yourself be influenced by a piece of fiction no matter how well written it may be.This being said, I shall now buy the book but read it with caution and a large grain of salt. As fiction and not having anything to do with the real Tibet."
5,wonderful greatness,"this album is wonderful, honest and right there. take a listen to real talent..."
5,Review For Alibi Clock,"this album*s so awsome, A friend of mine recommended it to me, and now it won*t leave my cd player! A *MUST* for any fan of heart wrenching, true lyrics.Similar to that of Tori Amos, or Sarah Mclachlan."
3,This is too Commercial for Beck,"Beck is my favorite music artist by far. But, I bought this CD in haste, and it is just a remix of becks original songs. (It seems). Just a lot of studio over-dubs. I love Beck, but I think he kinda Sold-Out on this one. I do not recommend this CD. But, buy everything else by Beck."
2,Only a summary of Strauch's other Eldership book,"I'd read Strauch's other book on eldership (Biblical Eldership: An Urgent Call to Restore Biblical Church Leadership--a very useful exploration of the biblical material on the subject), so when I saw this book, I assumed it would offer additional material or approach the subject from a different angle. However, Biblical Eldership: Restoring the Eldership to Its Rightful Place in the Church is just a short pamphlet that summarizes Strauch's other book. It might be useful to introduce the topic to a church leader who doesn't have time/interest for the longer book, but if you're looking for substance rather than brevity, Strauch's other book is the one you want."
4,Eldership,"This booklet is a good concise overview of the importance of understanding what the Bible says about being an elder in your place of worship, as well as defining what an ""elder lead church"" means. A worthwhile and quick read."
2,Title didn't note this was a booklet. I wanted 10 books.,"When I searched for this book, the booklet came up. It never said it was a booklet. Now I am returning them and will have to pay $18.90 in shipping and a UPS fee. I still want the book, but am not confident to re-order from Amazon as I don't want to receive the booklets again."
5,great board,"this is my second board. just found out it was dual opteron, S1207, blah blah after i made ordered. but it is the ASUS KFN5-Q/SAS with quad opteron just like in pic. i wised they could of have more memory slots.onenetwork dot net4 - opteron 2.3 quad-core16 - 4gig memory = 64gig10 - hitachi 2tb raid 10. 8 raid 10 and 2 spare.2 - 1tb western digital raid 1. os hard drives.my other boards are supermicro H8QMI-2 and tyan n6650EX.these boards are bad boy toys"
3,"Product is okay, service was horrible",the product was definitely not what i expected. the photo shows two trays and i only got one. I paid $9 for one tray? that's absurd. i am very dissatisfied.the product is great but there's only one tray when the picture shows two. false advertising.
3,A bit misleading,"I am usually not one for complaining, but it surely looked to me as if two of these trays come in a package. I love the trays but they are a bit overpriced for just one."
5,Low Impact Roundhouse,My partner and I used this book as a guide when building our own roundhouse. We both had quite a lot of building experience but still found the book both useful and inspiring during our build.As a launching pad for your own ideas and plans this book is excellent.
2,Somnolence (yawn) unleashed!,"Lugubrious, soporific, inspiring slumber.....organic ambien. I loved Cupid and Psyche, Provision, and to a lesser extent Anhomie. God, where is the BEAT?? I know, I know, artists change. But still. Two stars for the incredible, as usual, production values."
4,The gems make it worth it,"As a music fan not particularly fond of Scritti, I found this album to have a lot of filler, specifically tracks 2 through 14. But Boom Boom Bap and Robin Hood are amazing songs.Keep in mind that I am rating this album 4 stars just for those songs. No matter who you are, or where you play them, they'll get a terrific response. Scritti fans, like my sister, will probably enjoy the rest of the CD a lot more than I did."
2,bitter dissapointment,"Unfortunately, I forked out $14 for this CD. Upon first listen I am extremely dissapointed. Being a huge fan of SP for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of Green's previous work. Also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist. Use this as Sunday background music on a rainy day; but do not expect to get the party started with this album...."
4,"Good Arrangements, TAB is Annoying","The Arrangements are idiomatic for guitar which is advantageous, and they stay true to the Beatles' original songs.As a classical guitarist, the TAB is more annoying than it is helpful, but that might just be me. A few pieces are trickier than others. Page turns are okay for shorter pieces, but not ideal for longer pieces (but that's always a problem on the guitar).I wish it had a couple of others, such as Come Together, Hello Goodbye, or Here Comes the Sun, but oh well."
3,Best Than Could Be Done,"I like The Beatles, always have, but their music is not really suited to solo classical guitar. To my ears it seems simple and overly repetitive when played that way. It doesn't do the music justice. The same goes for most pop music by the way. Listen to any decent recorded version ""Classical Gas"" with orchestra, then learn and play the solo version. The magic is lost. Sorry to be negative. I bought this songbook with high hopes."
1,"Colleccion de oro ""Centernario de Garcia Lorca","I have the same experience as W.H. Brown, I bought the CD thinking that the CD was a collection of Garcia Lorca poems, instead I got a CD with music that do not match the cover. I was very dissapointed. I like de music, but my intention was to buy the Garcia Lorca collection."
4,A different existence,Great book that makes you think about where you truly are in life. It is a must for all psychology minded people.
3,how to recruit,"Deals with the key tasks - to attract candidates with the necessary experience and qualifications. Contains topics on communication, factors in job-choice, recruitment agencies, writing for recruitment, media- choosing cost effectively, appealing to the youth, and recognising professionalism in personnel management among others."
5,Mike has done it...again !!!!,Mr. Kimera is my favorite writer of erotica. He uses sex..yes..but he also has substance to his work. I have enjoyed his stories on various sites....and surely enjoyed this one immensely. A great variety !!! Check out the Sex and Laughterbook he has a story in..and it is available on Amazon also.Treat yourself to Kimera!!!!!!!
3,"Compared to the other, this one wasn't that great.","There were parts that I loved. I love Jake and I think that Gaia and him make a good team, but I hate how she pulled a 360 and was afraid of everything. I admire her for her karate skills and bravery, but Pascal, I guess it was neat seeing how she could be normal. I will love this book a lot more if she turns back to being fearless. I love how Ed has grown, I hope either he will learn to live without her, or that he'll get back with her (perferably, without either one getting physically or mentally hurt). Overall, I love this series and don't see how i could live without it."
2,HIGHLY ANNOYING!,"Gaia just wasn't meant to feel fear! Why doesn't she see that? Throughout the whole of this book Gaia's a silly, timid and shy girl with no trace of the real her. She seems to have gone through a complete transformation by getting those unnecessary fear genes!! Even Jake's confused now about whether he likes Gaia like before or not! And Gaia can't beat the crap out of one single being on the streets in this book! Terror is definitely not for anyone who got hooked to the series for Gaia's toughness and fighting skills. In simple words, this book is not for any real Fearless fan at all. And if Gaia doesn't get back to being Fearless again somehow, the rest of the books in the series will be equally irritating. And sad."
5,None But The Brave,Excellent movie about World War II in the Pacific and how two opposing forces handled an uneasy truce during trying times.
5,No One Ever Wins,"Interesting view of soldiers on both sides of the war, brought together on a remote Pacific island, to live out a truce while awaiting rescue. Clint Walker gives another manly performance...what else could he do?"
2,Poor war flick--too much wasted foolish talk,Dont expect tons of action in this war of minds between a Jap Officer versus an American officer who's men must survive on the same island. Lots of bull talk some ridiculous.You have to play this in the hard of hearing sound mode to see the subtitles as to what the Japs say. Unfortunately these stay on when the Americans speak creating a distraction. All in all a mediocre picture at best.
3,None But The Brave,Old Blue Eyes produced this movie. Great anti war theme but not preachy and the Japanese are not portrayed as blood thirsty slant eyed devils. Good action but hokey airplane models used in the shoot down scene. Why didn't they caption the Japanese when they talked as the original cut did?I knew what they were saying as I saw it in the movie theatre. Frank's son in law Tommy Sands was great as the young shave tail Lt. Clint Walker tho not a great actor was good as the Captain leader. Bummer ending but that's war. Worth seeing!
5,None But The Brave,Again Frank Sinatra gives another fine performance (he has always been underrated as an actor in my opinion) and he even directed this film! This is an interesting W.W.II film set on an island in the Pacific where small bands of both American and Japanese forces are stranded. This film examines the human sacrifices made in war and questions if there is justification for those sacrifices examined through the camaraderie and reminisces of fellow combatants on both sides. I always liked this one. Listen for an early score composed by John (Johnny) Williams.
1,Don't buy this edition,"Great war flick, and the video/audio were very good, but there are no english subtitles for the japanese dialogue, without which you are stuck with the hard-of-hearing subtitles for the whole movie, including ( SINGING ), (LAUGHING ), etc., which to me is very annoying, or you miss a good part of the movie which is in Japanese. I can't believe this was overlooked in the production of this edition."
4,JJ72 kicks it off,"I've been listening to JJ72 for a while now, collecting their singles and continually being amazed by what these teen-age rockers can do. While the album doesn't offer much new for those who've heard their singles, it still sounds just as good as it always does, and now its all collected in one place. The songs are really unlike anything I've ever heard before. The lyrical style takes a little getting used to (it's done entirely in falsetto) but I quickly learned to love it, and makes for an interesting contrast with heavy over-drive guiatars and bass. If there's any one problem with JJ72, it might be that they need to work on the lyrics a little more - I'm sure they all looked good on paper, but some of them sound just a little bit absurd when sung out loud. Over all, though, the album is very good, and I heartily recommend it."
5,Choral Magnificat,"This is a complicated album that takes a lot of getting used to, but is well worth the effort. A strong, throbbing rock album with piercingly beautiful aspects, and some potentially classic songs, JJ72 is the work of a young Irish trio. The lead singer, Mark Greenay has the most fantastically spine-tingling voice, whose falsetto is powerful and moving. All emotions are evident on this album, which is amazingly well rounded for a debut. ""Oxygen"", ""Long Way South"", ""Snow"" and ""Algeria"", the singles, are stand out tracks, ""Snow"" being a great lament, quivering like a requiem, and ""Algeria"" being a powerful rock scorcher, that just pushes on and on. At first, it all sounds a little theatrical, but on repeated hearing, looses this, as its greater parts become evident. This is a wonderful album which will, in time, become a classic of its genre."
3,2.5 stars really,"This album is fairly straight forward and dull. They don't deserve the success they are having from this unimaginative album. To me it sounds like a cut down version of Sunny Day Real Estate's 'How It Feels To Be Something On'. Anyone who can empathise with this album would be better off delving into the the works of Sunny Day Real Estate. JJ72's debut initially sounds excellent and very emotionally powerful, but the fact is, after a few listens, you probably will leave it at the bottom of the pile of cds and forget about it. I would recommend this album to any depressed individuals with a short attention span."
2,Development Needed,"Yep - you can tell they are young. After listenting to the first couple tracks you can predict the rest of them. Slow song beginning, alternating falsetto, peak in a screech or guitar riff, and start over. The lyrics are a little too strained and forced. Give the young band members some time to develop. If they can break out of the predictibility pattern of their music and try some new approaches periodically they might be good."
4,from Westminster John Knox Press,"Prayer is one of the central activities of the Christian life. This anniversary edition of Karl Barth's lectures on the Lord's Prayer, along with supplementary essays by three Barth scholars, introduces readers to what he had to say about this important Christian practice. For Barth, the ultimate aim of all theology is worship, and here he mines the theological and spiritual wisdom of Luther, Calvin, and the Heidelberg Catechism urging us to participate in the work of God through prayer. Karl Barth was one of the major theologians of the twentieth century. He is remembered for his voluminous theological writings especially his Church Dogmatics. I. John Hesselink is Professor of Systematic Theology Emeritus at Western Theological Seminary, Holland, Michigan. Daniel L. Migliore is Charles Hodge Professor of Systematic Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary. Donald K. McKim is Academic and Reference Editor for Westminster John Knox Press."
4,"1st, 2nd, now the 3rd","""Hoppkorv"" represents the third album of a paticular sound-phase for Hot Tuna along with ""America's Choice"" and ""Yellow Fever"". Not to say it's just more of same, far from it, but Hot Tuna will quickly switch back and forth from an acoustic-one-minute to heavy/electric the next. Both are great. It's just going to depend on which fan you talk to as to which is the more preferred. MY favorite is ""America's Choice"" but I cannot qualify that at all except to say it just seems to hit me just a little bit more than the others do. Bottom-line: I like this album....a lot!"
4,Good Electric Tuna.,"Ignore the covers on this album, this is pretty good electric tuna. North Wind Rise in not the only gem here, plenty of good rockers. It is sort of an odd album for Tuna, one suspects the need to fulfill a contract obligation, nevertheless, good backbeat blues."
2,Frustrating,"This book, though containing some useful strategies, is riddled with errors, and contradictions. After taking a test and reviewing answers, some explanations basically say ""these four answers are wrong for these reasons and it's obvious that the last is correct."" Having a tremendous amount of formal logic in my background, I can tell you in many cases they are WRONG. I have the seond edition and you'll notice, for example, in the explanation for quesiton 10 on page 99 there is a blatant contradiction between the explanation for answer B and for answer D. B states Cartier-Bension is NOT confrontational (and is the basis for their answer), where D states his relationship WAS confrontational! Huh? Did they proofread??!!The furstration endured with this book is severe and the questions seem harder (and more vauge) than on any other REAL LSAT I've seen. If anything, practicing on harder questions will make LSAT day a snap.The strategies are this book's only saving grace."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Although this book seems to be organized well and offer good tips for the LSAT, the fact that some of the problems do not have correct answers is infuriating. Not only are some of the logic problems so poorly written that there is no correct answer, the solutions to these questions must blatantly ignore the rules of the problem or ""solve"" them incorrectly to arrive at any answer. (In one problem that asks you to select the answer that cannot exist, the solution finds that four of the answers are rule violations (and therefore not permissible within the context of the problem) and then picks the last one as the correct answer. Even then, one of the answers they pegged as a rule violation wasn't.) Don't waste your time trying to puzzle it out."
3,Received today with a dent in the bottom,"It feels like a fairly sturdy metal bowl, but it came with a dent in the bottom.For $10.99 and 4-3 savings offer, I will keep it as is, instead of sending it back at Amazon expense and have it replaced. Not worth the environmental cost of more packing stuff and box."
4,Very Good Battery,Took charge in acceptable amount of time. Holds charge very well. Would buy another if needed. Have had for about one month.
2,so i'm a whimp,"you're better off waiting(?) for goldenstar (released in germany in '96/'97), now there's a five star recording, still good in '99. Goldenstar is a collaborative effort from some notorious pyrotechnists who systematically destroy the whimp. this is erotica."
4,this is very typical doowop collection of relic-label.,"not every song a gem,still it`s fun to hear and so it`s a must for the real doowop-fan"
2,Could Have Been Much Better,"It's too bad these songs from the late 1940s are in such sad shape. While the liner notes list Bill Lacey for 'Audio Restoration', the sound quality is still pretty poor.The songs seem to be culled from singles and various film selections.Jane Harvey and Amanda Lane pick up the vocals on a few of the songs, with Desi carrying the weight on others. 11 pages of liner notes and biography are included in this current packaging.If you are looking for the Desi Arnaz excitement from his performances on the 'I Love Lucy' show of the later 1950s, this collection will leave you disappointed. While the seeds of his genius are here, Desi Arnaz, like Xavier Cugat in the same time period, only got better after these earlier recordings.He certainly deserves better than this collection gives."
3,Babalu--esta asi asi,"'Babalu' is cute; not a very serious album. I bought it expecting a representation of Desi Arnaz's music. I do not think this is so. I was entertained, but not awed."
5,"Hip, musical fun for kids and grown-ups","Few kids or parents will be able to sit still while listening to the toe-tapping energy that drives this lively collection of rock songs for today's kids. The lyrics are relevant to the lives of modern children, including a song about the Pokemon craze (""The Fever""), while much of the humor (and there's a lot of it) is timeless. I especially like the funny ""Knock Knock"" which features kids' voices and a bluesy harmonica in the background. This is more than just silly kids' stuff, though. The instrumental ""Got Milk"" is a quiet, beautiful piece and ""Thank the Farmer"" is a thoughtful homage to those who grow our food. The inclusion of ""Best Friend"" (from the TV show ""Courtship of Eddie's Father"") is a sweet inspiration. This is a wonderful musical treat for the whole family."
5,"Way cool music for way cool kids, AND their 'rents!","My Grandkid loves Daddy-A-Go-Go. So do I! Eeek!, July 7, 2000Reviewer: Chris Curle from Marco Island, FloridaI gave my grandkids Cool Songs for Cool Kids and Monkey In The Middle andhad to get two more for me for my car. John Boydston sneaks in all the funstuff from the music I grew up with and delivers it to yet anothergeneration with good ol' rock n' roll rhythym and style. Love it!s"
1,"Sadly, a Waste of Money","While this game may be good on other gaming consoles, I do not recommend it for the GBA for anyone of any age. The total time it takes to play the game is less than 2 hours. There are no side quests, there are no special features, and the story is nothing but a super condensed version of the movie. It's repetative and a complete let down once you finish the game. Somehow, I really thought I would get more than 2 hours of gameplay for spending $30."
5,BOOK BETTER THEN MOVIES,"I had seen both versions of the movie Scarface and enjoyed them, but I always felt something had been left out or wasn't just quite right. Having read the book, I wish someone would remake the movie and follow the book, not the script that was written from it. Perhaps the studios or writers didn't want to make Tony a character people would like, perhaps they didn't want people to think of Al Capone as having any redeeming features. All I know is that I couldn't put this book down, when I finished it I read it again. If you are a fan of the movies, please read the book. Yes, the character of Tony's sister is in the book, but there is not a hint of Tony having 'a thing' for her and he has a brother who is a policeman."
3,OK review of the field,"The book covered pretty extensively what's going on in the field of cluster analysis. It's a good reference book, but not the best in terms of teaching me the logic underlying various decisions in cluster analysis."
4,Old might still be gold,"I own acopy of the second edition of presumably the same book published in 1980. But its author is Brian Everitt alone and it has 132 pages. Obviously, the current edition discusses the more recent developments in Clustering Analysis and it has two more co-authors. So I might miss on newer definitions, but I have to say that the author's explanation of the then available methods in the old edition is of excellent quality."
2,Less Practical and more academia,"Rich information, but really hard to read. It's more suitable for academia than it's for practical. YOu will have to have rich stat background to understand everything on this book. Great for Master's and PHD students who are still workin on their programs."
3,Regular Crossover,It is a regular crossover to enjoy the car sound. This is to get a medium sound car. is not very good.
5,Not just for Carnivores!,"I am a vegetarian and I use this grill press all the time. It's great for grilled sandwiches! It will help you make great stuffed french toast. Your hashbrowns won't be a sloppy, crumbly mess anymore. This heavy little bugger is perfect for the aforementioned applications and about 40,000 more but the thing I use it for on almost a daily basis is preparing tofu. That magical bean curd benefits tremendously from the steady pressure of a hot lodge grill press!"
3,Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Grill Press,"A well made product. My only gripe is the petite size. As one person pointed out, this is my error for not doing my homework. However, my interest was in purchasing the large cast-iron grill, the press was offered when I made my selection and just from looking at the photos, it appeared to be more appropriately sized for the grill I was purchasing. Again, it was my error for not confirming the size before agreeing to the added purchase. If I had checked, I would not have purchased the press. It's good for one person and that is not the way we cook."
4,"Great quality, smaller than similar grill presses but good value","Very good quality and heavy, only 6.5"" long"
3,Should have looked at the measurements...,"I should have looked at the specs prior to purchasing this. I could have bought an already-assembled product for the same $.Despite its small size, it is very useful for individual burgers or a panini."
3,Some assembly required,"I bought this bacon press because I love Lodge's pre-seasoned cast iron cookware and the fact it's made in the USA is a bonus. This press, however, was a beast to assemble. I'm 6'1"", 280lbs (too much bacon perhaps) and I had a devil of a time getting the lock nuts screwed down tight enough to keep the handle from rattling around. Yes it does do the job, but it's under-sized and after dealing with putting it together, I would suggest the larger one piece Camp Chef 9 1/4"" X 5 3/4"" I bought locally (Amazon also sells it). It has grill marks and a good weight to it for sandwiches, bacon or larger cuts of meat. I'm still a Lodge fan, but I would not suggest buying this press."
5,Works great,Easy to assemble and works great with the cast iron product that I bought. Great for getting bacon and other meats cooked!
5,""" Best bacon and sandwich press ""","I use this press at home & camping . The guys like thick bacon , on our fishing trips in the high Sierra's . With the press the bacon stays flat , I don't have to stay and watch it ! This will last a life time ! I had ordered are USED PRESS and once again Amazon.com sent me a BRAND NEW one , thanks Amazon ! 100% - best service !!!"
5,Perfect!!,Just what i was looking for! Strong and sturdy. Highly recommend it! Now I can make healthy sandwiches without using those toxic non stick electric panini makers!
5,Cast iron press,"This is actually the second one that I purchased since I enjoyed cooking with the first one I had. I wanted to be able to cook more food using it. It works great, just make sure to oil it before and after use, to keep it in good shape."
4,If You Like Evenly-Cooked Meats,"I have only used this once, but I like what it does.It keeps meats from curling up from the pan and helps cook the meat evenly.No more salmonella poisoning for me!!"
2,Read dimensions and reviews; this press is very small !,"It is a straight forward design and I'll give credit as they are honest and tell you it's 6-3/4 by 4-1/2 inches. Unfortunately it is too small to be very useful and I feel the product was designed to be the cheapest size and not the best size. Bacon is longer than press and it's not wide enough to fit 4 slices easily. I wish I had spent more $ and got a larger one. It felt like a toy when I assembled it and my wife and daughter laughed out loaud when they saw what I bought. Note even a sandwich bread is wider than 4 inches so I should have been more careful. I only gave it a 2 rating because they list the size, in reality I would say avoid this unless you specialize in cooking small food."
5,Works extremely well,I actually purchased this for my brother because he saw the one I purchase for myself and he immediately wanted one.
1,Huge Disappointment,"I ordered two of their grill presses that measure 6-3/4 x 4-1/2 inches, along with the Lodge Logic 10-1/2 x 10-1/2 cast iron skillet. First off the grill presses don't come with the stainless steel handle depicted, but rather some sort of painted black metal handle. As for the skillet, the interior (cooking surface) dimensions are only 8-1/2 x 8-1/2 inches, which is a full two inches short of what was advertised. Therefore the two grill presses I was going to combine (6-3/4 x 9 inches) for pressing bacon don't fit onto the skillet, so now I have to deal with returning the whole mess."
2,Assembling,I usually hate assembling things and even though this was easy - it was annoying.....and with the nuts & bolts protruding underneath - it prevents it from laying flat on the sandwich. Annoying.
3,Lodge Logic grill press,"A quality Lodge product, well made for many years of use. It's main draw back is its size and weight. It is ok for straight grill work but if you want to grill a sandwich it is not really heavy or large enough for the job."
3,Flat Bacon,Not a whole lot to say except that it works. One problem is that the handle cap screws are to long and the handle is loose. Still works.
3,"Works well, but is kind of small.","I really didn't look at the dimensions of this before i bought it, but it seems kind of small. If you're using this for bacon or burgers, plan on cooking one persons' portion at a time, or buy more than one. Besides its' size, it is otherwise an excellent cooking tool. Bacon comes out much flatter!"
5,Awesome,"Works great. I have a matched pair of these, and one about 3 or 4 times its size - they work great on chicken and burgers. I use them on steaks, but still finding the right groove there for timing.This cooks chicken about twice as fast it seems - keeps the juices in too - and carmelizes any marinade added to it. Basically adds flavor and reduces cooking time. Whats not to like?I keep this on the grill as the grill warms up, slide it over, add chicken - drop the press on top. I wouldn't recommend grilling without these...."
5,holds the bacon,"Fine product, just like all the other Lodge things. Wish it were just an inch or so bigger on the short side to give more coverage in a 10 inch skillet.Ah well."
3,Cast-Iron Grill Press,"I was really satisfied with the speed of delivery of my item from Amazon. However, the press, which I love, I thought it would have been somewhat bigger than what it was. I'm sure I will get many years of enjoyment out of this item. I love cast iron products and have several pieces."
2,Handle is flimsy,"Assembly of the handle is required. Neither my husband or I can get the handle on securely - it rocks and jiggles. I think the screws are simply too long. It works for now, but I don't expect it to last. When it fails, I'll replace it with one that is made of one piece. It's too heavy to be worth shipping back. As a press itself, it's fine."
2,Did not like,In this case if a person has to put something like this together - I did not think it would last. I prefer the one piece Presses. I have 3 boys (now teens) but I have to proof everything! LOL
2,Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Rectangular Cast-Iron Grill Press,"Much smaller than I expected. I should have asked for measurements. A very nice, well made item but just too small for bacon or anythng else I can think of."
1,way to small,"I orderd this with the pro grill,which is a realy nice unit. unfortunatly they made this item the grill press appear much larger siting beside the pro grill. It's aprox. 7.7 by 4.5 inches, enough to cover ONE hamburger or 4 HALF slices of bacon. I have a pyrox round glass that covers much much better. In my opinion the way they posted this item and not making it's size readily observaable is dishonest,not worth the price."
4,Work's OK but it's a little small,This would have better if it was bigger. It's big enough to cover a sandwich but certainly not bacon. The handle gets to hot to handle often. Still glad I have it tho.
3,Good for the Grill,"I bought 2 of these for my husband to use as panini presses on the grill/smoker. They do work well for individual sandwiches. However,be warned that the ""stay cool"" spiral wire handle does not stay cool! He has to use a pot holder to lift the presses from the sandwiches."
1,If you want to smell like a head shop...,"I always loved the smell of Madonna's album Like a Prayer. Decided to Google it and see what I would find - Patchouli came up, so I ordered this perfume. When I received it I dabbed a little on and my boss walks out of his office and says - What is that, it smells like a head shop in here!Need I say more. I stronly suggest that you pass on this one... unless you like to smell like you pass something else."
3,Teranova Patchouli Perfume Essence,"Aroma is VERY intense, I'm going to mix it with another essential oil for a more subtle sensation! Extremely powerful."
1,smell,The smell is too strong. I won't were that as a perfum. Maybe a drop in a pot pourri pot for a room fragrance would be acceptable but even then that would be too expensive.
3,Over powering,"A little over powering when first putting on, then faded to nothing. I was not happy with it, however I love patchouli."
5,perfect transaction and the book in great condition,This is a favorite book of a friend from his childhood. He had not seen or heard of it in years. He was so happy to see it and cherishes it. He is 67 so you can imagine how long it had been. Many thanks...
2,"Insulation good product, shouldn't be shipped by amazon",This product does insulate well. I got my first set at a big box home improvement chain and these worked well. Got a second set from Amazon looking to save money. Problem was that the packaging was non supportive of this long product and one of the 2 sets were bent. Could not get the bend out with the supplies and knowlege that I possess. To get the product out of the packaging I had to destroy the packaging. It became too expensive and time consumming to send the item back and so I ate the cost. This is a product that should be bought in person and not shipped. At least not by amazon.
5,yes it is a propaganda book and therefore valuable,"the previous reviewer does not understand how valuable it this book for its use for historical research on Japan. Kawakami wrote Japanese propaganda material in the United States and in this sense alone his books are quite useful. this is not a modern-day book of history, but a first source for historical research."
1,Japanese pre-WWII propaganda piece,I briefly read parts of this book while writing a report on the puppet gov't of Manchoukuo. This book is a pre-WWII Japanese propaganda text meant to justify its invasion and occupation of Chinese Manchuria. Its statistics and facts are laughable.
2,More of a Philosophy...,"The author constructs this book around the premise that the success of the revolution was secured by the luck of the Americans and a lack of commitment by the British to total victory. His premise makes for a refreshing new approach to the conflict. However, the author supports his premise with so many opinionated statements (preceded by the words ""may have"" and ""could have"") placed next to unfootnoted factual statements, that this book presents more of a philosophy than a theory."
2,Love QB but 2006 has been nothing butheadaches,"Love QB but 2006 has been nothing butheadaches, March 9, 2006Reviewer: T. Krisher (southeast) - See all my reviewsMy company has been using QuickBooks for at least 5 years and up until the 2006 release has only really had problems when we upgraded for about a day getting the file converted. We loved QB and it has worked well for us. Until 2006. This software has been one bug, glitch, or problem after another. Many of the customer/vendor search options are gone. But mostly there are so many bugs. Every time we sign in we are always told we have paychecks to send, EVERY TIME-even when we don't which is 90% of the time. Our friendly reminders (i.e. Don't forget your W-2s) never go away, even when we say it is done. We can not create an accountants copy from our computers anymore- now it is only from the server. There have been more problems but these are just what I have been dealing with this week. Qb is a great program but 2006 sucks!!!"
5,Vacation in Subterranea,"I happened to be at the concert this was recorded from. Let me just say it was an increadable show and, although not nessisarily my type of music, this band and especially this CD is haunting. A year later I find myself still thinking of it. If you like VAST you'll like these guys."
3,A Decent Harp,"This is a very serviceable harp. I would have rated it much higher before I bought a Bushman Delta Frost harp. Now, however, the bar has been inextricably raised."
2,Very mild (bland) and a little hard,"I was hoping it would be softer but it's pretty hard to chew. There isn't much flavor at all. In fact, I can get more flavor with any licorice at the supermarket. I've bought many types of organic and specialty licorice and this was the blandest I've ever had...hardly any flavor at all. For the price I won't be repurchasing. Disappointed."
3,Licorice bites,Tastes like regular licorice. Packages are small and have to buy 12 so not the best value. Would like to see larger packages. It is good licorice.
3,Not for first time speakers,"With no background in Vietnamese, outside of a few lines from Full Metal Jacket, I would not recomend this CD. It is too dificult to pick up with only one play of the phrase. I prefer other language CD's that re-play every phrase twice."
1,A Preacher---Not A Christian Stand-up,"I was looking for a Christian stand-up comedian act and this is NOT. I was disappointed in this DVD. I feel I was misled by him being labeled/catagorized as a ""comedian."" This implied to me he was a stand-up Christian act. Ken Davis is a preacher, preaching a SERMON on this DVD and while he is certainly talented at illustrating this sermon with a few comedic illustrations, it is still a SERMON and NOT a stand-up comedic act. So don't be fooled about what you're getting. Know his stuff is amusing preaching, but still preaching just the same. Don't buy it if that's not what you're looking for."
5,The Essential Eddy Arnold,"Anybody who loves the smooth sincere way Eddy Arnold approaches a song, will likely love ""The Essential Eddy Arnold."" This CD samples some of Eddy's earlier music as well as his later recordings. For me, he gets better with age, and his later recordings are very beautiful and sung with meaning. ""You Don't Miss A Thing"" especially speaks to the heart of anyone who has lost their first love. Nobody sings a song with the tenderness of Eddy Arnold. This CD should please any Eddy Arnold fan."
4,Eddy Arnold Songs,"I have enjoyed Eddy Arnolds recordings for a long time and I find these to be very good,most of these recordings I have had before on old 78 records."
3,Astronomy for Amateurs,The book is interesting and helped me understand many things about early astronomy which were confusing to me. I'm sure the printed version has the visual ads and star charts which make it easier to follow. Even without the star charts the book in enlighting and informative for the beginning amateur.
2,Not what I was expecting,"For a book that can be found in the science section this book reads like a poem. I was expecting to be able to use this book to identify constellations, as well as learn fun facts about the planets. Unfortunately it provides a 2nd grade understanding of astronomy that sounds like it was written by an English lit major."
3,"Good, but highly technical","I'm really enjoying this book. It is full of exactly the kind of information I was seeking. It operates on the assumption that you have a general understanding, but know little of Astronomy specifically. That being said, it is full of jargon and highly technical caluclations. I'm guessing those will get easier to understand as the book goes forward, but perhaps not. I recommend this book, but I recommend boning up on your math first."
1,Astronomy text with illustrations missing!,None of the illustrations made it into the Kindle book version. The book is useless with them. I wonder if anyone looks at books like these when they are translated into Kindle format.
2,Poorly Written,The title is really pretty silly. This book is not amateur level by any stretch of the imagination. It's more like ready an Astronomy Encyclopedia.
1,A disappointment,"Star charts are missing, rendering this classic french astronomer's book worthless. I have removed it from my Kindle, even though it was free."
4,un poco de amor,This cD has a couple of good songs listen to some of the samples like the 2nd song and youll see what im talking about. If i had to buy it again i would. enjoy the cd
1,Avoid,"we tried this item as well as the Discovery Item and both have the same flaws...very difficult to use. Me Mum-in-law is an expert, and she says have them start on a real machine...I should have listened. My 6 year old wants to learn to sew clothes for her dolls, as well as become a quilter. I was really hoping that this unit would have the safety features that allow for a child----and it does, but it is so difficult to operate for an adult, that there is no way the child will figure it out. Threading is very difficult, even for small adult hands, so I simply don't see how a child will be able to operate this. Better to listen to Me Mum in Law, a wonderful and talented woman; a Master of Crafts. Use a smaller adult machine and use caution and oversight. Besides, your daughter will love the one on one interaction with a precious Mom, Grammie, or Auntie! (As a dad, I just don't cut it in this area!)"
5,singer Child's sewing machine,"Great starter machine. Had some trouble threading it the first time, but it works really well and is very safe for young ones to learn on."
1,Impossible to thread,"I bought this machine to teach my 6-year-old grandaughter to sew. As another reviewer commented, it is impossible to thread the needle. The needle does not rise up high enough for you to be able to slip a thread, or the needle threader, through the eye. It was great fun sewing until we wanted to change the color of thread and discovered we could not thread the needle! I am going to try and get some satisfaction from the manufacturer as this is clearly a design problem. Whoever 'designed' this machine, never used it!"
1,Would be great if it worked,"Maybe you will have better luck then we did. Our machine did not work. We even took it to someone who repairs small electronics and they said that it is not repairable. So we are returning it. I liked the idea of the slower speed and shild safe foot guard. But this bobbin casing is loose and does not allow it to sew, it just jams up. Very frustrating."
1,cheap junk,"Very thin walled cheap steel will bend if you weigh over 200 lbs and ride over any kind of rough terrain, not worth the time. Some BMX shops have the same configuration at much better quality but those are harder to find."
3,little misleading,"The top part is 13/16"" but after the bulge for the saddle its 7/8"". I had to make a shim out of a pop can to fit it into the bike frame."
2,they sound cheap,"c note didn't do very well with ""wait till i get home"". they sung too high on that song and it didn't sound as if they did their best. i'm going to give them another chance though, because i heard some of their other songs on mtv's ultra sound. I suggest that they sing lower, because this song sucks!"
1,I don't think it deserves one star either!!!!!,"I REALLY REALLY REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS BOY BAND. THEY ARE AWFUL AT SINGING,IF YOU HAVE TO LIKE A BOYBAND, GO FOR BSB!!!! NSYNC IS SO ANNOYING. WELL, I AGREE WITH THE ""MUSIC FAN"""
1,This doesn't deserve 1 star!!!,I have had it with boy bands....I like NSYNC and they're the only great band around...Now C Note. Sure they have a great website...but they are not good at singing. They are put together. Just another way to make money. I'm sick of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Someone needs to stop this madness!
5,"Great Album, Hard to Get any Better...","From beginning to end, one after the other, you'll listen to a great voice singing great songs. In Rosana's sound, you can hear lots of Spain: guitars, melody, rhythm, romance, energy.All tracks are built for tireless listening; my highlights are- ""El Talisman"", irresistible Gipsy power- ""No se' manana"", the sad end of a romance- ""Lunas Rotas"", also romantic and soft- ""Sin miedo"", fast blending of Pop and Flamenco- ""Descubriendote"", ultimately romantic.In 1996, Rosana took a soft, traditional Spanish sounds and tool it to new heights; after that, she slightly changed her formula and until today she could not repeat herself.A ""no-skip"" album, I've listened to it dozens of times. By the way, you'll appreciate it even if you do not speak Spanish, as melodies speak loud, universal volumes."
5,I can't get enough of this CD,"I got on to Rosana from amazon.com's tips on who else had bought Enrique or Shakira, or maybe both. I'd never heard of her but decided to give it a try. As so many other reviewers have said, ""Si tú no estás aquí"" was the song that first grabbed me and I wanted to listen to it constantly, but now I've moved on to ""No sé mañana"". Does she ever convey the pain of discovery in this song. She has such a great abiblity to transmit feeling through her music that I've given copies of this to friends who know no Spanish, and they, too, fall in love with it. I'm just about to buy my 6th, I think, copy to give to a Spanish friend now living in the States to give her a taste of her homeland."
5,Great Album,"My wife and I were introduced to Rosana's music while on our honeymoon in Spain.We bought it on the recommendation from one of the employees at a music store (when they still existed).Rosana's voice is beautiful and full of passion. Its easy to play for any crowd.This album mixes a number of styles (pop, flamenco, mariachi,salsa, ballads,etc)You will love it.Here other album Luna Nueva is wonderful too!L"
4,Como una rosa,"Rosana canta con corazón y belleza. Hasta ahora (junio del 2000), Lunas Rotas es su mejor trabajo. Vale la pena escucharla, refrescarse con su voz joven, sorprenderse con sus juegos de palabras, recibir su intuición de mujer."
2,Didn't receive the item picture.,This item was not plaid but camouflage and it is much smaller than what is pictured. I have a medium size and he barely fits on it.
3,Flatten Quickly,These pillow flatten very quickly and I have found that stuffing two of them in a cover makes them more comfortable for the dogs. I would not use these for my dog's primary sleeping pillows. They are used on the porch for when they are outside and are fine for that purpose.
2,Not that great...but what do you expect for that price!,"Well I bought two of these for my large dogs, after all the picture shows a lab on it. They were much smaller than the picture and the fabric was very thin and ripped the first week I had them! My dogs only fit half way on them and they were torn up by getting on and off. not a great product, I will pay more next time for better quality!"
1,Not Plaid at all. Two beds: pale yellow and light blue,"My dachshunds will eat these under stuffed pillows soon. The material is flimsy. ""Beds"" were cheap but they are the size of pillows and they are not plaid -- they are striped. If I had seen them in person I would not have purchased them at all -- even at this low price. As it is, I'll let my dogs have there way with them rather than go through the hassle of the return. The colors are ugly and pale. Each one is large enough for one dachshund. I say invest in the Yap bed. My dogs LOVED them, but the younger pup chewed a whole through hers; it took her a long time to do it though, because YAP uses a canvas like material.Multipet Yap Dog Bed, Retro Square, Measures 22 Inches for Small Dogs"
1,NOT GOOD!,IT SUCKED! It took almost 3 weeks to get here and when it did it was the wrong one! then i did get the rite one there was no bag on the inside so i couldnt wash it and it wasnt very durible it was gone in a day! literaly! 35$ I DONT THINK SO!
2,TOO SLIPPERY,"The size and comfort of the dog bed is acceptable. The cover is attractive, however, the fabric is very slippery. I was walking across the room and didn't quite step over the whole thing. I went flying! Could be dangerous unless the bed is somewhere in the home where no one could step on it."
1,For the Dogs,"3 of the 4 beds I bought were OK. The fabric on the 4th was thin and was ripped the 1st day. I ended up making covers for all of them. The price was low, but so was the quality."
3,Would not buy again-OK for money,"I did not receive the plaid color indicated in the picture. The bed is smaller than it appears. It says this is for a 60 pound dog, and I don't agree with that. It is more like a king size bed pillow. It may be good for smaller dogs. It does smell good and my dog does enjoy it, but she doesn't fit on it."
4,Highly Recommend!,"I bought two of these for my older Doberman. They are a wee bit on the small side for her, but she does fit on them and that's a good thing. These beds are better than ones I've paid $100 for. Would definitely recommend!"
2,unhappy dog,"I bought this bed only because it looked really large.My dog is old and had a broken hip so I wanted to get her a bed with a lot of padding. Well it was too small. It looked like a large pillow from my bed well she hated it. I tried to have her lay on it for 2 weeks but no luck. She was just to big for it. I eventually took the ""large pillow"" and stuffed it in her old bed. She still doesn't lay on it. It was a waste of money. I ended up giving her old flat bed back to her."
1,20 minutes until...,"Wood chips and stuffing everywhere. I know it was cheap, but if you have a smart dog: forget this item. Worthless. Figured out the zipper in minutes, destroyed in moments later."
1,"DO NOT BUY,THIS IS NOT AS ADVERTISED IN PHOTO","Do not buy this product if you own a large dog. The photo shows a large dog on the bed but the actual product is half that size. My dogs could possibly use it for a pillow just for their heads. I felt really tricked,duped and cheated when I opened the box. And I purchased two of them."
4,Nice bed for the price,"I read all the reviews and they were all so good I purchased two. My dogs like them and it makes them smell like cedar, which is fine. The material is polyester so it's cold and slippery.It will be great in the summer but for now I put a blanket over top of it.I was just expecting a cotton cover, but it's all good. They're happy so I'm happy."
1,This Bed sucks (SMALL),I don't know why this bed pops up when you search for large or extra large dog bed because this bed is not even suitable for a 20 lb dog. I couldn't imagine even a chihuahua thinking that bed is comfortable. Its just not suitable for any dog.
2,Wag Bag Plaid Dog Bed poor quality,The Wag Bag Plaid Dog Bed would be good for a gentle dog with no nails. Day 1 (or 2 maybe) the bed ripped. I contacted the seller and received no response. Won't buy from them again based on customer service alone. I expected some sort of acknowledgement.
3,Misleading Photo:,"If the dog weighs under 40lbs., this could be a *decent* bed for your precious canine. Let's face it, I didn't expect much at this price tag.Positives: It smells good and came with a nice design.Negatives: Smaller than advertised and does not have adequate padding for a medium to large dog.That being said, everyone lulled-in by the price tag should know that this picture is quite misleading, as well. The dog looks like a labrador retriever (the same breed as my dog), but is obviously not. The shipping is equally ridiculous for an item that weighs as much as the box its shipped in.I did keep the bed, however...for myself! For the price, it makes a great pillow to prop up while watching T.V., surfing the NET, or writing reviews on Amazon.com."
2,Minimal filling,The product had minimal fiberfill and no more than a small handful of chips. Had an overpowering perfume smell (not cedar) Had to wash it right away as it gave me a headache. I will re-stuff it myself and see how it goes.
2,Nothing More Than A Big Pillowcase,"I ordered 4 of these beds for my dogs for Christmas. In less than two days, these 4 year old dogs had torn 3 of the beds open. Then they tore the zipper out of two of them. If you are looking for a tough bed for your dog, these are not the ones."
2,Too Tiny,"The bed is much smaller than it appears in the picture.. Too tiny for our German Shepherd / Husky to lay on (yet somehow a chocolate lab can fit on it comfortably?), but she uses it as a pillow. Save yourself the $$ and just get a pillow from Target."
1,Cover changed,"I gave an earlier rave review, a few years ago, but the company changed the cover, to a slick material that also poofs up and makes it hard for the pets to lie on it. They avoid it. I notified the company, and hope they will return to the former covers, but until then, who needs a bed the pets won't lie on?"
1,This listing is inaccurate.,"Not sure if this is a problem on Amazon's end, or if Northern Tool screwed up, but the item I received is a 21x30 cushion, not the 27x36 model described (and pictured). I have a small lab, and she can basically use this a pillow for her head. Also, the cover is quite thin, and won't last long enough to make this purchase worthwhile."
2,My Pooch Doesn't Like It.,"Basically, this is a glorified pillow. It's really too puffy to be appealing to lye down on, and my Border Collie isn't interested in it at all.I have other doggie beds that she is very happy with, but not this one. Fortunately it's inexpensive, so it's not a big deal.My advice....spend a little more and buy a better bed."
5,Updated photo - accurate,"I bought two for the price, you cannot beat it, the fill is firm and the cover is canvas like material that doesn't hold hair like cloth/fleece. She loves to chew and after several weeks she hasn't even attempted to claw or chew these ""Pillows"". Imagine a King size pillow just a little wider. They are light weight provide my dog great support and repel dirt and hair, oh and they are cheap. So do like I did, get two, either way, great for the crate at the very least.One Comments complaint about this product review section is that allot of the complaints have to do with color or pattern. The product description clearly states that you may not receive the pattern shown and even lists it as ""Various Patterns"". I ended up with a blue plaid and a green cammo. So, if you can throw caution to the wind and close your fashion ""eye"" cash in on this deal.UPDATE: My dog did wear these out but nothing you buy for pets is forever. I have since bought a bed for 20 from Costco."
1,Dreadful quality,"I bought dog beds from Northern Tool a few years ago, was happy with the quality so I went ahead and ordered two of these. Don't be fooled by the photo of the large dog laying comfortably on its bed - the new ones are completely different to the one shown (which is more like the beds I had before).The cover is made of really cheap, thin, man-made material; there is a zip but no inner cover so it can't be washed (when it is unzipped, you just get a look at the cheap stuffing).I phoned the company and went through the return authorization process only to find that it would cost me nearly as much to return the beds as it did to buy them.I have decided to make outer covers from decent material and then donate the beds to an animal rescue group as cat beds (I don't think they would last very long with a dog). I will be looking elsewhere for dog beds from now on."
3,dog bed,"This item was shipped in a timely manner, however it was a camo bed instead of plaid which i actually like the camo better. The bed looks much larger on the website. I have 40 pound greyhound mix and she actually likes it because she likes to curl up into a ball. Overall it is a good product for the price, despite the misconception of the photo."
5,Wprth the money!,I bought 2 of these for my dogs. They both really enjoy them and I had to wash one already and it came out really well. This is a great product at a great price!
4,Good Bed...Bad Dog,The bed was a good product. My dog on the otherhand tore it to pieces. I guess she just wants to lay on the hard ground and be cold.
2,Not as depicted,"This is not a large bed. The picture shows a large bed with a large dog, a chocolate labrador. In reality its a medium size bed for a medium size dog about the size of a cocker spaniel."
1,"I had high hopes,","I had high hopes for this bed. I assumed for the price, it wouldn't last for a very long time, but since my puppy is still growing, I was only really hoping for a few months use before getting her a ""big girl bed"". This one lasted all of 2 hours. For the first 1.5 hours, my 5 month old boxer mix loved it, slept on it right away. Then I left her for about 30 minutes and returned to find she had the zipper chewed off and stuffing ripped out and the bed completely ruined. If your dog is NOT a chewer, this may work for you because she did find it very comfy, but for dogs that are chewers, don't waste your money. :("
1,boring antebellum congressional political trivia,"look, its not really that book about the transition to capitalism in America you wanted to read, its boring schlock about congressional political trivia in the National Era. Go read Dobbs, and when you get to be senior faculty fire this man. 500 pages too long"
3,"Good book, BUT...","This is an important contribution to American early 19th century economic-social-political history, arguing that modern capitalism's formation during the 1815-1846 time period represented a fundamental and decisive break from the past. While filled with excellent details in a variety of avenues, Sellers' main weakness is that he underestimates capitalism's influences in earlier times and, second, he associates EVERYTHING under the sun with the capitalist revolution even when he has to pound the proverbial square peg into the round hole.His writing style is often verbose, and if I had a dollar for every time he uses the word ""antinomian,"" I could take a month-long vacation to Jamaica....first class.Overall a useful book, but there are better, more useful ones out there, like John Larson's ""Market Revolution in America."""
3,Important for the Scholar,"This is one of the most important works on U.S. history before 1865 out there. BUT, it is very long and very tough reading. Put simply, if you are not extremely interested in economic history, you'll quit reading this book after 50 pages, so don't waste your money. The book contains important ideas, but they are not clearly conveyed. I recommend this book for grad. students in history (who probably will be forced to read it), but that's about it."
2,Come on people lighten up! I's not THAT bad!,"This movie had very good acting and a decent storyline, so why did people think it was so bad? The ending of course!What were they thinking? But, i mean come on, give them a break! I guess they tried there best! Anywayz this is still a pretty good horror movie to watch w/ your friends when your bored, its better than ""The haunting"" i'll tell you that much!"
2,Normally...,"Normally, I like horror movies, but this one was horrible. It could've been a terrific movie, but the writers/producers/director decided to make it center around gore. They forgot that it should've had great content instead of having things that make a person sick watching the movie. The acting could've been better. Everyone looked like they'd barely learned their lines. The best performance was done by the guy who played the priest. This movie could've been so much better!"
2,He Who Snoozes Behind The Rows,A ginky oddity of a horror movie that has a lovely blossoming interlude for romance between the two lead characters amidst the equally blossoming bloody theme of parricide. The plot has something to do with teenagers falling under the evil spell of He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Along with the dreadful symbols of cornstalks and gleaming scythes is a repellant scene of a churchgoer getting the voodoo doll treatment by some sly young highschooler undoubtedly belonging to the cult of He Who Snoozes Behind The Rows.
2,Should Have Ended Here,"Just like every direct to dvd sequel, there had to come more and more of this series. The acting was decent, the killing were decent (except for when the woman gets her face burned and the kid looks at her laughing mercifully, that was corny). Charlize Theron appears for like 2 minutes (gets killed somehow similar to Evil Dead in that she gets tangled with vines and the monster sticks his branch down her....you know where). The movie is lame, has some moments of goodness but still...after this sequel the rest of the series really is a wash and total waste of time, it started here."
2,awful junk,"I can't believe anyone would think about putting the third Children of the Corn movie on the same level as the original and part 2. Come on, the original was the best, and the second one was really good as well. Part 3 contains cheap, ugly-looking production that doesn't have any scare factor whatsoever. The corn field is inside the city, for crying out loud. How scary can that be?At least the fourth movie was a bit of an improvement. I would strongly recommend looking into the first two Children of the Corn movies before spending money on this low budget film. That's just my opinion though, and usually I'm wrong."
3,pretty cool,"i liked this movie because of the gore and because it wasnt too boring.why is everybody saying stuff about the ending.there was hardly an ending at all,this movie's so cheap.this movie is actually kind of fun to watch.the kid,Eli,is very annoying.i would have given this five stars if it weren't for him.that's how i can see why everybody hates this film"
2,REALLY bad.,"This movie is horrid. The acting is terrible, the plot holes are big enough to shoot 50 sequels through, and it has almost no relation to parts II or I. The only redeeming feature is the carnage-it's very graphic, creative in some ways, and well done."
2,"A crappy movie, to date","This movie held truth in it then the rest of them and some people says that its better then the first. Its an 80's movie people! It was bound to look poor, but this movie is another matter. The gore scenes were alright, but once again the people who made the series screwed up. They are so into killing in all of these sequals that they never acually have the chance to make it better. Another King classic shutting down, thats what. But lets go back to the movie. What the hell happened at the end? And that POTATO was He Who Walks Behind The Rows? Damn it to hell! The one chance of a good COTC movie and all of us beg for one, RIGHT? But no. I'm sorry, but it will never happen and I think it never will. The movie didn't work for me at all."
1,This movie sucks,Adopted brothers move to Chicago to live with a foster family and the young preacher turns the children against their parents. This movie is the lamest of the sequels to date. There was only one part that was good. And the finale completely ruined whatever chance this had to be a watchable movie. BOO!
4,pretty likable,I liked this movie because it was pretty scary. I liked the ending. The dvd dosnt have much features though.
4,The Last Good One (Until Maybe 6),"First of all, one person said this was direct-to-video. It wasn't. This was the last COTC to be released in theaters. It was also, in my opinion, the last good one, until maybe 6. After this, IV just made no sense at all, and Ezeekial totally annoyed me in V. Eli was a good leader, in the grand tradition of Isaac and Micah(my absolute fave) before him. I liked the whole ""urban harvest"" thing, too. I was loving this movie until the end, when they broke out the *stupidest* thing ever. When Eli turns into that worm, this movie's stock rating just plummetted for me. Without a big budget for effects it looked like the goofiest, cheesiest thing ever(think Evil Dead but serious about it). See it if you liked the first 2, and have a great laugh at the cheesy death scenes."
2,Perfect for teachers,"Okay - so you got your duct tape. Now what? If you're one of the many that don't understand chemical or biological terrorism, chances are that you're over-reacting over the threat. Tom Strother offers a common-sense approach for those non-technical people that want to take preventive actions at home or at one's place of business. He has developed this guide to explain the terms that police, firefighters, and the military might use in a response situation, the threats that you might face, and simple measures to be prepared. This book can be read by nearly everyone without ""dumbing down"" the serious nature of the threat, and, unlike other books for the public on this issue, Strother does not merely repeat what is in military manuals. If you're a teacher, you owe it to your students to both educate them on the facts behind chem-bio terrorism and to have a plan in the event that you are faced with responding to a chem-bio terrorist incident."
2,big disappoinment!,"i was really excited about this book bc it was written by a studio owner. however, she gives no real advice from her own experiences. in addition, you would be much better off reading books on starting a small biz and marketing than what this had to offer. look at the references page...there is nothing, it is only one page. this isn't a real ""work-book"" either, this is way beneath a ""dummies guide"" it is more like for a 5th grader doing a project. like i said, i had such high hopes for this book but it really fell short. it gives no real advice on setting up shop and marketing yourself. good luck all my pilatista's ;)"
3,"Very Bombay focused, a little disjointed","My expectations were high after having read 'The Picador Book of Cricket', edited by Guha. However, the book suffers from too much emphasis on the pentangular and then loses its way without an evident theme uniting the various topics. Guha's research is first-class of course and deserves a lot of credit for rediscovering the story of Balu Palwankar. For a book that frequently appears in lists of the best cricket books, it is a tad disappointing."
5,"Perfect, sharp, loving, funny","Twain was such a genius and these diaries are a perfect example. His insight into the differences between men and women is razor sharp, even now at the turn of the millenium. His portrayal of these two people is both loving and funny--he will move you so tenderly that you'll cry and then you'll find yourself laughing out loud. There are so many wonderful lines in this set, but here is my favorite. At the end, Adam says of Eve, ""Wheresoever she went, there was Eden."""
4,used CDs,"Arrived on time, discs were clean. Only the broken corners of the covers show they have been used."
5,Very funny & fast read!,"Great for a lazy afternoon; Twain's view of the first female's experience is funny and believable! He makes Adam and Eve seem like the couple down the street, with the same-yet-unique trials and tribulations and quirks we all experience. Twain based Adam loosely on his own admitted ""lazy"" personality; women will love it, and men may begrudgingly admit that Twain's probably right on."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed reading this book and was glad that I had purchased it, until I started reading ""The Bible According to Mark Twain,"" whereupon I discovered that ""The Diaries of Adam and Eve"" was abridged - overly so, in my opinion. That being said, the book is still an interesting read, but I think the better buy is ""The Bible According to Mark Twain"" and if you buy the latter, there is no need to buy ""The Diaries...."""
5,The Diaries of Adam and Eve,This an hysterical piece of writing by Mark Twain. His imaginative monologues of Adam and Eve are just the ticket to tickle your funny bone.
4,Hilarious,"Only buy if you want to own it, which I did because it is a fun read. If you are just looking to read it, I recommend getting it from your local library because it doesn't take that long to read. Twain is brilliant in his protrayal of women as ignorant to men's feelings but disturbed when they don't get any attention. Definitely a laugh out loud kind of book."
3,3 Stars,"Your products are excellent but,you need to speed up your delivery time. I just canceled an order from Sept. 14th because the merchandise that I wanted was taking to long to get to you for delivery to me. It was a product that I was really looking forward tp. I was very dissapointed but because of the amount of time it was taking for me to get the product, I had no choice but to cance."
4,fun feet,This game was fun while it lasted. My son got boried with it after a short period of time and has not played it since.
5,Good game for younger kids,It was good game. Grandkids love it. Shipped timely. Good service. Would recomond it to anyone. Very satisfied withthe service.
2,Sucks,My boys twin 6 year olds 7 year old and 9 year old don't like it. The songs suck its not like the movie. Movie was great and the game is I think the worst game I ever bought them.
1,"Poor Product, damaged, broken unglued spine, Falling apart.","This book was not in ""Excellent Condition"" as stated. It was not even usable. The spine was unglued and the pages were falling out. I love the cookbook, but this one was not usable."
1,The only extreme evil here is on the part of the author,Bob larson stupes to a new low exploiting the deaths of teenagers in an attempt to sell books. Clearly the man doesn't care if his ideas are accurate or not. It's sad that he doesn't really care about those he exploits.
1,does not work,I contacted the seller told him charger overheated.they told me to return.Also was told I must have installed my batteries wrong.the batteries are installed right the charger I have for my other scooterworks on this one just fine.I just didnt want to share charger with other scooter.It too is a 24 volt 500 watt scooter..cost of return and to ship new one back to me more than new charger.so I will just take the loss..mike wallace.
4,"great, but had some issues","i was out looking for a new charger for my scooter, when i fell upon this item. so i checked it out, and it was about $40. pretty expensive. i ignored that, but bought it. when i received it....2 DAYS LATER, i tested it... it didn't work. so i was very confused and upset. so i left it there till about the evening. when i checked it again. still. not working. the next day i had to go to a trip. so, when i got back, it wasn't working still. so i kicked it, and it worked. ??. but this item was reliable at times, but the connection was loose. so it had issues. but the issues were solved, and it was an amazing product. hope i helped. :)"

1,Every can was damaged - what are they trying to pull,"Our dog loves this dog food. But, after my experience with ordering this product online through Amazon the dog may not get it again, as I am not only upset with Amazon for allowing it, but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site. I ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can. And because of the location of the dents, on the inside cans, in the packaging, you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping. These cans we packed that way. Never again will I order anything like this online. It has actually soured me on using Amazon."
5,Wellness is top quality,My puppy was having some tummy upsets. Wellness products were recommended and my dog is healthy and happy. This is really a top quality product.
5,Excellent wet food for puppy,I'm very careful about what I feed my puppy and this food was highly recommended by our vet. It's one of the few holistic and natural wet dog foods on the market that is readily available in most pet stores. We mix it with Orijens puppy food and our pug-zhu mix absolutely loves it. The price is very good on Amazon too.
3,"Solid Music, Needs a little work","I really enjoyed the CD. It is a nice CD to have on at work, safe so you won't get fired for the lyrics but hard enough to make you feel alive.After listening to the CD, I'll be keeping an eye on the band over the next couple of years. They sound similar to a lot of the acts out there, so a break or two and they could be a major headline act.I only had two complaints about the CD. At times the music over took the lead singer and make it hard to feel into the song. Another was that the beat of a couple of songs just didn't feel right. Neither were enough to stop me from listening, though.The cover art is amazing. Nice to see someone pay some attention to cover art, a dying art for CDs."
4,S*P*Y*S,"Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould, the stars of M*A*S*H, were featured again in a very funny spoof about the cold war espionage days. This one is well worth viewing for sheer laughs."
3,NOT NEARLY AS BAD as its reputed to be!,"S*P*Y*S is by no means a great movie, but it does have its moments. Simply put, this movie is a cross between ""I Spy"" (the TV show) and the Three Stooges. If you like manic, cheerily violent slapstick-y humor like the Stooges (as I do), or that of the Avalon/Funicello beach party movies, you might well like this. All others, beware! (Hey, it's funnier than that ""Get Smart"" movie w/ Steve Carell!)"
2,"gould and sutherland can't charm this lifeless ""comedy "" alive","the only thing this ""spoof"" has going for it is the reteaming of mr.gould and mr. sutherland and their charm isn't enough to carry this silly try at a cold war spoof. the way the title is spelled out you just know they were hopeing that it would get people to watch, that should tell you what they thought of it. one star for each actor,because both are better than this."
5,THIS IS SORT OF FUNNY,"IF YOU LIKE MURDER AND MAYHEM AND DONALD SUTHERLAND.THEN,I SUGEST THIS MOVIE. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT IS A COMIC FARCE YOU'LL NEVER FORGET{IF YOU WATCH IT OVER AND OVER}."
3,"Nice bag, but does NOT take Dell 15.4 Inspiron 6000","I ordered this based on the fact that the leather bag I have been carrying is just too heavy, and there were some reviews stating that this would fit a 15.4 inch screen laptop. While the bag is very light and compact and well made for the price, there is NO WAY you'd get a Dell Inspiron 6000 with a 15.4 inch screen in this, no matter how much Vaseline you use. Maybe one of the kids will think it's a cool bookbag."
4,"A little small for 15"" laptops","It's a very tight fit for 15"" laptops - maybe I measured wrong?But I have Dell 6000 Inspiron and it barely fit, almost had to force it into the bag. But otherwise, it's a great bag with lots of storage for spare battery, power supply, pens, notepads, etc.."
3,works but wish it was bigger,"I really like the design of the shoulder strap to help balance the case and it makes your sholder less sore over time. I think I should have gone with a larger bag though because it is somewhat of a tight fit. This case is light weight and fairly well padded but a little small for my 14"" screen laptop. I have to use the pouch behind the sleeve area for my laptop computer otherwise it doesn't fit. But I don't think this will be an issue for a lot of people though."
4,"Great case; very tight fit for 15"" laptops","I love this case overall; it is of excellent quality and the price of around twenty-five bucks is a steal. If you have a laptop with a 15"" screen, it is a very tight fit. I have a Dell Latitude D830; the total width of this laptop when closed is exactly 14 3/16"" - it just barely fits in the padded compartment inside this Targus case, but it does fit - the tiny bit of extra effort needed to get it in this tight-fittin pocket is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 starts.If you ride a motorcycle and need a good laptop bag you can sling over your back whie riding, this is the one!"
3,"it does not fit 15"" dell","the 15.4"" dell i have do not go into its pocket, so m carrying it in the main pocket/. otherwise the bag is very useful,looks good and durable."
4,Good product,"This product is sturdy and has plenty of storage space. It is a little snug for my MacBook Pro, although they said it would fit.."
5,Targus CVR400 15 CityLite Notebook Case,Fabulous notebook case. Couldn't ask for anything better. It has everything you could need and quality workmanship!
5,Its worth for that Price,I have purchased this item for New Dell XPSM140.I do not want to spend more money on a laptop case and got this one for a very reasonable price.This item is serving my purpose and my laptop if perfectly secure within the case.It has good looks and i recommend this for all those who are budget conscious.
5,This is a great bag! Highly recommended.,I have 15.4' notebook that fits perfectly in the bag. The thing that impressed me the most is the design. The bag is SOooo stylish! One of my friends bought a similar one from Nordstroms for $200. The bag is also light and has multiple compartments. It's really a steal.
4,Notebook case,"Really nice notebook case, enough space for a lot of things including laptop's extras and magazines."
4,"Good quality bag, shoulder straps seem a bit cheap","I've been using Targus bags for years. My last one was the 17"" CityGear bag which i've had since 2007 for my 17"" macbook pro. As I recently purchased a 15"" MBP, the 17"" was just too big!! I landed on the CityLite 15"" and I have to say that i'm pleased with it. I has enough space for the laptop, charger, mouse, iPad (in an otterbox defender case, which is impressive!), and other 'ditties' that I carry around with me. The quality of the bag is pretty good, but i am concerned about how long the shoulder loops will last. I have a lot of stuff in the bag and the last thing I need is for them to break."
5,Holds up very well!,It's cheaper online than at Fry's. The bag holds up very well with lots of compartments for storage. Very durable and I haven't had issues with this product yet. Also a perfect size for air-traveling. I'm amazed at how much stuff actually can fit in this bag.
2,Snooze is right,"This CD put me right to sleep, except for the annoying vocals, which woke me long enough to push the stop button. Pretty uneventful, I kept waiting for something to happen that did'nt. A so-so think twicer."
2,Fun in Small Doses,"AFI's debut album is a great deal different from their last few CDs. There is no traces of Goth or pop punk here, just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics. The problem with this album is it's all the same, there's almost no variation, so it's good when you listen to just a few tracks (all of which are good) but put back to back it's impossible to get through the entire CD without a headache. The two standout tracks for me are ""High School Football Hero"" and the Classic ""I Want a Mohawk but My Mom Won't Let Me Get One"".The music reminds me alot of MxPx's debut CD ""Pokinatcha"", but the lyrics are alot more similar to the Offspring. Definitely a good CD if you wanna see where the band started and you're already a fan, but if you're new to AFI and want to backtrack from Sing the Sorrow or Decemberunderground I recomend either Black Sails in the Sunset or the All Hallows EP instead."
4,Good album!,"This is not an album a recent addition to the AFI fan base will apreciate. In other words, pre Psudo Goth Emo Davey. Sing the Sorrow providing an exelent example of what selling out will do for you. This album is awesome, a solid production of pounding 2 and a half minute East Bay Punk anthems. And none of the whiny slowed down gothic BS that some of us have come to except as AFI."
4,more like 4.25 stars,"this is one of my favorite AFI albums.this is back in the day,all the way back to AFI's first album and you can tell the difference just by reading the lyrics. songs like ""i wanna mohawk(but mom won't let me get one)"" show the younger subjects AFI is singing about. most songs are fast with rebellious lyrics, like ""don't make me ill."" the song ""highschool football hero"" will be very popular,with lyrics like ""i wanna score a touchdown so i can score after the game."" im sure many jock-haters will enjoy that one. they were pretty young, but they can still put out a agressive punk record that will make any punk fan happy. i find i can listen to it multiple times and still enjoy it. i would give it a 5 except not all songs are impressive. but very good for a debut and don't worry they get better.best songs: yurf rendenmein, the checkered demon, kung-fu devil, your name here, don't make me ill, open your eyes, and highschool football hero."
3,Not SO Bad,"Don't listen to all those die hard old school hardcore AFI fans. Er...unless you are one. But the point is, I love AFI, but this album is very juvenile compared to others. I wouldn't buy it if i were you...i say skip everything pre-Jade. So go directly to Black Sails, do not pass go, do not collect Answer that..., Very Proud Of Ya, or Shut your mouth...that's my advice to you. take it or leave it."
4,Should have started my AFI-listening here.......,"Yes, I heard one of the last records by AFI before this one, must say I did get a wrong impression. If they sold out and when they did it is questions I don't really care about, I just stop listen then. I grew up with blink 182, bought Enema of the State when it came, I was eleven or twelve years old. I got tired of them and their popmusic and went back in age and listened to some of their first records. Now I have kind of a ""hardcore"" taste, mostly I listen to hardcore, but I still listen to more underground skate-and-pop-punk like NOFX, some Fat-bands etc. This reminds me of that kind of music, only with a much weenier singer. It's more of a 3,5 star record, but I put higher grades generally. If you want NOFX alike music, this or the other two first AFI CD's is good examples. The others sound to experimental, and with their singer, it has to be hard to make good music."
2,"Well, it did cure my insomnia","The heroine is kind, practical, and pretty boring, really. Just about any other character that cares to walk onto the page outshines the hero. To tell the truth the romance between Lillis's jilted intended and Alexander's jilted intended was far more interesting. Too bad it only gets about 12 pages. I wonder why the author named the brothers Willem and Alex Baldwin. At least she didn't name the rest of the family Daniel and Stephen."
3,Lousy Hero,"Not unreadable.But the hero is a jerk. Really.Read Beguiled instead. Or better yet, the Coming Home Place."
5,A Hundred Years From Now,"More great music from the King. You may think you have heard all of his music, but you'll be surprised with this collection."
5,Elvis like you've never heard!,"It's unlikely you've heard some of these rare, second/third take recordings before. These subtlely different recordings are a real treat! Also represented here is the seldom featured ""Nashville"" sound that Elvis so enjoyed."
4,"Stripped Down ""Patch It Up""","I really enjoyed the ""stripped down"" nature of this CD, which gives the songs a looser, less slick feel than the versions that were eventually released. Elvis is in a fun, playful mood and the humor shines through in the outtakes. The best track, in my opinion, is this release's version of Patch It Up. Without the excess horns, backing vocals, and studio ""polish,"" this version grabs the listener."
3,Average,The item did not look as nice when I received it as it does online. Next time I'll go to a a store to purchase an item like this.
5,Just buy it - it's awesome,I was looking at so many different product but this one cought my eye for being really cute and unique. My girfriend told me she doesn't like anything but diamonds and I was kind of skeptical about how she is going to react to something that isn't. She loved it - she is wearing it almost every day. I also got a pair of matching earings to go with it as a set. Great quality.
3,"Nice pendant, but buy a Better Chain","The necklace is nice, it is not quite as blue as shown here in the picture. If they could show the true color of it, I think more people would like it. I would reccomend buying a better chain. The one that comes with this necklace is not very strong."
5,Fantastic French Toothpaste!,I used to only be able to get this toothpaste when I visited France. Thankfully you can find it at a few retailers in the US now and on line. This is a fantastic whitening toothpaste. I've been using it for years.
3,Cute set but ....,"This is a pretty set but it has the look and feel of the Corelle dishes. So if you want a set that is everyday durable and cheaper, Corelle is comparable."
1,Try working with this kind of customer support from Lenox,"So we see that Lenox is offering a rebate on some of their dishes. The more you buy, the bigger your rebate. So we jump in and buy some Lenox. Submit all the paperwork. Get a rejection letter from Lenox telling us that we have 7 days from the date she wrote the letter to provide additional PROOF that we actually paid for the dishes. By the time we get the rejection letter, we have 3 days left to express mail bank statement showing we paid. Think I ever will deal with Lenox? Still don't have a rebate. I think they lie."
5,fantastic dinnerware,Quality is evident as you handle this dinnerware; there are six coordinated designs and they are lovely! Just look out as you'll get hooked on this pattern and be looking for matching serving pieces!
5,butterfly set,This product is machine washable and microwaveable.Every person who has seen it likes them and ask where I got it.I would recommend this product for anybody looking for a tastful set.
5,Lenox Butterly Meadow set. These are great!,"These are absolutely beautiful dishes and I love them. The patterns are so delicate, yet the plates are very durable. I really liked the variety of patterns on each piece. Even the back of the dishes have butterflies. I was happy to see them at such a discount here. I noticed they are also discounted the same at Bed, Bath and Beyond and a few other places, but are much cheaper than buying them direct from Lenox, even on sale. This set would make a lovely gift for anyone of any age, not just for an elderly person as suggested in the previous review. :) I highly recommend them."
4,Just what I needed,This is a great vest. Works well for me commuting to work. I should have taken other suggestions to get a size bigger than you need though. It can be tight with jackets underneath. But anyway its sturdy has pockets and is very bright. I don't ride to work without it!
5,A RARE INSIGHT.,"This is a delightfully funny little book in which author/psychic Elizabeth Fuller shares her experiences with her legendary house guest - Bette Davis, who stayed with Fuller and her husband and small son for a month! Amusing episodes include Liz taking Bette to McDonald's (she promised her son a visit) and the attention Davis attracted. Bette and the author watched JEZEBEL together one evening as it aired on the telly. I liked the book because it gives us insight into the real Bette Davis, who could be very child-like and just as vulnerable as anyone. Well worth reading!"
5,Terrific read!,"I came on to this one late, but it was well worth the wait! I read everything--both in and out of the genre--and what's amazing about this guy Elliot is that he's really a mainstream writer doing thriller fiction. And what a thriller! Characterization that you just don't find anymore, well crafted plot that's just about as rare and protagonists that somehow manage to be exciting and readable and at the same time wholly authentic and believable. Really, this one's good enough to make Oprah's list, it's that textured and resonant. Don't wait around like I did to get yourself involved with Touch Benson and partner Amanda and the host of strange but incredible people in their lives...go out and buy STILL LIFE now! And if you're listening, Mr. Elliot: PLEASE PLEASE MORE TOUCH BENSON BOOKS!!"
5,Paint It Deadly,"I agree with the majority of the reviews. This was a very entertaining read. I have read all of Michael Connelly, Ridley Pearson, Jeffrey Deaver, etc. and just stumbled into this title at the bookstore. I took a chance and was rewarded. I've gotten pretty good at figuring out the 'twists' but this was a very unusual one which I did not pick up on until very near the end because of how the author phrased the killing episodes. Very nicely done!!!!! And being an L.A. resident gave it extra flair. I will definitely read this author's next book."
2,Couldn't believe the ratings,"I bought this book based on other reader's reviews and couldn't believe such a hackneyed plot and poor writing would merit this kind of praise. One gets the sense that author Elliot wished he were his own creation in that virtually every female on the planet is instantly attracted to ""Touch"" Benson (of course he's both attractive AND intelligent...).The book reads like a bad movie, and the ending is not especially surprising given the fact that such twists have been better explored by writers like Margaret Millar and Stanley Ellin - far superior writers with a real gift for the language. Skip this one."
4,Not a book to analyze,"I am a very slow reader and was very happy when it only took me 2 days to read this. It was fast moving and good writing. I would recommend this to anyone who is mature enough to read it. After awhile it got very old hearing about...high school oriented language... Not a book I'd recommend to my parents. However, the book had well done plot twists and kept me interested the whole way so I'd recommend this book, but it's not one to read several times or analyze, but a good novel nonetheless."
3,"A TYPICAL, PREDICTABLE POLICE NOVEL!","Bruce Elliot's first novel, ""Still Life,"" is nothing to run out to the stores in a hurriedly manner and buy as soon as you can. It is a good novel, don't get me wrong, but it is very predictable and similar to every other suspense serial killer novel that there is in the world. The main character, Detective Ariel ""Touch"" Benson, is a very unlikeable character who acts likes a loser because of his large amounts of problems and excess usage of profanity on every page. The ending was very easy to figure out and typical. If you need a book just to fill up time, then read ""Still Life,"" ...."
2,"A bit too much of everything, but a promising author","I was not crazy about this book. The sex was too much,the violence was too much, the characters were caricatures -but it was interesting. And I will try future books bythis author."
1,why? just......why???,"you know. i dont even know what to say. i read this book and i really didnt expect much from it because of the prologue and the tacky cover. but i wasnt expecting this. this book had enough action for me to keep on stringing along, but i was waiting for something cool to happen the whole time...critics are right. it IS unsettling, but not in a good thrilling way. in a weird tacky and homoerotic way. dont read this book..."
5,A Villian to rival Dr. Lecter,"I was surprised at how good this book was, especially for a first-time author. It's a scary police procedural book, but the hero (or maybe antihero) named Touch Benson is really just another human being, and a guy who can't seem to grasp the fact that he's attracted to women who are trouble. Touch falls in love with Teri, who's a beautiful radio psychologist that's being stalked by a serial killer, one that loves to make 'art' out of his victims.His partner, Amanda, is as well drawn as Touch Benson is, and the killer has to be the most chilling character since Silence of the Lambs. I read this book in one setting, and never did guess the ending. Highest recommendations"
3,they work,no complaints does what it is suppose to doeasy to screw itnto dorr jam and keeps door from swaying in the jam
4,"Insightful and intelligent, although a bit repetitive...","Kierkaagard's Attack Upon ""Christendom"" was written, not as an attack upon Christianity as a whole, as many believe, but as an attack upon the Lutheran state religion present during his lifetime. He offers a great deal of evidence showing how the priests in his native Denmark are not, as they believe, ""Witnesses to the Truth"", but are in fact liars who mislead the masses and merchants who have their careers (which is, in K.'s view, the wrong way to look at it) only to make money and have a royally subsidized position.All of this does, however, become somewhat prolix, as this book is actually just a series of articles and pamphlets that he wrote in a 2-year span, which were then combined into the present work. Still, though, this book is an enjoyable read, due to the satirical style of K.'s writing and the, however arguable, relevance of the subject. I recommend reading ""Training in Christianity"", though, as an introduction to this book."
4,One of the best,I feel this song is one of the best McGraw has made. Great lead vocals and beautiful backup by Patty Loveless will surely help take this song to number one.
1,Mac lip liner,"I was not satisfied with this product. The liner was too thin and it would break upon applying it.I use the other lip liners from Mac and they are always my favorite! I love Mac products, but this one was not a good fit for me."
4,Works for what I needed,"In case you're wondering like I did, this product is designed to mount a monitor to the side of or between two seats. It is fully adjustable in all directions.I bought this mount for a PYLE monitor so I could mount it to the headrest of the second row seat for my son to watch from his car seat. Since the car seat is rear-facing, this mount allows the monitor to be mounted to the side of the seat out of kicking range of our 11 month old. It could be a little more stable, but as long as the road isn't overly bumpy, it works fine."
2,good looking mount,"I installed this mount in my windstar, between the front seats. it was easy to mount and looks good, However, my year old touched it and it fell apart. the plastic bracket crumbled from the inside out."
5,Farming and Women,Good resource for those interested in the history of women and farming. Provides information during that important time.
5,Very heavy & melodic,"I've been a Paradise Lost fan since Draconian Times. I think this is their best effort in years and might even be my favorite album from them. It's on constant rotation on my MP3 player. Notable tracks are ""Never for the Damned"", ""The Enemy"" and ""Praise Lamented Shade"" which is a very dark and churning song. Very passionate vocals and melodies. This is a great release from a great band."
3,not as good as there past...,"compared to gothic, one second, or reflections, they went in a totaly different definately gets a bit to get used to."
4,Great start for writing a Partnership Agreement,This book gives you an excellent foundation for writing a partnership agreement. It saves tremendously on the cost of having a lawyer write the whole agreement. We just had to use a lawyer to insure nothing was omitted.
4,Good band,"I like this band very much. I see them play in Los Angeles, and they are very good in concert. They are very different from all other bands and make a good show."
5,Cabula is amazing live,I saw you guys in Chicago and you were totally the best band there. Everybody I asked said the same thing. Let me know next time you come back.
4,fine jazz organ CD,"Saxophonist Nat Simpkins is fronting an excellent quartet with Dave Braham (organ), Eric Johnson (guitar) and Cecil Brooks III (drums). They play several originals, mostly mid tempo numbers, a slow blues (Slo movin' freight) and a ballad (Autumn in New York). The sound is funky, bluesy with great solos by Eric Johnson and Dave Braham (especially on Gospel truth). The tributes to Arnett Cobb and Eddie Cleanhead Vinson are most welcome too. Good, swingin' jazz."
2,It feels like a connect the dots with some missing dots,"Four chapters in and I am ready to ditch the book. It lacks quality conceptual explanation paired with questionable content organization. Learning how to construct a circuit diagram is interesting but the information does not touchdown to earth nearly enough to make it practical for novice conceptual understanding. Throughout the book are streams of rambling facts instead of concise and articulate summarizing of pertinent points. I am constantly pulling from other sources to gain understanding. Once I do have working understanding of the chapters, I am left scratching my head as to the lack-luster or sometimes backwards approach from the book. The material is obviously introductory and perfectly suitable for beginners but, it lacks a sensitivity to the level of exposure students reading it may have. It kind of feels like a connect the dots with some missing dots."
4,Sangean WR-2,"The WR-2 is a superb radio receiver both in terms of AM sensitivity and FM selectivity. I am very satisfied,also, with its audio performance. The WR-2's display leaves alot to be desired. It is hard to see and Sangean should consider using LED's in place of the technology currently employed. I would rate the box as a 4+ and will recommend it to my friends, as long as they do not have to view the display very often."
4,GREAT RADIO BUT...,"Overall a very nice radio w/good sound and looks but it didn't do what I wanted: I wanted to use it w/a timer so it would go on/off automatically. I didn't realize that being digital, using it w/a timer would wipe out the settings. Rather than return it, I gave it to a family member and bought a Tivoli Audio Model One which isn't digital and which doesn't lose the settings when used w/a timer."
2,"dissapointed, I thought that there would be at least 1 John Wayne Movie","This DVD package came up on a John Wayne search and there is not a single John Wayne movie. The ""Stagecoach"" film was a later inferior remake. It was not a bad package, but not what I was led to believe. The ""Long Riders"" was OK and ""The Way West"" provided justification why I had not hear of it."
4,Such a great and quick read!,If your inside on a rainy afternoon then this is the book you'd want to be curled up with. The characters were funny and the story was cute. Jim was such a sweet character. Marti was the perfect blend to make his other half.
1,Terrible!,"This is another of those recycled titles. Originally written around 1930, this book was recycled by the publisher with minor changes so that it could be given a misleading copyright date of 2006. Because the book contains so much commentary that is based upon a pre-Wolrd War II perspective, it is valuable only as a historical relic from that time period. It is so colored by his post-WW I view of Europe, that it makes it of little value and not worth the time to read, except for the most academic."
5,oh yes!,"If your one of the skeptical folks who are afraid of tryn' new things...I assure you. This is WELL WORTH your dollar! I feel like a fool for have had someone talk me into buying this recording... Because without it, I'd be lost. All I can say is: anxiously awaiting the next album!"
5,A classic book unique in tackling how chess players analyse,"This is a classic. Alexander Kotov analyses the way Chess players analyse! This is a highly original book which attempts to look at the thought processes of grandmasters, and provided recommendations and tips for thinking faster and more effectively through the maze of variations one encounters during chess games. Tips include being systematic by enumerating candidate moves at the outset, and following each variation once and once only to avoid going backwards and forwards between variations."
5,"Great classic, must have it","In this book you will learn how to improve your choices about chess moves.The chapters that justify the book are:1, create your elections as trees.2. exercise your vision.3. blind spot4. Positional JudgementThere are other chapters that will be helpful, such as creating your repertoire and other.I think every great chess player, this book had passed through their hands, if you are a coach or player, this book will help a lot to improve your chess.Alexnder Kotov, is one of the players that created the Russian School of Chess, his books have been in the Botvinnik school, and there are sticks out methodologies.It is a book that is geared to players of any level, more EXPERIENCED reader, the easier it is to assimilate the ideas of the book.The benefit of the book is really to get a mental discipline"
4,Good book,"Many other GMs criticize this book as an unrealistic way of trying to analyze. Notice that they say unrealistic, not wrong. They think that it's impossible to analyze so many moves like the computer. But IMO they are forgetting one thing: that Kotov is writing this book for amateurs who have no real intuitions and pattern recognizition abilities to magically 'feel' the position and how the tactics and strategies should go. For amateurs who use this method they will start by trying to analyze a certain position to the fullest extend, then with practice they will develope the natural intuition that the Grandmasters have. That I believe, is the point of Kotov's book here: to give weak players a guidance to how to develope this intuition that virutally all the GM nowadays have that enable to to omit moves that are just wrong."
3,"Classic, but wrong","Chess players should read this book, because it's important and brought a powerful argument on how chess players think. Unfortunately, Kotov is wrong. However, without his book, people wouldn't have the debate brought up. I suggest not buying this book if you want to save money, and instead buy ""Improve Your Chess Now"" or John Nunn's ""Secrets of Practical Chess"" which go into the problems with Kotov's system. Also interesting is ""How to Think in Chess""."
4,good read,"i enjoyed this thiller, it was scary, it was better than most at this price, but does not rate 5 stars."
2,Out of ideas O'Brien?,"Holy cow I feel like I'm in deja vu when reading this book. I just got done reading 'Final Breath' and found it pleasant enough to give this author another go around. I can't be the only one here that hears his record playing over and over am I?Both plots of these books are exactly the same. Both in Seattle, both involve a single mother being given clues to multiple murders that dont happen yet, both encouter break ins where the killers leave hints to the crimes in the house, both of the main characters have a healthy craving for wine and they confide in a close male friend or relative of some kind. Among many more similarities, I have decided that this will be the last book that I get from O'Brien. The only redundant detail that I appreciate in his books are the location, being from Seattle. But I find that he is incredibly lacking in creativity and imgination. This book was a complete replica of another and which ever came first doesn't matter.I think 2 stars is generous."
3,An Okay Read,I was told this author writes in a style similar to Lisa Jackson. No so. It was a descent read but not up to the quality of Lisa.
5,The Best Wooden Hammock on the Market!,"I received this product 24 hours after I placed the order. The item was well packaged with no signs of damage. The instructions were well written and all the required assembly hardware was included in the shipment. Having owned several wooden hammocks in the past, this stand is by far the best. The material is of good quality cypress made in the USA. There are a few knots visible however the overall presentation is outstanding. The product states the item will ""add drastically"" to the look of your garden. I agree. I am extremely pleased with my purchase."
1,Amateur Production,"6 disc Bluray set, individually packaged (for clarification, since there seems to be some confusion.)Note: This set has nothing to do with the BBC Yellowstone mini-series (currently on Netflix Instant).Shot at 30 frames per second on what looks like a first gen HD camera (think evening news quality). The graphics/interface/titles/animations look like they were done by high school students.Super disappointing. Return request for sure."
3,Moves a little klunky.,"Has some good stuff, some boring stuff. I have been to many of these places and I think the video could have been spiced up a bit. It was more like sitting through a high school class film."
3,Nice CD for one that was bought accidently.,"I, like a lot of people bought this cd thinking it was the Eric Johnson from Austin texas. It did not take long for me to realize that is was an Eric Johnson from California if I am not mistaken. It was a nice jazz oriented disc, but the audio is a bit suspect. For this reason, I could only give it 3 stars instead of 4. It would be interesting to know if anyone out there knows if the two EJ's have ever met. It would be nice to see the two of them do a show together."
2,Didn't do it for me,"Some of the arrangements were OK, but Burt himself is, to put it mildly, a little creepy, and I didn't find his commentary added anything to the value of the disk, or the performance of the artists. BTW...Dionne looked positively uncomfortable in his presence."
3,Not what I expected,"Ordered ""One Amazing Night"" with Burt Bacharach for my boyfreind. Enjoyed it so much I wanted one myself. This is not the same as"" One Amazing Night"", but similar."
1,Shorted on order,Only recieved 23 or the 24 individual cups. Like the product but if this is the manner we are going to be recieving the product not worth ordering on line.
5,"Quaker Instant Oatmeal Express Golden Brown Sugar, 1.9-Ounce Cups (Pack of 24)",AAA+++ I love the Quaker Instant Oatmeal Express Golden Brown Sugar. I eat the MOST oatmeal in our family. I love different flavors. I have Oatmeal Cups a couple of times a week in the spring & fall usually every day in the winter.
5,Best on the go Oatmeal,"This product Quaker Oatmeal Express (golden brown sugar) is fantastic. It even tastes better than their regular instant oatmeal packet (maple and brown sugar). I recommend anyone to try this. I guarantee you will love this oatmeal.Quaker Instant Oatmeal Express Golden Brown Sugar, 1.9-Ounce Cups (Pack of 24)"
4,Yummy instant oatmeal,My son uses this in college for quick meals when he doesnt have time for the dining hall. He mixes it with powdered milk and water and says its delicious. My only complaint is the price. Even buying in bulk does not lower the price as compared to purchasing the oatmeal in smaller quantities. My son eats 2 bowls at a time. It is cost prohibitive for the amount of oatmeal you get.
2,disappointed,These come stacked on top of one another.12 in the top case only 10 in the bottom case. Very disappointed.
5,Rip-Roaring Good Time,"Caroline is not only the most beautiful girl in the village of Ripplebrook, she is also one very determined young woman. So when word leaks out that a prince has been turned into a frog, Caroline sets up a series of nets, traps and lochs, searching the swamp in a grid. She kisses hundreds of frogs until she finds Prince Hal, but there is a major problem.... Hal can best be described as a dweeb.Determined to lodge a complaint and receive the handsome prince she was promised, Caroline travels with Prince Hal and the apprentice sorceress Emily to the capital of Melinower. The path to true love is never easy, but first they must save the kingdom, straighten out Rapunzel and Rumplestiltskin, battle magic swords and find out why magical spells really work.A laugh-out-loud read lampooning fairy tales that will be loved by any fan ofTHE PRINCESS BRIDE."
1,Terrible anti-semitic trash,"This book began wonderfully enough. It's fun and silly and parodies the fairy tale genre that I love. But then all of sudden it took a terrible turn. The underlying premise of the book is for the kingdom to expel the Jews to make money.There is nothing funny about this, and it seemed to have no place in such a light-hearted fantasy. It just made me sad, and I'm not even Jewish. I think the author was seriously misguided in his judgment to use this as a subplot. I wouldn't read another book by this author if you paid me to."
3,It has a quiet charm,"I'd rate this as a fun afternoon read. The basic premise of the book, which is reflected in the other books, is that fables pressure reality to be like the fable. The step-daughter cleaning the fireplace must marry a prince, no matter what. The frog kissed by a girl always becomes a prince.But the author adds some unsettling twists.""What if the prince is not handsome?'""What if the swarthy black haired prince with a sneer is actually the good guy""So this book is about the frog who turned into an ugly prince and how he (maybe) finds true love. How does an ugly prince find true happiness?It's not a deep book.It's a book to read on a sunny afternoon in a hammock, sipping something..."
3,"okay tuner, doesnt work right with Vista","If you are planning on using this tuner in Windows XP it will work just as advertised. I tried using in with Windows Vista 64-bit with 8 gb of ram and had nothing but trouble. Lots of static and the audio would make a buzz sound with certain tv stations. I believe it was just not picking up the right frequency for the channels in Vista. I used it with Windows Media Center in Vista and had the problems.I would not recommend using the software or drivers with this card at all, use Media Center or another 3rd party tv tuner application. The software is bloated and can severly take over your machines resources.If you are using XP this is a great tuner, if you are using Vista it's somewhat okay but I'd recommend using one of the Hauppauge tv tuner products."
1,Terrible software and support,"I cannot comment on the hardware, as I never could get it to work on my computer. The so called software included is not worth even trying, and it is impossible to find any updated software on the AMD/ATI website. I was very disappointed with this product, as I have had no problems with the ATI video cards I've had."
2,ATI TV wonder 550 lacks features,Graphics are very good. It does not provide computer auto shutdown after recording. The remote that is available free is worthless. It does not provide all the functions needed to control the capture card such as scheduling. When recording you do not know if it is recording or not. The software has many quirks when using the remote. I would not buy this deviceagain.
2,"Getting strated was disappointing,...",Apparently the company had several software CD's which were defective and did not load up automatically. I did know know this until I called for support and was walked through the process..
1,A waste of time,"I bought this to replace the AVIVO feature that my ATI AIW 9800 video card had. I love that card but since my new motherboard is PCI-E I can't use it anymore. The 550 was a total disappointment.The auto-install on the CD only completely installs the Remote Wonder software, an accessory that's not even in the box. You have to get the ""working"" drivers off ATI's site and if you want to use Catalyst Media Center, you need to dig through the install CD and run it manually (...CMC/CMC/install.exe). The real annoyance is that after doing all that, CMC can't even connect to the card when you choose to watch TV. It just keeps looking for it and eventually crashes. I've tried using three other programs that work with WDM cards but none of them will connect to the card using cable or composite/s-video.After two days of this nonsense I've decided to return it and research the other capture cards. I've read that Hauppauge's image isn't as crisp as ATI's but at least they work."
3,"Great, but not legal for sale","I own this product(TV Wonder Elite), well, owned this product; I recently removed it to add a new card and broke the thing when I had it out. Anyway, I went to purchase a new one of these and the store clerk informed me that as of early this year it, and other similar products were pulled from the shelves due to a new federal law banning it. The law states that all cards not capable of displaying the new HDTV format be pulled from the shelves because soon all channels, including broadcast channels will be in HDTV format. So I 'had' to spend more money so that I would be able to see my tv signal in the near future."
3,Prepare to get wet!,"I bought this for my pool, thinking that it was a regular raft. However it isn't. When you lay in it, your whole body is uderwater except for your head. I like it because you can carry it anywhere and it comes with a pouch to put it in, but you have to inflate it every time you want to use it. Also when you fold it up, you must deflate it. I think that this is a pretty cool raft, but don't buy it if you want to stay dry!"
1,Disappointed,"I am really disappointed in my Spring Float. When I aired it up the first time, one side kept curling up when I would lay on it, like it is supposed to do you put it in the carrying bag. I exchanged it for another because I was sure it was a ""fluke"", but the second one is worse! It will not lay flat AT ALL! Very annoying. I tried different amounts of air and different size people, and it just curled up around everyone."
2,Kindle edition needs a price adjustment,"This book looks promising, but I'm at a loss why the publisher is charging 10 dollars for a Kindle copy when used paper copies are available for 1 cent. I'll wait for the Kindle price to drop to 99 cents or less before giving it a try."
5,great skins,"great skins and the price was a third of what we paid retail in the music store, should have shopped first."
2,"Great Game, flawed discs","This a great game with many great improvements, but only if you get a disc that is not flawed.This is true of my disc and if you search forums on the internet you will find the same thing happening to many others. During certain, and repeateble times in the game, the game stops and you get ""Disc may be dirty or damaged"" error. I experience this when trying to load my 3rd Tiger Challenge and during season mode. Also, when playing St. Andrew's, when Hole #2 is trying to load, I get a black screen and am not even able to access my dashboard or shutdown the console via the controller. My disc is completely free of scratches or anyother cosmetic damages.Neither Microsoft nor EA will replace the discs, each laying blame with the other. Many think the blame should go to EA for using discs that arent good quality.So buyer beware, great game but flawed hardware."
3,Great game---but you can't read anything!,"Although we are enjoying the game play of Tiger Woods 07...great graphics, lots of fun...the font is so blurry that you can barely read it. It's definitely not our TV...we are using component video and, like I said, the graphics are great...but to read your score or tips or instructions or anything on the game, we have to squint our eyes and get closer to the TV...not fun and really takes away from the whole experience. EA Sports has said there's nothing they can do and offered a simple ""sorry"". The game would definitely be 5 stars if it wasn't for the font problem. EA Sports usually produces such quality games...very disappointing."
2,Hit and Miss w/ Tiger '07,"EA has obviously listened to the maddened consumer who screamed for more detail in something other than Tiger Woods face. The problem is they've overcompensated.Pros-More courses, a driving range, better customization for game face, excellent multi-player modeCons-Obscene ball control, no new golfers worth a damn, an introductory that makes the game unenjoyable for the 1st 20 tournamentsThey goofed. Instead of making a better golf game, they just made it more difficult. I'd learn to play real golf if I wanted to try this hard.They HAD a chance to shock and put Mickelson in as a playable golfer, besides a name on the leaderboard.They might NOT have made your golfer's improvement worse than VCR instructions.They COULD have realized a smaller hole legend is just annoying.They MAY have recognized that Tiger Woods is a golf game made to be fun, not homework.If you have '06, take a pass and pray for next year."
4,Fore!,I've been a pretty big fan of the Tiger Woods series since they have introduced the new swing system. Tiger Woods 06' for 360 was a big disappointment so I was really looking for an improvement this year. They introduced some new courses giving a little more of a variety. A big improvement is the Gameface option. There are a lot of different customization options available to taylor your golfer however you choose. Overall the game is a big improvement on last years. A lot of the modes are still the same and I haven't had a chance to play on Live yet. The putting system is new and also takes a little time to get used to. I really wish I could see a create a course option and some of the custom courses from previous Tiger Woods titles to be included with next years game. Keeping my fingers crossed.
3,Tiger Woods 07,"The game is great fun if you enjoy golf. However if you have Tiger Woods 06, 05, 04 ...etc; there's not much new to the game. The graphics are a bit improved, and a small new feature here or there.If you haven't bought a recent version of this game then I highly recommend it. But if you have 06, or 05 I wouldn't run out to buy 07."
4,Finally Quick Games,My hubbie and I love the quick games.We can sit down and battle it out for a quick game and then get back to making dinner or playing with our kids.There are so many different game to play we never get bored.We wanted to get '06 but instead waited for '07. The wait was well worth it. I guess it the developers are finally getting some quality after Microsoft released the code so late.
3,Misundertood,"Hi! This is a great game, very funny and cool... but there was a mistake! I bought the ""Tigerwoods Pga Tour07"" to XBOX 360, but what i received was a to ""XBOX"" and not to ""XBOX 360"" like had bought... Unfortunaly i gifted my nephew that lives in brazil and do not give more to undo the misunderstanding... I believe that there was no evil intention of the seller, only a mistake... Still remains a good game and i recommended it."
4,Can't watch golf? Just play it.,"I got this for the achievements and ended up greatly enjoying and appreciating it. I can't give it 5 stars because much of it feels like work, but every swing is exciting so it's very replayable."
3,Cheap but clunky,"I really like the ergo design, and this was a nice low price point for me to spend some time with an ergo keyboard. But the actual keys are kinda clunky - quite noisy, a bit hard to press, and not smooth acting.Also, I hadn't noticed (though see that it's now clear in the photo on Amazon.com) that the wristpad is a solid, flat, plastic, integrated annoyance. It isn't comfortable, isn't paddable, and isn't removable - yuck!So, it's worth the price, but that's about it. For comfort and satisfication, spend two or three times this price, which still isn't much."
3,You get what you pay for,"Even after being told a million times to not be cheap, I went and did it again. Please, go pay a little more and get a better keyboard. The wrist rest doesn't come off, requiring me to completely pull out my keyboard tray and sit three feet away from my monitor just to reach the keys (though I guess that's better for my eyes). I'm tempted to get a hacksaw and cut the thing off. Also, the main Enter key started sticking within a month of buying it, and I've gone out of my way to keep food away from it. It's so much fun watching 50 windows open unstoppably, one after the other, because your Enter key is stuck. I haven't noticed that the keys are that noisy, though when the space bar releases it is noticeably louder than the other keys. All in all, I guess this keyboard is okay, but if I had a do-over I'd definitely buy something a little nicer."
2,a warning...,"Ok, so i picked this one up because track number two is called ""Hector's Radio Mix"", so I assumed that this cd contained a Hex Hector remix. Now a warning to all Hex Hector fans. I do not believe that this is the same man. This remix is baaaaad, and sounds nothing like Hex. I don't even think that Hex could help this one though. Well, he could as long as he got rid of the ridiculous chorus. ""It's all 'bout the money. It's all 'bout the dum dum diddy dum dum"". What is that? It drives me nuts! The verses are ok, and so are Meja's vocals, but this song is ridiculous. A couple of the remixes are so-so (Pierre J's mix as wells as DJ Zeb & Sezam's mix), but nothing special, and nothing that will ever be remembered. Skip it."
2,Impractical,"This book should be titled ""The Physics of Musical Instruments."" I was hoping to get info to help me design a new Belizean form of Ukulele, and it was no help at all. Info on the resonance of stringed instruments is sketchy at best. The book concentrates on the characteristics of sound, using a instruments (actually experiments) such as a metal cylinder balanced on a couple of balloons. Mildly interesting but not relevant for me."
1,Very Disappointed!,The sound was not clear or good. Sounded like an amature did this. Gave it for a gift wish I had known the quality would have sent it back.
5,Fabulous!,"Photos are terrific. The directions are detailed and easy to follow. Wonderfully, fabulous jars to create!!"
2,Imaginative twist on what could have been.,"The concept of C.A.D.S. was a well conceived idea, but the story line is shifty and dirty (in more ways than one). I liked these books because of the technology it presented. I hated them for the lack of inspiration and direction. After reading them I never felt uplifted."
1,Beware deceptive description,"Please note and be forewarned: the composer AS WELL AS performer(s) shown listed for this release is Eric Coates. I eagerly purchased it as a great many recordings from the 30's - 50's of Coates conducting his own music have been released on CD as of late. This recording, however, is of Coates' orchestral music arranged for band and actually performed by The Royal Yeomanry Band. The performances and the recording are certainly nowhere near as distinguished as the recent Naxos release of Coates' music for band (part one.) Nowhere is recording info divulged; it sounds ADD if not AAD. Scarcely advisable even as a curiosity; certainly not the find it would have been had it been Coates' own performances as described."
3,"A Fine Edition, But not the Best!","When one of my Shimer students saw Mr. Erdman's alternate arrangement of ""Auguries of Innocence"" he threw his book at a bush. Some of my students think that ""Auguries"" is one of Blake's greatest poems and I agree with them. Its structure is a key to Blake's vast mythic system. Without that key there's little hope of passing through Jerusalem's wall to the places where heaven and earth coalesce in a cosmic orgasm of intellectual joy.Mr. Erdman is a marvelous scholar, dedicated to Blake. Mr. Bloom is as inspiring as he is informative. But for Blake in its most pure form I prefer Sir Geoffrey Keynes' edition. He was not a professional scholar, but a learned amatuer in the finest sense of the word. When he wasn't busy with his medical practice he was lovingly creating the best complete edition of Blake's poetry and prose..."
5,Soothing,It's amazing how soothing just reading William Blake's poetry is on the troubled soul. I always look for his work to ease my mind and lift my spirit. Everyone should treat themselves to his work. Peace be with you.
5,"This is "" The Divine William "" !","I can't compare this edition of Blake's Poems to others because this is the first collection of his that I have owned. But after spending much time in his work it seems that what Herman Melville said of William Shakespeare, ( his "" acquaintance with the Divine William "" ), is more appropiately attatched to William Blake."
1,Badly Edited,"While it is nice to have Blake's complete poetry and prose at my disposal, I have to admit that I much prefer editions which include proper grammar and punctuation. Things such as commas where commas should be, periods where periods should be, a lack of run-on sentences because of the proper use of such commas and periods, and also commas and quotation marks before and after dialogue, are usually how things are done when writing proper English. Seriously, did I just get the only bad version of this book -it seems like nothing but a series of typos- or have the people who wrote such positive reviews not actually read it? Was it edited by monkeys? Perhaps, I'm missing something. Someone, please enlighten me.P.S. Does anyone know of another complete edition that knows more thoroughly the correct structure of the English language? I love William Blake and it would be nice to read his complete works in a form more worthy of his immense stature."
3,THE FRIENDS HAVE BEEN DISSED.,"THOUGH I LIKE MANY OF THE SONGS ON THIS COMPILATION I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE ALBUMS FROM WHICH THEY WERE OBTAINED. THERE ARE THREE ALBUMS THAT I THINK SHOULD BE IN CD FORMAT AND THEY ARE ""REAL FRIENDS"", ""WHATEVER"" AND ""FRIENDS AND PEOPLE"". WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE THESE MARKETERS THINKING? THERE ARE SONGS ON THESE ALBUMS THAT REALLY SHOULD BE HEARD AND INCLUDE ""LADY MAE"", ""WILLA FAY"" AND A WONDERFUL VERSION OF THE SONG ""PEOPLE""."
5,pikake lotion is wonderful!,We found this lotion in Hawaii 18 years ago and we could'nt find it in the states after that until now. Thank you for making it easier.
2,it's one of the best cds i've ever listened to!,all the songs have a deep meaning. i think that all of their work has definitely paid off. if you don't love dave matthews band you're crazy!!!!!
2,Better Stoned?,"Um. I have nothing against bands that are ""mainstream"". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre.I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song.Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer."
1,This is the worst.,"What is this garbage? This is perfect for those ""psuedo-intellectual"" college students who look forward to the weekend so they can go to their cheap dance clubs in hopes of finding someone whom they can take home and sleep with. There is no emotion in this music at all. It is simply a cheap, rehashed, corney derivitive of the oh so boring and corney early 90s Pearl Jam era. Everyone i have ever known to like this music spends most of their time drinking Molson canadian and talking about their new Ski-doo they just dropped 6 g's on. Thank you Dave Matthews for bringing the world of idiots together. as for the music? Dave Matthews is one of the worst singers i have ever heard. The music is simple and cheap. If i hear one more Ovation acoustic guitar being played on the 9th fret i'm gonna scream. This music makes me angry. With the hundreds of great indie bands out their busting their buts, this makes it thru????? can someone please explain this to me."
3,Don't get me wrong,"Now, don't get me wrong. Dave Mathews is one of the best songwritters that are alive today, but this is not the best dave mathes CD If given the choice to buy it again I would not, I would however by Live Att Luther College, which is my very next purchase.However in this CD you get a studio recording of some of Dave Mathews best songs, such as Crash, Too much, and 41. But those are just about the only songs I will stop and listen to over and over again."
3,Ordinary,"A couple of good songs but nothing much. Dave seems to thing that the more instruments that you put on a track all playing at once,the better it sounds. I don't agree. Go for his acoustic tracks."
5,It's Awsome Baby!!!!,I like all of the Dave Matthews Band music. I was resently looking for mp3 music to add to my collection of DMB songs. I have and came across some live recordings of concerts. I found a live taping of a concert they put on in Hartford Connecticut at the Meadows Music Theathre. It was awsome to hear he actual show from close by recorded live in MP3 format. But also buy the albums they put out.
5,Feel good,"I first went to a Dave show two years ago in Columbus, OH I never heard of Dave Matthews and was completely drawn in. there is a magical feeling it's like hippy meets blues meets rock. You walk away feeling up beat and content.Whenever I have a bad day only a Dave tune can cheer me up, keep it up DAVE, you guys are the best in my book"
4,This CD is a great buy because the songs all mean something!,My favorite song is Cry Freedom because it really makes you think. It actually makes you want to take out your lighter and hold it up high!
5,Absolutely mind blowing!!,"I originally bought this album to listen to this new cat everybody was talking about, Carter Beauford (the drummer), but as I listened to the rest of the album, it stuck to me like glue.Not only are the songs great, but the musical artistry is fantastic. Being a drummer myself, I close my eyes to try and imagine the things he is doing on the drum kit.If you are an up and coming drummer and want to hear one of the new greats, check this album out"
2,Highly overrated,"I appear to be in the distinct minority when it comes to this band. Their music is trite at best and their songwriting is quite dull. ""Crash"" suppposedly is the hit-single off of this album, but it sounds like any typical Top-40 song on the radio these days. In their favor, at least the fellows can play their instruments."
1,DMB brings music to an all-time low,"Just when you thought ""popular"" msuci could't get any worse, here comes DMB to further wreck your life. All those pitiful, yuppy, pseudo-intellectual, quasi-sophisticated, Starbuck's drinking meatheads who have enormous Dave Matthews posters should try and listen to some real music. For you true music connisseurs out there try Insane Clown Posse or Lil Troy."
1,We must put an end to Dave Matthews Band!,"I simply cannot believe that this group still exists, let alone ever made it onto the radio. First of all, none of its members can sing; their voices sound like nails across a chalkboard. And the songs that they have written are complete nonsense that do not sound good at all. As a musician and lifetime appreciator of music, I find it insulting that anyone would support a group that sounds as awful as Dave Matthews Band. This proves that anyone can throw together a bunch of [...] and not put any thought or effort into it, and it will sell. Come on America, we are not that ignorant!!!"
1,Crash.....and Burn,"Great writing. Great musicianship. Nice band chemistry. Horrible vocals. The Dave Matthews Band would be great, if only Dave would keep his mouth shut and hire a vocalist. He has this whiny, pathetic voice that, like a cheap wine, gets worse with age. What a waste of money and a big letdown."
5,The CD is one of the best I have ever heard.,"Dave Matthews is one of the best bands in the world. He receives very little recognition in the pop charts, but he still manages to sell more CDs than any one else in the World. All his CDs are great, and this one is no exception."
4,Work that violin! Lyrics that make you think.,"What can I say not the best work by Dave Mathew's band but very good work none the less. One of my favorites is ""Too Much"" . It is a song about how greedy people become without even realizing it. Excellent lyrics and violin on this CD. You'll love this and other CDs by Dave. The band interchanges from hard rock to flighty soft music. Not that this is irritating just a little puzzling. However if they are dipicting life, looks like they hit the nail on the head. Erica -love-planet checking out."
5,This is just AWESOME STUFF!,Glad to write a review of this great CD. This album is truly unique and goes very very deep into the soul. Thanks Dave and the Entire DMB Band! You can crash into me anytime! You lift up my soul and make me feel truly alive!
5,Crash: A wonderful album,"It is important to realize that this album, the best my the band so far, should not be solely reviewed based upon the first four songs. These songs are highly commercialized, and not what this album is about (although Two Step is fantastic). The true brilliance in this album is found in Lie in Our Graves, the greatest DMB song to date. See, the best Dave Matthews Band songs are ones without much of his great, but unspectacular lyrics. In Lie in our Graves, we have that, for simply as a jazz song, it is one for the ages. Regardless, this album is full of other wonderful songs such as the beautiful Let you Down, and as stated, Two Step. I of course highly reccomend this album."
1,I Hate Dave.,"Who's with me? I don't care if you are not, Dave is horrible. Too much makes me want to cry, it is sooooo bad. I didn't mind #41 and Two Step, but now they just add to the agony. Dave is regretably a ""college sound"" so you have to endure his gnarled, head-spliting, gruesomely over-accentuated voice. Someone needs to put him to sleep, the poor thing. I'm glad not many people liked ""Everyday"", even hardcore Dave fans... hopefully he will keep this trash up and I will only find his music in the bargan bins, his name under the ""where are they now?"" files...."
1,Don't Get It..,"I just don't get it. This band is not as spiffy as many people would like to believe. It is also another way for college boys, or un-college boys to devote their time trying to use music to ""win"" that one girl over.. just to leave that one girl completely bitter towards this group and this cd.If you are into REAL music that isn't on the Top 40, try something else."
1,What a piece of junk,"This album is very popular among high school students and some stupid college kids. It is not the greatest album in the world being both musically complex and great. It is instead a mere pop album and I think it sucks. If you want to listen to what everyone else likes, buy this album, if not, DON'T."
1,One word: TERRIBLE,This album is a mish mesh mess that is almost unlistenable. The jams are *awful* and the only thing Mr. Mathews has proved is how long he can drone on. This album is now appropietly used as a coaster on my coffee table.
5,A Masterpiece,"This cd is the greatest of Dave Matthews Band. I have heard his other songs, I have some of his other stuff but this is the cd that I keep returning to. It is perfect for car trips or just relaxing. The song Two Step is amazing, it's absolutely phenomonal. The rest of the songs on the album are great, this album is absolutley a work of art. The album flows together, it is a must have for any collection."
5,A Great CD that I listen to all the time.,"This CD has some of the greatest pop songs that the 90's ever created. Add that with Dave Matthews great songwriting, and you have a great mix."
2,"Ew, ew, ew!","I went to the CD store yesterday, and I feel guilty if I don't buy anything when I leave, so I picked this. I HATE ""Crash Into Me"" with a fiery passion, but I decided to give the rest of this CD a chance. Boy am I sorry! It has scarred me for life. The nice guitar licks are the only thing that kept me from rating this one star. Dave Matthews's lyrics and singing are an abomination on the music industry. My six cats were in the room while I was listening to this, and they all started crying at the door to be let out! He's a good guitarist, but someone ought to go up to him and say ""STRUM IT AND SHUT IT!"" and hand him a copy of Barenaked Ladies' Stunt CD, which is what REAL music sounds like. This filth of a CD is worth only lining my cats' litter boxes, which is what it is doing now, jewel case and all."
4,classic DMB,"A classic DMB album, it stradles the gap between grass roots and full-blown mainstream arenas, uniting the two - the most obvious example within their career that adeptly demonstrates they can represent both worlds at the same time. ""#41"" & ""Two Step"" are my faves."
5,The best one-two punch....,"The pairing of #41 and Say Goodbye is outstanding and it's very hard to listen to one without the other. The cool-jazz feel of #41 gets you in the mood to hear Dave wax fantastic about an amazing one-night love. And those aren't even the best songs! My personal favorite is Lie in Our Graves, which if you listen carefully, has the blueprint for living life to the fullest. Nothing new, but so easy to forget in this world. ""I can't believe that we would lie in our graves wishing we had spent our living days well, I can't believe that we would lie in our graves dreaming of things that we might have been."""
3,Crash Into Me a fabulous song,"I really liked the song, Crash Into Me, which I why I got this CD. I must say, however, that pretty much the rest of the CD is a dissapointment. Okay, okay, there are a few other good songs, but basically, I just program in that one track and listen to it over and over again."
5,Truly ingenous. Simply spectacular,The Dave Matthews band consists of 5 talented men who so indescritly make music that changes lives!!
3,It has it's mix of good and bad songs,"This CD is very good however it still contains the same old ""jam sessions"" after every song which I do not particulary like andif you like DMB you know what I am talking about. Good Songs are So much to say, Two Step, Crash into Me, and a few less notable others. Overall a good investment"
1,Bloody orrible!!!,"This has to be one of the worst purchases I have ever made!! The whole CD is basically a total waste of plastic. The song ""crash into me"" is too stupid for words, and the the ""proudest monkey"", would make a great song to get a criminal confess to anything if he was locked up in a small room and had to listen to this trash for a couple of hours. After listening to this dribble I'll stick to my Nate King Cole, Tony Bennett, who can actually sing and not have to sing about ""monkeys""!!!!!!!!!"
1,Crash,Do not support the sale of Live DMB concerts as you can get them for free by trading with other other fans...
1,Polyrhythmic Knuckle Head,"I don't get it! Every song this guy records sounds the same , a hambone mixture of knee slap Hee-Haw guitar rhythyms and Mr Haney singing over it. This stuff is like Forest Gump with a record deal. I am not sure when this discharge was released but was unfortunate enough to suffer through a few numbers. I gotta tell you I was ready to get back to that sock drawer-in silence . The only thing that could make some of these songs worse actually occured - HORNS! Now you have Glen Miller meets Hee Haw meets Mr Haney.If it were not for Matthews ability to semi-yodel he would be the poster child for the tone deaf- he throws you off with that yodel trick. People revere this guy as a great guitar player which I don't get either- throws you off with that Junior Samples knee slap move - Smoke and Mirrors.I hope he stops soon!"
1,dave matthews band is lame!,i hate this band! they wish they were as good as the spice girls.and who names a band dave matthews band. i dont make a band and name it andy lofaros band
5,THEIR BEST ONE BY FAR!!!!,"I like the first 3 albuns from DAVE MATTHEWS, and in my opinion this one is their best by far!!!!The band really shine with their powerful mix of pop, rock and jazz...I like all the songs...if you like rock you may like this one..."
5,Incredible,"Well theres ""So much to Say"" about this CD. None of them should be skipped because they are all amazing. The song that is the most moving is #41. The first time I heard it, it blew me away. DMB has come out with yet another amazing CD that shows you what true musicians are. ""Cry Freedom"" is a beautiful song that deals with opression that opens your eyes to how the world can be interpreted through music. Great job DMB, and keep up the great work."
3,Solid material... a good risk for a non-Dave fan like myself,"I've heard from Dave die-hards like my best friend that many hardcore fans don't like this album because they feel Dave somewhat ""sold out""... but in my mind, they're missing the critical point... if you sell out and the material actually sounds BETTER (especially with regard to the general mainstream!!!!), then one has justification....Case in point with Crash... Dave usually kicks his albums off well (As he did with Under The Table and Dreaming)... and this time, 'Too Much' really does satisfy as a follow up to the title track... I just feel that there is better sequencing in this album compared to Under The Table... the jazz infused semi-funk of 'Too Much' is really really impressive... I like it.... and then there are songs like 'Tripping Billies' that have great energy and a great bluegrass feel... so for not being a ""Davehead"", I think this is the best album for a beginning fan.."
4,crash by dave matthews band,"I feel that the album crash is one of his best albums. It has the songs crash, drive in drive out, and i believe stay. These songs are one of my favorite. They have such a great sound to them and the lyrics are so appealing. When ever i am sort of down or in a bad mood, all I have to do is put in a Dave Matthews Band cd and i am good to go. It does not matter which one, they are all amazing. If you have never heard a Dave cd then you are definately missing out."
3,"ok, ok","i understand where all the one-star reviews are coming from; opinions that hate dave matthews band for putting out mindless drivel on lame subject matter. but i have to disagree. to me, crash is about feeling good, about relaxing to moving sound. not really about complexity in lyricism or songs that are necessarily 'about' something. i have no idea what #41 is about, but its one of the prettiest songs i've ever heard. and that song alone is worth the bucks, or at least a couple more stars"
5,smooooth,"Usually live DMB is more of my staple, but Crash brings us back to the studio where the band first put laid down these tracks. Rarely will you find an album with so many nuances and well blended instruments. One of the highlites is #41-->Say Goodbye. These two songs were meant to be together and they flow oh so nicely. Check out Two Step, Let You Down, Cry Freedom, Tripping Billes, hell, check them all out, this is a great cd! it's essential for a reason. The Dave Matthews Band is in it's best form. If you like this recording, check out the darker, Before These Crowded Streets."
3,Decent business,This product arrived in the same condition as business described and promptly. The only reason they do not get 5 stars is because of shipping. I paid $2.95 for shipping and it arrived with a $1.35 worth of shipping paid for. I would have been okay with this except I owed the USPS money for the shipping.
3,Not Much To Say,"While the Dave Matthews Band is generally inoffensive, it's still just barely a cut above most of the alternative dreck floating through the air waves these days. ""So much to Say"" is the only song I can really say I like combining good, sometimes funny lyrics with an upbeat and catchy melody. Songs can not survive on simply lyrics alone, however, as the extremely dull ""Crash Into Me"" proves, being hardly noticeable musically. Other songs such as ""Too Much"" can be exactly that for ones ears. As for the rest of it, I can stand to listen to it, and it is better than much of its genre. I just wish they could realize that good music lies in the melody"
5,Other bands should hope to be this talented.,"DMB is like a fine wine, the more time one takes to get familiar with the band, the more one appreciates every aspect of the band. I owned several DMB CD's before I heard a live concert, and Wow, I have a new respect for a band I already loved. Get over the alleged campyness and just stop and listen. I can't get enough of this CD. It goes with me to the gym, on trips, to the beach, and anywhere else I want to be filled with a pleasant energy."
2,ive had better...,"while its adorable in theory, the design of this ring leaves something to be desired.i got it to replace another screw that i had, thinking that a white-gold star would be much classier than an ex-cz-sporting prong on my nose. when i put it on however, the screw sticks out of my nostril making for a really questionable and tacky silver ""booger"" situation.i would recommend this screw for someone who is pierced a little closer to the middle of the nose than the edge so more room is left to hide the back of the screw. otherwise consider yourself warned, and please give me credit for starting the whole ""ambiguous silver booger"" trend."
5,Soul stirring reading,"This book was an exellent book on the life of John "" Praying"" Hyde. His testimony is sure to give you a boost of encouragment."
4,good middle-value choice,"This attractive, light-to-middle-weight stationery features colors in the beige range. As the product name suggests, light map-and-globe graphics create a watermark-like effect at a very good price.It's not fine stationery but makes a nice statement for most purposes. Colors are acceptably within what I consider to be a masculine range, which--being a member of the masculine race myself--is a feature I look for in note cards and other stationery.Because this product does not come with envelopes, you'll need to buy beige no. 9 envelopes."
1,Superficial Study,"I have had this book for many years. Every paragraph is marked up with some error of interpretation or fact. I see no evidence that the author consulted an article that I wrote thirty some years ago on the development of infantry equipment. And he is careless with the proper nomenclature. He uses jargon such as ""product improved"", a modern term, which is not relevent to the period and was never used in the period 1910 to very recently.The author simply did not do enough research nor understand what he read. The subject is simply too vast to cover in such a short format. But the illustrations are excellent, it is just the text that I cannot recommend."
4,If you like or want to discover science,Joy Hakim has written a nice trilogy of the history of science. Not too detailed but just the right perspective to gain an appreciation of science whether yoiung or old.
4,"Well written, illustrations great","This is written text-book style, but much more interesting to read. The chronology of science, and in the following books in the series, makes a nice, unique history of science."
3,A Historical Approach to Science,"This science book contains lots of information on the foundations of science. It is a good reference book for science, but by no means a comprehensive science text. It contains lots of engaging pictures and the chapters are arranged very nicely.I think this book could be used well in conjunction with other history and science books.I would like it if Ms. Hakim had perhaps included some references or experiment suggestions to correlate with each chapter."
2,beautiful unpracticle sled,We bought the sled living in a snowy area for our 21 month old to take him with us while XC skiing. BUT the sled is not steady and tips over sideways throwing his face straight into the snow. We returned it very sad. He had really hoped it would work because it's beautiful.
2,Not what we expected,We were a little disappointed with this movie on Washington.There was very little narration and most of the time you just had to guess as to where you were and what you were seeing.We have a film on Idaho and a very pleasant voiced man narrates the whole film and so you know exactly where you are and what it is you are seeing and he gives a little background on the area you are looking at.I do feel the filming on the Idaho film was higher quality also.So we were disappointed.Washington the Beautiful
4,On the DL this album is off the chain,"People may never hear of this group, but they are just as good as any other r&b group out there today. They can hang with Blackstreet, Dru Hill, 112 etc... If your looking for another group to complete your r&b collection.. check out Elements of life.... on da real"
3,Interesting and enlightening,"Well researched book on mind body healing - how far back in time did man connect the dots - that his body can heal certain diseases and conditions with the power of the mind? The Bible and other ancient texts are used to show that Jesus used the power of suggestion to ""heal"". Very interesting and enlightening book."
4,"An extreamly beautiful keyboard, But that infrared ?","I found this to be a most beautiful keyboard But at this point it stops. A very quite keyboard to use and the styling and weight is extreamly well thought of.But that Infrared has got to go, And the mouse is borrowed from the laptops which in my case is undesirable. If you are doing a lot of networking you may want to leave your mouse on the desktop. If you are doing much typing like word processing & spreadsheet work you may need a box of batteries handy. I love it's looks and style but it could be upgraded in these areas."
2,Pros and cons,"I bought this product because I wanted a cordless keyboard. This item is cute and small, built in mouse and number pad. The pros: Small, attractive, cordless, wonderful hot keys. Cons: The keyboard better be pointing towards the infrared box in close range (worse than a cheap remote!) the mouse takes time to get use too! (2 tiny buttons next to a micro joystick) The number pad is part of the key pad! (must press the FN key all the time)and worst of all the hot keys stopped working after 3 months! My friends at first say ""WOW"" when they first see it, but in minutes they start screaming ""I hate your stupid keyboard!"" ""A"" for effort, but ""D"" for performance!"
3,"WTF, Stars!?! make me as mad as you say you are.....","so i read the lyrics to this CD before i listened to it and found them to be emotional, passionate, and angry at times, exciting over-all. sadly, the music inspires little more than my desire to take a nap. dissapointing. i feel like they are singing about puff the magic dragon, rather than Revolution. even considering their genre of soft, dreamy ""indy-rock"", or whatever you want to call it, the emotion of the music does not live up to its lyrics. i do like the art on the CD. i think most people would find the picture of a revolutionary in a pink ski mask holding a mozeltov (sp???) cocktail more moving than the music, which plays like a bedtime story. is that what theyre going for? i really want to like them, i think i would like them as people, but i dont know, this CD just doesnt work for me. or maybe ive just had too much coffee......see for yourself."
1,Set the recording masters on fire,"I hate this album. I thought the female singer was Harriet Wheeler from The Sundays, alas it wasn't. There isn't a solid track on this cd. The whole thing is weak. I don't know for certain, but I'm guessing this is a band that was shepherded along by a A&R neophyte trying to cut his or her teeth ""discovering"" this ""unique"" outfit. This album reeks of preciousness, one that has no inspiration. See, in my estimation when a band puts out a record they need to be able to look each other in the eye and feel chills at what they've assembled. With this album, I envision everyone involved pretending (or just not knowing any better) that they'd created something ""transcendent"" or ""beautiful"". I would hate to have sat behind the mixing boards listening to this pap over and over and over again. Unable to flesh out something any good, they seem content to rely on ""flourishes"" and studio tweaks in hopes of making something worth listening to. Sad to say, but it fails miserably."
4,Continuous improvement,"I love this album. Felt that Heart was a bit patchy, but this is consistently good, with some obvious nods to the last 40 years of pop and rock culture. Hasn't been released in Europe to my knowledge, but would do well in the UK, I'm sure. Ageless Beauty could have come straight off a Delays album. Highly recommended."
5,Their Best Album So Far,"""Set Yourself On Fire"" is their best album so far. Plus it's one of the top albums of 2005 - that says a lot right there. They are also part of the Broken Social Scene group, along with Feist, Jason Collett, etc. The album has a good mix of slow and fast tracks (favourite ones including ""Sleep Tonight"", ""The Big Fight"" and ""Celebration Guns""). Also great to crank up on a cold night and sing along to. Something that is unique is that there are both female and male vocals which adds that special oomf to the album."
5,Rediculously Good,"Let me add my voice to the chorus of praise for ""set yourself on fire"". After one hearing of ""your ex-lover is dead"" on CBC radio, I tracked down this CD and haven't been happier. From start to finish, this third offering by the Stars is nothing short of masterful. I hadn't bought a CD in years before this one, and it is money well spent. It's important to support rising Canadian talent, so buy this album for yourself, then for your friends and loved ones. Support the Stars! We need more of their high quality music!"
4,Calendar girl,"I first heard Stars' song as my net friend sent it to me. It's called Calendar girl, the last song in the Set yourself on fire album. To me, their voice sounds pretty harmonious, and I am never tired of its lyrics. So later I decided to find out more information about the album. When I listened to the other songs from their website, my mood was smoothed by the comfortable melodies. And I really enjoyed their songs as well as the website they designed. According to the introduction, Stars is a band of the Canadian experimental musical collective Broken Social Scene (BSS). These days, I set myself on fire like the title of this album, and now I am in an endless circle. I cannot escape from their pop songs. I simply CANNOT and will not take this album out of my media player lists."
3,great product - bad distributor,Body Wrap No Wire Full Figure Bodysuit (45000)This product is wonderful. The fabric is soft and breathable. Take care when washing as underwire may eventually poke through. The only downside is Amazon's distributor: Her Room. This company has twice sent items that were flawed. Their customer service is beyond bad. It's too bad because Body Wrap is a great company.
3,Love with Willie,"It's always interesting to listen to Willie Nelson's `albums' that are his love songs. However this almost sounds as if the sound is muted, it's just not the normal clear voice of Willie Nelson - nothing wrong with his singing, it just sounds like a filter over the mike?My other complaint is that it only contains 10 songs. His version of Unchained Melody is wonderful as is hearing him sing Some Enchanted Evening. I just wish there was more for my money here.Songs included are; Something, I Can't Begin to Tell You, To Each His Own, What a Wonderful World, Always on My Mind, Unchained Melody, My Own Peculiar Way, If My World Didn't Have You, Some Enchanted Evening, wind Beneath My wings."
4,it is a sturdy cart,I like this cart... it has crappy directions so be for warned. other than that its just as pictured. Security is lacking so this is not theft proof. Users can see into locked area made of plastic.over all.. Recommended
4,work station,"It was a little tough to build but it was very functional for what I needed it for.the drawers are solid and its nice to be able to lock it up when neededoverall, a great workbench"
2,Not as good as its rating,"Garbage. Directions look as if they are for a previous model. Poor powdercoating is peeling off. Two different sizes of locking nuts - metric and sae. Not that surdy. Decent wheels and drawers. I would not recommend this product to anyone. When are we going to wise up and start making decent products in America again! Many screws are bad and metal frames are bent on tips. Look at the picture to assemble the wheels, not the directions."
5,"3-Shelf, 3 Drawer Work Cart",The Work Cart is handy and strong. It did take some time putting it together. The casters roll very smoothly. I feel that this cart is at least as good or better that the Craftsman cart.
5,Great Country Songs,Purchased this album for my collection - favorite songs to be installed on cell phone and smartphone micro data cards. Received the item by delivery and in good it in good condition. No flaws evident while playing the album.
4,SONGS HE GREW UP ON,"ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE FIRST FEW SONGS ARE A BIT HOKIE FOR THIS GIRL, ELVIS'S RENDITIONS OF 'GENTLE ON MY MIND', 'PLEASE RELEASE ME',AND 'ALWAYS ON MY MIND' ARE ENOUGH TO BRING A TEAR TO YOUR EYE. HE SINGS TO YOUR COUNTRY SOUL."
4,Just a good 'ol country boy at heart,"Before it was rock'n'roll, it was country. This is the first-ever documentation of Elvis' interpretation of the Southern musical backdrop he grew up in. In his first public appearance in 1945 at the age of ten, he sang Red Foley's sentimental 'Old Shep'; at his last recording in Graceland in October '76 the final number was 'He'll Have To Go'. Both songs are included here.Other tracks on the album feature compositions by Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and include some of ""the greats""--'Your Cheatin' Heart','From A Jack To A King', 'Funny How Time Slips Away', 'Always On My Mind', 'Guitar Man', plus never before released recordings of 'There Goes My Everything', 'Green Green Grass of Home', 'Just Call Me Lonesome', 'Help Me Make It Through The Night' and 'Fairytale'. The combination here is irresistable."
4,You've just got to read it!,"I love this book! The journey of the beautiful Dawn Treader enthralls me every time I read of it. I especially love one of the islands, where the youngest child, Lucy is tempted to perform a spell on her sister, Susan, out of envy. Will she succumb to the temptation? Sorry, you'll have to read the book."
5,An awesome voyage,"I really liked this Chronicle of Narnia becasue this one was in many different settings, not just Narnia, it was in a boat. They were looking for the seven lost sailors.It was fun to follow along on their voyage through the seas unexplored. I liked the characters, too. I also liked how they found different people and animals. The way they found the sailors not on one island but on many was very nicely done."
5,"Glory, honor and adventure","This one is a little different from the other books because it seems rather episodic in style. But that's understandable, seeing as they are voyaging from one island to the next. The overall impact is still a satisfying one: true adventure and glory, all the quirks of people included. The ending is worth the read."
1,Kindle Version Audio Excerpts Only!,"The Kindle ""audio"" version contains only minute and a half excerpts from the full audio, which if you want it, is some $25 in audio books (five and a half hours). Probably the audio is too large a file size for the Kindle delivery, but one would never know from reading the description that it was only excerpts."
3,The Longest Journey,"This is book five of the ""Chronicals of Narnia"" series and our writer never fails to keep the excitement going on.Although that aspect of fun and dance does not even come close to the books Salvatore wrote, namely ""The Icewind Dale Trilogy"" and ""The Legacy of the Drow"" and any other of that authors writings it is still an exciting book, but meant for younger ages.The writings continue with some adventure, there isn't ever too much action, except in some of the different battles throghout the book. It is more keeping people in suspense about what is going to happen next.I would recomend this book to younger peoples, but some of the older ones might find it interesting too."
5,5 out of 5 stars,"the best book ever !!!but, i think you shoud read the other 4 books in the seres befor this 1."
4,Good for younger Teenagers,I think that the book in question is another expedition to the tales of which C.S. Lewis was so good at telling. I highly recomend it and hope that all of you that read this book will experience the same true feelings of adventure that I felt.
5,Great story for young and old,"This is the best of the Narnia series but anything by C.S. Lewis is worth reading, especially his books on faith."
5,My favourite Narnia book,"This is my favourite book in the Narnian chronicles. It is justas strong and affirming as the others, but the places and stories areunusual ly beautiful and will definitely capture your imagination. The book leaves you with a sort of shimmering feeling at the end and you'll want to read it again and again."
5,Wonderful!,I re-read this before watching the movie. So glad I did. All the Narnia books are keepers and they are going to be permanently housed on my new Kindle.
5,The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,This book is full of surprises! When I wanted to stop reading I couldn't. This book painted pictures in my head. I read this book over and over again and never get tired of it. This book is a book for all ages! If you haven't read the series(including this book) don't waist your time.get the series today.
5,Wonderful book,"This was a very good book, one of my favorites in the series. I like how each time they visit a new place the story is broken up. I recommend this book but also read the other books in the series to understand this one more."
2,the voyage of the dawn treader,"The Book the Voyage Dawn Treader is a book I wouldn't recommend. I didn't like the Voyage of the Dawn Treader because there wasn't enough action for me, but I did Iike the character Reepicheep he was courageous and brave. The main idea of the book was that Caspian wanted to find the seven lords. I think that there were many differences between the movie and the book. The main characters were Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, Caspian, Reepicheep, Drinian, and Aslan. I thought the Dawn Treader was a very boring book. I didn't think the characters were believable. There was a part of the book that I did like and that was when the monopods came to get Lucy to make them visible again. I did like the way the story ended. At the end I liked how Aslan told Lucy something that made her happy but the sad thing was that Aslan told Lucy something that upset her."
5,Powerful story,"What a powerful story of two people who meet under circumstances beyond their control. I love the lady reverand. She's touogh and compassionate all at the same time. The police chief was a good characterization too, and their chemistry was excellent. Loved the story."
1,"Started off good, but fell apart","This is actually a pretty good mystery, and the woman Episcopal priest is also pretty good. The problem I had was that she then threw in a romance novel, and it all fell apart. Maybe it sells books for her, but it didn't fit.And there was no redeeming writing."
3,It's all about the adultery....,"These books are very clever and full of authentic detail but the major premise is wrong, wrong, wrong: a priest is having an affair, albeit unconsummated, with a married man. That is NOT a sub-plot. That is the major plot that carries on from book to book. It works no doubt, but it's basically a sleazy hook. These are the people we care about, not the murderers and the murdered. So these books are really about adultery, not about murder mysteries. JSF is an engaging writer but.... a sleazy subject."
3,Not That Great,"I just finished reading Out of the Deep I Cry, and I must confess I don't understand why all the rave reviews. Why all of the hoopla? This was an average read for me. . . nothing that exciting. Don't get me wrong, the storyline was all right, and I kept reading it instead of setting it aside, but I definitely can't quite get as jazzed over it as all the other reviewers. I may read another by this author, and I may not. I have to agree, adultery does not make a good subplot - especially when one of the protaganists is a priest."
2,Boring.,I really tried to give this book a chance but gave up after about four chapters. The writing was just plain boring so the characters held no interest to me.
4,"Fun, light reading","This is not a great intellectual journey, but I enjoy the characters. I particularly like the emotional struggle the two main characters are experiencing over an obvious physical and emotional attraction that violates their principles.I also find the author evidently wants to explore some issues that have been causing some upheaval in churches--homosexuality, same-sex marriage.Worth the price, but not a favorite.kittynix"
3,Not For Entertainment,"I base ratings on entertainment value and importance of the subject/ability to cover the important subject. All of this is relative of course. This book covers an important subject - one which I am thoroughly familiar with as a depressed and medicated person. Its not an entertaining subject. When you are completely sick of depression, being depressed etc. you are totally bored with yourself and throughly sick of it and of life. This book expresses that very well. It expresses the crazy need for relief from that state. But I think many books have already covered it. I wondered if the author would have anything new to say - she doesn't. How many times will somebody want to write a book and express the thoughts and feelings we all have? Not too many more I hope."
1,Not impressed,"I was interested in the subject matter and in the experiences related, but the intensely graphic profanity caused me to put it down. I firmly believe writers should be able to express their experiences, viewpoints, and thought with much better adroitness. Resorting to a profane, vulgar vocabulary such as this book contains is a cop out and teaches teens and others to think this vocabulary is acceptable, when it is teaching only a lack of ability to express themselves properly using better command of the english language. I was not only disappointed, but offended. I wouldn't recommend the book."
1,literary dribble,"Prozac Nation was the worst book I have ever read. It is 300 pages of her complaining about how horrible her life is. Being a Harvard and Yale Graduate, winning the Rolling Stone college journalism award, studying abroad in England, and having lots of friends would depress anyone. I doubt she is depressed, and is using her ""disorder"" to do be rude, and blow off her birthday parties, get drunk, and be a generally awful person.She is more a narrasistic self-asorbed attention seeker,then a suffering artist. The eplouge is the most offensive part of the whole book, where she compares herself to Kurt Cobain, and talks about how everyone else who is using Prozac is a ""poser"" and how she is the only one depressed enough to use is. What a load of crap."
2,Not that great,"I admit that I'm not a writer, nor have I ever claimed to be. To me, this book just seemed to drone on and on and on. One hundred pages into the book I basically felt the exact same need to slit my wrists as after the first paragraph. This girl had (or has) a mental illness. I understand that. I knew that going in, but geez! I didn't ever get to the plot, if there was one. Really, I don't understand why the book was as long as it was. Wurtzel drags the reader into the depression with her. Who wants that? If I wanted to be depressed, I'm positive I could find my own reasons. Books are something I read to take my mind off of everyday life - to get away from the ho hum. I couldn't finish reading this book. Eventually I dreaded opening it, to the end effect of altogether avoidance of this book (yes, like the plague). Thankfully, someone already purchased my used copy."
3,well......&%&*^%E,"I don't think it's appropriate to criticize an authors memoir, however...it is confusing as to what audience Wurtzel is trying to reach. Her writing is arrogant and confusing. In fact, at times, I thought her use of vocabulary really doesn't even make sense. Her thoughts are not original, it's the writing of a depressed young women in today's world. SO for all those who are mystified by her uniqueness, I'm sorry to dissappoint you, it's her illness that she speaks openly and honestly about and this, and only this is what gives her the gift of a story to write. I'd imagine it would difficult, if not impossible for someone who iis suffering from a similar illness to fully comprehend what Wurtzel is trying to convey in her writing, not to mention that anyone with this illness just wouldn't have the attention span to sit down and try to decipher her vocabulary while still comprehending the storyline."
2,Trite,"After forcing myself to finish this book, it still didn't redeem itself. The book was self-indulgent and whiney. I felt very little pitty for the auther. I, too, am depressed. I am also a self-injurer. There is a plethora of better books on such subjects. The subtitle of this book should have been ""Young, Depressed, and Whining."""
1,gag,"Summary: Wurtzel is very special. Her feelings of suffering are deeper and more justified than yours. Therefore,she should not be held responsible for any cruel and irresponsible acts she commits.I am grateful I do not know Wurtzel personally.Bless her for never procreating."
2,Good Vocabulary In This Book But Otherwise Alot Of Self Centered Whining,This book was great for building my vocabulary. Had a dictionary in one hand and the book in another.Other than that just a spoiled girl whining about her life.
3,Decent account of Depression,"Maybe it was bad timing on my part to have read this novel when I did. Having already been treated for major depression for years, I feel pretty good these days and when I decided to check out the novel Prozac Nation.As a depression sufferer I find it a fascinating topic and love to hear other people's stories but my goodness, was (is?) Wurtzel messed up! It was borderline too difficult for me to read at times because like I said, I feel pretty good these days and reading about Wurtzel's experiences brought back a lot of bad times.But all this is on me. The truth is she describes the illness about as perfectly as possible. I have no doubt that if I had found my way to this book during my really dark period it would have been something holy to me. Whenever trying to explain my feelings I'd just hand people a copy of the book and say,""Here! Read this.""Unfortunately I didn't find it then."
4,completed the book in a day .... that in itself says it all.,"Prozac Nation( I am giving a simple outline) 1st 100 pgs -- I say, ""Quit your whining!"" 2nd 100pgs -- I say, ""Quit your crying ! "" The rest is very interesting and entertaining ....-- Final Thought -- good justification in the end...Overall quite enjoyable ... and gained satisfaction that I had completed the book in a day .... That in itself says it all."
1,Self-centered piece of work,"I'd been wanting to read this book for quite some time, but couldn't make it through. It's the literary equivalent of masturbation. She has nothing insightful or meaningful to share, she just wanted to whine to the public. What a waste of time."
2,Too Self Absorbed,"Elizabeth Wurtzel's book ""Prozac Nation"" could also be called ""Oh Poor Me."" For the first half of the book, I was entranced in what this woman was dealing with. As a survivor of depression myself, I could really feel what she was going through. But page 300, I felt like curling up in the fetal position and crying. I understand that her depression was ""atypical"", but enough's enough. I just couldn't deal with what she was saying anymore, it felt so repetitive and self absorbed. She would have been better off taking out a couple chapters, so that maybe she could keep her readers better entranced. Like I said, Wurtzel's had a rough life....but no more rough than some people I know."
1,Depression? No Personality Disorder,This person has no idea what depression is. What you will find is that Wutzel has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. With severe depression you are completely socially isolated and have no desire to interact with anyone. Read the silly Book and saw the crap Movie.
5,Amazing!,"The other reviewer has no understanding of depression. However, the author has an amazing one. I love how she so clearly grasps what it's really like to inside the mind of teenage depression. Great book if you want to understand how it truly feels and how a depressed teen really thinks."
5,"eye-opening, packed full of insight into depression","This book hit home for me as I have a loved one who has gone through a terrible ordeal with depression which was brought on by the recently diagnosed, but long-term problem of Social Phobia. For anyone who is dealing with a friend or loved one who would like to gain insight into the thoughts and feelings of the person going through this pain, I highly recommend this book. Depression and other similar problems are so hard to understand when you are not the person going through it. It is hard to fathom that the things going through the persons head exist when you cannot feel or understand them yourself. I can relate and empathize so much more concerning the feelings and pain my loved one has been through from reading this book. Thank you Elizabeth, first of all for having the guts to write this book, and for the help you have given me (and I know a lot of other people as well)."
5,"Thank you, Elizabeth Wurtzel!","I read this novel during my worst period of depression when I was diagnosed and started taking Prozac. I was relieved to know that I wasn't alone in my loneliness and fright. Elizabeth Wurtzel had been there. Just seeing what I was going through in someone's autobiography took away some of my fright. I loved this novel and recommend it to young college girls suffering from depression especially if they go to school in Cambridge! The war on depression can be won especially with a great psychiatrist, medication, and a willingness to get better."
2,At first I thought it was just me...but this book really is CRAP!,"I had wanted to read this book for a long time (hoping to find something relating to my own troubles). I'm only a third of the way through the book and the nagging thought of ""wow this girl is really spoiled? self absorbed? whiny?"" was at first just a blip and now it is so apparent that I just am going to give up on this one. I hate giving up on a book but if I have to listen to any more of her dribble I think I will fall into another depression. (PS. A scathing review was posted by her very own Alma mater, Harvard. Google it!)"
2,Depressing and Slow,"I have recently been enjoying reading nonfiction including memoirs and biographies. This book was a little disappointing to me, but maybe I had the wrong expectations. The book is about the authors life, living with depression. Every page was the same as the page before. She was sad and depressed and couldn't get out of bed, and then would become manic and try to get better, then it was back to being sad and depressed. It was a very slow read. It took me a week and a half to read when I normally read a book in three to four days. I will say that if you want to read about the day to day life of a severly depressed girl this is the book to read."
5,For every person who has experienced Depression,"It so important for anyone who has been through Depression to read this book. Wurtzel's descriptions of it sound so very like my own journal entries of three of my four years in college fighting desperately for my own sanity. Depression forces a profound want beyond words, yet its victims have zero capacity to think, hope and express feelings (because there are none). A dead will and an empty spirit are its manifestations. I am happy and relieved that Elizabeth Wurtzel has given voice to a disease that is so prevelant yet so private and lonely for each person who experiences Depression."
5,Could this prove therapy in itself?,"What makes this one of the most brilliant pieces of prose ever publisher, is not its linguistic beauty, nor the seduction of the narrative - it is quite simply one the most uplifting books I have ever read. This may sound odd, but as a sufferer from severe depression, this book did for me what Prozac could not. It provided a wholly rational account of my irrational situation. The feeling of empathy moved this young man to tears. Quite stunning!"
3,a good book although a bit long winded,"I bought this book out of meny recomenditions, It was a pretty good book do to the fact it did have alot depression but it got pretty lame listening to her whine about boyfriends and what not.Basicly it read like a teenage girls diary."
3,"Sobering, then tedious. Triumphant...at your expense.","The title suggests a larger commentary than what is actually delivered. Perhaps better: Wurtzel's Word on the World of Wurtzel. In the absence of properly managed expectations brews deceit.As evidenced in existing reviews, this book provides hope and perspective for a fragile audience in need. For that, I applaud Wurtzel. To those of us unencumbered with depression, the essence of this piece can become tantamount to a cattle call for the grandest pity party in existence. This book's tone grows annoying, the effect threadbare as chapters eek along. Her summary prologue comment of, ""Great, that's the effect of depression"" is convenient and impotent.Where's the triumph if medicine was her ultimate savior?"
4,"Powerful, Sad, Desperate","Prozac Nation is a graphic account of how the author dealt with depression. At times, she comes off as self absorbed, but in these chapters, a reader gets a good understanding of how depression destroys not only the life of the person, but also that of the people around them. Most people would probably not be able to relate to Elizabeth. From the time she is eleven, she in caught up in her misery and nothing changes until she finally goes on medication. Even then, she's just able to cope better. I would still recommend this book, however. She literally shocks people into understanding her feelings. She was truly ""full of promise"" at a young age and her story of how she dealt with the inconsistencies of her life was fascinating."
2,why on earth?,"i cant really fathom why on earth Wurtzel would want to write this book. unfortunately she is so irritating that you get bored of her really quickly; shes not some friend of mine in trouble, shes a bint who wrote a book which sold very nicely. we may all slit our arms but we dont write a memoir in the blood. i felt sorry for those who were close to her and felt helpless, they couldnt put down this book and go do something more interesting instead."
1,The writing is unbearable!,"Though Wurtzel may have a story to tell and a few good points to make, I can't tell you all that much about it. Written in the tone of an adolescent girl gossiping with her friends, it is rambling and becomes irritating to read. It is filled with terrible metaphors, excessively long sentences, and reflective passages that completely miss the mark. There are times when I can almost hear Wurtzel speeding up and shrieking in the background... completely unenjoyable."
4,A brave book!,I think Wurtzel does a fabulous job in showing the non-depressed person what its like to be depressed from the inside out. Once i started the book I was absolutely hooked (partly because i had a book review due the next day in my General Psychology class) but at any rate I think it was completly gutsy to expose herself like she does- sacrificing herself on the alter of truth.
4,Interesting,"i first picked up this book at a used book store because alot of people old me it was great, and i was pleasantly surprised. this book is not light reading, but interesting and at times humerous. definatly recommended."
4,Elizabeth reminded me a lot of myself,A lot of people say that ant-depressant's cause suicide and I some how disbelieve that because of this book . If your going to committee suicide then your going to committee suicide the anti-depressants just give you the ambition to commit it.Even if your not depressed by reading this you get in the mind of a depressed women where actions are spontaneous and crying is frequently.I loved this book and i recommend it to everyone hopeless and to anyone who feels thier the only one going through depression this book helps....
4,"Poignant, thought provoking...","I would recommend this book to anyone who is suffering from depression or knows anyone who has. I thought that it really gave a clear picture of how someone who is depressed is feeling. Although I could not personally relate to Elizabeth Wurtzel, I knew someone close to me who was diagnosed with major depression and it is a difficult disease to understand if you have never suffered from it. I praise Elizabeth for having the courage to write about and share her painful experience with us. I also appreciated the authors note at the end of the book which gave some insight into depression and how it relates to popular culture."
3,I can't believe she is still alive!,"Wurtzel's book is a difficult one; it is self indulgent and in some ways rambling. But as the author says, it's supposed to be. The life of a bi-polar or manic depressive person IS self indulgent and rambling. However, I would say reading the almost mundane details of her life (mundane in the extreme) can sometimes be aggravating to the reader. However, her insites with her own disease and the disease of other's are quite profound. She does not think medication is a cure all but also knows it is necessary. Quite an eye openeing book for the uninitiated."
4,Excellent observations of the depressive mind!,"Prozac Nation is an honest memoir about depression among youths in America. It is told with a great deal of poignancy, but it also has a sardonic edge. Having experienced depression during my teens, this book hit home. The descriptions of how the mind of a person with depression works is rather disturbing -- and Wurtzel does an excellent job in delving into the every aspect of the mental illenss. I recommend this fascinating book most highly!"
5,Phenomenal,"One of the best books ever written about being young, bright, beautiful, and at times, crazy. It definetely belongs with the classics on depression such as The Bell Jar. Ms. Wurtzel elucidates what it really feels like to lose your mind while everyone else thinks you're just being selfish. I would not only recommend this book to anyone who has suffered from depression, but anyone who has watched a loved one slowly disintegrate for no known reason. Ms. Wurtzel is able to explain how the thoughts that everyone has eat away and dominate those who suffer from depression in a way few writers have done. Just a great book."
1,The cult of whine,"Well Lizzie: Wonder what you would have done just a mere 60 years ago, when the nation had not been saved by WWII. What would you have done before the transcontinal RR was built, and if you wanted to get to San Francisco, one walked or if rich, rode on a horse or mule? The problem with today's younger generations is that they have no concept of history and what it took to stay alive, just a few years ago. This not the Age of Aqurius, but rather, The Age of Whine. The cult of someone did to me and it is not my fault, is in accendance. Don't waste time on this one!"
1,"If you are depressed, don't read this book!","When I first read this book, I was in high school struggling with depression and I thought that reading about someone else's struggle would help me. In this case I was wrong. I found the book extremely pessimistic and hopeless. This is not the kind of thing you want to be reading when you are in the midst of a full blown attack of the hell that is depression. It will only make your world darker and more frightening. It is however, an interesting book if you can detatch yourself from it. I wasn't able to do that."
2,EW is so unimpressive...,"OK, so what's her deal? Why does she think she's SO different (special) from either other depressives, other New Yorkers, other women in general, other Ivy League graduates, etc.? What has she really written about that has any solid, concrete information? Prozac Nation has already been written in the diaries of like 3 billion other young women in America, but you don't see them publishing their diaries and glorifying their pathologies. She SO did not ""expose depression as an epidemic in our country."" She merely published her diary and attempted to create an illusion of authority and superiority and heroism. The book should really be a case history not for depression, but for narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders. Get over yourself already!"
2,Have Pity on Me,"That's about the only message Prozac Nation conveys. Elizabeth Wurtzel somehow deviates from the problems of depression vis a vis, and deviates to all sorts of tangents. Everything always leads back to her. I'm sorry, but she must have been PMSing something fierce to come up with this excrement. Sure she has a verbose lexicon, and knows how to arrange words fluidly to make it appear as if she's saying something meaningful, but as far as I'm concerned she fails miserably. I however am only reading this book because it's required for a college course. Would I recommend this for a peer? Simple and short, the answer is no. If you enjoy the mindless, self-indulgence of a rich Jewish girl who manages to hyperbolize every dramatic event in her life, then I recommend this book for you. If you have an IQ above that of an inanimate object, then don't even skim through the pages."
2,Get me outta here,"Gutsy and confronting, yeah, but I hated it. Elizabeth Wurtzel revealed herself as stuck in depression but also whiny, attention-seeking and spoilt. This makes it a very unenjoyable read. Her mother gets assaulted and her immediate thought is something like I can't believe this is happening to me! And sure, taking a minor overdose is worrying, but don't call it a suicide attempt if you know it's not going to kill you. She does admit that she doesn't know how to be a grown-up and that was how I saw it too: it was hard for me to feel for her or her depression when she revealed herself in an unsympathetic way.A good writer makes you feel things, good or bad, sure. But I read on WikiP that after her second book got poor reviews she became a drug addict ... so she could write another book about how hard things are. This gets little sympathy from me, which is a shame because these are topics we all need to be aware of and emotionally intouch with. 2 stars."
2,"Try ""Darkness Visible"" or ""The Beast"" instead.","While Wurtzel does provide a couple relatively decent insights, this is a long drawn-out memoir about a manipulative, deceitful and narcissistic individual. While depression may be one component of her disease, her psychological problems are (or were) many and varied. Other human beings are only useful to her when they can provide drugs, money, sex, and a shoulder to cry on (which is every minute of every day). If they couldn't provide these things they they weren't worth knowing. People interested in learning more about depression should check out ""Darkness Visible"" by William Styron and ""The Beast"" by Tracy Thompson."
4,great book to read if you're depressed,"I just finished reading this book and all I have to say is that she describes depression to the tee. I've never had so many ""that's exactly how i feel!"" moments then when reading this book. Although at times she may get annoying and whiny I think that it is worth getting through the book, especially if you suffer from depression."
1,a disservice to depressed people,"Personally, I am not convinced that Elisabeth Wurtzel suffers from depression. I am not a mental health professional, but have have a degree in biology and have read extensively on the topic. Sure, she has depressive symptoms, but her main problem appears to be more in line with a personality disorder, borderline or narcissistic. That would best explain the superficial charm, grandiosity, self-senteredness and erratic projections of anger that are evident in the book, as well as her chaotic lifestyle choices over the years. She is doing disservice to bona fide depression by promoting a stereotype of depressed people being whiny and self-centered. I think it is pretty outrageous that she is now a poster child for this condition, and actively promotes exclusively pharma-based treatments to impressionable young adults. The writing itself is terrible, sloppy and pretentious. Don't waste your time on this book."
4,A view into the realm of the depressed,I loved this book this girl is a genius.. This book delves into the mind of a very depressed human being. I think this book is great for someone with depression or for someone who knows someone with depression.
1,Someone Please Slit My Wrists..,"A novel has to be really bad for me to not finish it. I just do not get why there seems to be a cult following for this snore of a book. Yeah, so you're depressed Wurtzel, get over it. Who really cares? I got the impression of a spoiled little brat, who thinks she's more wonderful than she is and is pissed off that the world doesn't bow down to her. Get over yourself. It was painful just to turn the page. It was that bad."
2,On and on and on,"Im not making light of depression (have personal and professional expirience), but come on already. The entire book was a reiteration that she was a sick little brat. On and on and on. Thats it. One reviewer said she was obviously BPD, and I have to say I felt the same thing while reading it."
3,"A little drawn out, but worth the read.","While never having suffered clinical depression, this book was an eye-opener. I found it very insightful into the world of the depressed. I did, however, feel the book was a bit self-absorbed and drawn out. I don't know if it seems self-absorbed because depression is indeed a problem with one's self, or that she was just a winey brat. The book also seemed drawn out but, in a way, that went to prove the point that depression doesn't just go away on it's own. It is something that stays with a person, and is seemingly a constant stuggle. I would recommend this book for someone with a lot of patience, and who is interested in a good story (that i'm sure many can relate to)."
5,Elizabeth Wurtzel is a heroin,"Eliabeth Wurtzel is like my sister, guiding me threw my depression.Her book shows me that i can over come this depression, that keeps growing inside me like a virus. I would just like to say to Elizabeth, where ever you are I thank you for putting this novel together. If anything in the world this book has shown me, that I have a chance to succeed."
4,helpful to a parent,"As a parent, and as a teacher, it is continually disturbing to see the growth of depression-like illnesses. To me, this book helps gives me understanding, and perspective. It is one of a few on the topic I have obtained. I don't necessarily agree with all the authors views, but the topic is so disturbing even to professionals, I do recommend this for those in search of help."
1,"Poor me...Poor, poor, poor little me.","Yikes. Someone needs to tell this woman that there's more to writing a story than producing a handful of cosmetically attractive sentences. There are plenty of lines in here, that if taken on their own might fool someone into thinking they came from a great book. But take them all together and the story comes up as empty and shallow as Ms. Wurtzel herself. I gave 'Bitch' a chance too, but it also failed to impress. Perhaps these books read better when you're thoroughly medicated, but to me they amounted to nothing more than an indignant whimper from a spoiled little girl. Boo hoo. Sorry Liz, but you're no Dorothy Parker."
3,Wurtzel Nation,"I feel this book does not really live up to the considerable hype it has received. It loses one star for the misleading title. A more appropriate one would be ""Wurtzel Nation"" or, like one other reviewer suggested, ""Listening to Wurtzel"", since it's mainly just one long soliloquy. It loses another star for being fairly boring. In spite of these shortcomings, I still think it's worth reading, especially if you're suffering from depression. The young woman has a strong voice, whether or not it's the voice of a generation, and it should be heard. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
4,A must-read,"Eizabeth Wurtzel's memoir seemed very trivial to me at first. I am not a child of divorce so I have no idea what caused my depression. But as I read further, I found her putting words to feelings that I myself have had and have been unable to express to many people. I think that anyone who is living with, or knows someone suffering from depression needs to read this book. If only to get an idea of how it really feels when that black wave washes over you."
3,I couldn't finish it.,"I just could not finish this book. I was well above page 100, and it was the same droning on and on about the same stuff. I thankfully don't suffer from depression and my heart goes out to those who do, but damn, girl! You could have cut to the strength and hope a bit sooner. In fact, I think the book may have been making ME feel depressed. But Wurtzel is not in bad company here; reading Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment did the same thing to me and I couldn't finish it, either. Perhaps it speaks for the books' realism. I hope she got help. Depression seems like a horrible disease to be striken with, and I know I wouldn't be able to keep going if I suffered from it."
5,Review on Prozac Nation,"I thought this was a great book, in that it describes in great detail experiences depressed individuals have to go through.I understand completely where Elizabeth Wurtzel is coming from, because I too have been battling with depression. Although at times Wurtzel goes off on a tangent, I think she clearly describes clinical depression. Wurtzel also happens to be a great writer, at any rate, this is a great read. I definitely recommend you to take a glimpse at the life of a depressed individual through the eyes of Wurtzel."
3,A Great Book with lots to offer,"I did enjoy reading Prozac Nation because I thought you got to see into Elizabeth's true feelings. By her detailing alot, besides the fact that this got people saying it was boring and dragged on, you really got to feel what she was feeling. Perhaps though the reason this book got three stars was that it wasn't anything special. I mean I read the whole thing and I really looked foward to opening the book, but it did possibly drag on too much. For people who are a tad bit deppressed though, this could give you some material, but also giving you some insight. So if you have free time, read it. It's a really good experience."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"I've had depression for years and this is not a work on depression. It reads like an over emotional 14 year old girl's diary. If you want to put Wurtzel on a pedestal and worship her like a ranting & egocentric cry baby, then by all means, please see to it you organize a mass sucide or something. And take Wurtzel with you."
3,"like an addict, she thinks she's unique","I plowed through this book as I have a personal interest in depression. However, I found her to be a very dislikable person. She put friends and family through pure h@ll, yet wouldn't dream of being locked up in a psych ward.Once I got to the Epilogue however, I lost all respect. She seems to be suggesting that only she had the awful struggle with depression and there are just too many people on Prozac now. As if the rest of the people on prozac don't ""deserve"" it as much as she does.If she were my child, she would have been admitted to a psych hospital in her late teens and a lot of her misery (and the misery she put other's through) could have been avoided."
2,Rave reviews from high schools girls...,"and someone who describes her as a ""heroin"" - I'll leave you to your own conclusions...I also noted that most of the self described, depressed reviewers, who ranted about her tendency to go on and on about herself, managed to do the very same thing in a much smaller space.Still, she's not bad on the eyes..."
2,"Pity me! Oh, please...","Elizabeth Wurtzel's writing can, at best, be described as tragically poetic. At its worst, self-indulgent and obnoxious.While the book itself contains a reasonable amount of analysis of one woman's struggle with depression, one walks away with a bad taste in one's mouth."
3,Slightly Above Average,"Elizabeth Wurtzel does a very good (but not great) job of relating her experiences with depression. Along the way, she touches on some very interesting facts (""500,000 heroin junkies can't be wrong"" hehe!) not to mention some very dark humor. The bad part of this book is that the end plays more like a Prozac ad than something of substance. For several pages she rambles on about how she was saved by Prozac and about how far ahead of other anti-depressants it is and exactly how it works. Now all that needs to come is the sequel where she's addicted to them and is affraid to get off. Trust me: I would know."
3,prozac filtration,"i think that this book could have been done a lot better. it was put together a bit sloppily, but it is a memoir, and if i am going to read something like that, i guess i can't judge too harshly. the parts in the book when the girl breaks down are good, it reminds me or myself and kc. but, otherwise it is slow and it feels like a tedious task. borrow it from a friend if you are desperate but don't buy it."
3,from a depressive's point of view,As someone who suffers from clinical depression I could easily relate to nearly everything she said to describe her feelings. But the book was sooooo drawn out. Elizabeth tends to ramble. So be prepared to get bored every once in awhile. Is it worth reading? yes but just remember not all depressive's are like her. We don't all break down in bookstores in London and talk about suicide so frequently but NEVER attempt to do it until we're about to get better. She gives a whiny aspect to her writing that I never expected even though I'd heard that's what her writing sounded like. She almost seems desperate to get worse instead of better. And as a depressed person i know that's not true. That's how she comes off though. So be prepared for some crazy stuff.
5,A true MUST-READER for all!!,"By far THE best book i've ever read in my entire 15 years of existance!! This book is so extremely true to life, and such a wonderful representation of how i feel every day! EVERYONE should read this book!!"
2,Eh.,"Much has been written about the overly self-involved author, but there is little debate that she is actually a very good writer. The problem with Prozac Nation is that while outlining the story of her descent into depression, she gets very wrapped up in grand soliloquy. This could have been pared down by at least 75 pages had she not so frequently gone off on tangents about society, womanhood, and armchair philosophy. That's not why I picked it up....Still, to her credit, her story rings painfully true to anyone who has ever suffered from Depression....."
1,The worst book I have ever read-,"and I have read a lot of books, so that's really saying something. Zero stars! Rambling, boring, self absorbed, obnoxious and almost impossible to get through. I couldn't have cared less what happened to the author-I just wanted this book to end. Trying to be deep and it's just the same old I hate life tripe. Elizabeth Wurtzel must be a painful person to know.**********UPDATE*********This is no longer the worst book I've ever read. I have read 50 Shades of Gray."
