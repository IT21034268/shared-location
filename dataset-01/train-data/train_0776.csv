4,Film Holds Up Quite Well,"I remember when ""About Last Night"" was originally released in 1986 it was met not with drawn knives by the critics but yawning disdain. This can probably be attributed to the derision the flacks held for stars Rob Lowe and Demi Moore. Viewing the film again for the first time in twenty-odd years it's safe to say that this is some of the best work Lowe and Moore have ever done. It helps when there is a decent script, based on a David Mamet play, to work with. The film explores the genesis of a relationship from the first blossom of love to it's ultimate breakup to a possible reconciliation. The film examines the forces that immolate a relationship from within and from the outside. The outside forces that scuttle Lowe and Moore's relationship are excellently represented by Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins whose rationales are less than altruistic. This film is timeless because it's themes exist outside the culture of the Eighties."
2,MAYBE A BAD COPY,"I got my Blu-Ray copy from Columbia House. I don't know if that makes a difference or not. The English Dolby TrueHD track does not read well. It reads between 1.1 and 2.0 Mbps when I should get a reading of about 1.9 Kpbs. Only the Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 track gives me a good reading. The French and Portuguese tracks are off as well. Even my A/V receiver reads Pro Logic instead of Dolby Digital with this disc. Could it be a fluke or did whoever authored this disc totally screw up? The movie itself is fine, but the technology on this particular DVD sucks."
4,"Cute, more mature brat-packer film...","I love this movie, too. I have been watching it for years. I finally got it on DVD. It was actually one of the first movies I bought on DVD. It's a classic piece of 80's history with some great lines and feel-good music. My favorite song is ""If Everybody Had a Heart"". Still gives me chills and I must have seen this movie over 400 times. Those were good times...great movie. ::thumbs up:: Plus, it's like, the first ""sexy"" movie I think I ever saw...:-p"
3,Corny,I'm watching this film for the first time in years and its just struck me how dated it looks. All that 80's gear ! Its classic 80's brat-pack stuff and probably the best of them but it hasn't worn too well. Rob Lowe & Demi Moore have as much screen presence as an empty crisp-packet but its harmless stuff anyway. I must be getting old...
3,An Old Favorite,This is an old favorite from my college days. I hadn't seen it in a while and watched it the other day and still really enjoyed it. It is a good story about dating and love and the complications that seem to always come with it. Jim Belushi gives excellent balance to Rob Lowe as his brutish crude buddy. This movie is still good and still holds up even today.
4,Classic!,I watched this again after reading the Rob Lowe autobiography -- which is great! -- and it was fun to watch.
1,Poor design,"A week after I purchased this reel, the spring loaded mechanism broke, and the cord would no longer retract. Being handy, I was able to take apart the mechanism, get a stronger spring and fix the reel. It works great now, but I would not expect a ""Professional"" series cord reel to break so relatively easily in my home garage. I would definitely not recommend this to a friend."
2,50 feet wire in a 40 foot reel,"50 feet is what I needed,but I didn't wan't to poke the last 10 feet in.4 more words. one."
2,Not Very Good,"Install was easy and looks good on the ceiling of my work shop, but failed to produce. Works ok with my sander and shop-vac, but can't handle my table saw. I attempted to run my small 1 1/2 HP table saw with it and the breaker popped.The length of the cord is nice, but the retractable reel is weak. I have to guide the cord back into the reel.Spend some extra cash and get an industrial grade reel."
4,"I can't agree with all his rankings, but I can't put it down","Whenever someone tries to rank the most influencial people of all time, there will be some controversy. I was surprised at some omissions, like Abraham and Da Vinci, as well as some of his rankings of major scientists over major political and religious leaders(Newton over Jesus and Buddha), but Hart was able to almost convince me why Newton was more important than Jesus. In only 4-7 pages a person, Hart gave all the essential information and more. My only quibble about this book is the lack of importance he gives to Jewish religious leaders like David, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, none of whom are ranked, while Christian and Islamic leaders who were equally important to the spread of their respective religions were ranked througout the list. Still a must read before the close of the millenium"
4,culture succumbs to politics and science,"A great, readable book. A page turner, succinct. the arguments as to why someone was selected are very thought out, cogent and clear.The bias against cultural figures is stunning though. Other than codified cultural systems, i.e., religions, the author obtusely dismisses artists as people who only influence other artists.While I disagree with this point, if it is a litmus test, fine, but then the inclusion of Bach? Ugh.An updated version with the inclusion of the dude who invented email needs to be released."
3,Good book but lacking,"I really enjoyed this book, some of the top 100 people are very interesting, but i question the mention of Thomas Edison with no mention of Nicola Tesla, are you kidding me, Tesla may have been Edisons assistant, but the invention DC power is a joke compared to Tesla's AC power invention. The world is run on AC power, radio's and flashlights are run on DC power, not very impressive. Look at some of Westinghouses patents and you will find several hundred invevtions that were tesla creations."
5,100 Questions,"The author has made judgements which are discusable. Not every reader will accept his valuation, but it's interesting to see his results.The only critic I have, was the very long deliverytime (more then 4 weeks for sending a book in the US is not acceptable). In Europe the deliverytime is less then two days for similiar costs."
1,unprofessional shipping,"This is a terrific book, but it was moronically packed with absolutely zero protective packing, merely placed in a thin paper envelope which got torn open, and the book was wrecked in the mail."
1,this book is so biased,"Jesus Chris is not the no. 1? Even our dating system is based on Chris, which influences everybody on earth."
3,Fascinating and great addition to the bookshelf,"This should definitely be on your bookshelf. Packed with fascinating information and saved me a great deal of thumbing through other books. In terms of biography(per se)it doesn't have the ability to reach the inspirational levels of something like ""THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard Patton, but then few books do. For the limited area it addresses Hart's book is a must."
5,Great Book,"My on-line review was given for the more latter version of this book and can be found there. I would just like to disagree with the ""history major"" and agree with the person who criticizes the critics. It is the history major who is biased. Jesus would never had become famous if it were not for the major contributor to the bible, who never met him, as Hart states. We all have our opinions, but as a scientist I would have ranked Isaac Newton number one (instead of two). If not for his discoveries there would be no technology, no medicine, no modern times. But this is not what made the book a good read, but rather the mini-biographies that were contained therein. Religous bias seems to drive the ""history major"". Keep studying."
2,EITHER the title OR the list should be corrected!!!,"After reading the book and the reviews below, I can say the following:- a huge effort has been put to write this book,- it is an insightful list,- the list is provocative,- the list is very subjective, biased, skewed, and should be taken with caution.- the list is full of impostors such as Gutenberg (instead of Bi Sheng), Lavoisier (instead of Geber), Marconi (instead of Tesla), Euler (instead of Al-Khwarizmi), even JFK for ""U.S. President who led first successful effort by humans to travel to another planet""(instead of Nikita Khrushchev who led the First Man in Space Yuri Gagarine), etc.Therefore, two solutions:1. Rename the book as: ""The 100: A Ranking Of The Most Influential Persons In WESTERN History"", or2. Gather a commission of world historians to establish an objective list.We know that ""History is written by the winners"" and Hart's book is just a reminder of Alex Haley's quote."
3,Jesus Christ Was the Most Influential Person Who Ever Lived,"I too believe that author Michael Hart errs in not recognizing Jesus Christ as the most influential Person who ever lived. No serious historian doubts the historicity of Jesus. Jesus Christ not only was one of the chief foundation stones of western civilization, but also influenced all other civilizations on this Earth.One reason that Hart gives for depreciating Jesus Christ is his position that the Apostle Paul was a co-founder of Christianity (p. 17). That, in my opinion, is ridiculous. Paul came after Jesus, and was actually an early follower of Jesus Christ. He did not develop anything new; he merely codified what he had been taught earlier. Without Christ, Paul would have remained Saul, a devout Jew and member of the Sanhedrin. Finally, none of the doctrines of the early Church depend exclusively upon Paul."
4,Good Book.....but JFK????,"My wife and I are really diggin' this book. Thank God the author did not write any more than he did about those old Chinese dudes or the chemists and scientists. 4 pages is enough for me regarding those boring guys. The writer does a great job supporting his reasoning for the ranking and stuff but I was really puzzled when JFK popped up. You gotta be kidding me? JFK? He got it for putting a man on the moon. Hey author dude!!! JFK basically just cut the check. Throw a bone to the guy that invented the multi-stage rocket in the 1920s? He is the one that got the ball rolling. The space race was huge (satillite tv, gps, etc...) but the MAN ON THE MOON????...so what! You can do better than that."
3,"Uh, the structure of DNA?","I admit, I've only read the Table of Contents. But, shouldn't James Watson and Francis Crick (and maybe Wilkins and Franklin) be on the list, considering some of the people that did make it. I mean the discovery of the structure of DNA and how it codes for genetic information has had a large impact on the world already."
4,it's okay,"In order to complete my plan of having ALL Robert Barnards books, I had to order this combination book. It's okay and arrived on time and so forth, but sorta blah as far as appearance. If you're a ""booker"" you won't be crazy over this but it'll do in a pinch to complete the set. LOL"
3,Mas o menos,"Medio bueno medio malo, lo cual quiere decir que la mitad de las canciones estan buenas y la otra mitad estan pesimas."
2,Mediocre,"Soy una gran admiradora de Miguel Bose, pero si he de juzgar su carrera en base a este CD, el pobre Miguel no sale bien librado. De las 15 canciones a dueto, solo tres valen la pena (Paulina Rubio, Alaska y Laura Pausini), las demas canciones fueron grabadas con una version tan diferente que se parece poco a la original (es lo que las hizo famosas inicialmente). Algunas de las canciones valen la pena, pero este es uno de esos CD's que habria sido mejor bajar del website de IPOD y escoger solo 3 o 4 canciones, el resto da flojera escucharlas. Reitero, me fascina me Miguel Bose."
1,rated x: no one over 18!,"My collection was missing Brasilian chicks so I bought this DVD. Warning: what you see on cover is what you see on DVD, nothing more.I was really surprized to see ugly young women without tits or any private parts for this matter. I guess this flick was done about 50 years ago, way before internet. Avoid."
3,Its just ok...,"I own this cd cause a friend told me they were just amazing...I disagree. I listened to it for awhile, tried to let it grow on me, but it just doesnt work...I'm not sure why. Neither does Fugazi for that matter.Everyone I know who likes Straight-Edge or Hardcore worships this band except for me...and then they get offended when I let them know this, but it is my opinion that these guys (and Fugazi) are over-rated. Download some before you buy it anyway, to make sure you're not wasting money as I did...(To Fred Durst's Numba One Fan - You're my fooking hero dude. I was falling out of my chair laughing as I read your reviews...my face is sore now:)"
5,Anyway: Buy this ...it's good!,"I have had CD since it came out in 1988 (or was it 87) and I have listened to sooo many times since I got it. I dont have the red cover I have the blue cover in which alot of my friends have tried to steal from me. This music really is something to listen to, songs like look back and laugh, in my eyes, good guys dont wear white and filler are some of amazing songs on this CD it has catchy lyrics and sounds."
5,Greatest CD ever,"Every single song written by the greatest man ever, Ian Mackaye, performed by the greatest band ever, Minor Threat. Even the kids that hate straight edgers love Minor Threat."
4,classic,"There should be no doubt about it, this band is classic. This band was one of the starters of hardcore, and Ian Mackaye is to hardcore/punk what Kurt Cobain is to grunge. The first 8 songs or so on this cd are definately their best material. They have influenced so many bands that its not funny. ""Straight edge"" is the anthem of the movement, and rightly so because its a great song. This cd is fun, get it."
5,The Album,"This is the album that I will always associate with the best times of my life. In no way did it ever let me down. The passion, intensity and sincerity of Ian MacKaye have only left positive influences on my life and these songs can conjur up emotions that only treasured memories of childhood can deliver. This album keeps me young. I will listen to it when I'm 67 years old and will still get shivers when I hear the last lines of Filler. Nothing has or will ever come close to Minor Threat. They were the once in a millenium combination of energy, talent and drive that spawned a 1,000 knock offs who will never fully understand."
5,What's left to say?,"Heck just read what other fans are saying, this album is great! Great punk rawk, and if you a true punk rawker, then you must get this now!!!"
5,Intelligent punk not for the average Joe,This is one of my Favorite alblums in my collection and also one of my most guarded (Along with my Fugazi collection). I rarely play this in the presence of people who dont listen to this type of music because they often dont understand it or they dont like it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a love for excellent yet often misunderstood music.
5,Well...,"You've got it all on this record; the fantastic Complete Discograph by Minor Threat (well, your missing the demo tapes, but you don't really need them)The CD opens with the blazing 'Filler' followed closely by the aggressive 'I Don't Wanna Hear It.' Most of the songs up to 'Steppin' Stone' are in this same style of angry, fast punk. The highlights of this section of the album are:'Straight Edge''Minor Threat''Out of Step (With the World)'However all the tracks from this section are unbelievably good.After this the album ""slows"" down somewhat; still fast, but a bit slower and less agressive. To the end of the album the highlights are:'No Reason''Cashing In''Betray''Salad Days'Really this album is among the greatest hardcore albums ever recorded. I don't know why your interested in hardcore and don't own this album; you must be insane or something.This album along with 'Bad Brains - Bad Brains' and 'Black Flag - Damaged' are the definitive hardcord records. So hurry up and buy them!"
4,one of the most misunderstood bands of all time,"a vision of youth and the perpetual societal objects of temptation that threaten to spoil it. naive, awkward and even sanctimonious (although they never attempted to indoctrinate), but musically tenacious and brutally sincere. raw, short songs that threaten to crumble apart at any moment. wild leadwork that sizzles over what was some of the fastest and most furious rhythm playing at the time. minor threat's stand-apart attitude was not for show; they lampooned the conformity and stagnant ideals of even the ""punk"" scene in which they could have more easily found solace, although that went over most people's heads."
5,Wow..,"these guys energized a scene filled with drugs and created a song that has become the term for the non-drug using subculture of punk ""Straight Edge."" Songs like ""In My Eyes"" are foreshadowing here,a life of service that Ian MacKaye is to be espousing in Fugazi who's ""Suggestion"" is a song many women admire.I'm never gonna forget my fellow people if I keep listening to this stuff..F yeah.."
5,Faster!!!,"This is probably my favorite hardcore album (besides various Misfits ones). These guys aren't the wimpy cristian striagt edge guys, they were real hardcore straigt edge. The music is some of the heaviest hardcore out there and i'd reccomend to any fan of the genre. Favorite Songs ""Minor Threat"" ""Steppin Stone"""
5,Straight Edges UNITE!,"A collection of their five recordings from 1980-1983, this anthology chronicals the complete history of Washington DC's Minor Threat. Released in 1989, six years after their disbandment, the album gives a look into the band, who are most famous for starting the sXe (straight edge) movement of punks who refuse to drink, do drugs, or have casual sex. They're also famous because of frontman Ian MacKaye, who would eventually go on to form the emu band Fugazi.From the first song ""Filler"", which is one of the hardest songs on the record, to the final song ""Salad Days"", it runs through songs of short (Straight Edge clocks in at only 45 seconds)to longer ones (Look Back and Laugh hits at almost 4 minutes) and also with covers of Wire's ""12XU"" and The Monkees' ""Stepping Stone"".All in all, this album is a classic showcase of the 1980s punk/hardcore scene. A must for any punk fan."
1,terrible,I was told that this group was one of the innovative punk groups. Terrible. Poor lyrics but what is worse is poor musicianship. One star. Sorry.
1,Makes me blush for all the wrong reasons,"Being politically 'right on' does not necessarily mean you have the talent to make great political and social music. Minor Threat are one of the bands that owe most of their 'popularity' to their legend and it has clearly proceeded them in this compilation of songs. Corny and sometimes embarassing lyrically and even poorer musically, it only shows they did not have the ability to scrape together any half decent tunes. It was not their forte but I suspect they didn't care. They were so earnest and it's all a bit twee listening to it so many years on ('Straight Edge' in 2005 sounds so blushingly adolescent). This compilaton is not any worse than most of the junk going around today, and to be fair the production values were never going to be great because that was never the point of making music. (...)"
1,THIS AINT HARD CORE,MY FRIEND LET ME BOROW THIS CD FROM HIM CUZ IM INTO HARD CORE HE TOLD ME THIS BAND IS HARDCORE BUT GUESS WHAT THEY AINT. THIS MUSIC IS LIGHT IT AINT HARD IT SONDS LIKE IT WAS RECORDED IN A CLOSET OR SOMETHING IF U WANT TRU HARDCORE CHECK OUT THA LATEST SLIPNOT CD OR SOME OLDER KORN AND LIMP BIZKIT.
5,defining hardcore,"This album is the predecessor to hardcore and should not be compared to modern day punk. Every hardcore band today uses elements of this formula , from frank, honest lyrics, to fast or staggered intros which slide easily into a pounding breakdown (note: slower part). Ian mackay did not establish straight edge with these songs. It was not his intent to start that movement as we know it today. He was simply sharing his views to those who wished to listen. Those who did hear may have gone to far, but they did establish a positive movement, which, like all things, can be taken to far. This is a landmark album. Once again it is hardcore and should not be mixed up with bands like NOFX, who try not to take themselves too seriously, and should be given credit for their own style."
5,Look nowhere else.,"I can't even begin to say what this band means to me! The first time I heard these guys, I was in awe. The intensity, the sincerity, and the aggression floored me. In my opinion, this is the most influential hardcore/punk band there ever was or ever will be."
5,Best Punk Band EVER!!!!!!!!!,"Raw, pure punk power comes from Ian & Co. I don't think anyone can yell quite like Ian. If you like Fugazi check out Threat(they are way cooler anyways) and if you like punk in general check out these guys, don't let the whole straight edge thing keep you from getting this album, it is for anyone and everyone. GET THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Why don't you own this already.,"Ok, forget the whole straight edge thing for a minute and just looked at Minor Threat for what it is... great punk rock. Actually the best, musically this record sets the bar for where other groups should aim. I think non straight edge kids dont give this a chance because they think it's not for them. This record is for everyone that feels like they don't fit and the world around them is going down the drains. It's raw, unclean, and would make alot of ""older folks"" shiver, but it sounds great to me. I think it's unpolished sound adds to it's classicalness and makes it timeless. I strongly believe that I will always listen to this record, even when I'm sixty."
5,Out of Step? Think Again.,"Like everyone else who has reviewed this album, I MUST give it a 5-star rating. Why? Because, to my mind, Minor Threat defines punk rock in a way that very few bands ever have...the Sex Pistols and Dead Kennedys being exceptions to that statement. Ian MacKaye's vocals are raw and primal, jamming whole phrases and occasionally entire sentences into two or three syllables. His honesty is apparent...even blatent. The lyrics are socio-political hardcore punk at its best, and they point us to a place where the soul of punk rock resides. Please...I urge any and all members of the human race to buy this album, or at least listen to it. And don't worry about Ian's unique vocal style obscuring the message...a lyric sheet IS included."
5,Essential Early 80's Hardcore,"I pretty much wrote this review to knock that fool kid who gave this album one star and had the audacity to reccomend ""older Thrice albums"" because they have ""skill"" and ""enegery"", which according to him minor threat lacks...yeah to knock him off of the main page. Well, simply put this discography is essential to any study of the roots of hardcore. And maybe the key to the importance of this band, for me, is the message. I was never SxE or anything, but album made me think about issues that I related to in Mr. Mckaye's lyrics. He was pist off, and the music matched his intensity and biting wit. This band had a skill that is basically non-existant in today's nu-emo/metal/hardcore, and that was excellent, simplistic, and congruent song writing."
4,Not all squares are even.,The product is great! I only have one comment. The squares are not all the same size. For us it does not matter but to others this may be a big deal. There is not a huge difference between the sizes but enough to notice if you are trying to line them up evenly on your wall. But the colors are fun & bright and look great on the wall.
5,PRETTY BABY'S ROOM,"THIS IS FOR MY VERY FIRST GRANDBABY - SO I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT! THIS DESIGN IS ONE THAT WE CAN USE IN HER ROOM AS A NEWBORN - AND THEN SHE WILL GROW INTO IT ALSO. IT CAN LAST A FEW YEARS BEFORE WE HAVE TO CHANGE HER ROOM TO ""LITTLE GIRL"" DECOR. I AM ALWAYS READY FOR LITTLE PEOPLE TO HAVE A PRETTY ROOM, IT THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM."
5,Outlines the key steps to reclaiming one's life and independence,"How To Get Over Him And Learn From Your Mistakes: A Survival Guide is a self-help guide for women survivors of harmful or abusive relationships, ranging from being with a disrespectful man to being with philanderer or a thief, or suffering criminal attacks or date rape. How To Get Over Him And Learn From Your Mistakes outlines the key steps to reclaiming one's life and independence, and how to identify a man who is looking only for sex or worse. Though the author is very religious and her devotion to God shows through, How To Get Over Him And Learn From Your Mistakes is not a religious instruction manual - it is about dealing with practical matters in the search for Mr. Right, and written expressly for women in need regardless of their religious background. Highly recommended."
2,Van Damme fans only...,"I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like ""Desert Heat."" If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away."
3,Van Damme is an Icon,"I now have respect for the icon that is Jean-Claude Van Damme. After miserable experiences in the past from watching his films, I have now pity for the man. He plays a suicidal man who rides through the desert searching for his soul and he actually acts! An Indian man helps him on his journey and he gets revenge on the men who stole his motorcycle. Finally, Van Damme has found a role that people can appreciate."
5,very great van damme movie,"first of all,i gotta say,i love the music at the begginning.and also the dialogue.it really has no plot,just a lot of action.it has no martial action except in the very end,but it was very humorous.the old guy in the red suit was very,very funny.get this movie even if u r not that much of a van damme fan"
1,THE WORST MOVIE THAT VAN DAMME HAS EVER STARRED IN,"A MAN SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST A GANG THAT STOLE HIS MOTORCYCLE. STRAIGHT UP PREDICTABLE AND UNDENIABLY BORING. VAN DAMME LOOKS SO TERRIBLE IN THAT BEARD, I HOPE HE NEVER DOES A MOVIE WITH HIS BEARD LIKE THAT AGAIN. THE MOVIE IS STUPID, THE PLOT IS SO LAME, AND THE ACTION IS SO BORING. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW A DIE- HARD FAN OF VAN DAMME COULD LIKE THIS! THIS IS A MOVIE THAT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE IN STORES. THIS DEFINITELY AIN'T WORTH ONE CENT OF ITS PRICE. IF YOU ARE A VAN DAMME FAN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. A WALK IN THE WOODS IS MORE EXCITING THAN THIS. IF THIS MOVIE REALLY DOES APPEAL TO YOU, THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW YOUR ACTION MOVIES TOO WELL."
3,OK Van Damme vehicle,"DESERT HEAT[Coyote Moon](USA - 1999)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalA disillusioned ex-soldier (Jean-Claude Van Damme) goes to the desert to commit suicide, but instead gets drawn into a small town plagued by thuggish drug runners.Van Damme's career continued its downward slide with this routine actioner, inspired by YOJIMBO (1961) and bolstered by violent set-pieces and a gallery of eccentric supporting characters (played by Pat Morita, Danny Trejo, Larry Drake and Vincent Schiavelli, amongst others). Tom O'Rourke's screenplay springs few surprises, but director John G. Avildsen (THE KARATE KID) keeps the pot boiling in between scenes of gunfire and hand-to-hand combat, and Van Damme strikes something of a god-like figure in his skintight vest and clinging jeans (it's doubtful he ever looked sexier than he does here). Undiscriminating action fans will lap it up, though it doesn't really amount to very much."
3,Worth Watching,"Certainly not the best Van Damme movie, but far from his worst. Those looking for martial arts action should skip this one, though the plot moves along quickly and includes plenty of gunplay.A movie for his fans only...."
2,okay movie to watch for the action scenes.,"the start of the movie was very vague in conveying to the viewers what eddie lomax's dilemma was and why he wanted to die. there was not much character interaction between eddie and rhonda, yet they became madly in love. pat morita's character was cute as an english gentlemen with a knack for wrapping corpses up in saran wrap. as a matter of fact, there was a variety of crazy characters to fill in the gaps. the whole plot of the movie, i suppose was how a small town got out from under the control of a family of bullies. except for the actions scenes, there could have been more to the storyline."
1,"Bootleg, buyer beware","This release is a bootleg. Digimon seasons 1, 2, and 3 never got western DVD releases. Only VHS releases. Be warned, YOU ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF!"
3,Digimon Season 2 Box Set,"Product ordered arrived in a timely manner. All discs except the next to the last dvd worked fine. The next to the last dvd in the set skipped, scrambled, and froze, making it unviewable. While considering reordering Digimon's Season 2 Box Set, when I do, I make sure and keep my receipt so as to have some recourse if the ordered product is not in working condition."
2,Not the quality I expected...,"I ordered season 1 and was stunned with great graphics and audio. Season 2, however, did not deliver. The audio seems to crackle like a cheap recording... I wish I hadn't bought it.."
3,the season 1 bootleg was superior,"I love digimon and I really don't care that this is a bootleg. I LOVE DIGIMON, that said I was very impressed by the season 1 boxset, but this one doesn't deliver in the audio department. It sounds like an old mono radio, it's really taking me out of the show. Alas, it is digimon, and I LOVE DIGIMON. Sorry, can't say that enough."
2,TOO PRICY!,This item was very over priced! I can't stress how much I love Digimon but the price for the season is too much!
1,This is a BOOTLEG,"Unfortunately, this (and other Digimon releases from Alliance Entertainment) is a bootleg. What you're buying here are DVDs burned by some guys that downloaded them off the Internet. The license to Digimon is currently owned by Disney...which is why it airs on ABC Family (owned by Disney) often. Disney does not license out their titles to be distributed on DVD by other companies.Save your money and do not buy this."
4,Playing Cards,"We loved the product, but we were overcharged for the postage.Elite Supreme Low Vision Playing Cards - Large Print"
2,Mediocre Fare (for Dischord),"Whoever told Alec MacKay he could pass as a vocalist? This has gotta be one of the most excruciating CDs to listen to in my collection. While being a big fan of a lot of the stuff Dischord Records has put out,Ignition epitomizes for me the downhill slump much of punk rock underwent in the mid to late 80's. The music lacks pace and punch, the lyrics are embarassingly preachy, and the whole affair has a dour air to it. Granted, there are a few songs on here - ""Anger Means"", their cover of the Vibrators' ""Keep it Clean"", and a coupla more -that even Alec's voice can't completely decimate, but it's not enough to recommend this to anyone other than diehard Dischord completists. Hard to believe bassist Chris Thomson went on from this (mostly) dismal affair to front such amazing bands as Circus Lupus, Las Mordidas, Monorchid and Skull Kontrol. Check out those bands!"
2,Okay at best,"The species covered in this book are, for the most part, covered well with decent images, but this book doesnt even really begin to cover enough species. It leaves out several common non-edible and edible species that regularly occur in the region with abundance. At most I'd say its a lack-luster book that is easily passed up and easily done without. It is true that with mushrooms its best to have several resources, but there are other books that cover the subject more broadly and efficiently."
2,i was insulted by this book,"while this book is a conveinient, easy to use, easy to carry field guide, the author seems to assume the reader is an idiot. it is almost as if he is purposefully withholding information. he reccomends the ""old man of the woods"", frankly a bad tasting mushroom, as an edible simply because it is easy to recognize. similarly he discourages eating/does not mention good edibles whenever he feels that the reader may be too stupid to avoid confusing them with other mushrooms. the book does not describe many species either. mushrooms of west virginia and the central appalachians is a much better regional guide, and mushrooms demystified is the best overall in my opinion."
5,Optimal emotional intelligence,I carry the 14 emotional mastery cards in my pocket book and use them when I feel off balance. Each card has a series of optimal thinking questions that help you understand a troubling emotion and resolve it. Highly recommended.
4,A good helicopter movie,"This is a great movie, especially if you are a sci-fi fan, and a helicopter fan. It has quite a bit of action, and high drama."
3,"Great movie back then, not so much today","I remember watching this movie a quarter of a century ago and marveled at how incredibly futuristic the Blue Thunder helicopter was, convinced it had to be the work of super talented special effects people. Some time later, I learned it was an actual US military helicopter that was used and that got me even more excited because I had thought it could do all the things depicted in the movie. I mean, silent mode and turbine boost? So realistically done too. Now, I just chuckle at how foolish I was having watched the movie again. Naturally, it wasn't quite as fun as when I watched it many years ago, still, it had some pretty nifty aerial combat sequences featuring some very low flying urban chase scenes and special effects that were way too good for its time. I would have given this movie 5 stars back then but only 3 today. Definitely worth watching if you like helicopters the slightest bit."
3,Was Hoping For More,"Overall, it was good to see the documentaries and how it was done (filming) back in the day but I was hoping for a more detailed view of how blue thunder was constructed and more footage of flight tests and so on. Maybe some interviews with the engineers and pilots would have helped it. It was also very annoying how the director makes the mistake of confusing the Gazelle helicopter with the inferior Aluoette. You would think the director of the best helicopter movie would know better."
2,Dated,"This movie was mildly entertaining. Very thin on a plot that is barely plausible. I watched it to see if it would get any better, it didn't. I watched the whole thing, so it wasn't a complete bomb, just very dated."
4,"Fun, but turn off your brain","This was one of the first VHS movies I bought. It's fun if you don't think and want to watch cool guys in cool machines trying to kill each other. The plot is thin, but the machines are cool, and for guys, sometimes cool machines are enough. I just happen to be one of those guys."
5,Still a good movie,"Still a great movie after all these years, and the commentary is priceless. Highly recommend."
4,Blue Thunder,"Great 80's movie full action, Roy Scheider was great as always, as was thw late Warren Oates. Picture and sound were top notch as well. Recommended."
4,Special Aircraft,"This helicopter is able to listen outsife a building, show a video of people. That is very special."
1,"lame action movie,but cool helicopter","at no time does this movie ever reach the point of being beliveable and even for an action movie at some point it has to do that! the helicopter is very cool,but do they really think that if it was going to be used to keep everyday people in line they would test it out in the open like this much less let a pilot that is known as aloose cannon be the one to test it?the other problem is that they go out of their way to keep the movie lite and then add a very sick murder in for spice i guess. skip it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great price for a good product ...,"My family doctor recommended Co-Q10 when I was diagnosed with a thyroid disorder, and suggested a rather high dosage (400-500mg/day). Co-Q10 seems to help counteract some of the more troublesome hypothyroid effects: joint pain, ""brain fog,"" etc. I'm always a bit skeptical of things like this, but it really does seem to help.I tried a number of different brands, trying to find the 200mg tablets or gels at the best price. I finally found these at Amazon, and I couldn't be happier. I'm now on a subscription, so I never worry about running out. The price is the best I've found for the 200mg dosage.They're not *too* big, either -- maybe 3/4"" long, 1/4"" in diameter. I've had some that were almost too big to swallow, but I don't have that problem with this brand. They're soft gels, too, so they go down a bit easier than hard tablets of the same size. I take mine at night, along with my other vitamins/etc."
2,No proof on it's use,"Spent big bucks buying all this stuff to make me feek great. All you really need is a daily vitamin, fish oil and EXCERCISE.Doctors said these will not hurt you, but you are wasting your bucks."
1,uninstall,well i have read all the reviews posted after i bought the game sadly. i can't even get mine to run properly on a new computer. since i doesn't even start up i guess i'll never tell ya'll that this game sucks
1,An utter waste of time and money,This game disgusts me to the point where I don't even want to write a review. Call it laziness but look at other negative reviews and my points would be about the same. This game is a complete waste of money and I'm seriously considering lobbying for a class-action lawsuit against the publishers
3,"Not as bad as you think, but could use work.","This game could be, by far, the best combat/strategy game in several years. Think Morrowind, with better graphics and class system.HOWEVER, I agree with those people that are ticked the game was released unfinished. It is an insult, and I will think long and hard before buying a game from this company or publisher again.Download the patch 1.3, and your game experience will improve dramatically. I am waiting hungrily for 1.4, but it keeps getting pushed back (another thing that tells me this game company is unreliable).Combat is rather repetitive, but fun. XP is very well thought-out. Class system is excellent. This game has a LOT going for it. Game map is HUGE (it took me 5-10 hours just to complete the first quest, getting into Fargrove)I don't agree with the 0-1 star reviews. I just wish they'd finished it before they released it. :P"
3,Wasnt a bad buy...,You know after reading all these reviews it would make anyone think twice on buying this game... Yes it has a few ifs and buts with it but for my bf he seems to enjoy it and hey for 9.99 at wal-mart it was not a bad deal... as for some of the people not being able to play it maybe they didnt have the 2.0 shadel support that this game requires. I am just saying that they have had time to work on this game and how will you ever know if you dont give it a try...
1,Thanks for saving me some money,"I just wanted to say that I nearly bought this game, but thanksto a lady I talked to at EB Games and the reviews by all you folks, I have saved my money. Many thanks for taking the time to submit a review...... Charlie Spivey Richmond VA."
1,to bad to describe,this one will go on the trash heap! to horrible to describe! come out with a second version quick. one with a map. this game is no fun at all.
4,Fun game but patience required.,"This game is a solid overall RPG but is a little buggy. I've seen some bad reviews but the game does not deserve some of the poor reviews it has received. The game is loads of fun with good character development and an interesting story line. The primary frustration comes because there are so many places where you have to accomplish certain tasks in order to proceed to a new area or new level in the game. In addition, the lack of a good map or journal in the game means you are lost a good portion of the time. The first person fighting is great and as you develop your character their are many ways to fight the numerous different types of enemies you encounter. If the developers had thrown in a few more interesting NPC's and had them explaining your path forward better, I would have given this game 5 stars. The only games that get that rating from me are Morrowind and Gothic 2. Still, this is an excellent game if you are patient as the story line develops."
3,Good game for the most part....,"This is a good game for the most part, however, it has quite a few bugs that can make gameplay frustrating at times! For the price it was well worth it in spite of few problems I've experienced. Very fast shipping from this seller!"
2,Horrible,This game was horrible. The game play and graphics are poor and buggy. Not worth the money!
1,D. W. Bradley should get himself sued for this marketing!,I think the guy who created this game should get sued for this marketing because many people have been saying it's a bad game with glitches and bugs man that is not good. I think Dungeon Lords should be taken off shelves and D. W. Bradley should get sued for this Marketing!
2,Buggy Release,"The game could have been great, but unfortunately, they seem to have released the Beta version. There is no automap, and you cannot customize your characters as advertised. In addition, there are a lot of game-stopping bugs that people have run into. There is one patch already and another that was supposed to be out this week, but has been delayed again. If they can fix the bugs with the second patch I might give this game a higher rating, but you should avoid buying it until at least the 1.2 patch is out. And if I were you, I would check the Dreamcatcher web site and their forums to see what the patch fixes before you buy it."
1,A Total Ripoff,"Released before finished and probably will never be finished.No Furniture in any towns (no NPC's either). No Caves to explore (as it says on the box). Half the features do NOT work, but if you like being a fighter it's kinda fun. More than half the spells are not working. Character custimization is not there even though the buttons are on the new player menu, but after many complaints, they fixed it. They removed the buttons. Enjoy mulitplayer with all the same characters?I reccomend you buy this game when it hits the DISCOUNT bins, and it will be there sooner than you think. Did I mention NO Ingame Music? Did I mention Boss's who say take all the goodies in my castle (but there's nothing in the castle)?Bottom line is the game had MUCH potential, but they went for the quick buck and are paying the price. Read the game Reviews before YOU WASTE YOUR 50.00.As one gamer put it, this game is missing so much it belongs on the back of a Milk Carton!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This game is absolutely horrible. No graphical character customization. No keys for turning, only strafing. Manual is extremely inadequate. Game play is awkward and clunky. Reminds me of old games for my Commodore 64 20 years ago. Designed and implemented about as well. Don't buy it, but if you must you can have mine!!! I'd rate it a 0 but the ratings only go as low as 1."
1,There is no God.,"This game blows. Seriously. I'd expound on it more, but I have to go hit my head with a hammer, which coincidently is a lot more fun than this game."
4,Original and funny,"Rea is not only a tremendous musician but shows he can act as well. If you appreciate British humor, this is a movie worth checking out."
2,Parting Shots,"I saw this on the day it was released in London and there were two people in the audience - me and someone else.The highlight of this film is a bitchy Diana Rigg who is incredibly supposed to be married to the main character played by Chris Rea - yeah right.I like the premise of the film too but I won't spoil it - and with such a great cast except for Chris Rea it should have been a blockbuster! But, it ain't!But look out for Joanna Lumley (The New Avengers and Absolutely Fabulous), Oliver Reed et al.I have the VHS but will buy the DVD too for my Diana Rigg collection."
1,Bad movie. Not funny at all.,There no funny scenes here. It's boring from the beginning till the end.It's a huge waste of money and time. I'm glad I rented it instead of buying.
4,No batteries required!,"I got this as a cheap alternative to a battried auto tuner. The notes are accurate and does the job. However, I noticed that blowing too hard (by not that much) will mess up the note. I recommend this for anyone that doesn't want to mess with a crummy 9-volt."
2,Stopped working after a short time,This worked fine for a short while and then the G3 section just won't work anymore. It doesn't make any sound at all. I'll have to buy another one but made by a different company.
2,Quick delivery,"Quick delivery but you get what you pay for.This was a cheap pitch pipe and the the tones are not accurate, should have spent a couple more dollars for a good one, but this does get the tuning close."
5,Great for the price,"Hello,I am so bad tuning my guitar that I can't even get the right octave right. So I use this and it works great. I am now taking online guitar lessons and they say to change your guitar strings after ten hours of use. Wow.Bill"
5,purchased for a friend.,great price and value. all musicians need a pitch pipe. I hope they use it. it was a good purchase.
5,A must-have for any true Deftones fan,"This single contains the album version of ""My Own Summer (Shove It)"" as well as 3 live tracks from a show. The live tracks all appear in their regular version on the first album, Adrenaline, and are ""Root"", ""Nosebleed"", and ""Lifter"". Anyone who has seen the Deftones live can truly appreciate this album. Another CD that fits this same mold is the other My Own Summer single, which contains 3 other live tracks. The unique style of the Deftones will draw in any listener, and this CD will definitely do the trick."
5,Left me wanting !!!,I love this. It left me wanting to know what would happen next. I so want to see more of this!
1,Disappointed,"This graphic might have been entertaining if I had not had to squint to read it. Resulting in a giant headache. Don't think I'll be reading any more,let alone paying for a headache."
4,My stress buster.,"This purchase was to remind me of the need for peace in my life and practicing a kindness to others that is forgotten in this chaotic world. I have it in my purse and read it whenever I have spare time waiting in line, or sitting in the park."
1,What's Happened to Intuit?,"I've been using versions of Quicken for well over a decade, but this version is so buggy that I removed it and replaced it with Quicken 2002. (I did update Quicken 2004 to the latest build, but it's still not ready for primetime.) The bugs were annoying but not catastrophic, like hidden accounts not staying hidden or windows not drawing properly. It froze at one point when I tried to access the help file, but I didn't lose any data. And my system is ordinarily very stable. But I'm not confident that my data would be safe. I've never returned software before, but I think I'm going to send this back to Intuit."
1,Year 2004,"Do not bother with Quicken 2004 Premier. Program will not open with operating system date set with a CY 2004 date. This problem started January 1st 2004. Intuit says they are ""aware of the problem"". Now, fifteen days into January 2004 no fix is available. I've used Quicken for over ten years.VERY DISAPPOINTED in support from Intuit.Send me an email (navyjim1@aol.com) if anyone has a fix."
1,Don't Even Think About Getting This Upgrade,I have loved Quicken until this upgrade. None of the version updates have corrected the bugs in this software. It runs poorly under Windows XP and even worse when I tried to use it on my laptop w/ME. Don't touch this one. I am very diappointed with Intuit at this point.
1,CAUTION!!! CAUTION!!!,"I've been a Quicken user since 1993 and have purchased and upgrade every year. This year I upgraded to 2004 in October and everything was fine until 1/1/2004, where the program fails to open my file and just hangs there not responding. But if I back date my computer to 12/31/2003 it opens just fine. I spent some time with the chat support and they told me that I will have to use Quicken's disaster recovery service, $200.00 and 10 days-yea right. It's too bad because since I upgraded I spent about 40 hours entering in Budget and Plan data which will now have to be reentered. My only hope is to use my backup and go to 2003 and take a good look at going to Money. Intuit really screwed this one up and their support has been even worse."
1,pay bill nightmares,"I've been using Quicken for over a decade and loved it all along the way. I'm a fully advanced user. I was very happy with 2000 but forced to upgrade to be able to continue on-line banking. I have had nothing but problems hooking up to the bank with my new 2004 (I've NEVER had one problem with this before in 5 years). I have used overseas Intuit techs for 3-4 hrs off and on (and they charge you!!!). Sometimes the bill-pay works, sometimes it doesn't. I know it's the new Quicken software as its never been an issue before. I am quiting Quicken. I've had it. There's something wrong with this program."
5,Excellent product.....,"The automatic download of your financial institution data to Quicken is a service provided by your bank, not Quicken. Don't blame Intuit if your bank/brokerage is not listed in the financial institution list.I'm a former MS Money user, so I coudln't give you a review on Quicken2004 from an ""upgrade"" standpoint. Only a fresh install standpoint. I switched to Quicken because 2 of the four financial institutions I use did not support MS Money. Only Quicken.Someone mentioned this program is a resource hog on their 1GHZ PentiumIII. This product runs perfectly fine on my 550Mhz P3 with 256MB of RAM.I have yet to experience any bugs or major inconveniences with this product after 3 months of use, and I couldn't be happier with it. I've owned a few versions of Quicken in the past and found them to be riddled with bugs and this version is definately different in my opinion. For the first time in my life, my finances are finally 100% in order."
1,Do not upgrade!,"I consider myself to be a Quicken ""power user"" and have been since 1991. Quicken Premier 2004 is awful. I just upgraded from 2002 Deluxe (skipped 2003). My PC has a Pentium 3, 1 gig speed, 256k memory. It's not enough to run this product. The program is such a memory hog that the PC locks up continually. I need to open the Task Manager, close everything that is running in the background, and can have no other apps open in order to work in Quicken. The changes to the interface in the securities accounts are drastic, unnecessary and not user friendly. Entering securities transactions is much more troublesome. You can't hide the Quicktabs bar anymore, thereby losing a lot of screen space. My custom toolbar is gone and you can no longer create custom icons for the toolbar. To recap, too much of a resource hog, no longer user friendly (and I am a CPA) and less available customization. This is an upgrade?"
1,Moo!,"I'm hoping to get a better response here than from Intuit's customer service. Could one of you people who simply love this product please tell me how you produce meaningful reports given:1. ""Exclude internal transfers"" includes internal accounts, anyway.2. Phantom amounts show up on reports. (Intuit has acknowledged this problem since April. It's now July...)Intuit made me upgrade in '99 because they forgot about Y2K. They made me upgrade again this year because they stopped online services for Quicken '99. Does anybody doubt that in a year or two, this product will no longer work? How else can they keep the cash cow alive?"
4,Better than I thought,"I was quite wary about Quicken 2004 when I read the reviews in regards to program stability and bugs. I had Quicken 2001 deluxe and just recently bought a Dell computer with Windows XP. I upgraded to Quicken 2004 Premier, I immediately checked for product updates, then imported my data and held my breath. Luckily my old quicken files imported without a hitch. So far no problems to report and it's been two months. No graphing issues or crashes. I like the interface it is much simpler especially for stock transactions. Now I do not do any real online banking or transactions other than stock quotes so I don't know how that is. I gave it fours stars instead of five for the marketing jazz that intermittently comes up. Overall I am satisfied with the product."
5,QUICKEN 2004 PREMIER,"I have used previous versions of Quicken (the latest 2000) and have always been very pleased. I was so pleased with version 2000 that I was reluctant to move to 2004 because I heard it could be cumbersome. Since I was notified by Intuit that they would no longer support version 2000, downloading quotes, etc. I felt that I needed to take the chance. I decided to go with Quicken Premier 2004 this time and am glad I did. Everything that I have wanted to do has been available and works very well."
2,Seems like it would do anything I need...?,"Quicken sure has a lot of options! Too bad I can't understand how to do ANY of it. Forget the tutorial, it was about as useful as instructions on a shampoo bottle. This is only user friendly to someone who has a degree in accounting. We are just starting out as far as our finances go, and there is little to no explaination for certain items a beginner wouldn't know (""Would you like to create an amortized loan?"" Sure! What the heck is it?).I don't know anything about MS Money, but I sure which I had checked it out before purchasing Quicken.Bottomline? If you are new to Quicken, don't expect to plug and play. I am purchasing several how-to books to figure out how this dang thing works. Figure the cost of extra help into the cost of purchasing a new edition. Too complicated, not user friendly."
2,Why can't I do simple things?!,"Terrible application and I wish I was still running 1999 Quicken. This program FORCES you to upload your data to quicken.com and I resent this. If you turn off the nearly hidden options so it does not send your financial data to quicken.com, then everytime you download stock quotes, it reports an error indicating you have not yet uploaded your data to quicken.com."
1,Bugs to the Point of Giving Up,I have been using Quicken for at least 10 years. I upgraded from 2002 to 2004 about two weeks ago. The program hits a bug about every other time I run the program. It shuts down and then I have to bring it up again. Note that I have fixed the Net Worth graphing problem described on the technical support site. I still get lots of bugs.Do not upgrade to this product at this time. Maybe in 3-6 months? I am not sure.I am going to try to get my money back and go back to 2002. I will need to retype two weeks worth of transactions and any other changes I have made! That is how frustrated I am.
4,Timeless,"I think the book birds von Daphne du Maurier is a good short novel. It's a little bit short, but that is not really bad. Because of the shortness, the book can't become boring.I like that the story is mysterious. The attack from the birds isinexplicable. It's not the usual behaviour of birds. But in spite of them, the story is believable, because the attack is possible. The birds are able to kill a woman or a man. If the animals were worms or something else, then story would be unbelievable and stupid.Another thing I like is the relation from the birds and the nature. The birds stand in this book for all nature disaster. It's just an other representation. I think it's a ingenious representaion.The book is timeless. Daphne du Maurier wrote this book brief after the second world war. It also have a relation to the war. And today the book get read again and again. In some years the book will probably be as popular as now."
1,This review is for the audio version.,"I absolutely love the story ""The Birds"" and was so excited when I found there was an audio CD version of it. Little did I know this version wasn't an unabridged reading--not even an abridged reading, it was rubbish that was painful to the ears.In this audio version there about 4 or 5 people, some male, some female, and after every sentence one of them read, overlapping the other. So it goes something like this:Guy: [The guy sat there looking at the birds]Now, as soon as he started saying ""birds"" a female would kick in with the next sentence.Female: [the birds were acting strange]then another guythen somebody elseTHE WHOLE WAY THROUGH!It was so bad, after listening to less than 2 minutes of it, I packed it up, and sent it back. Something that awful shouldn't be on the market. Especially when it's being done to such a fantastic story."
3,Not for chip seal roads,"First of all, these are comfortable when used. No complaints about that. I do have a problem with the rattling on anything but the smoothest roads, especially the chip seal roads that are so common on rural roads in my area. Like another reviewer said, it sounds like your bike is falling apart. When I'm cruising rural roads the last thing I need is bike noise. I solved the problem by using zip ties to tie the arm rests to the lower position. I'd rather do without the potential hand position on top of the bars than to hear that rattle. My next set will not have the arm rests that flip up. When they're down and being used, I like them a lot."
3,Interesting,It was a good movie and had my attention but it was a little slow moving. Good acting in this movie.
1,Keep far away from this one,"The sound quality on this DVD is simply atrocious. Having bought a number of excellent opera and classical DVDs in the past from this label, Arthaus Musik (including Marriage of Figaro and Mahler's 5th Symphony), I thought this would be another DVD produced in high-quality sound. I could not have been more wrong. The audio track is patchy and muffled throughout, and it even skips in a couple of key spots. It is incredibly aggravating to listen to if you like to listen to the music closely.This performance from the early 1990s is actually quite good -- James Conlon conducts with verve, Carol Vaness (here in her prime) sings Donna Elvira brilliantly, and Thomas Allen is still a commanding Don Giovanni (though he looks and sounds noticeably older here than he did in the La Scala performance conducted by Riccardo Muti, also available on DVD). Unfortunately, the truly horrible sound destroys any enjoyment one might derive from this performance. Buyer beware."
4,A big opera,See my title good video good audio (pcm is better) good actors This opera can't lack in a collection's opera amateur
4,NOT A BAD ALBUM,"The Peacocks are back with another high powered cd. Not as good as ""in without knocking"" but still good."
3,Entertaining but Poor research???,"I'd feel a lot more secure on the information in this entertaining read if the author or editor had known that the husband of Kitty Carlsle Hart was director-playwright Moss Hart, not a composer and that the last name of composer Richard Rodgers was not Rogers."
3,Not so fabulous and not on the ball,"This was an OK read but if promised more than it delivered. It was more of a truncated Truman biography with an extended piece on the party rather than the press-your-nose-up-to-the-glass-and-peek-through-the-gossamer-curtains-to-a-land-of-wonder fable that I, at least, was expecting. Oh well, perhaps the inablility to capture the magic of Mr. Capote's Black and White Ball on paper is what keeps its legendary status intact."
4,An entertaining social history,"An enjoyable insight into the world of New York socialites and an unusual character who rose from small town anonymity to become a key power-broker in that world. The book also traces the personal traits which lead to his downfall. There is a great mix of colorful imagery of the lavish lifestyles and ultimate party, along with interesting social commentary. Truman's eccentricities are revealed in a way which doesn't allow him to become a caricature. A fun weekend read."
5,A great read!,"This was a fabulous time in history, especially in New York. Party of the Century captures every detail, not only of Truman Capote's party, but all the events that surrounded it, and that lead up to it. Deborah Davis writing style is wonderful, and pulls you right into the story. I plan on reading it again!!"
2,Not worth the money!,"This is much too expensive for just one roll. The chocolate is mediocre, the cost is prohibitive, and the packaging doesn't protect it from breakage."
4,Great set of songs,"Just more music to add to my classic rock playlist. I could do without the long movie sound clips though, some of them are pretty lengthy, but its not a huge deal, I just removed those items from my playlist when I play the disc. Sound quality is fantastic. And of course the most important part, DRM free! :)"
1,What A Ripoff!,"You can only buy a select too few in MP3 that the CD has on it anyway, they shouldn't sell any of it for that sort corporate obstinacy!"
4,Yes.,"Tarantino's abnormal musical tastes any choice of deciding all of the songs that go into his movies contributed to the overall great quality of this CD. If you've seen the movie, and liked it, you should buy the CD."
4,Ulmaaaahhh!,"What can I say? The cool music is mixed in with bits of dialogue from the film. People walk into my office thinking I am a square, and then they hear...""And I will strike thee down with Furiuos Anger...Bang Bang Bang!"". Oh well. I had to have the music just so it would not play again and again in my head. I bought this on suggestion from the website when I went to buy Kill Bill. I am glad I did. It makes a great set, and it has different music I would not normally buy. I like to play it in the car so it feels like I am in the movie. The box was new(?), and the CD plays without flaws."
4,Cool as the movie,"I know some people didn't like the dialogue before some of the songs, but that gave it the coolness of the movie. The sweet dialogue and the awesome music. The whole soundtrack just grooves along, there's only one song that is really annoying and sticks out, the red dress song or whatever it's called. Very good and this is one of those CD's you always carry with you, because you never know when there might be a party going on. YEAH!"
3,damage jewel cd case,I guess one gets what they pay for. ok I paid a penney for the sound track of pulp fiction. Nothing was mentioned on the web site about a damage jewel case. that to me is misleading..other wise the music is great...the cd case was smashed and the hinges broken on the case...thanks Ron B
2,Link Wray,"Due to the fact of Link Wray not included in the soundtrack, I must give 2 stars. Three of Link Wray's songs are played in the movie. Surely the song ""Rumble"" must have, at least, been considered to be included!Josh"
4,16 definitions of cool,"It makes sense that when Tarantino was in the grips of his creative writing peak, this unusually attuned song selector would be at his best as well. Stringing together this unusual mix mainly contrasting R&B with Surf but certainly throwing in other classic genre nods as well, Pulp Fiction's distinct sequencing still stands out as one of the hippest soundtracks to emerge."
2,U gat what u pay for,"The sizing is WAY OFF! I am size 9 & I ordered the appropriate size for me. IT WAS WAY TOO SMALL! If you are a small size, do your self a favor & buy a MUCH BIGGER SIZE!!!"
3,Sizing is off,"I gotta say that it is a really cute piece, buy I'm a size 5 and it was just way too big. It was closer to a medium than a small."
3,3 and 1/2 Stars,"Both of the stories in this book are a departure from Heinlein's usual work, and neither are entirely successful. Heinlein was never one for truly ""hard"" science fiction, but the two stories here are distinctly fantasy. The first, Waldo, is the better and far more imaginative of the two. The plot and premise is highly original, and the character of Waldo is an interesting one. However, this is one of Heinlein's earliest stories and the writing style present in it pales in comparison to later efforts, and may be disappointing to those who have read a significant portion of his later work. The same goes also for Magic Inc., although here the premise is less interesting. Not a bad book by any means, but Heinlein has better. Only hard-core fans need apply here, for the newcomer to RAH he has much better to offer."
3,"Unless you are Heinlein-obsessive, you can skip these two stories","These two early Heinlein tales have been sold as a package almost forever. And while they're not really awful, they are showing their age badly. There's nothing quite as tedious as lengthy descriptions of ""future"" technologies that never materialized! If you are a Heinlein completist, and feel you must read everything the man ever wrote, then go for it. Otherwise, you can easily skip this dated duo of stories and not worry that you've missed much."
3,two relatively weak short science fiction novels..,"'Waldo' and 'Magic, Inc' are two fairly forgettable stories. 'Waldo' is the more interesting of the two. Difficult to explain, but the story concerns a petulant young genius who is self-exiled in space. He returns to Earth when his services are needed, feeding his already sizable ego. But then he discovers something about himself in the process. 'Magic, Inc' is a rather haphazard story about a world where magical services are part of every day business life. Although whimsical in the beginning, the story turns dull when it gets all political ... yuck!Bottom line: although not terrible, these stories are certainly not worth seeking out ... even by Heinlein fans. Not recommended."
5,Heinlein lays the Foundations,"Meet the man, the myth, the legend behind science fiction's ubiquitous ""waldoes"", then wade in to an intricate spiritual and legal battle against a magical monopoly."
4,It is all about the Void on this one!,"Void is a highly underrated hardcore band. Probably the first punk band to really expirement around with guitar feedback. They also played a real chaotic style with wrenching vocals that made them stand out on their own in the early DC hardcore scene. on some songs they sound shriller and thrashier, and I think that can be attributed to the fact they were drunker on one of the recording sessions (they were infamous for the drunken mayhem of their shows, I guess that is another thing that made them unique in a scene where being sXe was the norm.) Just some good solid and unique hardcore coming from the Void on this cd...As for the Faith, they are OKAY... The first stuff on the album is from their side of a split they did with the Void. Their stuff just seems like a boringer version of Minor Threat... that is why I give this album 4 stars because of how dull Faith's stuff is..."
1,"bought for class, couldnt read it","This book not only put me to sleep within 10 seconds of opening it, but it also ruins america. somehow."
4,Kept me on the edge of my seat.,"But I still wonder, why does Chirstopher Lambert pick the movies he does? He can be a great blockbuster star. Resurrection wasn't that bad, but the quick paced, rushing camera shots wasn't very appealing. Other than that, great story, action, and actor ^_^"
2,Plays best as a parody,"I saw this in the late 90s when it first his cable in America. I used to be a dedicated supporter of Russell Mulcahy due to his excellent work in Highlander (I was able to pretend the sequels didn't exist). I understood that he was something of a hack, aping the Scott brothers' best work. As I get older, it bugs me more because I notice upon rewatching Mulcahy films that it takes more than smoke to bring life to the Scotts' images. RESURECTION sees Mulcahy move his aping to then fresh talent, David Fincher. RESURRECTION isn't meant to be a really good film. Meant to be entertaining and to be as close to a remake of SEVEN as legally possible. Watching the film now, it seems very possible that Mulcahy meant to make fun of SEVEN by employing an overwrought approach to the Fincher style and amping the intensity of the acting to 11. Or 12 or 24."
3,"Good story, Bad acting","This movie has a very good story. It is really frightening and suspenseful. However, the acting leaves much to be desired. I don't like to say anything negative about Christopher Lambert because I do like him a lot. I think that he did a good job in HIGHLANDER, THE ROAD KILLERS, and THE HUNTED. I also think that he was very good in HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME. But he was not good at all in this movie. He's not alone, though. The performances of the other actors aren't exactly memorable either. Other than the acting, the movie is really good. However, it is very gruesome so if you're the squeamish type it'd be best to avoid this movie."
4,Gruesome and entertaining,"This film is truely gruesome and graphic. It's everything you'd want in a serial killer movie and more. The acting isn't very good but the visual effects make up for it and the ending is satisfying. If you don't want to see blood & guts with nuts, don't watch this film. But if you do, this one's for you!"
2,should be classified as a horror movie,It is so moronic as a police drama/mystery that it has to be considered a horror movie.
1,Abomination for sale,"This movie is for morbidity lovers. I have trouble understanding how someone can make a movie like that. If you are insane and have a twisted mind, this movie is for you (as long as you are kept in a straight jacket). This movie is not even worth any rating; anything as low as you can imagine will still be higher than this film is worth. Definitely a movie to stay away from at any cost."
1,"Buggy software; disappointing customer ""service""","The software is buggy and the publisher won't help debug it. While importing data from an earlier version of Quicken, this package selectively omits transactions. The customer-support system was utterly useless this afternoon. Ninety minutes into a frustrating web-based ""support chat,"" the man said he wasn't trained to help me with the problem. I asked for another person to ""chat"" with, who suggested I manually enter the missing transactions. When I pointed out that I had 13 years worth of data in 21 accounts amounting to 20,000 transactions, they suggested I pay them $130 to convert the data for me. Pshaw. I wouldn't trust this software with my finances, nor would I trust this company."
1,Stick with your old version of Quicken!,"Do yourself a favor and skip Quicken 2004, or switch to MS Money if you have to upgrade. I'm running Jaguar on a G4 and had been using Quicken 98 in Classic mode with no problems, same as I had done in OS 9. I figured the 2004 version had to be even better, plus it seemed to be a no-brainer to run in native OS X mode. Wrong. 2004 crashes constantly, especially when reconciling. It doesn't *seem* to have corrupted my data yet (that I can see, at least) but the crashing alone is totally unacceptable--especially for a personal finance package that's tracking your money. I used to love Quicken but I'm soured on it forever now. I'm really thinking of getting a PC or running Virtual PC 6 so I can start using Money."
1,Disillusioned with Mac Quicken,"Like the other highly negative reviews, I too have used Quicken faithfully recording every transaction. I finally abandoned Quicken 2004, throwing it away from my new iBook, G4. I returned to the use of Quicken 2000.I missed the Billminder. Why, for gosh sakes, have a money program if you don't get reminded to pay your bills. Q 2004 doesn't do this any more. Try to do a loan calculation estimate? you won't get a complete window, so the *payment* you wanted to calculate doesn't show.Etc!!! Just an inferior product. Do not buy it! Save your Quicken 2000 for Mac. Intuit doesn't support your old versions (thank you very much!).but at least the features that are there, work. Good luck!"
1,Buggy and cumbersome - Need an alternative,"after days of trying to get this software to work as expected, i'm ready to return it. i even bought a book to see if i was doing something wrong. the book is written for the Windows version and apparently is completely different. downloading data from Bank of America is very buggy. (not the fault of BofA, the data is clean, Quicken mixes up the records, wrong dates, changes amounts and titles, assigns strange categories, etc.) their support was completely unresponsive. their help files didnt address the issues. if this is your first time using financial software, there is no good way to get old information in. wish MS Money was available for Mac. really wish Apple would write an alternative. feel trapped with Quicken because there is no real competition."
1,HORRIBLE. Save your money.,"It doesn't work. Read the other reviews and save your money - you'll save more by NOT buying Quicken 2004 for Mac than you ever would trying to use it. Just bought it, and after 3 months of thinking ""i must be daft,"" realized that I'm not and it's actually the software. Too bad Intuit has the monopoly on it all... waiting for a much better alternative. In the meantime, back to my ledger and calculator...."
2,"Ok, but don't expect the Windows version","I just got a Powerbook and had to switch from PC. I assumed everything would be the same with Quicken, but only read all the reviews on Amazon after I ordered the product. I got very worried and I almost didn't open the box. I'm happy to say that the product loaded up fine. Converting from Windows was another matter. You've got to get rid of a lot of definitions and account info. Even then, the program failed to carry over all the info and I had to spend hours trying to find out what was missing. I finally gave up and did a reconciling adjustment. Since then, everything has worked well, but the interface is pretty bad compared to Windows. But, what are the alternatives?"
1,It doesn't even clear a transactions anymore,"I'm an old Quicken user. I like to use the check mark to clear a transaction in the register; but it no longer does this. It thinks it can do it, but it can't. I researched and saw this was a common problem that Intuit claims it's working on. I'm not willing to wait so I returned it."
3,"Wish Bill G made ""Money"" for Mac","Having used Quicken for over 10 years - - '90 - '02, and '03-'04 - - I switched to MS Money in 2003 when I was still using PCs. I recently switched to a Powermac G-4, and am glad I did, but the one thing I miss the most in the PC world is MS Money: it is just a better, more intuitive product. Unfortunately, Quicken is the only game in town for Mac users. It's okay, but Money is better."
1,These reviews can't be all wrong!!,"I'm a little leary of the ""positive"" reviews indicating that user's should 'fix the glitches in their OS""!Frankly, i won't buy any version 2003 or newer until i see better reviews!Currently, I run quicken 2000 OS9 on my OSX ibook... if you can find it, buy that instead!"
3,"Quicken 2004 for Mac - not great, but not bad either.","I upgraded from Quicken 2003 to 2004...There are some nice additions that bolster this version. However, if you are using 2002 or 2003 there is nothing stunning with 2004 that you absolutely have to have.Kudos to Intuit for supporting the Mac platform with Quicken - it is much appreciated that they are thinking about the Mac community.That said though, I wish Quicken for Mac was as intuitive and slick as Quicken for Windows. It just seems to me that the PC version is more full featured and easier to use."
1,Do not purchase if using Mac OS X 10.3,"Although it looks nice, it still doesn't have the same features as the windows version. A common problem for those of us with Panther, is that Quicken keeps unexpectly quitting when you try launching it. The only solution is to reinstall the software package. There's nothing on Quicken's web site about this, although its quite a well known problem reported on quite a few web sites. I've been very disappointed with Quicken because of this, and pray for a competitor."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"I switched from Windows to Mac about six months ago. I LOVE my Mac, but I absolutely HATE Quicken 2004 for Mac. It's full of strange bugs, lacks many of the features of its Windows counterpart, and, worst of all, Intuit customer support is completely clueless about how to help me with any of this when I call them. The online Help feature is worthless, too. It tells you to do things you either can't do, or that don't work. It's awful. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy."
1,Don't Even Think About It,"A total waste of money and time - not to mention space on my Mac. I can write, in longhand, my records and use my Mac calculator for computations in the time it takes just to find the page I need in Quicken. Shame on Intuit! Bah, humbug...."
5,Excellent DVD Player.,"Excellent player, the picture quality is stunning, light and thin, 3 hour battery, awesome sound (for such a small player), deserved five stars! I had it for a month, works great, no problem at all. I bought Mintek DVD 8"" portable player first, the price was much better, but the quality of the picture is too low. The worst part - Mintek does not format the movies properly, if you watch wide format you get two black bars on the top and bottom, if you watch TV format - you get bars on both sides. So you loose big chunk of the screen. I took it back and bought Audiovox. With Aidiovox, the picture fills the screen with no distortion, excellent quality player!"
1,Not what I expected.,I only baught this CD for one song on it (because it was hard to find anywhere else). But the song on the CD was different than the one I wanted. It was really bad remix of it.
3,Disapointing,"This book read like a report of activities, only less interesting. Great deamatic scenes were covered without any special attention : And then this happened, and then this happened, the end.Great fantasy plot, could've been treated better. If the whole series were as strictly spare and dry as this it would be ok, but the first books were different. Consistancy doth a great read make, and this book was inconsistant with the rest of the series.If it were a concious choice on the author's part to write a book in this style that's one thing, but the way the writing changed partway into the series it looked like she just got tired of it all and ground her outline out onto the paper. Like she just wanted to get it over with, was bored with the whole thing .And it had so much promise...."
3,Downhill,As an end to a series one senses that somewhere mid way through the book the author decided she had enough already and stopped. Things to get us to the conclusion were rushed and glossed over where we did not have that earlier on.Disappointing
1,Very poorly written,"I am very disappointent. It is outright boring stuff. Heroes are just sketches, names with not a bit of real life or emotions behind them. Incomprehensive sorsery, stupid empire, stupid plot, stupid dialogs, I got bored out of my mind at the first half of the first bool already. Just had to read it through before donating to the local library. These books are a good example how not to write fantasy.Try Robin Hobb or Guy Kay for a taste of first class writing"
1,Unsound advice,"Look at the track record, find out how many thousands of dollars have been spent by ex-pats of this mans various bankrupt churches he has left from coast to coast in the United States. His own children have abandoned him. His church is no longer, his ""ministry"" goes against his own prophetic garbly-gook and if you drank the original Kool-Aide he dished out you can see by his own words why he should not be followed or read. I used to edit all the inappropriate, sexual, content from his sermons for public consumption, he is a pig."
1,Beware of Product Claims,"As per the previous comment, the unit DOES NOT provide track information on the Sony head unit. I purchased it because the marketing material said it would show ID3 tags on units that had this. Well my Sony unit has this feature and it did not show anything but erroneous track information. Dension support admitted this is the case. I also could not get the head unit to advance, start and stop the iPod - which may be a fault in my particular unit. So if you are looking to use your Sony head unit rather than the iPod for navigating tracks, you will have to look elsewhere. Not much value for money in my opinion and I am returning mine too."
3,"Versatile, reasonably priced guinea pig toy, but...","This has been a popular toy with our guinea pigs over the years, but I did want to mention that, as with any wood toy or hidey, it's important to watch out for signs of excessive soiling or chew damage. Because products like this come in regular contact with wet bedding, etc., they are breeding grounds for bacteria and mold. Wood splinters can also cause mouth injury or become a choking hazard.Speaking of wood...I recently followed up with SuperPet after another reviewer asserted that the FiddleSticks toy is made from oak. SuperPet responded that the wood used for this item is heat-treated *pine.* Not sure where that customer got his/her information.Overall, a decent toy that should be removed/replaced once it has become soiled or damaged. I'd give it a 5-star rating if the materials and labor were Certified-USA (it's made in China, like most pet toys these days)."
2,"Too small for guinea pigs, but getting nibbled on",This hideout is far too small for my guinea pigs. I'm guessing the animal in the photo is a hamster! They are nibbling on it a little bit but otherwise it takes up space in the cage and they never go under it.
3,Cute but Small,Cute and good for chewing but i am disappointed that my guinea pig can't fit underneath it. It is too small despite being advertised for guinea pigs.
3,Too small,"Good little house. The colors look good in the cage. My guinea pigs like to go underneath it but they only fit if I prop it up against the cage. If it's flat on the ground, the piggies don't fit."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"Oh MY GOD did this movie stink! It wasn't even kind of funny. It's basically a dozen or so so-called ""clips"" of tv shows that are (supposed to be) just like extreme examples of the reality crud that is on today. Trust me on this one, do NOT watch this! I didn't even watch the whole thing, and of the half of the clips that I did watch, I only watched a portion of them. It was THAT horrible. I'm glad I have a movie pass from blockbuster so I didn't have to shell out $4 to rent this one, because I would have been mad as hell if I did. Absolutely garbage! Total junk. This should be -10 stars at the most! But unfortunately, amazon's lowest rating is 1 star. AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
3,NOT FOR THE EASILY OFFENDED,"This movie reminded me of the type of humor we saw in the old Groove Tube movie. There is something to offend everyone in this film. I thought the Amazing Racist was offensive and stupid. Perhaps I am just getting a little too PC in my old age. The guys who thought they were making out, but were really with a hooker was out of Cable Guy. I didn't care for Dying Dave, the last days of a guy who knows he is dying. The old folks home stuff was simply gross and lacked any real humor. In fact, had it not been for the casting couch episode (watched twice) I would have only rated this movie two stars. Mostly juvenile humor. But hey, this is National Lampoon and what have they done intelligent lately?"
2,"Eeeehhhhhhh...............you get what you pay for, if it's a dollar.","Well, I got what I paid for, and that was a few bucks. It was kind of like a lame mix between 'kids in the hall', one of those 'world's funniest commercials' shows from the 90's, and a Mad Magazine-turned-Movie. It's one of those movies you'll watch once then tuck away in a far corner of your video library, next to the VHS copies of 'Jackass' and 'I Spit on your Grave'."
4,National Lampoon's Lost Reality 1 & 2,So many good pranks and ideas. It's obvious that a bunch of it is staged. They hired porn stars and stand up comics to do some of the stuff. But I must say the best parts are The Amazin' Racist.
4,They're back,"This CD starts out a little strange - it is not their normal style, however after listening to it a few times I realized that the mix of rock, ballad and pop blended well into a tight album. The high points - the man who sold the world, being boiled and dancing barefoot - showed that they are still able to churn out good songs...."
5,ANOTHER KID FAVORITE,"I am much like another reviewer here (Nelson). I do not really care all that much for the froggy books myself, this one included. BUT...the kids all love them! I have yet to find one young child that did not what this and the other Froggy Book read to them over and over and over again. This, as the other reviewer pointed out, is what counts. I must say though that I found this particular book rather good in helping children understand the process of going to the doctor. Most of them do fear it, just like Froggy, and this work points out the fact that most of these fears are rather unnecessary. I like that. Recommend this one."
5,ROUTE 66:EZ GUIDE FOR TRAVELERS,"My wife and I bought the book in in early October of this year. We then took the old route from Brookfield Illinois to the Texas/New Mexico border and just came back home. The book was right on target. In fact, we would have been lost with all the twists and turns around the major cities,i.e., St. Louis, Oklalhoma City, etc. A must have book if you want to see 95% of the still existing route along the backcountry."
5,EZ Route 66,Route 66 guide was easy to follow and easy to read. This is very important when trying to drive and get instructions from a passenger. I will be traveling Route 66 this summer and I will be using this guide as my sourse.
5,U. S. Travelers,FINALLY! A Route 66 guide that is easy to follow going both directions. We used it on our latest trip and it was a breeze. Congratulations to the author.
5,Top Route 66 Road Guide,"This is the guide we have been waiting for. It's easy to use. It gives us information about landmarks and it has fun games for kids. Of all the maps and guides for this road, it's the best!"
4,faithful road friend,"helpful old school travel guide. faithful road mate even if not mostly not up to date anymore!, love the sketches inside. don t buy it for the good food tips but more has an historical and travel guide."
5,EX 66 guide,Excellent review of Route 66. It is great for advance planning and can also be used while on the road.
3,Route 66: EX66 Guide for Travelers,"I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting something I could use as a map as well as a travel guide. It would have been better if the ""map drawings"" were computer designed and easier to read. I'm sure we'll make good use of it, but I still need to find a Route 66 map. I do like the spiral binding which makes it easier to handle, but probably wouldn't recommend...sorry."
1,fluff,"I was very disappointed with this book. I purchased this because my husband and I were driving from SF to Chicago and taking the old route 66. This book really did not have a lot of useful information...just weird random tidbits that weren't even interesting. The maps were confusing and drawn in a way that was cartoonish and distracting. I guess when it comes to travel guides, I prefer informative to a weak attempt at entertaining. You can find and download better information online just doing google searches."
5,The best guide for Route 66,Just recently drove Route 66 from Oklahoma to Arizona/California border and used this book exclusively. Maps are easy to read and understand and the directions given are outstanding. Looking forward to using it again in the near future. Highly recommend this guide if you plan to travel any part of Route 66!
2,not what I expected,"I am dissapointed in this book. Although many guns are listed many common ones are not. I wanted this book to use as a price reference when buying used guns. However, as I said many of the modern guns I was looking for are not listed. Many obscure guns are listed but that is not what I wanted. This is a good book to thumb through on a rainy day but not a comprehensive value guide."
5,For the library of a reasonable gun owner.,My husband enjoys this as a reference. Good and accurate information. Perfect for evaluating his estate and the value of his collection.
5,Wow!,That's all I can say about this release---WOW! This is phenomenal. I'm not even going to go in to a track by track analysis here. This is absolutely the best jazz CD I own---and I own a lot of them.Money well spent. I guarantee you---you will not be disappointed!
1,Charlie Watts,The skill and natural abities of all the group shine through the entire CD. It is a joy to listen to and my admiration for Charlie Watts grows even further. He makes his music look so easy and all other drummers sound like amateurs.
3,Cheesy Fun,"This movie was made around 1955 so the above ""1941"" listed year is 14 years too early. I haven't seen this DVD version but I have seen the film. Swamp Woman was not intended to be taken seriously! It is a mans' fantasy film about beautiful women convicts holding a handsome guy and his girl-friend hostage in the swamp! heee! A sort of guilty pleasure. My enjoyment of this film is watching Beverly Garland, who is always wonderful to look at!"
1,I have small ankles!!!,this item doesn't come close to fitting my ankles...if you have small ankles DO NOT ORDER....they would fit around my waist..well almost :-) other than that they're great..
3,"Good Old School Punk (Oh, and they're girls)","Closer in sound to the 1977 Avengers and early Sonic Youth than contemporaries like Veruca Salt and Elastica, however accessible to fans of both the former and the later. If you like Siouxsie & the Banshees early work and Peel Sessions you might be able to get into this, but if you are more partial to later Siouxsie recordings, then this is probably too raw for you. Best tracks include: Night X 9, the title track and Semi-Blue Tile."
5,Very Funny Stories,"The CD arrived much earlier than expected which was a bonus. The stories are still as funny as ever even after years of listening to them.Justin Wilson seems to get lost a few times, but does a good job of covering it up with his Cajun accent and delivery."
1,Was not Good Quality,The sound was not clear or good. Sounded like an amature did this. Gave it for a gift wish I had known the quality would have sent it back.
1,A Stinker,A stinkingly bad 'comedy' with some really annoying and unsympathetic characters and some really annoying incidental music.At least we do get a 1 sec view of Sharon Stone naked; although the IMDB guys seem to thinks it's a body double.
1,YAWN!,"There was absolutely no humor in this movie. It was supposed to be a comedy, right? It was BORING!"
1,Simply Awful,"This was not the worst movie of all time, but it was bad enough. It is the sort of movie that makes you want to invent a time machine, just so you can travel back in time to somehow prevent the movie from being made."
4,review of the muse,"The Muse is a good movie and more comic than any other aspect of it. The inspiration parts of it really don't work, but it's fun to watch."
1,Art Truly Imitates Life,"A shining example of how a movie trailer is better than the actual film itself. It's the story of a washed-up film writer on the brink of being edged out of the industry unless he can manage one decent story/script. Albert Brooks MUST have a LOT of friends in the business. I can think of no other explanation for HOW this film got made in the first place. In the best interest of your sanity, avoid spending money on this one. Wait until it shows up on Fox or something."
2,"if Albert Brooks is funny, this must be his worst","This is the only Albert Brooks film I've seen, and it's unfair to judge a writer, director, or actor (all three, in this case) on the basis of a single film. That said, I found it extremely difficult to believe that any of this man's films could be funny or enjoyable. The film is unsubtle, badly paced, and silly. The dialogue always falls short of real comic inspiration. Nothing terrible - just consistent mediocrity. Judging from ""The Muse,"" Albert Brooks's movies seems to be dull versions of Woody Allen's. This is beginner's-level comedy and not worth anyone's time or money. (A cameo by Steven Wright does provide some comic relief.)NOTE: After seeing Brooks's hilarious performance and improv outtakes on the new ""Simpsons"" first-season DVD collection, I have revised my opinion. Clearly he is very funny. But if he is able to make good movies, ""The Muse"" is not good evidence."
4,A-Musing!,"Love the way Brooks demonstrates the relative irrelevance of Hollywood scriptwriters. Though it's hard to well and truly sympathize with a character of such financial means and the film does craftily illustrate the vanity and blind willingness to go along with anything that will help them maintain their life of luxury - the Brooks character making it plain that he wants to write big blockbusters in favor of indie films - in order of course, to live the high life. A major plus, though, is that Brooks is free of a persistent and annoying, donkey laugh typified by a certain ubiquitous businessperson."
5,Realistic and best Ambler,"As one with guerrilla warfare experience,this story rings a bell. The descriptions of professionals and others in the disintegrating Greek Communist Vafiades-led ELAS Guerrillas of the late 1940s is striking. The plot twists are excellent, a are the brilliant thumbnail descrriptions of chaaracters, an Ambler forte. As a longtime Ambler devote, I feel this is his best mystery novel. Ringokid6"
3,A boring Ambler--Mais non!,"I had high hopes for this title that I somehow overlooked all these years. But alas, it was a tedious read. All about an inheritance that went back many generations and a dull lawyer plodding through the details of locating an heir. Ambler must have phoned it in on a busy day. (So why 3 stars? Even a dull Ambler is better than most stuff out there today.)"
3,"WORTH IT JUST FOR ""YOU SHINE ON ME""","I JUST BOUGHT THE CD , AND I ESPECIALLY WANTED IT FOR THE SONG BY LOLA..NO STRINGS. BUT THE SONG FOLLOWING IT IS MY FAVORITE SO FAR...YOU SHINE ON ME BY LUZ DIVINA.GREAT SONG.WORTH THE PURCHASE ..LOTS OF OTHER GOOD TRACKS."
1,not worth the plastic it was printed on,"Just as previous reviewers here have stated, this is utter mainstream garbage. No respectable, actually, make that no club that wants to attract a crowd would ever play any of this outdated bs that has been mixed and remixed years and years ago.You would think that someone like vic latino (although i frequent almost every major nyc club and have never hear his name uttered), along with his KTU cronies would have the ties in the club culture to be able to stick together a reasonable club banger, but this is complete mainsteam misrepresentation that is mean to appeal not to actual clubbers but to 40 year old women driving in their cars on the way to soccer practice. If youre into club music do yourself and favor and dont waste your money."
1,"IF you really love club music , do not purchase","For starters, I am a huge night life fan, and have been for sometime now. And I agree with Konrad with th emainstream aspect. I still do not get how you can have all of this ""party music"" and expect to really get into it. The real club music gets in your bones, and fill you up with so much energy you can explode. That is NYC night life and NYC club life. This Vic Latino is no real DJ, and has no clue what real club music is. He does his appearances and is a hit with all the sweet 16's, and bar/ batmizvahs, but come on people. DOn't fall for this outdated,overated, non DJing, laughable silly KTU garbage ANd that goes for MIke Rizzo's album as well. THe CD should have a label sayinG ""WARNING: THESE ARE NOT REAL NYC CLUB TRACKS OR DJS. SO STAY AWAY FROM LAMENESS AND 80 MINUTES OF BORING CRAP"" ANd Sylver's ""all this tie used to be good ladies and gentlemen, like 4 yeards ago. again this station ruins club music and Latino is a joke."
5,Moving emotional experience watching this video,"Amazingly good video of the March. I wanted to go but didn't, but watching this video was like going. Courtney Love was especially moving, talking about how her husband had a drug dealer friend buy him a gun one day, then killed himself the next.I've shown the video to several friends who were also moved."
1,"Master Deceiver, not Marriage Helper","BUYER BEWARE! This CD will only confuse you about genuine biblical principles. Dr. Drummond and any ministry he may be associated with is on a mission to deceive, bamboozle, and manipulate to separate from your hard earned dollars in order to support his ""great call"", which by the way is his 3rd or 4th to date. Do not buy, do not support, and do not attend. You may easily be sucked in to the charismatic egomaniac's ways of deceiving you into believing his point of view of what God has for you. Stay away!!

1,Don't be the Best Thing that Ever Happened to FAD's Bank Account!,"This guy has left a trail of broken families & broken bank accounts over the last 40 years and now has his sites set on South Florida. Don't take my word for it, just look at all of the wonderful things people have written about him over the years. The picture of a good neighbor, he sets up a church, milks it for all he can, then steals of to the next town leaving a vapor trail of fractured families and MILLIONS of dollars in unpaid bills.Go to a good church. Get Godly advise, but PLEASE, for your own sake dont take it from this man.If you're into keeping rude, pompus windbags driving expensive cars and cruising the French Riviera, this disk is for YOU!"
1,no happiness in marriage,"If happiness in marriage is what you are after, then stay far away from this man and his message. He is a predator that attempts to hide using the guise of religion. He is a known cult leader.I was a member of his ""church"" for many years and witnessed very few marriages worth envying there. Find many more testimonies."
4,My 11 year old daughter is enjoying this,"My daughter uses the Apple program at school and wanted a music creation program to use at home on her notebook. We looked at reviews together and chose this software. When it arrived, my wife almost returned it because the package says it is for kids 6 to 9 years old. However, based on these reviews, I advised we keep it. It was a good move. This is simple to use and she's having a great time with it, making fun music riffs. It won't let her become a serious composer, but that was not our goal."
1,twice bitten,this is the second time I've bought this software and the second time it wont open on any of the computers I have (3 of them). I bought the sony version and gave it to my nephew and it worked fine.
1,"doesn't work with Vista, no help from Sony","Wish I could use this program, but it doesn't work with Vista, and Sony couldn't help me! The fix they recommended didn't help, and they had no other suggestions. Don't buy it unless you have XP or earlier."
1,"won't install, no tech support",I bought this product for my son after he was introduced to it through a school project. After installing it I was unable to register the product and therefore it wouldn't run. After hours of searching I found a registration update and was successful at registering it. But it would crash whenever it would launch. I contacted their technical support and have been waiting almost a month to hear from them! It won't run on XP (although it's supposed to) and technical support is non-existent. Save your money and the headaches.
4,Excellent book BUT beware of the Kindle edition,"I got this book as a Kindle download, but in the end had to get the paper edition instead. Reference books you want to flip through are not the best choice for Kindle. Also, the book was apparently digitized with a scanner and little proofreading because accented characters show up all sorts of strange ways.For example ""más"" with an accented ""á"" shows up in the text in various ways like: ""mas"", ""m6s"", ""m3s"", ""mOs"", among others. ""está"" often shows up as ""est6"", and so on.Needless to say you can't search for phrases with those words because ""más"" won't match ""m6s"", and also the keyboard does not support Spanish characters anyway, so searching is out of the question.Save yourself a lot of difficulty and get the paper edition."
4,Rare Not To Find Expressions,"This dictionary is an excellent reference. It's rare not to find an expression in here. However, I personally find it hard to understand at times because some translations are grouped together and you can't tell if you're still reading the translation or if it's moved on to another expression."
1,"Save your money, this is a flawed product.","Flawed prodeuct, sold on philips outlet for $19. USB 1.0 device. Flawed with errors.Save your time and frustration, don't buy."
2,Philips -- LISTEN UP,"You have a _great_ product here. I loved having it. The sound is good, and rechargeable batteries make it so convenient.You need to do two things with this product:1) Allow music to come from a SD card2) Use USB 2.0Then you will have a winner and I'd definitely get one.I returned mine."
4,Great Sound In A Small Package,"I just recently bought this at CircuitCity for $79.99.The sound will knock your socks off. Considering the size of the speakers, you will not believe your ears.It is perfect for my use on my school bus.The FM is a little weak, but I use WMA's mostly.If they would make this with maybe a 1 gig or 2 gig, it would be unbeatable. The 256 is a little lite, but for the price, I LOVE it!"
5,The quality and sound of the speakers alone is worth the price,The quality and sound of the speakers alone is worth the price. After almost 10 years of use and abuse I had to replace the first one I had. It is used primarily as a speaker for an XM or other external source. The speaker is capable of EXTREMELY high volume and sound pressure (with no noticeable distortion) depending on the source used. The design is about a decade old and unchanged. That's why a small internal memory and no SD card slot and bad software. I only care about the speaker sound. If it was updated to today's standards and used for 2 or 3 years it would be OUTDATED AGAIN. IT IS PRIMARILY AN EXTERNAL SPEAKER SYSTEM (the only technology that doesn't change every year). What did computers look like when this was designed. If you want the best sounding speakers for this size and price BUY IT. If you want an ALL IN ONE audio device don't bother. And stop dreaming with unrealistic expectations.
5,fair quality and low price...,"I'm very satisfied with this product. It works smoothly and hasn't had any problems with me so far. But I don't recommend it for inexperienced or fastidious users, because on the ""soft"" part, it needs to be treated carefully. For example, it malfunctions if you don't ""safely remove"" from the computer, you will have to reconnect and re-remove. However, other than that, it has no serious issues. It can be said to be one of the best portable speakers.Noted for potential users: The music managing software attached to the product (Musicmatch) has been out of date. Instead, you should use freeware ""Shoqbox Buddy"", compatible with Vista."
3,Does not work with Vista,"Do not buy this if you have Vista unless you only want it for a fm radio and/or a speaker to use with a seperate mp3 player. You will not be able to put music on it with a newer operating system than xp. I found out the hard way. Otherwise it's awesome, the sound is as good as an old fashioned boombox, in a much more compact size. The radio comes in very well. I only give it 3 stars because in my opinion there should be an upgrade or an accessory for the product to make it compatible with newer operating systems."
1,Rented it,This was about an hour and a half that I am not getting back. Not to mention the $2.99 I spent to rent it.
1,Waste of Money,"Quit working after 2 months. Changed batteries, very sporatic display. No troubleshooting available in the instructions or on line. Thumbs down."
1,Buyer Beware,This lamp arrived yesterday and 30 seconds after opening it I threw it in the garbage.It is very flimsy and needs a specialty light bulb which it does not come with. I thought I was getting a normal lamp which would take a normal light bulb.The ad was VERY misleading. This lamp was a complete ripoff.
4,Soft Lighting,"I actually ordered the natural colored lamp. It gives a soft glow. We use it on a timer in the entry way, so it won't be pitch black when we come in. Very lovely!"
2,Reads like a fable rather than a novel and failed to engage me,"This is another of those books I'd always known about and finally got around to reading only to be disappointed. German author Patrick Süskind's novel was a huge bestseller around the world when it came out in 1985. Set in 18th century France, it's the story of a man born without a personal odor but with a perfect sense of smell who becomes a perfumer and murderer who kills young virgins for their scent. The depiction of the time and place is vivid, but the characters are flat. It reads like a fable rather than a novel and failed to engage me enough to pull me into a fictional dream. Instead I felt distant and almost clinical in my reading. In order for any novel to work for me, there must be a character to care about, something Perfume lacked."
1,Inverosímil y absurdo dislate bien narrado,"Un asesino con el olfato inusualmente fino se dedica a estrujar mujeres como limones con la finalidad de extraerles su aromático aceite esencial para su deleite nasal.Es una pena que el autor desperdicie su talento narrativo en una obra que, pretendiendo ser realista, tiene el que probablemente sea el argumento más absurdo de todos los tiempos.Suskind escribe bien, sólo así se soporta tamaña tontería, pero probablemente no tenga imaginación suficiente para crear una historia propia y consistente y sea verdad que plagió el argumento de la historia de otro autor, habiendo llegado a sus manos siendo lector de libros en una editorial. Quizá por ello el desenlace de esta historia riza el rizo de lo absurdo.No lo recomiendo ni comprendo su éxito."
2,Wrong Edition,You sent me the 2001 edition instead of the 2006 edition that is in the product description the cover is completly diferent. Basically I am happy with the book but is not the edition you announce and the one I want.
3,Good but not great,"This book was a bit disappointing. It's divided into four parts. Part I was absolutely amazing...I couldn't put the book down. Part II kind of dragged, as did the first half of Part III. Then by Part IV, I was completely blown away by the twists and turns that occurred at the end of the book, which were a bit morbid even for my taste (and I am definitely no prude). It's unfortunate because the writing itself is epic and beautiful, but the story just doesn't tie together very well. Perhaps it's better in the original German."
5,Good.....very good,.. How do you hype up a band that been around so long.. with such a great sound.. It is a very wonderful record.
4,FUGAZI'S LAST GREAT,"IT SEEMS THAT THIS WAS THE LAST GREAT WORK BY FUGAZI. I WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH ANY OF THEIR OTHER RELEASES AFTER THIS ONE CAME OUT. I RATE THIS CD, JUST SHORT OF THE '5'STARS."
5,their best album,fugazi really sounds raw and so togather on this album.this by far is their fastest and heaviest album they've put out.their best work ever!!!!
2,a very very very rare miss,I love fugazi they are one of my all time favorite bands and imo one of the most talented bands on this planet and that is why i am so dissapointed with this album the first two songs are ok but after that the album just goes downhill all the songs mainly just sound like straight forward verse chorus verse chorus boring songs that you can hear from any other indie band they dont at all show the bands creativity and usually progressive nature i give it two stars becuase it sais fugazi on it and that in itself is respectable but i think its safe to say that this is that one record that all bands put out that just isnt that good if you wanna listen to some mindblowing music check out red medicine and end hits
5,MY ANSER,I THINK THAT THIS GAME IS GOOD BECAUSE YOU DONT HAVE TO KEEP PUTING AND THE GAMES YOU CAN JUST HIT THE BUTTON ON THE REMOKECANTROLE ON i THINK THIS PRODUCE IS GOOD.
4,Seller is wonderful,"Seller is absolutely amazing to work with; however, the capo is quite a bit bulky, and the thumbscrew a bit hard to turn. The functionality of the capo is good. I recommend this purchase if you would like a budget capo. If you are someone who relies on the capo to serve well during a performance, I recommend investing a little more money."
5,Good Product,I have not used it yet as it is part of what I am saving for future use. It seems to pack well.
4,tight!!,This CD was tight and had some heavy beats for 91/92. Hav & prod can flow really well too. Their rhymes were more uptempo on this than the later stuff. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the REAL westcoast rap. Peace!
4,Pretty good,"I was in despepate need for help reading ""The Catcher in the Rye"" even though it was a good book. I read Cliffs note and I read this. Personally I thought this helped me out more."
4,better than most other high school book notes,"Like most other high school book notes, this book spends much of the time on plot summary.There are, however, a few theories and insights which I have not found anywhere else:--Breath is a symbol of the spirit. Holden is out of breath from smoking, Hold accidentally blows cigarette smoke into the nuns' faces, and the maid breathes on the family food.--The cap is a consolation prize for failure.--Holden has greater respect for those whose religious beliefs are inconvenient. That's why he thinks highly of the nuns, but comments disparagingly of the philanthropist undertaker, ""I can just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs."""
4,tha catcher in the rye,"The catcher in the rye is a great book teenage people should read, This book is a classic for many reasons. One important is the fact how easily people can relate to the character (Holden) in the book Holden often expresses his confusion and loneliness throughout the story, which many teens can look back on and relate. The story happens in new York city in a period of 4 days .I truly recommend this book because I loved the way Sallinger wrote it making everything so real and the way he describes everything .He makes the reader relate to the story that is what makes it so special."
4,Repeater!,"Again we are treated to an outstanding album by Fugazi, this is just nothing short of brilliant and more than just for the collection. If your feeling mad or glad either way you will be feeling sound after a blast from this little beauty!"
4,Red Medicine,"Red Medicine is the album I personally always over look and forget when it comes to Fugazi's work. But once I do listen I am reminded why this is such a great album.The only gripe is going to be placed right out front, nothing on the album really stands out among the groups canon of music other than a few tracks. Thats not to say the rest is weak or anything because it is anything but.Red Medicine is very riff heavy, which I love about it. Some of the greatest guitar work by the band can be found here on Red Medicine, like 'Bed For The Scraping' and 'Latest Disgrace.' McKaye's lyrics and vocals are some of the best of his carer on Red Medicine. Just give 'Birthday Pony' a listen.Red Medicine is a unique album in the Fugazi canon and one that really has to be heard to appreciated."
2,I find it unreadable,"I do not understand why the author is trying to accomplish. He starts with page after page of description of how we should define bourgeois. He misses out the big picture by failing to present any information about standards of living. Instead he goes into pedantic details about what lots of people have said about the matter. And he does not have a personal opinion so he does not conclude, just moves on to the next section. In the end one wonders how this relates to the big theme of the book. The book continues in a similar style. Some people might consider the language learned, but I consider it stilted. Sentences regularly run into five or six lines (and the font size is not big). This is English, not German! The book belongs to another.When I read non-fiction I want to get a clear message from the author and it is also a bonus if I am entertained. In this case I am neither. I give the book two stars because the author has clearly put in a lot of time into producing the book."
5,I Put Away My Idols/Kingdom in the Street ~Dion,Better than Dion's first. Great to share with friends.
5,Great music from a great singer and honest spirituality,"First of all this is very good music and full of excellent performances .I mean song like ""They won't tell you "" deserve to be heard today as examples of real good craftmanship in songwriting . This song keep you interested all along. ""My prayer for you "" is beautiful beyond words and so simple . Simplicity and truth , real good music.The songs in ""I put away my idols "" are really , really very inspired.""Kingdom in the streets "" is a fine record too so there is a change in sound , but Dion shows that he is a rocker second to none and deliver some fantastic ballad performances in ""Come to the cross "" and ""He's in you "".I recomend to anyone the 4 gospel records by Dion or I would saythe 5 . You won't regret at all to listen to these records . And in the process you will lear something about how to be an honest artist .The gospel legacy of Dion will stand the test of time....wait and see"
5,I Put Away My Idols,"This is the BEST CD EVER.It was given to me years ago on cassette tape and it broke. I bought another one and LOST it and haven't been able to find one since. So when I saw this on Amazon, I grabbed it! Only disappointment is that the case was broken."
3,the mill of old french horror,"I don't need to go over the plot except to say that it isa descendant of 'the house of wax"" , with other elements thrown inincluding a mad doctor and a ever dying woman. It's vintage gothic horror and my disc worked fine. The print is pretty good shape with a few defects but not too distracting like many other old movies with truly shoddy prints. This movie is gothic horror all the way and it's atmospheric and has good performances from the cast and features one semi nude scene that was slashed when shown in the U.S. and U.K. but it is here untouched. This is for fans of older slower moving gothic movies with great set pieces like hands coming from the wall and statues everywhere. If you are in the mood for this type of horror film which is still good all these years later then you will enjoy this movie."
4,The Mill Fits the Bill,From the onset you can clearly see that this unheralded and unheard of movie is several cuts above the nomal horror movies Past or Present. Superb acting intilligent plot Great Soundtrack and camera work.This is a must see this film if you enjoy horror check it out.
3,"great movie, but DVD could be better","i have been waiting anxiously to get this - i finally watched it - great movie - very surreal, nightmarish and scary - beautiful women - the movie gets 5 stars - fires on all cylinders - but the disc/dvd could have been better - 2 big problems that take me right out of the joy of watching the movie - first, i like watching it in french with subtitles (because the english dubs are ok but feel very unnatural) - unfortunately the french language audio track will without warnig quit and switch over to the english - usually during a chapter change - second, the picture freezes and stutters for about 2 seconds as chapter 16 quits and chapter 17 starts - the disc looks flawless - no scratches or blemishes - so im left wondering - is this just shoddy work on the pressing end or did i get a lemon? - if i send it back for a replacement will that also be flawed? - has anyone else run into this - i ordered mine from amazon directly - whats the deal?"
2,Far from a classic,"After reading all of the four and five star reviews I was really looking forward to this forgotten ""classic"". I watched the film last night and started to wonder if I saw the same movie everyone else saw. Sure theres some moody photography and a pretty descent score but the story itself was second rate and unoriginal I might add. There were a few creepy moments but there was alot of talky moments as well. If you never get a chance to see this your really not missing much."
3,Obscure film - and with good reason,"Not much to offer here. This is tough going until the end, and the final ""pay off"" we waited for (re: dinosaurs & destruction) is pathetically weak at best. James Arness shows up for his paycheck and that's about it. His brother, Peter Graves, had to live with ""Killers From Space"" on his acting credits and James had this mess. We all have our crosses to bear, I suppose. Video & audio quality are okay. If you can get it for a few bucks then okay, otherwise forget it. There are much better b-film dino movies out there that are truly deserving of your attention. This ain't one of them."
1,Truly awful,"I'm a serious fan of the cheesiest old black-and-white monster flicks. I typically sort my lists starting from the cheapest - and so when this one popped up, I bought it. OK, you get what you pay for. Awful. Awful. Awful. Or maybe just boring, boring boring. Where are the dinosaurs? Where is the 'spectacle'. Basically a pseudo western soap opera of the TV kind - that just happens to have James Arness lurking somewhere in the cast (definitely not 'starring'). I tried to give it No Stars - but the system wouldn't let me."
3,Rare Woody Allen Biography,"This is the book that Woody Allen sued to keep off the shelves. The author has presented a mixed bag of a biography, filled with inaccuracies and confusion, but also containing a significant amount of material from Mr. Allen's standup comedy act, his film scripts and other written works. Much of the material is published in no other place. Soon after the book was released, Mr. Allen sued the publisher and gained a quick judgement that the book should be destroyed, with unsold copies recalled from stores and that efforts should be made to return sold copies as well."
5,Meaning with humour,"I am delighted to have Dharma the Cat in a printed format. I have used the online version with my undergraduate and postgraduate students for several years. I have found that they appeal to a wide range of people who laugh at the behaviour of the earnest monk, Boddhi but also comment on the wisdom of the cat. It is good to explore meaning in a way that does not take itself too seriously and is able to cross the boundaries of age and religion. The drawings are good fun and the dialogue is so human that we all can identify with it."
4,compulsive cult reader,"This is some piece of work. very graphic, Very visual. I've read quite a few offbeat books and with many of them the happenings in the story are limited by the words or it's so wordy you kind of lose the feel for it... in this book you actually SEE the violence (and yes, it is violent) occuring. I'd have to say that I like this book, partly because of the sick (...) subject matter, partly because of the writing (he obviously has no regard for classic literature... and I love it!) it moves pretty fast and that's good because too much of it would be just that.. too much. It ends right about when it should. I do have to ad that this story may not be for the faint of heart or the squeemish - and still with that being said I give it two thumbs up -"
3,"Not bad, but could have been better...","For an intro to ASP, I found it useful. An easy intro into an area that was initially daunting to me. However, I can agree with a lot of the comments made previously. Explanations of many examples are poor, and there are a few mistakes in some of the code.If you're up on your VBScript, look elsewhere, if not, learn it first.I wouldn't go as far as asking for my money back, but if you're looking for the perfect intro to ASP...it 'aint it !"
2,Confusing,"I read as far as mid-Day 2. I was so confused by the poor writing, I wrote and asked for a refund. I would guess he knows the subject, but how did this thing get beyond the proof readers? I'm looking for another book on the subject."
3,"This book is... well, OK","This book is good for someone whom knows nothing about ASP. Although I agree with many of the comments so far, I have learned a great deal of information from this book. I've already read it once and am in the process of re-reading so I can pickup things I missed the first time around. For what it is worth, I just ordered the ""Professional: ASP"" book to suppliment my skill."
2,Avoid this disappointing book,"If you are an ASP beginner, ""Teach Yourself ASP in 24 Hours"" may be a better start.This book is poorly written. There is some useful code, but the author does a poor job at explaining what the code does. After reading the book you are bound to ask yourself, ""What on earth did I just learn?"" The answer: nothing. You will most likely need another book to start all over again."
2,The author fails to explain the codes clearly.,"This book is not completely for the beginners. First couple days are still reasonable to understand; however, on the fifth, sixth, and seventh days, it is getting really difficult to understand what the author is trying to do. He doesn't give clear explantion on the codes. This book is not suitable for the tittle itself."
1,I want my money back!,"If you really want to learn ASP, buy WROX ASP series. This book is the worst computer-related book I've ever bought. The author has no skill in explaining to beginners. The words he uses are so wordy, and he provides absolutely no reference. The examples are long(some are 800 lines long) and complex, but the analysis is very short and poor. Also, he assumes the readers already know VBScript and JScript. Don't expect to learn ASP with this book in ""21 days"". You won't be able to learn ASP forever if you are planning to study with only this book."
1,terribly written book,"I have been working in computer field for 16 years and this book is one of the worst books I have bought. I stopped at middle of chapter 2 and could not go on. The author's writing skill and organization skill seems to be very low. Starting from the beginning of the book, the author uses long and unexplained examples. Large part of the book is made of long programs without careful explanation. It seems that the author was too busy to create some clear and simple examples. After all, I had to buy another book. So If you care about your time and money, don't buy this book."
3,Aimed at the beginner,"Reading more like an advertisement for Microsoft products than a comprehensive guide to programming in ASP this book is aimed squarely at the beginner market. If you have programming experience, are annoyed by blatent advertising or are more advanced in ASP then skip this one and look for a more in-depth title. The content of this book is disappointing. Why devote a whole chapter to Visual Inter-Dev in a book about ASP when databases are only covered in the most basic terms?"
1,Complete Garbage!!!,"I bought this book to obviously learn how to code Active Server Pages, what I got was a book with too many coding errors. The Author explains in the beginning of the book how some debugging was sacrificed. I went through the first six days, and not one program worked! I am so upset with this book that I want Sanjaya Hettihewa to personally apologize for this ""book"", and give me my money back with interest. If I could give this book negative stars, I would. If you learn by doing, this book is an absolute must miss."
5,I love it!,I have been using this book since the beggining of my ASP experiances and continue to use this book. Great examples! Good organization! All the right Content! And plenty of stuff to get ingulfed in!
3,Very good Bosa Nova singer,"I've purchased this album because I liked her song ""Nao Vou Fugir"" in the Siddharta: Spirit of Buddha-bar Vol. 3. Few songs in this album are very nice, if you like Bebel Gilberto and other traditional Bosa Nova music."
3,Lasted for the season.,"It lasted for about 9 months. That's probably 2-3 months longer than it should have, I kept trimming it with scissors in order to make it last till Thanksgiving week. I don't fly my flags from December to early March.While the flag gets shredded on the end, the grommets held strong (some rust). The flag is faded pretty well, my poles get full sun all day.I will be buying a new flag for next year."
1,I read this book and then threw it away.,"""Around We Go"" was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. I must not have read the reviews...when one has to fight with an Author's gramatical errors and unsure story lines, why bother? After I finished this book, I threw it away (into the recycling bin).I did read the entire book...I think out of amazement that a book of this caliber could be not only published, but sold for $18.95(approximately).The only other use I can think for this book is very expensive firewood."
2,Not as great as all the unidentified reviews here say,"I should have known not to trust all the reviews written here. They raved so much about the book I thought I'd take a chance. No wonder there is no book description, no professional reviews and no excerpt. Don't go on the reviews only. The book is not badly written, but it's not well-written either. Most of the time the characters are like cardboard. There are some good parts, and the plot is all right for a romance, but it tends to be overwritten and full of flowery purple prose. The sex scenes are not erotica but are over the top. Some people like that alot I guess, but I prefer the solid clear writing of authors like Karin Kallmaker, Frankie Jones, LJ Maas, and Saxon Bennett. Sorry to say, there's a good chance you'll be wasting $$ plus postage if you buy this book."
5,I want MORE!!!!,"Around We Go is without a doubt the best book that I have read in years. The characters are vibrantly alive in my mind and heart. Ms.Chatelaine has a gift for drawing you into the lives of her characters. The emotions were such that I could relate and actually feel right along with the story. I laughed and cried.....I even cursed the author for the many unexpected twists and turns. I await the second novel with impatient, but eager anticipation. More, More, More!!!!! Look out Hollywood! This could be your hottest television series ever!!!!!"
3,Light of God,"John Coster is a good songwriter. His music is original and deep. His greatest challenge is his voice, which is a bit thin -- maybe like a slightly more musical Leonard Cohen. ""Everywhere I Go"" has a pretty melody and inspirational lyrics, ""Everywhere I go, see the people, I hear them crying; Everywhere I go, see the light of God left shining; Everywhere I go the darkness falls; Everywhere I go an angel calls."" The CD concludes with ""Revolutionary,"" a stark ballad. Recorded at a private residence, the sound quality on this independent release is quite good. If you can acquire the taste for Coster's voice, the music will entertain. Enjoy!"
5,"Clear & Knowledgeable, Healed & Restored","I read this book because of a recommendation from my associate pastor. Needless to say, I learned a lot about myself and why I had homosexual tendencies and thoughts at a young age.This book explains the reasons why people are gay and tend to be drawn to that sin instead of another.It's a very practical and spiritual book that balances out the two very well!! I never had a sexual experience with a man, but understand how that very act can ground you into believing you are infact this very sin.It's very gentle in nature the way it's written. The author really understand the homosexual and the problems they have faced. He himself has seen people come out of this sin never to look back again.I praise God that this information is available. For you sceptics out there I challenge you to read this book with an open heart, honesty to yourself, and a clear mind. You will learn and understand more about homosexuality more than ever before."
1,This Book is a Crock,"There is no such thing as curing homosexuality. Homosexuality is not a disease. All that such ""therapy"" does is harm those who seek it."
2,Weak,"I won't repeat the review by Publisher's Weekly (above under Editorial Reviews) but will only add that it sums up this unfortunate mystery quite well. This book is an ""airport read"" in every way, with a plot that opts for the gruesome, sexy, and conspiratorial (of the usual government cover-up variety) over solid plotting and good writing at every turn. The descriptions of today's China are the only bright spots."
1,disappointing,"I gave this book only one star because it only had one good story in it. It is three books in one and the one by Jess Michaels was the only one worth reading. I tried to read the second one but finally had to give up. The third story was only fair. I confess though that I bought it because of the price; and although I have read some fairly good books at a low price, this is not one that I would recommend."
1,YUCK!,"Very very bad, especially the 2nd story ""Parlor Games"", it wasn't sexy or erotic- the couple didn't even like each other - then they loved each other -huh? The other 2 stories were okay, the 3rd being the best because I like highlanders, but it was rushed because it was a short story. This wasn't worth my time."
3,Good stories,Somewhat disappointing. I would still recommend it to those readers of erotic romance. its still a somewhat good read. enjoy.
5,"Amazing, absorbing, human, beautiful...","This is one the best novels I have ever read in my life. It was totally absorbing. It paints a powerful portrait of life, love, suffering, human relations, etc. -- its themes are deeply universal. The book tells the story of life about 100 years ago in a small rural fishing village on the coast of Denmark -- it explores the lives of the men and women who struggle there. It also offers the best analysis of lived religion that I have ever come across in literature. I couldn't put it down. A world classic, for sure."
3,So-so CJ text,"This text was ok, a lot better written than most of the criminal justice texts I've had to study from. There are the basic land mark cases and some other related cases for each amendment, though I would have liked to see more on the first and second."
4,These guys are the BOMB!,"Saw these guys in Atlanta and they are smoking hot! Each song is better than the next. Anthems, huge sound, original lyrics genius,...Mind-blowing guitar work! Listen to a few songs first, you'll see what I mean. They blew everyone away and with the right exposure, they will be the nnext big thing!"
5,Their best live record!,"Recorded live in a German TV studio in 1975. Their only live album with all three original members. It catches them in their prime. Dewey Bunnell and Dan Peek dominate the performance. Hits like Horse With No Name, I Need You, Ventura Highway, Don't Cross The River, and Lonely People are very well done. This is the best vesion of Tin Man that I have ever heard. Also has very powerful renditions of Moon Song, California Revisited, and Green Monkey."
5,CLASSIC ROCK!!!,"If you enjoy classic rock, this is the America album for you. Recorded when they were in their youthful prime, this album is more proof that America could really rock. Comes with both an audio and video CD, so you can watch the performance on your PC."
2,ho-hum,"I am reviewing this book because no one else has. I ordered it because I am a sucker for Halloween-themed books. I have to say, this is a rather ho-hum and tedious book. Spoiler alert- kids are trick-or-treating, meet their friends, their cat goes up ""Haunted Hill"" and as it turns out, there is only a harmless old lady living up there. A sort of twist occurs when the old lady say the ghosts now live down below the hill. Overall, the language and story will probably not keep the interest of children or their parents."
3,Good As Far As It Goes,"The authors are EMT's and have had wilderness experience. The book is similar to a number of other books on basic wilderness first aid but is lacking in at least a couple of areas. Various ways of making an improvised stretcher (litter) were not covered. Getting help and communicating with SAR is not covered. What is covered is all patient assessment and standard first aid as is protocol for EMT's. I was disappointed there wasn't more application to wilderness situations. ""Medicine for the Outdoors"" by Paul s. Auerbach is far more complete and deals better with the harsh realities you face with medical issues in the wilderness. I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because it might be a starting place for someone with little experience in first aid. I would also like to see these types of books talk about prevention, at very least as an introduction to the topic."
2,Laser level,On the plus side:I love the extremely strong magnet and the fact that the vial lights up when the laser is turned on. On the minus side: I am not sure just how accurate the large vial really is. I checked it on the bed of a large Lathe and is was not 100% accurate.
1,Don't Buy It...Waste of Money,"We bought our son the GameBoy Advance SP and this starter kit for Christmas. The starter kit is terrible. The screen covers are horribly waxy (making them useless)and were thrown out right away, the game case completely covers the left/right buttons and the charger/cable entries in the back of the game and make it very difficult to get to the side controls (volume/on & off), the magnifiying glass is ridiculous, there is very little difference and it is very difficult to install/remove.The only items worth it in this kit are the desktop charger (not so necessary, but a nice idea), the two game cases (each hold 2 games), and the little screw driver for the battery door, and the extra battery. Buy those separately."
2,"Good Product, Bad Price","Over all it's a very good product, easy to swallow and no fishy taste but the problem is the price. I bought these here on Amazon at the time of purchase they were 13 dollars. The Kirkland Brand is a Costco brand and at the Costco stores these same pills with the same count costs only 8 dollars! I suppose if you don't have a Costco membership this is a good price, but if you do or know anyone who does go to Costco either pick them up yourself from there or ask someone you know who has a Costco membership to get them for you."
2,good price but capsules were stuck together,"I bought these because I thought they were a good price. However, the capsules were stuck together and I finally had to cut open the container and pry them apart and put them into another container. Too much hassle to risk ordering again."
5,Real Deal,I have tried fish oil in the past and have not liked the side effects.....burping and the smell. This brand doesn't have the same side effects....in fact no side effects at all. I will continue to use this brand. This product was shipped as advertised. OUTSTANDING!
4,good for eyes,"I have macular degeneration. This is a fine and affordable helper. Also good for brains, I think."
1,Vital Information Missing From Label,"The label does not list the EPA and DHA levels. I started taking Nature Made Fish Oil after a high cholesterol reading; six months later, all levels were great. I switched to Kirkland (because the price was lower) about 5 months ago. Labs came back today, and my bad cholesterol is up and the good cholesterol is down. I looked up the DHA & EPA levels for Kirkland and found that they were less than half of what I had been taking with Nature Made. Now I know why Kirkland doesn't list the amounts of DHA & EPA levels; you have to take twice as many to get the same amount as Nature Made. There are better alternatives out there. Won't buy this again."
5,Great product,"Great deal and great product. I bought 2 bottles and the expiration dates were good 3 years away, so it was no problem with the product going old. It did have a little bit of fish smell to it at first but I got used to it within a few days. I would recommend this to my friends."
5,Happy,It does works well and I am very satisfied. I would order this product and tell other friends about it.
1,Caution! Contains SOY!!!,Who knew! No where does it say soy until I'd been taking these for a matter of weeks and watched my inflammation symptoms INCREASING again! Then I thought to look at the label. Contains soy! My body doesn't like soy. Tossed the rest of the bottle
1,These soft gels come stuck together! Avoid.,These gels came all stuck together. I only had them for a week and while I was trying to take one out it popped open and all the fish oil fell out. The smell stayed and made the whole package unbearable so I had to dump it out. Waste of money. Never buying these again.
1,price on this item,"This may be a good product, but if you go to a Costco store you will find it for a little over eight dollars. You do have to be a member of the store to shop there, and as I do, and if I like the product, I will purchase it there."
2,watch out for rancid oil in capsules,"Be sure to check the sell by date. Fish oil does not have a very long shelf life. Fresh fish oil has a light lemony smell which fades quickly as the oil ages.You can tell if the fish oil is rancid by the fishy smell coming from the bottle when you open it. The stronger the smell the more rancid the oil.Also, if you keep the bottle in the refrigerator, which you should, the oil is rancid if the cold capsules have, or develop, white flaky looking spots inside. If you break open one of those capsules you will smell the strong fishy odor of the rancid oil as it warms up.I gave this product a two star rating because two of the last three bottles of Kirkland fish oil I have purchased had rancid oil in some or most of the capsules. I even ate some from a new freshly opened bottle and got sick to my stomach before I realized that the oil was bad."
5,For my puppy,"I purchased these for my puppy. She has dry skin, flakes, and now she has mange that we are treating with Ivermectin.This has made such a difference in her coat!I pop 1 capsule (probably will be 2 when she is fully grown) with a sewing needle and squirt the oil in her morning feed.She eats the food and the oil does not bother her, she likes it I think!I definitional recommend for your dogs, if they have excessive itching from allergies or dry skin!"
1,NOT Tested by IFOS,"Until this product is submitted to the International Fish Oil Standards group for periodic validation I can't recommend this to anyone. If you are looking for a high quality Omega-3 Fish Oil supplement start here:(...).ifosprogram.comBrands listed on the IFOS Website have been tested to determine if the contents match the label. In addition the test results reveal if the product has safe levels of Mercury, Lead, Arsenic, and Cadmium (which can be present in fish) according to CRN/GOED standards."
2,kirkland omega 3,did is not a best deal......400 gels with almost nothing inside = 180 super strengh 500 dha/ 300 epa each
5,Excellent,"The bottle is totally new, never open, i bought 2 and is really good, dont have problem with nothing, the date to expire is very long and the bottles come to me quickly"
5,Can't beat this!,"Great product. Very happy! Just remember these pills are 1000mg but only contain 300mg of fish oil in each pill!! Read labels! So in order to get 1200mg of omegas that you need a day you should be taking four pills a day. Two in morning, two with lunch."
5,Love those Omegas,"For starters, this is a big ass bottle, literally, its a huge bottle, not saying that is a negative I'm just pointing that out. This recommends 3 soft gels per day. I've had other brands that say 2 per day. Who is right, I dont know. Each is a 1000mg gel and contains 300mg of the good stuff just like every other fish oil capsule Ive bought so I'll take 3 i guess. For the price you cant go wrong. I'll take the 3 a day it recommends just so I can finish the bottle faster. 400 capsules...challenge accepted!Update: 12/2/125 weeks in and so far so good. I am taking 3 of these in the morning with a little breakfast and to my count, ZERO ""fish burps"". Forgot to mention the expiration date in my original review. I received a bottle with a 8/2015 date. Almost 3 years into the future, I imagine that is pretty good right?"
2,"Whatever you do, don't burp!","The cost can't be beat. But the fishy burps that can occur after are FOUL. If you don't mind that, then these are for you. I've decided that, while these vitamins are good for you and cost effective, the discomfort of fishy burps is too uncomfortable for me and I have to switch back to my more expensive brand. But if you're OK with that, these are definitely a bargain!"
1,Glob,When I received this huge bottle of pills they were all stuck together. Apparently they had been heated and they had all melted. Nothing could be saved from this order. I want my money back!
2,Cheaper at Costco,Costco sells this exact same product for $5 less. Amazon is great but this is an instance where Costco undersells Amazon.
5,"Great brand , great price and very speedy delivery",I got this great brand for a very good price in a remarkably fast time
2,Only 300mg Omega-3,"Read the front of the bottle carefully.The softgels has 1000mg fish oil but only 300mg Omega-3 fatty acids. My doctor advised me to consume 3000mg Omega-3 per day. I bought this product assuming it's 1000mg but to find out the actual fatty acids is only 300mg. That means I have to take 10 softgels each day.I think I have to find another brand, any recommendations?"
4,I suppose it works,"Its claimed to be fish oil with lots of omvega 3. And I would suppose that it is and does the things that Omega 3 supplements are supposed to do. I'm not noticing the fishy after taste from this one that I usually get so that's the plus that had me rating this higher than a 3. The price was good and so was the shipping as they all got here fine. I'm keeping this on the shopping list, even though I can't really tell if they are effective."
4,Good Item,"It is the one which, I have been looking for, I am completely satisfied. I will buy this item in future too."
4,Great Product,"This product contains 400 tablets which is reasonable for the price. Would purchase this product again, excellent buy. Great value for the price."
4,"No idea yet, but it seems cool","Yellowish liquid pill. easy to swallow, no crazy taste like people said. big bulk for so cheap. idk what to say."
5,I am confused,#1 in Pet Supplies > Dogs > Health Supplies > Supplements & Vitamins > Fish Oil SupplementsIs this for human?
3,Fish oil plus,"I purchased this product because it is at an unbelievable price and also they use wild salmon, not farm-raised, and distill it to remove the toxins. I only rate it 3 stars because when I read the ingredients, it sounds normal, but then it says, ""CONTAINS: FISH (Anchovy and Sardines) and Soy."" I avoid soy products at all costs and would not have purchased this had I known. GMO soy has insidiously found its way into most of our food supply; I don't want any in my food or my vitamins!"
4,gives my dogs a great coat,"i purchased this for my pets, on the advice of my vet. it made their coats nice and shiny and healthy."
2,Too Fishy!,"These are a very good value, but I stopped taking them as they were just too fishy tasting. Fishy burps are disgusting. My husband (he's a physiologist) suggested that I switch to an algae based DHA supplement, so I did. I'm now taking DEVA Vegan Omega-3 DHA derived from algae. No more fishy side effects. I won't be buying these again."
4,A great value,"Not the best fish oil product, given the aftermath, but certainly a great price for a large quantity with an impressive shelf life."
2,Been taking this to regulate my mood with no effect!,I was recommended to try fish oil to help give me a more positive and calm mood throughout the day. This product has absolutely no effect on me and I have been taking it for about two months now
5,Costco sells them for $9,"The product is great and is good for you, but you can get this exact product from Costco for only $9!Kirkland is a Costco brand so just head to your nearest Costco if you have a membership there and save some money and time."
5,a bit overpriced here... nearly half price at costco...,"just so everyone knows. i was about to buy these here but noticed the brand and figured id check if costco has em. sure enough, they do and theyre like 8 something there for the same exact bottle. ill update this review after having taken them for a few weeks. ive never tried this stuff but ive heard great things."
5,fish oil,"I was told to start taking fish oil for all of the health benefits, and I shopped around quite a bit. This was the best price I could find. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Good Omega-3 Supplement - Highly Recommended,"Kirkland Fish Oil Concentrate Softgels are a great way to get Omega-3 into your diet. I decided to try these after reading about the many benefits of taking Fish Oil (better cholesterol numbers, improved memory, less joint pain, etc). While it is had to quantify exactly what effect supplements are having since I am also taking prescription medications, but my cholesterol numbers have significantly improved over the past three months and there is noticeably less pain in my knees.Just a note, Kirkland is the store brand of a major ""warehouse club"" and I have have always been pleased with the quality compared to national brands and generics.Highly Recommended!CFH"
3,some were leaky,"A couple leaked in shipment. THere are some more concentrated brands out there (i.e., more EPA/DHA per volume of oil/capsule) but they generally cost quite a bit more. Always do the math to find the cost of EPA/DHA per serving, and research to make sure the serving suggested actually corresponds to the therapeutic benefits you're after!"
2,Not as good as once thought...,"I had believed these were fantastic, especially considering the price. However, after reading the January 2012 issue of Consumer Reports, I learned that the Kirkland brand of fish oil pills did not meet the enteric-coating claim. Apparently, these can prematurely dissolve in your stomach instead of the small intestine, so you won't be receiving the full benefits. I'm switching to another brand which does meet the standards."
2,ehhh,Not too sure about the quality. Smells very fishy. However I've been taking fairly regularly for a month or more with no negative reaction. Occasional smell on my breath.
2,A stupid version of Suitcase,"This feels like an abandoned version of suitcase but yet since there are no other choices, extensis keeps it on the shelf.Basic functionality are there without consideration of how people actually work with font. You can see the fonts but cannot click on them and add it to another set.Very disappointed."
4,Great movie,"The first time I watched this movie, I followed the director's advice and watched the R Rated version first. I'm glad I did as the Unrated version was even funnier when you know what is added. If you watch the unrated version, you'll probably end up getting confused about what is being said or why something is happening."
4,Computing Millennium Teen Sexuality,"A funny story is depicting rude moments of the American young Jews, 16-17y.o., exploring their testosterone urges in occurring situations hilariously.A typically American comedy of melting-pot sex gratification ways multination country offers in the millennium telecommunication/computing affect dramatically.It is a very relaxing viewing for leaving the options open."
2,Sex Drive,Sex Drive is a 2008 sex comedy which I suppose is raunchy in the States. However coming from Europe were we are used to seeing movies that are much more sexual in content it was prudish and lame. The movie was a copy of 80's movies such as Porkys with the same kind of sex jokes and lame comments. Seth Green played a small roles but was the best and funniest in the movie. Not a terrible movie. Yet not that great. Not recommended. 2 out of 5.
4,Creme de la creme,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. The situations these characters get themselves in to is hilarious. I was expecting an American Pie rip-off, but was pleasently surprised. I loved the Amish country scenes as well as the Amish gone wild girls. This movie has all the laughs. If your not in to the Amish scenes who can not laugh at the mexican doughnut carrying a gun. The cops who beat the heck out of the mexican doughnut and I'm not making this up. There are hilarious scenes in this movie. This is not just a sex movie but a movie about friends finding love in all the wrong places. This is a cool little movie not intended for kids at all. If your an adult who can laugh at others misfortunes and not take things serious than this is a movie for you. This is for fans of American pie and Eurotrip. If you liked these movies than you will like this movie as well."
3,Product quality,"I was very excited and eager to get this movie. Unfortunately, I was unable to view it because it was scratched. I was not familiar with the process of return the product so I wasted my money on a bad product. booo!"
4,Hilarious movie!!!,Shipping not as fast as I would have liked. Movie arrived in new packaging as described. Have not viewed this item yet but rented the movie a few months ago and I couldn't contain my laughter!!!
2,Pretty lame movie,"I was hoping from the description that this would be a good sex comedy to own. Instead it turned out to be yet another lame teen movie with some extra sexual content thrown in. The video quality is good, but the plot is terrible."
3,It's a decent movie,"Had some funny parts to it, would watch again if I had nothing else to do. This is the unedited/ true fan version with a lot of goofy stuff. Probably would have preferred the theatrical version instead."
5,One of the funniest movies ever,"I saw this movie with some friends on tv and I just knew I had to buy it. It's a low brow comedy, one of those movies where you have to have a really good sense of humor to like. Lots of nudity, dirty jokes, just random silliness. It's awesome. Get high or a little drunk and watch it the first time, you'll piss your pants laughing. And yes I was buzzed the first time I saw it and yes I peed a little. Don't judge me."
4,Loved the unrated (for fans) version..whats the difference? Lots of added random filth..haha,"This was a great surprise for me. I thought it would be terrible, but it was pretty hilarious. Seth Green was great in his role also. If you are looking of a light, filthy, fun 'American Pie type' movie then this is it..The spoofy gratuitous and purposeful nakedness in the unrated version was great.Rent this if you are looking for a light comedy with dirty hilarity."
5,Awesome!,The product matched up perfect to the description. I recieved the product very quickly. i was a little nervous about ordering a movie online but it was perfect and i did not have any trouble playing the movie.
4,A joyful llama on the cover intrigues us!,"These folktales abound in stories of the cacique (headman of the village), the kalku (village sorcerer), the machi (the good sorcerer), the cuero (a fantastic creature), the chonchon (a form the kalku takes so it can fly through the night). The stories are varied: a russet cow's magic saves a boy and the boy's father and sister. A girl whose face has turned to stone gathers bones until she has enough for a whole skeleton--and miraculously, she is cured. A clever Princess will marry only someone whose riddle she cannot answer. A little tenca, a Chilean song bird, laments a burnt foot all through a cumulative tale only to find that her foot is well after all. And so it goes through 15 of these compelling stories."
3,Interesting but not a whole lot to it,I bought this book to engage my daughter who is doing prealgebra. The ideas are interesting but the questions tend to deal more with division and multiplication than requiring any degree of difficulty or intrigue to resolve. The book is rather short and the problems could be finished in a couple of days if the child has any degree of interest.
3,Could Be Better,"If you are a Red Sox fan you probably already have this DVD sitting on your bookshelf. The amazing antics of the 2004 Sox have killed ""The Curse"" for good and any fan would want to be able to relive this moment for the rest of their lives. The only problem that I really have with this DVD is how quickly they pass over the Yankees comeback, the true story of the 2004 Boston Red Sox. Not only did the Red Sox reverse the curse, they did it in the most imporbable, humiliating fashion against their hated arch-rivals. While the Cardinals series is the culmination of everything that the Red Sox had been striving for for the past 86 years, more should have been produced relating to the American League Championship.Still, this is an entertaining DVD and any Red Sox fans would be happy with even 5 minutes worth of footage talking about the Red Sox becoming World Series Champions.*** RECOMMENDED"
4,If your Red Sox fan. You just have to buy this right now,"If your Red Sox fan on planet Earth. I have a message for you buy this DVD it is just a must-have.For my point of view. I enjoy faith rewarded the NESN DVD more whereas my father enjoyed this one more. So you have to buy them both. This ones naration is done by Denis Leary, which I like a little better than the faith rewarded video, but it talks a lot about the curse of the Bambino. I mean tons whereas faith rewarded has none (okay one comment)So keep this in mind and enjoy the ride!Peace Out"
3,What about the ALCS?,Agree completely with Brian Lowery's comments. The World Series itself was not as exciting as the ALCS and the historic comeback from down 3-0 against the hated Yankees (speaking as a Sox fan). Let's get a DVD (or DVD set) that covers the ALCS as well as the World Series!
3,MLB should follow NFL's,"MLB should come out with DVD that encapsulates the entire season like the NFL has done for the World Champions each year...I have both the Pats DVD's and it gives a nice breakdown of each game (which you could not do for 162 regular season games) and then more detail into the playoff games, and then ultimately a larger portion to the Super Bowls.For the 2004 Red Sox, they should put something together that focuses more on the ALCS because of its bigger importance (down 3-0 to the Yanks), but still give a nice portion to the sweep of the Cardinals.I would not buy a DVD that just focused on the World Series...just my opinion.."
3,Eighty minutes!?,"That's all? 80 little minutes to cover the most momentous occasion in Red Sox history? How about three or four hours? How about a DVD covering highlights of the ENTIRE 2004 season? I'm not saying that they should put every minute of every game on DVD, but maybe we could cover the entire postseason at least. Highlights of the Angels vs. Sox. Cards vs. Dodgers. Sox vs. Yankees. Cards vs. Astros. How about including those wonderfully produced openings from Fox, including the ""Ignorance is Bliss"" skits with Millar and Damon. Hopefully, MLB will come out with a comprehensive DVD covering this great postseason, because to tell you the truth, the series was boring compared to the ALCS and NLCS matchups."
3,Download the MLB games instead,"While a thorough enough retrospective is unachievable here to die-hard Sox fans, the good news is you can download ALL the playoff games on mlb.com, for only $3.95 each. Then, you can burn them into DVD and watch and relive the details that are not available on this quick-hits DVD.The ""filmmakers"" of this thing want to think they made a ""film"" here, but it's just another highlights reel, mixed in with a few nondescript interviews with players.Let's hope for a more definitive Red Sox film in the future. This is nice to have in your collection, but it'll probably be played not once after the initial viewing by true fans."
1,What does this thing have to do with hockey???,"Try it, type ""hockey"" under DVD (new search) and this thing will appear on the 3rd or 4th page.Has Amazon lost its marbles, balls or pucks again?Why is it that when you type one thing, it takes you to another?A new selling scheme?Otherwise, this has nothing to do with a sport of finesse, grace, guts, power, skills and speed.. not to mention the coolest sport in the world."
1,Sappy. Let's pull out the violins,"Let's face it. This is a World Series highlights review. This should have been done with a baseball narrator. This should not have been made movie-like. That is better served by the forthcoming ""Faith Rewarded"" title. More proof that MLB productions will never even be in the same universe as NFL Films."
3,Red Sox,You can buy all the games from the playoffs from the MLB and watch them on your computer. They are not too expensive...
4,Not as Good as Faith Rewarded NESN,"Disclaimer: I am a Red Sox fan. If you are a Cards fan, well, you probably won't want to buy this anyway.This DVD is enjoyable, but I personally found the NESN video to be superior. The main difference is that the MLB version is a little more sanitized than the NESN one. For example, except for a very brief clip that's used in a transition, the MLB DVD makes no mention of The Slap by A-Rod. I interpret this as MLB not wanting to put one of their more marketable players in a bad light (even when he richly deserves it). The NESN video, on the other hand, does not hesitate to document this critical moment.Also, this video has a bit less material about the ALCS than the NESN video. But even the latter is too brief- that series deserves it's own DVD; I aged a good 5-10 years over the course of those 7 games.In sum, the NESN DVD (Faith Rewarded - The Historic Season of the 2004 Boston Red Sox) is a bit better than this one, but if you're a Red Sox fan, you'll want both."
2,WEAK,"I wish that there was a DVD out there with the GAMES. This is definetly worth watching, but I will probably not view it over and over. Good enough but not the best.I would love to see a DVD Boxed set of all of the ALCS and World Series games, throw in an option like Player voice over, Listen to WEEI instead of the Fox bozo's, maybe even chop down the games to about 1 to 1.5 hours each and sell it for a 100 bucks and I'd be much happier than with this particular DVD."
3,A Cardinal fans point of view,"If you are a Red Sox fan, you might like this a lot more. I just didn't like how very little focus was on the Cardinals, most was on the American League playoffs and VERY little about the actual World Series. I bought it anyway because even though we lost I still like the video for some reference of my team and the sport itself."
3,required reading,"Although this book is nearly twenty years old, it is a required read for anyone considering a profession in public administration."
1,"Horrible; got ""Stung "" by Sting",This has got to be one of the worst concert dvd's of all time. I got stung by Sting on this Police concert. The visuals are horrible home footage and the audio is almost unbearable. I was NOT impressed nor would I recommend this to any Police/Sting fan at all. Save your money and await a better dvd concert from this band/musician. 2 thumbs down. It may be noted you cannot navigate from main menu all the songs easily; you must use the FF and rewind buttons to fully cue up each song. This dvd gives a really bad impression to folks that do not know the quality of the Police and Sting have made a great name for. Bad mis-representation.
1,Very Disapointing!,"I bought this recently with the thought that I would see a wonderful Police concert. I mean, the Police have some great music and great musicians but this is not a great DVD. They spend way too much time showing audience members & some silly drunk guy playing ""Air Guitar"" , meanwhile there IS a Guitar player on stage that gets less screen than ""Air Guitar Guy"". Also, instead of showing Sting playing bass, they key in to his face most of the concert. Ok, I suppose that is interesting since Sting is a sexy dude, but what's more sexier than seeing a musician play? There are cheesy strobbing effects and ""trippy"" highlighting on audience members. The only good thing about this Dvd are the 4 extra tracks with mulit camera option. Why wasn't the concert like these tracks? I'm not a crazy Police fan, I enjoy their music, but if I were a crazy Police fan, I would be very disapointed. I recommend not buying this Dvd...Rent it from netflix first."
1,Show the Concert!,"Do not waste your time with this one! I saw this concert live back in the day and was very excited when I saw it on DVD. However, whoever the idiot was that destroyed what could have been a great show with a wave after wave of crowd shots, freeze frames, and silly cartoonish effects should be never be allowed to mix another DVD. Many reviews are correct, the show is great, sound good, and I am a huge Police fan, but take it from a huge concert fan. When the camera is on the band, which isnt often, they have head shots mostly, and rarely show anyone but sting. The effects are so silly that ""every breath"" is entirely in black and white and much of it slow motion, stings face only???Matt D Knoxville"
2,Totally 80's,"As a 25 year Police fan and recent purchaser of a flip-out, in-dash DVD player in my car, I was happy to find this concert dvd. The songs are great as one would expect but the ridiculous effects, costumes, and poor direction really distract you from enjoying the concert. There's way to much focus on Sting (wearing the most ridiculous costume of anyone)- it almost feels like watching [...]. Stick with the cd's."
5,FINALLY ON DVD!! YIPPEE!!,"GREAT concert DVD from one of the greatest bands ever. Nice transfer to DVD, great sound. Looks like the source tape was preserved well by A&M."
1,"""Oh my god I can't believe I just saw that""","There's not much special about this performance of a lot of classic songs and a few usual throw-aways. Besides that I think the producer found a bunch of ticket holders beforehand and drugged them up to film them during the show. Or maybe that's just how people were in the 80s... Anyhow, this makes for constant shots of audience members getting into the ""concert spirit"". On top of this, they added a lot of cheesy effects like 7-year-olds playing with a video editor. Sting doesn't make things any better by trying to make ""King of Pain"" into a happy sing-along with the help of back-up singers/dancers.You may feel disgusted at first but by the time you get to the girl dancing during ""Message in a Bottle"" and the cheesy effects kick in, you can't help but laugh. Did people acutally play air guitar in public during the 80s?"
4,"latter day Police era, nice but ""Police Around the World""...","""Urgh a Music War"" and I think the US Festival also featured The Police at their most hectic.In my opinion, it sounds better than it looks (although the female singers are a foreshadowing of solo Sting). I kind of wished they could have reedited it (is it me or are does the extra audio and video footage look and sound better than the concert itself?), but it's nowhere as dizzying as Cream's Farewell concert. But it's still great to see this on DVD after all these years.Sting and Police fans must have this one, but they really should push for ""Police Around The World"" even more so."
5,In a Word: The Best Playing Their Best,"From the biggest Police nut in the world, I had this back when it first came out on VIDEO! And watched it about 1000 times.If you own one live DVD, this is the one to get. Great mix, great songs, old stuff, new stuff, some killer, killer arrangements of songs old and new. Stewart is just on fire on this stage. Plus, the DVD has songs that weren't on that original video.The only drawbacks are the backup singers (unnecessary but hey at least it's not a HORN section like on Ghost tour) and a really limp version of ""Every Breath You Take,"" which Sting was probably sick of singing already at this point since it was literally everywhere in 1983.If you're looking for older police concert material to see them before Synchronicity, wait for ""Police Around the World"" to come out on DVD. Own that and this and you've got old Police/new Police covered.This absolutely rocks, though. Yes, Sting's wearing his ""rag"" outfit from the ""Synchronicity 2"" video..."
3,SEIZURE ALERT!,"I love the music and the fact that this is a real relic from the era...BUT never having had any problems with seizure activity, I really thought I was going to lose it with the strobing light/image effect. While watching all I could think was ""I hope there's a disclaimer... ."" Some of the video effects are the cheeziest I've ever seen; it just lessens the effect of the great music and overall performance."
2,"oh, hum!",There are better DVD's out there. This is not very good at all. Audio and video are poor.Skip this one.
2,you better be a hardcore fan to like this one.,"this is one of the worst concert films ive ever seen and i own lots of them. im a casual Police fan, never thought they were a top flight band, but i did like alot of thier songs. whoever directed this film needs to be slapped, constant shots of the knuckleheads in the crowd and one entire song is like looking into a strobe light for 5 minutes, you could have a seizure, seriously. the police is an average live act at best, but this could have been a decent concert film if not for the idiotic ""production values""."
3,Average,"I love this band and am upset that they chose to release the Atlanta shows on CD and now DVD from the Synchronicity Tour. The lighting effects are cheesy and the crowd shots are annoying, the show itself is very average. This band put on much better shows than this. There are 4 extra songs included here which were not on the Original VHS release which is nice but all in all a bit dissapointing."
4,Now and Forever ... and they mean that!,"Girls Will Be Girls is a hilarious and four star movie. If you ever needed another movie to build some character and give you new lines to say to your friends (and enemies) - this is it!While the beginning and middle are hilarious, it just seems to drag on forever! It holds together well throughout until the end. I have watched this movie several times and while I love it every time I normally turn it off after 3/4 of the way through. The ending is good, but not something I need to repeat often.Ending aside, this movie is certainly worth being in your collection!!!"
1,What a waste of money!,"After reading some of the other reviews on this video, I thought it would be a good laugh. After watching this video, I am sorry I wasted my money on it. True the show is a drag movie, but this plot is a drag, the story line is a drag and the ending is very much so a DRAG! 3 individuals endured the tortue of viewing this film with me. Aside from a chuckle here and there over how embarssed we were FOR the individuals in this film, most of us had fallen asleep by the end. Don't waste your money on this one, try a classic such as Prescilla, Queen of the Desert."
1,What a draggggggggg!!! No pun intended.,"This movie was a real ""stinker"".... If you are looking for some real drag action to entertain you then stick with the 2 best that come to mind........Adventures of Priscilla and Too Wong Foo. I really feel bad for the 3 who did this BOMB, they could have done alot better and maybe it would have furthered their careers. If you really want to see this film just email me and I will send you my copy!!!!!! You pay the postage though----hahahahahahah"
3,Twisted sisters,"This movie offers some of the nastyfunniest dialogue ever on film; it should win some sort of John Waters award for uncovering (and, I think, exhausting) the comedic potential of abortion. It also shows what a b***h Hollywood math can be: take 60 minutes of material, subtract 80 minutes for minimum ""feature film"" length, and what you get is a very negative last 20 minutes or so.But the first hour -- my, oh-my-my-my-my-my."
1,Pathetic...,"Maybe got through the first thirty minutes before I gave up on it. The characters, or should I say caricatures, just weren't endearing, even in the campy way they were intended. Big time loser..."
4,"An original and campy comedy, hilarious throughout!","This is an off-the-wall comedy about three Hollywood actresses, (all played by drag queens). A very original premise and very very funny! There are some great quotable lines. Whatever your opinion of men in drag, watch this movie in the spirit in which it is intended, a twisted farce and a lot of fun. Good production values belie its low budget. It shows what can be done with limited resources and a lot of creativity. This is one not to miss!"
5,Gross. Offensive. Brilliant,"The PC will have no place watching this sure to be cult classic. The rest of us degenerates: enjoy. There is a priceless, quotable zinger a minute in this gem, a midnight movie in an age where there are no midnight movies...don't miss the DVD extras--what a hoot!"
1,Warmed over Help Files,"Personally, I'm offended when an author doesn't do anything other than re-write the Help files and then sell the result as if it's original work. This book is in that category and you would be better off to keep your money and spend time with the Help files instead of looking for something in this book. The author and publisher should be ashamed for passing this book off as a complete reference when it is apparent that very little original work went into it."
3,These used to be a lot better...,"This is the fourth or fifth Gerber Shortcut that I have had. They are definitely not built as well as they used to be. I actually disassembled this one and put in the scissors from one of my old ones, that is how bad the scissors were on this one.I still have to give it three stars because of how good it used to be, maybe I got the one bad one..."
5,Bird On a Wire,"I love this movie! Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson make a good acting duet. it has funny moments and overall, thoroughly enjoyable."
4,Running frpm the law,He has used many names and trades to star away from long arm of the law. And Maryamm just happed to eun into him.
1,Didn't receive what was ordered,The movies i ordered i never received..i received two of the same movies that i never heard of..and never got a response to my e-mail from the seller..wont order again.
4,This movie should make Mel and Goldie proud,This movie was very good at adding comedy and action.Mel and Goldie were very good and had great chemistry.Despite what the critics say this movie is a delight! And the soundtrack is wonderful!
1,A SHOCKER!!!,At the time of seeing this film I was a Mel Gibson fan and a Goldie Hawn fan. But ..... words fail me.
3,Entertaining,"But the story seemed empty, the film did not work for me as a congruent work. The plotting was thin, and the screenwriting did not quite reach the brilliant performances of Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn.The sets and action sequences were spectacular but had nothing to fit around.However, the flick did entertain (maybe a notch up from slapstick) and was good entertainment, just not great."
1,More mass schlock from director John Badham,"How best to describe the target audience for John Badham films ... well, probably the Bundys (as in Married with Children). Let's just say that during TV reruns of Bird on a Wire, the commercials are for nudie bars and air fresheners.In this instalment you get to see Goldie Hawn playing her usual self: a klutzy, ditzy blonde in high heels, with the obligatory truck-stop makeup and that cavernous mouth that yaws open to yelp in surprise. Mel Gibson supplies wisecracking working class beef. The RV, Velveeta, and Readers Digest crowd should love this film, especially since the production values scream made-for-TV.If however this is not your idea of a romantic comedy, you are not alone."
4,You just gotta see this!,"I highly recommend this movie. Mel Gibson plays a guy in the witness protection program and Goldie Hawn is the girlfriend that he had to leave behind. They meet several years later, just as Mel's cover has been blown and the killers he has been hiding from have found him. This is a romantic comedy that I will watch over and over again (If only to see Mel play the hairdresser!) If that is not enough, the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful! Aaron Neville sings the title song and it is worth watching the movie for that song alone. Get this one, and you won't be sorry."
1,I really regret buying this MP3 Player!,"Avoid buying this MP3 player. This is surely without a doubt the dumbest 160$ I have ever spent. I tried to actually enjoy this, I really did but to no avail. The volume and sound quality isn't all that great to begin with. Also, the Phillips Go Gear constantly froze up on me, sometimes for days and the only solution was to let the battery die and then recharge it. But still, I tried to remain positive and just bear with it. But then one day, after a few months, my MP3 player just died for no apparent reason. It hasn't worked ever since. It's been a few months since it stopped working. Sad to say that I basically threw 160 hard-earned dollars away."
1,JUNK!!!!,"This is the second mp3 player that I've had from philips. The first one never worked and this one died after 5 months of use. When you get the ""flickering of death"" nothing in the manual works. My last philips product EVER!!!!"
2,Lasted a year and a half,"I saved my money up for this Philips mp3 player. When I got it I loved it. I got it in June 2005, it just recently stopped working in January 2007. It only worked for a year and a half. I was very disappointed with this mp3. I will never get this very mp3 again."
4,A really poor effort,"Although this mp3 is o.k, it has several major flaws, such as it's constant freezing and not playing certain tracks.I bought this with my Chrimstmas money i got from relatives ect, but, within the first month, it broke and had to be repaired for 6 months!I no they do this from time to time, but that is just ridiculus!The download software is O.k to put on your computer, but recently when i ahev used to software, it has frozen up and will not put any tracks on for me!Also, it never deletes my music library when i ask it too. It just stays there.Overall, not a very good effort from the people i would of expected to do quite well in this feild.The reason why i have given this a four star beacuase it did eventualy unfreeze, but still a poor effort."
1,Waste of time and money,"This is the crappiest mp3 player ever. Some problems encountered:-It froze within a week of purchase-Constantly freezes while playing music.-Goes dead often (refuses to switch on)-Constantly jams while downloading music, or,-a screen pops up on my computer stating that the USB port could not be detected, when it is actually connected securely.-Battery life only lasted 4-5 hours, not the 10 hours philips claims.-Constabtly jams while charging the player.I'm surprised a reputable brand like philips has gotten away with such a shoddy product. I truly regret buying this product. If you're thinking of buying this product, i would suggest you second that thought and get yourself a Creative Zen Micro instead."
3,How It Is Reminded?,"Sometimes, a song can actually bring tears all the way down, when you least expect it. That does come with the case from Nickelback. They've been known as the power ballad group that truly gained fame from the north, and showcased more to the south. Their latest single, Someday, is one that really is catchy, but can get a little bit tiring if you've heard it too often. Although the song is good for the id, it just sounds a little bit of the same old song before. Still, I really suggest you get the record, their latest album with this song. It is just one of the most decent songs out there, and sure beats the false music of manufactured artists these days."
4,No more mess,"We've been using this coffee maker now for about 6 months. It makes great coffee and gone are the days of plugged up holes on my old coffee maker that would cause it to run over on the countertop. Due to the design of this coffee maker, even if the holes were to become clogged by coffee grounds which they never have, it would only run over into its own pot, not onto the counter.Only downside is that it does not power itself off after an hour or 2 or 3. For this price I was expecting that as a safety feature if not a convenience. Therefore, 4 stars instead of 5."
3,Very basic and overpriced coffee maker,"I knew when I purchased this that it was a basic, no frills coffee maker. I purchased it based on very positive reviews. After seeing it and using it once, I realize I paid way too much for this. The carafe is very thin glass with a flimsy handle attachment, none of the parts are dishwasher safe according to the manual. The removable water reservoir, while unique, is nothing wonderful. You still have to remove it and fill it, essentially the same as filling another container and pouring water in. The brew time is very long, several minutes for 5 cups of coffee. Unless you remove the filter basket before pouring, the coffee grounds will spill over into the cup. You absolutely do have to hold down the lid to keep everything together when you pour the coffee.The actual coffee is quite good, but I do NOT feel it is worth what I paid (on sale)."
5,Basic. Uncomplicated. Perfection.,"If Muji offered an electric coffeemaker, this would be it.I have little to add to the praise included in reviews preceding this one. To the few critics, I will side with Zojirushi's engineers. Switch t on to brew coffee, then switch it off. Keeping coffee hot on a hot plate ruins the brew very quickly -- Low-power nuke a cup instead for better flavor. While brewing with any electric drip coffeemaker, place a folded paper towel between hotplate and carafe. Do this and your coffee will never taste even slightly ""scorched."""
2,Saves space,"This coffee maker fits in the space between the top of my microwave and a cabinet overhanging it.Making coffee takes some assembly skills as it's a rather bizarre setup. I suspect it's onlyslightly less effort than making coffee in a manual Chemix or Melita set-up. The advantages are that itwill fit in small places and you won't have to clean the inner workings of the coffee maker. Thatbeing said there is nothing much more to recommend it. The coffee is not very good and it does not have anauto-shutoff (Also it's difficult to see the on-light - it's practically on the back). Consequently youhave to keep this little piece of information (""got to turn off the coffee pot"") in the forefront of your head ifyou're not finishing the pot at the moment. Recommended for a one or two coffee drinker household. Makes 2 1/3 mugs."
1,Waste of Money!,"I purchased this coffeemaker November 2011. The handle on the glass pot is flimsy and feels loose. When pouring from the pot there has never been a time that it did not drip on the counter. There is no automatic off if you want to quick get a cup before it is finished. The water drips in the basket holding coffee and pouring too soon gets coffee grounds in your cup. Just after this short time the thing has completely stopped working. The water from the reservoir is not transferring into the decanter at all. The hot plate is rusted as one reviewer noted. Sixty-nine dollars!! Outrageous! I did think this would be a good, lasting coffeemaker for that price. I also stocked up on six boxes of the #2 coffee filters -- I've gone through 1 1/2 boxes only, so now that was a waste of money. Cheaply made and flawed! I would not recommend to anyone."
3,Mediocre,"I read the reviews ... wanted a compact coffee maker that would deliver. For the price of this machine, it is disappointing. It looks decent, works fine, delivers a warm, NOT HOTcup of coffee. If you want a hot cup of coffee, buy something else."
2,Not a 5 cup machine,"Be aware that this coffee maker will not make enough coffee for two 12 oz mugs of coffee. Our previous 4 cup model will easily make enough for two 12 oz mugs of coffee, so we expected that this one would too. Not so. Not even close. Be aware also that you cannot use gold mesh filters in this machine. I called the manufacturer about it and they specifically designed it so that gold mesh filters will not fit. The excuse, er... reason, given was to avoid overflow. It may make decent coffee, but these are awfully small 5 cups! I returned it to Amazon with no problem."
1,Plastic Odor & Taste,"This is a horrible coffee maker - unless you really enjoy the smell and taste of hot plastic.The culprit seems to be the filter basket. We ran many pots of water through it and also a couple of pots of coffee. Nothing helped - the smell and flavor is horrible.Seeing the many 5 star reviews, I can only speculate that the formulation of the plastic strainer basket has changed or has poor quality control.We have replaced it with a Bunn Velocity Brew. I have only good things to say about the Bunn. It had no odor straight out of the box and makes great coffee. The Zutto is being returned to Amazon."
4,Makes good coffee,"I like this coffee maker. It makes a good cup of coffee. I think it is a little expensive but not too bad.The only thing I don't like is that you must wait until the coffee is completely brewed before you can pour a cup. Otherwise, the hot water continues to run onto the hotplate."
4,No Filters sent & doesn't tell you what to buy?,"Just got this in shock, no sample filters are in here. Guess I'll got out and buy some smallones to see if they fit? Read reviews, nobody mentions what filters to buy. Will keep youposted on what I found.Ok have used this for a month now, I love it! Its perfect size, perfect amount of coffee for one.Coffee stays hot. You just use the small filters and fold the seams over. It does drip the coffeeonto the counter, but take out filter basket first, then pour carefully. Enjoy."
2,Expensive and with a critical flaw,"I actually love zojurushi products (even bought their uber fancy rice cooker), however, I can't say the same for this coffee maker. I purchased this due to all the great reviews posted. I love the small space it takes up and it's a perfect size for me. The design is flawed because of where the coffee and filter is placed. When you remove the carafe from the machine to pour coffee, some of the grounds always end up in my coffee. With traditional coffee makers, the filter/coffee piece remain in the machine, in this design, that part goes with the carafe. To compensate, I have to remove the top pieces before pouring- so not a big deal, however, a little annoying that I have to do this extra step for such an expensive machine. Also, my carafe is now cracked and it has been through normal use."
5,smart design,A great little coffee pot. Brews fast and doesn't get that burnt coffee heating pad mess because you always move the drippy filter with the pot!
5,Very nice looking; very elegant; and works very well;,"Very nice looking; very elegant, and very simple coffee maker that makes a great cup of coffee.Beautiful color; small; fits everywhere; easy to clean; Concealed, removable water reservoiris a nice feature; automatic keep-warm function also; and the filter is nice for making goodcoffee;"
4,Perfect except for one thing,"The Kojirushi coffeemaker maker makes the best cup of coffee ever! The five cups actually make two large mugs of coffee, which is just perfect as far as I'm concerned. It uses #2 filters. I like everything about it, except for one thing. One must remember to turn the coffeemaker off when you've had your last cup. I have almost forgotten several times to press the ""off"" button, since I'm used to an automatic shut off machine."
5,The perfect coffee maker for me,"I put this coffee maker on my Christmas list & it was purchased for me from Amazon. I drink a large mug of black cofee each morning. The coffee temperature is fine for me. The lack of an automatic shut off isn't a problem because I just turn off the machine, then pour my coffee. I have had no problems at all pouring the coffee & cleaning is very easy."
2,Was Jay related to someone?,"I just looked up my date of purchase on this pot: July 17. So I've been putting up with this for almost three months. What's the big deal about being able to fill the resevoir with the plastic piece? I don't find that any faster or easier than using the pot itself to fill any resevoir. Five cup capacity? Think again if you use a coffee cup, not a tea cup. I tried to buy a mesh filter. Not only not made, not made to accept one. I'm so tired of all this paper. $69.00 down the tube, if you ask me. I'd like to exchange it for a better model, assuming the company makes a good product but this coffee pot is not it."
3,too much steam not the right ammount of coffee,"This coffee maker got good reviews so we bought it.We have not been able to make a consistent ammount of coffee.The steam comes out excessivelyIf we make 3 cups, it rarely makes the 4 cup mark.Anyone else have this problem or suggestions?"
2,Disappointed....,"I had high hopes for this machine having done my usual research. But it seems like this machine has gone back in time. Nothing is connected, all seperate pieces. While the removable water well is a nice aspect and it makes decent coffee, a #2 permanent filter is ill-fitting because of the design of the filter housing. I use it anyway, just seems like a lot of pieces and futzing around to get the filter onto the plate to brew coffee. Especially for the price of this little thing!Pros:removable water tankmakes good coffeeCons:many piecespermanent filters don't quite fit the basket due to designslow brewingcoffee is not quite hot enough unless you gulp it downI will probably use it and hope the electronics are decent. If it dies, I am on the search for something else...."
5,best coffee maker we've ever owned,"With a small footprint and ideal cup brew size for our household (5 cups), there couldn't be a better coffee maker. We researched a long time, and at first though the Keurig was right for us, but after we tried one, we realized it we liked the traditional style coffee maker but one that takes up less counter space and still brews an excellent cup of coffee. Because of it's design, it's very easy to clean and never tastes like stale coffee. It seems very sturdy and I would buy this again in a heartbeat."
4,Great sturdy coffee maker,"Great coffee and a fine durable machine. The lid is somewhat tricky, and the water filters are difficult to find. Good value!"
4,"Good coffee maker, but plastic","This is a good coffee maker and I am very happy with it. I'm not sure that it makes coffee taste so good that it warrants the $70 price though. $40 of the cost probably goes to the shipping from Japan.It is VERY easy to use and clean, which is a big plus. My two concerns are that the maker is plastic and the carafe. I was deceived by the small picture that makes it look like it is metal/aluminum. I'm also a little concerned about the glass carafe. It seems a little thin. I've broken two in the last year from Mr. Coffee, so I'll have to be very careful with this. A replacement is probably very expensive as it will also need to be shipped from Japan and it is unique to the maker. I think most everyone will be pleased with this coffee maker."
4,Makes less coffee than expected,"I like the coffee maker so I won't repeat all the good things said in the other reviews. My only negative is that for a 5 cup coffee maker it actually makes less coffee than my old 4 cup Krups. The Krups didn't quite fill my thermos; I assumed the Zojirushi would, but I'm now drinking somewhat less coffee than before."
5,My husband says it's the best coffeemaker we'ver ever had.,The removeable water tank makes filling the coffeemaker easier and much neater. The charcoal filter allows the rich coffee flavor to come through. I highly recommend this product.
2,Not Impressed,"I had high hopes for this thing after reading all of the positive reviews, but unfortunately it's a letdown. It makes a good cup of coffee, but the construction is on the cheaper side and I don't think I've ever poured a cup of coffee without it dripping all over the place. I noticed that other people have commented on this problem, but I'm curious as to why it's not happening to everyone...PROS: Good size, makes a good cup of coffeeCONS: Drips when pouring, no auto-shutoff, over-priced"
2,Not For Me........,"As others have said, water does not seem to get hot enough and the overall appearance is of low quality. For a great mid-size coffee maker try the Bonavita 8 Cup Coffee Maker With Thermal Carafe - Bonavita BV1800TH available at Amazon."
5,review,excellent coffee maker. just the right size and doesn't take up too much room on the counter.i would recommend it to everyone.
2,So So,"I think I must have expected too much based on lots of 4 star + reviews, but this seems like a very ordinary machine with a couple serious flaws.I like the cone filter and the 5 cup size, but the machine has no auto shutoff (at this price!) and the carafe drips all over unless you take out the filter.Bottom line - I think for 20-25$ this would be a good buy. For 60$ I would not recommend it."
5,Outstanding small coffee pot!,I bought this coffee maker as our secondary pot for my husband who gets up earlier than me. I love the removable water tank...really easy to fill and also to keep clean. The coffee comes out tasting great and the unit looks beautiful on the counter. I have the zojirushi rice cooker so had confidence in their products. I have had many 4-5 cup coffeemakers...this one is the best by far.
5,simply great coffee,"I was looking for a 5 cup( 2 large mugs) coffee maker. It is important you know how much you will be brewing, because a 8 or 10 cup will do a sub-par performance brewing 4 cups of coffee. The Zojirushi EC DAC 50 filters the hot water, and sends it through the grounds mounted in the caraffe , so no deep cleaning of the coffee maker is ever necessary. The results are a pure, wonderful cup of coffee. I also purchased the correct size gold tone filter and pre-warm my coffee cup. I look forward to getting out of bed now."
5,Terrific coffeemaker,"After perusing various websites and search engines for a small coffee maker, I decided on the Zojirushi. Although it was far more expensive than any comparable machine, the reviews were compelling, and they were right. This machine makes really great coffee. Most machines can make good coffee if you start with good beans, but this one can make great coffee from average beans. It is well worth the extra cost over other coffeemakers. It's simple to use, and the removable parts are easily accessed and cleaned.There is one caveat with this machine, however. It is that the filter size is not disclosed anywhere in the manual or online. (It's a #2) Another small issue is that it's supposed to make 5 cups; I only get about 2 and 1/2 from a full pot--I guess my cups are larger than average.However, if clean, full coffee taste is what's important, this is the product to buy."
3,Perfect in my RV except for a lack of an auto shutoff,This drip coffeemaker is by far is the nicest looking of the ones I have owned and works flawlessly.The others were four cup coffeemakers and I really appreciate the subtle one cup increase in capacity.The lack of auto shutoff is a big concern though or I would have given it five stars.This should be mandated by whatever department oversees appliance safety.What if you have just left for a vacation never mind for the day? Just the waste of electricity should be a concern.
1,Made in China,"I just received the order of this coffee maker. When I opened up the box, the first thing I noticed is the print ""Made in China"". When I pay $65 for a basic function coffee maker like this one I expect something from Japan. I have some appliances at home from same brand they are ""Made in Japan"". Be aware!"
1,Not Impressed! Be Careful!,"To be fair, I didn't even try to make coffee in this maker, so I am not saying it makes poor quality coffee. I've only had it out of the box for about 1/2 hour, and it's going back.Some warnings before you purchase:- NO AUTO SHUT OFF. For the price that should be a basic safty function.- The ""Auto Keep-warm"" option just means the warming plate stays on till you turn it off... which they don't recommend leaving on for more than 15 mins.- The plastic lid will fall off unless you keep your thumb firmly on it when you pour.- Don't be mislead by the large coffee pot. It only fills up about half way."
3,"Makes ""good"" coffee but....","I can't understand why the caraffe is so large for a 5-cup maker. I don't understand why the cost was so much. Maybe in the long-run it will pay off but, so far, I don't see a great advantage in the quality of my coffee. If it wouldn't be for the trouble and expense of returning it, I would have done so and would get something less costly.."
3,Makes good coffee.,"This is a nice little coffee maker. I say little, because it only makes 2 cups. However, since my wife has a cup a day and I have a cup a day, it was made to order for us. The thing I don't like about it is the handle. It has a metal band that goes around the outside of the coffee maker which holds it in place. It tends to loosen up frequently, and I have had to tighten it on several occasions."
1,Not hot enough,"The coffee this unit makes is uniformly weak. I measured the water temperature above the filter and found it topped out at 176 degrees Fahrenheit, and that only at the end of the brew cycle. This is about 20 degrees lower than it should be for good coffee. Save your money."
3,Flimsy and light weight...,"After reading the good reviews about this coffee maker, I ordered it. Just today I received the coffee maker and am disappointed in how lightweight and flimsy it feels. The handle of the pot is poorly designed and looks like it would break early in the life of the coffee maker. (It does not look like the handle in the picture.) I wonder if the pot has been recently re-designed and made cheaper; because it does not measure up to the glowing reports from other reviewers. I was looking for a 5-cup coffee maker to replace my 10-cup Braun coffee maker. But my Braun is much more sturdy and substantial, and I do not trust the Zojirushi not to begin falling apart in a few weeks or months; so I am going to send it back."
4,carrafe is fragile,"awsome coffe maker but be carefull, the carraffe is easy to break putting in or out of the dishwasher and I was unable to find a replacement!"
2,Just not hot enough to brew properly,"Well, after looking at this for over a year now, I really wanted to like it. It just doesn't get hot enough to brew properly. I don't know the brew temp, but once it finishes brewing a thermometer shows 135 degrees."
2,Look elsewhere,"I have a two other Zojirushi products, the hot water dispenser and the rice maker. They are both brilliant products that work well and are well made.While made to a high standard the Zutto coffee maker is a borderline product. The hot plate that is built into the Zutto keeps the coffee too hot, quickly (minutes) causing it to 'cook' and go bad after brewing.I recommend you look for another machine that uses a thermal carafe if you want drinkable coffee after the first cup."
4,found a gold filter that works!,i just received my new coffee maker and can't wait for my first cup of joe in the morning. It looks great in my newly renovated kitchen! I wanted to inform other owners that I purchased the 4 cup Cuisinart gold filter and it fits beautifully....no paper filters needed.
2,Nice but overpriced,"This coffee maker is twice the price of an equivalent Black and Deckor or Mr. Coffee model. While the look and build quality is certainly better, I'm not sure it's twice better. And the coffee tastes only a little bit better out of this machine.However, the reliability seems better on this one than lower priced models, and I like the Japanese engineering. It's still too expensive for what it is though."
5,Love it!,"This makes the best coffee ever. It is easy to use, coffee is hot and delicious, pot is easy to clean. It never drips and the cover does not fall off if you hold it with your thumb. There is no comparison to other makers whose coffee is awful. It is worth the price."
4,coffee tastes good,This coffee maker is the right size for one person--or two if you don't drink a huge mug like I do. I like that the water container comes out to be filled rather than having to pour it into the back of the coffee maker like I have before. The only thing I don't like is that it didn't come with a permanent filter like other coffee makers usually do. I ordered one #2 cone filter but it isn't a perfect fit. It works as long as I don't put the top cover on the carafe.
5,great small coffee maker,"always felt like a full size coffee maker was unnecessary waste of spacethis does the trick wellbe careful about the steam vent on the top, it is not particularly conspicuous and gets dangerously hot (as with other coffee makers)."
4,good little coffee maker,"This is a good little coffee maker. Especially like the tapered basket. Also like the removable water tank. Easy to clean all the parts. Cons are the somewhat pricey cost and no bells and whistles, such as a timed shutoff. But still a good coffee maker that does a good job"
4,looks aren't everything,"I bought this little plain jane coffee maker based on the reviews, and the fact that it has a cone shaped filter.It futher has a removeable water tank, which few, if any, have anymore. The removeable tank prevents those little accidents from ""dinging"" the carafe on the metal faucet..It makes hot delicious coffee, it is a no brainer to operate,it is not inexpensive, compared to many other of comparable size, but it is worth the price for the flavor of coffe it produces. It has a charcoal filter which probably helps. Having said all that, it does not have an automatic shut off. For those of us who leave the house for the day, and usually in a rush, this requires some adjustment, at least it did for me."
4,Beware of Flawed Design,"I purchased this coffeemaker based upon others' comments. This coffeemaker is very easy to use, simply designed, and easy to clean. If you like drip coffee, it makes a very decent tasting cup. The reasons I gave it 4 stars is beacuse I think that the price is too high. Also, pouring the hot coffee can be tricky. If you remove the filter basket, the coffee spills on the counter when it is poured. This happens even with the lid still on the pot. If you leave the filter basket in the pot, you must remember to hold the lid while you are pouring because the manufacturer says that injury could occur. Why charge someone so much money for a flawed lid/basket design that could cause injury?"
2,Very disappointed,"When I received this product, I was very excited. Thinking I had found the perfect 5 cup maker. My excitment turned to dissappointment very fast. Coffee was good but when emptying the grounds the paper filter was stuck to the side of the basket with syrupy coffee that had apparently boiled over into the basket. Fearful that if it got this hot it could be a fire hazard, I promptly returned it to amazon and ordered a kitchenaid 14 cup."
1,NOT HOT ENOUGH !! 165 DEGREES? HORRIBLE !!!,"I just brewed my first pot and I am extremely dissapointed. I will check the actual water tempurature in the basket next. I seems like it is well under 190 degrees, possibly even below 180. The coffee is not good!I should have noticed the water has a long way to go befor it gets to the grounds and will cool off too much for proper extraction of the coffee.I'll try another few times and probably contact Amazon to try to return it.At this point I would NOT RECOMEND BUYING THIS.I just wanted a small automatic drip brewer that was better than the MR Coffee. The Jojurushi is not even close.... and MR Coffee is not great.I am afraid that if one wants high quiality coffee in a 4 cup / two mug size range you have to hand brew with Melita.OK I TESTED THIS THING OUT AND IT RAN UP TO 165 DEGREES f. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO GET TO SOMETHING CLOSE TO 200. IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DO NOT BUT THIS COFFEE MAKER IF YOU LIKE GOOD COFFEE."
1,Didn't like it,We didn't like this coffee maker because it doesn't turn off on its own. You have to turn it off yourself. I recommend the Bunn instead.
1,rustysnowhite,This was not bought has a toy. It was for our Daughter that is getting marryed. This way they can start their new lives out with a gift from my husband and I. Maybe some day in the furture they can have fun with them.
2,MIssing crucial (at least to me) data,"Its an OK listing of pictures released during the 60's, and you should be happy with it. However, the listing of production companies (movies produced by seperate entities, and released by studios) are hit or miss. Sometimes there -- sometimes not. You might know THAT was the information I was looking for!"
3,Tynans crossover falls flat,Possessor of a wonderful tenor voice tynan trys on this album to be something for everyone but hes not! Who advises this great star on what to sing? Some of the songs are as well done as we have come to expect but some are obviously not his style!!
3,Good but far from great,This cd is only good it could have been alot better.Ronan has a nice voice but he get's a bit nasely on many of the song's.Some of the songs are kind of boring.
5,Destiny,"My best music purchase in years!From the opening Man of La Mancha powerhouse, through familiar andunfamiliar lyric beauties, Ronan both sings and heeds the line, ""Mydestiny calls, and I go!"" And if he creates more albums like this, andwrites more songs like the deep, magnificent ""Passing through,"" Ronan'sdestiny is certain: to become, if he is not already, the ""beloved Irishtenor"" of our age.Before this album, I didn't bother with Ronan's solo albums. Now, Iwill fight to get his next!"
4,Ronan: A Review,"Having been lucky enough to get a copy of this Cd at a concert just days prior to its release my friend and I actually listened to it on the way home. Ronan: The CD has done it again - once again delivering Ronan's voice using a variety of uplifting and emotional songs. In crossing over from the traditional Irish songs Ronan is known for you can almost imagine his outstretched hands and he hits the notes as only he can. My personal favorite-on this CD-Man of La Mancha. His dedication and tribute to his parents is apparant in ""Passing Through"" and ""The Old Man."" Ronan is a gifted man with a talent for finding success. This album is no different."
5,SPECTACULAR,"I highly recommend this album. It's sheer perfection--a real gem. His soaring voice is pure gold, and this album shows his versatility. He just gets better and better. It'll send chills down your spine. It's hard to choose my favorite song, because they're all beautiful. This CD comes with a colorful insert with the words to all of the songs, plus several photographs."
4,Great duos!,"This CD presents duos of the pop star Philipp Kirkorov with such Russian celebrities like Alsou, Jasmin, Alla Pugacheva, Masha Rasputina, Nikolai Baskov, Kristina Orbakaite, and the group Balagan Unlimited.One of the singing partners of Philipp is Lou Bega who became once wildly popular with his hit Mambo # 5. The two sing two songs together on this CD.The recording is very entertaining and full of life. I would recommend this CD not only to fans of P. Kirkorov but anyone who is interested in Russian pop-music."
3,Attractive music,"Kevin Kendle's music is special. I became aware of him when I heard a composition by the name of ""Sunflowers"" on a satellite music channel; I had not heard anything like it. ""Sunflowers"" is included on Kendle's 2001 album, Flowers. This album--Butterflies--was released in 2003. It is comprised of seven pieces. I find every one of them to be pleasing. Not only am I interested in music that pleases me, but I am also attracted to music that is distinctive and that I can feel a personal connection to. Kendle's music fits that bill. Words to describe this album are atmospheric, natural, serene, lush, relaxing, therapeutic, floating, and melodious. Pure is another word that I can use to characterize this piece of work--a word that I also use to describe classical music. Also, there is mimimal percussion work. This CD is just over 55 minutes. Actually, I rate this piece of work 3.5 stars. Butterflies is recommendable."
5,The 1980s BEST female vocal group.,"The Jones Girls were most definitely the 1980s' best female vocal group as evidenced by such tracks as ""Get As Much Love As You Can"", ""Nights Over Egypt"", ""Love Don't Ever Say Goodbye"", ""Ah Ah, Ah Ah"", ""Keep It Coming"" and ""You Can't Have My Love"". Had they been better promoted and had circumstances been different during the first half of the 1980s, The Jones Girls just might have become the Supremes of the 1980s."
1,Not an authorized dealer!,"I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my wife in December. 7 months later the faceplate fell off. Disappointed that I had spent that much money on a watch to only have it break after 7 months. Regardless, I mailed it in to be repaired and fully expecting it would be covered by warranty. Only to be called by Amazon stating it will not be covered and they will send me an estimate on repair after I have paid to have it shipped across the country. I explained in detail what the problem was before I sent it so not only am I upset that I paid to have it shipped, wasted my time but then I find out they are not going to cover it because they are NOT an authorized dealer of Tag. I called Tag and they told me Amazon was not an authorized dealer. When I brought this up to Amazon, their response - ""we never told you we were an authorized dealer"". Be careful buying from Amazon."
4,Big Boy Pete - 'The Margetson Demos' (Gear Fab Records) 4 1/2 stars,"Some old school psych fans or enthusiasts may not necessarily get quite as much out of this twenty-three track - Big Boy Pete compilation CD as I did. Mostly for the fact that these songs - are in reality demos, with a few that sort of sounds a bit rough. Some of the tunes here that I thoroughly enjoyed the most were ""Baby, Get Some Of That"", ""My Love Is Like A Spaceship"" (with it's awesome psychedelic guitar work), the (definitely) Beatles-influenced ""Little Men"", ""Funny World"", the humorous ""Henry Nut, Pt. 3"" and ""Boogaloo"". Also liked the catchy ""Character Actors"", the mod-sounding ""For Those Of Thee"" and the [true] undiscovered gem ""Who In The Heck Do You Think You Are?"". Highly recommended for fans of early Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett, Tomorrow, Status Quo, The Nice and possibly Idle Race."
2,Disappointed,I was hoping for something along the lines of a documentary with reinactments of actual events as in the original legend. I've since learned the story behind the the making of this one.
4,Wish I knew how it ended,"Very much enjoyed reading this book (both when I was first exposed to it in college and now again on my kindle)... the world is rich and well painted. My only criticism is that it ends too soon for me (in a way similar to The Chrysalids by John Wyndham) and I would rather KNOW what happens. The ending is still interesting, and does tie up some questions in a unique way... but I wanted more. :( I suppose that in itself can be a sign of a good book.Overall, it was a fast and interesting read that I would recommend to any fan of dystopian literature."
4,good read,"Altho the story line is a bit disjointed, the book provided an interesting look into prewar Palestine. A time and place I was not famililar with."
2,"Plodding Plot, Unrealized Characters","I was shocked at what meager fare was offered in this prize-winning book. It's an easy read. It's too easy a read. The author left the flesh from her characters, who are skeletal. She also didn't put the mystery in history. I love this time period in Palestine/ Israel, was anticipating a work more engaging, more poetic, revelatory or insightful. But the author plays it close to the bone (or to the skeleton herein). She doesn't spread her fictive wings. The narrative is far more pedestrian than heavenly. I don't recommended this book and am most sorry to say so."
2,Dull,I bought this book on the off chance that it might be a good read but I found it very dull. Very flat and monotone and I am surprised by its good reviews. The title is interesting.
5,Enjoyed Movie,Old British movies are great. Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter) Was a teen when she did this movie. Good ending.
2,Not what I expected,"A Hazard of Hearts is based on a Barbara Cartand novel, which I didn't know. This DVD is made from a poor quality video and it shows. The story is o.k., the acting is not that great."
3,A Hazard of Hearts,The scenery and costumes were fantastic but some of the acting could have been a little better. Had great actors.
2,Disappointed,I choose this because I love great period pieces especially British but.this particular movie hazards of The heart was ok but I didn't enjoy The Lady Hamilton movie especially seeing Vivien Leigh in That Hamilton Woman for me nothing else compares to it.
2,Disappointed,"I like Helena Bonham-Carter and she was fine in the Hazard film, but the script was trite, the story _really_ predictable and Diana Rigg played it too over the top. I expected more after reading all the good reviews.The Lady Hamilton film was terrible! Raunchy and embarrassing. I cannot recommend buying this DVD. I would definitely not let young people see the second film! A horrifying amoral heroine."
3,",Hazards of the heart","I was very disappointed with this DVD set, I did not realize it was 2 movies before I ordered it, the second was pretty raunchy. I love Amazon & will always trust what I buy from them & have bought many things from them & always very satisfied."
3,A Hazard of Hearts/Lady Hamilton,"I was disappointed That I had not noticed it had no CC. With the British accents, it was a little difficult to understand."
4,Double feature,"This movie reminds me of one of those historical romance novels. The cast is great and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Diana Rigg is the villian and she does a superb job of it. Helena Bonham Carter is always a joy to watch and she's quite young in this one, Hazards of the Hearts. The second movie wasn't as good. The story of Horatio Nelson and Mrs. Hamilton is a good one, but I didn't feel this version was very convincing."
4,Excellent value,Two movies for $3.98 - great value. If you liked the Ghost of Monte Carlo you'll love this one.
1,trash,"trash in every sense of the word - junk, ugly and for sure NOT recommended especially if you have children...whereas as adults, once you begin watch the send movie, within the first minute you realize its content and short of nausea you simply throw the whole disc in the trash....do not waste your money on this item"
3,"Hearts Good, Bad Acting Lady Hamilton!!!!!","I bought this DVD for ""A Hazard of Hearts"". It was exactly what I expected! Although, the added raunchy film, ""Lady Hamilton"" was not worth the time they spent taping it!! It was awful!!!"
3,Two stars or three?,A Hazard of Hearts is a bit of a bodice ripper. Lady Hamilton doesn't make the grade as a B-movie.
1,The movie is too old to enjoy,"This movie is outdated, old, and boring. If you like helena Bonham Carter, it is interesting to see her in her early days, but otherwise, the quality of this movie is so old - ugh!"
3,Hazard of Hearts/Lady Hamilton,"These stories need to be watched a second time to understand the best parts. They both seem a bit off, but after the second viewing, I am glad I purchased this set. The only bad is it looks like old film, and are a bit blurry."
2,Not so hot,I generally enjoy all of Helena Bonham-Carter's films but this one was not up to the standards I set for her work. She was okay but the film was only mediocre--very disappointed.
4,Hazard Of Hearts,I did enjoy this movie can't believe it was filmed in 1987 and after all this time finally got to see it I liked the actors they did a really good job.The only thing I didnt like about it were the scenes jumped from one to another to fast I think anyone who sees this movie will like it.
3,A Hazard of Hearts/Landy Hamilton,"A hazard of Hearts was ok, I think the acting was poor and plot line did not hold my interest.Landy Hamilton was not in my taste. Certainly not for anyone young to watch, poorly acted out and I did not realize their would be Adult subject to such an extent. Would not recommend this one."
1,the quality of the films is terrible,"You can hardly see Lady Hamilton with so many blurrs and freeze parts, very poor quality it is a pity!"
3,I love this movie...however,"the quality for copy that I received was not what I expected. It was not clear and it appeared as if it were copied from a copy...almost like a ""bootleg"" effect. I realize it's an old film and it was not very expensive. But I did pay for it and wanted a good copy. Be careful!!"
5,Hazard of Hearts,"This is a regency romance, a simple tale which is done well and with a good background. A good film for a rainy afternoon."
3,"One is a winner, the other...","Hazard of Hearts is a decent storyline and good acting and plot. It is the second movie ""Lady Hamilton"" that draw the rating down -- way way down if it were to be evaluated by itself. Imagine 1960's Italian dubbed filming, fuzzy-edged picture. The lead female character is supposed to be irresistible to everyone--with her fake hair and really thick eyeliner--even to the female monarch. The other characters -- well, I was reminded of ""Hercules"" with Steve Reeves from whatever timeframe that was. If you pay $5 for the package, just ignore the second film and enjoy the first. Romance in the Barbara Carland style."
5,WOW,I saw this movie when I was in my teens. I read the book first and I never read any romance novels. I was above that My mother insisted that I should read it. I liked it and when I heard it was going to be on television. I watched it with my mother and had to admit that I liked it. So of course I was looking for this on VHS and could never find it. So when I found out that Amazon had the DVD for sale I of course I had to purchase it.It didn't make a romance novel fan nor did I ever read anything by Barbara Cartland either. But this book and movie I will make an exception.However Lady Hamilton was too old to watch and in bad quality.
1,Totally Tacky,"I was expecting Merchant Ivory and got Hustler! Except for the usual classy performance of Bonham Carter who makes the best of a bad role in ""Hazard of Hearts"", both films are tacky and ""sexploitive"". ""Lady Hamilton"" is pretty much soft porn, even badly filmed. Can't decide whether to toss this thing in the trash or donate it to Goodwill. A thorough disappointment and a waste of time and money (unless, of course, you like that sort of thing!)."
4,I love A Hazard of Heart,This is a great movie. The Performance is excellent. Actor Marcus Gilbert is really handsome. I am wondering why he did not become a big star?
4,Half good; half useless,"I enjoyed A Hazard of Hearts and was especially pleased because of the low cost! It is definitely worth what I paid. However, in my opinion, Lady Hamilton is trash, but I don't need to watch it and I can ""pretend"" it isn't even there."
3,Pretty Lame,The film is older and somewhat grainy. Great acting but it's a romance novelist's rendition of life...really? Helena Bonham in her early acting career....okay. The wicked eminent mother-in-law is by far the best actor and her jewels are fabulous! This film doesn't come close to to Downton Abbey as far as characters and scenery and believability.
3,Martine McCutcheon didn't sing?,That's too bad because she is a little songbird. It might have been a better sndtrk with her on it. 3 stars from me!
4,Great mix of music,"Great, mellow CD. I enjoyed the movie, and this CD really takes me back to the different scenes. It's a feel-good mix of music with a good range of artists."
3,NOT THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK SORRY TO SAY,"THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK I'M SORRY TO SAY & SAD TO REPORT.You will be disappointed if you buy this thinking the song arrangements are the same as they are presented in the movie. WHICH IS GREAT BY THE WAY.Jump & All you need is Love & Christmas is all around (although close is not the same).By far the best song on the CD is sung by Olivia Olson, and is better than mariah carey, and nearly as good as the DVD version."
4,"Good but incomplete, actually","Some soundtrack CDs come with a mix of songs and original score music. This, unfortunately, isn't one of them, which is a shame as some hauntingly beautiful score music plays during several scenes. I also share the views of other reviewers re missing songs by those who actually appeared in the film."
3,Achtung! Tatsachlich...Liebe,"I tried to review this earlier but it kept saying ""try again later""?? That's too bad because the earlier version of the review (now lost) was a ""masterpiece""!There were a few problems with this order although some of them may not have been the seller's fault. 1-The jewel case was cracked. 2-It was a German release: the title and liner notes were all in German. 3-In a couple of cases the artist OR the version of the song was different than the one in the movie (i.e. Girls Aloud instead of The Pointer Sisters and a more polished but less appealing version of All I Want For Christmas by Olivia Olson than the one heard in the movie).I did not pay a lot for this CD so I'm not that upset about these discrepancies. I do think, however, that the product I received was not precisely the product I ordered."
4,love actually,"Enjoy the music from bluesy sound to jazzy fun songs. We enjoyed the movie, so we wanted the CD because of the music."
3,The best version available,"I LOOOOOVE the movie ""Love Actually,"" ESPECIALLY Craig Anderson's score, and this is the only album version that includes any of the orchestral tracks. That being said, I think it is far from perfect. The tracks aren't in chronological order with when they are played in the film (which I know is common with film soundtracks, but it still annoys me). ""All You Need Is Love"" and ""Jump (For My Love)"" are not the same versions as in the film, AYNIL is a more subdued and in my opinion kind of boring cover, and Jump is a cover. There are also some tracks that I don't recognize from the film at all and just plain don't like (my least favorite being Wyclef Jean's ""Take Me As I Am""). And the whole reason that I bought this version (for the orchestral score pieces) was a letdown--there are only 3 of these tracks, and none of them are that long. It's an okay album and definitely the best version available, but it still leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion."
3,Watered Down,"I just made the purchase of this album and have to say that I'm quite disappointed. The MAIN reason I purchased this album was to hear two of the bonus tracks: the Billy Mack and Olivia Olson ones. Truthfully, I am happier listening to the movie version. Both are watered down studio versions.The Billy Mack track is missing the Motown backup singers until the very end. The backup singers are what gave the song its sarcastic sentimentality and the song is nothing without them.Furthermore, the prodigious Olivia Olson is greatly insulted by her being overpowered by the instrumentals of the song along with her voice being thinned by artificial echo.The rest of the CD is great, but if you really loved these two song as you originally heard them, then I would suggest just purchasing the DVD when it comes out and rewatching the scenes."
2,Why can't they get it right??,"These songs are great, but why oh why, is Bill Nighy's hilarious ""Love is All Around"", NOT on the album???"
2,Wanting...,"How could anyone produce a sound track of ""Love Actually"" and not include Olivia Olson's ""All I want for Christmas"" is beyond me."
2,Where are the horns?,"I'm so disappointed two songs on the soundtrack. The version of ""All you need is love"" is missing the horns, strings, and guitar that made the recessional scene in the movie so special. Without the instruments it's just a bad cover of a Beatles song. The second disappointment is ""Christmas is all around""--in the movie it was sung with personality and verve--again missing from the soundtrack. I feel cheated and to quote from Kevin Smith, ""I want my $17.99 back!"""
2,All the songs are on my CD--but still disappointed,"Not sure about the complaints below about PM's Love Theme missing--my import soundtrack has it. (There seem to be at least three differnt love actually souncrtacks, so it might be possible to buy one that doesn't have the tracks you want!). Mine matches the track listing shown above for this item. However, Jump is not the Pointer Sister's version that was in the movie (it is some rather hollow faux disco number), the Billy Mack cut is not well-mixed nor is All You Need is Love, where the instrumental additions in the chruch scene seem to have been cut out, giving a monotonous and repetitive chorus that goes on and on. I LOVE the film and have watched it far too many times, but the soundtrack doesn't meet my expectations. Were I you, I'd save my money."
5,the rest of the playlist . . . .,15. White Christmas - Otis Redding16. Christmas Is All Around - Billy Mack17. All I Want For Christmas Is You - Olivia Olson
1,More disappointment,"""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" as it says on both the front and back sides of the CD? Give me a break!As another reviewer wrote on Jan 10, it is disappointing not to get a movie soundtrack when you pay for a movie soundtrack. I bought the CD to listen to Olivia Olson's (Joanna Anderson's) ""All I want for Christmas is You.""Of course, the track is not the same one as I heard when I saw the movie. In the movie she sings her intro without background music. On the audio CD, there is unwanted background music clutter from the start and, to my ear, it only gets worse as the piece progresses.When will the recording industry set standards voluntarily, clearly spelling out on labels and advertising any soundtrack substitutions? Or, do they prefer to wait for more government regulation?J Records, a unit of BMG, shouldn't expect any more business from me anytime soon."
5,Love actually is all around you!,"If you haven't had the chance to see this delightful, heart-felt Christmas comedy, you've missed a milestone in romantic story-telling! This is a wonderful (albeit British) romance, set in a yuletide atmosphere. As more Americans actually see this film, it will eventually become a modern-day Christmas tradition. Enjoy! Love actually is all around you! js P.S. The above review relates to the film. The soundtrack sets you reminiscing about the romantic scenes in the film!"
2,Disappointing,I should have heeded the advice of your other reviewers. This CD didn't seem to represent the soundtrack at all. The music in the movie was much better. Very disappointing
3,Love Actually CD from Movie,"CD is fine, but some of the music that was in the movie does not exist on the CD.... Too bad,,,,"
4,Best sound track,If you even just liked the movie you will love the sound track. There were a couple of songs that I didn't even remember from the movie but it was awesome.
4,If you liked the show,I like the album but there were a few songs that I could not figure out where they were in the movie. But i like to sing with the ones i know and can skip the songs that i don't really care for.
5,Great!,Great mix of music -- glad I got the UK edition so the beautiful instrumental themes were included. Reminds me of the movie which makes me happy.
4,If you LOVED the movie,"I am partial to English romantic comedies with Hugh Grant in them. Needless to say, I thought Love Actually was the best movie ever and saw it three times in theaters. Cannot wait till the DVD comes out...The soundtrack is equally good with an excellent mix of oldies and goodies from the movie. I especially like the re-do of Mariah's ""All I Want for Christmas"" and the inclusion of some of the best Maroon 5 songs from their CD ""Songs About Jane.""If you want a good mix CD, pick this one up and I don't think you will be disappointed."
5,EXCELLENT,I LIKE THE ALBUM VERY MUCH L HAVE THE ALBUM IS EXCELLENT AND L THINK GIRLS ALOUD SONG JUMP IS BRILLIANT THAT SONG SHOULD WENT TO NUMBER 1
4,"Good, but incomplete","This is a very good soundtrack for anybody who liked the movie to have, and my only beef with it is that it's incomplete compared to the british version of the soundtrack. I compared the N. American sountrack to the one listed on amazon.co.uk, and it's missing 5 tracks. Our version includes Christmas is All Around and All I Want For Christmas as bonus tracks which is great as the cd would be incomplete without them. However, the british version has a different version of the song Jump for My Love, and includes tracks completely left off our cd by Otis Redding and Gabrielle, not to mention the 3 different love themes by the movie's composer, Craig Armstrong."
3,From track 8 to great!,"The first part of the CD is mostly meaningless pop, and I have to be honest, I detest Dido, so seeing her name for me is not an endorsement, but from the Pointer Sisters' ""Jump"" on, the CD is flawless.I was disgusted to see amazon.com DOESN'T have the Billy Mack and Olivia Olson songs listed- I'dve preordered the album if that had been listed, but rest assured, the movie's most important track is indeed on the soundtrack.Joni Mitchell is a revelation.This is the feel good album of Christmas. See the movie too!"
3,music review,I did receive this cd in a timely manner but was disappointed in the quality of the cd. It appeared to have been copied due to the fact that there was no listing of the titles of the songs.
3,Missing Songs,"Thanks to the other poster who warned about the difference between UK and US versions of the CD. I ordered mine from Amazon.co.uk to get the songs I didn't see listed in the US version.I don't understand why there are multiple versions of a soundtrack to begin with. If the song was in the movie, put it on the soundtrack. Why is this a difficult concept??"
5,"Great songs on 'Love Actually"" Soundtrack!!",I just added this to my Christmas playlist!! Great covers of new and old Xmas songs....and so relevant to the movie plotline. This was a great buy!!
4,Only Edition to Buy,Has all the songs from the movie including the theme music and Joanna singing all I want for Christmas at the Christmas School Play.
4,"Good, but.....","This Soundtrack is very good, but... if there were more of the movie music score, that would've been 5 stars. As the score from the movie was fantastic. Anyone know if such a CD would be coming out?"
5,positive,The product is the one I ordered. The CD is new and it includes a booklet talking about the different singers. Took a long time to deliver but I am contented with this product.
2,"whatever, it works","its not music i listen to- it was a gift for someone else. it works though, so i i'd buy it again if i had to!"
4,Good compilation.,Very nice compilation. It has a great mix of christmas as well as non-christmas music. The Joni Mitchell song steals the best song slot for me.
5,Just saw the movie again..,"Just saw the movie again (on a long plane ride)It is one of my favorites. Then I remembered that I had purchased the soundtrack twice--4 or 5 yrs ago--(the first one was ""borrowed"") and I went looking thru the mess in my car for the other one. Found it today and drove the long way to work listening to it.I love this version of Songbird, and hearingJoni Mitchell sing Both Sides Now. Many good songs."
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"This is hands down my favorite movie soundtrack! Seriously, I cannot gush enough about this CD. There is not one song on this CD that I don't love. It's even hard for me to pick favorites. ""God Only Knows,"" ""All You Need is Love,"" ""Too Lost in You,"" ""I'll See it Through,"" ""Take Me as I Am,"" ""Both Sides Now,"" ""Turn Me On,"" ""Jump (For My Love),"" and ""Songbird"" rank up there with my very favorites. (I'm sorry-- I know I listed practically every song!) ""Christmas is All Around"" was the main reason I bought the CD and it was worth it just for that song! All the Christmas songs are wonderful. I bought the CD around Christmastime, but I've found myself listening to it all the time. You won't be disappointed if you buy this CD!"
1,What a disappointment,"It says on the front cover of the CD: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. I bought it mainly for the version of All you need is love, this one has nothing to do with the one of the movie soundtrack!!!!!!Regret having spent money for this. Shame on the producers."
4,Slightly disappointed,"I loved this movie....watch it often. I love the soundtrack which is why I ordered it. First disappointment: ""Jump"" by the Pointer Sisters was in the movie, but by a different artist on the CD. Also, CHristmas is All Around (remake of an old song) was song by Bill Nighy, not Billy Mack (a fictitious person, a character in the movie)....but that's the way it was listed. Is it a quality control issue? Where was the Pointer Sisters rendition of ""Jump?"""
4,"Amazon,,,omitted,,,where made, again,,,with 3 different (usa,indonesia, british) versions !?!?!","I was afraid of poor qual. on the indonesian version, but it was good,,,now that i read about a larger/more tracks Brit. version, i want that one,,,WHY IS AMAZON SO TIGHT ABOUT NOT TELLING US HOW MANY VERSIONS THERE ARE TO PERCHASE AND WHERE THEY ARE MADE ? just standard corp stupidstuff i guess,,,"
3,informative!,Initially loved the book for the beautiful illustrations which made my mouth water. Some recipes require a few trials & errors to get the most authentic result but it's a good start!
4,Tea Lunch,"I bought this book to go with the Joyce Chen bamboo steamer. The book has many interesting recipes. I haven't tried any yet, but will as soon as we do an appropriate lunch"
4,Quite good for its size,"This is a far better book than I had expected--possibly because my previous purchase in this field was Vicki Lilley's exceptionally amateurish and inauthentic effort. Although not comprehensive (see Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's Dim Sum book, especially the 1982 edition, which is far more encyclopedic, as is Mai Leong's), what recipes ARE included are very authentic indeed and extremely precise--which is certainly as it should be, given such a dainty culinary art form. In addition to the books noted above, I must say that my favourite dim sum books are the ones by Wei-Chuan Publishing of Taiwan, but their occasionally fractured English and odd measurements (""1/4 cup plus 1 T. plus 1 tsp.,"" etc.) would not make them everybody's first choice. Blonder's book is both sophisticated enough to be of interest to the dim sum initiate, but detailed and painstaking enough for the beginner."
3,The must have char-siu bau recipe inside,I was looking for a few recipes especially for char-siu bau or roast pork buns that were baked. When i read most of the recipes elsewhere i could tell they were not right until i saw the one in this cookbook. My judgment was right as the net result on my first attempt was mouthwatering good. They came out better than most restaurant offerings too. The only difference in my attempt was that i used smoked pork marinated in a chinese bbq sauce instead of roast pork and used my bread machine for the dough instead of the old fashioned yeast with water at a specific temperature. I did not care for the pork and shrimp shu mai as they lacked flavor but the buns were fantastic. Looking forward to trying more.
3,This book amy be better than the three stars I have given it.,"I have not finished reading this book yet, So, far I am quite happy with the contents and the organization of the book. Agent Orange has left me with several physical deficits. Maybe this is a path to some healing or at least some relief from discomfort."
5,Best of the Best,"This is absolutely the most original, humane and magnificent piece of work to come out of the so called punk movement. D.C. is known for raising up some incredibly talented and enlightened musicians - but whoa - can anyone say 1+1=743! The synergy of these four musicians - if it's raw intensity could appeal to a popular audience would surely garner the respect of the most critical music afficiandos anywhere! If you want cererbral - it's here, if you want melodic - it's here, if you want honest adn emotional - it's here."
4,Mad Caddies,"this is a fantastic album however not quite as good as duck and cover although it does feature some bloody good songs on it, but it if u like it."
5,Awesome,"I am a really huge Mad Caddies fan, and while this CD doesn't have the same mixture of ska and various other forms of music found on Duck and Cover or Quality Soft Core, after a couple of listens it has pretty much become my favorite of their CD's."
3,Ok...,"This is probably Mad Caddies worst CD. It's not terrible though, but not amazing, mediocre. There are some really horrible songs on here like 'Weird beard' and 'American badass'. They are trying too hard to do the pirate thing. The best songs on here are 'Mary melody' and 'We'll start to worry when the cynics start believing'. 'Easy cheese' is good too, even though it sounds straight outta some teen movie. Get this only if you already have all their other releases."
2,Horrible!!,I only bought this because i wanted to hear Derick Plourde on drums. this is the last cd he recorded on. He only plays on maybe 5 songs. His stuff with Lagwagon is the best!!
5,Easy reference,"Very handy with great photos. Perfect for identifying potential problems before they get out of hand. It also helps to diagnose the problem so you don't waste your time and money on the wrong treatment as I've done in the past. Now that I have this reference, it's easy to see exactly what the problem is and treat it effectively."
4,review of manual of Koi health,The book was well thought out as far as content. The author spoke to the reader taking into account that the reader might be a novice koi keeper
3,Not Comprehensive Enough,The information is decent but there's a lot that isn't covered and the index isn't sufficient to help you find the small section that might cover what you're trying to figure out. It's adequate for a beginner's book but Dr. Erik Johnson's and Dr. Sainte-Erne's books are considerably more informative
5,what?,"Les Bonnes Femmes or ""The Good Girls"" is a surprising film. If it doesn't leave you emotionally perplexed then you should get a job at a hospital telling families that ""there loved ones are in a better place now."""
5,Les Bonnes Femmes,"Brimming with the breezy energy of Parisian nightlife, Chabrol's long-neglected New Wave masterwork maps the dreamy desires and frustrated aspirations of four young women bored by their mundane job in a deathly quiet appliance store. Homing in on the tawdry emptiness of '60s urban swingers, the hypocrisies of respectable society, and the loutish womanizing of male sexual predators, Chabrol satirizes the times while lavishing tremendous sympathy on his female characters. Shot on location in the hip, fast-moving City of Lights, ""Les Bonnes Femmes"" is a perfect marriage of splendid acting and intriguing turns of events."
4,shooting gloves,these gloves will keep your hand warm. but i do not recommend these for shooting not unless it is freezing because these will get your hands very sweaty.
5,Warm and efficient!,Use it as tight as you can in your hands. Very warm almost without lost of abilities. The size is perfect!
5,great gloves,"I got these for a christmas present and they are pretty nice. They are very warm and fit well. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a warm, sleek, and high quality shooting glove for a great price."
4,Very Nice,"Received these as a gift, haven't worn them much yet so this is a ""first impressions"" review.Size XXL is still a little too tight, but I expect there will be some ""breaking in"". Even tight, they're quite comfortable.Neither my iPhone or my (job provided) Blackberry touchscreen respond to them.It doesn't get really cold in StLouis, and so far not cold enough to wear them for an extended period of time - They're too warm!Grip is excellent, even on wet objects.All in all, wonderful."
4,"Very good, not exactly what I thought they were","These gloves are not as warm as I thought they would be, but they provide the best tactile sense I've ever gotten from a glove. Tight fit and compact, they work well in shooting, but do not have extra padding if you are considering them for use with a .454 Casull."
2,"Hatch ""All-Weather"" Glove","These gloves are not at all warm and make your hands sweat, futher amplifying any cold weather you may experience. If the lowest temperature you are likely to experience is 45 degrees then these gloves might work."
4,"Comfortable, but not even slightly weatherproof","I bought these gloves with the intention of wearing them to outdoor clay shooting in the winter. I quickly found out that they're better than nothing at all, but they're definitely not warm. I used them once in the rain and they were quickly soaked through.All of that said, if it's not too cold out, they're nice - very comfortable and grippy."
4,Ran kinda small for me,"Great gloves. They ran a little small for me, which wouldn't be a problem since they are obviously supposed to wear tight, but the seams are right along the fingertips so they end up being somewhat uncomfortable. And the neoprene does make my hands sweat."
4,Fits like a...glove.,"I purchased these gloves on a Monday night and received them on Thursday afternoon. I measured my hand to be a medium but the seller didn't offer that size. So I went with a small. They ended up fitting snug but workable. They are thicker than latex...but not by much. I'm in Search & Rescue so I need to be able to grab gear by touch in the dark. These work fine. The only thing I don't like is the leather folded over inside the finger tips irritates me. They left quite a bit of extra when they cut it. Thats the only thing I dislike. They are thin, so I don't expect too much longevity..."
4,Awesome gloves!,"I have small hands,(7"" from wrist to tip of middle finger)ring finger size is 8.5 My leather GI utility gloves are a size 2!It's crazy hard to find a good fitting glove. I usually have to purchase a medium and deal with fingers that are too long.These things fit perfect! Even the damn pinky finger is the right length.The synthetic leather palm material is grippy but not heavy. The neoprene back keeps hands warm in at least 30 degrees (so far).I can type and text in these things without serious errors, and as for shooting-Perfect feel and grip! No knuckle protection is the only thing holding these back from a perfect score!These would also make excellent driving or scuba diving gloves, and the price is so good I plan to buy more to keep as spares!"
5,works,"works what can i say pros they work cons there made over seas, would of been better if made in the u.s.a."
2,Eh.,Glove is not suitable for winter therefore the (all-weather) glove should not be noted in this glove's description. My hands were freezing when it was cold outside even with this gloves on.
5,AWESOME.,Amazing Product. Feels incredible and keeps your hands warm. You can even use your iPhone without taking them off. Thumbs Up!!
5,Great product!,Bought these for my husband who is a police officer he has gone threw so many pairs of gloves and these ones have held up the longest out of all of his gloves. He has to grip a pistol and sohot with gloves on and these are perfect.
3,Hands cold in Sub 32 weather,These are not the hardcore winter gloves but I thought they would be a little warmer then what they were. They fit great and feel ok because they are a little thick so it takes a little bit to get used to on the trigger pull. If you have a small trigger guard you might have issues with these gloves.
5,All Weather Shooting/Duty Glove,"I was kind of hesitant on these as I didnt really find any good reviews that gave me enough info about them until I went to a mil/law forum and got the info I was looking for. They are ""all-weather"" and just by wearing these for a while I will agree with the fact (it is winter in Michigan after all) because they were pretty warm but with how warm they are, I dont feel they will be practical enough in the warmer months. Again, its winter here in michigan, so time will tell how they are come spring/summer.Aside from that, they fit well (I got size L) and do well when I am shooting and/or using my hunting knife."
4,Good Gloves,Bought these for use with my M4 and LR308. Excellent glove for shooting. No issues operating weopons. Did not buy to use with handguns but works great with 1911 and sig 9mm as well. Great dry or wet but NOT for cold weather...at least not in pacific NW.
4,Where are the mediums?,I see you have every size but mediums. I hope you get some in stock soon so I can order a pair. The large is just slightly too long by a few MM's. Its enough to get slightly stuck in my trigger guard.
3,Does not handle cold weather very weal.,I bought these to go to Romania from which I just returned. I tried them out in very cold and snowy weather and they failed to keep my hands warm. I would not recommend them.Gary
3,Far from nice leather gloves.,"Was looking for driving gloves or winter gloves, short at the wrist. The neoprene back is soft, warm. Really didn't like the rubbery palm-finger grip. It gave a weird sensation to my hands. Was hoping for a leathery, soft feel. I like the feel of 5.11's taclite gloves a lot better.I think it's got a sheepskin palm(I thought this ""Hatch"" product would be a cheaper alternative).If you're looking for great grip on a firearm, a jar lid, etc... This is a good pair of gloves."
2,Too thick..Couldn't feel the bullets when loading my magazine,"I purchased this item with the hopes that I would no longer have fingers that are covered in lead/gun powder residue, and oil. Unfortunately, the gloves were too thick so I couldn't even feel the bullets when loading my 9mm or my .22 mags."
5,Great Gloves,"I couldn't be happier with these gloves. I've been nitpicking around shooting gloves for years, never having found a pair I was more satisfied with than your average mechanics gloves. These gloves are all that I hoped for, they fit nice and snug, yet still provide good feel and range of motion. Mine get light use, so I'm not sure on their durability, but I wouldn't expect them to last long under heavy use with the neoprene backs. They are definitely great gloves though and worth the cost, where they can be easily replaced."
3,okay product,"These gloves were okay. haven't used them yet, just tried them on for fit and feel. I don't have the confidence in them holding up to duty at all. My feeling is, I won't get much use out of them.Would not recommend to friend."
2,Disappointing,I bought these as a Christmas gift for my step mom and they turned out to be no better than a cheap wal-mart pair. We live in Mississippi and it still did not keep her hands warm. I would not recommend these if your planning to use them in cold climates.
5,gloves,After I read a few reviews from others I decided to give these gloves a try. Thanks... to thoughs who gave these gloves positive reviews. Beause I'm pleased with these Hatch all weather gloves. The shipping was fast & packaged well. When I put them on they fit perfectly on my hands and fingers. I also reached for my Glock on the end table and the grip was...outstanding! Also a great buy!
3,TOO THICK AND STIFF FOR GOOD TRIGGER DEXTERITY,I found these to be too thick for trigger dexterity for tacticle purposes. I like to use a qood quality driving glove.
2,Not what I've expected.....,"I was looking for light weather gloves and when I saw neoprene on the gloves, it was clear that I've made a mistake...."
3,Shooting Gloves,My finger tips do not reach the finger tips of the gloves. I would say they are a size 5 1/2 and My hands are a size 5
5,Best Gloves,"These are probably the best shooting gloves I've ever owned. Durable and fit well, used them probably 300 times and barely any wear."
4,OK for what you pay.,"This is my feedback on ""Hatch Specialist All-Weather Shooting/Duty Glove, Large, Black"" gloves that I received today from Amazon. It fits nice and snug and does not feel awkward to handle a shotgun in the open range. It does feel slightly uncomfortable (warm) in the indoor range, probably because the neoprene fabric does not breathe; and it is not very convenient to load a handgun magazine. However, I prefer to use cotton gloves in the indoor range, so thats not an issue for me. Overall I think it is good value for maoney."
5,Hatch Gloves,"Love 'em. They have held up well over a year, and have performed well. I would buy them again in a heartbeat. No rips or tears even though they've seen some heavy use."
5,XL Size - Good Fit,"XL fits very well, it is about 9 inches from the tip of my thumb to the tip of my little finger.Warm, rugged, and flexible; good pair of gloves."
4,Great for shooting,"These gloves look great, fit great and while wearing them you can load mags.Chamber round just about do anything you need to during target shooting. The only thing I was not happy about is they are not as warm as advertised . But a great buy for the price."
4,not very all weather,"had been looking for a pair of shooting gloves for duty use but as it turns out the description for ""all weather"" doesn't exactly cover ""cold"" weather which was even more dissapointing when learned they're from Safariland, they are comfortable however and even cool nights not bad"
5,Great Gloves,"Cannot say enough good things about these gloves. They are lightweight and flexible with neoprene on the back and synthetic leather on the palms and between the fingers. The synthetic leather is very durable and paper thin, you can actually use an iphone or your computers touchpad with them on. The index finger and thumb do not have any extra grip but the other three fingers and palm do. I mostly use these when riding my motorcycle. the gloves keep my hands warm and really cut down on the wind. Alot of the reviews say to buy a size smaller, so that the glove will be like a second skin. I have an eight inch hand length and am glad that I went with a size large. Anything smaller and I feel the cuff might start to ride up on my palm."
5,A Must Have!!!,These gloves are awesome. They feel and look very professional. No problems with using them. Will be curious to see how they hold up over time and how warm they keep my hands in the colder months.
3,Tight fitting,Would buy one size up next time. I like the gloves but they seemed to be off in sizing. I normally wear large and thats what size I bought in these but they are very snug and not so comfortable for long periods of time.
5,Great Gloves,These are great gloves. I bought them for my brother and we went shooting. It was cold and he said they were great and that he could still feel the trigger well.Great wind breakers.
4,"Tactical describes these gloves-they are like having insulated, waterproof fingers",We bought these for our son-in-law who is in the Oregon guard-he wore them on a weekend maneuver in the snow and very chilly air. He said he could do nearly anything he needed; the length of the fingers was perfect and the gloves gave him very good gripping capability.
5,Great gloves,"Not the best for walking around in the cold weather, but when you play broomball like I do or stay active, then it keeps your hands warm. The palm surface gives you the control you need. The only complaint I have is that the fingers are a little big but i might just have small hands."
3,Neoprene gloves,"The quality of the gloves is fine. However, I found that the manufacturer is making the ""small"" size longer in the finger lenghts compared to previous pairs that I have purchased locally. It's probably best to be able to try on prior to purchasing."
2,uhm,"not exactly what expected, would be great for driving and minimal outdoor use but for hunting in the cold, gets wet easy and not very warm"
1,Amateurish,"Why I keep wasting my money on Quicken, I will never know. I had the Home & Business before and didn't like it then. I hoped it would be better this time even though the reviews here were not very good on it.Quicken should be called Home Plus, not Home & Business. It may be great for personal bookkeeping, but it doens't cut it for a business. It appears to be written for people who know nothing about accounting and don't want to learn anything about accounting.It you want a good accounting tool for your business, try something else."
3,Coolest Sex Scene--Mediocre Plot,"Most the reviews are pretty on target. The script is not the best for the talent that is in this movie, but they made it work. However, the sex scene between Rachel Hunter and Eric Roberts accompanied by excellent background music makes it the coolest looking I've seen on film so far."
2,do you speak english?,"movie is well made, however, they left out english sub-titles. The sub-titles are in Spanish only. What a bummer!"
2,The Professor's Mystery,"The settings did not seem to be true to the time period of this writing. It's time and distances did not seem real. I kept hoping that it would get better, but it did not."
3,Review of The Professor's Mystery,I am in the process of reading this book. I'm finding the use of several words that I don't know the meaning of.
2,improper fitting lids,I received these in today. The smallest container has a lid that wont snap on. It is stress marked on the opening edge of the lid is very lose and falls off. The larger container has a lid that is very hard to snap on. The lids are both a different color from the other. I will never buy this brand again!!
2,disappointed,"I'm sure this is a good product, but, I had to give it 2 stars because it was in pieces when I opened the box. I couldn't even take it out."
1,It exploded while cooking Thanksgiving dinner!!!,"This is the first negative product review I have had to write on Amazon.I was about to prepare lasagna in the large dish. Maybe there was heat rising from the oven. All I know is that I walked out of the kitchen for a moment, only to hear a loud crash. When I went back into the kitchen, there was glass EVERYWHERE! The dish had exploded leaving both large pieces and small shards of glass throughout the entire kitchen. Thankfully, I was not in the kitchen when it happened (thanks to going out to answer my phone!), and the other Thanksgiving meals were covered.I don't know exactly how this happened, but I won't be using this brand of ovenware anymore."
3,I've had these for years....,"Please note: I didn't purchase my set from Amazon but ours broke too. It just sort of 'exploded'? Not sure why but the glass was in huge pieces and very ez to clean up. I had it for many years along with another dish and I use them every week to bake so perhaps the age of the dish could be a problem? I know for sure there were no chips or cracks b/c I check every time I go to use them & have even taught my son and husband to do the same. So, I'm not sure why this happened but it scared me and though I haven't thrown away the other bake ware I do now keep an eye and ear out to make sure there are no loud noises coming from the kitchen. We had two 9x13; down to one now and still have 2 of the square ones with lids; and 2 of the round ones (1 with glass lid the other with the blue plastic lid). No problems with any of those yet....purchased around the same time (about 8 years ago, I guess)."
3,"functional, but may require modification","The bottle opener works fine, but I found that the cylinder valve I had was larger than the clamp would accept. So, I had to put it on a lathe and open it up a little so that it would fit. If you don't have access to that kind of tooling I would be wary of spending 300$ on this thing."
1,Worthless product,"This product was sold to me by my local pet supply store. I started treating my snake when only a few mites were visible, using the direction on the label. Within a few weeks, my mite infection became out of control. My poor snake was covered with mites, despite this product."
1,software is nice for a beginner,"I have evaluated several products and this one is probably the easiest and the least detailed. I had to wipe my butt with the manual, but since it was so easy to use I didnt need to refer back to the manual."
5,A Clear Look at the Future of War,"Martin van Creveld obviously completed this book before August 1990 ( 1961) because there is no reference to the Gulf War. And yet his discussion of the new kind of war that will dominate the 21st Century anticipates everything that happened in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan. He may not name Osama bin Ladin, but he clearly describes him. This book is eerily prescient. For once the book jacket blurb is absolutely on the mark: ""For professional soldiers, to neglect this book is to neglect our duty."""
3,Start with the ending,"Mr. Van Creveld did some good work here. This volume gives a good background on the history of war and warfare. The problem is that he spent too much time on the historical perspective. Most of the treatise should have focused on the prologue i.e. how and why war will be transformed. Now, these comments may be unfair because the book was written before September 11th (i.e. the early 90s) Bottom Line: Mr. Van Creveld needs to immediately start on the next book because he has hard data to back up his assertions."
3,Oversimplification by Omission,"I'm giving this book three stars because it at least will challenge the reader intellectually. The book makes a number of predictions based on what was appearing to be a start of a trend back in 1990. Most of these predictions have already turned out to be quite overblown. The book is reminiscent of the doomsday flicks of the late 60s and early 70s, particularly Soylent Green. If you watch that movie with Heston, you'll not need to read this book."
3,Not that great,"read this book with very high expectations based on the reviews. There is a lot in it. Some of it is right, some is not (e.g. the workings of the Roman Army are oversimplified). My major gripe is that it equates the modern state to a war making organization: when classic armies disappear, the state disappears too. The modern state probably was born as the most effective warmaking organization of his time but others could argue that it was born as the most efficient task collecting organization of his time. In any case today it does a lot more than putting armies in the field and collecting taxes. Plus it has infinite resources compared to a small group of, say, terrorists. A state that is well led and aware of the dangers of low-intensity conflicts can survive byadopting the same techniques and exporting the conflict as much as possible. Unfortunately, on one thing van Creveld may be right, that this will force the state to adopt terrorists' techniques."
1,musicman,Wouldn't recommend this album mainly because every song has a longgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg drawn out solo. I love dispatch but I'm not a fan of this live album.
3,Decent,"I waited in eager anticipation for this CD, after hearing numerous Dispatch tunes, and truly loving songs such as The General, Elias, Two Coins, et al. I had even downloaded some different live versions.After hearing the CD many times, I have decided that it has been somewhat of a disappointment. Being a huge DMB fan, I quickly noticed the rather unimaginative and basic instrumental solos. Attempts at harmony were often off in this CD, often having the harmony part overshadowing the main tune.I would only recommend this to people who have already seen dispatch in concert, for something to compare it to first. Listen to their recorded material first, and don't expect too much. As I said, it's a decent CD, it's got all the songs, but just comes up empty."
2,I love live music,"I love live music, given the choice between the live album or the studio version I will always take the live. Having said that this album is really bad, I will stick with Dispatch's other albums. Most of these songs are just [half-hearted], they hardly put any work into Elias or Bang, it is really sorry. The only reason they get the stars they do is because I really do love this band. Hopefully the boys will put out a better live CD sometime soon. I have better Dispatch live mixes that I have downloaded online... oh wait there's an idea. Save your money."
2,You Know You're in Trouble When the Best Actors are Dogs!,"I wanted to like this movie. I expected to like this movie. But I was disappointed by Call of the Wild.What Left Me Cold?The film never drew me in. Most of the actors were clearly acting (and not too well at that) rather than becoming part of a compelling story. Character development was so thin that I never cared much what happened.While the scenery and photography were stunning, the editing was poor, and the black screen breaks between scenes distracting. Makeup was obvious, such that I saw makeup rather than seeing the ravages of cold.The relationship between boy and dog was never fully developed. It was there, but emotionless, almost sterile.Overall, I found the movie flat. I enjoyed the scenery but missed the pull of the original story.Five stars for photography, one star for editing, one star for story. Average: Two stars."
2,Complete series ??,It seems to be for small children with bad writing and poor acting and then end mid sentence. Small children might not notice.
5,Good Price,"I bought this DVD series as a gift, so I can't speak to the content, but the recipient was very pleased with this gift and the price was great."
3,Not Jack London's Version,"Despite having his name over the title, this is not Jack London's Call of the Wild. This is a completely original story about a young man named Miles Challenger--not a character in the original book. The script incorporates characters and incidents from the book, but the story is totally different. However, taken on its own merits, the film is entertaining. Miles is a character young people can relate to, and the film does offer an interesting look at life up north during the Alaska gold rush. Just don't expect Jack London's story, or you will be disappointed."
4,Great old fashion entertainment.,"In today's world, I can understand why this series was canceled after 12 episodes in 2000. However, those of us who long for the simple dramas of the past, can find it refreshing to watch this series."
1,They really ruined a good story!,"In case the other two reviews don't convince you, this has almost nothing to do with Jack London's story. I was thinking as I watched it, ""At least they took out the violence so young children can watch it"" but then there's the scene with the frozen stiff man, and the drowning in the frozen water scene was pretty bad for little ones, too. Not to mention all the dogs dying left and right.Don't waste your time."
5,Call of the Wild,"Just purchased a copy of this DVD but mine has just 8 episodes. It was an outstanding story. You really get involved with the main characters including BUCK the dog,he is awesome.Agree with all the reviews. Really would love to pick up more episodes."
5,Great Set To Collect,"My family is in the process of collecting the Bleach series. You can't really review just one box set when there are only 3 discs and it doesn't complete a chapter in the saga. The whole series is really great and we watch it together as a family. There are some things that might not be appropriate for younger kids, depending on your personal views. Overall, I think it's a wonderful story that encourages perseverance, determination to succeed, and loyalty. This whole series was a great find for us."
5,bleach,"i bought this and got it in on christmas day i was amased with the product and once in a while you get bored but this box set was exacly what i was hoping for... is a great buy, enjoy."
3,Won't be buying the next box set after this.,"I have had enough. As much as I love the series, VIZ's money grubbing has to come to an end. I just cannot afford to continue to pay the same price for half the content any longer. Enough is enough.Thanks VIZ for driving away another fan."
1,so once Again,"I love bleach and i've stopped adding bleach boxsets TO MY Anime collection and you know what it's a drag i'm an Anime collector,i've been collecting Anime for almost 2 yearss now and i can say i have a pretty good collection. So cause they are no longer producing full season box sets (i tolerated it with season 4) but now , i must say they are really discouraging and outrageous . TO ALL ANIME FANS HOLD OUT FOR THE SEASON SETS IT'S NOT WORTH IT AND WELL TOO DARN EXSPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
4,"Cool little record, but no soda pop","""Inzombia"" admittedly has some of Slant 6's best tracks (of their disappointingly small two album discography), but it also has their worst. Some of these tracks really rock and showcase that flair only Slant 6 seems to capture, a retro-style girl punk that has attitude without coming off as cheezy or pretentious. Unfortunately, tracks like ""Retro Duck"" and the album's much too long title track are songs to skip--and this coming from someone who believes skipping tracks is ordinarily a punishable offence in music listening. I'm not telling you not to buy it; it's good, but it lacks the consistently mind-blowing song-writing that ""Soda Pop-Rip Off"" has, as well as uniformity as a whole."
4,_Taking Tea_ takes us back in time,"Michael Smith's book is packed with recipes for teatime goodies, reason alone to purchase the book; but for fans of nostalgia, another compelling reason to read this book is the highly evocative introduction, in which Smith lovingly and meticulously describes his Yorkshire upbringing: the household organization, habits, and, above all, teatimes!"
4,"Build quality not great, but it does what it says it does.","Not hard to assemble, all necessary parts included. It's basically made of thin aluminum tubing and makes you wonder if it'll just collapse with the first shot. Not so. This has been supporting a full-sized crossbow target for half a year fully exposed to the elements without a hitch."
5,excellent book,"This is a great book. There are plenty of illustrations to copy or practice with. She mentions celebrities that have had mehndi, and provides pictures of them. The recipes are good. We use the ""quickie"" recipe, and my tattoos come out rich and dark. Give it a try if you want to add to your design collection. (My book has a different cover.)"
5,"Excellent. AAA, The best to hit the shelves yet!!!","Excellent. A must own for every Mehndi Artist, beginner or Professional. I have been in the Beauty business for the past 18 years and my third year doing Mehndi. This is the book that I have been waiting for. It contains everything from recipes to traditions throughout the ages, even giving you lists of wholesellers in your area. If this does not explain it~Then you should just give it up! But with this guide, you will be in absolute Mehndi Heaven-PEACE. James D. Lamberth Jr. San Diego, CAJLamberthj@aol.com"
4,Great pictures,I loved all the pictures in this book. I got some good ideas for designs but I could have done without the bindi section.
1,"Self-absorbed, shallow pap","I read this book from a clinician's point of view, and I must say that this individual is not as 'recovered' or as healthy as she has led herself to believe. The diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, much like ADD or ADHD in children, is over-diagnosed and over-medicated, yet little-understood or discussed. This delusional woman is extremely self-congratulatory over the supposed success of this book. I wonder how many of her supposed maladies would vanish if she merely changed her diet or listened to people who would speak the truth, and not only pay attention to those who always tell her what she wants to hear. People who claim to suffer from BPD are merely adult children who never liked hearing the word 'no', and will still throw tantrums to get their own way. Lack of self-reflection and poor impulse control cause knee-jerk reactions and violent, paranoid assumptions."
3,Interesting read...,I had to buy this textbook for my sociology class. I never really care for textbooks for school but in this case it was very interesting. It wasn't like some of the other textbooks that are very dry reading. It's easy to follow and keep up with the chapters and the material that is being given. I thought with the structure and syllabus of my class it fit very well. And although I wouldn't probably read it again it isn't something that I wouldn't recommend anyone else getting if they wanted to.
3,Haunting me,You should buy this book because it is full of mind bending and spine chilling stories. All the kids in this book have had real contact with ghosts. Maybe you will too. My favorite story in this book is The Baby-Sitting Ghost.This story is about a girl who is baby sitting a baby. She starts to fall asleep when a old lady wakes her up and tells her to go to the baby's room. She finds the baby choking and the lady tells her what to do. When the girl saves the baby's life the lady is gone. When the old lady is gone she sees that she pulled a locket out of the baby's mouth. She looks inside and there is a picture of the old lady.When the parents come home the girl ask who the lady is. They say it was the Grandmother of the baby and that she is died!If you liked scary stories like ths one you will love all the other stories in this book!
4,great halloween stories for tweens,"My niece, age 10, loved these cds. The story tellers voice was just right. The length of each tale was perfect as well as the content. Great for her October sleepovers as they go to bed listening to it and giggling."
4,Excellent product,I bought this and the color cartridges as well.Correspondence was great.They work perfectly in my MP780 Canon all-in-one printer/scanner/copier/fax.I recommend this seller and their product.
2,A disapointment to me.....,I got this toy for my birthday not too long ago and I tried using the keys to open the lock on the diary. Sadly the Key broke and I could not get the diary open. My father had to ripe the lock part out of the diary and I now had an unsecure diary again! (sigh) I really reccomend not getting this toy Unless you are buying it unlocked! ovber all almost all of it is really pretty.Georgina
1,do not waste your money,very cheap quality and leaked on the first use. Where the plastic and metal meet leaked the first time it I tried to use it. It's not from the screw up cap but below it. Do your self a favor and spend a few more dollars to get a better quality thermos/ travel mug
3,Copco 16oz.,"This product is durable, and definitely dishwasher safe, but it could be more attractive and keep beverages warmer longer. I found that there was a lot of air escaping, which meant that my tea did not stay warm as long as in my other thermal travel mugs."
2,Doesn't keep the beverage warm for long,"So I filled the mug with hot water for 5 minutes before using... still my coffee didn't stay hot for longer than 4O minutes. Second time around I kept sliding the mouthpiece shut after every sip to keep the heat in (a real inconvenience) but even with this, the coffee didn't stay hot for longer than 50 mins. Just not the thing for me. I'm a writer and I like to stay put for hours. Too bad. I really wanted a mug with a handle. Now I'll just have to get that OXO mug that everyone raves about."
1,Don't buy this cup,"The top is badly threaded so that it's impossible to line up the drink opening at a right angle to the handle on either side, let alone both as advertised. The good news is that when I complained to Copco, they immediately offered to replace my cups with a different model, so they get four stars (minus one for not doing it right in the first place!)."
4,Makes me wish I was in Hawaii,"Great album... kinda different than the normal Jack Johnson ""I'm going to explain whats wrong with the world"" of his other two cd's. The 1st song on the Cd actually made me smile, something his other songs don't usually enduce. I couldn't say its better or worse than his other CD's but if you like the other 2 and you dig his hawaiian/folk/reggae style... then I'd bet the 12 bucks you pay for it that you'll smile too, just like I did, when you put it on for the first time and wish you were in Hawaii."
4,Pretty Good but.....,"First off I must say I really like jack johnson! I first heard of him when his songs were featured on the soundtrack to ""Out Cold"". The music here is nothing spectacular. It's just simple guitar work with simple lyrics and a great voice thrown into the mix. This is great chill/summer driving music but not much more.If you are in the mood for some simple easy listening music than this is the perfect cd for you!Album Highlights for me:Banana PancakesSitting, Waiting, WishingStaple it togetherCrying Shame"
1,I can't believe people listen to music like this?,"It isn't that it is the most disgusting music I have ever heard, but there is just no edge to this music or anything that makes it stand out from music that anyone could make. No outstanding musicianship, no great melodies, structure or lyrics. This CD pretty much defines boring. There is much better music out there for anyone willing to take the time to look for it."
1,So Awful,This type of music makes me wanna kill myself. So boring and not fun to listen to at all. I rather listen to Fran Drescher for 8 hours then to have to listen to Jack Johnson singing Banana Pancakes. Worst music I have ever heard in my life. Don't bother buying the CD unless you are going to commit suicide very soon.
1,Would make a fine coaster.,This has got to be one of the worst cds ever made. My dog could do better. So could my cat.
1,Jack Johnson has one talent,making consistent albums that sound like an anthropomorphic summer took a poop in a box and this is the recording of it.
1,lousy service,"The CD did not work e-mailed her told Her I was returning item no response have returned item and e-mailed repeatedly for response, replacement, etc no word from her . will call credit card company and dsipute charges for her and will probably not do business with AMazon either if these are the types of people you work with"
2,If you liked On and On and Brushfire Fairytales,"Then this CD is not for you. No guitar playing that make Jack popular except for the ONE song Sitting Waiting Wishing.If you like reggae this CD is definitely for you. Every song has a 'boom boom cha' boot, I wouldn't even call this Jack.Sounds almost exactly like Ziggy Marley combined with G love and Special Sauce.VERY disappointed with this CD. I don't understand why bands change their style from what made them popularHORRIBLE CD. Like I said, if you like the sound of Brushfire Fairytales and ON and On this CD is NOT FOR YOU, it sounds NOTHING like his two previous CDs.WHAT A WASTE OF $15!"
4,Chillin' CD,"First off, I'd like to say this is not Jack Johnson's best CD. That being said though, it is a really great CD.It's simplistic tunes are bloody great for chilling out. It's a little softer than previous albums: If you need to cool down from a hard day, nothing is better.Other's have said all the songs are to alike, however I would not like it any different.He has some great songs like Bannana Pancakes, Better Together and Sitting, Waiting, Wishing.I'd have to say if you're buying your first JJ track, go for On and On. You really have to like this kind of music to like this CD."
4,jack johnson will always win...,"i found this CD to be absolutley charming, as i did on and on and brushfire fairytales. while jack is becoming mainstream music and ""sitting, waiting, wishing"" is now quite a popular music video, true fans know that his previous two albums, particularly brushfire fairytales, were better than this one. Jack Johnson is still always my favorite to blast, and banana pancakes, good people, and better together are among the best. while i'm not sure yet if in between dreams will grow on me, jack johnson continues to be one of the best musicians out there right now, and will always pump out first-class music.happy listening-sarah, 15"
2,hmmm....is that it?,"this album left me feeling like i'd gotten a condensed version of a cd. maybe this is just jack's style, but the songs were super simple and didn't really entertain me. don't buy this album unless you have a mellow tiki bar in hawaii and need a soundtrack to play. otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,There is better mellow folk music out there old and new,"I have listen to these guys songs they are listenable nice and kind of dull for one thing the dude's voice is nothing to wave about. So i'm going to name a some music old and new that you should check out in addition to or instead of. Starting with the old Nick Drake, Joni Mitichel, Gordon Lightfoot, Tom Waites, Lou Reed there is more but i would be here all day naming them. The newer ones would be The magentic fields, sondre lerche, belle and sebastain, The Divine Comedy, Grandaddy, Stephan Malkmus lead singer of pavement who is solo now. Not all of this music sounds actlly like Jack but it is more mellow music and singer songwriter stuff you should check out."
4,In Between Dreams,"I found this music a little slow at times, but it has thoughtful lyrics and would make good background music or just for relaxation."
3,Nice music but all songs are about the same,"Bought this cd for the hit song 'sitting, waiting...' but all songs are about same style, and besides this the hitsong became too popular in Dutch radio (could hear it almost every hour) sojust one Jack Johnson cd is OK for me"
5,"Keep Dreaming, oh yes, do.","I think I'll keep it brief here, as I feel a bit short for words for once in my life.I hesitated to join the Jack Johnson train, mainly because I tend to stay where I am with my music, feeling very content with my favorites.And maybe because I knew this guy was quite popular with my young niece and nephew. Auntie can't relate to much of the tween music out there...But, I decided after hearing a few of his songs to CAVE in. I bought this CD along with another one, Sleep Thru This.I just have one question for all you JJ fans.Is there a single bad song??????I'm hooked, I'm awed, and I'm now a believer in the importance of branching out, venturing out and opening my heart to new music.This is simply good stuff. mmm yeah."
4,"Grab a glass of wine, kick back, and listen to this disc",This disc is a solid collection of mellow songs. If you've had a long day and need to relax and not crowd your mind this is the disc to listen to.
5,MY FAVORITE CD,"This CD is happy, uplifting and fabulous. It is my most favorite CD in my collection. I have been listening to Jack Johnson since 2002 and this is by far his best. It always makes me so happy ~"
3,alright...,"I feel this is my least favorite of my jack johnson cd collection. It lacks the feel, and energy that brushfire fairytales and on and on had. Its still pretty good though. PEACE & LOVE"
5,"""Musical Artistry At It's Best""","I just picked up this CD this week after ""On And On"". Another gem of a CD. Jack Johnson plays music the way it should be. Pureamazing talent. My favorite tracks are "" Staple It Together"", ""Crying Shame"", ""Good People"", ""Sitting, Waiting,Wishing"". I prefer Johnson's more uptempo songs. The melody, rhythm,and lyrics just stay in your head. Like ""On And On"", I keep playing these CD's over and over and over. Jack Johnson issuch an extraordinary talent-the perfect blend of every element that results in works of musical art. Jack's music is mesmerizing.Not only is it refreshing, but it appeals to a wide audience. I am personally grateful to artists like Jack who skillfully remind us what""real"" music is."
5,In Between Songs and loving it!!!,"Jack Johnson is an amazing musician. And that is a rare comodity these days..just think.. a musician! He is just a guy and his guitar singing about life and love. His mellow, island music is a instant good mood. This is one of his best cds...ofcourse every cd has something to offer. I see a lot of growth in Jack's style, lyrics, and melodies. There are some real catchy songs on this album. One of my personal favorites is ""Never Know!"" The best thing about this album is that I can't even give every song the time it deserves because I can't stop listening to the first few...they are soooo good! Jack is amazing...go and buy a great cd and experience good music."
4,In Between Dreams by Jack Johnson,"Every word of Johnson's mouth is like the hands of the world's most skilled massuse on the back of your shoulders. His music is so soothing and relaxing, the perfect collection for a lazy day around the house, driving in your car and guaranteed to be this summer's essentional soundtrack. From start to finish the album is near flawless, with the only track I have a problem warming up to is ""Staple it Together"". ""Sitting, Waiting, Wishing"" is a fantastic first single, much better than ""The Horizon has been Defeated"" (a great song in its own right), from 2003's On & On. My personal favorite hear is ""Banana Pancakes"", and following closely are ""Crying Shame"", ""Do You Remember"" & ""Constellations"". Even the interludes, ""Belle"" & ""Situations"" are better than what most artists have put out in recent memory. Jack is hands down of the best musicians on the planet today."
5,"Smooth, mellow, and fantastic as ever","Jack Johnson justs seems to keep getting better and better as he puts out music. on each album he grows from the last one and it definitely shows on this album. This has already become one of my favorite new albums of 2005 and the year is still new. If you are into mellow, relaxing guitars and vocals, then Jack Johnson's ""In Between Dreams"" is most definitly for you. I can't wait for him to begin touring, and I hear that he has ALO, (That's Animal Liberation Orchestra for those who don't know), opening for him. This CD is well worth it so check it out and love it!"
4,not too shabby,"It's still Jack but doesn't quite have the same feel as 'Brushfire Fairytales' or 'On and On'.Although there are some different sounds coming out of this one, there's no need for worries, Jack's still making beautiful music. I don't think you'll be disappointed.The album jacket is attractive and really nicely put together.I hope you enjoy."
5,More Great Stuff from Jack!!!,Another great Jack Album... Great stuff. Can't wait for the summer tour and the next album...
2,Music For People Who Aren't Into Music..,"I was at a party recently, and the hostess put this CD on. I caught bits and pieces of it in between conversations and picked it up a few days later. Now, I see why this CD was chosen for party music: it's perfectly suited for background noise. In Between Dreams is so innocuous, uninteresting, lightweight and breezy that it should become a standard in dental office waiting rooms everywhere.If you want to hear some perfectly crafted pop, check out The Pernice Brothers' ""Discover a Lovelier You."""
5,Incredible talent and variety,"This CD is the best I've heard from Jack Johnson. Even though Jack's talent on guitar and vocals is clear in everything he does, this CD offers a variety of tunes unmatched by anything else he has done. Definitely his #1 offering"
4,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:great rhythm, optimistic, fun sound, strong songs, great guitar workbad side:nothing too bad about it!standout tracks:do you remember; sitting,waiting,wishing; crying shame; breakdown"
2,I'll Pass,"I gave the record two stars because the guitar playing is decent. Other than that this thing doesn't have much going for it. The songs all sound similar and no effort was put into creating decent lyrics. If Soma were music, there's a good chance it would sound very similar to this album."
2,So-so,"If you like Dobie Gray from the 70's then you'll like this CD. The song structures and playing are fine, but this type of music is a bit too boring for me."
3,Skips,This is the third time I have purchased this CD. The third song on each disc always skips and will stop playing!!!!Im a little frustrated!!
1,Jimmy Buffet Regurgitated,"I'm forced to listen to this at work and actually feel physical pain. It's often described as mellow (maybe in a drug-induced comma), but all I can think of is banal, trite, insipid, an American Idol early reject maybe. Anthems for beer-belching yahoos? Most of the surfers I know listen to punk. Anyway, expand your consciousness if possible and pick up Richard Thompson, Edwynn Collins and Nick Drake for starters, money better spent."
1,bland and boring,"This is some of the blandest and most boring music I've heard. There's no uniquiness, originality or creativity to this music. This music has no energy and Jack sounds partly asleep when he sings, and it's enough to put the listener to sleep. I don't understand how anyone can enjoy ""chill"", laid-back boring music like this when they could listen to GREAT bands like Mr. Bungle, Nuclear Rabbit, Idiot Flesh, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Fantomas or Secret Chiefs 3."
2,Boring and repetitive,"This guy gets two stars since he is one step above a street performer. His music is a bad resurrection of old-style Blues from the South. He gets more popularity he deserves, but thats true for most mainstream artists of the 2000's."
1,the selling out of an indie artist,"when artists gain popularity and submit to the demand of listeners by following new record company standards no one is very surprised. in the case of jack johnson, who owns his own label, this comes completely out of no where. he became john mayer and jason mraz on this album. he got married and had a kid which essentially means that soon after he lost his balls. it does not make any sense! go ahead and buy this so that the sales go up and he can be on the amazon top seller list. go do it, and pat yourself on the back, because he'll make more crap again. and then you can tell your wide-eyed grand children that you helped contribute to the ""great killing of all that is good"" at the beginning of the 21st century."
2,I'm missing something,"What is the deal with Jack Johnson. I just find all of his music so boring, I don't get it! Maybe I need to see him live...."
4,Pretty Good.,"This is a pretty good pickup. After listening to this album, you'll probably feel good about yourself and be in a pleasant mood; that's just the kind of CD it is. It's a nice, soft sound that was seriously lacking from my music collection.Sitting, Waiting, Wishing is clearly the best track on this cd. It's about that crush I think everyone has had at one time or another... it eerily sounded like it was coming straight from my head.I reccommend this album."
4,Easygoin',"Jack Johnson does it again with his soft voice and his 'chill' acoustic sound. This CD is simply easy listening with catchy lil' acoustic jams. No screaming or any of that mumbo jumbo, just good ol' music.I'd imagine that you have heard the singles ""Sitting, Waiting, Wishing"" or perhaps ""Better Together"". Both are extremely catchy, just like MOST of the songs on the CD, a couple exceptions like the French-spoken ""Belle"".Just like all the other reviews mention, the songs and CD as a whole are all very short--no more than 3:30 for a song, and not over 40:00 for the entire CD. So maybe pick this up by buying per song, the CD as a whole might be overpriced.Favorite Song: ""Banana Pancakes"" The ultimate Jack Johnson Song with fun lyrics and smooth beat."
5,cool summer music,"Coming from Britain we havent had much from Jack Johnson until this summer. Having first heard him on a surf trip to New Zealand a couple of years ago, im glad hes caught up in UK. His music is a refreshing change to half the rubbish thats aired on the radio and probably one of the best things to come out of the states.Maybe not eveyones cup of tea, but pretty much most of my mates whove listened have gone and got a copy as well as copies of On and On and Brushfire fairytales.There seems to be a few negative reviews and judgements of Jack and the people who listen to his music, I can only assume it is from Layabouts with no jobs who just sit, bored on the internet with nothing worthwhile to do with the miserable lives, only a thought and I believe in each to their own, but get a life.As for the Music, Fresh, vibrant and full of good meaning, its a great way to chill out, go to the beach, play at a bbq. There may be negativity out there but jacks having a great time in UK."
5,You won't be disappointed!,"I was iffy about buying this CD. I really liked hearing a couple of the songs on the radio, but wasn't sure if it would be worth getting the whole CD. Well, it definitely was! I love every song except ""Staple it together"", which annoys me for some unknown reason. This was my first jack johnson CD, and I am buying more."
5,Bought it twice!,"Bought this for my husband and, after listening to it steadily for 3 weeks, bought it for my sister-in-law. Great car CD."
5,Jack Johnson's In Between Dreams,"Absolutely his best so far....great melodies, enchanting beats, all reflecting the spirit of aloha in his soul."
4,Good Vibes,This is a great compilation if you like relaxing guitar music and vocals with a quirky twist.
2,The triumph of the mediocre,"Sorry, I can't see it.I have given Jack a listen and he is just so modest in his singing, his lyrics and his guitar playing.I can only assume it is precisely his mediocrity that makes him popular. To me, sort of offensively inoffensive. He is no Ben Harper... or Xavier Rudd or John Butler etc if you want that sort of thing. Get someone with guts and talent and something to say.He gets a couple of stars because he likes the sea and he is in no way horrible."
2,"Pleasant, but not memorable...","POSITIVE:The album is a nice listen, with nice acoustic guitar melodies. It is definitely better than his other releases.NEGATIVE:This album is unbearably accessible. Every song sounds the same and is the epitome of easy listening, adult-contemporary-radio-hits, boring, unexciting, more-of-the-same, i'm-not-taking-my-music-seriously light ""rock"" music that is suitable for a grocery store or hospital. The album is so inexpicalbly uncreative, and Jack Johnson never tries to write any thoughtful lyrics that you'd actually sit down and think about. Look further for something that will actually remembered, song for song. Please please look up these bands.If You're Looking For...LIGHT POPBelle & SebastianALTERNATIVE ROCKBloc PartyWilcoModest MouseBadly Drawn BoyWolf ParadeThe Postal ServiceMODERN ROCKJetThe SubwaysThe StrokesArctic MonkeysCLASSIC ROCKThe StoogesX-Ray Spex(I will update this list when I can.)rock on!"
2,whatever,"I have this cd on now and I zzzzzzzzz. Oh, Sorry. I was about to say that Jack zzzzzzz. It happened again! Jack Johnson's music is pleasant and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....."
3,shortand sweet,"In short, Brushfire Fairytales (5 stars), On and On (1 star). This disc sits pretty much rightin the middle. I can'tgive it a half star or I'd lean towards four because, compared to everyone else, it's a pretty decent disc. I'm just too bitter when it comes to artists losing what they once had. So, if you are too, and you've never listened to Jack Johnson before, star here. THEN immediately go and buy ""Brushfire."""
5,love love love,great cd for a cheap price! love jack johnson and had never heard some of the songs on this album
3,Not so bad,My first CD arrived in several pieces. Company was easy to get a hold of and they replaced it within a few days.
1,ick.,This vocal style has become somewhat popular over the last few years....and i just don't get it. There are others out there with a similar sound.I can picture Jack Johnson as the typical college douchebag....sitting in the grass on the university grounds wearing his sandals and strumming his guitar...and two or three silly and naive girls sitting around him...marveling at how talented and sensitive he is. :eyes rolling:
4,Really Really Good,This is just a really easy CD to listen to. My wife commented to me that hearing the work makes us both want to get back to Hawaii to hang out - it is laid back - it is Jack - it is good. JVD
3,No Doubt There is Talent But...,"There is no doubt that Jack Johnson has talent and that he has some great tracks. Sitting, Wishing, Waiting is an absolute hit and I love that song (learn to play it on the guitar!). I was excited for the album but it's not very original. His songs sound really similar to each other with only one or two that are different. I am a fan of his and there is no doubt that he's a great musician but In Between Dreams just isn't AMAZING. For new fans of his it certainly lives up to standards and you won't be disappointed."
3,Jimmy Buffett meets Dave Matthews... Don't like it too much,"I have not been moved by Jack Johnson's ""In Between Dreams"". Sure, he's got a groove going (makes me think of a crossover between Jimmy Buffett and Dave Matthews) and it's not an outright bad production, but I can think of several works of other songwriters/guitarists that I would rather listen to than this album. For instance, I would recommend lamost any album by Josh Rouse, Joseph Arthur or Paul Brill any day. The only song that stands out of the rest is ""Belle"". Other than that, I wouldn't endorse the album in any particular way. I will go check out his previous works, though."
5,This is the best Album I have ever bought!,This is the best Album I have bought in a long time and possibly ever. People keep saying that this is not as good of an album as some of Jack's earlier work but I think this is great and is a great follow up to his already great career. This is a album that you can listen straight through without skipping a track. With all the stupid music that is played on the radio and Television this is a refreshing album and Jack Johnson is just a very talented artist and seems like an all together nice man. If you are looking for a great album than buy this. I can not wait to attend Jack Johnson's concert this summer. After hearing this wonderful album it convinced me to run out and buy concert tickets to his show. I can't wait to see him live check out his website www.jackjohnsonmusic.com if you want to learn more about him or if you want to check out when he is coming to your town. And if you live in Michigan he is coming August 31 to MeadowBrook.
3,Great Beach Music,"This album is one of my favorites from Jack Johnson. My 2 1/2 old daughter also loves singing to it.It is great music to listen to and relax while doing household chores, cooking etc... It just puts you in such a happy and relaxed mood. My favorite time to play it is when we're staying at the beach. I highly recommend it.."
5,Excellent,"I don't have his other two albums, but I bought this on the day it came out. Popped it in the cd player and was slightly disappointed. As another reviewer said, the songs all kind of sounded the same and were ""OK"". However, with a few more listens, I was totally hooked. This is an excellent album. I'm gonna buy the other two now."
5,Most Excellent!,"Awesome. If Jack keeps making albums like this, i'm going to be broke. Buy it. You'll thank me for telling you to. This whole CD is excellent for cruising to the beach or just hanging out. Amazing!"
4,A solid and beautiful album.,"The new cd is fantastic! I didn't feel that his second cd, On and On, quite matched up to his first. But this one really is great. It's still early, so I can't say I like it better than Brushfire Fairytales, but it's definately up there.It is Jack Johnsons most upbeat cd--lots of funky songs, but also lots of chill songs. A great mix.[The missteps? The song Belle is just over 1 minute long with some french words. Just strange that he included it.]Overall, there are great song choices on here. Lots of really great stuff! Check it out!!"
5,Jack Johnson - In Between Dreams,"This CD is really, really good! I just found out about Jack Johnson and he is so laid back and upbeat at the same time! It's great music for any time, party, relaxing, cleaning house, exercising, cooking, any time! I consider myself to be a very good judge when it comes to music and J.J. is a 10 in my opinion! Good for all ages!"
3,Good collection for the road,"Better Together and the other first six tracks feature great music for a rainy day and the car. I like listening to this album when I'm alone, it's no gem and no it wouldnt last more than two years in my cd player. I strongly suggest people to check out My Morning Jacket's AT DAWN or IT STILL MOVES.Although Jack Johnson is good, there isnt much variation in his music and by no means or ways, is he anywhere near being called the best at what he does. Ben Lee's AWAKE IS THE NEW SLEEP is another good cd with better lyrics.In Between Dreams is good harmless listening,nonetheless. Too much better music in the world,fellas."
3,Good enough for a relaxed listener !,"Good enough to just listen and relax on your way to work in the mornings. Some songs are fun and his relaxed tone is a unique one in my CD collection ! This said, his truest work is on his first ""Brushfire"" album; all of his qualities as a singer song-writter are there, plus the lyrics are at they're best on content and inventivness all the way through the recording ( Guess i should have rated Brushfire instead ). ""In Between"" is a relaxed continuation of his work, you can get this album to support and thank this artist for the job he's done, but to the date, I think ""Brushfire Fairytales"" remains unsurpassable."
3,Hit and miss,"I have mixed feelings about this disc. As always, Jack Johnson shows his ability to write moving songs with a lot of truth (see ""Do You Remember""). But in other spots, his lyrics just completely miss the mark for me, and seem almost nave. In the song ""Good People,"" Jack asks ""Where did all the good people go? I've been changing the channels, I don't see them on the tv shows."" I can see what these lyrics are getting at regarding the difficulty of living in a world that often lacks a moral compass, but in feigning confusion Jack comes across as more sheltered than worldly, and even sounds mean and critical. Overall, I think he's at his best when touching upon small, personal themes like in ""Banana Pancakes."" I listen to this album a lot, and it has that mellow, sweet, and relaxing sound I've come to expect from Jack Johnson, but sometimes I have to take the lyrics with a grain of salt."
4,He's great.,"I think that Brushfire Fairytales was a better listen-track for track. It amazes me how he can come up with fresh melodies that have you humming them after the first listen. ""Banana Pancakes"" falls into the loopy lovesong catagory that I love so much. Just like ""Bubble Toes"" from his first album. I can't wait for his next venture."
5,never tire of this CD,"I consider a CD very good if I enjoy more that 4 songs on it. I can't get enough of this CD. Favorite tracks are: Better together, Banana pancakes, Breakdown, Sitting etc. and Good people. Its a refreshing sound versus the same commercialized stuff that the radio/tv plays over and over again. His sound similiar to that of John Mayer and Maroon 5 but his songs are more simple with regards to instruments used, mostly acoustic guitar, and a little bit of piano."
5,A Good Stand Alone Movie if you haven't seen the series,"I've never watch the full series of Kimagure Orange Road (48 episodes plus 3 OVAs....I think) but this movie is really good. I didn't quite understand when I first saw it back in 2004 when I was 13 (I watched the 2001 ADV release, but this is the same movie, just a re-release) but after watching it again last year, I understood it and it made me want to watch the series. This is a great anime film even if you've never seen the series. I highly recommend this movie to any anime fan who enjoys a romantic drama that's good for guys and girls. I just wish they dubbed the anime in English but I guess I'll have to make do with reading subtitles, at least this movie is dubbed in English. Thank You ADV!!! (Even though you went out of business.) :("
5,One of my favs!,"This movie is one of my all time favorite anime movies. The animation is great and so is the story line. I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes anime and even if you don't like anime, it still has a great storyline!"
1,Is there an option to give 0 stars?,"This CD is awful. Sorry September, but Mrs. King isn't even in the same ballpark as a country legend like ""Emmylou"" Harris. It's a shame she has to exploit her marriage to Larry King to promote this CD.Did anyone catch her Dr. Phil performance a few weeks ago - ouch :(Dont waste your money."
3,Iron Ore Railroad basics,"The Lake Superior Iron Ore Railroads is a good basic look at the iron ore dock structures and tonnages hauled at the time of writing. I had hoped for historical information on steam engines used by the various lines but it wasn't there. Still a good, informative read."
4,A good book for the era,"Of course, there's data, info, and pics to thrill the iron ore fan, even if some of the charts and graphs are painfully amateurish. Some photo captions are also a bit wanting. All-in-all, however, I'm happy with it."
4,Just Off Main Street,"I have just finished reviewing this book delivered to the Mountain EAR newspaper in the Conways, NH. I have a weekly column there, entitled COUNTRY ECOLOGY, in which I cover a lot of the same material this book is about. I feature more on bird habitat and the wildlife forage trees and shrubs, along with ecological profiles of our native birds and mammals. I could have answered some of the questions posed in this book, despite its great depth of insightful knowledge about the environment. The book covers the cycle of the seasons, and as any naturalist knows, there is always something going on and we live in the midst of it. Stephen Mulak's book introduces the New England reader to this existence and moves one along nicely. I like his writing, and it is somewhat similar to my own. I wish success for this book, as we all need to move our lives' interactions deeper in this manner."
5,Fast & Utile,"This utility is a must-have for web-browsing. The clean-up (of Internet History, Cache, ActiveX, Cookies & Plug-ins) after every session is remarkably fast and efficient. It's worth the price for the system registry cleaner and fixer by themselves, but has MANY other worthwile functions and uses far less memory than Norton."
1,Wasted money on this product,"I had a broken FAT, and the DiskFixer utility did not recognize the broken drive. The only reason I bought SystemSuite was to recover data on a damaged boot partition drive. The drive was visible to Windows Explorer, but when I clicked on it, Explorer said it was not formatted. SystemSuite's DiskFixer didn't even show it as a selection to fix! I tried the PC Diagnostics tool, and that saw the drive and said it was fine. Their FixUp Wizard just skipped the drive. The File Undeleter did not see this drive. V Communications Technical Support's answer was to try to sell me Data Recovery services. Useless set of tools. R-Studio from R-TT worked GREAT!!!"
1,Program Crashes/No Support!,"Have had nothing but trouble trying to use this product. It crashes each time I try cookie removal, disk defrag, scandisk, etc... Had to reinstall w/98 in order to get control of my system back.Have tried several e-mails over a one week span trying to get Ontract support... Yet, as of this writing, I have had absolutely no reply other than their immediate automated replies acknowledging each of my e-mails.I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they also want to face the probability of a great deal of lost time i.e.... Having to reinstall w/98 and rebuild their system.I'm totally disappointed in the product and in the support, as well as in the reviews on this site, which were a major factor in my buying decision...Will be returning Ontract's System Suite 2000 and requesting a full refund!"
5,"A wonderfully written, accurate psychological story","A chilling, but realistic, account of a young boy's slow decent into depression and isolation. Aiken is truly a master of his craft, using exquisite narrative style to draw the reader into the main character's mind.Aiken wrote numerous novels and short stories, many of them based on psychoanalytic theory. This short story is regarded to be one of his best, a true classic."
1,Bad packaging,"I bought this chest along with the console and mirror, and magazine rack end table. The chest was delivered damaged due to being packed upside down in the box. Amazon.com was great about arranging for a replacement and pick-up for the damaged unit. Sadly the second one was damaged in exactly the same place. One corner of the top was crushed due to someone dropping the carton. Because it was packed upside-down, the impact landed on the top corner instead of the feet. After two replacements, I gave up."
4,Probably the greatest two espionage novellas ever written.,"The first two stories in this compilation of episodes from the colorful career of one Sam Mcready a.k.a ""The Deceiver"" are worth their weight in gold. The first one deals with a thrilling infiltration into East Germany with a variety of twists and turns. The second story details the defection of a senior KGB officer who creates a rift between the British MI6 and the CIA. The final two stories are more run-of-the-mill, but Forsyth fans will not be disappointed."
4,great Cold War espionage,"Frederick Forsyth delivers thrilling tales of Cold War espionage in The Deceiver. The book is a collection of novellas that revolve around the career of one of British intelligence's most effective operatives. Unfortunately for that operative, he is being sent by the new administration into quiet retirement on the eve of the end of the Cold War. Using a committee review of that operative's career to link the individual episodes, Forsyth provides another entertaining character in thrilling spy tales."
3,This book is getting worst from one story to the other,"This book has 4 different stories, in all of them appear Spy McCready as a super hero, the book will keep you interested in the stories but is not exactly what I expected from Forsyth.The first story has 4 stars.The second story has 5 stars.The third story has 3 stars.Don't waste your time with the fourth one."
3,"Better Without the ""Friction"" Material","I was disappointed to find how few products like this were available when I was shopping, but I selected this knowing it was not exactly what I wanted. The ""friction"" material makes it very difficult to add and remove belts from the hanger. Fortunately, it can be cut off very easily. Otherwise, this does the job fine."
3,This is just okay,3 of my belts have buckles that are too small to have the black part thread through so I have to fold them over the loop. It's just okay.
4,i might be a bit generous with the stars,"I've found the O. Henry Awards series to be a pretty uneven collection of stories, but still one i eagerly await each year, because in each volume you find several good stories, and one or two gems. The 1999 collection is no exception. Sure I found most of the stories to be trite and dull, but hidden amongst the poorer work were really good stories by W.D. Wetherell, Michael Chabon, Charlotte Forbes, and Annie Proulx. And the second place story, Cary Holladay's 'Merry-Go-Sorry' is a great story that deserves to be anthologized many, many in the years to come. And Stephen King and Lorrie Moore's introduction were eloquently written, and a joy to read in their own right."
1,Bad . . . really bad.,"A sort of ""cute"" concept that just doesn't go anywhere, and is not at all well written. The only saving grace is that it is so short, reading took very little time."
1,Our Wedding Journal,"I've been looking for a wedding journal that was similar to my parents and I was excited to find this one. However, when when I received the book it definitely had some ware to it although it had been described as new. The book was very dirty, there was actual dirt on the book that needed to be washed off. The book pages were discolored and the spine was bent and worn down. There was tape with what looks like wrapping paper stuck to the book as well. They also over charged me more than the book was worth, trying to cover up the original price which was nearly $5.00 less when it was bought new. I was very unhappy with this product and sent it back."
4,A Realistic reflection of a visit to a zen moastery,A tale of a realistic spiritual journey to a foreign country.Heart warming and uplifting.Natural uncut footage.Organic and grounded in life.
4,Happy surprise --- so glad I said Yes,"I am a difficult, snarly customer at any video store: cautious, suspicious, what an old grouch. ENLIGHTENMENT GUARANTEED was suggested for a more positive experience after I hated Leigh's Another Year. Brave woman to recommend it. I love this movie. How can European directors and actors come up with such a human and loving depiction of what could be treated -- by someone else -- as a negative sleazy downer? The relationship between the two brothers is a marvel --- it was like seeing two actual guys who had known and been fond of each other for many years. I love this movie. The determined Zen of one is played off against the determined ""oh well, what the hell"" of the other --- and that's the joy of it --- nobody wins over anyone else. Did I say I love this movie?"
2,enlightenment gauranteed,"This film was very boring and the main characters were very unenlightenment ( unintelligent) and it really did not reflect much about the true spirit of Zen Buddhism. It was just very boring and empty. Not really worth the time watching if you really want to know Zen and are curious about the subject, Dont waste your money or time."
3,Great,"This is a totally kick ... album. Not as good as 'Room for abuse', but contains some fantastic tunes."
1,Upgrading to the point of uselessness,"I've been a Quicken fan for years. My financial institution just forced me to upgrade from Quicken 2000 Deluxe to Quicken 2002 Basic. I loved Quicken 2000 Deluxe, but Quicken 2002 Basic is a slow, slow, slow memory hog that crashes frequently. As with most software providers, Intuit has also made it very inconvenient and costly to get support. Guess I'll hafta move on to MS Money."
3,Bugs in Quicken 2002 Deluxe,"While overall Quicken is still a superb financial tracking software package its tax section still leaves much to be desired. Their newest feature, showing the effects of altering the number of exemptions, is completely non-functional. After entering my information it estimated my current withholding at 3 times what it currently is and given the annual information entered stated I was entitled to a $15,000 refund (I wish). While I have been a Quicken user for many years, and will continue to do so, I have been and continue to be extremely disappointed with the tax management tools of their program."
5,I love Quicken!,"Despite what the masses say here, I think Quicken 2002 and my previous version, 2000, are the best thing that's ever happened to my personal finances. I use Quicken for budgeting, savings goals, online payments, online billing, and for management of several credit card accounts and several bank accounts. Budgeting is made really easy by using the built-in categories and categories I've created. I can even split a transaction between multiple categories. I've had no problems with the product and can't help but wonder if some of the negative reviews posted here are from within Microsoft. They have been known to do such things."
3,Quciken Home & Business,"Being a first time user I found Quicken to be very difficult to understand and assumes everyone will use the complete online features to manage the home and business expenses, retirement and other accounts. I found it very difficult to download files from my financial accounts and import them in to Quicken. Also, when it asks you to set up your account (Online), you must know your service provider DNS, Proxy ID and security stuff. I am still learning it, it is not easy for those of us from the non-account world. Tks, AD"
2,I still can't make it work for ISOs,"I have some ISO stock options with my employer which allow me to exercise the options prior to vesting - apparently this is a new tax law for employees of startup companies. Quicken lets you set up a stock option account, and assign a value to the options but when you try to buy/exercise prior to vesting, it says - no options vested, and doesn't allow you to purchase!This means when it comes time to sell your capital gains are all screwed up. It makes me wonder if Turbotax can handle these things correctly - yikes!The rest of the program is ok."
3,"Still a great product, but disappointing upgrade","Having been a Quicken user for more than ten years and having recently upgraded from Quicken 2000, this new version is a disappointment. There aren't any compelling new features (the new reports are nice, but how many do you need?) On the downside: (1) it's much slower to open, (2) it has lots of gimicky links to more stuff to purchase from Intuit. Example: On the Finance Menu there's an item that says ""Manage Payroll"". Click on it and you get a ad telling you to buy QuickPayroll. You can't turn this junk off.It's not horrible, it's just stupid.I regret having upgraded but once your file is converted and you've updated data you can't go back. If you have Quicken 2K or later and are satisfied, pass on this one."
1,Very Buggy,"I am a long, long time Quicken user. I track over 200 stocks using Quicken. I upgraded to 2002 Deluxe from Quicken 99. It was a disaster. The new program tried to convert my files to the new file system in 2002 and lost them all. It caused a General Windows Fault every time I tried to access my portfolio. I tried to uninstall Quicken 2002 and reinstall Quicken 99 (which had worked flawlessly for 4 years) and now it causes Windows to crash.Quicken technical help tried to charge me $2.00/minute to help me. They won't even talk to you until you give them your credit card number. The whole thing is a disaster. Why did I ever try to upgrade?"
2,More problems with Quicken 2002,"I echo others that have had problems with Quicken 2002. I recently tried to upgrade from 2000 and like others have had problems with the data files being corrupted. Technical support has been no help. It seems that this is a common problem. The program will loose data or corrupt it and then you are lost. The only advice given by technical support is to start over and re-enter each account one at a time. This takes hours and hours. I did this and the program still has glitches. Intuit needs to do a better job of converting the files and making sure all past data can be transported from one version to another. Unlike others, running supervalidate or validate does not correct the problems. Data when recreating the main accounts is not available, such as what was in any retirement planning previously created or data in a home loan that might have been tied to certain accounts. If I had it to do over I would have stayed with Quicken 2000."
1,Don't Buy it,"I am very computer literate, but have never used any of the computer-based money management software before. Having finallydecided to take the plunge and put all our finances on the computer, and figuring that Quicken was a well-known, well-respected name in financial software, we bought the Quicken 2002 Deluxe edition. Quite frankly, the program is awful.It is extremely buggy which is bad enough, but there is VIRTUALLY NO USER SUPPORT!!!! In order to find out how to overcome the bugs in the software, you must pay [per]/min (plus your long distance charges) to talk to someone who likely cannot help you.Unless you already know quicken and so don't need any help at all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUYING THIS SOFTWARE."
1,VERY BUGGY! Don't waste your money,"The last 3 versions of Quicken have been very buggy. This one is no different. I would not recommend buying Quicken until they show some interest in quality. Considering the poor quality of the software, it is very disappointing that they offer no technical support.The biggest problem I have is that it won't print. All my other Windows applications print fine. I have also found arithmatic errors, and it crashes often under Windows ME (this problem has been fixed by upgrading to Windows XP.)"
2,Should have stayed at Deluxe 98,"I finally bought a bummer from Quicken. After staying at Quicken 98 all this time, I decided to upgrade to Quicken Deluxe 2002. What a waste of money! I purchased this mess back in July 2002, and have already reverted back to the 98 Deluxe version. 2002 is a cluttered, user-unfriendly interface. It automatically creates a list of Scheduled Transactions (an unmanageable one) which you have to fight with to go away The list of annoying and tedious ""enhancements"" is too long for this format. STAY AWAY from this version."
2,Umm ... it doesn't crash often.,"I was a big fan of Quicken 5 years ago, but this version is abysmal. Features that are advertised on the box, but ""discontinued"", a user interface that takes some time to get used to, and a serious bug that I can't get anyone at Quicken to respond to. I created a 401k account, added two mutual funds, gave them both initial balances, then corrected the balances when I found my account information. The problem is that the updated amounts are correct in the register, but are not correct in any other reports. I can't get it to refresh the data in the reports without deleting the account. I give up. Going to try to find a copy of Quicken from the mid 90's."
2,I am disappointed with Quicken 2002 Deluxe,"I have used Quicken since switching from Managing Your Money about 10 years ago. ...I must say I am very disappointed with the current version. I find it less intuitive and friendly than the previous versions and the layout of the My Finances page is not as good as Q2000. Then I found that the net worth reports and graphs are screwed up. How could Intuit release a product with such a glaring flaw? If you want to track anything with a home finance program wouldn't you want to know what you are worth? If I just wanted to balance my checking account I would use Excel.I have resisted going to MS Money because home finance is about the last software market left not dominated by Microsoft. However, if the current version of Quicken is an indication of the Intuit's direction I may move to Money in the near future."
2,Sometimes too much is not enough!,"I am a veteran user of Personal Finance software...having started using Managing Your Money nearly 15 years ago with the purchase of my first (20 meg hard drive) 286 computer. MYM served me well until both the system became outdated and I 'switched' through my bank to Quicken. What was a tremendous idea and approach 15 years ago now has evolved into layers and layers of complexity. While Quicken can be used for simple checkbook tracking and reconciliation, the menu-laden program seems much more difficult to use. I have now created a much simpler version within Excel which serves my simple purposes most simplistically. Quicken should offer a $9.95 feature-free checkbook version."
2,brain dead user interface,"Something is truly brain dead about the web-style user interface in Quicken 2002 Deluxe.Discovering how to write a check is a major research project.Menu links appear and disappear as you ""browse"" through the application.The impulse to improve the interface was noble, but something went terribly wrong in the execution."
5,Satisfied User of Previous Quicken Versions,"I have used Quicken from Version 3 and have found it to be the easiest way to manage my home finances. I have yet to purchase Quicken 2002 but I am sure I will in the very near future.Intended first time purchasers need have no fear, Quicken is the simplest piece of software to both set-up and use."
1,A little overrated,"Mr. Chapman has touched on the concept of smelting, but has not come close to supplying the information that would be needed if one was attempt to do what he proposes in his book. He seems to demonstrate a basic concept of smelting, but I suggest that readers do a little more research beyond Mr. Chapmans expertize before you start any smelting processes."
1,LOUSY,"AMATEURISH, A BOOK THAT MUST HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN, FULL OF CAMPY CLIPART AND REPETITIVE WARNINGS.REMOVE THOSE AS WELL AS THE OVERSIZED TYPE FACE AND YOU HAVE AN EIGHT PAGE PAMPHLET!THE BOOK REALLY HAS LITTLE VALUE TO A PROFESSIONAL, SERIOUS STUDENT OF METALLURGY, OR A PROSPECTOR SEEKING INFORMATION ON SMELTING OR REFINING HIS METALS.THIS IS A BOOK FULL OF WORDS BUT EMPTY OF KNOWLEDGE."
3,pretty nice,"I wasnt crazy about the tack welds on these, but barely notice once installed. The old aluminum hinges that were on it were seized up something fierce. I ended up cutting the hinges off and then taking the screws out afterwards. Do yourself a favor and buy some really good impact torx bits. I broke lots of T40's on my 2000 wrangler in the rust belt."
3,"Cheap stainless, but do the trick","These hinges are just okay. They are made of cheap-looking stainless, with low-quality welding. They're a bit thin, and seem like they wouldn't take the same amount of abuse as the factory set.That being said, they hold my rear gate on, and that is why I bought them. If I were really into the outward appearance of my car, I would probably go another route, or at least spray paint these so they don't draw any undue attention."
3,"Not much of a mystery, but good local flavor","The caper is strictly by the numbers -- I figured out whodunit long before Goldberg's protagonist. But this book will still be enjoyable for anyone familiar with the Portland countercultural scene of the early to mid '90s, especially the milieu surrounding community station KBOO and related local grass-roots media. Any resemblance to real persons living or dead is probably pretty accurate, but you can't prove anything!!"
3,Just the place to start,"This game is excellent for those just getting into the world of MTG. It teaches all the basics of gameplay, and gives detailed statistics of your decks as you build them. However, it uses 4th edition cards and only the expansions from so long ago. I was hoping to make decks in the game matching those I use in real life, and was entirely disappointed. Also, the concept of rare cards is defeated in this game. It's fun to pass the time away, but not everything I hoped it to be. I was not able to get it to run on windows 2000 professional, or windows xp, so if you run on those systems beware. A final note when playing against other people. The game has some bugs dealing with anything except lan(local area networks). myself and my friends could not get the modem gaming to work."
2,Origional vs Rewrite,"I have the great luck to have a copy of this book's first edition, 1947. It went through a major editing in 1970 by the Editors of Mother Earth News. It was edited again, very badly by the editors of Gardenway 1973. The original is very definitely a book, all 326 pages with index. A second edition came out in 1948/9 that added a reference for further reading at the end of each chapter. Most of these pamphlets and books referred to here were were printed by the Country Bookstore which latter became Gardenway and then Storey. Look for the original hardback ca 1947 or 1948 for the second edition. You will have much more satisfaction. There are so many places that ham handed editing have made this book a man's only book. It spends most of its time out side and leaves the kitchen/harvest room to be worked out by the wife and an architect. Giving you no idea what is needed in the way of space, layout or basic equipment."
3,Classic Back to the Land Pamphlet,"The Have More Plan is more of a long pamphlet than a book. Chatty prose and descriptions of the authors' life on their homestead. An excellent discussion and plan for a real WORKING kitchen. Nearly all of the information is sadly dated, but it does give an interesting look into the lives of early back to the land pioneers--without the political posturing that the Nearings (Helen and Scott) seem to be unable to avoid. Add it to your library of small farming books, but you may find the actual USEABLE information to be thin."
3,some useful info,Some useful info. Many spelling errors and it would be nice to be able to see the pictures or diagrams referenced throughout the ebook
4,Fun blast from the past,"This booklet is fun, but dated. Of course a lot of dated info can be made to fit our times, and some is more fitted to today then in the 40's when this was first printed! Having been a farmer most of my life, the info here is solid and Mrs. Robinson's advice to readers is humorously old-fashioned, but poignant in this new revolution of homesteading. There are several useful ideas for animal structures that I may implement. It includes a good garden planting reference."
2,"Disappointing map, not quite what I was expecting.","This was a disappointing map with not the detail I was expecting. I have a much better one from AAA but it is 2001 and I was hoping for something similar with more detail of individual towns and cities but for 2008. It was okay for a quick review before getting into the car but it's size and ""flimsyness"" made it impossible to use in the car by the passenger in the front seat. Maybe a back seat passenger could have managed it."
3,Nice but not beautiful.,"I purchased this watch over a year ago and I'm happy with it. It's very plain and like the other reviewer said kind of small. My wrist measures 6 inches and the face of the watch measures 7/8 in. It looks better in the picture than in person although I kept mine and still wear it. My mother, who has a petite wrist put in on and it looks very pretty. So keep in mind if your looking for an everyday watch it's a good choice at a fair price but if you have a larger wrist think about a watch with a larger bezel."
2,eh...blah,"I was not very happy with this watch. Its' very small. I'm sure someone with a smaller wrist would love it. It's just a plain watch too...nothing exciting or extraordinary about it...not quite sure why I even bought it in the first place (oh yeah..I'm an impulse shopper)...in any case, I've returned it....the picture was a lot prettier than the watch."
2,permit badge,i received the wrong badge i returned it as per instuctions and i have not received it yet going on 1 month
4,Nice trinket.,"It will look good in my gun-case. Nice memorabilia of my first CCW permit. Seams to be built solid, and looks better in person then the pictures. The only thing I don't like about it... The plating chipped off in spots on the space provided under the ""PERMIT"" when I had it engraved. I will paint that flat spot to mask the flaking whilst still being able to read the engraving.(Please do not buy this to carry for WHATEVER reason! It is a novelty and nothing more!)"
2,Is very nice but,"Is in good conditions but the clip don't work when I use it it keeps fooling off , also I been trying to fix it my self ."
5,Excellent book!,I have read many books on this topic. It ismy favorite topic. However this is the first book I have read that actually touches on the fact that we are them and more importantly who Jesus really was. Many Christians would be shocked to read this but it is the ONLY story that makes any sense. Love this book!!!
2,"""The Forty Niners"" not a prize winner","""The Forty Niners: Chronicle of the California Trail and El Dorado"" tells the story of the thousands of people that rushed to the California foothills in search of gold. People packed up their belongings and headed toward what they believed would be a new, promising life. What they found was a little different than they had hoped. This book gives a good view of just how these settlers lived and what they had to go through. It is a good historical book, and it taught me a lot about my country's history. Most of the book was pretty interesting, but at times it was a little slow. I think it could have been made a little shorter. If you are looking for a book that is so good that you can't put it down, this isn't it. At a few points, I was almost looking for an excuse to put it down. However, if California history is appealing to you, you may be interested in reading this book."
4,great!,"I really enjoyed this book == enlightening, entertaining, and educational. Definitely worth reading!"
5,A very good read,I found this book to be well written; I enjoy reading about real people in real situations.This author's book about Fred Harvey was equally enjoyable.
2,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,This product is cheap... This light flickers on and off because the battery dosen't fit the whole unit properly (they are different color yellow) causing the connection to fail a lot. I charge it all the time but it makes not difference. I will be investing in something much better soon. I'll limp it through..
1,Garbage out of the box,"I ordered this product last December for work. Worked 4 times for 5 minutes after hitting the power switch and it completely stopped working. Called Bayco and they suggested that maybe it was just a bulb. So I wasted another $8.00 on a bulb. No change.I bought a Makita the next day because I really did not have time to play around with Bayco. They told me I would have to pay shipping and handling to have them look at it. Fed up (and unaware that Amazon had a return policy) I threw it in the closet and forgot about it until now. And I come to find out that Amazon WOULD HAVE taken this piece of crap back. Not anymore.I'll send this junker back to Bayco, pay the shipping, then sell it on Craigslist to at least get my money back on the shipping and feel like at least I made Bayco fix this.Thank you for the wonderful product Amazon. Should have pulled it from your inventory when the first guy said it stunk. News flash: Bayco doesn't retail this unit anymore. Can't imagine why....."
1,Don't ever get!!,"This product SUCKS!!!! It does not last 4 hours, even when the battery is on the charger for 3 days. About 15 minutes of light, that's all. Don't buy!"
3,Very basic,"""Learn to Dance Bachata Volume 1"" is decent overall if you have never done any Bachata. I have taken a few Bachata classes, and I was expecting a lot more out of this video. This video would have been better if they had included a few more patterns."
3,"Better if this reflected true Albanian pronunciation, not Kosovo","I studied ""standard"" Albanian years ago, and was disapppointed this book reflects a dialect spoken, really, outside of Albania. Standard Albanian is based on the Tosk (southern) dialect; this book (and audio materials) are based on the Kosovo dialect. The book is fantastic, otherwise. It would be better if the spoken material taught were based on ""true"" or Standard Albanian as are most dictionaries and phrasebooks."
4,Civil War Juvenile Fiction: The Mosquito Fleet,"When I was a child, I read all of the books by GordonShirreffs in the public library's Boys and Girls Department. I remembered enjoying all of them. So when our nephew became interested in the Civil War, I wanted to share those books with him. I'm disappointed that they're no longer in print, but glad that we now have internet used book searches. This book, The Mosquito Fleet, is about the war on the Mississippi, a fight that involved ships that looked like nothing seen before or since. I recommend this book for children who are interested in the Civil War, or for children who just like an exciting story. (Standard disclaimer: my opinions are my own, and not necessarily those of my employer.)"
3,Bizarre,"I've seen a lot of Asian horror films, but this has got to be the weirdest movie I've ever seen in my life. About halfway through the movie I began to get confused. My confusion only got worse from there. It did not stop me from watching the entire movie, though. I'm not really sure how certain things got to be how they are in the film, and would have liked an explanation, but no big deal. It's not a fantastic movie; but if you've got time to kill and want to see something a little different, I'd recommend watching it."
4,Window posters,I bought 3 of zehn Huan posters and hung them as windows in my very dark bedroom. I also attached a night lamp to a timer. The lamps go on at 7 am in 3 different places/windows in the room. It helps me emulate sun light and wake up in a good mood. I found them a bit expensive as reproductions.
4,Simple and to the point,"This may not be the book for veteran beaders, but for beginners and intermediates looking for a book with informative text, clear color pictures, and suggestions for new layouts and styles beyond the basic single-strand bracelet, it's a good choice. Instructions and pictures are clear and easy to follow. Good discussion of tools and techniques."
5,BEST beginner book,"I purchased this book as a gift to a beginning beader. I am an experienced beader, and I found this book to have many things I wish I had when I first started beading. There is a description of the different shapes of beads and what their names are, rondelle, bicone, etc. There is also a scale diagram of the actual sizes of beads, 4mm, 6mm etc. Very helpful info. I am starting a women's beading co-op in Haiti as a mission project, and this has such great illustrations and pictures, they will be able to learn from this book."
3,A simple book for bare-bones beginnings,"On the surface of it, an ultra-simple, ultra-plain beading book sounds like a fine idea. After all, there's so much you can learn that it can be extremely daunting to the beginner. A simple introductory book is less threatening. And in large part, this works in Jean Campbell's Getting Started Stringing Beads. Unfortunately, beading is a complex hobby, and there's no good way to get around that, particularly if you want to cover all the bases. Going with simple inevitably means leaving things out that you really shouldn't. While the basic information and projects are certainly useful, I didn't end up feeling as though I'd gotten all that far into what I needed to know---and didn't feel ready to tackle the complex virtual aisles of an online beading catalog.Best for dabblers or for people who get easily overwhelmed when learning a new craft---probably perfect for those folks."
5,Great book for beginner beaders,"This is a great book for learning good techniques for selecting and stringing beads, with comprehensive instructions on all the basics including stringing, crimping, knotting, wireworking and much, much more. Also includes lots of great projects with full instructions. Follow the steps and finish up with a wonderful piece of jewellery that you can wear with pride or give to someone as a lovely gift. This is a small book, but packed with information. I love it! I'm a much older beginner to beading and have found it invaluable."
2,What a disappointment...,"I ordered this book because it had such good reviews and it seemed to be a good book for beginning beaders, but I was very disappointed.The book was very general and lacking in detailed instructions. I ended up going to the web and finding what I needed instead."
1,needs a rating.,"This DVD has a lot of graphic violence. Since it has so much violence, it sould have an R Rating, or X or NC-17 Rating, and not a rating of [N.R.]Please don't show this DVD to children under 17."
1,Bad,This is bad. My title review says it all and just check out my reviews for Volumes One and Two instead because I am not going to waste my time on this rubbish...
3,Last Stop,"It was an awesome price for a DVD but the price of shipping was way over the top. The Movie itself was not bad, I only bought it to see Rose McGowans early work."
1,Just Plain Stupid,"It's a pity that such a beautiful, talented actress as Rose McGowan was wasted in this pitiful, boring waste of film. The plot is weak, unoriginal, and laughable, while the acting is beyond atrocious. Whoever did the casting in this movie needs a brainscan. Adam Beach was terrible, comical even!, as the stranded state trooper. Throw in a tough black dude, a womanizing creep, and 2 drunken losers and what you have is the Last Stop...oh yeah, don't forget to add the corpse into the plot for an additional comical element. DO NOT buy this movie. Don't even rent it. You were warned."
2,Bleh. I was very disappointed.,"I give Rose McGowan some sort of credit< one star is on her behalf>, but, geez, no one put any effort into this movie as far as acting! The lead character is mighty horrible. He made Rosie look bad. I fart on his grave! . I fell asleep after 30 min. , but eventually watched the rest out of boredom< and the fact that i cant let ANY movie go unfinished>. THE PRICE IS RIDICULOUS! DONT BUY IT!RENT IT!Use the 100 dollars you might have used for crack... it's more worth it."
2,poor quality,"The information I found in this book was highly inadequate. It was simply a blown out of proportion version of what any beginner in TCM knows the seven spirits and points to needle, I believe I've learned more reading articles posted on the net"
2,poor quality,"The information I found in this book was highly inadequate. It was simply a blown out of proportion version of what any beginner in TCM knows the seven spirits and points to needle, I believe I've learned more reading articles posted on the net. Not only that but Flaws never returned my message or emails and Blue Poppy press ""specifically Joanne"" was rude to me when I requested a refund. I will never do business with Blue Poppy or Bob flaws again."
3,Interesting!!!,"""Chinese Medical Psychiatry"" is a review and synthesis of east and western therapeutics."
4,A Good Read,"I've never read a book about Bid Whist and I have always wondered how the game was played. Lucky for me the directions for Bid Whist are in the begining of the book. The story is based on a group of friends and some not so friendly that meet weekly to play the game. There is a lot of drama in the lives of these players.Some play games and some get played. I like the main character. I liked the way she handled herself and her husbands affairs while trying to help her daughter who is confused and trying to figure life out for herself. This was a good read. I enjoyed it. It was inspirational, laugh out loud funny and the characters are some people you will know. Some you like and some you don't.Reviewed byDawnny"
4,Cute Family Movie -- Even Dogs Love It!,"While at the library renting a few ""rainy day"" movies, I ran across this family movie. My rescued Border Collie mix is extremely smart, and she loves to watch children's movies and tv shows (she absolutely LOVES Barney the purple dinosaur) so I thought perhaps this movie might keep her occupied for a couple of hours on a stormy day when she couldn't play outside. Wow, was I right. She was GLUED to the television the entire time. I thought perhaps it was just a fluke so later in the day I played it a second time, and she again sat still and attentive through almost the entire movie. Since she liked it so much, I purchased her a copy and we have watched it together several times. She is attentive and watches the movie every time it is played, and we're going to take the movie to my sister's house during our next visit to see if her German Shepherd reacts the same way. It is a cute children's movie that even your dog will love!"
4,Cute kid movie!,"Mist is such a cute movie for kids. I wouldn't really recommend it for adults. It's a little corny but my 3 year old LOVES it!! We rented it and she just didn't understand why we had to take it back! I'm planning on getting her one for Christmas. She even pretends she is ""Mist"" the puppy around the house. So don't expect an Oscar award winning movie but it's great for young children!"
4,Works a little slow in my PDA,"Comparing with another Card from Sandisk I feel this card a little slow in my PDA, but it makes his job."
3,Interesting and thought provoking,"Alexander Trocchi's first novel was an interesting work that differed from his later novels, yet displayed his innovative style. While comparisons to Burrrough's are inevitable, this shows drug addicts from another point of view. Trocchi was able to create very interesting characters, especially that of the father in the story, perhaps one of the best descriptions of a character ever. The story is very interesting at first but runs out of steam in the middle, and is able to pick it up somewhat in the end. Leonard Cohen acknowledged this book as an influence on his experimental novel Beautiful Losers. Well worth the read if you are a fan of the genre, but not the place to start."
4,Baby loves it as a teether!,"We got this as a gift for our baby and I didn't care for it much because it looks cheaply made. But my husband insisted on letting our little guy play with it, and lo and behold! He loved it. I've bought all sorts of teethers for him but he uses this one because it is light and it makes noise (which he loves), it also has the nubs molded in the plastic that massage his gums.The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it looks cheap, I wish they had done a better job of painting it."
4,Great research book by one of the masters.,John Stanaway has long been one of the experts on the P-38 and other WWII aircraft. This volume along with No. 19 should be in every P-38 nut's library. Pictures and drawings are great. For more about P-38 in the Pacific and McGuire check out a new book: THE LAST GREAT ACE.
2,NO BIG DEAL,"Comparing to other titles of this colection, this book could be much better. It lacks coehesion and sequence, contraty to the books written by John Deal and the best of this collection, ""HUrricane Aces"", by TOny Holmes (who, by the way, is the editor os this series."
4,Amazing background music for your cocktail parties!,"CD 1 is best, but CD 2 won't leave you disappointed.An absolute great purchase."
4,Excellent grown-up house!!,"I bought this CD on a whim at Border's - the guy said something like ""if you like house or progressive house, then you gotta check this out - it's the perfect house/chill/cocktail mix I've heard."" So I bought it - not dissapointed. CD1 is fantastic, a high energy, funky, jazzy, chill mix. CD2 is good, a bit more dubby and downbeat, but great nonetheless. Definitely a great CD to add to whatever discs you break out for parties. A disc where chicks look at you and say ""what the hell is this, it's great."" Picked up the 2nd in this series today, which is supposed to be even jazzier..."
4,Excellent Classy House & Classic House,Excellent compilation of House & Classic House tracks - very tasteful - one of the better sets within the BARGROOVES series.
3,"some interesting obscure songs, but lots of filler and songs that aren't even disco","This is a strange compilation. While I applaud anyone who brings more obscure tracks to market instead of simply reissuing the same music over and over, this compilation unfortunately is dominated by songs that deserved to be obscure when they were released -- in other words, they aren't very good. There are some good tracks hidden among the dreck here, though, such as Margo Thunder's cover of ""Expressway to Your Heart"" and the campy Brown Sugar track ""Lay Some Lovin' On Me."" It also has some other good, more familiar tracks from artists such as Minnie Riperton and Ashford & Simpson.What's most strange about this compilation is that a lot of the tracks aren't really even disco. Many of them are straight ahead r&b; tracks."
1,"Disco on ""E""","I'll defend disco's honor 'til the day I die, but like any underground ""overnight sensation,"" the market eventually takes notice and then does it to death. If you want to know what that death rattle sounds like, check out this needless two-disc collection. Chances are you've heard or heard of next to nothing on this set. There's a reason why. Lowest of the lows... Diana Ross's aerobics anthem ""Work that Body."" It answers the question ""Just how little can a star contribute to something and still stick her name on it?"" Sheesh!"
2,Dropping the ball!,"This version has lost a lot of it's visual pollish. We can only hope an update will fix some of the features that have been LOST since earlier versions. In '98 I could change the fonts used for registers! No more. My eyes hurt to look at it. But alas, I have 10 years of my life in there, I couldn't jump ship now."
2,Disappointingly Flawed,"After a month or so of use, I've found many conspicuous and a few not-so-conspicuous bugs in this version of Quicken which make it decidedly flawed relative to previous versions.First off, the installer doesn't work on UFS partitions, although you can install the software by just dragging the Quicken folder from the install CD onto your hard drive.Next problem is that Cmd-Q doesn't quit the application! It's hard to fathom, but true.Help won't open (maybe related to UFS and locating the help files). One of my transactions mysteriously un-reconciled and the re-reconcile function doesn't work. Trying to add a new subcategory crashes the application. You can't automatically pay credit card bills after reconciling. Etc.Oh, and it _still_ can't handle stock options in a reasonable way."
2,Not good for Fleet bank customers,"I had a very bad experience trying to get Quicken to import my downloaded bank data. After several failed attempts to use the Internet setup assistant in the program, I finally switched over to trying to manually configure my browser (IE 5.1 for OS X) to recognize Quicken as the proper application for the .qfx file once it's downloaded. It's necessary to go to Quicken help to find out how to do this, and even then, you have to watch Explorer closely during download to get the proper MIME type.After spending several hours trying to do this, the download finally triggered a launch of Quicken, and I was asked for a password. I tried all sorts of PIN numbers, account numbers, clearing out the PIN Vault, etc. No go. There's no hint on the Quicken or the Fleet site what to do about this, and I've logged way too much time on what should have been a simple import."
3,Very poor Carbonization,"I'm using Quicken on OS 10.1, and it's clear that Intuit did the minimum required to get it working on OS X. There are lots of UI bugs, and it just generally looks bad. It's also missing lots of features from the Windows version.On the postive side, there are some nice enhancements like the ability to sync your stocks to quicken.com. They've also got a PIN vault to store all your PINs, although I wish they'd used the Mac OS Keychain instead of inventing their own system.Quicken 2002 is the best financial software for the Macintosh, but is far worse than what you can find on Windows. I wish there was some good competition in this market on the Mac."
4,Upgrade experience,"I upgraded from the 2000 version with no trouble. The handling of regular bill payments is much better constructed. I am running the application under OS X and it runs very fast, and so far reliably. It seems to be a good piece of software."
1,Haven't received first issue yet,I wanted to reply but can't rate the item as I haven't received my first issue yet. (It made me put at least one star...)
5,"I order wrong book,, but end up liking it..","I had the book in mind, instead I purchase the workbook :-(,, It doesn't make sence due to the need of the video.. My mistake... I will be buying the actual video or book soo...."
5,Powerful,"I am going through a personal and hurtful situation my in life. I believe in GOD and I felt that I need to get closer to him to heal my pain and clear the chaos and drama going on in my life. I went to the bookstore and I came across this book. This book is heaven sent. I was so sad and in so much pain that after reading this book, I feel like I can do any thing. This book truly helped me. I wish she wrote more books other than the titles she already has on the market. I also like Joyce Meyers. This book is heaven sent. If you are in despair or want a better praying life, this is the book to get. I will read it again."
3,Not What I Thought,What I was looking for is a collection of prayers. This book does have various prayers and their focus is on guiding a seeker to a deeper prayer life from a committed conservative Christian guide.
2,Praying Woman lacking,"I am very disappointed in this study. Very little practical application in the daily lessons. I'm so used to Beth Moore ""talking to me"" every day in her lessons, this has been a bit disappointing. Lots of Bible verses, but tell me what I'm supposed to be getting from this."
3,Great for Stormie fans,Good study to help get you praying. Great for fans of the Power of the Praying... books.
2,What the...?,"I ordered ""Jinkers, Jivers and coke-fiends"" a collection of ""18 vintage songs and recieved the Rain CD-Single by the Guano Apes - nice job, guys!"
2,Just a note to Triq who reviewed this,It is the same beat as Sean Paul's get busy. And wayne wonder's no letting go. Anybody can decipher that.
1,Makes J. Lo sound like Aretha,"Lumidee - ""Never Leave You (Uh Ooh Uh Ooh)"" (Universal, 2003)To say that Lumidee can't sing is an understatement. Also, she uses the same beat that Sean Paul used in ""Get Busy"" and Wayne Wonder used in ""No Letting Go"". Unfortunately, this will be the biggest hit of the summer just like Khia's ""My Neck, My Back (Lick It)"" was last summer. -EJR"
2,It drops and drops until it breaks,"I guess I should have heeded the other reviews but I bought it anyway. That was in September and now, in early January, only 3 months later, after being stuck to a mirror and repeatedly falling off, over and over again, it has finally fallen one last time and shattered into many little [unsafe] pieces.There was nothing wrong with the mirror. It magnified just fine. But those 3 suction cups only hold for a brief period before losing their grip. And it doesn't matter if the surface they are stuck to is spotlessly clean and dry or moist or what. I tried it all.The cost is rather high since a person can find this same type mirror in a drugstore for half the price. And if the suction cups aren't going to work, who needs to pay this much?"
4,Zadro mirror,"Attached Zadro to wall extension mirror for really up close work. Love it - gets the job done. Good to travel with, as well."
1,Poor quality mirror,"First, the mirror is small. (That's ok, the size is mentioned, 3 1/2 inches.However, there's a lot of distortion with this lens, did not serve the purpose, I'll need to buy another one."
1,Useless,This mirror is so distorted it makes it essentially useless. I wouldbuy a mirror like this locally so you can see what you are getting...or in this case...not getting.
4,5th complete group album is on point,"My 2nd favorite of their complete group albums (not counting Havoc & Prode'je's albums) behind their classic ""All Day Everyday"" (I don't have their 1992, 2002, 2003, or 2005 albums). Packed with 17 songs (16 new ones) it has 2 I skip and 3 are ok, the other 12 are good or great songs. Guests are very few once again, on 3 of the songs. As usual the production is good and mostly done by Prode'je (he does 12 songs), Robert the Fonksta Bacon does 3 and Tomie Mundie does 2. Not much new on their lyrics but still a good album to have for fans who kick game with the SCC!#1 - 8 (upbeat song)#2 - 9 (good beat)#3 - 8#4 - 9 (good beat)#5 - 6.5#6 - 7.5#7 - 8.5 (f/ Kurupt)#8 - 6.5#9 - 8#10 - 9#11 - 7.5#12 - 7.5#13 - 8.5 (f/ Jayo Felony on the hook)#14 - 8.5 (f/ C-Bo, Spice 1, Prophet -- also on their ""Concrete Jungle Vol 1"" album)#15 - 8#16 - 8.5#17 - 8.5 (good vocals from L.V.)SCC is: Prode'je, Havoc, Havikk, L.V., DJ Kaos, DJ Gripp)check all my reviews"
4,looks Great !,"I would give this case 5 stars if the lid was attached insted of having to remove it every time you open the case, But, this would alow you to leave the case on a table and draw from if you listen to music frequently. Then put the lid on for storage. The case is very heavy with the Cd,s in it so It is not some thing you would like to take from the room you are using it in. Also there are no slots which means you have to mostly fill the case so the CD,s dont flop over. But , It looks very sharp and very durable ."
5,Another Winner from Wysong!,"Our pup really loves the beef flavored Au Jus, but also really likes this duck flavor. We use this to give her variety a couple times a week, but her main food isWysong Epigen 90 Dog and Cat Food Bag, 2-PoundandHolistic Select Small and Mini Breed Adult Health Dry Dog Food, 6-Pound Bag."
1,Not happpy,"The cans came very badly dented! Half of them were crushed on the top, and a couple were dented on the side."
3,Answering The Call To Write,"We are a freshmen English class in college who are using this book in our English 101 class. We haven't finished using the book yet, but so far it has been helpful in writing specific papers such as memoirs, profiles, and reviews. It gives examples of each of the genres of papers and then further gives specific information of what makes a good paper in that genre. It also suggests ways to go about writing one of these types of genres. One of the main focuses is on the revision process which is helpful because many people have trouble revising papers. The tone is easy to understand. We like that it is geared towards real world writing but we would have liked to see more creative writing tools such as poetry, fantasy, sci-fi, etc. We also would like to see broader examples like student essays that are easier for us to relate to. Overall, we think it's good for use in a classroom with a teacher but it would be difficult to learn from alone."
3,It's a Book...,"...About writing.The copy I received didn't look like the one pictured. It has a plain cover, and some pages look like they're photocopied. I'm okay with that though, because everyone in my classes says it looks like the ""indie version"". So that's cool. It's got everything I need for class, and I'm happy with it."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"The Abbott and Costello clips were decent as was the Laurel and Hardy clip ""The Flying Deuces"". However, the Laurel and Hardy ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" was so juvenile and boring that I only could tolerate watching a small portion of it. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis may have been funny 50 years ago, but Lewis' pratfall humor today is a bit much for me to stomach."
2,It broke....,"This food processor did not live up to my expectations for a Kitchen Aid appliance. The bowl and lid have numerous cracks, and the center spindle that the attachments fit onto broke at the base. So unfortunately, it's going out with the trash."
1,Eating Plastic,"I bought this because of the great reviews that I read here. I now wonder if some of those reviews were written by Kitchen Aid employees. This food processor sometimes does not chop all the food completely, some food tends to ride over the blades. The main blade has rubbed the bottom of the bowl and gouged out some of the plastic. When we use it to grate, the cutting disc rides up until the disc cuts the top portion of the bowl, dropping plasic chips into the food. The design of the grating discs (cutting discs) system is very poor.It only has one speed. This is a disadvantage. This will be our last Kitchen Aid."
1,"good motor , bad design","I bought this after reading reviews and a lot of research. The main problem with this food processor is the all purpose blade has rubbed the bottom of the bowl and scraped of some of the plastic. When I try to use the small bowl the small blade makes deep cuts on the bowl, makes it unusable. It does cut, chop the vegetables well."
1,KitchenAid FKP 670 Junk,"I wish I could agree with all the other glowing reports about the KFP670, but mine did not run long enough to find out what it would do. It ran for three minutes and quit, never to run again. So much for American made. Next time I will get a Cusinart."
5,Gotta love this!,"It juices oranges and limes in a second and totally impressed my house guests. The juicing was for their drinks so they were sober! I love the 3 bowls! I made a salsa in minutes as I chopped up the tomato, jalepenio, onion, garlic, cilantro and lime juice and wow how fresh and easy. It took 30 minutes out of my prep work. It looks pretty and I'm very proud of all of it's friends in the garage even though I've yet to figure out what they do! The appliance garage is also a great feature and one that I find fits perfectly in an oversized drawer that I have. What fun and how nice to know that if I feel like serving fresh squeezed oj to my sick child I can have it done in 2 minutes. And if I want to expand my horizons as a chef, well, I can do that to. Poo poo to the person who's blade was chopping up all sorts of stuff. You need to get a new one and experience what the rest of us call perfect kitchen aid meals. No, I'm not an employee. I'm a stay at home mom."
1,KitchenAid Made in France,"Just a quick note to let people know that KitchenAid is made in France. I saw France listed on Amazon's website as being the place of manufacture and called KitchenAid's customer service number to verify. To some people, it doesn't matter. But it does to me. While I understand KitchenAid is highly thought of, I will not purchase items made in France and feel people should know this little-known fact and make their own decision."
3,"Money, Blood, Guns..","Action, adventure, peanut butter! Pirates, mercenaries, explosions! A female character who has an unknown past and who happens to be super good with guns. Wait, this is starting to sound mundane and all too familiar. Is this a ripe off from Cowboy Bebop? Burst Angel without the mecha? A copy of Firefly without the space ships?Rokuro Okajima is a meek business salaryman from Japan who gets kidnapped when modern day pirates need something he carries. And suddenly he snaps, becomes a pirate and everything goes nuts. Did we forget to mention that the peace and security of the world is at stake? No? Well, don't worry about it because it never really turns up.If these anime had come out ten years ago it would have been a huge hit. Now it is just a after thought. It is OK and I may watch more of it. Or I may decide to spend that money on some else. Food, shoes, maybe a new book on pirates."
1,Do Not Buy! Priced or labeled wrong,This item is priced for a case but only one can ships. I ordered a case of the Chicken and Turkey canned food. The Chicken came as a case: 12 cans for $30. The Turkey came as one can for $30. I called Amazon and was repeatedly told that was the price of one can. This is obviously a mistake but no one seems able understand or fix it.
4,Good read,I enjoyed this book it was funny and sweet.It had the right amount of steam as well.A good read.
2,Really can't see how this is a romance,"I don't get this book as a romance. Nick explains several times how he would never be interested in Lucy. She says several times how Nick would never be interested in her. I kept reading hoping that the author would make this believable when they finally get together. She never did although I learned a lot about making chocolate.It's just no fun starting a book from the first knowing that the characters are so totally miss-matched!Even the secondary characters are boring. Her father, a brilliant surgeon who can't do anything in the real world. A cute cousin who needs her to tell him he is not gay. Her mom who no longer is interested in her brilliant husband the surgeon.Weird triangle between Nick's older brother & grandfather. The same story plays out with the older brother not marrying the mother of his child. Grandfather loses all respect. Nick doing the same thing with Lucy. Surely we can come up with something more original."
5,The best animated movie of all time!,"Mike Judge is a genius. Along with the two funniest animated teens of all time, he created quite a good story to go with it. I loved this movie, and I would recommend it to everyone (even if your parents say no!)"
3,THE TV SHOW WAS BETTER,"THIS BIG SCREEN ADAPTATION OF THE HIT ANIMATED MTV SERIES [WHICH I MISS DEARLY] HAS BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD GOING ON A CROSS COUNTRY TRIP AFTER THEIR TV SET IS STOLEN. FUNNY, BUT THE TV SHOW WAS EVEN FUNNIER AND MUCH SHORTER. HAS A LOT OF GUEST VOICES; SUCH AS BRUCE WILLIS, DAVID LETERMAN, CLORIS LEACHMAN, ROBERT STACK, AND MANY MORE. THIS SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD FOR ALL BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD FANS. HAS A REALLY GOOD MUSIC SOUNDTRACK, THOUGH."
5,Masterpiece about 2 lovable nitwits.,"OK, so the movie will probably be never be considered to be art...but it is VERY funny...one of my personal all-time favorites...This movie needs a sequel!"
3,Cornholio commands you,"I wasn't a fan of the tv show so wasn't expecting much from the movie, but its actually pretty funny. Beavis and Butthead get their tv stolen and go looking for a new one. Some lowlife mistakes them for hitmen and agrees to pay them $10,000 to 'do' his wife and of course they get the wrong idea. By the end of the movie, every FBI and ATF agent in the country are looking for them becaue they believe them to be criminal masterminds instead of the idiots they are.Robert Stack is hilarious as the ATF agent who orders cavity searches for just about everyone he meets and Cloris Leachman as an old lady who befriends Beavis and lets him take her medication and transforms him into 'Cornholio' which is the funniest part of the movie."
5,Very well done,I love to laugh and if you're a goofball like me you should own this. When I want to forget about what stresses me I put it on and get involved in this crime/drama/comedy.If you like B&B; you'll love this.
5,This is the funniest thing I ever saw...,"I am not a big fan of Beavis and Butt-head but as soon as I saw this cartoon, I like... fell in love with these two stupid losers. How they think is soo stupid. Beavis and Butt-head Do America is a must buy that will make you watch it at least 2 time minimum... uh -huh-huh-huh"
5,FULL CAVITY SEARCH ALL OVER AMERICA WITH BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD!!,"MAN! I remember when I first saw this movie in the 90's. Beavis and Butt-Head were HILARIOUS at the time and so this movie, but sometimes I wonder who were the REAL funny guys in this movie. Beavis and Butt-Head or the FBI?Well... I don't know who were the funniest but the film itself is full of harassment with the FBI and stupid moments with the retarded duo. It's a insane traveling adventure all over the US in search for a missing TV and a virus ""chip"". Both B&B; and the FBI do all kinds crazy stuffs in order to get what they want, but you know what they say: ""The end justifies the meanings"".If you like crazy/funny ""duo"" films like Wayne's World or Harold and Kumar then I recommend this one for you. I know that this movie is animated but give it a chance. It's old school 90's comedy at it's BEST!"
4,they belong to me at last.,"i was expecting a 10th anniversary edition but got a regular copy instead. love this movie. definitely one of the greatest. (to me). i wouldve given 5 stars if i got the anniversay edition like i asked, but even then the movies still good and at a pretty decent price. plus: shipping and handling."
3,good if you have a taste for laughing at stupid people,"This cartoon is for people who enjoy laughing at stupid people. If you cannot find stupid people funny, this movie is a waste of time for you. I don't like cartoons, but I laughed my butt off a few times during this movie, just because the characters are so dumb. And this is definitely not for kids."
1,dis could neva hapen n too many Commercials,i saw 50% dis movie on tv and it was mostly Commercials. most the Commercials had food in em so i went to barga king.
3,"Ok, but not great","I didn't much care for the plot and the detective character, but otherwise was an ok movie. get it to see more beavis and butthead antics...."
4,"RELEASE THE MOTHER FU*KING TV SERIES, YOU ASSES!!!!!!!!!!","I want the series you dumb ass creators. Beavis & Butthead is still the best show ever. However I hate the movie. It's funny in some ways. Mike Judge is hilarous. But King of the hill is my almost new favorite. Beavis & Butthead the MTV series was funny. I don't understand why the Season collections haven't been released.I am a really pissed off fan. Mike Judge is making crazy. Plus, Ebay selling 200 episodes on PC, which probably is illegal. I hope you DVD people & Mike Judge & MTV, have it in your heart to RELEASE THAT GREAT AMERICAN ASS MUTHA FU**ING TV SHOW. Now for the movie review:When BnBH'S tv is stolen, they decide to hunt for it & it's stupid ass adventure. I hate this damn movie.I ALSO RECCOMEND MARRIED WITH CHILDREN SEASON 2"
5,Bevis and Butthead Do America,"received it in A 1 condition...these are 2 funny dudes..if u love to laugh then buy this DVD..these dudes are so funny you wont ever get tired of watchin them... i use to watch them in the 80's use to be a tv series,it was funny as h*ll then and is still making me laugh today.."
5,Beavis and Butt-Head Do America,This is a great movie for any Beavis and Butt-Head fan. The humor is all there and celebrity voices that you may recognize.
4,Beavis and Butt-head is awesome!!!!,This movie is extremely funny!!!.....for anybody that likes to watch dumb people or stupid comedy...this is the movie for youIts a modern day three stoogesBeavis and butt-head redefine the meaning of boredom
5,Grips are great for wrist pain.,"I am a yoga teacher and a client I work with injured a wrist. He didn't want to stop doing sun salutations. We got him a set of the grip blocks. No wrist pain and he was able to do his sun sals.It changes a bit which muscles you use but if you get the nod from your doc or physical therapist, this will help you continue your practice if you're having wrist pain and help strengthen the supporting muscles."
5,Karen Carpenter is alive in her music,"I have been a fan of the Carperter's music since the early 70's and this release of their non-hits in Treasures is the reason why! I've always believed that the Carpenters best music never got radio time. ""Masquerade"" and ""I Can't Make Music"" are a testimony to the beauty and power of Karen's voice and to Richards geniuses at arrangement. This CD is worth the price. Karen is alive in her music."
3,Emma Related,I had a really hard time getting into this book. I'm not sure why. However that being said it may be more of someone else cup of tea.
4,"Well done, Joan Aiken","A lovely, plausible extension of Jane Austen's vision. It not only gives access to Jane Fairfax's motives and feelings, but dares to speculate on the forces which shaped Emma's character. My only wish might be that Frank Churchill is made to pay more painfully for his cavalier treatment of Jane, who too thoroughly exemplifies the feminine virtues of Austen's era, and is all forgiveness."
4,Austen lovers won't be disappointed...,"I read all the Jane Austen pre-quels, sequels, updates, etc. because I want to linger a little longer in the whole Austen world. With JANE FAIRFAX, I don't have to endure terrible writing and trite plots in order to revisit Highbury. Joan Aiken has written a delightful and insightful novel that stands very well on its own. I enjoyed the speculations into Jane's background, reasons behind her strained releationship with Emma Woodhouse, and events that lead to her engagement with Frank Churchill."
3,Anson's second novel doesn't disappoint.,"A house, possessed by an evil force that may be the devil itself, moves about the country, snaring people in its trap, forcing each new tenant into committing a similiar double murder. Can the house's newest owners break the spell before it's too late? It's a fairly nifty premise and author Jay Anson works very hard at building suspense and mystery with it. Some of the nightmare sequences and the ending, especially so, have stuck with me over the years. No classic but a book so well remembered is worth revisiting. Recommended."
3,hey now,"You can't really buy this book expecting a great literary experience. Just take it for what it is, a good way to kill some time. As a haunted house novel it stands, and the ending wasn'ttoo terrible. It was pretty light, but all in all i'd give it a stamp of approval."
4,good euro-trance!!,"if you like REAL trance from europe, then look no further. this cd is awesome. not as good as the previous ravermeister's (how could it be?!) but still very good. i live in australia, and it's real hard to find GOOD REAL trance. all i can find is the ""wild"" series, and things like nik skitz. if you like commercial dance/trance then don't get this cd. it's (mostly) awesome rare trance tunes."
4,A Tad Misleading,"When I read British Mod artefacts, I think freakbeat and such. Not so here. This 25 track comp features some of the best and quite unknown (to me, at least) British R&B bands from as early as 1963. This is not to say that it isn't a kick butt comp- IT IS. Great informative liners. Photos of the labels. Pictures of the bands. All around good stuff. The title is just a bit misleading to me."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is without a doubt one of the most disappointing cds I've purchased in a long time. I have never been able to develop an appreciation of the blues and that's all this is. I knew there were some more bluesy tunes on here, but to find even ex-Hollie Eric Haydock, the Shadows and others who are thought of more as Mod rockers doing flat-out blues was just more than I could take. If you're a fan of rock from that era - don't waste your money, find something else. If you like the blues, you should grab this immediately. That was what I had after listening to this - the blues because I wasted my money on it."
1,AC Blower,"Absolute junk! Tried three of them, they all sounded out of balance and definitely not throwing out air like the factory one. Go with the original one."
2,OK for price,Fan was smaller than factory but easy to install with a wired plug in but next time I would spend extra money and get factory blower motor. This one doesn't blow as hard as factory.
3,It's a blower.,"The blower is slightly easier to install and remove, due to a somewhat smaller squirrel cage than the original equipment. The squirrel cage is a bit out of balance, but is not very noticeable unless speed is at max. Seems to make a bit more noise than the original, but this may be due to transferred resonances caused by the unit being out of balance. The unit has a short pigtail to plug into, making connection a bit easier than the original equipment. Not a bad blower, but could benefit from more strict quality control."
1,Babe Ruth newsreel,"Too much repeated portions! Enjoyed the first segment, including the silents. WAY TOO MUCH REPEATED !"
1,The English language never stood a chance,"I sat down with Collectives and I gave it my best shot. I tried with everything I had but I just couldn't finish it. Collectives has to be one of the worst....... no THE WORST book I have ever read.Whether its the bad spelling, sentence fragments, or incoherent plots, Collectives is a very painful read. I don't like to knock authors work but books like this should never be published. A book like this could turn a person off to reading forever it is honestly that bad.To sum up avoid the book like the plague........ no wait, scratch that, go grab a copy. You have to read it for yourself to see just how bad it really is."
1,Painful,Like waking up on your birthday to see your new puppy crushed by a homeless man's shopping cart.
3,Interesting and entertaining.,"This book was an enjoyable read. Nikolaus has a distinctive style of writing that he shows off with flair and sophistication. The themes are deep and thought-provoking, and he employs good control of character and plot development to create excellent atmosphere.[...]Personally, from an unbiased standpoint, I would definitely recommend reading this book if you are a fan of the genre or poetry."
1,He's never been any good,"I have known this persons writing for years. If his writing matched his opinion of himself he would be the greatest writer living or dead.I thought it might be my personal dislike that tainted my view of his writing, so I showed samples of his work to others.After a few paragraphs I was generally asked, was this written by a 12 year old?"
1,Best book I have ever read,"This is the first book Nickolaus has had published and I sure hope it isn't the last! He has truly created a classic in the annals of Gothic and Horror literature. Following in the footsteps of great horror writers like Blackwood, Poe, Lovecraft, King, Poe, London, Irving and of course Edgar Allan Poe, this collection of short stories features the same things that made these writers so great - Africanized bees. Any book with Africanized bees is bound to be a classic. He perfectly captures Lovecraft's style, if Lovecraft were a untalented Cuban immigrant with a very tenuous grip on the English language. In short, ignore the naysayers whose opinions are influenced by Nickolaus' lack of talent and inept prose and BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Nightmarish,in so much that Pacione considers himself a writer. Coherent? Not in the least. Frightening? Only if you're a teacher. Before you can break the rules of grammar you must first UNDERSTAND the rules of grammar. And he has shown that he doesn't. To compare him to Poe and Lovecraft is a giant slap in the face of those two men.
1,TERRIBLE HAS A NEW TITLE,One of the worst books I have ever read. Almost as bad as the works of Terry Lloyd Vinson and Barbara Malenky.
1,MY EYES!,"The violations of even the most clear grammatical rules of the English language will leave the reader stabbing pencils into his eyes.An attempt that should prove, once and for all, that not all efforts are rewarded or worth repeating, and that not everyone should be a writer or editor. Some peoples' work is better left unshared with the world. This piece tops that list."
2,"If Audio Is Easy, Then Why The Need For A Book ???","As A Sound Engineer And Certified Pro Tools Operator With A College Degree, I Laugh At The Title...Nobody Can Do Anything Without Trying...This Book Is Good For The Beginner, Or Those Getting Their Feet Wet, But Don't Fool Yourself, One Can't Simply Beleive They'll Become A Great Engineer Just By Reading A Book...A Great Introduction To Pro Audio With Some Fun Parrallels, But Not As In-Depth As Some Would Like..."
2,"Good, but not what I wanted","This is a very good book if you're into engineering for larger audiences (halls, etc). I was looking for a car audio related book, but I did keep it since one day it may indeed come in handy."
1,Wrong Approach for Beginners,"It seems that ""made easy"" in the title refers to how brief and shallow the author has covered much of the topics in this book. There are a few gems but not enough to justify using it to teach beginners about sound systems. The author also bumps into some very technical topics after just a few pages of introduction (which has too much tongue-in-cheek humor).Need I say it- I was disappointed!"
4,A names and dates history,"This is a useful addition to a bookshelf as well as a quick read over the complex history of Ireland. If you want to quickly place the ""Wild Geese"" or Wolf Tone or Cromwell in a historical context it will prove an invaluable tool. Furthermore, the prose is readable and not bogged down with a mass of professional notes. I think that's the key, information is presented in the style and detail of the professional historian but without all the scholarly apparatus. The scholar ,seeking proper reference or in depth character and motivation, must look elsewhere. Be advised that there is weighting toward the nineteenth and twentieth century. There is some discussion of the famine and emigration, but only as part of the historical progression. For that and diaspora study The Great Shame is a better bet. Would I buy this book again? Yes. Why? it is a valuable reference tool. Does it captivate me as some histories do? No. Best advice I can give: decide why you might want it."
1,Kathy Smith is not a belly dancer,"If you want to learn belly dance, then take classes from someone who knows what they're doing. Don't buy a video from someone who has taken a few lessons and doesn't know how to dance. I'm sure her knowledge of fitness and exercise is fine. Kathy Smith just isn't a dancer. Even at the low-low price of $9.98, this video is over-priced. In my opinion."
3,Kathy Smith - Flex Appeal,"If I was rating this dvd based solely on Kathy Smith's bellydance ability I would have given it one star. Ms. Smith is barely capable of executing the many of the movements she teaches, which I feel is irresponsible. I gave the dvd three stars instead, based on the overall workout value and that being able to watch Ansuya and the other dancers executing the movements behind Kathy somewhat redeems the dvd.I actually do enjoy doing the workout routines, so I would recommend the dvd .. but, would do so with a cautionary word on Kathy Smith's bellydance ability .. or, lack of it."
4,"Kathy is not a dancer, but it is still good!","I bought the video and now I am going to buy the DVD since I no longer have VHS. I thought the video was great, I just had superficial problems with it. For example, Kathy's top isn't tight enough to see her arm movements, but that is okay because we can see the other dancers movements nicely. Now, this is a beginners/intermediate workout so don't expect to be burnt out unless you don't exercise regulrarly. Also, the other dancers don't have rock hard bodies or a model bodies. I thought it was better then the Veena and Nina and Rana videos. I also enjoyed te music and the stage setting."
4,good workout,"I believe this is still a good workout even thought KS is not a bellydancer. I got this video when it first came out and use it when I am low on time, it is broken down into two twenty minute workouts. Also the 10 minute stretch at the end is very nice."
3,"Good, but not great...","I was looking at Bellydance videos, and this one came up, I read the reviews, and would have been a little put off, if I hadn't bought Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss: Pure Sweat, before reading the reviews. The reviews for that one were horrible, but I liked it, so I took a chance and bought this one. I really enjoyed it. The set is beautiful, and so are the costumes in the Heat It Up section. It wasn't the best workout video I've ever done, but it was fun, and I worked up a decent sweat.*EDIT*I just wanted to add that I absolutely love the cool down. You stretch out and just feel peaceful after. Just follow the voice, and not Kathy on the screen, because they are sometimes out of sync. I only rewind to the start of the cool down, so I can do it after other exercise tapes aswell."
3,Good Basics,I thought this video interesting. My Mom told me Kathy Smith tends to Prostitute herself with whatever the latest fad is and I find it true in this video. I have a hard time following Kathy in this video her body type is interesting and doesn't seem to show off the moves quite so well. I find myself watching the girl in the back more than I do her. Its good for basics and it does give you quite a workout if that is what you are looking for but I would rather get a video from a professional belly dancer. I would have actually liked to get a video from the girl in the back and who does the dance solo she's amazing!So if you are looking for just basic basic workout and belly dance instruction this is a good start. If you get it watch the girl in the back on some moves and not Kathy!
4,LOVE Kathy but only LIKE this video,"I own alot of Kathy Smith's workout tapes- She is definitely one of the best fitness instructors out there!! However, don't be fooled just because it is Kathy Smith that you will get a good cardio workout - if you are intermediate or advanced you probably won't break a sweat. This tape is FUN if you are a beginner to exercise or if you just want to learn something new. It's also good for those 'off days' when you know you should exercise but aren't feeling quite up to a strenous workout.Some advice: Wear a sash/scarf or something around your waist -you might feel silly but it DOES help with the hip movementsNote that even though the dancers are barefoot, I found that I needed the extra ankle support of my crosstrainers."
2,So Sad,"It is so sad to see someone try so hard to make a good video where they can't even dance. I dont know what she was thinking, but someone should have told her that she looked ridiculous trying to teach what she does not know. She is crazy for having her Belly Dance Instructor as a background dancer, what was she thinking?? Gosh, the whole time the background dancers out-danced her. LOL, I saw her Merenge-Salsa video, and its the same shame. I am a professional Latin Dancer, born into the dance, and honestly she does need to stick to what she knows. She is so stiff,its funny to watch her dance. Get this DVD for a workout only, believe me even if you are a beginner I am sure you'll out-dance her too."
5,Great Belly Dance Workout,"I've been interested in the art of Belly Dance for years, and have purchased many books and videos on the subject. Books are no good in learning dance moves because you can't see the action. DVDs are great because you can mirror and pause and rewind until you get the moves right. Most of the other videos I've watched are too long and repetitive. Kathy Smith creates two workouts which spend just enough time on each move before changing to another. The sets and costuming are great, as is the sound quality. I really enjoy doing this workout and feel wonderful afterwards!"
4,"I'm Sorry, but I Like It!","Man, a lot of people are mad at Kathy Smith for trying something new! I like this video. To me, it is one of the funnest, well-produced Bellydance videos on the market. I've tried the ones with the twins (too repetitive) and Rania (not my fave instructor, blah) and got bored. I like the costumes, music and sets of this video. Sure, Kathy may be a little more stiff than the professional belly dancers, but that shouldn't surprise anyone. I thought she still did a pretty good job! Plus, there are plenty of opportunities to watch the dancers in back of her to develop different styles of the moves. This video has a 20-minute warmup that teaches the moves, then a 20-minute routine to use them in a workout, a 10-minute stretching routine, and a bonus 3-minute dance to learn on your own. My one complaint is that I don't feel like I've worked out after completing this video, so it's best for a lighter day. Bottom line: Good intro to belly dance video."
1,All other belydance videos are better than this,"I love to workout with videos and this past year tried bellydance videos, which has become my new hobby. There are many bellydance videos available on Amazon.com and this is by far the worst. There are bellydance workout videos by the twins, instructional bellydance videos by Jillina and The Goddess Workout by DOlphina which is a little of both and I would highly recommend all of these! These videos are done by professional bellydancers that have danced their entire lives perfecting the art. Bellydance is a great workout, but it is so much more than that and not something you can learn in 2 days and instruct other people. Kathy Smith is stiff, unsexy and uninspiring and unmotivational. If this is the only video I saw, I would not be inspired to bellydance. Though she does have an ""expert"" on the set, Kathy is still the instructor and she doesn't have what it takes to teach this bellydance video. Try any other video, really!"
4,Good introduction to belly dance,"This is a very good beginner's level workout. Surely Kathy is stiff and not so good at belly dancing, but the other dancers are pretty good, and their outfits are a pleasure to look at. This workout covered quite a few classic moves of belly dance, and the whole workout is very well structured, keeps you move and having fun and feeling feminine and pretty at the same time."
5,a unique journey,"The radio release of ""Widow"" made me curious. How could such a un-rock-like song end up on a mainstream rock station? (Needless to say, it was not played often.) I purchased the CD with no idea of what to expect. What I found was a mesmerizing, operatic dream. The CD jacket lists 15 tracks, but several tracks are strung together to draw you into a few epic journeys. These journeys are turbulent and moody.I'm really not sure why, but I loved this CD from the first time I listened to it. I was encouraged to buy the debut CD from The Mars Volta: De-Loused in the Comatorium. It too is hypnotic.If you want mainstream rock, don't buy this CD. If you have a curious and open mind, you need to listen to this."
5,"Love it or hate it, but I love it!","I am a big fan of Cedric Bixler Zavala and Omar a Roriguez-Lopez. I think they are both brilliant in what they do. The whole point of their music is expression and emotion through music. I'm happy that they try new things on every album because i hate musicians who try to copy their sound over and over again.The Mars Volta is evolving into a powerhouse almost equal to ATDI. I love it. The jazz/funk/punk/rock/latin vibe that it pulls off. You can tell that they put all their effort into this album and that they were not just trying to put out another record(sparta). Even if you do not like this type of music or it went into a direction that you disagree with, you have to have respect for this band and this album. I mean come on, ATDI! And who said that a song had to be 5 mins or less. Open your mind, their is no restrictions when it comes to music unless your a nazi."
4,good cd but too much...,i love this cd. dont get me wrong its a great cd but they should have more lyrics. the one thing i will critisize is the widow. best song on the album and than 3 minutes in they just play statiky mucis. great cd i still recommend it alot and love it
2,"A watered down ""Mr Bungle""","This album isn't really that bad, but it's not very good either. I have two main problems with it that ruin it.1. The singer. Put the Led Zeppelin, Rush, and U2 singer in a blender and it's not a good sound.2. It's sounds like Mr Bungle but not nearly as good. I have only made it through this album once and every other time I stop at track three because it sounds like Mr Bungle but not nearly as good. It's almost like these guys took everything good about Mr Bungle and combined it with generic 70's rock. I also doubt that The Mars Volta has many fans who have actually heard Mr Bungle.The bottom line is why would I listen to this when I could listen to Mr Bungle which is better in every single way? They also have a much better singer."
1,Overrated,"I really don't see what's so great about this band. The guitarist is the only decent part of the band. The singer pisses me off especially. His voice is annoying. I wasn't sure what I was hearing when I heard his ""voice"", and his lyrics are downright awful. Sometimes it seems like he just grabbed random sentences and tossed them together. The other 2 members are nothing special either. This is proof that salsa and progressive punk don't fit together at all. If you want good progressive rock, listen to King Crimson or Pink Floyd. Avoid this overrated garbage."
3,okay but not great... buy De-Loused in the Comatorium instead,"this album is solid but maybe since i owned De-Loused in the Comatorium first the expectations were set too high, as that album is one of my all-time favorites. in comparison to De-Loused, this album is a little rawer, a little darker on the whole (musically and lyrically), and a little less energetic (on the whole). i would classify both as a latino-fused progressive alternative rock (from the planet yerbadoxi - exxxxxcellent).in both albums omar brings the orchestrated madness which is known for and it is truly unique, interesting, and worth listening to... especially for musicians looking to explore new territories. ditto for his lyrics, spliced between spanish / english, and replete with disparate analogies which are quite amazing and inspiring."
4,Not as good as Deloused,"After falling in love with Deloused in the Comatarium, I decided to embark on Frances the Mute, expecting the sameness. But Frances the Mute is so much more complex and overwhelmingly long compared to Deloused. I have listened to Frances many times and it is kind of losing interest. Even though I absolutely love TMV, I think they couldve done a better job here, maybe if they were high it couldve been more enjoyable. There are just too many long periods of nothingness, some are unique and neccessary, but they couldve cut it down a little bit. This album definately isnt for everyone, you need to listen to this many times to truly get anything out of it. I suggest anyone new to TMV to buy Deloused instead or before you buy this CD to get a good feel of how TMV's music is.I do like how Flea plays the trumpet on here though, a very unique addition to the album."
5,Mind Blowing,"This album is absolutley amazing. Like Deloused, it takes a while to digest. After about the 10th listen, I truly believe that this album is better than the last.I'm a straight-up hip-hop head, but this is the best album in the last few years.You need to buy this."
1,"An amazing song, on an AWFUL album","I dont care what everyone else wants to call it, this cd is crap. Im pissed i didnt use my money for a better cd. I guess it would not be so frustrating if they hadn't of done such a good job with widow. But the rest of the cd is horrible.I dont understand how people can classify this as music when im sitting here, listening to over 4 minutes of erie tones. I think it would be wiser, less costly, and just as ""intriguing"" to buy the song on iTunes, and go buy a halloween cd with the erie tones on it. Overall, i just wish i could get my damn money back!My GradeF"
5,the greatest album ever to be made in mankind...,i woke up at 5 in the morning waiting for the store to open so i could buy this cd. also i took the whole day off from school and work just to listen to this album all day with my friends.cyngusgemini
1,Prog Rock is back,This is pretty awful. Perhaps if you think Pink Floyd's Animals is a great album you might like this. It is a mish mash of different songs in thrown together to make one song. Not like a blend of different styles. No they play one song like let's say it sound like Queen and then the same song goes to a mellow mexican type song. Then back to the Queen song then back to the mellow mexican style song. Perhaps if you were taking a lot of drugs this might be clever but to me it has the value of a 30 minute drum solo.
4,First Try,"Seeing as how this is the first MV record I've bought, I was amazed. They played styles I never could have even imagined. Though they played so many, it always sounded like the same band, which is a virtue in the music business these days. It seems like most bands take so much advantage voice effects and conformity that every song sounds like a different band, but with the same music. Are bands like TMV the new face of prog? Well whatever they are, this is a great record. Next time though, a little less dead air and a bit more music? Cool."
5,Greatest 77 minutes of music & sound EVER,I don't know what some of the reviews are talking about because this album is friggin' GENIUS. It's absolutely ridiculous how intelligent these guys are to create this music. No one can do that? They are the new Pink Floyd/ Led Zeppelin of our day. The guitar work is so crazy but good. They just invented a whole new type of musical composition. Pretty damn original if you ask me. It is truly an orgasm to the hears. 10 stars!!!!!
2,Crap,"Isn't it sad when noise passes for quality music? Well that's what a decent chunk of this album is. And when there is actual music it is still nothing special. These guys undoubtedly have talent, but unfortunately they've barely shown it on this. I don't hear what the big fuss is about."
2,Not really that great.,"This album is mediocre... I don't see myself listening to it very much in the future. The old album was much better because it had actual music on it while this one... doesn't.But hey if you want long drawn out periods of build up (like 3 minutes or so in each song) or if you'd like a bunch of artistic noises (another 3 minutes in each song)... ""Hey wait... that leaves hardly any music at all in the album... That is like half of every song! Wtf!"" Yeah thats what you will be saying when you realize you just payed money for some fool to hit random keys on his electric keyboard.Well if you ARE a mars volta fan then buy this album (but expect to be dissapointed)-- otherwise don't give it the time of day unless you are majoring in art.My suggestion is to go out and buy a Blood Brothers album instead of this. Preferably ""Burn Piano Island Burn"" or ""Crimes."" Seriously-- they are like 100x better than The Mars Volta."
3,Not quite up to par...,"First song: awesome. Second song: great. Third song: very interesting! But the rest of it, which is most of it time-wise, just isn't very exciting. Sounds like they're wasting a lot of time and space with lengthy outros and relatively boring riffs.Where is the incredibly tight groove that we heard in Deloused In The Comatorium? There is a little bit of it in the first track of Frances The Mute, but to me, this album sounds largely improvisatory and thrown-together."
4,musicians from mars,"Put together Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew"", Led Zeppelin's ""II"" and ""III"", and King Crimson's ""In The Court of King Crimson"", and you get ""Frances The Mute"". My favorite Mars Volta album so far, but all of them are amazing. Could be very very strange for listeners who never listened to this kind of music. To me, this album resembles ""Bitchs Brew"" alot (not just in the music itself, but the way it was received by the public - you either hate it or love it)."
2,"Rock, hold the prog","While De-loused in the Comatorium was an awesome prog-rock album, Frances the Mute is a little to prog for my tastes. It still has some great parts but there are more portions that I would rather fast forward through (I've had enough of distorted spoken word).The track list on Amazon is incorrect. Here's the track list for my CD:1. Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus2. The Widow3. L'Via l'Viaquez4. Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore5-11. Cassandra GeminiI'm not sure why the last song needs seven tracks, but it does."
5,SICK,"This is the album we all knew one day would come, and that day is today. At The Drive In is finished, and it took this cd for Mars Volta to really explode into their own personality. This cd is a concept cd about a diary they found in a car a year back - listen to the lyrics and you will understand. It is progressive yet catchy in the style that the great progressive artists (pink floyd, etc) can only do. I highly recommend."
4,Found on Accident,"Watching MTV, I saw the video for The Widow playing, while the TV was on mute...as it often is when MTV is on... But I saw the creativity in the vid and thought, I must hear this song... and that is indeed the way I feel about it, I must hear more! I am pleased with what I have heard from them. I tend to like non-mainstream music, the stuff that no one else is listening to, but I am aware that if MTV is playing it, all the ""cool kids"" will be listening to it too! OH well, I am not a cool kid I am a grown folk and I like this music, its very artistic and makes me think of a ""gumbo""; has everything in it with a lot of flavor, a bit of spice and some surprises. I must say, that for ONE second...only one, when I heard the voice, I thought that there was some ""unrealesed"" Zepp flying around out there. Rock on Guys! Sounds GREAT!"
2,"Noise, noise, and racket","The widow, does not fit in this album. The rest of it is a bunch of noise with some lyrics thrown in there. I do not recommend buying this, get their other album. It's better. This one is disappointing."
2,What?,"Thats what I ask myself most of the time when I'm listening to this. I loved De-Loused in the Comatorium, that album was crazy but at least it had ""songs"" on it. This is just space junk and spooky sound effects with a few ""song"" moments floating around somewhere within.Whats worse is the cd jacket is totally misleading as to how the tracks on the album are broken down. Most of the time I just sit here asking myself what the hell is going on.This album is so overrated. Yes, the orignality is there, but the endless jamming and weird effects that last forever really detract from the album. Make sure you keep your finger glued the ""forward"" button on your cd player because you are going to find yourself skipping through minutes of useless noise to get to the good parts."
1,a drum lesson,"People desperately want there to be a resurgence of epic rock music and for that reason are calling this terrible album a masterpiece. It feels like a bunch of disjointed riffs and sound effect noodling thrown together with terrible guitar solos by in between. Jamming with this guitarist must be the most frustrating thing in the universe but you'll appreciate that after listening to this because the whole album is basically a jam session that features an incredible drummer but otherwise musicians who are trying to be something they are not. In fact the drums are the most prominent instrument on this album. 5 stars for the drummer, 1 star for the insipid lyrics and non musical garbage of the rest of the album."
2,The Formula,"A few good songs here and there. But it's way too hard to get past the pretensiousness.The formula: read Edgar Allen Poe, experiment with drugs (or even better get hooked), and get that fabulous herion shek look. Then listen King Crimson, Yes, and various punk bands. Then take any idea that pops to mind like it is the greatest insight ever and everyone else is too stupid to figure out; then voala- you have something totally pretentious and abnoxious.Some folks will write reviews about how this music has the mark of genius! Then you'll believe your hype so much that you will make albums that get worse and worse but it will be masked by with obsurd explainations of how its over everyones heads.This is a talented band that needs to edit their songs and stop emualating old ones."
2,Anything but cohesive,"Two stars because their ability to attract so much attention.I tried, really I did. I feel like I'm all at once trying to listen to the radio, read a book, study, have a conversation, crank a movie, and deal with an argument going on in the next room. I just don't get it. I thought music was supposed to be melodic."
2,Personal Opinion,"YOu might like this CD if your very partial to expiremental music, but it bored the crap out me. I expected more, but they probably figured they only need a couple good songs and the rest can be ""oh it'd be crazy if we sample the sound of a bus for 4 minutes!"""
1,mars is not far enough away,"ok first I got this cd because I read the review in the usa todaypaper and they said it was good, they also said another cd that I got was good also, both are not good, but this Mars cd is just bad, its terrible I listened to it once already and it is without a doubt the worst cd I have gotten this yr and the worst I have gotten ever. Its mixing of it is bad, it sounds like they just put on the mixer and put the bass and drums and everything else and just put it together, theres no sound that you can connect to and its very hard to follow the music, its all over the place fast , slow, theres no way to get into the music because its just that bad to listen to, IM sorry but this is bad, I cant say it any other way except the only good thing about this cd is I paided 7.99 for it which is about 7.00 to much, dont get it thats all I can say,"
1,Hideous.,"If it were possible to give an album negative stars, I can think of none more deserving than this one. All 76 minutes is completely unlistenable dreck. I don't think its possible to make it through the entire album."
1,interesting music,I enjoyed this album and even went see them in concert - they were the opening act for Red Hot Chili Peppers - trust me stick to the albums my ears were bleeding by the time they finished playing.
1,Worst Rock Music EVER!,I am baffeled by the belief that this is music. I just don't get it. This is the WORST music and concert that I have ever ever ever ever heard.
5,An awesome epic,"This album is amazing!! And how's about that whole EP 5 track debacle that they had. I reckon splitting up Cassandra Geminni was a good idea because that also stops music piracy cos you wouldn't be able to download that song in it's 32:32 entirety. And as far as I know, there aren't any programs out there that can perfectly splice tracks together, but then again, I could be wrong.What a kick ass album! I love L'via L'viaquez, I reckon that's the best track on the album. Cygnus, Widow and Miranda were also wicked but I was very impressed with Cassandra Geminni. Surely one would think that if you were going to do a 32+ minute song, there would be some slack instrumentalism or something like that in there just to keep the time ticking over. But not once did that colossus of a song lose it's edge! That easily makes The Mars Volta one of today's greatest bands!You guys kick ass! Come back to Australia!"
2,Some bands just need a good producer.,"Omar's excesses need reigning in, or he just goes off on meaningless tangents. It's like Morrissey in The Smiths, with Johnny Marr to keep him in line (great), and Morrissey left to his own angst-ridden excesses (self-indulgent, meandering and very uneven). Rick Rubin--the great producer who did the solo Johnny Cash records--kept ""De-loused"" on track and made every minute count. I'm afraid this record has gone the way of solo Morrissey records: self-indulgent, meandering and very uneven. 'Tis a pity. Some people's egos just demand that they have a producer to keep them on track. This band is a good example."
5,I've never had another album grow on me like this one! Frances the Mute is terrifically unique!!!,"I enjoyed this CD the first time I listened to it, however, I didn't really appreciate how great this CD was until I'd listened to it several times. I've never had another album grow on me like this one did. However, be cautious; The CD is made up of several increadibly catchy tracks, however, the tracks all build into one another in a Pink Floydesque fashion. Therefore, this is the type of CD that should be played front to back in order to understand how terriffic it is. If you prefer prototypical CD formats (by which I mean several 3 minute songs which can be played in any order), this may not be the CD for you. The CD demonstrates very catchy guitar and lyrics and great psychadellic electronics, which I typically tend to dislike. Frances the Mute also demonstrates a very unique sound which I cannot compare to any other albums. A great addition to anyone's collection."
4,Definitely different,"I am not a big fan of this type of music. As a matter of fact there is really no classification for these guys. Emo, prog, punk,....what are they??? i would have to say that have formed a new genre of music that I call ""creative sci-fi"". lol. The Mars Volta is a great band. This album is not as good as ""deloused"" which is their best album yet, but it is defintely worth listening to if you're tired of hearing the same type of music on the radio everyday. It's like the art of Tool, the voice and emotion of Queen, the creativity of Pink Floyd, great musicians, and the ""start of an era"" history of Led Lepplin have all combined into one band. I am not a big fan of track 3 though because I am not really into spanish music. But that song does have a funky ass cool bass line! That bass line is low and groovy. If you are not a big fan of mars volta then I suggest you buy ""Deloused..."" before this album. It's a better introduction to their creativity."
5,WOW,This CD is one of the best ive ever heard!! it blows DITC out of the water. Its wierder more musical and just cooler. 5 songs streched over 77 minutes and the last one over a half hour its heavy listing but well worth it
4,See Francis live!,"I am an enormous Volta fan, but I would say that I tend to prefer the compact power of Deloused over the more spacious and electic Francis. Francis is very, very good album, while I think Deloused is a truly GREAT album.One caveat on this, however: See them live. I recently saw the Volta live (for the second time) and I can say that in concert the Francis material was absolutely stunning and mind-blowing--every bit as good as the Deloused material. Even though they are perhaps the heaviest, most convincing live sound I've ever heard, I was still caught off guard at how good the Francis material was. Perhaps a bit of the material's intensity got lost in album production (Rick Rubin produced Deloused but not Francis and my sense is that he reigned them in and fattened up the sound a bit). Whatever the case, after hearing the songs live Francis has a whole new power!"
2,pretentious masterbation,"yes, we know how good they are at guitar and we know that they are latino. if only they haddnt abandoned the brilliant song structes they created with ATDI and the overall fluidity that they once possesed, this album might be credible. if you want to hear wailing guitars, get a stevie ray vauhn album, and if you want to hear progresive music, listen to Yes. if you want to beleive that the mars volta are doing something new and extremely impressive, get stoned and lsiten to their album while sniffing rails off of the cd cover. otherwise, its just an albums worth of guitar masterbation and fake words."
5,no...its not noodling..,"Most of the complaints on here are legitimate. They should have cut the songs at certain points and been done with them. The problem with these complaints ,however, is that they fail to understand the perspective Mars Volta is coming from. Or maybe they understand the perspective but would really prefer not to take a trip with the band. People...all of these tracks were most likely written under the influence of a some really bad drugs. Most likely acid. The same people who hate ""Frances the Mute"" probably are the same people who criticize ""Natural Born Killers"" or ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" for being too weird. They just don't understand. You don't need to be under the influence to understand ""Frances the Mute."" You just need to understand that some really classic bands out there wrote some really good albums while seeeeeeeriously high. This is one of them."
5,Awsome!!!!!!,"Hey I'm 13, because why else would i be here. I love this album. This is the kind of album i look for when i want a cd. It makes you think, makes you feel, makes you question the direction of your life. At least thats how i felt after smoking and listening to this cd. Well regarless of my level of intoxication i love this cd!!!!!"
2,Sadly dissapointing,"I wasn't expecting TMV to top ""De-Loused..."" since, in my opinion, that album is pure genius. But even with my realistic expectations, I was definitely dissapointed with ""Frances..."". Whether or not anyone wants to admit it...""Deloused..."" has ""hooks"" in their songs. Combining that fact with their incredible skills(especially the drummer, damn he's good!) and creativity, it made for a mind-blowing album. ""Frances..."" has no hooks. It's completely boring. Not to mention there is way too much filler such as bird sounds that seem to last forever. I can't help but think that this is a result of not having someone like Rick Rubin(producer of De-loused) there to tighten the reigns and give some valuable input into their song writing.Plain and simple...I just can't get into any of these songs no matter how many times I listen to it. ""De-loused..."" is a masterpiece and I can only hope that TMV get's back on track to writing quality material again."
3,Vague latin is the echo analog rock,"I'm a total proponent of enabling the listener to personally tailor lyrics, but Bixler's ""poetry"" makes absolutely no sense to me (he can really belt it out though).For someone who claims no knowledge of music theory, I'm somewhat impressed with Omar's compositions as a whole. If the claim is true, he's obviously gleaned a lot over the past decade playing with all those bands/projects (there is hope for the rest of us).However, while there are some interesting musical moments, there's are also way too much blatant effects garbage. Tweaking the analog echo effect knobs takes no skill...and it sounds like it (2 minute spans of this are not ""contrast"" but overkill to say the least). This filler and other awkward moments probably would have been ""discouraged"" if Rick Rubin would have stayed on as producer, possibly making FTM as good as De-loused (both of which end up a background music genre for me).I'm much more of a Sparta kind of guy. More rock, less BS."
2,eh????? what the hell is going on,hmmm. what can i say about the new album expect its virtually impossible to lsiten all the way through. while DE-Loused was considerably long the song strcutures pretty focused and werent as meandering as the follow up. The album is pratcially one 77 minute drugged out jam that is diificult to listen to. It does though have handful spralling and engaging moments but that is usually neglected by long periods of silence or pshydellica tweaks thats makes this 77 minute effort seem like 3 hours. decent in its own right but ntohing reaches the catharatic and grooving heights of DE-Loused.underwhelming
5,Fun AND informative,"This is a really enjoyable read and full of ideas. Sam is a great motivator and public speaker. If you know she's going to be in your area, sign up to see her! She's great at personally reframing negative ideas for you and making them into positive affirmations."
5,Inspirational and Refreshing,What I learned from this book opened my eyes to all the little things we do in our own lives that not only complicate but also hold back our progress. I was so amazed by the third chapter that I couldn't wait to finish and lend it out to my close friends. By about mid way through I realized that this was a book I would not be willing to let go of. I realized that this book was one that I needed to put somewhere accessible so I would be able to come back to it at least once a year and reread. I have now bought 6 copies and have distributed them to some of my closest friends and family. This book has been such an inspiration as well as breathe of fresh air that I feel everyone should have a copy of their own.....which is why I'm sure I won't stop at 6. This book has helped me so much and in turn helped the people around me.
3,Confidence 101,"There are a lot of good suggestions in this book if you haven't read others like Dale Carnegie's How to Develop Self-Confidence. Its fundamental, no new insights here."
4,Sam Horn hits the mark,great book! Examples are great! Unknown issues being handled in addition to the known ones.
5,nice transaction,"The book was packaged with care, and I could tell they truly look out for their customers. I would definitely buy again from them!"
3,Not too bad......,"Production is not good, Drums too low, Guitars sometimes too high and not in a good way. But Zody as always is right on. OK songs, Good playing, But for the hardcore fan only. Some people say this CD is whimpy, I don't think so, You like the songs but just wish they had put more effort into recording.. Sounds like a weekend warrior demo.. But still; Their worst stuff is still better than most best. I'm just happy that their still making music and Zody's still a pervert with a golden heart...."
4,"Fast, Funny Read","This book is lots of fun. It has elements similar to The Devil Wears Prada--but the evil boss here is more complex. The mystery within the book is pretty compelling--although I could have done with less of the actual book within a book text.All in all, a very good, fast read. I look forward to reading the author's next novel."
1,Had to put it down!,"After sticking with this really silly novel because I was travelling and had no other English fiction on hand, I finally gave it up at about page 150. It was just too uninteresting, with no one to like and a protagonist who was mostly remarkable for spinelessness. Left the thing in a closet in a hotel in Baku!"
5,Intelligent and funny,"Having read Debra Ginsberg's memoirs, I anticipated her first novel to be everything I have come to expect of her - funny, sensitive and intelligent. And I wasn't disappointed. I loved this book for the send-up of the publishing industry - of which I know very little. But, most importantly, I appreciated the heroine being a strong and intelligent young woman and not a ditzy doormat. The story moves along briskly as the suspense builds up and the denouement is deliciously satisfying. This book is a wonderful read."
5,I Loved This Book!,"From the very first chapter, when the author was describing her love of books, I was hooked on this one! I could have written that chapter! This book kept me entertained and guessing throughout the whole book! The ending was great! After reading it I wondered why I never became an editor and went into the publishing business! Or wrote a book! Have a blast reading this book, you won't regret it! I can't wait for this author's next book, I love her style of writing!"
3,Haven't I Read This Before?,"This book is basically The Devil Wears Prada set in publishing rather than fashion. The plot is a little more interesting -- a mystery involving a manuscript that eerily echoes the protagonist's life adds a dimension not explored in The Devil Wears Prada. It is definitely a page-turning novel, if you can get past the fact that Lauren Weisberger created the template that Debra Ginsberg adapted."
3,Devil Wears Prada Redo,"The writing is good - that much cannot be denied. But, the plot is identical to that of The Devil Wears Prada. The only difference? This is set in a publishing company and not a fashion company. A unique plot would have made the book stronger."
1,"Bad writing, bad characters, bad ""mystery""","I disliked this book enough to come here and write a negative review. I thought the writing was good in places, but the love story plot line is so badly drawn I thought for a long time it was supposed to be a spoof (similar to the ""blind submission"" sections).The characters are either evil (Lucy), weak (Angel), crazy for unexplained reasons (Malcom, Anna), or one dimensional (Damiano).The mystery of the ""blind submission"" should be clear to most readers by the mid-point of the book. Several red herrings are thrown in but only the characters in this book are really silly enough to believe them.All in all, I really thought this book was worse than a waste of time."
5,Terrific Tale!,"I loved this novel. Set in Petaluma and San Rafael, CA (with a jaunt to NYC) the locales were some I'm familiar with which added to the realism for me. I loved the novel-within-a-novel gambit and the writing was well done. I loved the characters - couldn't put this book down. If you're into writing or just like a great story with good pacing and well-drawn characters and a bit of mystery, this is an ideal beach read."
4,No crazy additives. . .,"I can't speak for other owners, but my four cats really love this food. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because you need to use their call of the wild supplement if you use this wet food as your cats only food. Overall this is a great balanced food that is closer to a cats natural diet than most over processed canned and dried food. Its one of the few commercial canned foods out there that does not have by products or grain. My cats really enjoy the taste of the supplement too."
4,My two cats really enjoy the Au Jus cans,"Unlike the previous reviewer, my cats like the Au Jus cans. They enjoy the chicken, turkey, rabbit and duck flavors. I like to feed my cats a high-protein diet to keep them trim, and this food helps me reach that goal.The only reason I'm giving the food 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't feed it alone. It doesn't have the vitamins cats need as a standalone food. It's good for a meal a few times a week or top-dressed with supplements. I also wish the Au Jus varieties came in the smaller cans. It's hard for 2 cats to go through a huge can in a couple of days.If you're feeding your cats grocery store foods, they probably won't like this. If they're used to eating premium foods and occasional raw meat like mine are, they should take to this food with no problem."
1,29 cats can't be wrong,"I tried a case of this for my nine cats, and NONE of them would eat it. I gave the last 10 cans to someone who has 20 farm cats (20 cats will manage to eat ANYTHING vaguely edible to cats, right? 20 cats might eat YOU if you're not careful). Those cats didn't like this food either.I'm not sure how Wysong managed to get cats to not like chicken, but they did it."
1,The Not Il Piacere,"I'm struggling with Il piacere in Italian and the struggle is proving to be more than worth it. Huge vocabulary, rich descriptions and, wow, the action!!!!! In the process, I've found the Harding translation to English in various places on the web. The Harding translation is NOT D'Annunzio's book. Don't even waste money buying it. Like Karl P and Dr. Price, I wish this book were available in an accurate translation."
4,When in Rome...read this book,"D'Annuzio gives us the intimate details of the decadent lifestyle of a ne'er-do-well Roman count and his social class. The facts of the story could be told in a few sentences, but (like his contemporary Henry James) its the way he tells the story not the story itself that is the most appealing. His descriptions of Rome and the country villas of the rich make it a great book to take on a trip to Italy."
5,Hooray for Life Skills Games,Teaching life skills the traditional way in the classrooms are boring and mundane. This books allows the escape of traditional and captures adventure and excitement.
3,Okay wheel; felt is tiny,"The wheel seems to spin smoothly and with several tries I got numbers in different locations each time. What stands out about this set is that the felt is very small, with very small boxes. The included chips will fit, but if you are planning to use this with a regular clay chip set, it won't really work too well."
2,Very Small than what we see in the picture,"The set with the chips is for kids and not for actual fun play on weekends. Dont Buy this, waste of money :("
4,From the back of the book:,"This book is a rich source for Native American and Moravian history. The 1772-1781 diaries remain largely untapped by American scholars because they have not been available in English translation. Publication of this modern scholarly edition, therefore, will have a major impact on the field of early American history. This edition contains a cornucopia of ethnographic and historical information about the Delawares and neighboring tribes in the upper Ohio Valley during the Revolutionary era. The editors have done an excellent job of identifying and expanding the knowledge of many of the important figures from this period. This volume will be welcomed by any scholar interested in the early history of Ohio or western Pennsylvania-a most valuable addition to the collections of published primary materials on these subjects."
3,"not bad, not bad","while there are some great blues tracks on here, and rusty is an amazing guitar player, he plays with ease and puts his heart and soul into it, rusty strays from the blues here and there and more into the funk. my favorite track is the real stuff."
2,An artist confused and misguided,Somewhere along the way a friend or well meaning fan told Rusty Zinn he should focus more on his singing and less on guitar...Bad idea...Zinn is an expert at aping blues guitar heros of yesterday but has never truely found a style of his own . His singing while well meaning and certinaly better than some of his other guitar hero peers it is not up to the material he has chosen here . As of late urban contemporary black radio is actually giving airplay to a whole new group of talented performers that sing and believe it or not play instruments . If you are really interested in the forms of music Zinn is attempting I would suggest going to the R&B section of your favorite record store or shop Amazon for some of the incredible neosoul that is out today...I strongly suggest for reggae the band Culture and for deep soul check out KC and JOJO John Legend and Angie Stone .
4,An exhaustive study of the clan system of Scotland.,"This book, in itself, is a study in the origin of the clan system in Scotland and a general history of how the Highlanders came to be in the land of Scotland as it is known today. Highlanders: A History of Scottish Clans isa book anyone interested in the Clans of Scotland would find quite informative. Seasoned historians alike could learn much from Fitzroy McLeans' book about the Highlanders. His approach is fresh, his timing is superb, his views keenly discriminating. To the origins of the Scottish Highlanders his facts are unequalled. A must for any historian or genealogist studing the names of Scotland"
2,"Disappointing, hard to read.","I am a technical editor. I was so distracted by half-page sentences and incorrect punctuation that I couldn't continue reading. The author knows a great deal of history, but he jumps from century to century so fast that I couldn't keep track of whom he was talking about or what century he meant."
3,Somewhat disappointed.,"I am a fairly recent fan of Petra, so I was hoping for some new music (although I knew it wasn't very likely with their recent break-up). When I found out about this CD, it was obviously not new music, but I was expecting at least a best-of collection. However, this is not even a best-of collection. They just took two of their earlier CDs, ""Petra Praise 1: The Rock Cries Out"", and ""Petra Praise 2: We Need Jesus"", put them together in a slipcover, and released them as a unit. In my opinion, that is rather cheap.On the other hand, there is a beneficial side to this. If you do not have these CDs and you want them both, you can now get them easier, and probably cheaper too.Even so, I am somewhat disappointed with this CD. I have not bought it and do not plan to. I don't mean to say that I don't like the music, I just am not very interested. The music is probably great and I do recommend it for those who want some good praise music. Listen and enjoy."
3,More Lovin' than John,Any John is welcomed but the title is deceiving. Of the 29 cuts only 7 are John solo. Pretty much leaves us without the 35 years of his great career after The Spoonful.
3,"GREAT FIGHT SCENES, PREDICTABLE PLOT","The fight scenes, of which there are many, in MARTIAL OUTLAW are choreographed beautifully with some unique and original slants on familiar martial arts moves.Jeff Wincott looking buffer than ever plays DEA agent Ken White, who is set on bringing down a Russian drug dealer. Gary Hudson is Jack White, Wincott's older brother who is an LA Cop, a cowboy and unfortunately, a very dirty cop. Hudson ends up betraying his brother so he can muscle in on the drug deal and wind up with a million cool ones. Veteran character actor Richard Jaeckel plays their father, a retired cop who wants to be proud of his sons, but has ended up an alcoholic, thanks to his suspicions about his son Jack.Wincott and Hudson perform sincerely, but the end is predictable. However, the fight scenes work and for a martial arts film, it's above average. Wincott is one of the better heroes of this genre."
1,Sweet but packaging was a REAL bummer!,"These jelly beans are my favorite. The problem was that little care was taken in packing. When the package arrived, I was so excited that I opened the package in the parking lot of my office. The inner packaging was broken and I wound up with nearly the full pound on the lot! Try Superior Nut thru Amazon instead; they packed them right and it arrived perfect!"
4,Refreshing,"Great action story, great vision, Held my interest from beginning to end. Violence is non-graphic. All actors portrayed their roles well, including the wild animals. What more can I say? We'd seen half the movie on TV recently but desperately wanted to know the rest of the story. Glad we were able to find it on Amazon."
4,Tanya Roberts is Awesome,"I always loved this movie...She is a woman of action, in a beautiful scenario, and with a really great soundtrackThe only problem with this movie is the plot, it doesn't get to you very well.Tanya Roberts did most of the stunts here...great work.(...)(...)"
2,Lousy video values,"The movie was never meant to be an Oscar worthy film. It was made for pure entertainment and to show case Tanya Roberts in all her glory. My problem is I own a 65"" HD television and the print quality is horrible from this DVD. Grainy and foggy in detail. Maybe if it ever is on Blu-Ray and wide screen it may be worth the money, in this form it is not."
3,Comic book fun with a female Tarzan.,"Comic book fun gives girls a chance to have a Tarzan like superhero. Predates the Xena craze which in this case allows lead character to not only be strong but have a sexy innocence. Kids will like the animals and colorful action, while adults will like the African scenery and role reversal relationship between Sheena and the male lead. Rated PG for jungle violence and some brief unoffensive nudity, this cute family action picture might be worth a look if your looking for an old fashioned Indiana Jones type of film."
3,Soundtrack now available,"While I have never seen the movie, I'm responding to the request below for information on the music. The soundtrack is now out [on Sarabande, I believe--and my 3 stars is based on the music, not the visuals]."
3,France Zobda is a Goddess...........,"The only good thing about this film is the stunning, Martinican beauty France Zobda, definately one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the big screen. Too bad we have not seen her more on American film. She is very big in France and the entire Francophone world. She is a true Nubian goddess!"
3,I like it,"Ok, don't laugh. I know to many people this movie is probably a little cheesy, but it has it's moments. I saw it when I was 8, and for some reason ever since, I have always loved this movie. Maybe it's the fantasy of communicating with animals, riding bareback on a zebra, the beautiful scenery, the african landscape, the healing sand that they stick people in for however long... I'm not really sure, but it is one of my favorites. I bet the comic is great and I would love to see a remake of the movie done maybe more true to the comic. Not the show (I'm a little nervous if it will be any good), but a more true to the comic depicted movie. It really is one of those good old fashioned adventure flicks. Not enough of those being made any more. I almost want to give it 4 stars cuz I like it so much, but that wouldn't be true rating I guess. It's an average movie, but the scenery is spectacular and the story has it's moments."
2,Sheena has missteps,"First, if you want to see the best definitive Sheena, see the 1956 TV show starring Irish McCalla.The saddest words of tongue or pen, what could have been. The Tanya Roberts Sheena has a great glare but lacks the comic book leopard print costume and leadership. They should have had Tanya fight in hand to hand combat instead of falling out of helicopters.If they ever add extras, they should show the Christie Brinkley and Sharon Stone in costume audition footage."
4,Tanya Roberts and Ted Wass played it to perfection!,"This is a beautiful film, a love story that breaks hearts. How many times in a movie do two people fall desperately in love but....well I won't write anything else except that it was the most touching and beautiful ending since ""Casablanca"". You'll see why. The music and score is very important to me in films and this one is wonderful. The last shot in the film (about 5 minutes long and all one take) is one of the most elegant and graceful exits I've ever viewed. See if you can take your eyes off it. Even though the plot has been filmed to death over and over thoughout the years the director and his cast, in my opinion, really made this film stand out. I just wish Sony, which owns this film would release a dvd with some ""real"" extras in it. Craig"
2,Sheena Was Made To Showcase Tanya Roberts,"Sheena wasn't made to win any Academy awards. Nevertheless, for a ""B"" film the photography is actually quite good. Granted, Tanya's acting ability at this time in her life needed a lot of work. I'm sure the producers were aware of this going in and didn't care. They knew the attraction would be to watch Sheena doing her thing in her jungle outfit. Tanya was the perfect choice considering the reason for the film. Sheena was made to showcase Tanya Roberts stunning physical attributes and was successful in this regard. She is the reason the movie is still moderately popular after 20 years. So if you like this type of eye-candy film, enjoy! It wasn't meant to be anything else."
3,Sheena-- A Female Tarzan!,"Ok, I can say I liked this movie. Tanya Roberts does a a good job in the title role as ""Sheena."" I can also say, this is not Tanya's best work.If I had to categorize this flim I'd call it a Romance/Action-Drama. Something this movie has going for it is the eye catching scenery. It's beautiful! The interaction with the animals is amazing!Though I enjoyed this movie, I feel I should should state, this movie is not for everyone. As I was watching this film the one thing that kept running through my mind was... ""Sheena-- A female Tarzan."" That is the BEST way I can describe this film.If you like Tanya Roberts, or enjoy Tarzan movies you will probably like this movie."
4,Memories,Loved this movie because it brought back memories of me and my sister watching thisThe acting is lame which entertained me even more!
2,Rumble in the Jungle,"If you like a good Jungle flick, this isn't it. The only saving grace is Tanya Roberts showing her assests (nude) in the movie, so if you missed Roberts centerfold spread this dvd will do."
2,SEXY!,"WOW! This movie is so stupit but is Tanya Roberts something else or what. This is a mans pleasure movie mostly, I watch this for Tanya Roberts. Just watching her bounce around on that zebra bareback is fun to watch. Its sexy how she talks to the animals, and I don't even know what the main point is I just watch it for sheena riding in the jungle."
1,And the jungle reeked for days...,"Tanya can't act her way out of a - well, anything, but she can get out of any clothing whatever, and the gratuitous shots from below as she climbs trees and swings from ropes are great good fare for pubescent teenage boys without much of a social life. Fred Wass does what he does best, wanders around on cue and collects a paycheck for no obvious reason. Any one over the age of eighteen will want to drink a lot of beer while wasting time with this."
5,I liked this movie.,"Well, it was maybe bad acting but I really liked the plot. A woman a part of the animals. I am looking very hard for the soundtrack to this movie. The music was great. If anyone can help please contact me."
3,"Silly, But Good Mind Candy","I remember watching this when it first aired on HBO YEARS ago and being strangely facinated by it. Don't expect any A movie acting or plot - it's straigt B movie fare all the way, but fun I'll admit. What gets an A is the heart-achingly beautiful music score at the end of the film. If anyone, ANYONE knows how to obtain a copy of that please post your information here!!!"
4,sheena,every thing about this order was great price was fair as for a used dvd that it self was in great shape also to my suprise all in all I'm pleased
4,Cheesy Fun,"I liked it. Nobody was in danger of winning an Academy Award for this one, but it was fun and entertaining. The scenery was beautiful (both the African landscape and Tanya Roberts). It was shot on location in Kenya. I always like films shot on location more than those that create a ""location"" using CGI mumbo jumbo. There's no substitute for being there. The characters were likeable and the story was fast paced and entertaining. The two nude scenes were tasteful, simply showing Sheena bathing in a waterfall and lake. Cheesy elements that added to the fun include the ridiculous dialogue already mentioned by other reviewers, Sheena's Dr. Doolittle animal mind control routine, and the ""zebra"" she rode, actually a horse, as zebras have never been domesticated. Sit back and enjoy it for what it was meant to be, light, breezy entertainment."
3,Sheena still has sheen,"When Sheena The Queen of the Jungle (Tanya Roberts) clashes with unscrupulous big city types, she calls on her animal friends -- Marika the zebra, Kima the jaguar, Katula and Keibar the lions, and Tiki and Chiki the chimps -- to help her rumble in the jungle. With the exception of a replica rhino head and some phony flamingoes, the carnivorous animals in Sheena are real and usually just a hair's breadth away from the actors. Marika the zebra is portrayed by an Arabian horse adorned with artistically painted stripes.The movie's definitely dated, but it's a true guilty pleasure and anyone who enjoys an old-style jungle adventure won't be disappointed."
3,Husqvarna Bar Oil,"Come on. Really, a review? It's bar oil. I bought it because they are the only ones I know of to sell a separate winter oil."
3,what year is this set in?,"I'm about a third of the way through this book. The author talks about an unfurnished apartment in LA going for under $300 a month, and marvels at ""$50,000 homes."" That's a good clue that it's not set in 2012, but I'm not at all sure when it is supposed to be, and I'm a little frustrated.Also, the protagonist and his girlfriend seem to argue without much cause.Other than that, the plot and characters seem ok."
4,Passed the test!,"I had to take the MTTC in order to become ""highly qualified"" by the No Child Left Behind Act. I had not taken a course in Spanish since 1988. This guide helped me focus on what to study and the practice test was a great help. Much of the content was on the actual test."
5,Perfect,"I keep this in the back of my SUV and it has served many purposes! It was the base for a tent, a lining to protect my car as I moved firewood, a makeshift rain coat, and a ""disguise"" for my laptop when I had to leave it in my car. Would definitely purchase again."
4,It's a tarp...it's blue...it's a good value!,"It's really hard to get excited enough about a tarp to write a review, but here I am doing it. The best feature of this tarp...is it's price. For the price, you can't really do any better. I just needed a fairly large tarp to put under our tent when camping. This tarp does the trick, was cheaper than what I could find at a Walmart or Target, and is blue. Objectively, the tarp is nothing phenomenal. It's not very thick and I don't think it would last very long if left to cover something out in the hot sun 16 hours a day. But for all other purposes, I think it would work just fine. It did a great job keeping out the damp morning wetness from the ground while we were camping for a week in the Sierras. Since that was my main criteria for a tarp, I give this thing an A."
3,Size is a problem for this company: advertised is not delivered,"The tarp size, above, says ""8x10"", and that's what I ordered. I needed a tarp to go under an 8x8 tent. Then let's discuss what I got: a tarp that was 7'4""x9'6"" -- short 8 inches from 8 feet, short 4 inches from 10 feet. There are many good responses in this situation. One might be to contact the seller and return it. That would involve time, expense, and packaging. Instead, I'm just going to write this off as experience with these tarps, and go elsewhere."
2,Did not last 4 months,This item disintegrated when placed in a sunny area covering a flat surface. Completely worthless for covering cord wood or other items for longer than 1 month.
3,tarp,Not as good as expected. gromments started to fray away within a could of weeks and there are some tears in this 'no-tear tarp
4,"plain, cheap tarp","I bought this to go under our tent to protect the floor. It has been on a few camping trips and has held up well, even though used over rock a few times. Pretty good for a cheap tarp."
4,Great DVD!,"I really enjoyed this DVD, particularly since I have never been to Winsor Castle. This DVD allowed me to view the castle and estate as an insider/worker at Windsor would view the ancient estate. However there are at least three things I am disappointed in this DVD: (1) I would have like to have seen more of Frogmore and how that house is cared for by the staff; (2)The Mausoleum at Frogmore, I would have loved to seen, since it's only open twice a year to the public; (3) I would have also enjoyed seeing how the staff at St. George's Chapel care and maintain the numerous royal tombs."
3,Meh.,"I realize that review may be photograher blasphemy, but I didn't find this book to be as amazing as I had heard. This may be partially due to the fact that the photographs were taken in a time that I have a hard time relating to.As for the quality of the photographs and the quality of the book - both are top-notch."
3,Am I completely obtuse?,"I purchased this much heralded photo collection book after reading the review in Newsweek. Maybe I'm not artsy-sophisticated enough to understand the supposed power and humanness or whatever behind these photos. I just don't get them. For a much better look at people in general, look at the book The Life of Man, or even a book of Norman Rockwell paintings. Those books will give you a better idea of life from the 1920's to the 1970's, and the people. The only photo that did stand out to me was the cover photo of the bus. It's painful."
2,Frank found what he was looking for,"I'm not as impressed with this book as most critics are. Frank traveled around the U.S. and photographed pretty much what he was looking for: visual proof that Americans and their culture are crass, materialist, full of prejudice, and vulgar.This view has been a commonplace conceit of European artists and intellectuals, and it began even before the colonies had united to become the United States. It was a message that was sure to win him applause from Europeans and also from that portion of the American intelligentsia who take European judgements as final.I think Frank's photos are highly overrated and took little insight or understanding to create. They reflect mostly a typical European viewpoint and show almost no understanding of what this country and its people are really about."
3,Great book!,"The only reason I don't give the full five stars review is because I don't think the print is good enough. I'm sure they could do better. Another reason is because I got this book at $120 and now you can buy it for just $35!!! the same 2008 issue and everything.Anyway, this is one of the best documentary photography books."
4,iNTERESTING,Excellent print quality.. A glance at common people in random daily-life shots. It's a book worth a place in your hands
3,The Americans,"Robert Frank is an iconic photographer of American life. For people in their 50's or older it is nostalgic. And for those younger, it is a visual slice of our history. There are many stories here. A good book."
2,"Implausible, but readable.","Implausible, but readable. Many loose ends get tied up at the end, but not the biggest mysteries. Why would a D.A. quit his job to take on his old case for free, while endangering his pregnant wife? How could he just a few weeks later join an NBA team, and oh yeah, be a star. Lazy plotting and absurd coincidences occur far too often."
5,Always a great read,A Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi mystery is always a good read. Material Witness was excellent. Kept the readerinvolved until the very end.
4,Joes review,I have read most of Tanenbaum's books of the Karp family. They are all good and this one is no exception!
2,Readable Yet Not Realistic,"This is one of the earlier books in the Karp/Ciampi series by Robert Tanenbaum. The writer balances far too many plot lines and creates a most unlikely story. To his credit, it is most readable yet is nothing special. As time has progressed, the stories have gotten better than the work being reviewed."
2,"Cute pandas, but poor paper quality","The pandas featured in this 2006 calendar are really cute ane one glance makes you fall in love instantly with them.Unfortunately, the paper this calendar (distributed by Browntrout Publishers) is rather poor quality. Each sheet is thin and tears easily. Worse, after hanging on my cubicle wall for 2 weeks, the paper is already turning yellowish.If you want a 2006 wall calendar featuring pandas, considering the one distributed by Petprints, also available on Amazon, just search for ISBN/ASIN 1843028530. The pandas are equally cute, and the paper quality is better.Go panda, go!"
3,It losses two minutes every week.,"I bought one in a jewerly store, it had two serial numbers, it worked just fine.For any reason I lost it and ordered another one through Amazon to a watch dealer. It had only one serial number. It lost two minutes every week. I send it three times to be repaired with no improvement. I don't use it anymore."
2,Disappointed,"I had always wanted a Tag watch and finally received this Aquaracer as a gift. First off, it looks and feels good. However, the luminous dial is very small and weak. It is nearly impossible to see the hands even after just turning off the lights in a completely dark room. The second problem is that the automatic movement stops if not worn for 10 hours or so. This is a bit inconvenient, I put mine on first thing in the morning to make sure it keeps running. I would not get the automatic if I was buying this watch again. Hope this is helpful for other Tag fans."
4,Gave me the most insight into R. Johnson of any documentary I've seen.,"Ever wonder why people moon over Robert Johnson, but have the sneaking suspicion it's just hype? This gives insight into what made him great, in both his personality, intellect and ability, and his guitar playing. Johnny Shines really brings the time-period to light, in his interviews. I can't really say whether Clapton and Richards are sincere or not."
3,Weird trip hop...,"This is kinda weird music. Nothing like the peaceful and soft music that comes from Massive Attack or Alpha. ""Money Greedy"" is a track that has quite some energy in it - it's almost danceable. But I'm not really into Tricky's voice. It's almost like he's trying to be scary and mean. ""Anti Histamine"" is an experimental track, with Tricky and Martina Topley-Bird on the vocals. I think the female singer saves this track. Without her, it would be a little bit too dark and sinister.""Broken Homes"" is a beautiful one, and the best one. There is Tricky, and a childrenchoir, but the best is the ethereal, almost fragile voice of P(olly) J(ean) Harvey. She sings in a totally beautiful way, way different from her own full-cd's like ""To Bring You My Love"" or ""Is This Desire ?"". ""Girl"" from ""Dance Hall At Louse Point"" with John Parish comes close. Make sure you go for the original version of this song - ""Hip Hop Mix"" ( with Martina Topley-Bird ) is not as good."
4,Don't take this book too laterally ;-),"I got this book, along with 3 other Sloane & MacHale lateral thinking puzzle books for Christmas one year. At first it seemed like a sorry excuse for a gift, but as I read this one first, I found that it was a challenging endeavor of the mind. Lateral thinking, it seems, is taking a situation and finding a solution that is not the most obvious, but usually the most logical. That said, this is challenging to say the least. A good book for people who enjoy mind games."
2,A Generic Knife Block,"I bought this knife block in the hope I could store my Lion Sabatiers in one place. The openings are made without any tapering of the slots, that half my knives don't fit. This block must have been a generic block for manufacturers to stamp their logos on. It simply isn't meant to hold forged knives.If you are looking for a knife block for your forged Sabatiers and cannot find one, I recommend the Henckels Oak Block. I was lucky to have stumbled on one, and find it will fit a Lion Sabatier 8"" -or- 10"" chef's knife with no problem. The heft and strength of the Henckels oak block is vastly superior.However, this generic block will hold most stamped knives."
2,Decent block for thin knives,"Don't expect to keep your high end chefs knives in this block but if you just need something to get your cheap knives out of the drawer and onto the counter, it's a decent deal at [price]. I'll be trying to sell mine at a yard sale for $1."
5,Question everything you know!!!,"Lungfish continue their assault on the listeners senses. Everything about this album is beautiful and simple, as always Daniel Higgs takes the listener on a journey through his mind. The simple sincerety of the lyrics alone make this one of the best unheard albums in my opinion. If you have 50 minutes to devote yourself to some great beautiful music, pick this up and enjoy."
5,this must be a bally anime,"When a duck sees a sad prince dancing by her lake, she wishesfor nothing more than to make him smile. This wish transforms her into a ballet student at Kinkan Academy, in town where stories come to life. With the aid of a magical pendent, she also transforms into the prima ballerina Princess Tutu, who has the ability to return the prince's heart to him."
5,"Princess Tutu - Deep, Magical, Beautiful","I was somewhat apprehensive about this anime at first, but then I began to watch. It is one of the most creative, beautiful, and fulfilling anime I have ever seen. It wins the award for ""Best Use of Classical Music"" in anime. It also successfully combines the magical girl genre with Grim's fairy tales, all with a self referential psuedo philisophical backdrop (that really comes into play the last few episodes). One of the most intelligently crafted plots I have ever seen in anime, where details and characters slowly change, in a truly fulfilling way heading toward one of my favorite endings I have ever seen."
4,Useful,"I have used this dictionary for looking up Hawaiian words that are used in English newspapers, websites, and publications found on the Islands. This dictionary is useful for these basic needs."
5,music,My friend gave me this cd as gift. I wore out the first cd I played it so much. So I had to buy another.
3,This paper is too stiff,"When I began quilling I purchased these papers because they were priced a little cheaper than others I had looked at. I do not like them because they seem a tad thicker and are definitely stiffer than what I use now. (I use the paper strips by Quilled Creations. Some of their other products are featured on Amazon.) When used in fringing designs this paper is difficult to form into soft-looking flowers and end up looking like regular paper flowers. This is not the effect I want to achieve in my designs. To use up the Lake City paper I purchased first, I am using them to practice different shapes and designs before using the better quality paper for a finished project."
5,Rocking Good Film,"If ever there was a film that had me smiling, laughing and in stitches it would be PASTOR SHEPHERD. For those of you that have not seen this incredible film, get it TODAY!!! You wont regret a moment of the amazing humor and great acting in this one."
5,Outstanding Book For Thoughtful Introspection,"Whether you're religious, atheist, agnostic, or apathetic about faith, this book has something for you. Who doesn't wonder why we exist and what is the meaning of our existence? Dr. Young explores this fundamental question, the answer to which informs an individual's worldview regarding everything in life."
