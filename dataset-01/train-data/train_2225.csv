3,removing links??,the inside looks kind of cheap. but the watch overall is very attractive.does anyone know how to remove links from this watch? it doesn't have the arrows...
1,Oww!,I ordered this watch because I love the style and look. It came fast and looks great but the top of my arm is now full of cuts. The metal on the sides is so sharp. Also my brother tried it on and said that his arm hair kept getting pulled out. The watch works and everything I just don't enjoy all the cuts.
3,An Okay Watch,"This watch is pretty good considering the price. If you're expecting high end, obviously, you should seek elsewhere...... but for a nice every day watch, this one's pretty good."
3,Nice watch,"it looks nice, although i am a bit disappointed because only one side is in gold. ( the back of the strap is silver)."
5,Love this watch!,"Works great, well made, and looks AWESOME. I get complimented on this baby ALL THE TIME. Probably my favorite watch ever."
3,Works as advertised....but....,"I ordered this watch thinking I was fully informed as to what wouldarrive, that is, a gold tone retro-watch. I was a little surprisedand disappointed to find a silver tone watch, instead. Not abig deal, I suppose. It was a cheap enough losing gamble that I gave itto my son, who loves it. I'm sure it will serve him well.On the bright side, it only took three days to get here!"
1,Steer clear.....,Casio has a great rep with me when it comes to sport watches but this thing looks like the winner of the contest to create the cheapest p.o.s. and pass it off as a Casio. Plus the instructions are one they place in any number of their models. Try harder please!
1,nicks ripoff,I orderd this product one month and ten days ago and i still have not got it. what made me know i did not get it. tell the person/persons give me my order now or I sue!!!and why do I got to rate this item if I dont know how it is?
1,Don't be fooled,"There are many better books out there for the beginner or any practitioner of witchcraft. Not only is it very corny it is a general waste of time to read, and the ""personal accounts"" sound a bit questionable to me. If you are interested however, here are the subjects covered: Spells, developing your own ""magic witchcraft power"" (quotations mine), you can always win as witches do, healing, companionship, domination of others, astral travel, talking to the dead, and wealth magnets. ..."
5,Great fun!,"Brasil Brazil is a great group. Very exciting, great Brazilian rhythms! Both Ana Gazzola and Sony Santos have lovely voices, and they blend well. Whether they are singing separately or together, it is lovely. And the backup is good, too."
5,Thumbs Up,"Think back on your summers of lustful innocence. So much time on your hands. Time to do absolutely anything you desired. Time to explore yourself; time to explore your best friend... From beginning to end, Frisky Summer is a classic, must-have filled with smooth-chested, muscle-bound, young men."
3,A very rare weak performance from Corben.,"My main problem with the book is that it was'nt published in color. For Richard Corben material this is a major sin. I have no reason why it was'nt published in color, but even in black and white corben's art is superb.The secondary problem would be that of Bruce Jones's story. This is definitly not one of his best offerings to go along with Corben's artwork.If the book would have been published in color I'm sure I would have given it a 5 star rating because of Corben's breathtaking color art. However, with this effort in black and white, and the weak story (which could have been overcome with color art) the best I can give is 3 stars out of 5."
4,OK,"A little cheap looking, but for the price you can't complain. All other items from this seller were fine. Shipping was timely."
1,Poor source of detail,"After using this book (as well as books 2 and 3) as texts for a class, I must say that I found all of them to be overrated and a poor choice of reference. The volumes contain nice photographs but are ineffective as textbooks. For example, as material is introduced a sudden segue to a new subject leaves the reader cold. I would not recommend any of this series to those who need detail. These books support a teaching methodology that relies upon mundane memorization of incidental information rather than comprehensive study."
1,Was Excited to Be let down.,I was very disappointed in this book. It was part my fault for not reading into it more. I needed a newer edition. This book is too old for me to use.
3,"Easy to assemble, painting recommended","Even though the box said ""Painting not required,"" It is recommended to paint the details according to the photos on the box to make the model look more authentic, because the parts (except for the stand) are all molded in white. It is very easy to assemble. Plastic Cement is not required for most parts, but is recommended if some of the parts are loose."
2,Size Matters,The 1/200 should tell the physical size in inches for us who do not happen to know the actual size of the Shuttle in inches.Also the Challenger was not an option for name.
1,No Pronunciation Keys Nor Root meanings,"I really wanted the benefits of the traditional Strong's exhaustive concordance for the NASB, and thought this was it. It it great to be able to come in with an NASB word and find the other references and a meaning. But the pronunciation key and the root word references and numbers, as well as related meanings, ARE MISSING! These two features are a must have for me as a preacher as well as simply a student of the scriptures. If I can find something more complete for NASB, I'll be returning this."
2,dissapointing,This is an ordinary concordance not even like Young's. The verses are grouped by English word and not in subsections under the word by Greek word although they do have the Strong's numbers. The definitions at the back are less than three words long. The e-Sword computer program is much better with the NASB with Strong's numbers next to each word and with its more complete dictionary by Strong.
1,Very disappointed,"I am a student at Calvary Theological Seminary, and needed to find a good concordance to use for word studies. I thought this would be it, but was severely disappointed when I received it. I was hoping it would be a single hard copy source for not only locating the different locations a word is used, but also a complete definition or use of the word. I should have read all of the reviews on it, because I still have to go online to do a thorough study. A one stop place that I have found online to accomplish what I want is at bible.org. Their NeXtBible learning environment provides all that is needed for one source study. I am still searching for that perfect hardcopy, however! If anyone could suggest one, that would be awesome! By the way, thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy, I will get my money back! Thanks Amazon, you have been a real blessing to me in my studies. I have purchased many books from Amazon, and they always deliver! Amazon is a top notch company!"
3,More entertaining than informative,"There are several tid bits of useful information in the realm of adventure travel.This interlaced with personal stories makes for an entertaining read.Although not as nuts and bolts as ""Adventure Motorcycling Handbook"" I would consider it a welcome addition to my collection although not an entirely necessary one."
3,Not a neccessity for riding around the world,"The easiest way to review this book is to note that it compares rather unfavorably to the Adventure Motorcycling Handbook (AMH). It's a breezy read with a few important pointers, but once again, nothing that isn't covered in other, better books.With that said, the prose isn't exactly hackneyed, and if you're seriously contemplating riding a motorcycle around the world you should probably spend the $14 for this book--who knows, it might emphasize the one piece of information that will save you out on the road. On the other hand, if you're just trying to figure out if long-distance unsupported motorcycle travel is for you, buy the AMH."
3,Riding the World: The Biker's Road,"Some very good information from the Author, although a bit into himself. It was, however, interesting reading at times."
5,ROCKS,"I've had my MP3310 installed in my car for almost a year now. It's awesome. It plays everything I put in it (MP3s) and I haven't had any trouble at all with it. It's cheap (can be found for less than $...), and works wonderfully. If you're looking for an affordable MP3 CD receiver for your car, I hearitly recommend this.The only potential negatives I can think of are:1)No FF/RW within an MP3 - doesn't bother me but might be an issue for some.2)Some people might not like that it's silver/red - doesn't bother meBut the positives far outweigh those (potential) negativesBrian"
1,What's up with Jensen,I purchased a Jensen In Dash CD player similar to this one about 8 months ago. After about 2 months the unit stopped functioning. I contacted Jensen to find an authorized repair station - the unit had a 1 year warranty. A recorded message informed me that 'due to unforseen circumstances the customer help line is out of action' I have called several times over the last months only to get the same message. It would appear that Jensen are not standing by their product warranty.I also contacted the Better Business Bureau who told me that they couldn't contact Jensen either.I would seriously caution anyone thinking of purchasing any Jensen product to think again.
2,Great Band Loses Its Sound,"First off, let me say I love The Cruxshadows and Rogue, and I love gothic, techno and industrial music. That said, I hate any hybrid of the formentioned musical genres. Specifically, Techno and Gothic are like Yin and Yang--one is light, the other dark. Combined, they make for chaos.While ""Cassandra"" and ""Winter Born"" rock despite the rest of the album, Ethernaut sounds like typical Apoptygma Byzerk / VNV Nation redux (and if I wanted to listen to these groups, I'd buy their albums). Please, please, Rogue, go back to the genius behind ""Telemetry of a Fallen Angel"". It was a uniquely innovative, brilliant album with its own sound. I long for another ""The Mystery of a Whisper""."
1,It's got Synth-Pop/Techno - but where's the Goth music?,"All these Synth-Pop/Techno wanna-be Goth bands have completely destroyed the Goth scene forever.What ever happened to Gothic Rock? When did it turn from something cool to something so lame and predictable? Where's the creativity? All these bands sound alike now. Techno, techno techno, synthpop, synthpop, synthpop. We used to have Goth bands with different sounds within the genre, now all the clubs play this synth-pop and techno stuff, which has absolutely and utterly no relationship with what Goth started out as.I'm sorry but since I have taste and a sense of history I just can't listen to this drivel.Lame - boring - repetitive - soulless music"
2,"Very, very flat...","Though Ethernaut isn't ""bad,"" it isn't ""good"" either. Everything the band tries to do on this album has been done better by someone else. This is EBM Lite, barely industrial at all, and even then it never really breaches the watermark of mediocrity. If, like me, you're testing the proverbial waters of the Cruxshadows catalog for the first time, do not start with this album."
2,Dark Disco,"The last two outings by the Cruxshadows are the goth equivalent of Gloria Gaynor and/or The Village People.Why do they even have a guitarist? Can't hear it most of the time.The drum beats are the same through most of the album.Having lived in their home town and attended college with Rogue and have run in the same circles with him I can say that he is egomaniacal and a control freak. The real reason he lost the only good guitarist in the band (Kevin) is because Kevin liked to have a beer after gigs (Rogue doesn't drink alcohol or caffeine). Just a beer. Rogue would freak.I WILL give Rogue credit for being a very driven individual. He built that band up from nothing and pretty much runs the business side as well as the creative side. But make no mistake, the other band members are hired guns. Cruxshadows is Rogue and only Rogue.If you are a fan of this music I would recommend The Last Dance.They actually have guys that play instruments and not tons of programming with synths."
2,Too much techno,"It seems the Cruxshadows are gradually shifting closer and closer to techno pop and neo disco and leaving Goth behind. What is with this generation? Why has Gothic Rock become such a rarity? I love electronic music such as industrial/post industial and electro goth rock, but I despise Techo/Dance/Disco/EBM/Cyber Pop and I hate how it's spreading through the Goth scene like a cancer. (For those that aren't aware, there IS a HUGE difference between Industrial and synth pop) I'll stick to Deathrock thank you, and my OLD Cruxshadows cds... you know, back when they still played Rock & Roll."
5,It rarely leaves my car carousal!,"I love Cruxshadows, and this album in particular rarely leaves my car. My daughter loves it as well, which is great since a lot of my music can't be played around her."
5,Another great album,Yet another totally solid album by the Cruxshadows--they know their style and they execute it perfectly in Ethernaut. It's refreshing to see a band who delivers just what you expect time and again.
5,A very near perfect album,"I bought this because it contained the song Winterborn. I found out that it contains nothing but great songs and music. I have never before been able to put a CD into my car stereo and leave it there for a couple of months. Like a rich tapestry, there is always something new experience and love. This is a thinking person's music."
5,time to buy my second copy...,"This album is VERY addicting! I got it when it first came out, and it has been played everyday, in my car, at work, at home... can't get enough! This is synth-pop at it's best, it is clear that the composers were not just pushing buttons, but have a long and extensive knowledge of what they are doing, there are many levels to each song. I have to buy my second copy real soon, this poor CD has been used so much, it has had a very short life! I think that anyone who is into synthpop/dark-goth/wave, or whatever you want to call that type of music, is deprived if they don't own this album!"
5,Into...the...ether....do...not...be...ah...fraid....,"Ethernaut is another great instance of the Cruxshadows sound, definately not a disappointment after the last incredible album. This is one of their best!!! Try it! It tastes good."
1,What were they thinking?,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, but this movie literally made me sick. The casting was all wrong. Heather Locklear should not have played the title role. She is too old and had far too much plastic surgery. She just bother the holy crap out of me.The acting left much to be desired as well. It was almost as if every actor on the screen mentally told themselves: ""Hey! This is for Lifetime, let's do a half a** job. We still get paid whether the movie is crap or not.""Also, I think that the editing was entirely shoddy. If you haven't read the book you might be okay with the flow of the movie, but if you have there might be places were you have to stop and go: ""Uh?""I don't know how much creative input Nora Roberts has with these movies, but she seriously needs to put her foot down."
3,Beautiful Scenery but plot too Contrived,"Ok, first off in order not to be too disappointed, you must realize that this is not your typical big budget full length Hollywood movie. In fact it is only about 95 minutes long, which will make it a good TV movie.The sets in this movie and the scenery are the greatest asset to this film. The plot, was a bit too contrived, this irritated me. Why on the said morning of a murder, just come to town, Reece (Heather Locklear) would be the only person on hand to witness this event?It is at that point her disturbed past is revealed and questions arise concerning her mental state. Feeble attempts are made to project some misdirection, but the real bad guy is just too obvious.As a sub-plot, the residents of the community seem very pre-occupied with getting into the ladies' pants, and three mild sex scenes are thrown in to try to add some spice the film.Overall, this film is just OK, and nothing here really to rave about."
4,Good Movie!,"I'm not a Nora Roberts fan but enjoyed this movie enough to want to read the book. I like the storyline, the characters and the setting with its incredible scenery. I disagree with those who criticize Heather Locklear as the lead part - she did a great job of portraying the tough but vulnerable Reece which was refreshing to see since a lot of her parts are of arrogant, overly-confident types. I also like the romance between Reece and Brody which was effective without being too sappy. Overall enjoyable movie!"
3,Angels Fall - Nora Roberts,I read the book (which was one of my favourites) and I know changes must be made to the script for a shorter version - still it was a good movie. I think that the perfect actors were chosen for each character in the story.. Well done!!
2,okay TV movie of the week,"It's a predictable story with mediocre actors in a lovely setting. There's not much else to say about this film, which appears to be one of those TV movies of the week that is okay for brief but forgettable entertainment."
1,Don't judge the book by this movie,"I really enjoyed this book and was excited when I heard the movie was coming out. But what a disappointment that turned out to be. For the most part it followed the book with just a few changes, but the acting was horrible. Heather Locklear is a decent actress, but I don't know what she was doing here - it definitely was not acting. The scene where she heard the car backfire was comical. She was supposed to look like she was ducking for cover, in fear for her life. Instead it looked like she was doing an initial rehearsal of the the scene, going ""ok, this is where I hear the car, think it's gunfire, and I go like this...""For those of you who have seen the movie but not read the book, please do yourselves a favor and read the book. You'll be pleasantly surprised, and hopefully the book will wash the foul taste of this movie out of your head."
4,Angel Falls,"I had read the book and loved it. It kept me on the edge till the end. The movie was set in beautiful scenery and I liked it alot. The book was better, but you can't get it all in a movie in an hour and a half. Wish they would have done a mini series! I bought the movie and 3 other made for TV movies by Nora Roberts. I have enjoyed all of them. This one the most!"
2,Male Lead Almost Worth Watching it For,"I have not read the book, but for a TV movie I thought this started out pretty well. The mountainous Western setting is beautiful and the story line kept my interest. Locklear's peculiar facial cosmetic semi-disfigurement is distracting, but the leading man had no such problems, was pretty good, engaging, and so very easy on the eyes. Sadly, the last half degenerated into a laughable made for TV movie. The best was when she was running through a birch tree forest, hysterical with fear, out in the middle of nowheresville on the side of a mountain and was miraculously found by both the boyfriend AND the sherrif simultaneously. WTH? Was she running with a tracking device? The very last scene was kind of like the director yelled ""That's a wrap!"" before anyone was ready or prepared. Very odd."
1,distracted by plastic surgery,"I never read the book nor did I know there was one. I actually checked this movie out from the library. The movie was actually boring and I was continually distracted by Heather Locklear's appearance. Unfortunately her plastic surgery makes her face appear swollen, distorted and ugly; i could not believe that this woman was once attractive; way too old to play this role in this very dull, uninteresting movie."
2,Don't like this movie at all,"I first want to say that I did not read the book this movie is based on. So it is not that I do not like the movie because of changes made to the story. It is just not a good movie. The story is not exciting at all. Heather Locklear was a beautiful woman once, but I kept looking at her cheeks (has she got implants??), she looked so odd. And waaaay too old for this part! Don't understand why she needed plastic surgery, she used to look better than this. But about the story: predictable, not interesting and a bit lame actually. I was sorry to have bought the DVD.'Montana Sky' was better."
1,No reception...!,I bought this little radio hoping to use it on a cross country trip. and after it arrived i was so disappointed that it had no reception!!! It went back to Texas...
3,SONY SRFM70 WALKMAN,VOLUME CONTROL VERY RASPY - I AM TRYING TO CLEAN IT WITH CONTACT HEAD CLEANER WHICH I VAVE USED BEFORE WITH SUCCESS.
4,$300.00 for a radio?,I've had this unit for about 5 years and it finally died so I'm looking at different ones. $300 for $20 radio? I don't think so.
2,more of the same,There are no new ideas or stretches here. Although doing these stretches regularly will work - I was looking for something a little more groundbreaking.
1,Joseph and His Brethren,"This is a ghastly misrepresentation of the Genesis account of the compassion and forgiveness Joseph shows for his erring brothers. Instead, the movie shows Simeon being beaten with no objection from Joseph. As far as Joseph's moral character is concerned, the movie shows him in bed with Potiphar's wife before he gets a clue to flee from her; and I've seen pets show more affection for their masters than Joseph shows for his father whom he hasn't seen for more than 10 years. The director might have been awarded an Oscar had he presented the facts of this story as they have been preserved in the Book of Genesis. As it is, no one could PAY ME to watch this movie again. Please save your money and read the beautiful Bible's account of Joseph and his brethren. This is a movie serious Bible students must avoid."
2,Poor sound quality.,The biblical accounts are not represented with a great deal of accuracy.Much creative license is used in the portrayals.But the biggest drawback is poor sound quality.
1,Bible Time Classics,"This is horrible!!!!!! I can not believe that other people gave this a good rating. I wish I have never bought this product. In the past, I have bought a number of classical bible movies, and they were GREAT!! But this, I can't even return this hunk of junk! Do not under any circumstance buy this collection. To tell you the truth, it doesn't deserve any stars at all. The films is all blurry, the back ground music is warped. The plot of the stories are truly B-rated. From now, I will be alot more cautious when purchasing my bible collection movies."
1,Not true to scripture,"First, if you want a DVD about Joseph, buy the DVD ""Jacob and Joseph."" It is well-worth it. Don't waste your money on this DVD.This DVD ""Joseph and his Brethren"" is not faithful to scripture. The worst example is that it portrays Joseph as an angry, rebellious young man, not the upright, industrious man in scripture.There are other instances which run even more in direct contradiction to scripture. I bought this DVD several months ago, and watched it only once. I forget exactly what these were, but if you watch the video, and you know Genesis, you will see the contradictions. I don't plan to watch this again, so I will not bother to find what the problems were exactly. But take my word for it, you will be disappointed if you buy this."
2,Feeling sorry for porthiar's wife?,this movie is ok but not great. it makes you feel sorry for porthiar's wife. and she was the devil. so this movie is a so-so. nothing to write home about. and i don't feel sorry for her.
3,Movie quality varies,"The quality of the four movies in this collection vary greatly in quality. I do applaud the attempt to save some of the cinema for future generations and I found these versions of three bibilical stories and one pseudo-biography interesting variations on their stories. You also get the chance to see some young fairly famous stars before they were very famous at all.The movies included are:""David and Goliath"" starring Orson Welles and Ivo Payer""Joseph and His Brethren"" starring Goeffrey Horne and Robert Morley""Martin Luther"" starring Niall MacGinnis and John Ruddock""Esther and the King"" starring Joan Collins and Richard Egan."
3,For reference only,"The production values here render these volumes strictly for a reference settings: bindings are woefully inadequate to support the weight of the pages in each volume, no index in the individual volumes -- this series has a very low usability factor unless you are sitting in a comfy chair at the Bodleian for a half-hour perusal. As for Taruskin's writing, it's hard to avoid the feeling that the periods/composers he is interested in get a disproportionate number of pages (and close analysis), while those for whom he is antipathetic get very short shrift indeed (Gombert rates a scant 2 and a half pages of text). One can't escape the imbalances in this vast work, while nonetheless admiring the learnedness of it all. Thus, a really indigestible meal however tasty individual courses may be. Perhaps an error in judgement by the OUP. Thankfully, their publications in (say) the area of philosophy are better thought through."
1,Very Bad Design,"I agree with the majority of reviewers. This light is much too bright. If you want a clock radio that doubles as a night light this product is for you, but most people prefer to sleep in the dark.Another horrible feature is if you want to wake to a CD it always plays the CD starting with the first track which can get repetitive very quickly. There is a ""random"" feature but it DOES NOT work for the alarm. Of course you can change the CD daily to wake to a different song but you're still limited to the first track on each CD."
5,Spirit Filled Music,Great down home excellence is found on this CD. The way only Shirle Caesart can deliver it. No Club Gospel found here. Pure spirit led and filled music. Great words and work.
5,CLASSIC CAESAR!!!,EXPECT NOTHING BUT THE FINEST ON THIS REMARKABLE COLLECTION ON CLASSIC SISTER SHIRLEY CAESAR HITS!!
1,DVD didn't work,"The ball was fine, average, nothing wrong with it. But the instructional DVD that came with it didn't work, it read ""disk error"" on all of my DVD players and would not load on my computer either. Per Amazon's policy, I attempted to contact the company first, multiple times, I finally received a rude reply that they only replaced things bought on their webside. So much for a company standing by it's product! When I contacted Amazon customer service with this information, they fixed the problem immediately. GO AMAZON!! I would NEVER by another product from The Firm again!"
4,Pretty good ball!,"We bought these for seating at the office and 4 out of the 5 we bought have held up well. The 5th one is deflated - must have a hole. The others have required intermittent pumping to maintain their resistance, but that is to be expected, since the rubber stretches. They're a hit with the team!"
3,Buffy the Vampire Slayer : Uninvited Guests,"I found this book to be one of my least favorite. It was a little too ""giggly"" if you will. It tend to jump around quiet often from page to page. I had a hard time following the flow of the story as the author tried to explain each different ""attack""."
1,Fiction and belief,"Did the ""most qualify Fatima expert of out times"" even read the inteire archives and manuscripts at the sanctuary ? Of cours not.How can maintain these authors such belifs stories without any consubstanciated and critical analysis of the documents? Did he knew the TRUE first description is the Lady made by Lucia dos Santos? Of course not! A faith work, very pious yes, but NOT History."
5,"sweet, not ""perfumy""","Smells like Tucson when the orange trees are blooming-- not at all ""perfumy"" , but lasts longer than you might expect. A perfect spring/summer fragrance. To add a little depth, I layer it with Comptoir Sud Pacifique Eau de Cacao."
5,Light and beautiful,The closest I've come to Orange Blossom without strange undertones. This is a beautiful perfume.
3,Disappointing,"We went to see Shoji in Branson. My husband wanted a CD to listen to so I ordered this one. Unfortunately the playing is a hair out of tune making it painful listening. The tempo for ""Danny Boy"" is also slower than one would like. I do like the selections.The following songs are included:* Londonderry Air* Fiddler on the Roof Medley: Tradition/If I Were A Rich Man/Sunrise, Sunset* Blue Danube Waltz* Moon Over the Ruins* Wildwood Flower/Joy* Canon in D* Ashokan Farewell* Stardust/Smoke Gets in Your Eyes* Somewhere My Love* The Way We Were/Yesterday* Love Story* Fun Classical: Four Seasons""Spring""/Sonata in G Minor"
4,Not as good as the first book,"When I read Frey's first book from the library I was madly scribbling notes on all the wonderful things he had to say. I bought the second book thinking that would give me what the first had and more, but I didn't like it as well. It seemed like a rehash and not as well done as the first, which I ended up buying afer all. I think How to Write A Damn Good Novel I is one of the best 've read on how to make your novel coheseive and dramatic instead of melodramatic. Only SELF-EDITING FOR FICTION WRITERS has given me more concrete and excellent ideas on dialogue and character. Both books have illiminating examples from such novelists as P.D. James, Le Carre, Fitzgerald, and Flaubert to show you how to impletment the craft they describe so well. Both can make you a much, much better writer if you apply the principles described. People who say writing can't be taught need to read these books!"
5,How to Write a Damn Good Novel II is a damn good book,"How to Write a Damn Good Novel II is a damn good book. Since the late 1990s, I attempted to write a novel but to no prevail. I had a great idea but I had no idea how to write a novel. In December 2008, I bought How to Write a Damn Good Novel and read the first page to the last page trying to soak up every word. I studied the book like a textbook. Months later, I bought Mr. Frey's follow-on book How to Write a Damn Good Novel II. I also studied this book like a textbook. My manuscript titled The Empty Lot Next Door is now making its rounds at the publishers so only time will tell if it is successful. However, Mr. Frey's inspiration and instruction made me finally stop thinking about writing and finally start writing. Thank you Mr. Frey!Arthur M Mills JrAuthor: The Empty Lot Next Door"
1,Absolute Trash,"[Reviewer's edit: Prior to a necessary renaming of the product, this meretricious tool used to be called, ""High Quality Watch Band Pliers.""]Despite the misleading product name, this tool is anything but ""high quality."" The very first time I used mine, I irreparably bent the thing beyond recognition.It's frightening to imagine how any reviewer could confuse this laughable junk with a quality tool. It is made from cheap, soft base-metal, made in China, suitable for sale in a dollar store, at best. And that's the good news.The bad news is that the design itself is so flawed, illogical, and flat-out wrong, I'm just thankful that it's not an airplane part."
1,very difficult to use,"the master that made the work for me did the pin removal and she end up scratching my watch. It is very difficult to use, buy other stationary products instead, not this hand held one."
4,Handy Tool,I've used this link remover successfully on one of my watches and it worked fairly well. I also bought a plastic one in the past from Amazon but it isn't as easy to use as this. I was also glad to see that it came with an extra pin as I'm sure the original will wear out eventually.My only complaint is that after using it 2 times or so I found that the piece that holds the watch from the back tends to slide when trying to push the pin out/back in. This could just be because this watch was older and was harder to remove in general. For the most part when I tightened this part as much as I could it stayed in place. I still recommend this product.
2,Not worth the cost,Pins are too long and too soft Both bent and broke on the first try. Could not find replacement pins so I have a useless tool
4,"Works, but you have to be careful the pins are THIN!","This is like a bicycle chain tool. It's easy to misalign the tool and bend the pusher pin. But if you are reasonably careful it works very easily. Just do this over a table cloth to catch the bits if you accidentally drop them.You may want to gather a few paper clips as well. They make nice pusher tools for replacing the pins. Again, gently does it. I also used the flat side of some chopsticks to push with.All in all, if you are reasonably handy and careful you'll be able to resize pin watch bands fairly easily."
5,I don't usually write reviews...,"But this Plier works exactly as advertised. I had no problems with making quick adjustments with watchbands with d i r e c t i o n a l a r r o w s, and I have no experience at all with servicing jewelry!"
2,not fluffy,"The comforter is nice enough but htere is no way this is 750-fill power. I did some research before buying this and everywhere I read said that 700 fill power and above is superior and very fluffy, but after receiving the product and letting it air out and attempting to hand fluff it, it is no fluffier than my old down comforter that is only about 3 inches thick."
1,Bulldog 6002PRO Professional Car Alarm,"I purchased the 6002PRO, the alarm had problems from day one. The alarm had to be sent back to factory (at my expense) for an ajustment for sensitivitey. I was promised an additional transmiter for my inconvenience, when the alarm came back there was no extra transmiter. I could get no satisfaction from factory. I kept getting too many false alarms so finally disconected siren and use it strictly for remote door locks. My advice. DON'T BUY ANY BULLDOG PRODUCTS."
2,Call Customer Support - BEFORE buying,"If you are thinking of buying from this company I would suggest you first call their toll free support number 800-878-8007, leave a message and wait for a return call.In the process of installing the alarm, I called their technical support group several times. Each time I reached a voice mail box asking for me to leave my name and number and they would call back. Most times this never happened and I had to call them back a second or third time.I purchased this alarm just before Christmas. When I opened the package and tested each of the buttons on the remotes, I discovered one of the remotes had a bad button. After several phone calls to ""customer service"" I was told I would need to send the remote back to them. At my expense of course."
3,Excellent Value but Quality?,I recently purchased a 6002PRO ssystem to install in a friends car. I used to install car electronics professionally so installation was clear and easy. The instructions manual plus a wiring diagram from the Bulldog website was very helpful. The system worked fine for 1 day and then sounded off at 5:00am for no reason and on a long drive the system sounded while driving. After that the system would no longer work so I sent it back for repair by Bulldog and they do not pay for shipping to them.They give you another remote worth $20.00 for your trouble and time. So I wonder if the Quality is poor on their systems or am I just the lucky one person out of a thousand. I hope your luck is better than mine.
4,"Excellent price, not for rank amateurs","The 6002PRO, as indicated, is for professional installers or anyone was has slightly better than average abilities. It would help if you have the car's wiring schematic but with perserverance it can be installed without one. I installed it in a Jeep Cherokee in less than 3 hours. The only complaint I have is that it didn't come with a relay for the dome light connection. I didn't need tech support so I can't comment on that."
1,this alarm sucks,this alarm don't due bulldog justice i have always took pride in the company stand behind its product but this alarm system makes me ashame to have the logo on my car it work good for a week or two now all its good for is unlocking the doors an sometimes it doesnt even do that it took a long time to hook up and the end result is you feel no safer than before you installed it. its better to leave your keys in your car with a sign thats says steal or protected by bull dog alarm what joke they even use the word protected. do not buy unless you just want and alarm that beeps not protect
3,Not Bad,"Item was as advertised, its wiring was not quite up to snuf. The car did not match their wiring diagram"
4,"6002pro Simple, but great!","I put the 6002pro in my VW (i'm from germany), and it works Great! only the Remote is bad..too ""plastic""...don`t let it fall down..it will be broken!! but the alarmsystem works without any problems.But the install is only for poeple,who know something about car electric."
1,Very bad Customer Service,After buying a Bulldog alarm I lost my transmitter. I accessed their internet site and it was very plain and unfriendly. It had few options and no explanation of what to do. Their techical support telephone service is unreachable. I think Ill have to uninstall this system and buy a new one from a responsible dealer.
1,No technical support/cheap components,"I originally purchased this alarm to upgrade an existing factory GM keyless entry (no alarm) with the alarm feature. The Bulldog alarm did not allow use of the existing factory GM keyless remote to arm and disarm the system. The remotes supplied with the system had a very cheap feel to them compared to the factory GM remotes. I contacted the technical support number twice to discuss posible options to arm and disarm the system with the factory GM remotes. On two occasions, I could not contact a live person and left messages. I never did receive a call back. I was left with no option other than return the alarm and shop elsewere. I would not recommend this alarm, as there is no technical support."
3,"Revisited, Review, and More",I wanted to see On Any Sunday again but it wasn't available to rent anywhere. I'd say it's worth buying 1 of what I want rather than renting 2 time-passers. I might have skipped the 'revisited' and 'more' if I had known they were unused footage mixed with reunion interviews. I wanted a post-2K update on motorcycles and such but seeing the riders 'old' was interesting so I can't call it a total disappointment.
2,Skip this pack - just go for On Any Sunday alone - (still 5 stars),"Lost my old copy of On Any Sunday (which I'd still give 6 stars out of 5) and got this pack as the replacement. In hind sight, I really could have got away with buying just a single copy of the movie rather than these 3. The other two discs got watched once and have sat on the shelf ever since.Unless you're a reall die hard fan (and willing to over look the lack of anything even close to as imapctful as the original) hunting for some cutting room floor clips, go for the original on its own. Sorry for being harsh and echoing other reviews, but has to be said."
4,better than the movie,"While the movie succeeded in some great visual candy, it didn't do so well plotwise. All in all, the book is better than the movie. Plus, you don't have to wonder what Ashe is saying."
2,not even close......but,"While B. Schweizer has Rebecca's best interests at heart it seems to me that he is a little too PC in singing her praises. Rebecca was not an ""I'm OK, your OK"" person, and if from the great beyond she saw well meaning individuals making apologies for her she would raise hell. Still this is a must read for a true RW aficionado."
3,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I received my knives quickly (GREAT !) Upon inspection, they appeared to be 'regrinds' or that someone had switched them with a NON CMT product. Product had no marking anywhere on it, and just didnt look like a quality CMT piece. SO I returned them, no hassle - AWESOME-Ended up purchasing ""real"" CMT planer knives the following day. What's to say ? It's planer knives by one of the best blade makers in the industry. They do exactly what they were built to do, very well.In summary, Amazon may ""sell"" the product, however they may not ""fulfill"" the order. SO that means a 3rd party could do a switch on you. Amazon's cust service is Excellent as always."
5,the streamlight 75001 stinger light.,"nice flashlight very bright, like the rechageable feature at a very low price did recomend to my friends to check it out."
4,Good Light,Great flashlight only Cons is not strobe and there is a vent hole on the bottom that could get water in it.all in all well worth the money.
3,"Dated, but a good place to start for the bobcat enthusiast...","For wildlife biologists and other bobcat enthusiasts, Stanley P. Young's The Bobcat of North America is a classic. Yes, there are many more recent publications (this one was originally written in 1958). Yes, Young seems to exaggerate at times as he tells the tales of wolves and other animals (so the ""grain of salt"" approach to accepting what you read is wise counsel here). And, yes, we now have radio-telemetry, DNA analysis, and modeling techniques to give use a more complete picture of bobcat ecology.But doesn't every bobcat enthusiast have to have a copy of the classics on their bookshelf? This is it for Lynx rufus."
4,"""Little Bit of Pain"" worth the price of admission","Vanessa has never enjoyed the popularity she deserves. She and hubby's mix of electronica and vocals is one-of-a-kind, some of the dreamiest, stellar dance music around. ""Little Bit of Pain"" is one of the more delicious dance songs I can recall next to her own ""Long Tunnel of Wanting You."" A couple of cuts are threadbare for me, but still keep the mood going. For all Vanessa fans who loved ""Zipless"" and ""Slow to Burn""."
1,jvc kd-sx980,"i found the face plate for this stereo in a case on the street (don't leave things on the roof of your car, especially expensive things). After unsucessfully trying to locate the owner I am curious if you can buy the rest of it from jvc or elsewhere....anyways like the reviews of the product sounds like a decent unit but...."
5,FUNNY MOVIE,"I was fortunate enough to catch an earlier screening of this charming little gem at a film festival. Undoubtedly a labor of love - since both the male and female main characters wrote, produced, directed and acted in the film as well as everything else - it is the love shining through the laughter than keeps the film moving. The absurd coming of age storyline of Andrew is knee-jerk hilarious and showcases the range and versatility of a gifted comedic actor willing to literally do anything to get his point across. See this movie. You will laugh. You will gasp. You will grin. You will feel your heart flutter. You will find yourself remembering certain comedic bits long afterwards. And you will certainly not regret it."
1,Avoid this company's products!,"I recently installed a Model RS92. The directions that came with this remote car starter are not only hard to follow, but if you follow a certain portion of the directions, as they are depicted, you will most likely damage your vehicle's wiring. Most autos will require additional hardware to properly install these remote starters, and the directions are very poorly written. Forget trying to get in touch with them. The phone is always busy and they don't reply to e-mail. My RS92 failed out of the box, and I can't get anyone to repair/replace it. I have an Associates degree in Electrical Technology, and I still had a hard time figuring these directions out. Do yourself a favor find another manufacturer!"
1,Poor Consumer Relations,"I don't even know if my Remote Starter works because I received the installation instructions for an Alarm System 5002 Pro and haven't been able to contact anyone in the Tech Support department to clear up the mix up. I have been calling for 8 consecutive business days and the line is always busy. I have emailed without success and faxed without success. It appears they take the money and run. I guess I am on my own. Maybe the Better Business Borough would be interested in what I have to say if Bulldog is not. Their web site is blatent false advertisement. They state that you will talk to a ""live person"" (a highly skilled tech) but they neglect to mention you will be 10 years older by the time they get back to you! I believe this product is good but the company's customer care ethics ! If you are looking to purchase a remote starter, try someone who will assist you with installation!"
1,Bulldog RS92 Remote Car Satrter,"After installing the RS92 in a 1999 cavalier I found that it will not work unless you order part #721 to bypass the anti-theft system. Bulldog does not make any reference to this, nor is there technical assistance any help as they do not answer there phone and when you do leave a message they don't return your calls."
1,Bulldog rs92e No support at all.,"I also ordered the T-harness, which had no usable instructions, and clips which did not appear to plug into the other modules. The wires were not identified. The instructions for the parking light output were so incoherent as to be unusable. The manual is the worst I've ever seen. (I work as a maintenance technician in an automated facility). I have been calling the ""support"" # for 5 days. I have sent E-mail after E-mail requesting more info, No response at all. Now my dash is still unassembled with the unit halfway installed. One more day, and it goes back to them! I would strongly advise against this unit, at least for the 96 dodge cars."
4,RS92 Easy to Istall and Life time guarantee,"The best of this RS92 is easy to install,to me works fine.I been doing it for 3 years and I have no problem it all, the good thing of RS92 is all ralays external,never fails.If you are looking just for remote starter I recomed the RS92."
2,Remote starter,"I purchase this remote starter back in 2008.After few months sitting unde my bed i made my mind to install this stuff which i pay an fair price for.As far as performance i wouldn't lie to you,it's not the best choice out there....The remote doesn't have that frecuency range needed to compete with its closest competitor.Many times i go to crank up twice or more to get the engine started at close distance ( 4 feets ).I have no idea if the remote has issues,but after many times trying to figured out why i couldn't find any thing.At the bottom end of this review all i can say is steer away from cheapo remote starters"
3,"Good read, if a little fanciful!","Good read, well written in an historically accurate setting. I enjoyed the book and the story very much."
2,Fictional history,"Despite the stellar reviews, I must say that I did not care for ""I, Mona Lisa"". I do occasionally enjoy historical fiction, but this story was more of a fictional history. If you enjoy learning a new tidbit from historical fiction or getting a feel for a time period through vivid, detailed descriptions, this may not be the book you're seeking. As an alternative within the same genre I would recommend a Philippa Gregory novel. Ms. Gregory's characters are far more complex, her writing style more engaging and her historical descriptions far richer.However, if it's simply a good story you want, Jeanne Kalogridis does a fine job of weaving the many details of the plot into a coherent ending. In the interview with the author at the back of my copy, Ms. Kalogridis sheds some light on why she writes in the style she does. I just couldn't help but wish that she had incorporated more of her obvious knowledge and interesting observations of the Mona Lisa and Renaissance art into the novel."
3,When you are not reading your are thinking about it...,If the sign of a good read is thinking about it when you are not reading it than this book is five stars. At times this book suffered from far too much background detail; however it ended far too quickly. If you read Borgia Bride and enjoyed it (raced through it like I did) you may find I Mona Lisa less intense and powerful. Three stars.
4,Good read but GLARING error in the plot!,"I would have given this book a higher rating but for the ending. I thought this was a well written book. It had enough suspense to keep my interest throughout. In fact, I had a hard time putting the book down. However, when she reveals her final plot twist and tries to explain it, I realized that none of her explanations for why one the other characters (Mona Lisa's father) acted a certain way make sense. I cannot believe the editors of this book did not pick up on such an obvious flaw. Without giving too much away, the father took certain action because his wife was pregnant. In an attempt to create a final twist, she reveals that the wife was not pregnant until AFTER the father took those actions. Then why the heck did the dad do everything he did? It makes no sense and it simply makes the entire book fall apart.She should have left the final twist out. If she had, it would have been a GREAT book. Too bad...."
2,Beyond fiction,I enjoyed reading the book until I realized that the author let her imagination be carried away beyond fiction. There is no documentation whatsoever that Lisa was married to a Medici. Granted it is historical fiction but the most deluded narration of who her real father was (let us not spoil the plot ) is beyond any stretch of the imagination. Very disappointing indeed. There is so much licence you can take in altering history. This is beyond fiction.
3,slow start,"I usually enjoy historical fiction novels. This book started somewhat slow and took a while to develop. I think there were too many subplots going on, and felt there was a rush to tie up the ends towards the end of the novel. Overall, a good beach read but that's about it.On another note, I read this on my kindle, and can't figure out why there were so many typos and spelling errors."
2,Too slow.,I am an avid reader of historical fiction and this was one book I just couldn't get into. The premise of the book sounded very interesting to me. I started it and the novel just dragged on and on. I remember starting it and putting it down for weeks at a time - not a normal occurrence for me! I suppose this novel just wasn't for me and maybe someday I'll give it another chance.
5,Page Turner For Sure!!!,"I could not put this book down. I always wondered about the Mona Lisa, (my name sake) and reading this novel gave me the answers I have been looking for. This novel is well written with all that has the makings of an epic movie!!!"
4,Italian History Comes To Life,"I read this book just before taking a trip to Italy, and the characters and locations really came alive for me on the visit. The book is educational regarding the DeMedici family and what it was like to live in that time period as well as an engrossing fictionl account of the woman who sat for the famous portrait."
2,"Very poor quality, but the kids love them","I ordered these even after reading the negative reviews because my grandkids are obsessed with Pokemon. They were very poorly packaged and are very, very poor quality. The kids found them before I could ship them back and love them. The problem, they have been playing with them about an hour and 1 is already broken."
5,8 year old daughter likes it,"My 8 year old daughter likes them. I'm happy because we received quickly and all was in tact. A piece has already broken off from one of the figurines, but that's cause they are fairly fragile. Overall we're happy."
3,Pokeman Pikachu,They are small and haven't seen my Grandson play with them at all.... he probably lost them
3,It was ok,"I liked the fact that this item had three pikachu's from the original Pokemon, but the paint job on them was very poor. This would've received 5 stars if the paint had not been so sloppy."
2,Very cheap made,"Sorry to say its very cheap made, but my daughter loves them so I would keep them but not buy these again."
2,Description Not Clear,"Read more carefully than I did! Based on the image of six different colors, I thought I would receive two each of six different colors which would be six different ""sizes."" Instead I received 12 picks in one color and one size. I still do not see a specific size in the description of this item, as is listed with other picks. It does say there are different sizes, but I thought that meant the package of 12 would include the different sizes."
1,Don't buy unless you still are using Windows 95,"I thought I could run this on XP but even when you go to applications and have it simulate 95, it won't run. Bummer. Total waste of money. Ratings don't count because I cannot run the game."
5,Superior Taste,"Well, of course you don't want to pay shipping for a 12-pack of soft drinks from the omnipresent Gristedes. However, if you're lucky ebough to live in New York, or your local store has this, by all means get the diet black cherry flavor. This was so sweet and rich in cherry flavor, that I immediately checked out the bottle from which I was drinking--I thought I had bought the Non-Diet version! They're just aren't too many diet soft drinks that taste this good. Note: Boylan's diet drinks use Splenda sweeterner, so if that's a turn-off, skip it (or splurge and go for the non-diet!) It's especially good cold, some ice cubes will help mask the lack of sugar.Boylan Bottleworks (gotta love that proletarian name!) is the real thing. They've been around since 1891 with the launch of their ""Birch Beer,"" and expansion into othr award-winning beverages. (For more soda lore, see Boylanbottling.com.)"
2,Not for Windows Vista or 7,"Apparently Windows Vista and 7 do some polling on the USB bus during boot up that randomly causes this UPS to completely shutdown. You have to physically switch the power on and off at the UPS. The only workaround is to unplug the USB cable form the UPS during reboots. Aside from this the UPS seems pretty good, it's protected my PC through a couple short outages so far. NOT RECOMMENDED Windows 7 or Vista users."
4,For The Baseball Fanatic,"Although I haven't got the DVD yet Field Of Dreams would have to be costner's best movie yet as this brilliant adaption comes to life, with a great supporting cast including: James Earl Jones & Ray Liotta this is a must see... As for the love of the game it is O.K. costner does a feeble attempt at reviving the magic of Field of dreamsbut it doesn't pay off-It comes with the DVD so it is worth watching at least once."
2,good design but cheap maybe good for camping?,I put it together pretty quickly and easily by I knew it wasn't what I had hoped for pretty soon into the process.the material for the hammock is low quality and while the tubing snaps in place when joined it still didn't feel substantial . I was worried that it would collapse under my weight.
4,Nice hammock,"This is a decent hammock for the price, not the sturdiest one but it does the job and easy to put together. I would recommend this however if you have the extra money buy a better one."
1,Hammock,It is cheap and has already ripped :( I would not buy this. It is to much trouble to send it back.
3,Hammok That Does Not Swing,I was hopping to get a hammok that swings but this one is still and the fabric is not that strong and I'm afraid to stay on it for long.
3,"Product is okay, getting the product was a hassle!","Did not receive the item for 3 weeks,when it came there were major parts missing.Eventually Amazon rectified the issues, but overall wasn't worth it!"
1,Texsport Hammock,"While hammock and stand were received extremely promptly, the box had been damaged and taped then put inside an Amazon box. Two parts appeared to be a different shade from the rest of the pieces. Some pieces had scratch marks. Some pieces were not plastic wrapped. Product appeared to have been returned. Actual hammock appeared to be cotton and ripped immediately. Not worth the cheap price."
4,HAMMOCK,"I'm 63 years old with many health problems. The instructions said it's better to have two people to put it together. Well, I can not stand for long or lift anything heavy, and I put it together in 15 minutes. Just perfect for us older ones. Great product!"
1,Lasted 12 hours,"My 3 year old recieved this as a Christmas gift. We aired it up and he used it about 30 mins. Then, we look over and it was deflated. So, we reinflated it again, within 20 mins it was deflated again. My son was so upset that ""Santa's"" gift was not working. I returned it today."
5,Kids love this toy!,I bought this for my niece. She loves and and I had to buy her little brother one too as they fought over it. Do they make these in adult sizes?
4,Fun and cute!,Kids love this bouncing ball. It would not be good for a large kid as it is very small.
2,Good idea but terrible quality,"I like this product for its idea, but the quality of it is terrible the door is very flimsy along with the mesh screen sides. I am not so sure its going to last more than one summer. I have one to two fire a week and the door and sides are warping from the heat. I have only had this product a few weeks. Overall I am happy with it I just wish it was made alittle better. I like how it has the draw to collect the ash"
1,JUNK,"First off, a little info about myself. I hate buyer regret. I do very thorough research on any product/service in every effort to make an informed decision prior to pulling the trigger. Unfortunately, even the most diligent research is not a 100% GUARENTEE.Now, lets just cut to the chase -The good - easy to assemble and looked nice prior to use.The bad - terrible quality. After one use, one of the spot welds that holds the door hinges snapped off. All the poor quality mesh has warped under the heat. Finally, the so called powder coated finish did nothing and the entire unit is completely rusty after a few weeks outside. Oh, and it sucks to move it. The design makes it very hard to move with one person.Final thought - thumbs down, grade F, look elsewhere for your firepit."
1,Don't Bother,"We used this fireplace one time and are ready to send it back. Looks nice enough when it's put together, but after one fire, the finish is already peeling off in several spots, the top is rusted, the ash tray is sagging and the inside grate is warped. Save your money and don't buy this product."
3,If you are looking for old-fashioned action...,"There's action on every page of this comic book with Tintin battling Russian bad guys and trying to get out of prison and getting shot and being dragged behind a horse and crashing in a plane, always with his dog to help him get out of the next pickle.Tintin, a reporter for Le Petit Vingtieme, along with his companion dog, Snowy, is off to the Soviet Union for a story.Everyone in the Soviet Union seems to want to kill Tintin and he, like many cartoon characters, dies a hundred times, but, also like many cartoon characters, is always able to shake off death and live to fight another day.Very fun."
5,Unique addition,"I am a lifelong fan of Tintin and just added this to my collection. Surprisingly, it is all black and white but is still charming."
2,Not at all great but a must-have for a collector,"this was herge's first tintin. it's in b&w and very crude. the story is only so-so and expresses extreme bias against the soviets at that time, so if you're looking for a good read don't buy this book. it's a far far cry from his later works in everything from style to storyline. i'm keeping this just for my collection."
3,Tintin's first book tell it like it was about USSR,"This is Tintin's first book. Herge must have been about 20 when he wrote it, and the drawings as well as the plot are very rough. But, let's grant Herge this: this book was ridiculed for years for its anticommunism, yet after the fall of the Soviet Union, we have learn without doubts about the brutality of the Soviet regime. Tintin tell it like it was."
4,Old school classic.,"This is all in black and white, and printed on regular paper not the supper glossy kind. It's a good story and classic Tintin."
3,An Indication of Great things to come....,"It is the first ever Tintin book, so it has historical importance. The story is fast paced and holds your interest. The illustrations are more free flowing, almost newspaper strip type, unlike the more controlled and definitive illustrations of the later books. It is much better than the second book.. Tintin in the Congo. But it does show glimpses of great things to come - there is adventure, action and a touch of humour. For a casual reader this book might not hold great interest, but for collectors, it is. I would like to add here, that it is unlike the books that followed this book is in Black and White like ""Congo"" and is published the way it first appeared. Amd it definitely is an indication of greater things that Herge had in store for Tintin."
3,"Good gameplay, could be harder","I bought the first Army Men 3D first thing after it hit the market. The graphics weren't the most refined, but I loved the gameplay. This newer version, Air Attack isn't the same type of game. If you didn't like the first one, you may like this, and vice versa. Now you're piloting various helicopters through missions. Why is there no difficulty setting? I cruised through the first 12 or so missions RIGHT AWAY! There are a couple tough ones, and the last one is a challenge. The graphics and movement is terrific. I only wish my money was spent on something that would challenge me more than one night."
3,Army Men Air Attack,"Exciting, but not a challenging game. Quite a let down versus the original Army Men game. Not an avid game player and I finished the entire game in one week. Good game...fun to play, but seems like the game was rushed to market."
5,Even if you don't like little plastic men....,"Even though you don't like little green plastic men, this game is a very big WANT! You can play 2 player co-op and that makes it a lot funner. You can pick things up with your helos and drop them on the tan forces. There's cherry bombs, paper airplanes, apples, etc. I highly recommend this game. The control is great, same with the graphics. This is the best of the best of the Army Men games! Highly recommended."
3,air is fun but army men should keep thier feet on the ground,This game was fun but really easy I rented it and beat in two days .Some missions are hard till you find out what to do then it's simple till the last level that will take you a few trys .Cooperative multi player is fun but Vs. is not. Over all I liked playin on the ground in Army men 3D better.
2,"Meh, it's not very good...","I played this game 2 years ago and found it to be quite disappointing. I was a massive fan of the first ""Army Men"" game that came out and that was definitely a very cool game. ""Army Men: Air Attack"" has arguably worse graphics than the first game and the gameplay is often problematic.It was cool to play a game with helicopters and army men, but the game is so short that you'll be done in less than a day if you play it non-stop. Look, the bottom line is that this game is just too short, too easy and is clearly based for younger kiddies, so I guess for a 16 or 18 year old this game is just a piece of piss.So get it for your kids if you like, but there are many newer, longer and more stimulating games out there, even for young ones. I guess that if I were a kid I'd give the game 7/10, but since I'm older I give it 3 stars. Just look elsewhere if you're above the age of 10, trust me..."
2,a decent game,this game was kind of fun but it is ment more for kids but it is fun just a little silly
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,This is one of the worst game's I have played in my life.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It looks like it like it would be a fun game right?Saten takes many forms.This game is sooooo boreing.3DO screwed up.It is my bad luck that 1 is the least number of stars I could give it.This game totally sucks.
2,OK!,"I have had this cd player for a while now, It's missing a pause button. This get rather annoying when in my past cd players they have all had them, just wanna reach down to it and find a pause button. Its ok, This is one of the best cd's i have had, but my brother has something for the same quality at less of a prices. Its ok if u want to buy it, maybe a diff. color though."
4,there IS a pause button,"the reviews submitted by others are in part, inaccurate. there is a ""pause"" button. however, it is not it's own button. you must press the stop button. to commence, press play, and the music will pick up where it left off - just like it would with a pause button. i love this cd player - especially for such a great price."
3,Long lasting...,"Put under some abuse, mine still lasted for two years without skipping. As with all the Sony cd players, the headphone jacks seem to give up easily and stop working (as with my previos cd players and my sister's)."
5,Great DVD,"This is a fantastic DVD to give out to people, to work through as a small group of friends, or to have as a reference to pull out when tough questions arise. I really enjoyed all the questions about God that are answered in it, and the Jesus movie being on there is an awesome bonus."
3,Jesus - Fact or Fictioin DVD,"It's not really ""bad"" I would say but if you have, to say the least a semi-good understanding of the bible then this dvd is not for you. I was expecting a little more depth to the answers and maybe some interesting facts from history or archaeology and its pretty well a click question, they answer and then click your next question and they answer. Most questions take less than 1 min to answer.If you know someone or you yourself haven't really done any deep study of the bible and its claims for authenticity or reliability then this a good a dvd as it'll point you in the right direction and give you some good starting points."
3,"Best field gudie to grasses in East, Midwest.","I am a prairie biologist. I find this book to be the best in helping botanical amateurs (and some experts) identify common grasses. Use it only to find the species of a grass, not its ecology. Grasses are hard to identify. This book helps alot."
4,Good for Beginners,"This has got to be best ""first book"" generally available for anyone with the least passing interest in wild plants to buy and use to discover the spectacular world of sedges and rushes, as well as grasses, especially if you are thinking about looking more carefully at wild plants in the northeast. It marked--and sparked-- the very beginning of my own personal interest in botany, guided my first field trips into the New Jersey Pine Barrens, led me to a botanical club and courses in sedge identification, and ultimately opened up the world of botany to me. I was so excited I wanted to call the author and thank her for writing this book."
3,Identification guide to Northeastern species,Introduction to grasses in the Northeast USA.Most descriptive pictures are of flowers only that are good for identification purposes but of limited usefullness of how the grass typically grows. How the grass fits into the larger ecosystem is not includedIdentification drawings lead you to pages where you are likely to find the full description.
3,Grasses,I am dissapointed that it did not tell me the region that this book covered before I purchased it.
1,"Misleading title, awful illustration quality","First of all, a significant number of the species covered in the book are NOT grasses, they're sedges, rushes, Cattails, etc., which isn't really noted in the description. The number of grass species covered is very disappointing. And the illustrations are poor, as others have mentioned/ The printing is often blocked up to the point that there is no fine detail visible, just a black ink blob. At least one is printed so weakly that there isn't much visible other than the stem of the grass. VERY disappointing. Looking at reviews from people who think highly of this book, I can't help but think that the printing quality varies greatly from copy to copy, because I don't see how anyone could find the illustrations very useful."
3,Understanding of Icons - Art & Religion,"Linette Martin an Anglican artist has written a very good book for artists and a satisfactory book for those who are trying to understand icons from a religious perspective.This is a very detailed art book which explains how the icon artists approached their work. Ms. Martin ties the art techniques of icons with what she believes are the religious view point of the icon painters.If you are a searcher, one who is looking to convert to the Eastern Church, one who is trying to understand the mystical roles of icons in the religious life of Orthodox Christians, then this book will in my opinion not meet your needs.This is not an easy read. I would say that this book is more of an advanced guide to icons, not a beginner's book, for one who is just starting to investigate Orthodox Christianity.If you are an artist, trying to expand your knowledge of this religious art form, then I can highly recommend this work."
3,Is a 3 year life reasonable?,Purchased in July 2009 (now Late October 2012) - With very little usage and being left outside almost constantly in North Carolina Mountains should we only get 3 1/2 years before the cords fray and break? This seems to be less than what I would have expected. I tried to get on it today - noticed frayed cords and wound up on the ground when I tried to get in anyway.
2,Hammock Failure,"I purchased this item in August of 2008 and much to my surprise it split and came apart this year (6/2011). I did not leave it out in the weather, at the end of the summer I would roll it up and store it in the garage. So to my point of view it should have lasted a lot longer than two years."
1,Wooden Bar Snapped,I had the hammock for only a month before it broke. The wooden bar snapped in half about 30 seconds after sitting on it one evening. I weigh 150 lbs. Luckily I had it set up close to the ground so I didn't fracture anything. Am ordering another one hoping it was an isolated incident with a defect in the wood. Am a little nervous though.
1,Amazon sent me a ripped hammock!!!!!!,"I was so bummed! Thin cheap fabric. Do not order unless you want a junky hammock.The package had already been opened & returned! I am disappointed in Amazon for not even bothering to check the hammock.I order a lot of things from Amazon, but this is the first time I have been hugely disappointed with them."
3,"Comfortable, but not very pretty","This hammock came in green, although it is pictured only in blue and nowhere did it say that it was coming in green. That was annoying. It is SUPER comfortable, but, in my opinion, it's ugly. The white is VERY white, so I can only imagine how it's going to look in a few months. When you get on it, you have to make sure to dust off your feet!"
2,Customer Service does not return calls,I called Texsport and left a message with a Customer Service representative. I have yet to receive a return call. The rope from the chain to the hammock broke when I sat on the hammock with my one year old grandaiughter. I have had the hammock since April. It has only been used occasionally. All I wanted was a replacement rope.
4,Great for the price,"This is a nice hammock. A good size. Colors are nice and vivid, i.e., not faded. It appears to be good quality. I only recently bought it, but it weathered a pretty hard rain/thunderstorm and still looks like new. It's definitely not as thick or plush (or large) as a hammock that you might pay $200 for, but for $50 it's a good deal. We use it as a tree hammock. If you're looking for a decent, inexpensive hammock, this is for you."
5,Queen B,"Oh, what a luxury this beautiful hammock is! It is much more comfortable than my old rope hammock. Someone should make a cover for it, I'd buy that, too!"
4,Enjoying it on a regular basis...,"The hammock is really nice, the quilting is very comfortable. The only trouble I have with it is that the fabric was really contracted when i opened it up, I've been working on stretching it out and re-adjusting the chains. But I'm getting a ton of use out of it in this lovely late Colorado summer."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I read the reviews and ordered this hammock. I'd read it took a few days to break-in, but I've had it a month, and it remained as tippy as the day it arrived. Although the fabric was nice, and it appeared to be well made, it was simply miserable to lay on it and feel as though you could tip over at any time. We tried it at a varity of tensions, and the problem remained the same. I can't tell you how many people ended up in the garden unintentionally. I finally faced reality, dumped this hammock, and got one from Hammocks Rada which isn't tippy at all. This was a waste of money, and precious summer days."
5,Relaxing in my New Hammock,"I purchased this Hammock to take with me when I go up to the lake and do my ""Camp-Ground Hosting"" job all last summer. I set it up and took some very good naps during the long lazy afternoons, when I could. It was wonderful to also just lay in and relax during my off time. I would buy it again."
4,Durable,"Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Sturdy construction, soft and worth the money. Would buy again from this company."
3,Great hammock for price,So far so good. I don' t really like how thick it is as we leave it out in the elements and when it rains it gets really logged down but it is a great hammock and a good price and we would purchase again.
1,What we received was very poor quality,"We ordered this in Late July 2012 and sent it back the day after we received it. We never mounted it. The unit we received had very poor stitching quality including a stitched fold that should not even been there. It had two small stains also and had obviously been returned before. If stitching had been done even reasonably well, we may have tried the unit. Others may have received better units but not the one we got. This is my first review ever!"
4,Nice big hammock,This hammock is nice and big however beware that it gets VERY hot during the middle of the day. We had to use it at night or lay towels on it.
5,"Comfortable, cozy hammock","This hammock provides great support, is cushioned and big enough for two. I bought it for my husband, but I think it's really for the both of us! I highly recommend it!"
3,Wasn't what I was hoping for...,"Had a ""rope"" hammock prior to purchasing this one and loved it! While I thought this type of hammock would be more comfortable, it isn't. It gets VERY hot in the summer sun and, during windy days, I can always expect to look outside and it's flipped upside down on the ground. I will definitely go back to my ""rope"" hammock when I purchase another one - don't think I can go thru another Texas summer with this one!"
1,pure junk!,Last exactly 18 months before the sun killed it. The fabric began to rip all over the place. They use junk/cheap fabric that cannot stand up to the sun (imagine that knwing it's used outdoors). SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE.
1,Cheaply constructed.,"After spending about $50, I was disappointed to see the flimsy ropes that were used to construct the product. It appears that at least one of the ropes is starting to frazzle after 2 hours of use. Additionally, the thickness of the rope is extremely limited which leaves me to assume that this product will not last very long."
5,Great!!!!!!,I love this flatware pattern. I had a set and I was so happy to find them on Amazon so that I could add to it.
5,Midnight Soul,"My reason for getting this CD was for the hard to find, ""Lovers and Friends"" by Carl Anderson and Gloria Loring, Robin Thicke's Mom"
5,Love!,My 3 1/2 year old grand-daughter loves this collection. She sings along with each one. I highly recommend this purchase!
2,Not upbeat or child-like enough,Songs do not emit a jump up and go response from my children. The arrangements are really boring.
2,buyer beware,"If you are into the old childrens songs from the 50's, 60's, and 70's (you know the ones: they were played by your kindergarten teacher on a record player)- then this set of 4 disks are for you. Personally, I was hoping for something a little more modern. These all sound like they were recorded directly from a 45LP. Not the highest quality."
3,Favorites,"101 Toddler FavoritesI purchased 101 Toddler Favorites because it had all the songs I remembered as a child and didn't want to have to buy lots of different CD's, just got these 4 CD's all together. The songs are okay, but most are not upbeat like I would think children songs should be. I have also noticed a couple of songs get cut off in the middle. My twins tend to fall asleep every time I put a CD on and this doesn't happen with other CD's. Overall I like it and may recommend to other parents."
2,Can't find a traditional children's song CD ANYWHERE!!!!,"Song-wise, this looks like the perfect children's CD with all the traditional favorites. But the ""various artists"" tag is, unfortunately, misleading. One (or maybe two) women sing nearly all the songs, with a child singing a couple, I think.why is it SO hard to find a CD with traditional children's classics (Old Macdonald, Bingo, etc.) all performed by different artists AND not ""jazzed up"" or with a full-kit band? It's for my 3-month-old, for crise-sakes!!!!"
4,101 Toddler Favourites,This is a great product but it will be excellent if it is a DVD (pictures with lyrics) so the kids can learn to sing and also see the word while singing along.
5,Great buy!,I couldn't believe how many cd's and songs come with this collection. It includes all of the fun childhood songs.
4,Quick read during naps,"As a stay-at-home mom, I found that much of her book rang true. The title is a little misleading if you are looking for serious recommendations to make the most of being a full time mom at home, but the book delivers a lot of laughs while the little ones are taking a nap."
3,"Hilarious, but not quite","This book was really funny! It is comedic relief for the stay-at-home mom. I was looking for some practical advice and some tricks to survive staying at home and unfortunately this book did not provide what I was looking for, but hilarious nonetheless!"
2,Not funny at all!,"I purchased this book thinking that it would be interesting and humorous as I start my new career as a stay-at-home mom, however, I am returning it. The humor really stereotypes stay at home moms. I read a couple of chapters and just couldn't take anymore of it. It was actually disturbing. To me, it wasn't worth the money. If you're looking for a book that will guide you through your transition from career to SAHM, this will not be the right book."
5,I just LOVE this thing!,"I was looking for a LONG time for a good grater. I used to use my food processor, but what a mess! I purchased this one and WOW! Easy to use, sturdy, FAST cleanup (you can just toss it in the dish washer) and it looks great!"
3,Curved sides are a very bad idea,"Form over function describes this very attractive and well built grater. My $7 generic grater worked great for years. The curved sides on this grater are very annoying and turn a great product into a nuisance. I am very surprised that more people don't consider this a problem. Maybe it's only a problem with the 2-pound blocks of cheese I buy. Also, when the bottom rubber ring is removed it revels some cost cutting design."
1,Looks great but doesn't work,"Well, about the only good thing I can say for this is that it does look nice. However it is most certainly not worth the price in that it does not grate well at all. I mainly needed something to grate cheese with and all I get with this are crumbles. The box is difficult to attach and does NOT stay on securely. As other reviewers have noted, the little rubber edge at the bottom tends to collect crumbs and is difficult to clean. I had much better results with a cheap $2.00 grater from the grocery store. This thing is headed for the trash today and I am off to the grocery store to buy something that is at least useful."
2,"seems like the perfect grater, but delivered defective.","my unit was delivered bent so it will go back. box was not damaged, so it was not shipping issue.tired of all the defective products delivered from amazon. is it just me?"
1,DO NOT BUY IT !,Bought this based on name and reviews. Obviously neither is worth crap! Unit is made in china. Unit us un usable. Grater should grate not pulverize. Holes were unfinished and heavily burred. Stick to American made Quality. Do not buy KitchenAid.
4,It's Red,I like this product because it's red to match my kitchen. I don't think it's any better or worse than similar items of other brand names. IT works well enough to suit my purpose.
5,Swiss Army Knife of Cheese Graters,"I used this funnerific power tool at my cousin's wedding. I loved it so much, I just had to buy 7. I loved the storage pack because I could keep ice in it. My wife has OCD,so every thing in the kitchen is spray-painted blue, but it still works wonderfully, unlike my past ones."
2,Attractive & well functioning grater with a couple drawbacks,"This grater looks great and works really well. I'm a big fan of the containter that fits in the bottom to collect whatever it is that you're grating!However, due to a couple of issues, I will most likey not be keeping it.The rubber piece at the base of the grater collects cheese/veggies, etc. I have to remove the piece entirely after every use to clean it and it can be somewhat tricky to get back on.I ran this through the dishwasher one time, when it came out, the handle was full of water, even though the item is supposed to be dishwasher safe. Most of the water drained out, but I don't like the idea of old water being left in the handle."
5,I love this grater!,"This is the best grater I've ever used. It's considerably larger than many other box graters, which I find makes it easier to hold onto; it's also a bit heavier than others. The rubber gasket around the bottom keeps it from sliding around. The only thing I don't like is that if you use the tub, it will slide, so I save the tub for storage. The grater is too big for my gadget drawer, but it's so attractive I don't mind leaving it out on a shelf."
2,"Too big, bottom rubber comes off","The bottom rubber comes off but is difficult to put it back on. And it is too big to handle. I wish I never bought it but I hate the red tape of returning, and some places make it so difficult to return items, I just kept it. Don't like it."
2,Messy and hard to handle,"I thought this would be great to have around the kitchen but I was really disappointed from the first time we used it.Trying to grate cheese for pasta, even with the built-in container attached, I ended up having to put the whole contraption on a plate to avoid covering my entire work space in cheese. My boyfriend and I both found this grater to be clumsy (there's no way to grate on a slant, so half of the food ends up inside the grater as desired, but the rest ends up either on the counter or elsewhere) and lacking any benefit to justify the storage space it takes up. We're returning it and will be on the lookout for something more manageable."
5,great shredder for low price,"I use this shredder about once a week. This shredder is great. The sides are sharp so it makes shredding easy. I was afraid that it was going to rust but I've had it almost a year and no rust! And, it's still as sharp as ever."
2,Hard to use and Hard to clean,"I bought this because of the good reviews it has on here. But when I receive the product, first of all, it is huge. Because it is so big that it's really hard to hold it when you are trying to grade cheese into your dish. The only surface i use is the tiniest one. The other surfaces produce way too thin strips or pieces. For example, you can use it to cut potatoes into thin round pieces nor thin strips. Overal, I am kinda disappointed."
4,Good grater,"My roommate in college had this grater and when I moved into my own house, I ordered the exact same one. I love the storage container that comes with it and the size of this grater is ideal. I wash it in the dishwasher with no issues."
4,Sturdy!,"Finally a box grater that is comfortable to grip and doesn't feel like its going to collapse under my hand when I use it.The little tupperware-ish insert is nice as well. It keeps a few servings of Parmesan handy in my fridge for pizza or salad, which is primarily what I use the grater for."
2,Disappointing,"Although the premise is great, the application is not. When I bought this several years ago, I thought it was the perfect grater: didn't rust, nice handle, sturdy, sharp and -- best of all -- came with a compact container stored inside into which most of the gratings would land. It's been used almost exclusively for occasional sharp cheese grating and storage -- I use a food processor for cabbage, carrots, etc. Yesterday I looked around the inside of the white plastic seal along the bottom edge (that helps stabilize the grater on the counter or when it is on top of the container and also retains the container stored inside), and it was black with mold. I pulled it off with the hope of cleaning it well with bleach. When I used it today, I noticed a large crack in the plastic handle where it attaches to the grater.This grater has never been in the dishwasher. It's always been gently hand washed and properly stored. I expected this to last a lifetime, but I guess I've outlived it."
2,Not as good as I expected based on the reviews,"I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon and found it underwhelming. First, the cheese flies everywhere - it does not stay contained within the grater. It is big and somewhat clunky and not that easy to use. After spending twice what I saw other graters for this thing basically sits in our cabinet not being used."
3,Sloppy shredder,This shredder comes with a handy little box to catch the items you shred on the inside. Problem is the side is beveled out and about 1/4 of the item you shred falls on the outside of the shredder. I only use the box for storage and shred onto a flexible cutting board.
5,King of box graters,"This is the best box grater I've ever used. Very sturdy, great handle. Love the extra width at the bottom for more stability. The plastic container is just a bonus. So glad I bought it for both myself and as a gift for someone else too!"
4,CHEESE GRATER,LIKE IT ALOT. GREAT THAT IT DOESN'T SLIP WHEN I GRATE!I DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FOR A STORAGE CONTAINER FOR THE CHEESE IT IS ALWAYS THERE. WISH I WOULD'VE GOTTEN IT SOONER.
5,KitchenAid KG300 Box Grater - Purple,This a sturdy grater and I love the size. Mine also came with a plastic container and lid that holds the grated cheese for storage.
3,ehhhhh,"It's ok, not loving it. Smells ok but not fantastic. I think it depends on what smell you are looking for."
5,Memories....,"Having lived in France for over four years, the aroma of d'Armenie brings back warm memories. These little paper gems are so simple, easy to use, and amazingly fragrant; there is no wonder why they are a staple in almost every French Household. For anyone who is curious on WHAT exactly they are, its pretty simply equated to incense, the only difference is that they are small sheets of paper that you fold into an accordion shape, place on a plate or dish, one end is lit briefly then blown out. As the paper smolders (for about 1 minute), it leaves an amazing bouquet of floral and sandel wood scents behind that linger for days. I was so thrilled when I ran across this on amazon, and at such a great value too."
2,Depends on what smell you like...,"It's just ok..depends on what smell you like..for me it smells like old old grandma's house..all i can say is it's a very ""old"" smell. And i def don't wanna give people the illusion that i was 50 yr old when they walk into my house. Besides one strip only covers the size of a bathroom or a medium bedroom. Does not work in my living room at all. Won't buy it again."
4,jackals in iron,"Well written. Interesting characters, well thought out and developed. Be prepared to back up and reread or read slowly: there is a lot of information in this book. But to those who enjoy a good historical ( medieval ) novel, this one should please. There is little of the hollywood-type gratuitous violence, but the action is vivid, especially the climactic battle of Hastings. The glossary is helpful, as are the family trees and simplified period maps. The book has some flaws, but none of them are of major importance. Taken altogether it is a good piece of work for a first book."
5,"UNIQUE, MAKES YOUR EYES POP","I was very skeptical when I heard the rather outlandish claims being made about this book. A ""revolutionary"" way of reading and writing? A new genre of books called ""designer books""? The book starts out innocently enough, with a small amount of black text on a mostly white background. It turns out this is just a teaser, because suddenly you are splashed in the face with page after page of full color designs. It's admittedly quite a powerful mix (""marriage"", as Whodini calls it) of word and image. After a while your eyes pop. Will it really revolutionize how we read and write? Too hard to say. But it is quite an amazing piece of work."
3,great DVD,Great quality and sound. Wish it was in American format. Had to have a tech friend convert it to US
2,Mike Oldfield DVD,"I would have liked to have known in advance that this DVD could not be played on a U.S. DVD player. Could it have killed you folks at Amazon to put some obvious disclaimers to the rest of us with a U.S.address; without having us need to understand ""region codes"" and what it means to our purchase decision. I realize that Amazon seems to be doing well but after ordering kitchen canisters that cut your hand while opening, defective Motorola phones and now this, I think its time to shop elsewhere."
1,read every word,"Some where on this page they tell you that this product will not work on dvd players here in the states they will still sell it here, so be very careful"
4,Six Pound Walleye....like a letter from home,"Having lived in the city she renamed ""Rutherford"" for more than 30 years, it was like a letter from home. I could visulize the locations and the buildings described. I even identified the town where Jake Hines lived in the old farm house. My graandson is a cop in Lake City, a real river town.Besides all that, the plot was well concieved and carried out. I enjoyed it and passed it on to my daughter who still lives there."
3,It's not the 87th Precinct,"It's not even close - geographically or literarily - to Ed McBain's fictionalized N. Y.C. Ms. Gunn's series is set in Rutherford, MN , which appears to be Rochester without Mayo (Clinic.) This is the first of this series I have read & it is merely ""OK."" I get the impression that Gunn is pandering to Howard Mohr's ""How to Talk Minnesotan"" and the Coen Bros. ""Fargo"" crowd, both of which are far better & more worth the time than this imitation. For cold climate crime-solving, I recommend instead Steve Hamilton's Alex McKnight series (U.P. MI) or Kathleen Taylor's Tory Bauer (S.D.)"
3,Steering wheel cover,Had I never owned one I would say I love it however my lady was replacing an existing redskins cover that only lasted 1.5 yr in my truck.
5,Looks Great!,"Looks great on the steering wheel. Covers up all the wear and tear. It was a little difficult to put on. It requires a bit of muscle so if you're not up to the task, find someone to help."
1,not a good buy,"I purchased this set about a month ago, since our previous flatware was 18/0, and our dishwasher left spots on it. This product claimed to be 18/10, but apparently cheaped out on the knife blades, which have spotted dreadfully. The rest of the pieces wash nicely, but the knives look so dreadful I would be ashamed to let anyone see them. I am going to look into returning them, which is a shame because the set is beautiful."
1,Warning: Not what you think it is.,"I purchased this two DVD set thinking it contained ""The Battle of Britain"" and ""The Dam Busters"", two movies about the RAF in WWII. This was an incorrect assumption - neither of those movies is available on DVD.This set consists of two short documentaries. The Dam Busters Raid is actually fairly interesting, and covers the Ruhr dam raids, and the development of the bombs that were used. It's a pretty good look at the subject.The Battle of Britain is mostly about the Spitfire, and its development, rather than the actual battle. A lot of the running time is taken up with footage of the air show commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Nifty if you want to watch footage of 50 years of RAF planes zooming around to music with little commentary, but otherwise just filler."
3,Dam Busters and BOB available,A previous reviewer mentioned that the Dam Busters and Battle of Britain movies are not available. The Battle of Britain is available domestically. The Dam Busters is available via the Amazon.UK WEB site (I purchased it along with a number of other great Brit WW2 movies - The British DVD War Collection is particularly good). You must set your region code on your DVD equipment to read European DVDs. My solution was to set my PC DVD drive to read the European regional code. Both of these documentaties listed on Amazon (US) are OK as well.
2,"It was okay - that's all, just okay","Eurocentric, of course. Titilating, sure. Accurate, not so much. Needed a fact-checker (editor should have cought some more obvious errors) and it seems to me that the author puts a 21st century filter on what she reports.For instance, she talks of 'mounds of flesh' on plump women as though it were repulsive in a time when we can see from the protraits done of women celebrated for their beauty that beauty often came in soft packages.Not really done from the feminist perspective and not as accurate as i'd like, but it passed the time on public transportation and for that I'm grateful."
4,Good Lord -- A Compelling Tale of Wild Goings On,"Ms. Herman captures the tone of this book perfectly -- whimsically recounting the intrigues, romances, love and horror stories over 900 years of Royal contretemps, across the imperial courts of Spain, Europe, England and Russia.I found this book to be thoroughly enjoyable -- a quick, engaging, and carefully researched look at the sometimes incredible lives of the royals. The queens had their work cut out for them, what with various impediments, sexual and otherwise, placed in their way to a fulfilling love life. These kings were a bunch of losers, for the most part, though the queens weren't always so hot either."
4,Worth it (however...)!,"This is a delicious and oftentimes informative read. However, the back of the paperback edition deems the book ""impeccably researched."" I think any serious scholar, to put it nicely, would disagree in the extreme with that statement. I was expecting new revelations and information, but the author only puts together a hodgepodge of stories compiled from secondary sources--many of which were based on speculation and rumor themselves. That said, the book overall does not disappoint in entertainment value. Some readers loyal to Princess Diana wil be taken aback by Herman's harsh portrayal of the Princess as a manipulative, mentally unstable wolf in sheep's clothing. One nice feature is the PS section at the back of the book, which has a lot about Herman's journey to becoming a best-selling author. Aspiring writers will enjoy the PS addition to the author's work."
2,Poorly researched,"While entertaining at times, this book is obviously not done by a serious historian. Most of her material is taken from secondary sources. In one chapter, the material is actual a book report, because the author only uses 1-2 sources, and constantly quotes from one. I finally sold it to a used book store, because as a history buff, I was ashamed to have it in my collection. More People Magazine than history I'm afraid."
4,Entertaining version of history,"Sex with the Queen was an entertaining journey through some of the most famous royal bedrooms in history. Covering women from Anne Boleyn to Catherine the Great to Diana Princess of Wales, Eleanor Herman brings to life the scandalous lives of royal women throughout history. Some were abused, unloved wives who just wanted to find some semblance of happiness in a world where royal females were cattle to be sold to the highest bidder. Some were not so sympathetic and at least one was completely innocent of the accusations that killed her.I enjoyed this book throughly. It was an intelligent look at the underlaying reasons for such ""scandalous"" behavior. It once again brings to light how deploringly women have been treated throughout history. It certainly has all the ingredients to make a good soap opera: sex, love, betrayal, and money. It definitely helps to make history more interesting and that is always a positive thing."
4,Extremely Satisfying...,"I bought this book with the purpose of it being a historical gossip column, and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, it greatly surpassed my expectations. This novel is very well written and contains a great deal of information, while not being stuffy. It was a very quick read and I highly recommend this novel to anyone who has a taste for reading about female royalty and history. Also highly recommend this book to anyone on a long trip, as this book is not difficult to read but will take a while."
3,"Entertaining, but historically incorrect","This book is very interesting and I am enjoying it very much. Since I am a Henry VIII buff and my favorite wife of his was Anne Boleyn, I was looking forward to that part of the book, as she was executed supposedly for adultery. However, when I got there, I was somewhat disappointed. The author said that Anne had been born in 1507, which is not true at all. Anne was born either in 1500 or 1501, according to newer and more trustworthy sources. When it talked about her execution, it said, ""She was only twenty-nine,"" elaborating that she had been killed young, when in fact Anne had been almost forty. I believe that the author chose the juicier bits and really expanded on those, sometimes getting a little out of hand. I like this book but cannot help but think how many historically incorrect facts the author has included to keep her audience hooked, going for that ""shock factor."""
4,If you like royal history...,I like this book very much and will reread sections from time to time. It is well written and very interesting.
5,John Kinsey,A refreshingly broad examination of world thought. Phillips does a fine job of tending both to the needs and dispositions of the Western reader without diluting any of the non-Western material. A nice break away from the normally Western-dominated bias found in texbooks of this sort.
5,This rocks!,"What a great feel for true to life music!!! Very strong effort from this band of music veterans. Musically and lyrically strong without being over-layered. Great grooves, sliding slashing guitars, strong vocals, well-placed harmonies. Everyone can relate to the style and experiences they put in their music. Recommended for fans of music looking for southern rock meets roots meets blues meets roadhouse meets classic rock... Hard to describe other than to say this ""buffet"" is simply tasty!"
2,Blue and Red pencils,"As teacher of Learning disabled students, I have used pencils with blue at one end and red at the other to have students mark b's and d's in their reading so that they learn the difference. I have used these for 25 years. I switched to this brand because they are less expensive. Now I know why. In trying to sharpen them initially, you lose half the pencil. The wood splinters or remains rough to the touch.Charles Leonard Inc. Pencil, Red/Blue, 12/box (65045)"
1,Do not buy these pencils,"I took my chances and did not heed the warnings that these pencils are worthless and bought a box anyway. Well, lets be fair and say half the pencil is worthless. The ""lead"" of the red half is shattered inside the pencil. Every time you sharpen it, a little piece of the red lead comes out and clogs up your pencil sharpener. I happily sharpened away until I was left with only a small blue pencil. The red part was consumed entirely just trying to get it sharpened.There are other brands of this type of pencils (Koh-I-Noor, and from jetpens.com), and I suggest you try them first.Again, do not buy this product."
5,"Charles Leonard Inc. Pencil, Red/Blue, 12/box","I use these pencils on a daily basis. The only thing I don't like about them is the lead is too big. I really need the small size lead. Other than that, they are fine. You cannot get these pencils anywhere anymore."
1,No Fun at All!,"This game was a waste of money for me because I couldn't find anything that explained how to play it. Maybe it's me--I'm an adult who likes to play computer games; so, perhaps it's an age thing. I also bought a casino game and the instructions left out one important bit of information--I finally figured it out; but this one has me baffled. I think it's another one of those situations where the games are made in a foreign country and when the instructions are translated to English, most often, important factors are lost in the translation (like the instructions for my Zenith LCD television!)."
3,They could have done a little bit better,"This game is really fun, great use of the touch screen and you can also do the DS download play and play against friends. The one major flaw is you HAVE to use your created player, there are no replacements. It also takes a while to earn new items to give your player because a shirt costs $100 and you win 20 if you get 3rd place. Other than that its a great game, I recommend it to anyone that likes golf. Please go to [...] for reviews for this game and other games too!"
4,I'm Not a Golfer!,"but, I really enjoy this game! The graphics are good and the playis right on. My only gripe is, I can't make the golfer look like me!"
4,The only drawback is the missing PGA,"Wow. What a great game on the DS. This is not the prettiest game, or the most notable. But it is FUN FUN FUN! Using the stylus to control the swing works great. Nintendo continues to innovate and change the way we play games. There are at least 15 courses. This is enough to keep anyone entertained for a long long time. There are no PGA anything in this game. But for what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun. Get this game if you have even a moderate affinity for golf."
5,"T. Gunderson, post wise","T. Gunderson: If you don't know how to run this game, don't rate it one star. Check out [...] if you have no clue on how to run it. Don't rate a gem one star.This game is marvelous, has a great cast and a good plot. Unlike many games this game has a storyline that changes upon the influences of your decisions in-game. I played it for hours and hours straight when I was younger, and re-ordered it since I lost it. Maybe it's for the memories that I have towards this saga of games, but I seriously can't rate lower than 5 stars.Eddy"
5,"Not just preaching, a lot of teaching!","I recommend that anyone who is serious about cutting back or eliminating sugar from their diet, buy this book. If you are worried about only eating chicken breast and brown rice, worry no more! The author provides many realistic solutions to keeping sugar away and offers recipies and brand names of products that are safe to eat."
5,Concise and practical,"A concise and practical handbook that is a real eye-opener, especially as it exposes sources of hidden sugars in the diet."
4,Great instrument,"My son loves this instrument, but I think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press buttons better. This one relies on the child to blow and press the keys, like a real instrument, but doesn't sound like a saxophone."
3,Cute but not very music friendly!,"This toy looks great but it is hard to get a recognizable song out of this supposedly musical toy according to the color coded music chart included. Wish they would put as much into the functionality as the styling. They dropped the ball with this and other toy instruments in the same line. Ours came in a nicely priced bundle with 2 more instruments that fell equally flat, but at least they make fun noisemakers when we are playing marching band."
2,Broke,The toy is less sturdy than it looks n I was disappointed that it broke the very next day after it arrived. The reason I couldn't return it is becoz my son threw the other half of the saxophone in the garbage which I didn't get to discover for another day . So all in all while this was a great toy while it lasted- but I would say it doesn't do justice to my 25 bucks
2,Just a plastic horn,"This is plastic, nothing spectacular about it. I would only buy it if it was an item you really didn't expect to have very long."
4,Bontempi - Saxophone,"Bought it for Grandsons 3rd birthday. He was excited because he wanted a saxophone.I put a strap on it so he can hold it and it won't drop when he's trying to put his fingerson the keys and blowing it. Eventually he'll get the hang of it.Fingering may be a little hard for a 3yr old, but its a beginning.For the price and if your child shows an interest in playing a Sax, and he's about 3yrs.I'd recommend it. I would also recommend some kind of strap."
3,Saxophone,"My son loves this sax, but the second day he had it a key broke off. This is unable to be fixed. If you glue it, it will never stay. It is attractive in color, etc., but not durable. I paid $18 after shipping and this toy will not last too long. That's a little disappointing. I've looked at several stores for a toy sax. My son loves music and instruments. I was excited when I found this, but disappointed the key broke so quickly."
4,My 3 1/2 year old loves it,"My son loves musical instruments and this was a big hit. Easy to use, and the keys actually work. Wish it came with a song book, but he is learning by ear. Lots of fun!! He went back to it all day on Christmas. Highly recommended."
4,sax,"we gave this along with the clarinet and trumpet to my 3 yr old grandson. they have all held up good and he is a typical 3 yr old, sometimes rough with his toys. he loves all of them and is catching on to how to play on them! one of them arrived not working correctly and it was immediately replaced, no cost to us. i am very satisfied and i love seeing him have so much fun and entertain us all."
1,It didn't last a week,"This was given as a gift to my son. He never banged it or sat on it or anything crazy, just played on it about 3 hours a day between other things. It lasted four days and one of the buttons now will not stay down. The notes are totally backwards from an actual saxophone or any other woodwind which I found annoying, and the fingering action is backwards too. Instead of pushing several buttons to form the correct note, the fingering is done like a piano, one note at a time, or many to form chords. When I say it is backwards, the low notes are at the top end of the instrument and low notes are at the bottom. I'm kind of glad it broke so now he can go back to his recorder which is WAY more like a real saxophone."
1,Very disappointed - broke right away,"I, too, thought I had done my homework so I was extremely disappointed when I took this sax out of the box for my son and discovered how cheaply made this toy is. It is an extremely light-weight and flimsy plastic that feels like it could ""snap"" if you held it too hard. The mouth piece broke the second time he picked it up to play with it. This will end up in the trash tomorrow and I would never buy another Bontempi instrument nor would I recommend one to anyone."
1,Saxophone,I doubt my 4 year old grandson will be able to bow enough air through it to make much music.
4,Great toddler gift!,My 3 1/2 year old loves her saxophone. Mom loves it too thanks to it's great intonation. It has a whole octave that is in tune. It's not totally realistic in that you press each button separately to play a note so you are never holding down more than one note-I am a woodwind player so perhaps I'm asking for too much : ) But it's easy to play-my one year old can make a sound if I hold the key down- and the noise it makes isn't annoying at all.
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"I thought I did my homework, I read the reviews and thought I was getting a toy sax for my 4 year old. I thought this product would be somewhat durable. I wasn't expecting real metal or anything like that. It came in the mail today and I am TERRIBLY disappointed. It is made out of the CHEAPEST plastic you can get. I am sure this is going to break with in a day of my son getting it. The plastic reminds me of the same material as those plastic easter eggs you can get. Anyway, this is not worth even a dollar in my book. I would love to send it back, but this it seems is the only toy sax out there, and my son has his heart set on getting one. I have never written a review for a product on Amazon before, but this is the biggest piece of cr*p, I felt that I needed to."
2,Not for little kids,"Both my four year old and eight year old were very excited to see this shiny piece. The toy however is hard to hold and hard to play. The kids got tired of it very quickly and went back to playing other instruments. The design of the mouthpiece appears to be too big for smaller kids to effectively use this toy. Even my older kid who plays the flute often had a hard time. You must press a key for it to play, which is a non starter and unintuitive for the little one.I would return it if I can."
3,Not their best,"The toy has good sound and the kids love it, but it isnt very tough.The key mechanisms failed after not too long and not too heavy use. The mouthpiece is also pretty easy to break off.Overall, not nearly a durable as the Bontempi trumpet, though it is ealier to blow for young kids."
5,Unique and stylish,"I am very pleased with this chandelier. The craftmanship is excellent and the styling very unique. The simplistic design works well with a variety of styles from Contemporary to Arts and Crafts. I bought it to use in my dining room because it is not a piece you will see in everyone else's home. It's styling is somewhat unexpected (i.e.: not your typical curly-armed, metal finished chandelier that you usually see in a dining room). Please be aware that this is a fairly large piece, nearly 36"" round, but again, because of its simplistic design it will fit well into most decors."
4,"CD burner broke within a year--otherwise, it's great","My CD-burner gradually began to deteriorate within a few months of buying the computer. Sometimes it would burn CDs ok, and sometimes not. It finally broke for good, right after the warranty expired! I think it's a recurring problem with this model. If anyone knows how to fix it or how to get Sony to fix it after the warranty has expired, email me at the following address (minus the spaces:) j i m w c a @ y a h o o . c o m"
5,Great Notebook,"I've had this laptop for 2 months now and it is wonderful. Very Light and very quiet, unlike what someone else had to say. My guess is he got a lemon. This notebook is just as quiet as any other I've used. The case is rock solid and made of Magnesium Alloy which weighs as much as plastic but is as strong as metal. The screen hinge covers are plastic but that's a minor problem. The 1ghz processor is spiffy and it's perfect if you need a thin light notebook."
2,Wedlock of the gods,I am disappointed with this movie. It has some interest parts but am disappointed with the director and editor of this movie. shame on them.
5,The new generation,"No commentaries!!! This album is the MAXIMum. A new kind of music, mixing hip hop, drum'n bass and rock. The best album of the year! Maxim is the real madman. Without him, Prodigy is nothing. Sorry for the mistakes, but I am brazilian."
5,Totally Captivating,"This book grabbed me in the prologue and didn't let up until the last page. Fern Michaels is one of my favorite authors and this book was just as good as her last one, About Face. I liked the idea of twins trading places and the guys they ended up with. A couple of times I laughed out loud at some of their antics. It sure held my attention all the way through. I can't imagine what book the previous reviewers read because it wasn't this one. In addition, pay attention, readers and reviewers,those reviews read alike as though the same person posted them. I am partial to animals in stories and this one had two great dogs in it. I sure wasn't disappointed in this book and can't wait for the next one."
5,Winner!!!,"I have been a long-time reader of Fern Michaels' books which I guess puts me in the category of an ""older"" reader. What I especially like about her books, including Trading Places, is that she doesn't go on and on and on for pages and pages describing sex scenes. She takes you right up to the bedroom door and let's the reader use his/her imagination. Absolutely loved Lizzie and Aggie. Always wished I had a twin to ""trade places"" with."
5,Trading Places,"One more time, Fern Michaels captivated me, Started this late at night and had to finish! Good story!"
3,Could this really happen?,"I totally agree with Stacey.I'm a newcomer to Fern Michaels, even though I've heard the name for years. Not sure if I'll become a fan. I need to read a few more of her books before I know for sure."
1,Oddly written,"I keep trying to get through this book, but it's really hard to. The characters are not believable as human beings...when the main characters talk I have to re-read it several times because it doesn't quite make sense. Things are not explained very well in the book, and the characters just go on about random thoughts and tend to ramble. Character introductions are at an all time minimum here as well. It is very hard to follow.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It is poorly written and poorly researched. The plot has holes you can drive a semi through; not to mention the poor ability to make the characters believable.Horribly written and hard to follow. Definitely not a good casual reading book at all."
2,Neither Place satisfactory,"I'm a little over half way through this and it is a chore. It was bad enough that twin sisters traded places and most of the focus is on the proxy Aggie but the proofers couldn't even keep the names straight on who this was, Aggie says, but Lizzie thinks and it is the same person. Also the man of the moments names kept switching too. And what was the point in the glitzy showgirls coming to town and taking over Aggies home? just to give Lizzie/Aggie an excuse to stay with Nathan? Give me a break. The showgirls we didn't need, but guess what? they came all the way from Las Vegas and are haveing a swinging good time with Nathan's friends, course they had to cook them a meal. I bet!"
1,2nd the Editor's touch comment.,"I didn't hate this book. I thought it did end way too quickly, but I've had that complaint with a lot of books. The thing that ruined this book for me was the complete lack of editing. On more than one occasion, the wrong name was used. I'm glad someone else noticed it. In a book where swapping identities is the point of the story, you would think someone would proofread the thing."
4,Nice book,"for everyone who is interested in creating cartoons. Great resource material for beginers and professional artists. I like this book. I'd been looking for book like this forever and I finally found it. I've read a lot of ""how to draw cartoons"" books, but this one has special place in my library. Read more about reaching your own style! ""Technical support"" for all inkers and pencilers! Respect!"
3,mediocre,"it could not find the partition i knew was there. if your MBR is fubared, it will most likely not be a help. it'll find lots of things that used to be your 'recycle bin', though."
4,"great wedge but the ""cover"" is a joke","I absolutely LOVE my wedge! I have severe reflux and have been forced to sleep in a recliner many nights b/c my last wedge was so uncomfortable. this wedge has 3 adjustable heights and it took a few nights to figure out how to sleep comfortably, but once i got it, it is great. The wedge is wide and has a concave shape that helps keep you in place. The only complaint i have is that the description of the item states it comes with a washable cover...well i think they used the word ""cover"" very loosely. It is actually like a hanky with little elastic straps and only covers the sleeping surface! It in no way contains the pieces of the wedge so when you take it off your bed to make your bed, it falls apart. The packaging states that if you want a REAL cover you can order one at additional charge but i can't find a listing for the cover anywhere on amazon. So, overall...great product, a little expensive, and super crappy ""cover""."
4,I will give them all my money...,"Doris Henson (the band) was a stranger to me until I saw their live show at The Brick in downtown Kansas City. These guys, I felt, could easily be the next ""big thing"" for indie rock. The music this band plays is music that you must listen to. The lyrics are poetic and soulful, many of which are attributed to front man Matthew Dunehoo. The music has a ""driving rock"" element that carries it from song to song. This is a very strong album. A very good choice if you were to soundtrack your life. To find out more about this band visit dorishenson.com or just buy the CD. You won't regret it."
1,Terrible Book!,"Dershowitz is a mediocre writer and a third-rate legal mind. What a shame for a Harvard ""honor"" graduate and ""distinguished professor!"" Dershowitz butchers philosophy and logic. Avoid this book at all costs."
4,Fascinating study of rights theories,"Alan Dershowitz has formulated a new theory of rights, namely that they should be thought not of coming from God or nature, but from human experience. He makes a very convincing case and I highly recommend Rights from Wrongs. Dershowitz explores in detail other theories of rights and rejects them with powerful arguments and examples.My only quibble with him is that in one foolish sentence he equates blocking abortion clinics with slavery and terrorism . Still, that's not enough to ruin an otherwise excellent book."
3,"Misleading Title, But Still A Good Book","Frank, Joe and Chet go undercover as backup drivers when Mr. Hardy asks for their help in investigating a series of hijackings of trucks from the Ortiz Trucking Company in Boston. Clues lead the boys to being secretly trapped on board a freighter bound for Atlantic Island in the Bahamas, where they make an incredible discovery in a mad scientist's laboratory. The title of the book is rather misleading because, even though the boys are trapped at sea twice during the course of the book, it is never for more than a couple of chapters. Despite this, this was a fairly good book. I've never been a huge fan of the doom-and-gloom, world-domination type plots featured in many of the paperback editions, but this story was fairly interesting and moved along at a good pace. This was a worthwhile read, which I think that most fans of the series, particularly the younger ones, would enjoy."
4,"""Exhaustive and Informative""","A.H.M. Jones' exhaustive and resourceful two-volume work on the ""Later Roman Empire,"" is a definite recommendation for anyone seeking a deeper perspective of the times, although for informal reading it is not suggested. Over three hundred years are covered elaborately in twelve-hundred pages, and also the appendix itself is roughly five-hundred pages, though much of it will not be intelligible to general readers, since much of the information in it is preserved in the original Latin. Jones' work is a fountain head of research material, broken into two parts: the first is a basic overview of the religious, political, and military conditions of the empire; and the second part, which is more bulky and detailed, is an overview of the social, economic, and administrative aspects of the empire. With this, and J.B. Bury's two-volume work on the ""Later Roman Empire,"" one may boast of holding two of the greater achievements in scholarship on this particular area of study."
1,WORTHLESS,I recently bought this calculator. Does anybody out there know how to insert the paper into the miniscule space they give you. This is a worthless product and the manual is no help at all. It might even be a decent calculator but what good is it if you can't get the paper roll to insert into the thing. POS
4,Fun little set for a cheap price,"My son (2 1/2), daughter (5), and I (34) have had a lot of fun with this inexpensive little track. Lots of head to head racing with our favorite little cars. The racing is good for one lap only. You can keep them going by re-cocking the launcher in mid-lap but it takes more effort than its worth and you miss watching your mini car race around the track. The cars that come with the set, zoom around the best. We bought a pack of 5 Vettes which look cool but crash more often and sometime don't quite make it around. We haven't quite figured out the advantage to the speed dial although some cars get around better on a slower setting. Good amount of fun for not much money."
3,I give it 3 stars but you'll give it 1 at best.,I'm not going to recommend this film. But I'm going to watch it about once every couple of years. Understand?
2,It Drags On and On.............,"The storyline is interesting. The characters have some depth. What went wrong? First of all, the movie drags on WAY too much. Second, the dubbing is atrocious (especially that nasty little girl).The head in the freezer is a great idea, and making love to it....well, that just turns my stomach (I think that was the idea, but still!)I would have to say that the only part of the movie worth watching is the last ten or fifteen minutes, when things actually start to happen. Other than that, this film is a boring, pretentious stab at horror."
5,Kill Zone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray],"Kill Zone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray] is an excellent movie, especially if you are a martial arts kind of person.Great action,story and fight seens, this movie has it all."
5,Brilliant!,"If you,like me,are an avid fan of the bubblegum rock bands of the 60s-70s you will love this book!Besides looking at classic bands like the archies,ohio express,1910 fruitgum co,boyce and hart,etc the book covers the people behind the scenes who were,literally,pulling the strings.Very revealing read.Buy this!"
3,Schrade ST1 Tough Tool,"I am impressed by the Tough Tool. Not crazy about having to open a second tool to unlock the one in use. I was saddened over Schrade selling out. I have been lucky to find some Schrade knives that were still on the shelf this Christmas that were made in the U.S.A. I will not purchase a Schrade made in China, and can not understand why anyone would get excited over the imergance of a Schrade or any other tool ""Made in China""."
2,Dont bother,"I owned a Schrade multi-tool for 10 years when they just came out. It was american made and heavy duty. The locking mechanism just broke a few weeks ago, so I ordered a new one knowing it was not made here. Big mistake, I tried to trim a guitar string the other day and it didnt even cut it. Very disappointed"
5,"""The larger picture is overrated""","Mark Salzman's The Soloist hands you a vivid perspective of living in today's world of classical music. The way he uses his own views and experiences to explore what it means to be an artist is truly inspirational. The fact that he combined an artist, juror, and teacher into one brilliant character, Renne Sundheimer, was quite impressive. The trial and members of the jury added a delicious touch by expanding the dramatic side of the novel. The time Renne spent with Kyung-hee magically dug up his past and helped him see the cello from a whole new perspective. Renne's relationship with Maria-Teresa grew to become quite spicy but quickly ended with a splash of cold water. Their relationship was pointless and reminded me of a soap opera. The last sentence of the book really sums it up, ""I'm starting to think that the larger picture is overrated."""
5,Teacher's pick,"Don't hesitate to pick up Mark Salzman's The Soloist. As an English teacher I enjoyed the allusions and thought-provoking passages. It was a mesmerizing experience to follow Renne's journey through alienation. My students found the book enjoyable and easy to read. They seemed to be eager to go on to each new chapter to solve the mysteries of Renne's problems in his personal life and with the trial. One thing of particular to note: Mr. Salzman does a great job as ""teacher"" when he artfully uses and defines musical language. Much of this may seem to be digression, but perhaps he thinks, as his main character does, that one ""shouldn't think about how it would sound to anyone else."" Overall, the book is a symphony. My class found that there are numerous messages for us in The Soloist and it is a joy to discover them."
3,Superbly....and disappointingly....realistic.,"How does a child prodigy with such a love for music go from a world class performer to a middle aged man content to play an hour a day in the dark? The story is incredibly well told--probably one of the most realistic renditions of jury duty I've ever heard--but fails to really explain what HAPPENED to this guy.The flowing, culturally infused story is periodically interrupted by the man's unfathomable attraction to a thirty-something, chain smoking woman with two husbands under her belt. The whole romantic sub-plot is about as likely--and bizarre--as the attraction millionaires have for dollar stores and flea markets."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book because it was to be discussed at a book club I am in. I didn't finish it in time for the discussion; in fact, I didn't attend that session. I found that the book did not keep my interest; if it had been a library book, I would have returned it unread. Big disappointment."
2,"It showed promise, yet ended flat.","I pushed through The Soloist, by Mark Salsman hoping for an ending that I didn't recieve. Salsman's interpretation came a lot from his own experiences as a cellist. Which makes him parachial to that view. This made Renne seem clouded and dismal, and his position in life teadious and dreary. The character development was genuine but yet laughable at times. Maria-Teresa's true blue collar nature did work wonderfully, in my view, with Renne's unending criticisim of himself. In my opinion The Soloist needs some poigant and touching moments to make it realistic. His lack of communication with others seems amazingly overplayed. The only hope throughout the entire book in my mind comes from his interest with Smokey's vet. This makes him seem human and a man with feeling. In my recomendation this isn't a book I would suggest to the reader looking for light, airy, and pleasent reading."
2,Ok if desperate,"The book, The Soloist, was a good book until the end. The plot kept you interested and it kept moving. But when you got to the end, you're left wanting more. Problems were left unsolved. This book did have its good points though. The reader can relate in some ways to the problems Mark Salzman wrote about. But the book had a few bad points also. Some readers may not see how the flashbacks have anything to do with the plot. And they might not know what the allusions in the story mean. Over all, The Soloist is an OK book if you're desperate."
3,I thought the book was dull,"I thought the Soloist by Mark Salzman was alright but it could have been better for example with the court trail it could have been alittle shorter because it got to be boring at times. Another thing that didnt seem right is that he didn't have an affair with Maria Thersa just because he didnt like the way Maria Thersa's body looked with all those flause on her I guese, and another thing that I didnt like was that his mother never let him go out and do any child things she always made him stay with all the other artist and composers, and never let him see any girls and when he tried to his mother bribed him not to see her any more. During the end of the trail was kind of weird to because he compared himself to philip Weber and I dont think it fit good in there because I thought they were totaly opisite"
3,Not quite what I expected,"The Soloist started out with much anticipation...I was on the edge waiting to see what would happen next. Through the middle of the trial, I became bored & was just ready to finish the book. As another reviewer put it, the trial was monotone & dry. I couldn't get into the trial & it bored me. The ending wasn't all that enthusing either. The rememberance of cello playing & the relationship with the young Korean boy brought me back into longing to know what was going on & to continue reading on. It stirred up emotions & rememberances of my own when I play/played music. Its great for reading when it concerns music but boring when it comes to the trial."
1,Cellist rates novel,"I found the story to be overly simplistic.The characters were disappointing stereotypes.The musical descriptions and situations were pretentious at times and nonsensical at others.As a cellist I found it comical.(Strangely enough, I read this book while on call for jury duty!)I also was surprised to learn that the author is supposed to be a cellist himself.It doesn't show in his musical writing.If you enjoy Grisham-like screenplays, you may enjoy this.I'm tired of it."
5,This is one of my favorite books.,"You don't have to be a former child prodigy or a musician to appreciate this book. It doesn't have a pat happy ending and far from being a soap opera, Reinhardt learns a lot about himself while serving on a jury--that he is a person who can stand up for what he believes is right, even in the face of the disapproval of others (which is a surprising lesson for a musician who has to seek the approval of others). It's a story about losing the life you dreamed you'd have, and coming to grips with your life as it really is--and learning that your life as it really is has its own compensations and satisfactions."
4,Charming and Delightful Novel,"This is a beautifully told story about a young man who was a very gifted cellist as a child and has lost his ability to perform. He now teaches in a college and is waiting for life to happen. When he acquires a gifted young boy as a student and is called for jury duty on a murder trial things begin to change for him. Weaving back and forth between his lessons with the boy and the trial would seem like two entirely different experiences with nothing in common. Being an extremely sensitive young man, he attains insights from both experiences that, hopefully, will lead to a more fulfilling life for him. The story is told with some humor and a great deal of insight, not only about himself but also about life and human nature."
4,Loved the book but have some qualms,"Mark Salzman writes simply and elegantly. In addition to developing the theme about the meaning of music in people's lives, he delves into the justice system, parenting, teaching, schizophrenia, and social relationships.For me this book was gripping and I had problems putting it down. My qualms? I think he could have done a better job with Buddhism. One of the major tenants of the religion is to cause no harm to any living being. I was surprised that didn't come up in the book. Also, I've sat on a jury for a murder trial and questioned some details in that theme."
4,I thought that The Soloist was an interesting piece of work.,"The Soloist by Mark Salzman was interesting in many ways. It tells how a certain musician named Renne feels when he is frustrated with his skills. The book made me want to read it even when I didn't have to. It is basically a detailed autobiographical novel about the main character ,Renne, and the way he sees life. If you want a book to read that keeps you intrigued until the end then this is the book for you. The Soloist is provocative and does not set any limits for your imagination. The book has vivid details and lets you picture everything going on within it. I liked the book and would rate it four stars. Most of the book kept me reading and only a few parts were dull in the context. The Soloist leaves the reader with a sense of fulfillment and understanding of what it is like to be a famous musician that has somehow lost his gift."
3,"Engaging if not, in the end, highly significant","Interesting enough to keep you going, if you like music, and believable enough to let you accept the many parts that feel less realistic. Prodigies do just lose it, and that's poignant. The murder is quite believable."
3,Interesting and slow.,"I feel The Soloist is a good book, because it describes what Renne went through as a child prodigy. I muddled through The Soloist hoping for an ending that was more tolerable than the beginning or the middle. It might have helped if I wasn't reading another novel for another class at the same time. The trial, a part of the plot, was rather monotone, dry, and trying. This whole book seemed dry. I felt Renne seemed rejected throughout his life. Renne's relationships were rather tedious to read about. If they would have been more energetic and vivid, maybe I could have gotten into the novel."
5,Child of Grunge,"This album kicks exactly like a rock album should kick; it's darkly seductive, and speaks to me and for me in a way the prepackaged plastic-enhanced pop tarts never could. The music is down and dirty, and the lyrics are honed sharp enough to cut to the bone.Not all of it is fabulous, but when it's good it's terrific and when it's not as good it's at least tolerable. Overall, it's just so...satisfying."
5,Awesome Album,"I Did not really like Boggy depot except for the single ""Cut you in"". But when I bought this album it blew me away. I am a huge AIC fan and this had the overtones. Pure Ear Candy. ""Give it a name"" and ""Spiderbite"" are my fav's so far. This is one of those albums where everysong is good and is a must buy."
3,Should have been an e.p.,"I was always a huge fan of AIC, and a fan of every member of the band. Unfortunately, I feel that Jerry's new CD suffers from the same problems as his first solo outing: While half the songs are amazing, the other half are nothing but filler. Jerry needs to remember that a killer riff is not the only component of a killer song. Columbia Records supposedly dropped Jerry based on his desire for ""Degredation Trip"" to be a double album. I can't disagree. After listening to the pared down version, I think an E.P. would have been more appropriate. It may have measured up with the classic AIC E.P.'s. I still think Jerry is a fantastic artist, but perhaps he needs a songwriting partner like he had in Layne. Time will only tell."
3,"Oh, Its an Import!",I had this album when I was in high school and have been looking for it ever since. I finaly found it here as an import. This album came out after the band had a lot of success with twilight zone and other tunes. The disk has about 4 good songs on it. I would consider that not a good buy since it has a total of 13 songs. When the lady smiles is the jewel of this release. Enough is Enough is the next best and you have to be the judge from there on. When the Lady smiles makes this CD worth the buy. Its a great song. Give it a try and hear some good tunes by a band that was changing there styly to a kind of techno rock. It wasn't well received but I bought it.
3,"Good foundation, but very basic",This book is pretty well written and has some good information inside. However it is very basic and is definitely for the beginning professional wrestler and no one else.
5,really nice book,"i really like this book. it has such a wide range of techniques, everything from button holes to lace making. definitely a good buy."
5,Reference Book,"I would recommend this book. I bought two copies, one for myself and one for a sewing friend. We have both been happily browsing the book. It has so many great techniques and ideas that will complement our sewing. This will definitely be a good reference book to keep."
1,Oh man....,"This ""movie"" was terrible, its like 45 minutes long, has huge plot holes, the acting is just terrible, and most of the movie does not contribute to the plot at all. I was not expecting much but I thought it could not be worse than a master p movie. I was wrong, the ending just says ""to be continued"". Please no more. I don't understand how anyone could possibly give this movie 5 stars."
3,Cash Moneys FIlm Debut,"First and foremost Cash Money Millionares' ""Baller Blockin'"" was a strait to video release. So do not buy this film expecting to see award winning acting performances. Whether or not you agree with me, the acting in this film was not horrible. On the contrary, the acting was quite good putting into consideration two things, the film was a straight to video release, and two, The film was made by a record company and an independant film studio. The Direction of this film was not half bad either. If You are a fan of Lil' Wayne, Baby, Juvenile, or any other Cash Money recording artists, buy this film, and you will not be dissapointed. The only complaint i have is that the length of the film fails to reach even one hour, about 55 mins to be exact. But, other than that, ""Baller Blockin'"" is a mildly enjoyable film."
1,in one word... awful,"This is truly the worst movie of all time. On the back of the DVD, it lists all of Cash Money's hit songs. So you think that it might be cool, just to listen to the soundtrack and watch all those cool music videos. But no... there is no real soundtrack. There is only 5 seconds of each song randomly played and only one music video, and its not so good either. Then there is the movie, which is so random that there could not have possibly been a script or even a director. You will come away after watching this movie shaking your head and wishing you knew how the hell 'whodi' could be used to refer to so many things."
1,movie sucked,"Jermy you are a punk bizzle fo shizzle and need to suck my dizzle. Shut up. This movie blows. Horrible acting and production, very little special features. It is a joke. Cash money is a joke for the most part. shizzle bizzle nizzle fizzle, jermy your'e a f*g shut up and no more reviews for you. Fo shiz..ut the hell up. beeyotch"
1,knock yourself out,"This movie could use some work,if you liked this movie you must not have any commonsense the best thing about this movie was it's ending.Hope that cash money leaves the movie makeing alone."
4,Baller blockin',"me and my friend both watched and we thought Cash money did their best. We think the main point of the movie was showin what they grew up in their past and what they lived through. As in a southern movie there is a lot of slang or ebonics,senseless profanity and death.if you look past all of that it's a southern staple, believe that dhere. So overall, ya shouldn't worry 'bout the not so good actin', or effects. Just concentrate on the story line.YA HEARD ME!$$$$$$$$$$$hood,from my head down to my shoes."
2,"Just laugh..........that's it, just laugh.","Ok so if I was really uneducated and had a lot of money I hadto ... away I would make a movie like this too. No surprises here,this could be called look at me I'm black and I'm rich. It's a reallylong rap video."
1,DRY CLEAN ONLY--FOR INFANT HIGH CHAIR?!,The high chair cover is DRY CLEAN only and was stained (destroyed) shortly after my son started feeding himself. I have tried to order a replacement cover and haven't had much luck finding one. The other features were nice but really didn't matter since I didn't use the high chair.
1,Bellagio cocoa mix: non-dairy creamer- ick!,"Seriously guys, you can't rise to the level of Swiss Miss and use powdered milk? I got the white chocolate and the truffle as a gift: the packaging is classy but the product tastes like plastic."
5,Bellagio Gourmet Mocha Hot Cocoa Chocolate 6 pack set,"I actually gave this as a gift to a friend (actually sent her THREE of these sets), and she was besides herself! She said they were EXCELLENT! and I guess I'll have to get ME some now!"
4,Gourmet hot cocoa,I received the product in about 5 days and it appeared exactly as pictured with no unpleasant surprises. I gave it as a gift so I do not know how it tasted. It seemed to be a nice small gift to give.
1,love american style,"you are correct...splitting a season in half is just a way for the studios to make more money. I am a huge fan of love american style but now I will wait for used dvds of the series to come out because what the studio is doing is just wrong and trying to make money and rip us off...I can wait 2 more years to purchase the dvds I am sure they will still be around and they will only cost no more than 5.00 dollars. To the people of the studios that did this stupid thing you will loose money when people like me will purchase used dvds, so rock on with your stupidity!!!!!!"
5,Love American Style on DVD at last!,"I am glad to see this finally released on dvd. I have been collecting some episodes on 16mm for some time now and it is a pleasure to watch it on dvd. The picture quality is better than what I have on most of the films. I would like to see some extras included but for now I am happy with this first release.I would appreciate to see the release of more seasons and I think if the sales are good they will continue. I have many favorites in all of the seasons. My all time favorite is ""Love and the wishing star"".What I enjoyed the most about this program is that you got to see many guest stars. I guess that is why I enjoyed ""The Love Boat"" and ""Fastasy Island"". I am glad to see the up coming release of ""The Love Boat"". I am enjoying some of the episodes in this first release that I did not remember from the first season.Keep up the good work!"
4,Fun toy for my 4-year-old,"We like this toy a lot. It promotes learning of cultural details, such as typical foods, dress, and animals of many countries, including the United States. Many of us grow up not knowing how to identify characteristics of even our own culture, whichever culture it may be, because it seems to be ""just how it is"". I think looking objectively at our own culture helps reduce ethnocentrism and hegemony. This toy also helps kids learn many country names and practice memorization skills. My kids enjoy being able to switch the disks and watch them spin around through the window in the cover. It's brilliantly designed with a compartment on the back to store the disks, however, my 4 y.o. has trouble getting them in there. Also, the disk cover comes off easily, but it's easy to snap back into place. Overall, well-recommended!"
1,"Westernized ""Tantric"" practices and poor writing","This book recounts the experiences of a woman who thinks she has been initiated into Tantric practices; her so-called education is a Westernized and one-sided (sex-obsessed) version of Tantra. Thus, in trying to be a useful portrayal of Tantric practices, this book missed the mark completely and deserves one star (it's also not very well written). I suppose if it had been billed as erotica about nice long orgasms, I would give it two or three stars as the bar for writing in erotica is set pretty low. For readers that are looking for grounded advice in Tantric practices, I recommended Daniel Odier's accessible book Desire.Desire: The Tantric Path to Awakening"
1,Not a awakening,The author is deluded about her own spiritual attainments.She has no genuine experience with a genuine kundalini awakening.Those looking for a easy spiritual liberation wont find it.Purify Purify Purify.Good Karma Good Karma Good Karma.Tantra has its place but not how it is presented in this book.
1,Doesn't mist well,as the title says it doesn't mist well. it shoots water with a lot of force. better to go with another product
3,"Not Bad, but could be better","I received this shirt in good condition and was shipped to me nice and fast.For the price its ok but I expected the ""eagle, globe and anchor"" USMC Logo to be a bit nicer quality.The text on rear of shirt is fine my only complaint is regarding the USMC emblem on the front breast, its just ""ok"" kind of looks like a cheap silk screen rendering. The photo on the listing is accurate but because its so small it can lead you to believe that there is more detail than actually.overall im satisfied I will make sure I look at the pictures better before I buy next time.Semper Fi"
2,This shirt is a little thin,"I thought that being an official shirt for the USMC, this shirt would be like a ""Beefy-T"". Well--it is a little thin and flimsy. I was disappointed when I received it. I love the sentiment and the design of the shirt as well as loving my friends in the USMC, but this shirt doesn't cut it. A message to Rothco-- ""Where's the Beef""? I would give the shirt no stars if it wasn't one of my favorite logo shirts."
2,Missed that the shirt was 50/50.,I was disappointed in the quality of the shirt and the fact that I must have missed the fact that it was not 100% cotton. OohRah!
1,Michael's Proteges,"It took a long, long time, but mentor Michael Jackson finally broke these guys in and made them his own. Now they demonstrate beyond all doubt that they have truly mastered the Old Master's grooves and beats. It must have taken hundreds of hours and much grueling discipline in the Play Room at Neverland Ranch before these young boys finally ""got it"". But they clearly did ""get it"" in the end! This is evident from their squeals of childlike glee as they prance across the stage re-enacting their fantasies of a land where no one ever needs to grow old or grow up, where they can play with each other forever in total innocence, blissfully unaware of the icky things adults are rumored to do. Now they are poised to take over where Master Michael left off and will act as shepherds to a whole new flock of young devotees. Bless these sweet young children and may their innocent musical merriment thrive unclouded by the sordid rumors currently swirling around their Master."
4,Pretty in Pink!!!,This case for the Razor V3 is great!! I recently have had many problems and returns b/c the cases ive ordered were NOT as advertised!!! What they said was pink was an UGLY purple & what they said was durable was flimsy plastic--NOT THIS PRODUCT THO!! This was such a pretty pink- exactly as pictured- LIGHT PINK not fuschia or magenta or purple but pink! It was also very durable and fit so snug--I feel confident that my phone is protected & looks cute :) BUY THIS IF U LIKE PINK!!!!
1,Angelis,Bought this as a present for my Mom on Christmas. Have not had a chance to listen to the CD yet. Am impressed with the shipping of this product by making it in time for Christmas!Can't rate this product yet---am giving it 1 star until I am able to listen to it.
2,Dog Hates Them...,"My dog doesn't have a real problem with breath, but I got these cheap off the clearance rack and wanted to try them. Unfortunately, Luna hates them. I give them to her and she spits them out. The only time she actually ate one was the first time I gave them to her. Anyway, they look and smell good, but are pointless because my dog refuses to eat them."
2,Ehh....,"I remember buying these years and years ago. At least a decade ago....Only one of our dogs enjoyed them, which is great, because they work! But the other two hated them, and they were by no means picky eaters."
1,Yip Yap Didn't Work,Easy they don't work. At least they did not work for my dog. They are very hard and no results after 3 boxes
1,High Hopes,"I really had high hopes for this product, but I am sorry to say that I have no idea if this works or not. I have the pickiest dog ever, and she turned her nose up at them! I have to admit though that after I smelled them, they didn't smell too appetizing."
1,EXPEDITED SHIPPING RIP-OFF,"This is the second request for a review alraedy submitted. I have not changed my mind. I paid $!4.99 fror Expedited Shipment. The seller sent the package of two batteries by regular letter mail, which cost $0.59 The batteries are OK--work well--but arrived too late for use on the trip for which they were bought...and the seller pocketed the nearly- $14.00 change! So, overall,items good; service and ethics of seller bad."
1,Don't Use 1-Click Ordering or Purchase Elsewhere,"Unfortunately, this review of this product has to get one star only because of Amazon.com's poor 1-Click Ordering. Granted I don't buy from Amazon.com frequently as I can find the same items from other online websites; however, I decided to purchase this Sony NP-FT1 battery using 1-Click Ordering. Doing this, I was charged the Standard Shipping versus given a choice to select the free Super Saver shipping. I reviewed my options and I couldn't set the shipping settings to select Super Saver shipping. I call Amazon.com's customer service, and unfortunately and expectantly, absolutely nothing can be done for me as my order had been already shipped."
5,Happy buyer!!,"I have never bought on Amazon before,so I took a chance, and don't regret it at all. This battery works just like the one that came with my Sony DSC-T10 and love how that camera fits perfectly in my purse, but the only thing that was missing was an extra battery, I just didn't want to pay 69$ for it in a store. So I checked online and found amazon to have the right prize with out the hassle of eBay.Recommend shoppers to buy from this company, I got my moneys worth!Sony camera owner."
5,Sony's the best,I have 3 of these batteries for my T9 and they are the best. With a 2GB memory card...it takes 2 batteries to fill the card (that is 600+ pictures).
4,be careful with the generic batteries,They are cheap but not reliable. The one I bought cost 4 dollars but died after a couple of uses. This Sony NPFT1 can last more than an hour for each charge so far.
2,Rechargeable Battery Pack,"For some reason this Sony rechargeable battery doesn't hold a charge very long compared to the original one that I purchased when buying my camera a number of years ago. It's better than not having a spare battery but I wish I could have found one at a local store instead. I wonder if these are recycled batteries, thus inferior to brand new ones."
1,"The Unchargeable, chargable.","Threw away my money AGAIN. Was thrilled to find a new battery for my favorite SONY camera, only to find I was sent a unchargable T1 chargable battery."
5,Get the REAL thing!,This Sony NPFT1 InfoLithium Rechargeable Batty Pack is the exact same battery that came with my camera. It's great to have an extra battery pack. I keep one in my camera and the other one in the charger pulled into the wall. Ready to change out anytime it's needed.
2,AC Outlet Works/Car Charger Outlet Didn't,"Good idea for product. I like the size too. The AC outlet works fine; powers up my laptop fine. However, the car charger did not work at all. I plugged in different car chargers (cell phone car chargers and GPS charger) but they never powered on. Too bad."
4,Just Buy a good stuff!!!!,"It's a powerfull energy fount, if you are looking for this kind of instrument, for price and features buy this one..."
2,Very slow movement and lots of talking...,"I just reviewed this program and I had difficulty following along. This is because the the program is so slow and the narrator has such a calming voice that I kept yawning. There is narration throughout the entire program, had the narration stopped, I may have had a minute to calm my mind as the program encourages. This is a relaxing program, almost too relaxing.The other distraction in this program is the use of bricks, blankets and a chair. The narration focuses a lot of time on these accessories. It would've been nice to have the narration give directions for people who choose to follow along without the accessories.The overall program devotes a lot of time to holding certain positions and the narration talks through each interval of a position which could be annoying at times. The pace of the programs are a little too slow. Suzanne's look could also be a distraction for some people. I'm still looking for a program that offers more varieties of positions."
4,glad i got it,This is very easy to do and I feel great after! With being diagnosed with fibromyalgia it helps with being able to stretch and loosen up!
3,Average,"The yoga positions are good, but they are more for relaxation than weight loss. If you want yoga for relaxation, it is fine."
2,Before you start...,"I haven't actually been able to do this workout yet--not because I haven't wanted to because I have, but because YOU NEED TO HAVE YOGA BLOCKS TO DO IT. I don't have those yoga blocks, so now I have to go pay more $$ for equipment. It doesn't say anywhere on the DVD that you need any equipment. It's really, really annoying because you should know what you need before you wake up at 5:30 AM and pop the DVD in thinking you'll get a workout first thing."
1,Yoga for who???,"I'm overweight, so I bought yoga for weightloss. Well, right at the beginning of the workout the instructor, who is not overweight, launches into several positions that I cannot do BECAUSE I AM OVERWEIGHT. I would have to be at close to a normal weight to fit myself into the positions she does.What's the point? I thought this might actually have positions I could do. I ejected the disc five minutes into it and added it to my coaster collection.Thanks for nothing."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought a talking Bulldog car alarm and installed it. The remote controller fell apart when dropped. The car alarm worked for around 3 weeks then died. I did not send in the warranty card within 5 days, so I was out of luck. It would have been warranted only for 3 months or a year. I wasted my money and time with Bull Dog. Can't recommend it. Better off buying a life-time warranty brand."
5,THE BEST FOR THE $$$,"As a professional car stereo technician, I have also installed a ton of alarms. I was a bit suspicious when I bought this alarm for a customer of mine who did not have much to spend. I was absolutely delighted to see how well this alaarm worked, and how simple it was to install. It ""learns"" your car very quickly! NOTE TO BUYER, this product does require some drilling and surface mounting that might be a challenge for the novice user!"
5,"VERY INTERESTING, FUN :))) AND CHEAP ALARM! MY CAR TALKS!","I recentely bought one of this, and I'm very satisfied with the product and it's amazing talking properties. It's very simple to install, you can do it by yourself, and works well. I desagree to the opinion of the 'please help me' lady. It only says this phrase if it's tempted, and you can adjust the sensor, so it do not occour false alarm. And the voice is intercallated by a siren, so you don't think it's really a woman crying. Her neighbor must adjust better his alarm sensor. Mine is ok. The alarm can be activated with or without voices. It's doing a lot of success in my town. THE BEST VALUE!"
4,Great system!!!! Hooks up in minutes.,I recently installed this system on my 2000 Mitsubushi Eclipse and have been very impressed with its performance thus far. This easy to install system is a must for anyone looking for some extra protection for their car. Criminals Beware !!!!
3,I got what I paid for.,"I got this alarm so that I wouldn't spend too much money, and it would be something to do on a weekend. When I got it, I was a little surprised -- the sensor and speaker were one unit. It is big -- there was no space for it under my 91 Honda Accord LX hood. I found a tiny dry spot under a 95 Civic hood, but installing it was a pain -- there was no space to work, and could only drill two holes. it took about an hour to install it. So, installing in 10 minutes is a myth if you don't have large dry emty space under the hood.It is not very sensitive either. I have put it on the maximum sensitivity. It will go off if I slap on the hood, or close the door. It won't usually start when I open the door or turn on the engine. Maybe a Civic's lights are not very powerful to create a current drain on the battery.But I like when the car talks. :o) If you save more than 50 bucks on insurance, you have covered your cost."
5,Count me in!,"Any car alarm that has the added bonus of offending a shrieking womynist like ""Rising Pheonix"" is aces in my book. I'm definately buying it now- and once I hook it up I'm going to set it off at random and see how many brain anurisms I can give to Womens Studies minors that wander within earshot."
2,"Stand good, hammock not","Too loosely woven hammock, rope stretches too much, anyone over 150 lbs barely off the ground and resting in a VEE shape. Needs much firmer roping. The stand is good, easily assembled by a single person. Since the stand with hammocks costs about the same as a stand by itself, it's a good value for a hammock for youngsters."
1,Piece of Junk! Fell apart after few uses!!!!!,"I am 125 lbs and this hammock should hold up to 300 lbs. One of the cheap ropes snapped in half on my 5th use of this item and I fell down, hit my head, smashed my elbow and hurt my back. Amazon being a company too large to care about the well being of the people they sell to would only give me a partial refund on a defective, dangerous product. I believe sending them my doctor's bills will be next as this has been a bad experience all around. DO NOT BUY THIS HAMMOCK! CHEAPLY MADE, DANGEROUS PRODUCT!!!!!!"
4,caution,hammock itself is not very well made - had set less that a year and had to replace. But I do enjoy
3,Takes a loooooot of rooooom,"I imaged it took a lot of room, just not how much. I went for it because of the price. It makes more sense to go for designs with a central beam"
5,Great Blanket!,"Really happy with the service at Amazon. VERY fast shipment, it was for a friend's birthday present, happy it arrived in time. Brilliant colors, and soft.I've been buying Biederlack blankets for years, well made quality blankets.I'm quite pleased and hope they enjoy their blanket for many years to come, GO CUBS!"
5,A great gift,This tool kit was one of the first wedding gifts we received. We've used it many times over the past few weeks to put together many of our other wedding presents. The tools feel and look great and work well. I love how the tape measure locks with the slight pressure of the thumb. I've used the hammer several times; it fits well in my hand and it's not too heavy. This is the perfect gift for newlyweds.
3,Prefer Tomboy Tools,"Barbara K tools are nice, but having some of both (Barbara K and Tomboy Tools), I much prefer the Tomboy Tools. Tomboy Tools are generally designed more for a woman to get the job done! The multibit screwdrive is awesome from Tomboy Tools. Check it out...www.TomboyTools.com"
1,This reference book is inadequate and not worth the money,"I was very dissatisfied with this book. There are scarce amount of terms, and the definitions themselves are not impressive."
2,A Beginner Book,"I love to jump rope and purchased this book thinking I could learn some cool tricks and really improve my fitness. Instead I found that the book had nothing to teach me that I didn't already know. There are no ""cool tricks"" or amazing routines in this book, but if you're just getting started in the world of jump roping, this may be the book for you."
4,Great product,"What can you expect from a book? Ok its difficult sometimes to envisage what is meant sometimes, but perseverance is the only thing that separates the has, from the has nots of this world. If you want to develop good hand and foot speed and leave the opposition thinking ""when did that takedown happen"" then you need to jump rope every day, and this book is where it can start from. A+ excellent..."
5,Excelente,"El libro es perfecto para aquellos que quieren aprovechar todos los beneficios que el Jump Rope ofrece. Es la mejor manera para incorporar de manera prudente esa actividad al entrenamiento diario, sin lesiones o daños musculares. Muy entretenido y muy fácil de entender y leer."
1,"Poor service, Poor communication, Poor way to do business",I have not yet received this product. I e-mailed Bargain Cell numerous times and I still have not received my missing merchandise. Although they have charged my credit card over a month and a half ago.I paid $24.93 S&H; for $11.35 of stuff not a real bargain. And they will not tell you that anywhere in the process.I recommend that you DO NOT buy anything from BargainCell
2,Not a Good Snap on Case,"The case fit great, but due to the snap on the back of the case being ""star"" shaped with nubs, the more you attached it to your clip and turned it around, the more pressure was put on the ""star"". Now a couple of the nubs are broken and will no longer remain attached to the clip. The original clip i purchased from AT&T was round, i didnt have this problem. Now i have to look for another."
2,Useless,The clip on the back would not stop moving at all. The phone always had to be rotated back into the upright position due to the unnecessary clicking. It would not stay in place for any thing. The case was flimsier than originally indicated as well.Ended up purchasing another case that was cheaper but performed better. Would not recommend this case to anyone for purchase. I ended up giving it to the guy at my cleaners who liked it and had no case at all. He knocked $7 off of my alteration bill:-)
3,Could have been much better,"This case would be a lot better if the clip on the back could be completely removed. Even without the clip itself, the other part of it just hangs there, adding volume to my phone."
1,Jade Sucks!,"I love Jade,she is my farorite girl in the Bratz Pack. When I saw Pashion4Fashion Jade in Target, I was shocked!! There are two things about Jade that I like, her eyes and her bangs,P4F Jade does not have bangs,and her eyes are grey!! Her silver stilleto's do not match with either outfit. Her first pair of clothes are Okay. Overall not a good Jade,actually horrible!!"
2,Just the history of the telescope,"I had hoped for a better discussion of the engineering behind the telescope. It's clear that the building of this telescope was a tedious process and so was the reading of this book. This book provides excruciating detail to the historical events behind the telescope, but not nearly enough about the engineering hurdles and the creative solutions developed to overcome them. I also would have loved a nice, detailed drawing of the entire telescope showing some of the parts he's talking about and how they're assembled."
4,Deadly Shift,Strictly a B Movie Disastor Flick. Received in excellent time and was packaged to my expectations. Movie itself was OK.
2,Bland and boring,"This book isn't really worth the money in my opinion. I recently purchased a Nikon D70s and was hoping that this book would show me the way into taking great pictures with a digital SLR camera. It didn't really offer me much. The book is probably very good for a person who has never taken a picture with an SLR camera. If you have any experience with the basics of photography, this is probably a waste of your money. The book is printed in black and white and simply doesn't compare to some of the other color books out there."
1,$20 for 2 lbs of beans.,"Need I say more? Yes, it is on me. It is up to the buyer to be aware of the purchase. As we all do, however, I hit the 1 click button and bypassed the fact that with taxes, fees, shipping...I was ordering $20 for what are, essentially, navy beans. I have always wanted to make some homemade Pasta Fagioli. These bags...are they even fresh? DIfficult to tell...they are crinkled and settled. Anyway, the 1 star is only valid to me, since I IMMEDIATELY sent a request to CANCEL this order. Yet, 2 days later the beans arrived. They are sitting on my counter; leering at me for my idiocy! I am sure this is a fine company. Just check every detail and order the long way, not 1-click. I do wish this company the best. They have a good reputation, to my knowledge. They just should have honored my request to cancel, this time. They would have gotten LOTS of business from me later. I buy stuff like this on Amazon constantly and love to cook. Truly, a mutual loss, and too bad..."
5,Just Perfect!,"At last, the long awaited second CD. It was certainly worth the wait. Paul's musical genius shines through with this CD."
5,A remarkable and unique in-depth artbook,"Co-written by Joanna Selborne and Lindsay Newman, Gwen Raverat: Wood Engraver informatively examines the life and work of Gwen Raverat (1885-1957), the only woman to become a founder-member of the Society of Wood Engravers. Gwen Raverat's prolific carvings, her overtones of impressionism, her memorable children's book illustrations, and so much more, are all displayed in black-and-white and knowledgeably discussed at great length. A remarkable and unique in-depth artbook, Gwen Raverat: Wood Engraver is a unique and seminally important addition to academic and community library History of Art reference collections."
4,"More progressive less melodic than ""Return to heaven denied""","Labrinth is among my favorite Bands because its very melodic,.although this second release is more progressive and less melodic than their first album ""return to heaven denied"",I liked the first one more but this one is still very good,the fact that it's more progressive and complex makes you want to go over it more to catch on the detail. the album evolves around a tale placed in ancient paris. there's a lot of diferent colors to the music here and it's a more metal type than in return to heaven denied,the vocals are much more developed here and in base of the storytelling the music is also much more dramatic. there's a lot of power behind this one and there's also a beautifull ballad that I enjoy listening to over and over again ""Love""."
1,Review,"This book represents a movement away from logic and scientific methodology and towards an incredibly subjective pseudo-'archaeological' account of New Zealand's prehistory based upon folk law and white supremacy generated myth. Doutre conveniently ignores the vast amount of independent and cumulative evidence arrived at by experts, and in place offers a conspiracy theory of academic cover-ups. This self published book is a must read for anyone interested in how not to approach prehistory in a scientific and balanced perspective."
4,Brilliantly translated Chinese Literature,"A brilliant book. Beautifully translated by Burton Watson, but the real focus lies not with him, but naturally on the poems of Han-Shan, a Chinese poet and philosopher. Han-Shan's poems are truly wonderful, and thankfully devoid of the pretentiousness that belies much of the literature from that era. Highly Recommended."
1,Waste of money,"Purchased it directly from x10 websiteAnd had it returned the very next day.The buttons made of silicone and they stick when pressed. Sometimes you have to wait 1-2 seconds for the button to be released so that you can push it again. Very very annoying.If you're ok with this, read on. Easy to use and operate. Although feels like it's very cheaply made."
3,"Nice watch, but the strap sucks","The strap within weeks looks terrible, peeling and discolored. The watch itself though I really like, so be prepared to replace the strap shortly after buying it."
5,Wonderful!,"Bonnie's books are all great! This was the first one I ever read and it changed how I did things around the house. I got so organized that I eventually wrote my own book - Marnie's Kitchen Shortcuts.Thanks, Bonnie, for the excellent tips and for the help with the kids, too (401 Ways to Get Your Kids to Work at Home)!"
2,Needs to be updated!,"While I liked McCullough's encouraging tone and some of her ideas, this book needs to be revised for modern times. Written 27 years ago, some examples like the to do item ""type ditto"" and how a friend saved worktime by getting an extra-long cord on her phone are so outdated that they provided a few unintended laughs. A better purchase might be the Messie books by Sandra Felton, or for household management, the Flylady book."
2,Too old fashioned,"This book had some good ideas if it were 1970. It's very outdated. I'm sure it was a good book when it was still current, but in 2006, it's just a a waste of time and money."
3,Out of date,"Outdated, advice simply common sense. How to create booklet useful, only if one has no imagination of your own.May be more useful to someone with 2 or 3 children."
3,Poor Quality Print on Demand Book,"The book itself is great, so this is not a review of the content of the book. But if you purchase this book, be aware that it is a print on demand book and the print may be of poor quality. The pages of mine were like a cheap photocopy, which made it hard to read. You may wish to purchase a used copy elsewhere - it might be of better quality than a new print on demand book ordered here."
4,A gift for my grandson,"I gave this to my grandson as a birthday present. He had heard of the toy before, and was very excited to receive it. He has enjoyed playing with it, except he's had some trouble making it do all it s tricks."
3,satisfactory,Condition is as our expectations. My grandson thoroughly enjoys playing with his Hot Wheels: Monster Jam Flip and Crash.
4,"Fantastic music, relaxing scenes","My husband is the Jazz officianado and he really liked the music on this DVD, I like it too but couldn't tell you why. The fire place is okay to watch, but the scenery change view is very enjoyable. Snow on pines, ornaments, homes decorated for the season tastefully. Very enjoyable. Something you could put on your large screen TV during the family gathering and be sure it would make a nice addition."
1,"Crash, crash, crash!","I've worked with various Pinnacle Studio versions since last decade, and they've all had two things in common:1. When the program works, it's superb.2. The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard!For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out. This verson is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price. At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice? Shop around. Google the competition. But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle."
1,Garbage,"This is the worst software I've ever worked with. Since April, I've had nothing but problems with it. Every time I do their recommended ""fix"", it creates another problem. Tech support is a joke - I've not had one e-mail response that helped & when I went on their live support, the tech kept disconnecting me. I've also had to reformat my hard drive 4 times because of this product. To add salt to the wound, I've lost 3 months of work I did on creating a DVD for my church.Don't even think about buying this piece of garbage. I've invested $400 in it & am sure I will have to fight Pinnacle to get a refund."
1,"Unusable, Locks-up 90% of the time I use it.","I am running a relatively new machine with XP service Pack 2, a 3.06 GHz Intel Processor and 1 Gig of Ram. As a long time user of Version 9 which has always worked well and I was looking forward to version 10 for improvements and added capabilities, what I got was a nightmare. Version 10 is completely unusable and locks up 90% of the time. Another note is that if you open a project created in version 9 it converts it into a project that can only be used in 10. So all the 9 projects that I opened in 10 are now unusable in version 9.Pinnacle should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such trash."
1,What crap!,"Crash and freeze! That's all it does! I have a high-end machine and this will not run. Emailed support and after 6 days I was told the standard ""drfrag and shutdown background programs"" They are useless! I have un-installed and re-installed 3 times. I am running a P4 3400, PCIe 256mb vid card, 2gb PC5400 mem and plenty of HDD space. This program is a pig! Don't waste your money, I did."
1,"Poorly designed, malfunctioning, resourse hog","This software comes with four cds but Pinnacle only put three in a cd sleeve, leaving the fourth to be banged around during shipment and arrived highly scratched. During the installation process you are prompted to install the 3rd cd but fails to install. I had to manually install the 3rd disk and then go back to the main install program to finish. That installation is for Studio Plus 10 only. The MediaSuite portion is contained on the 4th cd. After starting this installation, it refused to recognise the previous Studio Plus 10 installation (a requirement) and exits. A problem that Pinnacle is currently working on. The program is barely out on the shelf and we're up to three patches so far. All this combined with a 90+ minute install, cd-key PLUS online activation, lengthy start time and the fact that the MediaSuite portion is dead-out-of-the-box makes this software a definate waste of money."
1,"Junk software, please don't buy.",This is an piece of junk software.Problems started with installation. It took two times clean installation to bring up the software and it keeps crashing.PLEASE DONT BUY this software.I do not what to do with the software.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ............. Don't buy this software.
3,Razzor Edge,"The delivery was fast and the book appeared to be in good condition the pages were a tanted color due to possibly the age, what was a sad thing was that the hard front cover when you look at it was in great condition but when we opened it the binding on the base of the book cracked all the way down. The book must have not been kept in a sealed book case and it should have mentioned that the book cover was damaged. I wouldn't have bought it for the price, however my son said he will pay to have it repaired and likes the book. I hate giving a present to anyone when its damaged."
3,"Not The Greatest Movie Ever Made, But Good Cast & Interestng Plot. A.J. Cook Is Terrific.","I saw this movie On Demand this past week and, while it isn't exactly the greatest film ever made, it's engaging enough because of the screen prescence of A. J. Cook (several years before the CBS crime drama""Criminal Minds"") and a twist or two on a familiar plot. It's got its funny & tender moments. However, the ending was a little drawn out.SPOILER AHEAD!!! They could've ended the movie with Dwn holding Michael in her arms as they kissed at the dance AFTER showing what happened to the evil Mercedes (that's just me, though). LOVED the song ""With You Tonight."" Great beat. A made-for-TV movie for the whole family. Rated PG for some scary moments."
2,BUGS AND MORE BUGS in this game.,"Well, the game is fun to play... But the yardage for the plays in not accurate. Lots of errors during game play. Running issues at times. So over all if you can deal with the bugs and problems in the game then try it."
5,Excellent Discussion of a neglected subject,"Although more books have been written about Abraham Lincoln than anyone else in history except Jesus of Nazareth and William Shakespeare, few of them have looked with any intensity or insight at Lincoln's religion. Lots of people mention it, but few have really studied it. Trueblood gives a superb viewing of Lincoln's spirituality, revealing what books Lincoln read while growing up (including Aesop's Fables, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and Weems' Life of Washington among others), what his spiritual heritage was, and how his own theology developed over the years, being intensified and refined while in the president's office during the Civil War years. If you can find a copy of this out of print classic (only 150 pages long), by all means read it. It's excellent reading."
4,"Easy to read, and etremely genuine","If you want to know more about what Licoln's character was like, this is perfect. It gives a genuine feel for who he really was, it does not gloss him up and make him look like god, nor does it tear him apart. The author simply states the man for who he is, good and bad. It's an easy read and a great read."
5,The Best Carpet Cleaner Ever,My daughter-in-law introduced me to this product and I have been very pleased with its performance in cleaning my carpet and bringing it back to life. My carpet looks almost new when I am done cleaning with this fiber cleansing shampoo with Scotchgard. Very happy with the job it does.
5,Who knew hips were so hot?!,Beautiful photos of an oft-overlooked part of the body that is -- now that I think about it -- a stunning intersection of the functional and the sensual. Great conversation/titillation piece for the coffee table.
3,An aray of photos,"Hips is full of...hips. Many different hips, all taken from the same position (or some what)Interesting photos that show character."
1,Over-hyped,"I didn't think the book was very interesting. Very narrow focus, and pretty stereotypical stuff."
4,Fun movies for little kids,"While it's not necessarily great cinema for adults, it entertains my preschooler. My preschooler especially loves film #2 with the baby T-Rex. I think the films also teach some good values lessons. My only complaint is that film #1 (the original Land Before Time film) in this set was not digitally re-mastered so if you have a high definition TV, even with progressive scan on the DVD player, film #1 can be a bit grainy. Films 2, 3 and 4 all look great on an HDTV and the sound for all 4 plays well on a home theater system."
5,A great inside look at Gang Green!,"An absolute must have for EVERY Jets fan, and a great read for any football fan. This book is not your typical home-team love fest; Mr. Lange regales the reader with stories of triumph and of tribulation with equal aplomb. Book is loaded with facts, stats, and history. Highly Recommended!"
3,"Give us more, Please!!","I loved the first two books in this series. They were very detailed about the personalities and motives of the characters. The sex was great! The endings left me breathless, wanting more. Then, what happened? If I was Brandon Fox's editor, I would have sent him back to the word processor to work on this story to flesh (sorry about that) it out more. It just seems like half a story to me. The new character is fine, but could have been developed more. Erik and Skorri don't hold a candle to Nicolai and Sorren. And where is the zaimandar.... Brandon Fox is a very good writer, but this is not his best work. Come on, Brandon, give us more!"
2,Not their best.,"My daughter is also a major fan of The Wiggles and I must say that I normally enjoy their performances too. That is, until this DVD. I personally didn't like it at all and neither did my little girl. As usual, when it first started, she sat in rapt attention because her favorite characters were on. After a while though, she actually tried to turn off the television! She NEVER does that when The Wiggles are on."
5,We love The Wiggles!,"I will concede that this isn't the very best Wiggles DVD ever, but it's still a great show! My 3 year old has loved the Wiggles for years now, and she loves this DVD as much as the others.I agree that if you're starting, ""Yummy Yummy"" or ""Wake Up Jeff"" or ""Toot Toot"" are awesome starters. But this DVD is still really fun to watch!"
1,The Wiggles - Cold Spaghetti Western,"Poor script with a few good songs - slow pace with to much narration for my 19 month old. Try Top of the Tots, Wiggly Gremlins, and Yummy Yummy - he loves them."
1,Ice Cold...,"Being DIE HARD WIGGLES fans, we purchased Cold Spaghetti Western because it was the WIGGLES... Don't waste your money.It's pretty bad and usually they are right on! My three kids (2,3,4 yrs) left the room!?! Usually, they are GLUED to the Wiggles. Too much talking, not enough songs, and a inconsistent ""plot."" Try Top of the Tots, Wiggle Bay, Hoop de Doo, or even Space Dancing before buying this one!"
1,Not Very Wiggly,"My son is a huge Wiggle fan. We own every Wiggle DVD that is available in the USA, and I have to say that I easily tolerate watching them multiple times during the week. However, Cold Spaghetti is the ONLY Wiggle movie that is utterly painful to sit through. EVERYTHING about this movie is horrible. The story is dumb, the acting terrible, and sadly, the music is THE WORST!!! This is the only Wiggle movie that my son is not interested in. The few times I put it on, he watched it for a few minutes and then started to whine. I am sorry I wasted my money on this movie, as he is obviously not interested in seeing it. And I can't say I blame him. Parents, do yourself and your children a favor and buy any Wiggle movie but this one."
5,Our 3 Year Old Loves It,"Our three year old really likes this DVD. He now asks us if he can watch the Cowboy Wiggles. The Wiggles do have a knack for knowing how to entertain children, and this DVD does a good job entertaining children. Yes, it is pretty dumb, but it would be unfair to judge this movie from an adult's perspective. All of the dumb gags and songs are intended for children, and they seem to work. We are giving this 5 stars because our son really enjoys it.It would be nice if the Wiggles used children dancers like they did in thier early DVDs. Also, if you are new to the Wiggles, you would be better off starting Wiggle Time, Toot Toot, or Yummy Yummy.As bonus material, the DVD includes an enjoyable behind the scenes video from their tour of Asia. It's kind of fun to see them getting ready for a show."
2,Disappointed,"My son is 20 months old and addicted to the Wiggles, he has been really pleased with Magical Adventure, Wiggle Bay and Wiggly Safari watching them over and over so I thought this would be the next one on our list and he and ""we"", my husband and I, are disappointed, it did not hold our attention far less my son's. Like one other person had mentioned, my son, like their child wanted the ones we already owned back on like mentioned above along with Top of the Tots so Cold Spagetti is certainly cold, not playing in our house :o("
2,Awful for parents. Kids may be entertained,"This movie is horrible. My two year old will watch this movie, but not with the same enthusiasm as other Wiggles videos. This is by far the worst Wiggles movie. My husband and I were extremely disappointed. Very hard for adults to sit through."
2,More Bad Than Good Here,"A few catchy songs (Master Pasta Maker being my favorite), a few songs that are just blah and a downright silly ""plot."" The Wiggles love the town picnic and Alfonso's Great Western Cafe, and yet they have to ask for directions to get to town? What's that all about? Captain Feathersword pretty much remains in the background in this one, as do Dorothy, Wags and Henry. When my daughter indicates that she wants to watch this DVD, I put it in and fast forward to some of the better songs. The Wiggly Postcard from Asia is great, though. We all really enjoy that."
1,Tortuous for Parents Manic Wiggles drive me crazy,"This is the first Wiggles video that we got for our 2+ daughter. She likes the video a lot, but I have to say I find it impossible to watch. Based solely on this video alone, it is impossible for me to see what talent these four guys have at all. They are incredible annoying and MANIC (and I have no problem sitting through multiple Barney episodes). I also have a problem with the dumb stereotypes that they perpetuate. A siesta contest in which people compete at sleeping with Mexican characters looking on, and a Wiggle imitating a Chinese Chef with a Fu Man Chu mustache; not cool. I wish I could give it negative stars."
2,"We love the Wiggles, but we're disappointed with this video","First, let me say that we're major Wiggles fans in our house: our copies of the videos ""Wiggle Bay,"" ""Hoop-Dee-Doo"" and ""Yummy Yummy"" get played over and over. That said, however, ""Cold Spaghetti Western"" was a disappointment to us (just like the other recent Wiggles video ""Tops of the Tots""). These recent videos have an assembly-line quality about them -- the songs aren't memorable, the personalities of the Wiggles don't come through like they do in the older videos, and the adult professional dance troupe the Wiggles work with now is quite annoying (it was much nicer when they were doing the dancing themselves and having amateur children as dancers). Our advice is to check out the older videos -- the production values aren't as high but they have a lot more charm, originality and Wiggly joie de vivre than this one."
2,Defective DVD.,"Would've been nice to see this show if the DVD sent to me wasn't defective and sold to me as ""new""."
4,We loved this DVD,"We sadly had to return this DVD to the library and now we're waiting for our own DVD to be delivered. My twins are 4 and they keep saying how much they liked the ""cowboy Wiggles"". They are constantly singing Masta Pasta Maker which is a very catchy tune - how many Wiggles tunes aren't?!? When the 3 of us were fixing dinner the other night, and my son kept talking about how we were using the ""secret ingredient"" for our own meal - he was impressed!Personally, I enjoyed the mini documentary about the Wiggles in China and Japan. You get to see them as people traveling and seeing sights like the great wall of China. My favorite scene is the four of them behind the curtain waiting to perform, their silliness lets us see them as humans and not just the Wiggles.I'll be sad when my kids outgrow the Wiggles, so I'm enjoying these guys as much as I can now!"
3,Not One of the Wiggles' Best!!!,"Some of the reviews of this video are correct. From ""what happened here,"" to ""a disappointment,"" I'd have to agree with most of it. Oh sure, our girls love the Wiggles, as we did, but when my family got the DVD of this movie, and we sat down to watch it, we were disappointed as well, and there was a definite lack of interest.I'm sure these guys wanted to branch out, so to speak, and they got their Cowboy outfits on and tried to save this restaurant of sorts, but it wasn't like the studio, or even some of the others like ""Yummy Yummy,"" but again, the movie's not being compared to those videos. This movie stands alone, and it still isn't very compelling to watch, and we've seen it a few times.Maybe the girls have to be a little older, and maybe we'll all need to see what we missed, because something is missing in this movie, and I wish they'd do it over again."
3,Not the Best of the Wiggles,"I guess just about everyone feels the same about this video. We LOVE the Wiggles. We sing their songs all the time. Their videos are the most watched in our house by far! But, this time they missed the boat. The songs are forced, not catchy, dumb. The storyline is pathetic. I am sad for the Wiggles, until now we thought they were perfect. Anyway, buy a different Wiggles movie and skip this one. OH>>>> but I have to admit, yes, it's true, my toddler is plastered to the tv when this one is on too, he enjoys, I don't."
3,String Review,This strings are OK but just didn't ring as well on my Tak as others. I switched back to the original EXP D'Addario.
3,Mark Nauman,a few of the episodes were not viewable for whatever reason.....but I love the showeverything did arrive in a very timely manner........overall very good
2,to much freezing up,Love the show. But would costanatly freeze up. then have to refresh the page to get it to unfreese. Hope the rest of the sesopms do better
5,Mission Impssible Season 3,"This is Mission Impossible the way I like it. You know the plan or most of it. You see something going on and say, ""Oh! That's what that thing is for. Something goes not quite according to plan, but somehow the team gets around it.You can see it truly takes a team, one in which each member is a vital part. And in the end they all ride away, usually together as the ""bad guys"" get what they deserve. Mission accomplished!Mission Impossible - The Third TV Season"
4,Mission Impossible Season 3,Re: Mission Impossible Third SeasonExcellent DVD series. Very enjoyable.
4,Mission Impossible Review,"GREAT, I've liked this series since I 1st saw it on TV. Peter Graves was suited for the role of the leader And the rest of the cast SUPERB."
4,MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TV SEASON 3 GOOD ONE!,"PURCHASED MISSION IMPOSSIBLE SEASON 3 TELEVISION SERIES FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS. ORDERED SEASONS 1 & 2 PREVIOUSLY FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. HE WAS SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THESE, AND PLEASED WITH ALL DVD SETS. QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, AND SHOWS ARE INTERESTING TO WATCH. I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE SETS TO ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL T.V. SERIES, AND ANYONE INTERESTED IN ""CLASSIC T.V."""
5,Mission Impossible Season 3,"This series, while old by date, is the number one interesting plot TV series in my recollection. Good action! Good suspense! Good casting! Has a real life look to it because it's before digitizing. I like the team aspect of the series!"
2,"Typical - very, VERY typical","Some great footage of real music legends edited into obscenely short clips with unenlightening narrative commentary by a bunch of folk-music has-beens and nobodies vieing for the viewers sympathies by maundering on cluelessly about the fabled sufferings of the American underclasses. Lots of bogus romanticization which would be thoroughly unecessasary if they had simply shut up and let the music speak for itself (like i give a crap what KEB MO has to say about any of the great bluesmen!!). The treatment of most of the musical forms is hoplessley brief and slapdash - particularily the cajun and Zydeco segments. Unfortunately, a lot of people will claim to like this simply because they feel like they SHOULD, but this was a concept that had a lot of potential that was ultimately squandered. A waste of time and money."
1,"Weak, Confusing, Disappointing","Its hard to believe someone budgeted a 4-part series that says so little about such a fascinating and important subject. This is truly one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen and in four volumes! The first episode makes no sense, its just bits and pieces of sound clips, film and photos supposedly representing the development of roots music but there's no story that ties it together. For example, gospel music is one of the foundations of roots music. The documentary spends a fair amount of time on the topic but gives no real explanation of what it is or why its so important. You have to already be familiar with the history of american roots music to put together the confusing pieces. Kris Kristoffersen narrates and sounds like he's about to fall asleep. Its very lame, don't waste your money."
5,My Name Is KKKKKIIIIIIIIDDDDDD!!!,"Kid Rock is the man, this is an import edition of The History of Rock, with 2 CDs and 3 extra tracks, I would highly recommend picking this up. I don't wanna spoil the surprise because if I did, it wouldn't be anything special wouldn't it? But once again, you know it's something special when it's Kid Rock cause he is the man when it comes to kicking the phatest tracks and blowing your mind with something unexpected. So let's kick it all night long by getting this masterpiece by the one and only Kid that likes to Rock. Rock On My Friends!"
3,2 albums + 2 tracks,"Made in FRA in 2000, Serial# 3063322, Playing Time 84:23Part of ""The Back To Black Collection"", this 2-disc set unites BOC's 2nd album, 1973's ""Tyranny And Mutation"" on disc 1, plus 1 track from their 1st album, along with a 2nd disc which is made up of 1974's ""Secret Treaties"", their 3rd album, plus another track from their 1st album.If you're unfamiliar with this series, the packaging is made like a black booklet, with the artwork in silver, while the inside (28 pages) features lyrics, liner notes, all in full-colour.Worth buying instead of the 2 ""regular"" editions of the albums; if you've already got them, this item may not be worth buying, even though it has great packaging..."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Author Jonathan Bick gives general readers a short introduction to the ways that various laws apply to the Internet. He focuses on existing laws about contracts, defamation, privacy, copyright, trademark and other areas, and explains their application to the Internet environment, since few laws specific to the Internet have been drafted. He covers a variety of topics, including Internet-related taxes, rights, options, obligations, liabilities, debt collection, advertising, billing refunds, intellectual property protections and more, all organized into one- or two-page discussions. Each section is followed by a summary of the law or recommendations on how it applies to business. We [...] recommend this clear and easy-to-understand guide to anyone who uses the Internet for work, business or entertainment. And if you hit a section that doesn't apply to you, skip ahead - one advantage of the book's organization is that you can jump to the sections that interest you."
5,Good for Any WebSurfer,"If you're an avid web surfer, this book is great. You can find out what is and isn't legal and what rights you have online.Although the book isn't organized very well, it is still a good read and something that every high-tech junkie or old-fashioned newbie should read."
3,Free SF Reader,"""Blair rather amused me by asking permission to carry away a keepsakeof Belle Island as Kersae and I agreed to name it. Scattered over itssurface are many irregular blocks and ball-shaped masses--""bombs"" asthey are termed--greenish-black lava. One of the smaller of the blockswas rather pretty, having a very regular rectangular shape, and thelava deep-green in color, flecked with brilliant scales of metallicscarlet.""This wasn't the best idea, as the object involved is in the general class of 'horror artifacts'.Gives you nightmares, at sea or on land and leads you back to no fun times on the water.An early novel of this dark fantasy type, not too bad."
5,BRATZ ARE THE BEST,i have both passion for fashion dolls yasmin and cloe. yasmin comes with a magenta dress with tons of sparkles on it. cloe comes with a very elegant blue dress with very cool designs. they both come with 2 outfits and an extra pair of feet. i am planning to get the sasha and jade next. sasha comes with a white dress with gold highlights and jade comes with a sexy red dresss. THESE ARE THE BEST BRATZ DOLLS AND I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONEp.s. they alos have a passion for fashion house that is just amazin.
3,Cloe,"My treasures! Cloe is gorgeous but her hair is a little short. I'll buy P4F Cloe cuz her hair is a little longer, the greatest thing is the pakaging takes about 1 min. I also saw her not in Wal-Mart,not in Target, not in Toys 'R' Us but in a pharmacy!"
1,Are you kidding me? Depression prevention?,"I am so annoyed by even the idea of this book. A child psychologist recommended this book for my daughter, who is 7. I have suffered from depression almost my whole life. Perhaps had my parents just read a book, I wouldn't have gotten this CHEMICAL IMBALANCE IN THE BRAIN! How do you use tactics and social interaction to prevent a physical illness? If you know how to do that, you should be the richest person in the world. That's like writing a book on how to prevent getting diabetes. You can't. Congrats on feeding into a generation of bipolar and depressed parents who are terrified of passing their genetic predisposition onto their children. Disgusting."
2,"Its a lot of ""pie in the sky""","It's a lot of ""pie in the sky"" and no real hard data/science. The book claims to have ""real/hard data"", but when it is compared to a non-soft science field, its claims don't hold water.One my larger issue is if their program taught children to be optimistic, or just taught them to answer questions (their tests) optimistically. I.E. Giving the researchers the answers that they want to hear.When raising a child you basically have to ""try your best, and hope for the best""."
5,a must for every caring parent's library,"'Want to give your children a gift that will be precious to them for a lifetime? Give the gift of optimism.Although I first read the book two years ago, it has left an impression on my parenting and I sometimes refer back to it. Seligman's research-based approach to instilling optimism and confidence is both inspiring and relatively easy to implement. While the book focuses on older children who are already proficient in dealing with abstract concepts, I found the book useful as a parent of very young children: some concepts could be applied to my parenting surprisingly early, and all could be applied to my personal outlook to enhance my own optimism and mental health (and to help me model optimism for my children). I hope every parent reads this book!"
3,Needs more substance.,"An injection of self esteem without understanding the causes of depression? Good case examples followed by limited data to support theories. Fails to mention the life cycle and how cognition and depression develops. Could benifit from explanations and outcomes of various parenting styles. Title would be more in line with ""How to communicate with your child."""
3,So So,The book was heavier on examples than I would have preferred. . . I think it could have been more concise and still get the message across.
1,Very Disappointed,"I have learned my lesson to buy a product that had no reviews because this stroller is awful. We bought this stroller in a bit of a hurry because our original stroller, a travel system stroller by Graco that we loved, got broken by the airlines. I wanted a stroller that had reclining positions, a large canopy, and high handle bars. This stoller had all of my wishes, but sadly the adjustable seat is very hard to work (actually doesn't even work most of the time), it is flimsy and rickety feeling when you push it, the wheels get stuck (even on paved, flat surfaces), and the handle bar hurts my hands (it folds and the plastic isn't smoothed together and can really rub a blister on long walks.) Oh, and the basket underneath is miniscule and completely worthless... it might as well not even be there.I am going to have to buy my third stroller and my son is only 9 months old... here's hoping the next one lasts the duration!"
3,Juvenile but retro-fun,"Let's start with what I did like about this book. I liked the inclusion of the Hulk and the color was good. While I am not a huge fan of the managaesque drawings, they weren't the worst I have seen. Now I have never been a huge K-Zar fan and the Savage Land doesn't do much for me so bear that in mind. I enjoyed that this book had a very retro feel to it. The villains seemed like they were out of the 70's as did the story-telling. On the flip side, the story was a little too predictable and juvenile. I don't wanna spoil anything for you but having the bad guys as a big oil corporation out to ruin the world is just a little too cliche to be much fun. I did like the silly giant chicken cow and the ending. This isn't a bad book, but neither is it a good one. Low expectations should breed a happy read if you want to go down this road."
3,"Great bag, but...","The backpack is great, it looks really well constructed and it has a whole bunch of pockets. I do have a couple of notes however... my Thinkpad 770 does not fit in the laptop compartment, the laptop has a 14.1in screen and I guess they designed the bag with smaller laptops in mind. My other thought is the pocket that looks best suited to hold a calculator will not fit my TI-86, most of the students I know have a calculator with a similar form factor. The calculator does fit fine in one of the other pockets however.Otherwise, great bag, I'm glad I bought it."
4,Roomy and Organized,"I first bought your Messenger Bag and returned it. It was to large for what I was looking for. I then ordered your backpack. This is exactly what I need to commute back and forth to work. Large enough to carry my work, lunch and portable cd player. Easy access to the organizer in the front. Hangs on my shoulders very comfortably. Easy to remove and carry when in a crowded train. I would recommend this backpack to my friends."
3,Rating between PG-13 and R,"There are clearly marked R cards, but depending on your players, some of the PG-13 cards might not be PC."
4,"Insightful, readable, practical","This book offers much to anyone interested in cultivating a grateful outlook in life through reflection. Inspiring quotes, poetry and practical exercises complement the text, which describes Naikan's Japanese roots, but is presented in a Westerner-friendly way. There's even a little section on Benjamin Franklin's efforts at self-reflection. The book's format lends itself to dipping in for a quick tidbit as well as a cover-to-cover read. Readers may find themselves thanking their socks for keeping them warm, or enjoying a pizza with mindful attention. Very inspiring!"
5,having gratitude and responsibility,"wonderful process. makes you really think about your life, your actions, reactions.... really guides you gently and smack dab into self reflection. you will begin to see your relationships in a new light. you will see yourself in a new light. thank you!"
1,Arrived broken,The ornament was lovely. I wish I could have kept it. It was broken when I received it. Needed better packaging.
1,Worst quality video that I have seen on a DVD !,"I love Red Skelton, the VHS tapes of some of his best shows have a great quality to them, so you would think that the DVD would at least be better. Well, this DVD set has the worst picture quality I have every seen.The only redeeming quality was seeing John Wayne with Red Skelton.Recommendation: Don't buy."
1,Poor Customer Service,"When I contacted the seller with issues regarding this soldering station, I was referred to the Hakko factory. The factory told me that this seller is UNAUTHORIZED to sell Hakko equipment. The soldering wand cable was too stiff and the soldering tip did not fit properly in the supplied holder."
5,A Superior Product,"This soldering station is state-of-the-art. Temperature is maintained within a few degrees at all times, allowing faster soldering. Hakko sells a wide variety of soldering tips for $6 (or less) each. The ceramic heating element and temperature sensor system are used on some very high-end production grade soldering stations.I am an electronics technician and Amateur Radio operator. I use my 936 at home.Hakko is a Japanese company. My unit was made in Singapore."
5,love flying games,this is 1 of the best flying games iPad they make a few others but this is 1 of the hard to find it is a must buy they only make a few flying games not too many
5,Dope!,This is one of the best games fo the PS2 console! You can do things from sky canvas to adventure mode or just plain freeflight. Its a very cool game and you should buy it!
4,Great easy flying game...,"This is the kind of flight simulator I have been looking for! If I wanted all the knobs, buttons and gizmos true flight simulators have, I'd just get my pilot's license. This is just a fun and simple game. No fuss or messy keystrokes to remember. You can just throw the CD in and begin flying with easy to use controls and gorgeous graphics.I was also surprised at this game's long playability. There are so many levels and missions, that this game will have long lasting appeal. Also, I must admit I found myself drawn to the sky-writing exercises. I know how lame that might sound, but blowing smoke out the back of your plane while trying to make shapes and words was oddly addictive. I don't remember ever seeing that in other flight simulators.So, if you are real pilot, I am sure this game will disappoint. However, if you just want to fly around with ease while having a great time, this game is sure to please."
5,This Games Great.,"This game to me is very addictive. The game is very similiar to the pilotwings series on the nintendo, the main difference is you just fly planes. In this game you may not get to shoot or blow up things, but each mission is very different. From flying through caves, do mid-air refuels, finding lost ruins, or flying in horrible weather. The game overall in very enjoyable and will keep you on the edge of your seat. A must have."
2,Great Graphics - Reconfigure Your Sound!,"Great game, good graphics and gameplay, but no sound! Let me explain. If you've taken the time to hook up your PS2 to your digital sound system with an optical cable - don't buy this game! It doesn't support digital sound (as all of the 30 other PS2 and PS games I own do!)What a disappointment! No disclaimer on the box, but there is a note about the problem deep on the manufacturere's website!"
2,Leave this odyssey for Homer,"I saw all of the positive reviews of this game, and imagine my surprise when I found it for sale on the Used Games rack at my local Electronics Boutique! I was very excited, and I asked the clerk if he had played it, and he said no, so home I went to play for myself. There are many selections to make before playing. It seemed very complex, but I figured with all of these positive reviews, it must be worth it. I was wrong! Let me say, I usually only go for sports games, unless there is a noticible excception. This was not it. Very complex control system, and difficult to play. I only give it 2 stars because the graphics are very nice. If you are a sports gamer, don't waste your time. If, however, you are a pilot, or want to be one, then read the instruction book (twice) and jump in to this tedious, but good looking game."
1,Fundamentalist propaganda,"Be aware that this film was produced by fundamentalists and stacks the deck in their favor despite the cover's claim that it is a scholarly and scientific treatment of Jesus. If you are looking for a serious discussion of the issues check out these two books: ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel and ""Challenging the Verdict"" by Earl Doherty."
2,UMMMM,"I KNOW THE OLD SAYING ""TO EACH THEIR OWN"", BUT I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS. BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS IS THAT IT TASTED LIKE JARRED SAUCE. SAVE THE MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING FROM YOUR LOCAL GROCER."
4,Great comp even for college students!,"I got this computer for Christmass with a scaanner,and I can say this computer is great! It may not be the fastest or the most feature-rich,but it's great for everyday Linux computing with familes and students. I am a college student,and need a replacement computer to my older four year old Gateway. On a budjet,I couldn't afford to spend thousands on one so I bouught this one after reading good reviews. It works good on the internet with Mozilla. Faster then Internet Explorer! And the Lindows OS is much more usuable then Windows. When I wanted to play a game and finish my 2 page essay,it didn't crash not once,and was decently fast unlike Windows XP. The memory might be puny compared to the rest that run XP or maybe Mac OSX,but Linux doesn't need more then 64mb to run,so 128mb is more then enough! This computer in my oppinion will do just as good as the more expensive ones. Only thing it lacks a DVD or CDRW drive. If it had that,it'd be up there withthe rest!"
1,"Not the correct CD cover, songs are crap.","Thought I was purchasing this http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0000C0FIX/ref=dp_olp_used?ie=UTF8&condition;=usedThe picture is incorrect for this product. It goes with the one on the link above.This CD sounds like something you would hear in a mall. ugh!If you want to hear previews of the songs on this disc, go to allmusic . com"
4,Enhance your skills when you have no training partners!,"Of all the martial-arts writers, Mr. Christensen is one of the foremost sources on purely practical training for REAL COMBAT. He is a former Army military policeman (a Veitnam veteran), and a veteran of civilian law-enforcemnet. In many of his books he includes real-life accounts of violent encounters which he has experienced, utilized to illustrate a point in his discussion.This book is a collection of various drills, excercises, and the like to enhance your fighting skills when you have no training partner. The training you conduct alone is as important as that which you do with your classmates. As a previous instructor in Marine Corps close-combat, I found the drills described inside to be universal for anyone involved in some manner of martial-arts, whether it be tactical or sport oriented. READ THE OTHER BOOKS BY MR. CHRISTENSEN TOO!"
5,The Way Alone,"The Way Alone is a great read. It has very helpful information for beginner level martial artists to make the most of their time between classes. Mr. Christensen blends many techniques for improving every aspect of fitness, whether you're going for your next belt or training for a tournament."
4,good ideas book,"The book was actually thinner then I thought it would be, but it is a good introduction to things you can do on your own. If you are not able to spend as much time in the classroom as you want or want to improve what you are already doing, this book points you in the right direction."
2,Mediocre programs at best,"As a student of karate for 7 years and a Personal Trainer with 15 years of weight training and bodybuilding experience, I was disappointed with the very rudimentary information offered on all of the subjects within this book. One would be much better off locating other books covering such topics as mental training, weight training and general martial arts conditioning than going with ""The Way Alone"""
5,Wonderful Southern Desserts,"This is a fantastic cookbook. I am always asked for the recipe when I bring an item. These are old fashioned recipes that younger people will be completely pleased with but for older people, the recipes bring back sweet memories from their southern childhoods. I hear a lot of older people say, ""My mother used to make this"". The recipes are generally simple and if you don't know what pan to use, it probably doesn't matter. Although the cookbook is well organized and easy to read, for me, this cookbook is about the result of the recipes, not pitures or narratives. Highly recommend it. 5 stars all the way!"
3,Slightly disappointed but still optimistic!,"Having just received this book and immediately sat down to eagerly read, I must say that while the recipes read deliciously, I was disappointed that a few of the directions fell short by leaving out what type of pan and even what pan size would be required. This would not be the best book for a beginner, but most who bake often will be able to 'eyeball it' or make suitable estimations. There are, however, what appears to be a broad expanse of seemingly delicious recipes to choose from, but they lack what the authors' term ""discusses authoritatively the origin and current use of various types of desserts"", beginning each recipe with only short one liners and here-and-there short explanations of the origin of the recipes. I was really looking forward to that portion of the book, but despite the afore mentioned downfalls, I still look forward to the ""true"" test, that is, to actually try some recipes and see how really good they are."
2,did not meet my expectations,"I have been searching for a replacement for Fodgers Straight up Latte. Boy, this isn't it! I prepared it following directions and found it to be watery and without much flavor. There is a hint of chocolate in it which I did not expect, in this case that was a bad thing. My mother added it to her coffee (50/50 mix) and enjoyed it."
1,Not very pleased,"Though this backpack carries enough supplies for a day at work and two evening classes, it is very uncomfortable to wear. The back straps prevent my arms from moving freely and dig into my shoulders. I have worn it on one shoulder, but the weight distribution makes it heavy to carry. I have not had much comfort using this on a regular basis."
2,Great for tiny laptops,"Loved the backpack, but my Dell laptop (not a tiny one, granted) didn't fit. Would have loved to keep this backpack, but the sleeve was just too small. It might hold an IBM Thinkpad 600 or smaller, but my Dell wasn't even a close fit."
3,"Nice bag, but it's a big boy.","I was so excited to get my Back Office bag ... and I think it's great. But please keep in mind that's called Back **Office** for a reason -- it's as big as a corner one. Some people will love this, but for me, I thought the bag was a tad too wide and deep. Also, the padded computer insert is slightly different from the one in tbe pictures. It does not have a velcro fold over flap, leaving the part of the computer somewhat exposed inside the bag. Still, it's got lots of room for stuff and it's great for overnights and longer trips. It just may not be perfect for everyday commuting."
3,This Bag is Really Huge,"This bag would work well if you travel extensively. It does not work well on a daily to and from office basis. It is heavy when it's empty. However, it fit my laptop beautifully and the pockets are terrific. Just beware the size is formidable for every day use."
4,The Funniest Rankin Bass Xmas Special,"I thought I had seen all the Rankin/Bass animated Christmas specials until this year, when I happened to catch a rarely shown special entitled ""Jack Frost"". It's now my favorite! The offbeat humor is what makes it so great...Kubla Krauss and his sidekick Dommy are hilarious...and the song ""February 2"", sung by Buddy Hackett, is so insanely bad...I love it!"
2,Meh,"Cheesy, and wow - a giant advertisement for companies providing tours in New Zealand. Can't find a nice travel video of NZ that gives an overall scenic view of the country, with an emphasis on Auckland."
4,"Valor-iffic. A great little ""aliens can't fight so they get the barbaric humans to do it"" story","A good military sf story. On the edge platoon trapped on backward planet attacked by nearly unarmed natives, who won't stop. 4000 vs. 50. Good alien races, quickly and deeply described. Well done infantry battle, without being bogged down with too intricate detail, good main character. Essentially a further along ""aliens can't fight so they get the barbaric humans to do it"" story (with addition of a few other fighting races too) but better done than almost any other. Could be a great series, doesn't need a sequel, but there is one."
3,"Not the best, not the worst in Space Opera","This is an OK book -- I'll keep my copy -- but the space opera isn't quite as energetic as I like. I think there's an attempt to put some romance in, which sort of worked.I'm afraid the sex-between-not-quite-the-same-species stuff is getting out of hand, (Anne McCaffrey, Louanne Norman, and even CJ Cherryh do it too!), but at least Huff's characters aren't bondage victims like the latest Asaro book with the naked body builder on the cover. The military things Huff is doing must use British terms for officers though, and that can confuse a reader. The cover art on this book is a dog, BTW -- the book is much better than that! Call this a step up from Robert T. Sawyer's silly space station stuff and a step down from Doyle & McDonald, Lee & Miller, or CJ Cherryh."
4,very comfortable but not good for bulky stuff,"I like this bag a lot! My traditional backpack was killing me. The Monostrap is very comfortable in the way it's weight is distributed, and there's only one strap (of course).The bad thing: it doesn't hold much stuf. But I know I'm strange in this way. On any given day, I'm carrying several yo-yos, my journal, CDs & CD player w/ headphones... lots of odd-shaped items. The Monostrap would be fantastic for a laptop computer or other flat items.In the end, while I'm restricted in how much stuff I can carry, I prefer the comfort of the Monostrap over the standard backpack."
4,GOOD BAG/WRONG COLOR,"A FRIEND HAS YOUR BAG AND I HAVE USED IT TO COMMUTE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. IT WORKS WELL, THE BEST BUT I REALLY CAN'T USE IT IN THE COLORS YOU OFFER. WE NEED BLACK HERE IN NEW YORK, BLACK!NO WONDER IT SELLS SO WELL IN SEATTLE.LOVE YOU GUYS ANYWAY.TOM CLARK"
2,Ugly!,"The pictures of this bag look great on the web site. That's why I bought it. However, I was really shocked when I got the package and saw the bag. What the heck is the color! It doesn't look like what it shows on the site at all! Anyway, I am goign to return it tomorrow!"
4,"Handy, comfortable and durable","I just got one of these, and like it very much.I didn't notice from the pictures that the fold-over outer flap has two snaps that let you secure it to the base of the bag. The inner compartments are plentiful, I was able to stuff it with a raincoat, a couple of hefty books, a phone and a PDA, and assorted little things.I only really see a few bad points with it. The first is that the cell phone pocket on the strap will only really fit the modern small phones (my Nokia fits snugly), and that when you carry the bag without strapping into it, the phone pouch is just dangling on the hanging strap. If the phone isn't well secured, it can plop right out.The other problem is that I think the bag is very right-handed. Not a problem for me, but I think a lefty is going to want the weight of the bag on their right hip, and the phone pouch more available to their left hand."
2,Strap fell off!,The strap fell off about a week after I got it and all I was carrying was two textbooks and a newspaper! Hope the replacement they're sending me works out better.
4,Wonderful but not great,This book really helped with the progress of the game. I would most definately recommend this product if you have the game.
3,A Nice Little Tale!,"I just read this novel, and I had a great time reading it, although I was disappointed with its main focus. The story's plot was scattered from Luke and Charity's relationship to Jonah's condition to Vance's mischief to secrets hidden from the past... I'm not saying that I disliked the book; I just would have liked to hear more romance concerning Luke and Charity. I was also kind of turned off by the love scenes, because they were so overdramatic when told from Charity's point of view. ""Stars, moons, universes colliding"" is not usually my perception of sexual intimacy--but hey, maybe Luke was an even more exceptional guy than I thought!"
3,Predictable with a few turns,It's a shame that the back cover tells so much.There's no surprise. Most book covers are the same though.I enjoyed it.I didn't like the descriptions of lovemaking. I like to leave a few things to the imagination. I will be giving the book away to a charity or to the library. I don't want my teenage daughter to read it.
1,Ugh,"I don't know where all the good reviews are coming from. The story itself was boring. The hero, I actually liked. He stood up for himself the best way possible, each and every time.The heroine, however, was a spoiled little brat. I hated her, absolutely could NOT stand her. She was selfish, rude, bossy, and mean. I eventually just could not finish it, and started skimming about two-thirds of the way through."
3,A Nice Story!,"I enjoy Linda Lael Miller, but this one wasn't one of my favorites. I've read many of her books that are in series format, and prefer it to this. The story was nice, and the ending had a bit of a twist. It pretty much is as the synopsis describes."
4,Not as good as the debut...,"But still very good. This book almost seems like a rehash of the first book in some ways. Most notibly the annoying girl who follows D around the entire story. If you enjoyed the first book, or are a Vampire Hunter D fan in general... This book is worth your time. The next book, which was what the Bloodlust movie was based off of, should prove to be an even better read."
5,Jump Start Your Faith,The book provides a blueprint for accelerated spiritual growth. I enjoyed the practical nature of the layout and encouragement to watch for God's activity in everyday circumstances.
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting the book to reflect the title; hence, a ""surprise or lesson from God"" would occur everday for 30 days as Mr. Esau experimented with his two word prayer, ""Surprise Me"". However, as I continued to read, I simply learned more about his thoughts, family, and interests...I truly did not learn much from this experiment. The book almost seemed to be an autobiography on Mr. Esau. I did, in fact, find him to be a funny writer, a funny man (we share the same type of humor); however, I purchased the book in order to read about God's surprises in someone else's life besides my own, but all I rec'd was basically information on his daily routine in life. Should you wish to read something funny/hilarious, read any one of Laurie Notaro's books!! If you are looking for a ""surprise"" from an author, unfortunately Terry Esau is not the author you seek."
1,Must be a different God,"For the sake of honesty, I'll admit right now that I have read only the pages that are posted here on Amazon. That was enough, however, for me to encourage anyone interested in reading this book to first try the following: Read about Isaiah's reaction to an actual encounter with God in Isaiah 6:1-5. Compare Isaiah's reaction to statements in this book such as references to the Sovereign Creator God as ""Mr. Anti-Easy,"" (pg 16) and the attitude reflected in the words ""he'd better get used to [my saying] 'God, surprise me.'"" (pg 17)Something tells me Isaiah would not have been quite so bold!"
5,-Spokane...theres more where THAT came from...,"I've seen FFT progress through the past couple of years now. Its hard to get any attention when you live in Spokane, but hell... they are DEFINATLEY not the only talent in this town! There are so many bands in our area that could easily be signed to major labels. You have to work VERY hard to get noticed in Spokane. And Five Foot Thick did it. I knew they would. They are a VERY talented band who will make it far in this industry. But please, check out more bands from Spokane, there is something for everyone. You can find links for almost every band in Spokane on a local website at www.spokanebands.com please check out more bands in our area and help them out as well. There are a lot more bands that need a lot more attention!!! CONGRATULATIONS FIVE FOOT THICK!! WE LOVE YA!!xGARRETTx - a comfortable silencewww.acomfortablesilence.tk"
4,Heavy Duty Case,"I bought this case for my new i7 setup and it fit a full size motherboard, 3 hardrives, 2 ATI 5770's and a 750 Watt power supply, with room to spare. The build quality is pretty typical for commercial cases, all steel build which is nice but some sharp edges here and there, not quite as nice as Lian-Li but better than most.The case does tend to get hot when rendering in Maya or running games but if I can find small quiet fans to fit in back I think that will fix that.Perhaps there are smaller, nicer cases, but this one can hold any equipment you need and is very sturdy."
4,Comforting book,I was glad to have read this book after losing my friend to suicide. I liked the format of the book as printed sermons and it gave much comfort to my grief and hope.
2,Way Too Large,"Buyer beware. I'm a Kitchenaid fan but these tools, while sturdy and elegant, are much too large for normal kitchen pots and pans. The slotted turner dwarfs a 6 or 8 inch frying pan. Likewise the slotted spoon is unusable in less than a four quart saucepan."
2,Yes they're too large,"I've had these for years and hardly ever use them. They sit in the holder while cheap flimsy spatulas and spoons get used again and again. They're just too big and too rigid. I have lots of Kitchen Aid products, these are the only ones that aren't great."
4,specific information,"This book has very specific information on the topic. It defines working with pen and ink on a drawing board, not digital graphic arts and has ideas for marketing such original artwork."
2,"Lousy self-promoting, seminar style book","If you're looking for a book that was mostly written by someone other than Kendra, has information about housing markets that is outdated, and overall seems like a free seminar at a cheap hotel, then this book is for you."
1,"From the Person who said: ""Bubbles are for bathtubs!""",Shorting the real estate market at the release of this book would have been the smart play.The book is superficial and lacking in content. Not worth buying.
1,Why in the world would you take financial advice from this idiot?,"How does winning a reality game show qualify you for giving out real estate advice. Here is some good advice, buy a better book."
1,garbage,"This book was written in the style of a college kid's essay. Published in 2006, it suggests investing in the Vegas real estate bubble, which we all know has gone bust. I paid one penny for an autographed copy of this book. It was a waste of money."
1,Obviously an idiot,"What a terrible book. I cannot believe that anyone should have to suffer reading it. It is sad to think that many people will lose a great deal of money in the coming years based on taking such poor advice. A fool and his or her money are soon parted, say goodbye to your ARM!Do not worry, you can start over perhaps a little wiser..."
1,Much Better In-Print Books,"Steve Frey is a small man, with a big name and an even bigger ego. Before having to publish it himself he once wrote a now out-of-print book about a subject he enjoys to this day. However there are quite a few books, which have been better written and are AVAILABLE to this day. Frankly, one is given to wonder if there are those among the previous reviewers who might, perhaps, not exist at all in real life.True; not a nice thing to say. However the afore-mentioned ego of Mr. Frey does come though in his writings. And, in his work practices. I have also had the great displeasure of trying to deal with this individual on a business level and can assure you - a good businessman he is not.For my two cents, short and spiral bound about sums them up. Run, do not walk, away from this book and this person and find more modern, less self-absorbed, creations."
4,Good quality good price!,I have not installed yet but I like the quality of the rubber bushings which will fit nice on my Cadillac. I will purchase more for my other cars! Thanks.
5,beautiful!,almost like being in ROME without the long plane ride a fabulous red quality publication to proudly add to a table
2,Good pictures but ruined by the excessive glue,"Like most of National Geographic publications, this book has the flaw of excessive glue used in binding resulting in the center of two pages being glued together. It can not be spread apart without ruining the pictures.Interesting enough, this always happened at pictures of significance,which covers two facing pages, such as the creation of Adam from theceiling of sistine chapel,the School of Athens by Raphael, and many others. If you are like me who adores beautiful images or paintings andcan not tolerate imperfection, do not buy this book because most of thepictures are glued together in the central portion and can not be spread open without ruining it."
4,Beautiful Book,"Because this book is a National Geographic book, it has beautiful pictures which capture the various aspects of the Vatican life. In addition to the wonderful photographs, the author gives valuable information about the Vatican. The only thing that I could have wished for this book is to have more detailed history of the Vatican. This book gives the reader a great foundation for the intriguing place called the Vatican State."
5,The Church that Peter Built - a Pictorial of the Holy Sea,"The Vatican is the centerpoint for the world's Catholics and this is a picture book that captures the extraordinary architecture of Rome's most famous religious landmark. ""Peter built the church on the rock of our faith"" ... and what it became was The Vatican. Inside the Vatican is a stunning look at what happens when all roads lead to Rome."
4,Experience on using the Voicestation 300,"The Voicestation 300 is a good option for enabling conference on small-to-medium meeting rooms. The sound is crisp, as it is for all polystation products, operation is simple, and the price-benefit relation is very good.We are using a couple of these units for more than 6 months, with a great level of satisfaction."
2,Not exactly as advertised,Three of us had to huddle very close to the speaker to be heard by the folks on the conference call. Not even close to an excellent product.
2,Great speaker.... terrible Microphone,"I've used the Polycom 300 for about 6 months now and my experience has been very mixed. The sound from the speaker is great. However, everyone I speak to with this phone complains that my voice sounds like I'm talking from inside a sea-shell or a tin can.They have trouble hearing me and I find that I have to hold my head about 10 inches from the mic in order to be heard clearly. People hate talking to me when I'm on this phone.Unlike the digital polycom units, this one doesn't have external microphone inputs... so there's really no way to remediate the poor sound with a better microphone.It is what it is.My recommendation would be to consider other products before this one - or at the very least, wait for the price to go way down."
1,VoiceStation 300--A Dud,"I purchased a VoiceStation 300 for my home office in order to do business conference calls, and had to return it no more than 10 days later. People on the other end couldn't hear me unless I was inches away from the speakers, and my voice was constantly breaking up because the unit was picking up ambient noise from the heating system in the room. I was very disappointed in the performance of this product."
5,Great conference phone for small rooms!,I've purchased and installed several of these at work. They are very easy to setup and use. All you need is an active analog phone line (as found in most homes). The call quality is great for small-to-medium rooms! I have yet to be disappointed by Polycom products. Highly recommended!
4,Small-medium room use,"The use of the product was for a medium sized room. I did not set it up, I was the remote user. I think if it was more centrally located in the meeting room it would have had better results. The attendees speaking up would have also helped. But, it did its job with no problems."
4,A really cute show,"We don't get Syfy channel in deepest darkest New Zealand, but I had heard interesting things about this series and thought I'd give it a go.While it wasn't 100% what I was expecting, the humour more than made up for anything the show is lacking.Josh Gates is charismatic, and the show introduces legends not well known, and countries that are ill explored.A very light, paranormal show.Very enjoyable and recommended!"
4,Love this guy!,"While I love the 2nd and 3rd seasons more, my mom gave me this for my birthday and it was fun to revisit where it all started. I do think Josh and his team have it a bit more together in future seasons though. Josh really makes the show fun and entertaining!"
3,not-so-nice host,The host of these adventures narrates with a witty or sarcastic approach that fades into unnecessary disrespect toward the local people. Sometimes he seems to be trying to live up to the worst of the colonial era.
1,Really ????????,"Up until now many reviews on this site have been o.k as such, but I bought this DVD based upon the reviews and what waste of money ! The production is poor, the plans of action poor. For example who would travel half way round the world to explore something in no mans land and go out in the blue yonder without topping up the gas tank. They had this "" almost "" out of gas stunt a few times over and showing you the team boarding a small turbo prop aircraft to travel from the USA to a Pacific Island ! Leave it out, what a load of toffee. I figure the reviews came from the cast and crew. This just cannot be considered even amateur let alone serious. Oh and boys, if you want to catch something on film in the jungle, shut up !"
1,Destination nowhere,"I did like this show, and it WAS entertaining. But after half a dozen episodes, I realized I was watching nothing.They follow legitimate myths, which is their strength. But when it boils down, there is never anything there but some hooligans and an acting crew.Sorry Josh, but I had to tell 'em."
5,Keeper,"Love the series and love the DVD. Now I can watch Josh and the gang anytime I want to. This refreshing look into the world of superstitions, paranormal activities and monster sitings always is entertaining from Josh Gates' great sense of humor and the researchers' wary approach to each new adventure. And adventures are what they are on. If you like any of the above subjects, you'll enjoy this DVD. Not your same old monster hunt."
5,Destination Awsome,"Our children absolutely love Josh Gates (OK, so do my wife and I). Our kids are 2,7 and 14, and they all love the show. The humor of Josh makes it work for all of us. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a kids show. Sometimes the younger ones have to hide their eyes. It can get a bit creepy for them.Josh leads a team of investigators searching for the truth about rumored legends around the world. They travel the globe, which is great for the kids to see. My kids love to see the world maps, the locations and the indiginous people. In a strange way it's actually educational. It can be frightening at times with creatures in the woods in the middle of nowhere, but Josh keeps it light and funny in the face of fear, which for me, is another good lesson for our younger generation.It's fun and interesting, even if they never actually prove or disprove anything. Watch for Josh. BTW, my 7 year old rated it ""all 5 stars!"""
5,glad to finally get it on dvd!,"This is such a great show. Some of the funniest things youll see throughout the seasons are the vehicles they use for travel in foreign countries. They ALWAYS breakdown! Often times on their hunts they dont find anything, but its so entertaining to watch them anyways! I'll be buying every season they release!"
5,Josh Gates is a trip...,"...and a great entertainer. He makes his show, Destination Truth, a treat not only for lovers of cryptozoology but for those looking into the ghostly realms too. Josh and his crew trote the globe seeking the weird and the strange, and then bring it to you, via the SciFi channel. Very entertaining!"
5,Finally!,"Quite excited that this product is available and look forward to all seven full seasons being published on DVD by Paramount.Also, check out ""The Complete Mission: Impossible Dossier"" by Patrick White.ps - Not a fan of the movies"
5,Mission Impossible Seasons 1 - 3,I have always been completely satisfied with anything I've ordered fromAmazon. I ordered these DVDs for a Christmas present. I did open one and played the first program as I wasn't sure what the quality would be. It was all I could ask for even though the TV show was taped in the 60's.
3,"It's ok, I guess","Well, actually, it's kind of ugly. It has this weird grey piping around it that -- while you can see it in the pictures -- is actually much more pronounced than that, and really ugly.safety? I don't think so. Too small. Aesthetic? Uh, no. I think I am going to take a black magic marker to it. Secondly, the internal pouch for the laptop is rather small -- my IBM 460 barely squeezes in it at all. Really have to work to get it in or out.Third, it's floppy. Maybe that is the way a messenger bag has to be, but, well it is a little more floppy than I want.Finally, it's expensive. I mean $40! I want something really great for that kind of money.So, is there anything good? Sure. It's got lots of usefull little pouches and pockets, which is how I like to organize my world. It does slap comfortably across my back and stick where I want it while riding. So, I don't think it is the organizional foundation upon which I will found the rest of my life, but it is ok."
1,I HATE this bag!,"I was really excited when I first got this bag, but since have grown to hate it. I have a Dell laptop, relatively light weight and I carry my computer in this bag at all times. But it has terrible weight distribution! In fact, my shoulder was hurting so much after one flight that I checked my laptop in my luggage to avoid using this bag. Poorly designed! Do not buy this bag if you plan to carry your laptop. It just was not designed properly for it! I now have the latest Eddie Bauer bag and am very pleased. Anyone want a slightly used Amazon bag? (ha ha)."
4,Excellent multi-purpose bag!,"I'm not a biker but bought the bag anyways, because I needed a cool, handy bag to carry my PowerBook, PDA and loads of other stash.I find it very cool indeed and pleased that my PowerBook fits snugly inside. (at times I wonder if it was designed for the PowerBook)My only qualm is that the awkard top bit of the flap folds up when u carry it. I'm sure that there could be a workaround.Other than that, I love the bag. It's brilliant and it's got Amazon.com on it! Yippeeee!"
4,Just what I ordered,Decent coverage and review of the GTO for most enthusiasts. Background information and pictures are clear and well presented. Another great addition to my collection.
4,Great ideas for bags.,This book book had some really great ideas for bag making. I really enjoyed it. Would recommend this to a friend.
5,A Must Buy!,This firepit is awesome! Much deeper than most pits. No problems putting it together. We have had many compliments on how nice it looks.
1,Poor Product and the Manufacturer Knows It,"Like the former reviewer, I also would like to give the product a zero rating, but one was the lowest available to me. I echo all her sentiments and would like to add two additional comments. First, the writing in the instructional manual for this device was atrocious; it was full of errors as well as confusing due to poor construction. Second, the tech support line for this product is nothing more than an employee fielding complaint calls. There was no effort made to help me solve the technical problems I was experiencing; the way the call was handled led me to believe that the whole operation was a sham. The only help they would give was to offer to, ""look at the device if I sent it to them and they would replace it IF they could re-create the problem I described"". At that point, we saw no reason to mess with the company and simply sent the devices back to Amazon for a refund."
2,Crappy Support,"I don't know who wrote the English directions for this product but they suck-there is hardly any info at all- my product did not come with any info as to how to get in touch with the company if there were problems on the pc. Don't even hope for troubleshooting advice.My windows XP keeps asking for some disk that didn't come with the device. The only disk that came with it was driver for win 98. Of course there is no number, email or snail mail addy to use to ask for help.I wish I would have spent a little more money to buy a name brand MP3 player."
1,Broke on day three,"I was satisfied with the product - until I actually used it in the real world. The second day I carried it in my pocket (with nothing but my cell phone knocking against it), the glass screen cracked and broke apart. In my pocket. Guess what happened when I reached my hand into my pocket which now had bits of broken glass into it?The third day I was using the Machspeed Trio was when it died. I put some documents onto the drive and went to Kinkos to get them printed. When I gave the clerk the drive, he was unable to get information off it. He couldn't even get it to register in the computer. He tried it in four different computers, and none of them worked. He gave it back to me, and I couldn't even get it to turn on. I changed the batteries - no good. It just died.Thanks, Machspeed Trio. I really enjoyed your product for about 18 hours. But $30 for 18 hours isn't enough.Please don't buy this product."
3,Technology Schmechnology,"It's small and matches my cell phone. But, looks aren't everything! The only real complaint that I have is that it eats up batteries at an amazing speed, faster than the record hot dog eater. I probably should have invested in one with a charger or something but this MP3 player was the right price. Besides the battery issue, everything else is great - very easy to use and the color background is an awesome effect."
4,Good product. Not intutive,"Gives great audio output from recording. But the system is not intutive. A manual is a must. Otherwise, I'm quite happy with the product."
3,cheap plastic and poor programming,"This mp3 player has served me well, it is nice that it can be used as a thumb drive and an mp3 player simultaneously, you don't have to format it like you would a true-blue player. The programming on the player is kinda crappy, which makes the user interface inconsistent and hard to use sometimes, especially when navigating your music library. I do like the price and the memory capacity, and you can change the EQ settings and play configuration and backlight like any other player. The backlight is stuck on, but it doesn't seem to affect the battery life that much. I had it in my pocket with something else and I shattered the plastic over the screen... no biggie, the body does seem cheaply made though. You get what you pay for, but so far I have been satisfied, still works like a charm after 6 months."
3,machspeed,doesnt take all the music files my daughter has. a little complicated to operate goes though a lot of batteries
3,Fair performance,First mp3 player I own. Headphone caps came apart after 3 days of use. Battery lasts as indicated in User's Manual. When power is low it tends to behave erratically
3,Slightly Irritated,"I just received this product today and I am slighty disappointed already and I haven't even used it yet. The product description says it comes with a neck band thing so it can hang from your neck, but there was not one in my package. Also, the earphones that cames with it have a short in them. Because of this, the cord must be angled just right so the audio does not cut out or sound as if it's under water."
1,DON'T BUY,This thing is a piece of junk.It stops working in between of a song for no reason.u can get a better mp3 player if you are spending this much.
3,Screen broke,This product was a present for my brother and he broke the screen after having it for two weeks.
1,BUYER BEWARE,We bought 3 of these units as gifts. We were only able to get 2 functional (much time/effort; concerned about compromise to computers we used to do this). We sent the 3rd one back for refund to TigerDirect. What a hassle getting to talk to someone and following their procedure for refund! They refunded us ONLY $11 of the $35 we spent. Why? I have no idea but you can bet we won't be making any more purchases through them.
1,Cheap-go with something with a little more quality,"This is a very CHEAP player. I bought 2- one for my wife and 1 for myself. the faceplates of both broke within a few weeks. In both cases, my wife and I just had them in our pockets and our keys (I guess) broke the faceplates.Also, if you listen to longer podcasts or ebooks and turn the player off, it does not start where you stopped it at. The navigation is difficult. Another problem is that the microphone button is in a bad location and I constantly hit it and it is difficult to get it to stop and change back to the player. Overall, avoid this player"
2,you get what you pay for,"Uploading music was easy on this mp3 player, but then very difficult to operate the player and play the music. I was about to give up, assuming the play button was defective but then I realized it just needed a very quick tap. I was pushing the button down too hard and I'm guessing that's why the mp3 player appears to be defective to others when it just requires a lot lighter touch and a bit of wait time until it loads. So while this player gives you what it advertised, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a lot of patience (the instructions do suck). You get what you pay for."
4,a bargain...,"For a mp3 player / recorder / thumb drive this price and for 1GB, this is a good bargain, but there's always room for improvement:1) ear buds: without cushions, it will always fall from your ears;2) the headphones cable sports a ""heart"". What was that?3) not much contrast from the LCD.4) only red colour.Despite the aforementioned, I liked the sound, the EQ options are quite good. And - important - it has a USB connector - a plus!"
1,The quality isn`t good. It`s difficult to use.,I have 2 of them. One stop working after 1 month of use. It`s difficult to go from one menu to another and use it in general.
3,Not for the Slow,Machspeed Trio produces great sound but selecting playmode is a bit cumbersome. Earphones are a bit short for anything active.
1,"Same product, different name.","I bought this same MP3 player, only it was marketed under a different name. It worked awesome for about two months and then started shutting itself off and on continually until the battery dies. When I called tech support they essentially said ""tough luck."" Mine looks EXACTLY the same but is silver and has the manufacturers name ""Kanguru."" I wouldn't recommend it and I hope that the Coby 2GB that I'm thinking to buy doesn't do the same thing to me."
4,easy listening,[[ASIN:B000B5SLSM Machspeed Trio 1 GB MP3 Player Voice Recorder Thumb Drive)]A big improvement over earlier releaseI listen to mp3 books. You can stop and start back up exactly where you stopped. Previous models would start back up at beginning of mp3.
4,worth the price,"two were purchased, one was without necessary firmware, one was complete, the firmware had to be downloaded and installed from online, through manufacturer, most memory for price that i found."
1,Machspeed Trio 1GB is the slowest device ever,"This device its suposed to be USB 2.0 That means that a single 4MB mp3 file would take about a second to transfer. Oh no, it doesn't. It takes about 8 or 10 seconds per track. Now, multiply that for some 200 songs? Ridiculous. However, Amazon has nothing to do with this total failure."
2,Not worth the price,This MP3 player is trash. The battery dies every other day. Half the time it shuts off for no reason. Can not get the voice recorder to even work. It holds the songs and it sounds great when it actually works.
1,STAY AWAY,"This was the worst thing I ever purchased from Amazon. At first listen it sounded great but when I hooked it via the USB port to my computer all it did was search, no drive icon came up. Could never get it to load files or music. After trying for hours via the sucky manual and online help I finally gave up and am in the process of returning it as defective. Absolutely horrible experience. This should be a discontinued item. I also should be able to give this no stars."
1,Sucks big time,"I give this product a one star rating because there's no option for zero. Got one for myself and my husband and as soon as it arrived I immediately put it to use. it was working great, i even fell asleep listening to it, up till the following morning when i changed the battery and then the damn thing wouldn't play. It got stuck at menu and non of the buttons were working worst of all it wouldn't turn on at all after an hour no matter how many batteries i replaced it with. This product is not worth $39.99, a dollar or even this web page that it's on. will never try an off brand again."
2,Poor Construction,"I purchased this mp3 player due to the price....and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.Overall I find the player poorly made. Somehow, dust has gotten on the underside of the plastic shielding which covers the LCD. This has made it very difficult to read. Additionally, the button to select items in the menu has gotten extremely touchy and normally registers two ""button presses"" when I press once.There are many better mp3 players out there with more capacity and features for the same or less cost. I have relegated this one to a thumb drive."
5,A Beautiful Mind - Shooting Script,I use this script to teach screen writing. It is a small size and easy for students to carry.
2,Sadly Disappointing,"This book was purchased with the belief that in this book was something extra or to be read in addition to their online documentation. Under the book description you can see it says that it includes the following books from the Macromedia online documentation. In reality, this book doesn't include them - but contains them. That's all you get here. The freely available PDF files in a book format with nothing added and nothing removed. A disappointment from a company like Macromedia that they wouldn't offer further information on the developing process for extending one of their flagship products."
5,Great Sunglasses!,I purchased these sunglasses for my fiance for Christmas and he LOVES them. They are very stylish and look great with everything! He's not in to flashy things and didn't want something that was too trendy. These sunglasses allow you to still be trendy but not too over the top. We had origanally seen the sunglasses at the mall with a price tag of $290 so it was great to find them on Amazon for way cheaper (Thanks Paris Miki) :) The fit is great and so is the sun protection. I think that anyone that looks great in aviator style sunglasses would look great in these.
2,iSkin,"I've been using this for quite a while now.The main reason I keep it on is to protect the Nano, when it drops to the floor. The problems with this product are: makes the controls Much less sensitive, glow in the dark feature not very good, interferes with connections. I've only used the clip feature maybe once or twice."
4,marvin at his best,"""point blank"", ""prime cut"" and ""the killers"". all trim, tough lee marvin roles. marvin and gulager are excellent as partners. with one of the best ending lines ever!!"
4,Worth the price if you use NIV translation.,"The Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek dictionaries are done very well, compared to the old Strong's Concordance I have."
4,great resource,The book served as a great resource guide.The downside was very thin pages which caused images to bleed through.I would rather pay extra to have better quality.
3,Great Resource Book,"This book has so much information but I didn't find it easy to use. An experienced Concordance user would find this book very useful, but it is not recommended for the beginner without someone to help navigate through it."
5,Exactly what I needed,My dad wanted a Stong's concordance for the NIV bible. I searched and found this one. It was just what he wanted.
4,complete refrence but huge,"book is very complete and helpful, but not too portable at the huge size. maybe a computer version would work better (if you have a laptop or palm)"
1,The binding is off!!!,"I was excited to get this and begin using it during my Bible study time, but the last section of the concordance is bound wrong and you can't see the entries. This was supposed to be a new concordance and I paid full price but got a defective product. It is disappointing."
5,Best of the best!,They took James Strong's classic and computer verified the findings. Best match for the KJV for serious bible students.
5,Excellent Concordance!,"Every christian who is serious about their relationship with God should have this exhaustive concordance! If you are longing to delve into deeper study of the scriptures, then this is the reference book to find any biblical topic that might grab your attention. I often use it to search for specific topics to put together daily bible studies. It could easily be used for so many other ways of learning the Bible. It is an excellent tool for the spiritual war chest. Get one! And buy a friend one as a gift!"
3,"Decent intro, but too much filler.","This is a decent introductory book, but feels like a double-spaced term paper trying to hit a page count.It covers every aspect and seems as good a place to start as any. Don't try to read it through - use it as a reference book, and skip around to what you need.It is filled with screen shots (that are always on the next page) and one of those 50-page appendix lists that should be online."
5,The best I've seen on this subject.,"Granted, there are not a great many books on this subject, but this is definitely the one to read. It gives great insight on the benefits and pitfalls of advertising on this new medium. It does an excellent job of comparing the internet to other advertising options and makes a good case for which traditional advertising concepts apply here, and which do not. I am an advertising and media buyer working exclusively with interactive appliances and I found this book immensely informative. Read it."
5,A Great Introductory Book,"I'm launching a site soon, and this book has given me a great introductory grasp of web advertising. You'll find out how to design advertisements, price, measure results, sell/buy, etc. Also includes an appendix of useful contacts. The best book I have read thus far on web advertising."
3,Good for people new to advertising..,"Overall, it was a nicely done book but it was trying to teach me alot of stuff that I already new. I was looking more in to what there survey's and results from users said and there wasn't enough good information that way. If you don't know what CPM is then you should get this book because your new to internet advertising."
4,"Dated, but the principles still apply","First off, this book could use a refresh, but it's still one of the best display advertising (i.e., banner ads) books out there. I'm actually a bit surprised there isn't a new version. It contains all the ins and outs of planning and placing banner ads and other digital advertising opportunities for its time."
2,Poor grammar,"This book is full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. For example: roll playing, instead of role-playing; technic, instead of technique. It also makes extremely poor usage of pronouns and direct and indirect articles throughout the entire book. I can only assume it was not reviewed by a competent editor prior to being published. I have no formal English language training beyond the high school level, yet I found it frustrating to read the book. Fortunately, it is a quick read. It took me all of thirty minutes to read the book from cover to cover. Most of the information contained in the book is common sense, but there were a few things my wife and I might not have thought of on our own. If you can get past the poor grammar, it is a worthwhile read. Is it worth buying? No, I would recommend getting it from the library or buying it used."
5,Powerful ansd informative,The book gets strait to the meat ant holds your attention until the ending. Maurice Woodson did a wonderful Job. I recommend this book very much.
3,Maybe not great for every day use - at least not for Ceilie!,"Ceilie is our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix who is feeling her years! We started giving her these tablets once a day and she seemed to love them for the first week. After that, she really didn't want to take them any more and seemed very reluctant to put them in her mouth. Indeed, we'd noticed that she'd been a bit gassier but the last time we finally encouraged her to eat one she brought it back up within minutes. Maybe it was just too much for her delicate tummy. Really, I think they gave her heartburn!Every once in a while we give her one as a sort of ""booster"". She doesn't seem to have a negative reaction to the occasional supplementary use. For daily therapy, we give her the Happy Hips duck or chicken jerky treats sold by Dogswell. Amazon carries these treats and offer great prices for them. She has responded extremely well to the Happy Hips products, loves them, and they don't upset her tummy!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I've tried several brands of Glucosamine. These are very chalky. My dog wouldn't eat them and after I tried crushing and mixing them in with her food, she refused to eat it. The container looks suspicious to me. The label is cheap paper and it appears like someone printed it off their home computer and pasted it to the jar. I'm going back to Phycox soft chews. They are worth the extra money."
1,Other options for Glucosamine Chondroitin,I've used other products for years with my elder dogs and really seen the my pets' health improve.This product is like many manufactured for pets and humans that promotes the harvest of shark fins that isn't necessary to produce the desirous effect of improved joint health. There are many products out there that deliver Glucosamine Chondroitin without involving shark cartilage. Your pet benefits with improved joint fluid and the sharks of the oceans are not slaughtered for their fins if you choose wisely. Read the label.
1,Correct dosage,"How many mg of glucosamine is in this product? Can't find it anywhere in the site. Product could be a great deal if the mg content is adequate, 500 mg or more."
3,Doesn't Taste Like Bacon,"The product may be effective, but it doesn't smell like bacon. My dog certainly doesn't think it tastes like bacon. On the bright side, it crumbles easily, and my dog accepts it when powdered and mixed with his food. I doubt that many dogs will accept it as a treat."
5,Works wonders,My german shepherd could barely walk and glucosamine allowed him to run again. I believe that this product extended his life for another year or so. I would definitely recommend it
1,Installation Nightmare,"While the concept is a wonderful idea, unless the average consumer is an electronic wizard and can install themselves, finding anyone to install it is next to impossible. Most auto repair facilities will not install it and stereo installation facilities will charge an average of $60 per hour with 4-6 hours estimated. Contact with the manufacturer was of no help. Installation in manual shift cars is prohibited. Installation in automobiles with computer systems has caused many problems. Additionally, fires have been reported. At the present time, I am waiting for Return Autorization from Amazon for the two that were purchased."
3,Useful,"As a Middle School teacher I hoped to gain new insight on my student's age group, and ""Yardsticks"" does offer some comforting advice to teachers and parents. (It's not just me, it's their age!) It's a quick and easy read. I would have wished for more pointers and detail, but it offers an accessible overview."
5,"Excellent for ""At-Your-Fingertips"" Information!",As a school counselor and a classroom teacher I found this a wonderful resource for finding quick information on the developmental stages children go through. Each staff member at our school was given a copy and we discussed it at staff meetings. Everyone seemed excited to have such an easy-to-read book that was packed with such valuable information. It has helped teachers to understand that often children are just behaving according to their developmental age! I'd recommend it to all educators and parents!
4,great application for future teachers,I'm using this book in a teacher's ed class at Saginaw Valley. Haven't had to do anything with it in class but I have skimmed through it so far and it seems like there are a lot of great applications in it for future teachers. Looks like it will be an excellent addition to my ever growing library for my future career. Would recommend it.
2,Good for a subpoputlation,"If you are of a certain mindset, this is probably an excellent book. But if you can't buy into all the premises, which I couldn't, it is unsatisfying. But it is a decent read."
4,Unspeakable,"Evil may seem to be an old fashioned word in this relativistic age where the only absolute truth, many contend, is that there is not absolute truth. It is that attitude that lets evil spread. Using the past as illustrations, Mr. Guiness confronts our attitudes about evil. Correcting them is the key to dealing with evil in the best possible way. By asking seven incisive questions, he takes readers on a journey that will lead them to an apprehension of this enemy and, hopefully, to make a difference in their own hearts.**** Yes, the book is slanted towards a Christian world view, but he does present other views as fairly as it is possible for a committed Christian to do. Though the answers are staunchly Christian, they are presented logically enough that it is hard to imagine that a non Christian reading this would be offended. Reading a book won't cure the evils of life, but it might help you face them better. ****"
2,can ANYONE make a good torch?,"I bought two, and they work fine for about a month, though the flame was a bit too big. First the sparker goes bad, then the trigger. I've tried four different trigger style, three pencil style, all go bad so fast. I guess the plain old big 14oz. tank of propane but with a pencil type tip is still most reliable though bulky. Dials right down and way cheaper than butane."
3,LOGO WARNING!!!!!,This would have been a good collection of Skelton shows if not for the Platinum Disc logo which ruins the viewing experience. The quality is good and the shows have original commercials and appear complete. Platinum Disc's despicable practice of using logos is the only cause for the low rating I gave the disc. There is a 2-disc set by Diamond Ent. that has shows that look good with no logos.(The Red Skelton T.V. Show-Collector's Edition)
4,Beginner working with the book.,"Let's clarify a few things:First off someone has a selling price of 89.99 posted which is absurd unless it includes the DVD. You can buy a new copy of the book for a heck of a lot less from the web site.Second, Jamie Andreas is a woman, however for whatever reason, her assistant, partner, whoever often comments on the web site, etc. so it's confusing whether a man or woman wrote this book. The web site is one of the best out there,chock full of good advice. Third many complain the book is geared towards""classical players"" partially true, yet there is a section on how to play with a pick. Fourth, while I haven't purchased the DVD, I suspect it's a great supplement to the book. All that being said, yes, it's awfully cluttered at times, perhaps not properly edited, etc but can be a useful practice tool and certainly a book one must continue to read and re- read for maximum absorption. The DVD is quite spendy however I'll assume a visual teaching tool cuts to the chase."
3,halucinations,"i am not reviewing the book. i am wondering if my memory fails me. i suspect that the author is a competent teacher/player. it is just that i thought that when i first discovered ""correct principles"", that the author was a male. i hope to not offend anyone so please forgive if so. can anyone clarify this issue?"
1,Not exactly what I expected. It's a bunch of Crap.,"Though there's nothing technically WRONG with this publication, 90% of it is a lot of 'Tony Little' style 'self help' propaganda. ""PAY ATTENTION....No really....pay CLOSER ATTENTION....no I mean it....FOCUS"" seems to be the overhyped tone of 90% of the advice and 'technique' given. ""Relax your fingers!"".....Uh..yeah..sure. ""Keep your upper body straight!""....Ummm...REALLY?For me it was a complete waste of money. I seriously suggest you skip this book.If you want it, I'll leave it in the middle of my front lawn for you. Don't ring the bell."
1,Tension is the Enemy......,"...well, I think this book could've stopped right there. I found it tedious and only marginally helpful. I wouldn't buy it again. The main takeaway for me was the conscious effort to avoid muscle tension."
4,Helpful booklet,"This isn't a hard cover book. It's actually a booklet about 100 pages long.A total of 106 pages including the glossary, 6 pages of index, and lots ofpages of photographs. There are people who swear by it, so I'm hoping itlives up to its reputation. Other books I ordered arrived so much fasterthan the three weeks it took for this to get here from a town about 5 hoursaway that I was unimpressed with the service, although the email fromcustomer service was friendly and reassuring. I'm just glad its finallyhere and will help me play the guitar better faster."
5,Rudy Vallee,"Dr. Demento playes a selection from this one. ""There Is A Tavern In The Town"" in which the old crooner found the lyrics wickedly funny. Each take he would break up and finally the control room allowed him to run through the song. After he broke up, the band members began laughing through their hornes and trying to further crack him up which they did and it's a one of a kind fun filled musical treat."
3,"coffee filters, shipping cost more than filters, buyer beware","coffee filters, shipping cost more than filters, buyer beware.these can be found at places like world market, cost plus, specialty stores. where you do not need to pay a shipping cost that is more money than for an item."
2,Wouldnt recommend,I really didnt care for this horror anthology. There were no stories that reached out and grabbed me by the back of the neck. Usually I read through these kind of anthologies in about a month or so but I've owned this book for a couple years and still havent managed to work my way through all the stories in it so maybe there are some gems hidden away somewhere?
5,Beautifully written novel.,"This book is a very beautifully written coming of age novel. I would recommend it to every teenager as a very good perspective on growing up, having a serious boyfriend, and adultery, among other themes.The Perfect Age ranks in the top five on my list of favourite young adult fiction. After I closed the book, I thought, ""Helen isn't real. These characters aren't real."" It was the first time the thought had occurred to me, and it struck me as wrong somehow. These characters were so real to me that it struck me as bizarre that they weren't actually living in Las Vegas, working at the Dunes.I read this almost straight through. Everything was so beautiful and lyrical that I just couldn't put it down. It was unique, mostly. Amazing book, every teen should read it."
1,"A slow read, and quite boring",The story began very slow. Explaining the characters and how they all fit together. But NOTHING captured me into this book. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. I struggled to keep reading. The author could have summed this book up in about 100 pages or less. Conversations seemed to be too short as though they were unfinished. This book was just way too drawn out for me...and plain ol' boring.
2,good for begineer only,"I had a little biped experience before reading this book and have learnt nothing new from it. Only buy if you are a complete beginner. Nicely laid out, clear and well explained."
5,great book!,"Like other reviewers say, a lot of the 3ds Max books leave a lot to be desired.. but this one is truly exceptional. The lessons are well articulated and the tutorials have all the steps explained. The only cautionary points i would make are 1) the book was written for 3ds Max 8 so it is aging a little and 2) to follow along you will need to know the 3ds Max interface already.. the book assumes a basic knowledge of Max... so if you are a total Max beginner, you should start with something else."
5,Fan-ta-bulous....,"Ok, let me start by saying, it's creative. It's different but in a good way. It was hard to believe that after hearing the entire cd from start to finish without once having the urge to skip a song, that Edie Sedgwick (aka Justin Moyer of El Guapo) not only is, in my perspective, a cross between Eminem's constant criticism towards celebrities except with smarter politically driven remarks and the equavalency of David Bowie's 80's work performed by Kraftwerk and sung by Perry Farrell. He is a one-man show since he's traveling band is an iPod. The drag is a bit much, I actually wish it were less sloppy and much more glamorous, but that's all part of the show. The songs feel shorter in length then they are which is good in a way since they are stuffed with beats that sometimes overpowers your own thoughts. I did catch myself however singing them out loud and eventually wondering which of the songs is not only the stupidest but also my favorite off the album. Enjoy."
2,Sound is good but plays most mp3's terrible.,"I have this thing hooked up to my Delphi SkyFi XM Radio unit and I get good sound however I have to give you a warning. This thing plays most mp3's terrible. Any mp3's that are encoded using the LAME Encoder will play terrible there is a loud screeching noise that will keep playing, on my cheap mp3 cd player I get a annoying churp but on this one it is just let you say you can't listen to the mp3's. Any mp3's that are encoded without LAME otherwise play fine. Since I got it for mp3's I am kinda annoyed that I can't listen to most of them."
5,Handy and Effective,"I've been using this tool for about a year now and it works like it's supposed to. Usually makes a nice, clean cut after a few twists around the bottle in each direction. I like the shape: since it's round and open-ended, I can store it on a hook or handle."
1,Overpriced Junk,"Like the Bontempi Saxophone, this toy was pitched as a sort of ""intro to music"" instrument. There's not a shred of educational value to this. My kid played with it for about 3 minutes. It sounds horrible and you can't even blow through it without pressing at least one key. Like the Bontempi Saxophone, this should be sold at Cracker Barrel for 5 bucks."
2,Brittle plastic toy,"This is a really cool toy, but very cheaply made. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He opened it at 10 AM on Christmas Day and by 4 PM the end that you blow in was broken off. My son was really disappointed. It put a damper on our Christmas. If your kids are really easy on toys this may be for you, but it didn't last even a day with mine."
5,Entertaining,This looks pretty cheap--cheap plastic and all but sounds really good. The kids really love it and even though they can't quite master all the keys it sounds relatively good!
5,Great Trumpet to play with.,We got this for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. The trumpet has 4 valves to play and all you do is blow into the mouth piece and the valves make the sound. It is very easy to play. It is made of plastic. This would be a great toy for any young child that likes to play with instruments.
3,Fun but not durable,"Our 4 yo daughter wanted a ""horn"" so we chose this Bontempi trumpet. She hasn't been rough on it, but two of the four buttons have now broken off, which is annoying but also concerns us as we also have a younger child. (Yes, there is a choking hazard warning on it, but this toy IS for young children so I feel the buttons should be more durable. Even below one of the tags is ""toddler music."" This toy is NOT for toddlers.) As others have said, it sounds like a harmonica. BUT it did teach her to blow AND push the buttons at the same time to make a noise, rather than other instruments we've had which don't require even basic instrumenting skills to function, just button-pressing. Debating, though, about just trashing it rather than waiting to see what happens with button #3."
3,Easy to play trumpet,My son received this as an x-mas gift and loves it. It's easy to play and sounds good. Young kids can get the feel of a trumpet without having to struggle with playing clear notes. Great introduction to musical instruments for children.
2,"Looks like fun, but not very good quality","My daughter asked for a trumpet for Christmas. She's only four, but she loves musical instruments. She takes good care of her toys, so we were both diappointed when one of the knobs broke off within a few days. She thought it was really great until this happened...I'm disappointed with the quality of the purchase."
2,Cheap,My son wanted this for play. It did not last long. Maybe three weeks of VERY light play. It fell apart quickly.
5,3 year old loves it!,"My little girl only wanted a ""horn"" for Christmas. This was perfect for her and she is still playing with it!"
3,Attractive looking toy only!,"I was pleased with the way the toy looked but upon trying to play music according to the included color keyed music chart we found it hard to make clear musical notes and the sound coming out wasn't very good overall. If I hadn't gotten a good bundle price for 3 toy instruments I would be very displeased about it, but as it turns out they make some cute noisemakers to play with. With the amount of styling that went into making the toy it seems more effort could be put into the actual use to make it more engaging for children."
1,"cheap, item, over priced.","This toy trumpet is a cheap item. It is overpriced @ 41.00. It *might* be worth 5-10 dollars at most. Low quality. I expected more, and was very disappointed."
5,"Excellent Starter ""Instrument""","I purchased this for our 3 year old son. He loves music and I wanted to get him a start in 'feeling out' music. He loves it! We picked it up at our apartment office and immediately opened it. He was playing it the whole 5 minute walk home. As other reviewers have stated, it is a harmonica based instrument so you can't pick it up and blow expecting it to work as a real trumpet (need to press a key). There is not many 'songs' you can play with just the four notes (like 'Merrily We Roll Along' or 'Twinkle Twinkle'). But we study different classical composers and he has had a great time playing along with classical songs. Our son loves this, is not gentle with it and it still is in great condition 4 months later. VERY durable. Highly recommended for the child who has an interest in music."
3,It's cheaply made for the money,"My son got this for his birthday. Considering how much it cost, I was expecting something that is better made. The plastic is thin and cheap. The prices here on Amazon are higher than other stores. I did an internet search and found it for half of what people are selling it for here, and even that is too high a price.The sound of the trumpet isn't too loud, which is a plus, and my four year old has no trouble forcing air through it and making it play. My complaint is strictly with the quality. I don't see this being a toy that lasts very long."
3,Fun but low quality,"My 3 year old has loved this trumpet for 4 months now. It is great for pretend play, but since the silver color has already worn off, I'll be shocked if it survives to his next birthday.Pros:- large size (like a real trumpet)- sounds are relatively quiet and melodious (nice for parents)- hasn't shattered when tossed on the floorCons:- silver color rubs off easily, revealing black plastic beneath- child must press the keys while blowing into horn to make any sound at all- has 4 keys, not 3 like a real trumpetMy child usually holds it up to his mouth and hums into it - but thats because he wants to play Aaron Copland, and even if this trumpet was easy to operate, it wouldn't allow him to do that! Overall, this toy is a good idea that should be better executed."
3,Great for younger kids!,I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old nephew as a birthday gift. He really enjoys it. It is a good gift but I wish that it was more durable.
2,Does not teach real music,"My 3 year old could play my husbands trumpet using the proper lip technique, but it was too heavy. So, we bought him this one. It's nice and light, but not at all like a real instrument. All you do is blow and you have to have a key pressed to make a note, so you are limited to 4 notes. Very disappointing and not educational."
3,Trumpet,"This product is priced good for the quality. If you have a child that is rough with toys, this is not a good chose. My daughter is[...] and she really enjoys this toy."
1,plastic trumpet,"well, that was a dissapointment. didnt even work properly from day one. Believe me you get what you pay for.....it was cheap, and so was the product...."
1,Piece of Junk!,"The Trumpet is very poorly made and does not work at all. A total waste of money and a ""ripoff."""
5,Great Trumpet,We bought this item for my son's 4th birthday and he absolutely loves it. It is a great first instrument for our budding musician.
2,trumpet - just OK,received for christmas for my 2 1/2 year old. She likes to carry it around and blow on it. She is used to buzzing her lips like playing on a real horn and this toy trumpet only proudces sound when you blow without buzzing and while a button (valve) is pushed. Its OK for the look of a trmpet and she can make a couple of notes but not good for much else. Only produces three four tones with each of the buttons.made from plactic that doesn't appear too durable.
4,Silver Trumpet,My son wanted a trumpet so I ordered this one for him. It's very durable and he likes it however he has a hard time playing. Overall this is a good insturment I would order from this company again.
2,Awkward button location,"In order to set the alarm, you have to remove the battery cover. Inevitably you will wind up jarring the battery and reset everything, which is very frustrating. The time set and alarm set buttons should have been in a different spot."
2,Poorly designed buttons--cant tell if alarm is on,"Ditto what others have said about the button design. You have to remove the battery cover on the back to set the alarm. WORSE, you have no way of telling what time the alarm clock is set for without taking the battary cover off, and then switching the mode to ""set alarm time"" to then have it display on the clock. Who the heck designed this thing?! Obviously someone who doesnt travel! I do love the thermometer on the front tho. I would never buy this product (got it as a gift)."
2,Thank you for the earlier negative reviews....,"I was on the verge of buying this in a Brookstone store; I saw 2 issues with this. It felt very cheap, and the backlight was barely visible; I could see my watch better in the same light. Most Brookstone products I have are well made; but, these were the products purchased 10 years ago."
2,"Interesting idea, oddly exeuted","This book falls into a trap of academic writing that some people will find a bit objectionable. There is so much structure that you are bombarded with a series of statements that effectively are saying: This is what I'm going to tell you fact 1 in a moment, now I'm about to tell you fact 1, are you ready for fact 1, oh wait I are you sure you're ready for fact 1, now lets all be shocked by me telling you fact 1, and finally lets dwell on fact 1. This is ok for some forms of academic writing, but to the casual reader it is a bit infuriating to be assumed so dull witted that you do not understand the words in front of you. The writing is clear, usually precise, but rarely concise. The topic is strictly a matter of economics, and the relation to other fields of philosophy and science is not particularly well developed despite there being ample evidence available for such diversions."
3,Quadgear ATV Fender cargo bag,"It's ok for what it is. There is ok room, and it looks like it will last a while. The bottom has a bungee cord to secure the bottom of the bag to the floorboard. Not sure how well that will hold up. If you use this in conjunction with a fender bag on the rear fender, you will have just enough room to put your foot on the floorboard. I was ok with it enough to buy a second one."
5,Amazing,"Okay, first of all, this is a magazine, not a clip. A clip goes inside a gun, and a magazine is on the outside of a gun, and you can you reload is while the bbs are in or outside of the gun.Anyway, this is an awesome MAGAZINE. If you are going to get an AK 47, get this, you won't be let down. You need a backup magazine in an airsoft war, so get this one. The only thing you have to do that is sort of annoying is twist the bottom, but oh well. All in all, I give it 5 stars"
5,"Cogent, thought-provoking and brilliant",Rarely has an author captured both the folly and innate genuis of the human species so perfectly as has Lewis Thomas in this beautifully written book. Highly recommended.
2,"Brilliant title, content not.","I was not as enthralled as the other reviewers.The main articles in this book dealt with music and thermonuclear weapons.The author is, with reason, a fervent opponent of nuclear weapons; who not? But he must admit that in the field of basic science there have never been cutbacks in the financing of research on thermonuclear weapons!On the other hand, I agree that it is not easy to write about music. But these texts are not at the same level as, for instance, the brilliant 'Penguin Guide to Compact Discs'. I am also a big fan of Mahler. That's why I bought this book and read it.I should however quote an important remark by the author : twentieth century science has provided us with a glimpse of something we never really knew before, the revelation of human ignorance."
5,UNIqUE & AMAZING,I am very picky about what I listen to. I like unknown artists who you don't hear on the radio everyday. It was refreshing to listen to this CD. Julia's voice is so unique and amazing. I never get tired of listening to it. And you can tell the she writes the songs with the listners in mind. It's a wonderful CD that is well worth the buy.
2,holes are too small,"The display rack is cute and arrives as pictured but it too is not meant for cake pops, which is my error. The seller refused to accept the return. What is up with that? So much for customer satisfaction! Learned my lesson. The seller refused a return, so, again I simply tossed the money in the trash."
4,Measure First,"It is what it says it is, but it's really small...just make sure you look at the dimensions first...looks cute loaded with cake pops, though~~~~~~~"
4,Very cute,"This stand is a very cute display item- it's only limitations are that it does not fit cookie pop sticks, or long sticks. But it looks great."
3,Cake Pops? Help,"I am looking for a holder like this to display cake pops. I wanted to read all of the reviews before I bought it to see if anyone had used it for cake pops yet. I read three comments about this holder being used for cake pops,one comment said the cake pops could not be removed without problems and another just said it looks cute loaded with cake pops. A third comment was just to say that they had purchased the holder to be used for cake pops and that the holders were great but they had not actually used it yet. If anyone out there reads my review and has actually used this for cake pops, please give your comments on how well it worked. I will come back a few more times before I purchase this."
3,just okay,for the price you pay i think its just okay. the color isn't shiny. the color is a littlebit dull.
3,lcd display is a problem,"I sent this item to my parents who are elderly. They have difficulty reading the LCD display. It doesn't light up in darkness, so unless you're using this in daylight, you can't see the display."
3,OK... but the last illustration is a little creepy.,"I like Teddy Roosevelt, especially the San Juan Hill Teddy Roosevelt.This book takes you through Teddy's asthmatic childhood, his brilliance at school, his ranching days in early adulthood, his leadership in the military, and then his presidency.It focuses WAY too much time on his interactions with his children while he was president -- who cares? The book mentions his progressive causes but does not elaborate.This book is not going to make your child fall in love with or admire Teddy Roosevelt. It may not even interest your child at all. And the last page's illustrated portrait of him is pretty creepy -- those teeth."
4,Ok for the Most Part,"The story about Teddy Roosevelt is pretty interesting. I scratched my head at learning that the United States entered the Spanish-American War because the US was afraid of Spain invading them. What??????? I would sentence this writer, her editor and the publishing company back to History 101 for remediation!"
1,dvd's music,"please make it standard to supply customers with:1. langauge/audio formats (5.1, ac3, dts etc.)2. title tracks/hit list in the full.3. aspect ratio (screen size projection)you may have many reviews from customers (mainly subjective) - but without the above said data one is lost in gathering what quality you are purchasing.thank you.andre"
3,All Jazz,"I was disappointed in Eddie Palmieri's new CD. I am a fan of his Ritmo Caliente CD. I listen to salsas and chachas alot. But this CD has only one chacha and is strictly jazz. I wouldn't even classify the CD in the Latin Jazz catagory. While it is good music for sure, it wasn't exactly what I have heard from him before and not what I was looking for."
4,Red Skelton- Vol. 3 Holiday Collection,"Red Skelton Vol. 3 is a collection of his tv shows andmay be considered ""funky"" by our modern society; but hishumor is still valid and Red was funny without being obscene.Sure beats today's comedians. They could learn a lot from Red."
3,Vey good for the money but missing some important things,"You certainly get good value on this receiver. The sound quality was average. It has plenty of features found on more expensive items. The biggest problem is that it does not support 1080p over HDMI, only up to 1080i. So if you don't mind not having that feature it a great buy, otherwise you will have to get a different receiver"
3,Not even sure if they are actually Diablo Heat paintballs,"Paint balls came in a plastic bag with no label? Listing shows picture of box - these do not come in a box and there is no way to identify if these are actually the brand your purchasing. Could very well be, but who knows."
1,Not paint I ordered,"The Paint I ordered was saposed to be Diablo Heat, Instead I got shipped Basic Field Paint. I do not recommend buying paintballs from any site's like this. I wont return do to the fact Im impatient."
2,Started good but ended bad,"I had this card for more than 6 months, and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510. Transfers went well too. Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting ""card error"" on my computer and digital camera a week ago. My SD/USB converter couldn't find the card either. I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good. What a joke."
4,I liked the first episode the best,"I hope the Product information has been changed. I write this as of 10/10/06. If it still says GUEST STAR Errol Flynn, THAT""S WRONG!!! That having been said, this group of episodes from The Red Skelton Show is a delightful collection. The picture quality is as best as could be remastered from 1950's TV master print. This quality is better than a copy of ""What's my Line?"" that I recently purchased. The 1st episode has a young Jamie Farr playing straight man to Skelton's inept sailor character, and Buster Crabbe as their Cheif Petty Officer. Any current or former Navy man or woman will get a kick out of Crabbe's reading from the drill manual. The other two episodes have Mickey Rooney as a defense attorney defending.... you guessed it- Freddie the Freeloader, and Jane Powell (who flubbs a line) as a princess."
2,Where are the sleeves?!,"The case says it holds 400, but only 50 hanging sleeves are provided. A card comes with it saying you can go online to order the rest you just have to pay shipping and handling, but when you get to checkout, the site is not secure because it has a bad certificate! Beware of their website."
4,Good for disk storage,"I bought this to store the massive collection of disk i had witch included software, music, cds, games, ect. It holds them well and even fit some odd shaped cd boxes (apple's, iLife box, and tiger 10.4 box) Seems sturdy enough if its for storage and lite to moderate travel."
1,"Cheap, Shoddy","I don't even think it's real aluminum foil. You have to pay extra for something that should have come in the box.(an extra 7.00 to 27.00 for the hanging files) If you choose the $7 shipping expect to wait 6 to 8 weeks for delivery. This means ""Should you decide that you don't like it it will be too late to return it to Amazon"". If you decide not to use the hanging files, it's not designed for that. There are no rows. As far as security is concerned, you don't even need a paper clip to jimmy the lock. I'm not concerned with your money. Save yourself the trouble of sending it back by not buying it."
4,It's fine for my purposes,"I like it fine, except they should put a handle on the top of it so you don't have to grab the handles on both ends to carry it. Otherwise its pefectly ok to me."
5,Still Kickin Ass,"Basically, if your a fan of the Norwegian Rock bands such as The Hellacopters, & Backyard Babies then your probably a fan of Gluecifer. This is a great album. It's pure Rock & Roll and doesn't slow down for a second. If you love pure Rock then pick this album up. And if you don't like this album then someone should explain to you what Pure Rock & Roll is."
1,What Was He Thinking?,"First of all, I'm not hounding Clay Crosse. I'm criticizing whatever amateur did the recording, mixing, and editing of this entire project. Well...I wasn't at all taken by this CD. It's not even a little good. No wonder it is out-of-print now. The arrangements are sparse and uninventive. The vocals by Clay are just aweful. I mean, it seriously sounds as if he went into the studio after just waking up one morning and did one take of his vocal. I can't tell you how many times he sounds uninterested himself...even flat at times. For a ""professional"" vocalist to do this is unexcusable. I get the impression that this was an independent recording and not one released by his former record label. Time and money was probably a huge factor in the making of this CD. Too bad it didn't turn out to be good."
2,BLUE CHRISTMAS,"I haven't figured out why so many artists (particularly contemporary Christian ones) want to do Christmas songs as relics from the big band era. Not that I have anything against that wonderful period of music, trying to breathe life into traditional carols by ""big banding"" them has gotten tired. First, Russ Taff, Kathy Troccoli, and now Clay Crosse. It's not that they are bad, but if you already have a good collection of holiday cd's, this one offers nothing new. Crosse's voice is so obviously effected, he loses the heart and the spirit of these songs. Nice try, Clay, but listen to Steven Curtis to understand how to really make a good Christmas album."
1,Images of lounge singers dancing in my head,"If you like bad Vegas-style Christmas music, then this CD is for you. When I listened to the first track, I got an image of a lounge singer in a leisure suit snapping his fingers along with the tune. To give the artist his due, this is probably not the type of music he normally sings and he may be quite good in his normal genre. The real culprit here is the producer who thought these were good arrangements and that they fit the artist's voice. The album was $2.97 at my local bookstore and I can see why."
3,A little too snug...,"Its nice that you don't have to worry about them sliding off, but if you have to wear them for prolonged periods of time they tend to make the veins in your forearms a little sore as if the blood flow is being restricted..."
3,If you like a firm cup....,If you like a firm molded cup you will like this bra. Seems to be well made and the embroidery is pretty. Personally I find it a bit too stiff for comfort.
1,Supplier did not respond to problem w/order,"I ordered and paid for two items from this supplier. After the shipment failed to arrive, I emailed and left a voice message with RockinSox. Neither was answered. This is both bad for the RockinSox and Amazon."
3,satisfied.,"It's a nice bra, supportive, though the shape of the cups is a little odd to me. over all, I'm satisfied but not thrilled."
3,VERY loud vibration,"This item is working to help me space some important medicine, but only two of the capsules fit into each chamber. I don't bother loading it anymore, just use it as a timer. The vibration is very loud. Also, to stop the vibration, you have to turn the dial, and it beeps when you do. Defeats the purpose of vibrate for silent reminders. I bought it to have a reminder without being obvious."
3,"Alarm Pill Box: Inexpensive and effective, but small","This is a nice, compact, little pill box. Economical. Easy to read display. I like it. Two short-comings:1. Instructions are printed in EXTREMELY SMALL TYPE. If you don't have excellent reading glasses or an electron microscope, find someone who does before you take this out of the package.2. If you take many, many pills or your pills are large, this little unit may not accomodate them. The compartments are very small."
4,Nice,"I have to take one of my medications every eight hours. Was OK for the morning and night pills but was forgetting the mid-day one. Bought this unit and have not missed a dose since. Times are easy to set -- once a day to five times a day. My hearing is not too good but I can hear this beep and/or vibrate quite well. Is small enough to carry in your pocket.There is a handy pulse monitor included on the pill box that works very well.Only problem was, the lithium battery supplied with the unit was no good when received. Bought one at WalMart for under $2 and all was fine. You will need four AAA batteries that are not supplied."
3,Worked great...could be better built.,"Got this alarm to help my wife to keep track of her eye medication which needed to be taken four times daily. Once you set the alarm times, the vibrating beeper worked very well to help maintain the daily schedule.The only negative comment is that the blue led night light stopped working after second day."
3,5 Alarm Pill Box,The first one I received did not work. I called and the customer service rep was very helpful but the paperwork to return it was very slow in coming and the return took a long time. The second box worked just fine. It is a bit hard to figure out how to use it. The instructions are not clear but over time it should become easier to set and use.
1,Touchy Pill Reminder!,"I got this pill reminder as a Christmas gift - it was great the first week using all of the five alarms without using the pill compartments.Sadly, I dropped the reminder from couch table to floor rug where I snooze. The LCD screen blanked out and then came on. At that time the alarms/clock seemed to work fine. Only by the next day, the inside included CR2025 battery apparently died (checked with a VOM). I bought one through Amazon and also added a new Duracell AAA battery. Yes, this TAKES TWO TYPE DIFFERENT BATTERIES! Yet LCD screen did NOT light up even after RESET. :(Using Amazon I bought myself my Xmas gift ($35) MedCenter pill reminder which has VOICE ALARMS to Boot! NOW I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. The MedCenter IS SUPER STURDY & LOUDER! (adjustable). The meds which are too many and some are LARGE to put in the small touchy pill reminder, I now take them with peace of mind and ON TIME!"
1,Poor Service/ no working product yet!,Ordered item 2/18. Received 2/23. Product defective. Called to get return authorization. Had to pay $4.05 for returned shipping on 2/24. Called on 3/21 to see if return received. Product was received and they said they will credit my account in 7-10 days although I told them to send me a replacement pill box. They agreed to ship another pill box to me. Today is 3/21. I have yet to receive the product nor the credit for the shipping I had to pay to return a defective product. Is one month and three days an excessive wait for a product?? I have not found dealing with Maxi Aids to be a good experience.
5,Great Pill Timer!,This is a really useful product and very intuitive to use. Seems they've thought of everything one could need in a pill timer!
2,"A little bulky, not ideal for a purse","I was looking for a reminder that would fit in my purse and would be easily concealable while not taking up much space. Unfortunately, it was a little bulky, much rounder than flat, as I had anticipated.The beeping was definitely audible from across the house, high-pitched and loud, and the vibrations were serious too. Figuring out the second battery and how to set the alarms was confusing at first, but easy once I got the hang of it. For the pills that I would have it hold, there was plenty of room (my pills are about 1/4"" by 1/4""), but again, not exactly what I was looking for. I returned it, so I don't know what it was like to use it on a daily basis."
2,maybe the second will be better,the first one arrived malfunctioning...returned for replacement. Customer service was fair. Still waiting for the replacement after two weeks.
2,I'm just not that into her,"I really expected to enjoy a quick read. It turned out that Beth Lisick is not that funny or interesting or insightful. Some chapters were okay, others left me completely cold."
3,Offbeat slice of life stories,Very enjoyable short stories with a unique view of growing up and living in northern California.
3,We don't swim in your toilet so please don't pee in our pool,"I enjoyed parts of this book and found it, as promoted, funny, quirky and often a page out of my 1960's childhood in the bay area. Beth's (were now on a first name basis due to knowing so much about her sex life) style was clever and sometimes unique, however, she did not hit the nerve the way Sedaris does...but who else really does? The book got a little tedious after the first few chapters and the stories got a little anemic. I would bet that her best work is yet to come. I gave this book away as a present before reading it and found that I had ""some splaining to do""."
5,SO FUNNY!,After reading a chapter of this book in the Metro I knew I had to check it out. There are stories in here that are laugh out loud funny. I work at a book store in the bay area and have recommended it to many. DONT PASS THIS ONE UP!
5,I CAN'T WAIT FOR BETH'S NEXT MEMIOR!!,"Beth Lisick's tales are so entertaining and funny! She is a great writer and has wonderful material to work with in Everybody into the Pool. These are terrific little stories about her childhood, her life in the arts around San Francisco and being a new mom.If you enjoy reading Augusten Burroughs and David Sedaris memiors you will absolutely enjoy this book! A very fast and fun read."
2,Not for me,"This book goes solidly into the ""not for me"" pile. I didn't find Lisick's alternative lifestyle interesting, or humorous, or in the least bit respectable or necessary. I'm sure it would appeal to some, hence the two stars instead of just one, but in my case, I'm just glad it's off of my to-be-read shelf."
5,"Sincero, different but delightful","When the buzz started about the content of this cd I was a little anxious. Rock, Hip hop, Rap ??? Not the Chayanne I am use to, but as I've learned with other artists every cd can't be an out of the park homerun. So I prepared myself for a cd I would like, but not love. I was wrong, I admit it, I LOVE this cd. Chayanne went in a new direction and the resulting production is absolutely awesome. Naturally there are his signature romantic ballads which transport you to the romantic corners of your mind, but there are also some harder edged, rock tinge, electric guitar highlighting songs that blew me away. If you're a fan buy it you won't be disappointed. If he's someone you haven't experienced before, buy it and you'll be a fan from now on."
5,Bestial!!!,"En este disco hay temas preciosos, en especial me gusta'Caprichosa' porque se lo canto a mi esposa y bailamos.Nos trae buenos recuerdos del verano en la playa, tomando nuestro pisquito con un cevichito.Hechamos de menos que vuelva a sonar ésta canción en todas las playas."
2,Sinceramente Porqueria,"Este disco no me dice nada. Con la exception de los temas ""Sentada Aqui En Mi Alma,"" ""Un Siglo Sin Ti,"" ""Cuidarte El Alma,"" y unos mas es un disco incompleto. Tiene muchas canciones sin sentido y muy ""pop."" Chayanne tiene que evolucionar como artista y salir de sus dias con Menudo."
1,le falta salir de lo mismo,"en realidad, aunque soy puerto riqueña y aprecio lo que los aritstas de aqui hacen, no puedo decir lo mismo de chayanne ya que apesar de los años se basa en lo mismo, no crea sus canciones que se supone que a estas alturas no lo hace y lo dice, ademas de que basta con oir al pan pan vino vino y me suena infantil, caprichosa ni hablar esta out, fuera de moda, chayanne bajo mi opinion se ha quedado en los tiempos de fiesta en america, y no, el debe evolucionar, y no es por comparar pero soy aficionada a la musica y he oido el disco de ricky martin y me parece que cada vez que hace algo es inovador y refrescante pero chayanne en lo mismo con sus ritmos sin nada electronico que le hace falta, en fin a evolucionar chayanne hay muchos discos que han salido que para ser sincera le han dado pela"
2,Pass this one unless you like cheezy films,"I don't know if I should call this .. [an inexpensive], low-budget road flick with numerous ... scenes that don't even fit into the plot. Whatever the case, this movie has no significant story and the scenes are very [physical] although not truly [explicit]. ..."
5,One of the Best Gay Soft-Core Movies made today,"This movies is a typical road movie, but with twists and stops along the way that adds color and sexual pleasure with beautiful cinematography. The 'Pool' scene alone is so beautiful and exotic, and it makes me proud that an honest, erotic homosexual movies can be produced with beauty, honesty and integrety. Gay men and Lesbians are shown with all emotions here, and little if any real hollywood sterotyping."
1,OK Nails but NOT as Advertised!!,"Based on appearance these look like they're Grip-Rite nails BUT1. They came in a beat-up generic box - not the ""manufacturer's original packaging"".2. There were absolutely no identifying markings on or inside the box. Taped to the outside of the box was a fragment of a box flap from some other box of nails but it didn't have any part numbers or even the manufacturer name on it.3. The nails were just thrown into a bag and dropped in the box.4. Several strips were damaged or brokenFor the price ($33.79 delivered) it isn't worth the trouble to wrestle a 55lb return. The undamaged strips work OK so I'll let it slide.Amazon -- get a handle on your warehouse operations!!!!"
1,should have been labeled salvage,"[[ASIN:B0009XTSZ6 Grip-Rite GR024 Round Head 3-1/4-Inch by .131-Inch by 21 Nail (4,000 per Box)] I ordered a box of these nails June '08 at the to good to be true price of $33.79 ,delivered figuring it was too good to be true as hand drive nails are up to that price. I figured to buy a box and if all's well stock up. The nails arrived in good time but the box was not original, way too big and it appeared the nails were just dumped inside. About 40% of the strips were complete and the rest broken or deformed with a few pounds good only to hand drive. By the time the order arrived the price is up to about $55 which wouldn't be bad if they would all be gun ready. Given the truly incredible condition of the nails in the first order I won't chance it again. The first order couldn't even be considered packed irresponsibly, it was dumped into the first box handy like someone taking out the trash. My first bad luck with amazon."
5,Brilliant,"The variety, the lyrics, the raw power of something more than you are used to. Beneath these fireworks is one of my top 5 favorites I've ever owned. From the upbeat, ""Sad Songs"" which deals obviously with always feeling bad for himself, to lyrics such as ""It's amazing, the look in your eyes, like you could save me...but you don't even try."" Also with twists such as little victories which has opened my mind to become more optimistic. This album has changed my life. It is beautiful and I must recommend it with the highest regard."
3,Great Sound... a little disappointed,"I love the voice, the lyrics, the acoustic guitar... But I hate that mainstream sound. I don't care for the hyper-basic drum beats and I don't like cheesy sounding electric riffs. I'm giving Matt a break though. He's an excellent songwriter and has got a very unique style of writing. 'Angel' is more of what I'm used to when it comes to Matt and that, I guess, is what I expected. I won't trash the album because it's definately not trash, just not his best. Worth checking out."
5,Matt Nathanson is Great,"Matt Nathanson is a great change to anything. His songs are catchy, easy to learn, and truly incredible. This funny guy is a great performer and this CD definitely shows his best songs."
4,"awesome music, short cd","pros: awesome music and vocals, plain and simple. there is a soft harmony to this album. the cd ranges between tracks that are soft acoustic music with strong vocals and strong music with even stronger vocals. in each song, the strength and style of the music matches the voice of matt nathanson, which is clear, strong, and well-spoken. wonderful lyrics.cons: the cd length is 40 minutes and 14 seconds, which is a bit short for the price and THE ONLY reason this cd loses a star.if you've got the money for the cd and don't mind that it is a little short, i would strongly recommend it. i purchased this album on my friend's recommendation, and i definitely am happy i listened to her."
3,Mixed bag,"This CD has a number of great pop tracks, but I find some of his slower stuff less inspiring and routinely skip them for the 4 or so tracks I actually dig on. Not as solid an effort as I was expecting, but the tracks that are good are VERY good."
5,awesome talent,"Great album! Matt has a great voice and i would recommend this album to others that like artist's such as howie day, gavin degraw and josh kelley. Really worth the money! Favourites include 'sad song', 'Bent' and 'Pretty the world"" however they are all great songs and i never find myself skipping to the next song like you do with other cds! His music doesn't get radio play in New Zealand but it totally should! Go Matt!"
5,Great CD,"Beneath the Fireworks is a collection of music that really grows on you, and it is one that you can listen to over and over. There are no 'bad songs' on this cd. The lyrics are great, and it almost seems like prose -- but not too sing-songy. I would compare this to Counting Crow's Hard Candy album but with no guitar and a softer tone. I definitley recommend it."
1,Camera stopped working after 1 day: save your time and money,"A Nikon 3 megapixel camera for $129? Too good to be true? You bet. The camera worked fine for a day, but then started to turning off intermittently. It refused to take photos and would not play back images. It also eats through batteries. I'm currently returning it via Amazon's excellent 30 day return policy."
1,Mediocre,"A bad ""tribute"" to a great band that deserves better. mediocre bands (with the exception of Weezer) trying to pull off some of the best songs in the Green Day catalog. Wester's cover of ""J.A.R."" is downright embarrassing. What's worse is that the song ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"" (one of their most known songs) is not present, nor any of Insomniac songs,(an album not very popular but is very good and simple). Seriously why didn't they cover ""Brain Stew/Jaded"" or ""Walking Contradiction""? it is an unexceptional tribute to one of the best punk bands of the 90s."
2,A Shade of Brown-Green,"This one really disappointed me. I brought this album because I am a huge Green Day fan, and I was interested in how other bands, including Weezer, imitated them. All I can say is that no one can cover these songs even half as well as the original. Weezer's version of Worry Rock was frightening, and the other bands were mediocre, at best. All in all, a total waste of money. No one can sing like Billie Joe."
1,omg.............,"Okay, I don't even own this album, from playing the PREVIEWS, I don't want it. All of these covers are horrible. I am an almost die-hard Green Day fan and I must say all of these covers suck. I won't buy this, I will never buy this and I hope next time someone tries to cover and awesome band thats been together for almost 16 years, make it sound at least 100x better."
2,misleading photo,"actually i have not yet used this product. my issue is that the plug in cord that comes with the device is about 6 inches long, not nearly as long as the one pictured in amazon. the product is not useable without buying an outdoor ""w-a"" extension cord. it's misleading advertising."
1,Iomega Firewire CD Burner,"We were very disappointed with this product! This CD burner isn't compatable with OS 9.2, which came out over a year ago. We actually had to downgrade our computer to try to use it! Afterwards, the burner still didn't work, and now our computer is buggy. This burner is also incompatable with iTunes. This product may work on a PC, but we wouldn't recommend it for a Mac. We're sending this burner back for a refund."
4,Does too work great with Macs!,"Contrary to what another reviewer has said, this works fine with Mac OSX. The sotware that comes with the burner is for OS9 only, but, everything needed to use this drive is built in to OSX already. If you're running OS9, then just install the provided software, If you're running OSX, then just plug it in and go. To write data, just drag stuff to it in the finder, and then use the 'burn' menu item when you're ready. Use iTunes to make music CD's (standard, or MP3). To erase a CD-RW, use the Disk Utility application in the Applications/Utilities folder.I give it 4 stars. Deducting 1 star for the noise level (only when burning), and the fact that the documentation doesn't tell you, and no one at Iomega knew, that you need to use Disk Utility to erase. If you're reading this, then that problem is solved."
5,Awesome,"This is the first Starlight Mints album I've heard. I have to admit that the first time I listened it was difficult. The songs sound good but nothing special. But every time I finish the track 11, something motivated me to start again. Now, after 5 days I think it's an AWESOME album, every song is a new adventure. My favorites ones are the dark Goldstar, the quiet Zillion Eyes and the catchy Brass Digger."
2,"Disappointing, but it'll have to do.","On the first listen, my anticipation for this album hardly seemed appropriate by the middle of the fourth track. By the end of the disc, nothing but disappointment. I have given it countless listens since then and I honestly only like three of the songs. On ""Built On Squares"", the Mints completely abandon the baroque-pop sound that worked so well on the near-perfect ""Dream That Stuff Was Made Of"". To me, this album sounds like a completely different band, going for a sound that has been done, done again and worn out by so many others (I know it's a stretch, but think Thrill Kill Kult's ""Hit and Run Holiday""). I gave ""Squares"" two stars because the Mints at their not-so-best are still better than a lot of other bands' best."
2,"More about Backstage myths, than music","I bought this DVD thinking it would have stories, video footage, or live musical performances... I was wrong. The bands on ""here"" are: Papa Roach, eve6, Crowbar, Genetorters, and Dope. It has a few funny stories, a live song from Dope (I'm not a fan), a video from Pimpadelic (not a fan) but little else. This was put out for a quick buck by Inzane Records. Crowbar is in the DVD for no more than 20 seconds, Zebrahead is in for a minute, but unless you like stories/ goofing around by Papa Roach, Genetorters, and Dope this DVD is not very good. It is good for a quick laugh, but not something you'd watch more than once."
4,Van-Damme,Well the movie NoWhere To Run is an awsome movie but hear you also get the movie Knockoff which is a really good action packed movie I definently recomend this Double Feature.
5,Saves the Pain,"I tried this originally with some borrowed from my father to help with a bit of tendinitis in my mouse clicker (index) finger. This stuff seemed to help substantially and I've tried other Glucosamine Chondroitin that was really cheap and completely ineffective. The cheap stuff didn't seem to help at all. The tablets seem to not digest well or something compared to the capsules. Regardless, I'm a fan now, and buy a few of these a year!"
1,Doesn't work!,"While I have no problem with other DVDs, this one doesn't work on my laptop. My operating system is Win7."
1,TOTAL RIP OFF,"There is no actual routines included in any of the 3 DVD's I received! - The ""Pilates Complete for weight loss"" does not have sound - you just hear the music. This purchase was a TOTAL RIP OFF! and you need a printer to return the item if not you are SOL!. . . My advice to any one thinking about purchasing this DVD is . . . . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!. . . It would be worth the money to purchase directly from Mari Winsor's web site, because Amazons return policy SUCK!"
1,"Amazon, Stop Selling This Terrible DVD!","I'm sorry my review cannot be more detailed. The only reason I am writing a review is in the hopes that another person doesn't get ripped off by any of the people who make money off of this DVD, including Amazon. I don't know anything about Pilates, but I think I could do a better job than the ""teacher"" on this DVD. Boring, vague, unhelpful instruction. I don't even want to sell this at the next garage sale because I don't want anyone else to waste their money. It will most likely end up in the garbage."
3,The covers are misleading. They were made in the 80s to 90s . But some of it is good.,"Planned on returning look at the first one because it was made in the 80s and the woman is pretty dull and boring and annoying. Would be good for people with injuries or need a very slow pace to learn and do. The weight-loss one is actually pretty good. Seems to be more in the 90s and the woman is better and you can actually work out more at a better pace. The tone one is good too made more in the 90s as well she actually is talking and doing the exercises at the same time so more like being at a class. Warning for it though there some mat workouts you can do but others require equipment like weights, ring, large ball, and weighted ball. Overall ok for the money."
2,Bamboozled!,"First of all, the producers of this DVD trick you into believing that the attractive women on the DVDs will be leading the instruction. Wrong! Instead you get an ageing, stiff woman who is obviously uncomfortable giving instruction and doing the exercises at the same time. In fact she doesn't. She narrates the lessons as she does them off pace of the narration. The exercises themselves are too simple to have any real effect on your physique or stamina. It would have have also helped if Ms. Rhoades would have told viewers the items needed BEFORE starting the exercises instead of during them. I had to pause the lesson and go look for pillows and belts during the routines. Overall, I am very disappointed in the false advertising and geriatric pace of these DVDs. I wish Rhoades would have had the guts to put her own picture on her DVDs and gave better instruction."
1,The DVDs are not the appropriate zone for my area,"I live in Australia, the DVDs arrived in a timely mannder. However, the DVDs are not the appropriate zone for my area and I cannot play them. I will need to upgrade my dvd player in order to use them. Needless to say, I am not satisfied."
5,a great investment,I found the dvd collection a great investment! It is a definite workout ( at least for me) and I love that you get 3 differant dvd options in one package. I love the feature of being able to chose a workout under 15 minutes or more than 15 minutes and which equipement I want to use. Would def. recommend!
5,All the Pilates you need to get started,"If you have been interested in trying Pilate but haven't been able to decide on one DVD, consider this box set. Each of the 3 DVDs is completely different and all are good. One is for people who have little flexibility. It will get you up to the point of being able to take advantage of what Pilates has to offer. The weight loss DVD is really for anyone and so is the sculpt & tone. Both of these have a lot of workouts to choose from both different lengths and degrees of difficulty. There is something on each DVD that you can do and benefit from no matter what your fitness level, flexibility or experience with Pilates."
5,Great Introduction to Pilates,This DVD is informative and easy to follow. I really enjoy the no-frills instruction. It's exactly what I was looking for as a pilates beginner. I use it often and am finding it to be very helpful as an accompaniment to the yoga exercises I already do.
5,Just wanted I wanted.,"I just do not have the time to run out to the gym for a Pilates class and I don't like fighting rain, snow and wind to get there. I purchased this box set and it gives me just wanted I need when it is to my convenience. The workouts are fantastic and offer different levels depending on my needs or for just variety. Easy to follow, I feel great."
3,too slow,"I wanted something easy since I have a hurt hip, but this was way too slow and if you have time for 30 min on each section then it is ok. I personally did not find it useful."
3,good for beginners!!,"I have done pilates in the past but got bored with the dvd I had I wanted a more of a challenge. I did the Inflexible dvd for a bit since I was being reintroduced to Pilates all over again for about a week. I moved on to The Sculpt and Tone. I think this dvd is the golden ticket. You can do a variations of pilates moves with just a mat, weights, or the ring. I want to move up to using a ring soon but for now I only have weights.Very good to tone up. I have seen a differnce in my belly and thighs. I enjoy this set."
5,Fanastic introduction to Pilates,"I didn't know anything about Pilates when I purchased this set. I was looking to increase core and arm strength, since all I do is run. I've been using this set for 2 months, and just love it. The Sculpt and Tone is my favorite DVD. I get a good workout, and feel relaxed and invigorated afterward. It's great for both body and mind. I can feel the increased strength and toning in my core and arms already, and my flexibility has improved. Many of my aches and pains have gone away. If I do a workout as soon as I come home from work, my stress and anxiety levels go down, which decreases my desire to inhale the contents of my refrigerator. Who knew I was getting exercise, diet and therapy all at once! What a deal!"
3,"Comprehensive moves, poor low quality production",The moves are pretty basic pilates and are great for beginners but the production quality was just so disappointing. Very amateur. You're better off watching pilates online from YouTube videos
5,Great Collection Of Pilates DVDs,"The three DVDs and the different instructors all bring a different part of learning pilates together in this set.There is something for beginners, which includes a very basic level with alot of modifications and a more stepped up level which is still geared for beginners, in the first title which works real well to learn. The second title with a different instructor has a good section for starting out also then has two more levels while the last video is for when you have learned some and really works you out.A comprehensive set that will cover everything you need."
4,Good DVD's,Some of these DVD's are good for beginners but some of them are still fairly difficult. I am in my 30's and fairly flexible and thin and still had trouble with some of them.
5,The Great Evangelical Disaster,Excellent condition.The book is timeless. This book still speaks to us todayHe is right on even prophetic.
1,Virtually Incomprehensible Dreck,"Forget looking up...just DON'T!Another American J-Horror remake of...something...that is virtually incomprehensible.A film crew doing a remake of a ""doomed"" silent film are attacked by evil spirits and lots and lots of terrible CGI flies. Despite the advertising, Eli Roth is in the film for less than five minutes before the opening credits.Instead, we gets lots of shots of the attractive yet wooden and thoroughly unlikable leading man standing open-mouthed amid swarms of aforementioned terrible CGI flies, causing me to recall the scoldings of Sister Ruth Ann in second grade shouting, ""Close your mouth, before you start catching flies!!""Patrick - ScreamQueenz Horror Blog"
2,FLIES IN MY EYES,"Another remake of a Japanese horror film featuring SURPRISE an evil female spirit!While director Fruit Chan creates an eerie atmosphere, the script is so disjointed, the movie ultimately collapses on itself.ET's Henry Thomas seems lost in his role and Reshad Shirk (sp) is a weak lead.Its muddled and tedious, a misfired reimaging."
2,Fly on the Wall,"DON'T LOOK UP tried. It really did. Sadly, the movie is so disjointed that it almost makes no sense. I watch films very carefully and this one, while not a true stinker, tap dances very close to the edge of being a ""bad"" movie. The acting is good and bad in places. The issues with the film are many. It moves slowly which is fine when it is engaging. The film fails to engage. The plot is neither creepy nor scary. It comes off almost feeling like a spoof until you realize that it is trying to be serious. The movie falls squarely into the middle of the mediocre classification. It is not something, which I would own or really even want to watch again. The film simply tries and fails."
1,Just Don't Look At All.,"Gypsy bla bla who cares, this is just a sad movie from dumb start to even more ignorant ending. This movie ticked me off with it's ultra lame gypsy devil curse and sad pitiful effects. Why oh why did I spend this much time on this inadequate piece of garbage ? Please I beg of you do not waist your time on this movie you would be better of watching one of those Life Time flicks you have seen time and time again, well maybe not that but is there a Myth Busters on you have seen fewer then 4 times ? Stay away at all cost."
1,DON'T LOOK UP [DVD],"Wow - After reading all the reviews, I am wondering if they saw the same film I viewed. Simply put, this movie should have been entitled, ""Don't Throw Up,"" due to all the bad acting, story line, special effects, etc. If there were a lower rating than one star, I would have rated that for this film. Now I understand why there were so many flies used in this movie - it's because it smelled like fresh dog crap. I am positive that this film is the worst I have seen in decades. I cannot believe Eli Roth, Henry Thomas and Reshad Strik would lend their names to this waste of celluloid. Now thank me for sparing you 98 minutes of excruciating torture..."
2,Mine Not Fully Functional,"At first glance this looks like a nicely built (small and simple) desk calculator, which is exactly what I wanted. And it does work fine for basic adding and subtracting, which is primarily all I need it for. But I soon noticed that when you multiply or divide anything involving a 3 digit number or larger, the result is a mess of partially displayed numbers that isn't even close to the correct result. I've noticed a couple of other Canon calculators have had similar issues (based on customer reviews). I would use caution when purchasing."
2,Good while it lasted,"I liked it at first. It was compact, heated up quickly, warm enough to thaw my daughter's hands in the cold morning but not hot enough to hurt her, recharged easily. However, after boiling/charging for the second time, one corner of the plastic bag separated/opened, and white powder came out. Bye bye EZ Heat Reusable Hand Warmer...."
1,Not Worth the Money,"Using one while playing golf, it remained warm for about 15 minutes. I must have a reject because it certainly did not ""Lasts up to 3 Hours.""Ez Heat Reusable Instant Handwarmer - Lasts up to 3 Hours"
1,Poor product-EZ Heat Reusable Hand Warmer,Hard to use since it has to be put in boiled water. Did not retain heat for more than 60 minutes. Only retained heat for 15 minutes after 4 uses.
3,CD great...but case is cracked...due to poor packing/mishandling,"What's up with not being able to ship me this with the case intact? It is a gift and who wants to give a gift with a broken case. Come on Amazon, you can do better than that. Josh Turner Rocks!"
3,A Decent Debut Album.........But,"Josh Turner has himself a decent 1st album here,but it is also somewhat uninspiring.It's hard to put a finger on but something is definitly missing.The voice is good(but let's be honest here, he's no Randy Travis, who Nashville has abandoned for slicker younger versions like Josh i guess) but the songs are perhaps too similar and tend to run together a little too much.The songs are solid country tunes but the album is forgettable and only a couple of songs will stick in your head and have you coming back for more.The songs that are the best and the ones you'll want to hear again are:Long Black Train,In My Dreams,and She'll Go On You.The worst are Backwoods Boy, and You Don't Mess Around With Jim(no need to re-record this classic)and Good Woman Bad.The rest are all right around average.I for one am hoping for better songs and material on JT's sophmore release."
3,A Mediocre Album,"I could not agree more with Jennifer Dahlgren's review of this album. Why did Josh Turner record such a fantastic song as ""Long Black Train"" and follow it up with such mediocre material to put on the album? Now I have a dilemna as to whether to buy the album on the basis of that one song. I probably will since I love that song so much - it is truly one of the best country/gospel songs I have heard in a long time. I am sure Josh will have other big hits in the future, but if I were to wait for a ""Greatest Hits"" package it may be a few years since this was his first release."
5,Natural Talent,"J.T.'s debut album is enjoyable from start to finish. ""Long Black Train"" touches the heart, as does ""She'll Go On You"". ""Backwoods Boy"", which happens to be my personal favorite, is fun and reminds me of home. J.T.'s songs have a tendency to ring true. You hear the lyrics, start singing along, and then you're transported to... somewhere else. That is the truly great thing about music, anyway, isn't it? Not only that, but his voice is all his. 100% natural. Lots of deep, strong, pitch-perfect notes throughout every song, and that is a rare thing to find, these days. J.T. should be commended for this album, but we need to light a fire under him. It was released about two years ago. J.T., where is album #2?"
4,Not my type of music,"BUT....This guy is a talented singer for his genre. My familywears ""Long Black Train"" out everyday I see them. You don't haveto like something to respect it. And yes I respect this guystalents."
5,Best new singer in this decade,"I was raised around older country songs, and has an adult it is still what I perfer. I do not like most of the new singer and groups. There are the occasional few. To me they sound too much like pop and not real country.Turner is exeption to the rule. His songs along with his voice are reminisant of the older grander days of the Grand Ole Opery.I seriously recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys the good old days of country music"
2,Very disappointed...,"I absolutely loved the title track of this album. I was so happy to hear a ""new"" country artist that still held true to the roots of country music. But when I listened to the rest of the CD, I was so disappointed. Many of the songs sound like all the other schmaltzy ""new country"" that is available today. There are a few other good songs, notably Good Woman Bad, but I could do without most of the others. This is definately not a CD that I feel lives up to the caliber of the first single, Long Black Train. I hope he comes out with a second, better, more traditional CD. On the plus side, he has an incredible voice that just sends chills up my spine. He also does not sound like every other supposed ""country"" singer out there today, and that is definitely a good thing. This CD would have been so much better had he stuck to the traditional flavor of Long Black Train and showcased his amazing voice."
2,Not what I expected...,"Before I start, let me say that Josh Turner is a talented artist with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, I don't think that talent was used wisely because this album was pretty much a huge disappointment. I don't think many of the songs on this CD were right for him... especially considering most were lacking any emotion on his part. Also, many of the songs had a similar feel to them, which didn't make this CD a memorable one.If you want to purchase the CD for the song ""Long Black Train"" (which is an amazing song), I suggest you buy the single instead of the whole CD."
5,Josh Turner,"His first CD, absolutley Great! Deep soulfull bass voice is great for anything spiritual."
3,Best Was Title Song...,"I am not a big fan of country music, but purchased this for my daughter for the title song. We had both seen the video of ""Long Black Train"" and been very touched by it. I was hoping there would be more Christian renditions on the CD, but found the usual 'lost love' ones. It's not a bad CD at all, but I was just hoping for a few more selections of the same caliber as the title song. The artist has a very captivating voice and style, regardless of the music on the CD, however."
4,Long Black Train by Josh Turner,"I grew up with county, but that was my parents music, and ""mine"" was rock and roll... but I love the new country now! Josh Turner has a rich, deep voice, and sings new and oldies very well! My daughter thought I bought the CD because he was cute... I didn't know what he looked like... I just love the timbre of voice! (yeah, he's cute!)I love that he started his album off with a gospel song, which is so catchy and easy to sing! Many people, even if they are religious, dedicate the last song on the album, like a token, but he's right up there in front! I hope to hear much more from this star!"
5,Great CD!!!!!!!!,"This is such a great CD. When I heard Long Black Train for the first time, I was like, ""What the heck is this""? But when I got the CD and listened to Long Black Train and all the other songs, I was speechless. He is so young and he can sing that low. I love Long Black Train, What it Ain't, and Good Woman Bad. And if you think that the CD sounds good, wait 'till you hear him LIVE in concert. It was so cool when I saw him. I love him and the CD so much. I would recommend this CD for any TRUE country music fan. (Like me!!) If you don't like this CD, you just don't like country music. So what are you waiting for, GO BUY IT!!!!!"
3,Was Ok,"It was sold as good but case was cracked disc was scratched but played ok, reason for three stars!!!!But it did pay ok"
5,Amazing debut - a must have!,"I've read the below reviews and I can't disagree more with the people who have given this album anything less than 5 stars. This album is a must have for any country fan, and any music fan who's interest in music goes beyond Britney. There are only a few artists out there who's albums you should buy for, if nothing else, the pure quality of their voice. This is one of them. Just listen to that dark, mysterious voice singing these songs and try not to get goosebumps...I dare you!It's almost spooky how much this guy reminds me of Johnny Cash. Not only is his voice very simmilar but the songwriting and the music itself remind me more than once of Johnny Cash's american albums. This is a great new talent that will most certainly add some brilliant music to the country-scene. Believe me...this is a train you don't want to miss!"
3,Meh,"This product didn't do any harm but I didn't notice a benefit worth the price. I wasn't using the whole system though. So far, though the best thing I've found for improving my skin is eliminating sugar and cutting back on refined grains."
4,Doesn't hurt,"The herbs are cleansing and Neem (one of the ingredients) is a known detoxing clay. I had an initial breakout, but it was very minor (two whiteheads on my chin) and now after three weeks my skin is the best it has looked in two years."
3,Interesting biographically,"But basically, the book is slight and forgettable. Except in Collages, Nin never really managed to put together a book that approached her diaries as literature. I read this as a follow-up to reading the Bair biography, and that kept me interested through the book itself."
3,Incredibly soft and thoghtful,"This is Anais Nin's third novel. It tells about a woman, Djuna her love, her thoughts, her emotions, her doubts, her decisions, her sacrifice . Written in a very soft and profound style."
2,an affair as self-justifying melodrama,"This is an autobiographical novel about a woman who meets a man on a boat in Paris to do it. They do it a lot and often. Then his wife finds out, and it ends in despair, with some very silly symbolism thrown in about sinking boats while on their boat. I can't say that I got much of anything out of this book, but as far as it went it wasn't too bad. What she is trying to do is portray her affair as a good rather than a dishonorable or bad thing. The execution of it is just mediocre. I do not think Nin is a distinguished writer, either in style or insight.Not recommended."
5,Lots of Fun,This book is lots of fun. Chock full one great one-liners and thoughtful analysis. It points out beauty and absurdity in what most regard as banal. As a native new yorker it was really cool to read a new perspective on The City. Highly recommended.
2,Not so flawless video....,"Laura Mercier may indeed be a very talented makeup artist when it comes to celebrities, who as we know are blessed with good looks by God. However while viewing this brief and rather primitive video I failed to notice dramatic changes after her makeover of 6 ""ordinary"" women. I didn't discover any new makeup tips for myself either. In my opinion this video is for people who have no idea about makeup whatsoever, as it provides very limited and basic information on techniques and products. (Without saying, Laura Mercier advertises her own skincare and makeup lines only). I also find Laura's roundtable discussion about the purpose of makeup to be a waste of time in this 27 minute video. My expectations for this video were much higher."
2,mostly advertisement,This tape was very basic. It seemed to promote her products more than anything else. The tips were for the biggener.Most of the tips you could get out of any fasion magizine. Laura has such talent I really expected more. I would get kevin Aucoins books. They offer lots of great tips. I just hope he comes out with a vidio!
3,Nothing special,This is a minor book. OK if your hooked on the subject or need to read about Mike Lano. Helps if your not involved in the sport.
2,fair,"This book is a fine read for people who do not know much about pro wrestling. However, fans who are true fans of wrestling and follow its happenings each week, it is a disappointing read. The book goes way off its subject and talks about guys in the business who are still trying to ""make it"" in pro wrestling and what they are currently doing. It also contains some factual errors. If you are a new fan to the ""sport"" of pro wrestling, give it a read. Otherwise, do not waste your time and money."
4,Very funny book! I laughed til I stopped....,"Archer writes about the art and science of wrestling; the ways in which it is a sport and performance art neatly wrapped together. It still doesn't answer the question: If there is a God, why is there poverty & baldness?"
2,lost in translation,"I enjoyed the movie very much and music resonated in my mind, I wanted to get a copy of the sound track, perhaps its been a while since I saw the movie but was fairly disappointed at the soundtrack, which lacked a lot of the soulful and passionate influence depicted in the movie, the vocals where lost, not there at all ... dont get me wrong, the music was still good but conflicted with my expectation of what I enjoyed in the movie itself.... perhaps its because it was more instrumental sounds versus vocals.. I dont know, but I have not played it since I bought it ...sorry!"
4,Passionada soundtrack,"Loved this film, especially the music so I had to buy the soundtrack. If you like Portugese Fado, you will love this."
5,"Great, no-slip picks","I was given one of these picks a few years ago by a random guitar player I met at a missions base. He said it would change the way I played. So right! I don't use anything else now! The picks are very durable, and the star hole design in the center really gives the added grip you need to never drop a pick. I buy these things in bulk now, mostly because I have a tendency to leave my picks lying around everywhere, but also because I like to give them to fellow guitar players in a ""Pay It Forward"" kind of way. ;-} Once you try them, you'll never go back!"
5,Bam-A-Lam!!!,"If you are a Tom Jones fan, this album is a must.. and if you're not, BUY IT AND YOU WILL BE, you'll be playing it over and over again til it's plum worn out :)"
5,perfect for a gift to a tom jones fanatic,"My friend was so happy when she received this as a birthday gift. 1st of all, she is a Tom Jones fanatic so this was an easy choice as a gift. The selling point was that I knew all of the songs so I sing with her anytime she plays the cd."
4,Tom Jones Reloaded is loaded!,"Tom JOnes reloaded is a great package for new and older fans.All his great hits are here as well as new material. Songslike sexbomb, mama told me, black betty, if i only knew shouldappeal to younger fans as well as older ones. Of course thereare the classics like not unusual, Delilah and Thunderballmake this a great album. Tom Jones has one of if not thebest voice of all time and there will never be another likehim. Highly recommended."
1,Really poor quality recordings,The CD sounds like someone used an old fashioned recorder to copy the songs off some other source. Really bad sound.
4,Review of Tom Jones CD,The CD arrived at the expected time and was sent in a mailer with no damage to the CD. It plays well.
5,Tom Jones- CD Reloaded: Greatest Hits,"If you're a Tom Jones fan, then this is the CD for you. It has all his biggest hits and more. I can listen to this CD for hours upon hours."
2,Timex gps watch,For gps capabilities you must carry an extra accessory. This is not desirable when running long distances which is why the watch was purchased and promptly returned. Seller was excellent and very understanding.
4,"Nice features, fairly easy to use",This monitor/watch is a fun tool to track heart rate and speed/distance. My only complaints are that it takes an excessive amount of time to link up to a GPS and the display is pretty small because there is so much information on it. Watch fits great and HR rate monitor is reliable but GPS technology needs some refining.
3,Frustrated,"I purchased this system to help with tracking my pacing and distance when training for the half marathon. But although the Bodylink system works well, there are a few problems with the watch design that if I had known I would not have purchased this item:It takes too long to acquire the satellites.It SHUTS down if I am inactive for 10 mins......this has happened to me several times when starting a race....So unless the race starts as soon as I acquire the satellite, I have to be running in circles to keep the watch functioning before it automatically shuts off. There is no way to disable this feature.So although I love having the watch and checking my pacing, I am tired of the frustration I endure when ever I try to use it to compete in a race."
2,Too Small,"When I opened the package I realized that this is definitely a woman's watch. That's fine, because I got it for my wife, but I was hoping to use it too. Then, within the first 5 minutes of having it out of the package, the battery door on the GPS unit got stuck and I broke it trying to un-stick it. I managed to rig it to work.When I took it outside to try to acquire the satellites, I found out that the light that shows if you have the satellites is not nearly bright enough to see in the sunlight.The watch is not medium sized as advertised, but pretty darn small. That's fine, but the main screen for exercising has three lines of info on it. The numbers are so small, you really have to look at it, not just glance at it like I am used to doing with other HRMs.Other than those issues, it did work well!"
2,Not water resistant watch :(,"LIKES: Good small size for small ladies' wrists. Still easy enough to read the data on the screen. DISLIKES: Mine was not watertight and is now DEAD after a 400m swim. It is the third Timex watch that I've had problems with and I'm unlikely to buy one again because of the bad run I've had. This one was completely no good for swimming with - pretty disappointing, but probably out of warranty period now."
5,The Rough Guide to Germany by Gordon W. McLachlan,"Really a quite excellent source of information covering off the beaten track, for the self-exploring traveler, advice, regarding accommodations and tourist sites. Recommendations I gleaned from this guide provided me with a truly memorable vacation in Southern Germany such as attending a dragon festival that had its origins in the 14th century Bavarian forest village of Furth-im-Wald. If you like your traveling independence, but only wish you had a friend who lived in the neighborhood who could makes some suggestions, you'll love this book."
1,Not What It Advertised!,"This guide promised to be the most extensive guidebook to Germany, a must-have for people relocating to this country. It's great if you happen to live in one of the cities it covers, if not, you'll still have to wing it. The information contained in this book is readily available in many other travel guides in better formats, too! The book is too thick to lug around while traveling and is not very entertaining, even in the bathroom! I would advise people planning to visit or move to Germany to pick a different guidebook."
1,I hated this book!,I was living in Germany at the time and this was my least favorite guide book. I really disliked the way it was formated and the fact that some of the info was wrong. Yucky book!!!
1,Incorrect Size,The low rating is only because you can't rate what had to be returned. Amazon doesn't give you a review option for that. These didn't fit. Returned them and correct size was not in stock. Very dissapointed. Realy wanted these shoes.
2,Not feeling the support,"This product does not come in the S-shaped curve that I expected it to have, in order to provide good lumbar support. I work at a sedentary job and I've used hard plastic lumbar support that keeps me from slouching. This product it far too flimsy and will not keep you upright for an extended period of time."
5,A little different than pictured,"I just received this set today, and there is one small change with the set as pictured. Instead of the tree, you get a parrot in a cage, and there is no cat. Otherwise, it's exactly as pictured (bed, pillows, lamp, nightstand, mirror, bed-tray). It's still a very cute set, and well worth the money. But expect these changes if you order it."
4,Small hands w/small items,"I was purchasing furniture for a specific dollhouse -- this was a little large; however, the detail was very good."
1,Anti-German bigotry from the extreme left wing,"I am appalled that this kind of book which has such a racist title is even being sold on Amazon. I would never read this book, because I hate racism. Hinckley is extremely intolerant and anti-German propaganda, in my own observation."
3,Doesn't come close to the fantastic Giorgia,"Greatest hits? Or just a bunch of cheesy pop songs? This album is not too bad, but by no means is it anything special. Laura's voice is husky and phlegmy and gets annoying after a while. You find yourself wanting to hand her a kleenex so she can clear her throat. If you want Italian music that's polished and mature, vocal strength that will absolutely blow you away and lyrics that will sing to your soul - Forget Laura Pausini. Forget Mariah, Whitney and Celine. GIORGIA is your best bet. Not only is she the most talented female artist and song writer in Italy, I'll make the brave statement of saying Giorgia has THE most stunning voice in the world. Laura Pausini can't compare."
1,AWEFUL!!!!!!!,LAURA PAUSINI IS A HORRIBLE SINGER!!!!!I MEAN REALLY!!!IF YOU WANT REALLY BEAUTIFUL LYRICS ACCOMPANIED BY A BEAUTIFUL VOICE THEN GIORGIA IS YOUR ROUGHTE.NOT TO MENTION THAT GIORGIA WRITE ALL OF HER OWN MATERIAL. LAURA CAN'T EVEN GET THAT RIGHT!!!GOD WHAT A TERRIBLE VOICE!!!!!
3,Beautiful singing voice. . .,"This is my first Laura Pausini CD. It didn't meet all my expectations. Pausini has a beautiful voice, but some of the songs are overproduced, i.e., overwhelmed with instruments, that drown out or distract from her singing. I would have preferred a more ""unplugged"" CD that allows her voice to shine.If you like the type of songs Celine Dion sings, you'll probably like Laura Pausini. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of Celine Dion so you know my preference and bias when I rate this only a 3-star."
5,"""The best of Laura Pausini"" is indeed the very best","A great seven years collection of wonderful hit songs full of touching words, sung by a strong charming voice.Laura Pausini is definitely one of the best singers of this generation or maybe I'll be a bit biased and repeat what Bocelli said about her: ""il miglior cantante del mondo""."
4,Light and enternaining,"A well composed CD, with mostly slow musics.Listen to 'La Solitudine', a hit song in France, and 'Gente'. If you like them, you would probably love the rest."
2,"Great for period details, but not up to scratch","I too was disappointed that so much of this was black and white as portraits of costumes translate poorly without their original colors. I also was quite disappointed that for the size and scope of this volume, no items of clothing or jewelry pictured were personally Queen Elizabeth's--although rare, I know a few items DO exist as I've seen photos of a few jewels, an embroidered petticoat, a far-too-close up photo of a bodice, and the underclothes used on her funeral effigy.A definite lack in a book concentrating on the wardrobe of the Queen herself! I had so hoped to see examples of items worn or used by the Queen. Thank heavens I requested this from the library! Plus for being black and white, and lacking real items of the Queen, it's as heavy as a phone book!I will say though it does give many great examples of Renaissance costume, and it's most worth a peruse for history and costume enthusiasts, but my little Rennie heart wasn't fully satisfied."
1,Misleading and rudimentary,"After spending so much effort in his first book, talking about how important it was for the world to know the Mo Pai tradition and that was why he was entrusted with it...this book yields none of it. Apparently its SO important to give to the world, but perhaps only at his school.This book's misleading title (yes, I read the review of WHY it was mis-named and NOT the author's fault...but this does not detract from the empty title) has nothing to do with Nei Gung. You get a couple of Chi Gung meditation forms in the back that ANY book has. The rest of the book is pure speculation that talks about how the Greeks and western world were aware of chi (there exists far more evidence than what Kosta came up with, if you do the right research...his stuff is tenuous at best).All in all, I'm disappointed at the time I spent WISHING for this book (eager to see a touch of what the Mo Pai tradition was), and the money I wasted."
1,Buy a dvd instead,"This book by no means measures up to its predecessor. It seems as if the author has nothing more to write about, but tried writing anyway. Don't get me wrong, I don't doubt John Chang or his abilities. However, this book doesn't seem to promote him or his traditions. Instead, it seems designed to promote the author and his new organization. As opposed to giving testament to skill as in the Magus of Java, the author only offers inferences to his ability. If this book is an attempt to promote himself, he should take a marketing class or two so that he can play, not only to his established audience, but also to those new to the martial traditions.He attempts to draw parallels between Greek/Roman mythology and Nei Gung. There might be points in common, but that's not why I bought the book. I bought it for more information on the Mo Pai tradition. Not secrets, just more information. The author failed to deliver."
1,No secrets,"I have a lot to thank Kosta for. I was able to find his master after reading his first book. However his latest book does not share the secrets of the warrior sages. Rather it gives Kosta's philosophy about life and , it is easy to read and entertaining and I share his hope that more and more people through whatever meditation they come into contact with, will evolve and bring mankind to fulfilment."
2,Didn't live up to the promise!,"Sorry Mr. Danaos.Let me summarize the book's entire nei kung instructions. Do some - 1) sitting meditation (preferably in the full lotus), 2) standing meditation (horse stance). Start at 10 minutes each and work up.Well, that's it! The rest of the book consists of Mr. Danaos drawing analogies of Taoist Nei Kung practice with other ancient civilizations - especially Greek, of course and espousing his theories on how the chi paradigm fits in with modern science....Sorry again, but it was a very disappointing read."
5,Awesome book. Too bad some people can't read.,"Well the book was great. Real good followup to ""The Magus"".It was really funny to see some people didn't find it substantial, simply because it didn't teach them the neikung. Actually I think Mr.Danaos showed a great deal for a beginner to start off with. I guess if someone REALLY wants to study in this martial discipline, all they have to do is go to Mr.Danaos's site, and find their way through there. If they simply wanted it handed to them on a silver platter (or a blue-grey book), I think they probably need to refine their reading skills a bit, because it's been explained more or less in both books why something like that can't be done."
5,"Some people can't read, yet they write reviews","Well... Maybe some of the people who gave this book a bad review, should LEARN HOW TO READ!As Mr.Danaos has explained, this book isn't a neikung handbook. In fact, you CANNOT instruct people on doing such things through a book. Duh! MAYBE masters for thousands of years have been teaching their students personally, QUITE POSSIBLY for a good reason. Maybe this is why Mr. Danaos doesn't include it(if we leave out that it could be similar to giving out uzis to people; some will use them to defend themselves, while others will just flip and start off a killing spree)....If only people could pay a bit more attention to what's in there, instead of whining because they didn't ""get it easy"". Maybe they'd like a book giftset with a magical wand that'll turn them into superman, or whatever...BTW I really enjoyed the book. It was a great sequel, to a great book.Thanx and keep up the good work."
3,"Where's the beef? (I know it's antiquated, but REALLY!)","Having been so intrigued by John Chang's scenes in the RING OF FIRE documentary, I snatched up MAGUS OF JAVA which provided pleasant reading, but no beef. I thought for sure Danaos' next book would shed light on some of the REAL practices he's described throughout two books now - but still no beef. Like another reviewer said, if this system is supposed to be the salvation of mankind, why the heck isn't Danaos coughing up the system? Why can't we learn about it? I'm going to write a book about a new food that is so delicious you'd die for it, anyone can grow it anywhere, any time of year, for free, and it's the most completely nutritious food item mankind has ever known - but I'm not going to sell the seeds or even describe them. I'm going to leave you hanging. Danaos is supremely contradictory once again - this is great, let's all save the earth, but don't expect me to tell you how. Come on. I give up on this guy."
5,A gift for the mind......,"This book as well as the previous one (Magus of Java), is a kind of gift to the human kind. The author gave as a taste of his mysterious world although he could never share his knowledge with humanity... He just searched to find his destiny having a t.v documentary as his only clue (just try to imagine).With this excellent book, he takes as back to the history of human kind, sharing with us not only his opinions about the roots of Nei Kung and Martial arts, but he gives us useful instructions about safe meditation workout.If all these things are real (which I strongly believe!!), then we face a unique revelation which concerns not only the unlimited human potentials, but Life and Death itself.So try to enjoy this book and try to locate the treasures that it has to give."
1,don't waste money on this book,"lack of nei kung information, most author yaking bunch of nonsense , there no ""secret teaching"" as claim by the title"
2,Does not live up to its title,"One would think that a title like ""Secret Teachings of the Warrior Sages"" would have, something like, secret teachings in it. But the author writes that those teachings are secret...wow, I wouldn't have guessed that. In the words of one wise old lady ""Where's the beef?."" The book does have some redeeming qualites in it though. That being the exercises he gives are useful and he shares some of his experiences which help make the book a good read. If you're looking for secret teachings, look elsewhere here wouldn't be the place."
3,Interesting but Disappointed,"This book is nothing like the ""The Magus of Java"" book. Some of it is kind of dull and boring and based solely on the author's beliefs and opions. It shouldn't be tittled ""The Secret Teachings of the Warrior Sages"", because it doesn't reveal any so called ""secrets of the Warrior Sages"". I was very disappointed for having waited too long for this book, hoping that it will reveal something that can learn. If you're interested in Greek history and the author's opions about society today, then this book might be of a little interest to you."
2,Is the Author Putting Us On?,"I wrote the above comment when I reviewed the author's first book. I cautioned that we may be getting a oriental Casternada Shaman here and to be careful. Seperate the fact from the fiction. The proof would lie in THIS book.If we get good believable techniques than Danaos is giving us the truth. I would be persuaded.So what did we get? Nothing. really nothing. More esoteric Taoism, some interesting, but impractical unusable concepts about Chi Energy. Danaos is now on the spot. Will we get the continuing saga of this mysterious but unavailable Qigong Master? Who could make a fast million bucks taking the Randi Challenge. I know Chang promised his master he would not go commercial.But Danaos DID NOT. He is obviously making money off these two books. He knows enough fancy Qigong by now to challenge Randi, but he won't.Fascinating book, but read it with your BS meter on high."
1,Nothing here,"Short and sweet.When a book has the words ""The Secret Teachings of..."" in the title and then includes no teaching inside... you have yourself a bad book.I read this book and his first book twice each. I wish I had spent that time doing anything else."
3,interesting read,"an interesting look into a secretive form of chi training by an author who is well read in philosophy and apparently physics. While this ( book)is interesting , it is simply a tease because while the information tells of human potential- you as the reader will not be given any useful way to develop these potentials( iguess this is where the secrecy comes in). Better to research others who advertise a genuine training regime that match up with their claims of wanting to assist humans in their evolution."
4,A glimmer of musical hope in a world of boy band crap,"First of all, if you ding Golden Smog for having done a couple of covers on it, then you clearly don't understand them, their reason for getting together in the first place, and music in general. You obviously have no grasp of their history as a band. Thier first album was done ENTIRELY of covers. This group is a side project for all involved, and when you sign on for the experience, and pays your monies, you takes what you gets. This album is fun, and damn good, and the ONLY reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me, unlike Another Fine Day, is that it is that I wish it were longer. Thank god (tm) they continue to make music in an era when no talent clowns like Justin Timberlake are allowed to assault us with their particular brand of dreck, MTV kids with gnat-like attention spans want all their music on their cell phones and you can't make a dime selling CD's. 'Nuff said."
2,Just not good,"This was a real disappointment for me. I really like these guys, but it was a bad idea to put this out. Sounds like they had fun, but it sure isn't fun listening to it.Skip this one - I wish I had."
3,Golden smog,"First of all the CD has only 9 songs. That's pretty disappointing.When you consider , especially since two of the songs are covers. Also the sound lacks clarity and reminds me of 60's and 70's recordings.There are some decent tunes but all in all a poor effort in comparison to previous works."
5,An amazing collection,"I have held off buying compilations of 50's and 60's instrumental rock music, never satisfied with the CDs out there, and not sure I could sit through so many purely instrumental recordings. Well, this CD put that concern to rest. If you have always thought the old rock instrumentals were lame, watered down, 3 cord pap from bands who could not sing, think again. This grouping of some of the best instrumentals from that era should change your mind. Yes, most of these cuts are available on many CDs (I must have Lonnie Mack's Memphis on at least 3 others) but this mix does not have one truly weak link. I listened to it the first time on a long road trip last week, and must have looked weird shouting and slapping my hands on the steering wheel. The wailing sax in Tall Cool One and Bust Out - and the strollin' line dance image from Doggett's full version Honky Tonk, and on and on. Here's hoping Varese follows up with another like this."
3,a pleasant surprise for fans of all types of music,"well, this music isnt really what one would call ""my style"". to give you an idea, i am obsessed with radiohead, coldplay, and interpol. however, i picked up this cd, and found myself enjoying the music. sure, it isnt anything life changing or brilliantly crafted, but its good music that i enjoyed listening to, and so will you."
3,Campfire Girls - 'Tell Them Hi' (Interscope),"Every bit as decent as their previous 'Delongpre' title (see my review). With this sophomore effort of the Campfire Girls, the music tends to sound a bit more polished. Tunes I was digging the most were ""Junkman"", ""Someday"", the dual guitar riffing piece ""Day Before"" {possibly the best track here) and ""Tragic End"". Once again - decent post-grunge but nothing to over-the-top to trill your gorilla."
2,Wish I knew then what I know now!,"I bought Web Easy Pro without knowing anything about web site design. Web Easy taught my quite a bit. for all I learned I wont' get my $... back for what I paid. Text blocks will publish as GIF, Then right when you think you have finally published a working site, the thing looks like ..... Then you have to juggle things through trial and error, then you might have it. Then it will pick an arbitrary page and make it your home page.Web spiders don't even stop by Web Easy pages, thats gotta hurt business!!! Oh, and for a kick if you use meta tags, Web Easy uses its' own instead of yours."
1,my dock stopped charging,I have a 2nd generation iPod. I bought this to charge and sync like the new iPods do. This product did this for a couple of weeks and then stopped charging my iPod.
5,So so so cool!!!!!,"Unbelievably cool. Works much better than anticpated and has even stood up to a four year old's beating!!! Fun and cheap. Tiny, but that makes it better so it can maneuver in the tub."
3,only for blink 182,the real reason I bought this dvd was to see mxpx and Blink 182. The mxpx video was good but the blink stuff didn't cut it. they should have had the dammit video on it
3,Only for Blink,I thought this dvd was going to be a great punk rawk dvd but I was wrong. Every video suck especially all the ska. way to much ska. I liked the mxpx video and guttermouths saves the day was all right. Blink should have had the dammit video on here. they could have done better.
4,not as good as season 1&2,Its just not a good as the previous ep. DVD boxed set is like any other TV series on DVD.
2,american dad,the first few episodes were the same as the last volume. but the rest of the series was your typical american dad.
4,Love this show,"Love this new box set, HOWEVER there are few eps, fox said would be included, that are not, tearjerker is not included"
3,Ashes-A logical progression,"I expected much more from this CD based on the reviews I read before I got it from overseas. If MH wouldn't have released The Burning Red and Supercharger(and I wish they wouldn't have), this would have been a logical progression with the new line-up. I expected a little more from the songs since Demmel and Flynn are back together. The songs are well-written and show the growth of the band although they come across as trying to be little 'epics'. I think Flynn's attempts at melodic vocals are admirable but he sounds better when he barks his lyrics. He conveys alot more emotion that way. Overall, this is a well done CD, it just doesn't have the unique MH sound that Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change have, I hear too many influences and sounds of other bands for it to be a favorite of mine. If you're just getting into MH,this is a good primer. Just make sure you get their first 2 CDs as well."
4,MACHINE HEAD back to BRUTALITY.,"Burn My Eyes again, unbelievable album, thank-god they are back and better than ever. Although i am a fan of Superchanger and burning red, i am aware of the blades they took. It's great to see a band that has been around so long and has kept Thrash/Heavy Metal well and truly brutal. I believe the opening and the last song are the 2 best on the album. None the less they have compiled a sweet ass selection of songs. Tearing riffs, angry screams, melodies... Hell Yeah. If you only buy one album this year, consider this to be well worth your dollars."
4,A Wonderful return to teh days of old,"While I enjoyed the Burning Red it is nice to see them go back to what they are known for, straight up groovy bay area thrash with hints of melody.Machine Head have stepped to the plate and made the most devastating release since The More Things Change. Reccommened tracks, VIM,IMPERIUM,SEASONS WITHER,BITE THE BULLET AND WIPE THE TEARS."
3,NOT Burn My Eyes,"Don't believe the hype. This ain't Burn My Eyes. Imperium is, but the rest of the album isn't. Machine Head is a great band with unbelievable potential, but most of this album is the same old same old from the last couple of albums. Demmel should have pulled out and finished the new Vio-lence. Now THAT would be real old school thrash."
2,NO. Not the old Machine Head. At all.,"With the exeption of a very few moments on this cd, there is absolutely no resemblence of any good Machine Head here. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because compared to The Burning Red and Supercharger, it is definately an improvement (Not sure if it was possible to get worse.)Rob Flynn again absolutely butchers any thoughts of decent vocals, and the lyrics are absolutely ridiculous. The bass work is good, but the drumming is again nothing new, and ultimately sub-par. It might have worked 5 years ago, but not now.Their old guitarist gone (*whew*), Phil Demmel steps up with a vengeance. The guitar work on the cd is good, and even though Rob has no business singing, him and Phil mesh very, very nicely with some well composed playing.Bottom line: Dont buy it if you think it's going to be like Burn My Eyes, or even The More Things Change. You'll be as upset as me."
5,Buy this CD!,"This is a must have along with Master of Puppets, Rust in Peace and Reign in Blood. Just get it"
1,Horribly sad band..horribly sad CD....,"This is a pathetic band. They suck so bad! If you want a really good band, look at Pantera, Superjoint Ritual, Down, or Chimaira. Robb Flynn can't hold a candle to Mark Hunter or Philip H. Anselmo(God)"
5,"Best record since ""burn my eyes""!","I grew up listening to these guys and I will admit that the fir st I had heard of them was from 'the burning red' album ie:the blood the sweat the tears, but regardless, no matter what,Robert,Adam, Dave and thier new axe man Phillip Demmel are exceptional at writing the most versatile metal record ever! I listen to loud stuff all the time and have u ever noticed there's a song that fits any part of every-day life on this album? wanna get pumped to go skateboard? listen to Imperium. Had a bad day? liten to 'Wipe the tears'. Driving around town? 'All falls down'.A moment with your significant other? 'Decsend the shades of night'. Get the idea? MH R BACK!"
3,Just ok,Im definitely not a huge fan of Machine Head and this album is another just ok album by them. There are no tracks to make the difference - its simply a metal band with average songs.
3,well done,"A masterpiece for the producer, not the band. This band is strange in that although they can't really make up new riffs or new music in general, but they still pass on this feeling of intensity or power that sets them appart. I remember a few years ago I really wanted a heavy band with emotion and I got machine head, but now all I hear are the lyrics and think ""oh god that's terrible."" Robb cannot still be feeling all this pain after so long and so much success. Oh he's ""so alone."" get over it goddamnit and write something that you care about that is happening right now, not at ""the age of five years old."" I mean jesus, I go to poetry web sites to make fun of lyrcis like this. Anyway, I appriciate the feeling that I get from this music even though i've heard it all on their first albums over and over. It's that epic sound that the kids eat up."
5,THE BEST MACHINE HEAD ALBUM EVER!,"First off, I have to say that every review posted here is true. This is Machine Head's finest master piece to date. I've been an MH fan since Burn My Eyes, I've bought every album, seen MH live 14 times now. Why this album has been held up by Roadrunner USA is beyond me. Good job Roadrunner UK for picking this album up!Through The Ashes Of Empires is worth buying right now! Don't wait till it gets to the United States. Buy the import! Worth every penny! You will not be disappointed! Absolutely MH's best album to date. If you liked Burn My Eyes, You will love Through The Ashes Of Empires! I haven't been able to stop playing this album over and over since I got it. Robb Flynn and MH get 5 stars from Nor Cal Thrashers!!!!THIS ALBUM IS HELLA AWESOME!"
1,Disappointing,"I'm a big Marty Stanley fan, so I bought this book for the illustrations. The illustrations are beautiful, but there aren't many and they're printed too small to fully enjoy. The premise for the stories about the Delta sounded interesting, but I'm afraid I found them too boring to read. Also silly, and a bit offensive in places."
3,"Repetitious, no surprises","I had to quit reading this book at page 189. Terminal boredom had set in. I wish Jacoby had written her book in chronological order instead of dividing the chapters by subject matter. Maybe then I would not have had to hear over and over about her nasty grandmother, brilliant uncle and unloving grandfather. I never felt like I knew these people or empathized with their emotions. Jacoby added some interesting insights into the history of Jewish-Americans, but not enough to support a book-length account of her ordinary 1950s childhood. Turbulent Souls by Stephen Dubner and A Good Enough Daughter by Aliz Kates Shulman are far better examples of this genre."
3,one of the great books on philography,"This book was one of the first great books on handwriting (philography). It is dated, but still very relevant as far as collecting autographs. Hamilton was the greatest handwriting expert who ever lived. He passed away in 1996. At one time, even the FBI went to Charles Hamilton to identify signatures."
5,Sigma 8mm Circular Fisheye is Top Quality!,"This Sigma lens is like a working piece of art. The build quality is high, the images are bright and sharp with excellent color saturation. I use mine to shoot full-screen 360 by 180 panoramas and the results are breathtaking! The best part is that this lens costs 1/3 to 1/4 of what the Canon 8mm lens costs. It's an awesome deal, no matter what way you look at it. The Sigma 8mm is definitely a professional grade lens."
3,"optics excellent, AF speed very slow, not internal focus","Optical quality of this fish eye is very good. Flare control is excellent. However, AF speed is very slow. Takes 2+ seconds to move from closet distant to infinity. THe slowest AF speed lens among my other 14canon lenses. Also, during AF, the AF ring moves. I would like to be internal focus or at least the AF ring doesn't move. They didn't design a clutch to disengage the AF ring.Pros: optical qualityFlare controlCons: AF speedAF ring moves during AF"
3,Smaller image than you think,"Good quality but on my Canon 5D, the circular image is pretty small. I was hoping it would be snug top-to-bottom to maximize pixel count. the lens may have been made for a 1.3 or 1.6 crop factor DSLR. That said, it's a HUGE improvement from my Nikon FC-E8 on a 995."
5,Professionally used for years in the film industry,"I work in the VFX industry doing computer generated imagery for multi-million dollar movies and this lens is not only a must have but it's the best one you'll find. Very high quality, consistent and a work horse.I'd also recommend using this lens in other professions. Perfect for making 360 degree Quick TIme VR movies.For fun.. this is a HUGE hit at parties. You'll get some great results and everyone gets so interested when you put the lens 2 inches from the face to take a picture!ProsDurableEasily interchangeableConsistent outputStrong constructionLightweightConsHeavy"
2,Pride FC's Sad Farewell,"Pride 34 is Prides Last Event, sadly. What is also sad is the event itself. It was put together really quickly (as Pride was gasping for it's last breath) and it was a scramble to find fighters to take part. Great fights were rumored to be on the card before it was actually announced but those fights didn't materialize. As far as the fights go, the Soko fight vs Arona is good and the Thompson v Frye fight is entertaining but that's about it. If it was priced at $9.99, I would say buy it(if you are a Pride fanatic and collect them all)But, if you are an mma fan looking for a dvd of great fights, don't waste your money on this one. It is not worth $17.99. R.I.P Pride FC, thanks for the wonderful memories."
3,Still consistent but musical quality suffers a bit...,"Still very good but it seems that Jack spent a lot of his musical and lyrical ingenuity on the first album and he starts to run out of ideas... I mean, not that there were too many ideas to begin with. After all, his is pure and simply music of relaxation, surfing abandon, get-mellow-and-chill-out kinda stuff and one simply shouldn't expect too much. Still a very worthy album and I enjoyed several songs very much. Favorites - ""The Horizon Has Been Defeated"", ""Holes To Heaven"" are superb and a couple of others are really good."
1,Same thing over and over,"I have to tell you... I am really really really disappointed! I love the first JJ album, but this one is really really bad! he really did not put any effort to make this second album, he basically repeated the same riffs over and over! Maybe he should have waited a little more, and get new inspiration before coming out with this album! I am really sad about it, but this is my honest review."
4,Awesome Recording,"I was first exposed to Jack Johnson's music when he appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and once I'd heard him sing, I knew that I had to find his CD. I am a huge fan of Dave Matthews, and Jack Johnson's lyrics, and his sound in general, remind me of something that you would hear on a DMB album - that's a big reason why he's become my favorite new artist. He has a really mellow sound to his songs, and although his lyrics may seem kind of ""out there"" at first, once you really listen to what he's trying to say, you come to appreciate his music on a whole different level entirely. My favorite songs on this album would have to be Times Like These, The Horizon Has Been Defeated, Taylor, Gone, and Dreams be Dreams, among others. If you like the mellow sound of artists like Dave Matthews, then I think you'll really like Jack Johnson."
4,Magical surf style relaxing beach bummy vibe,"Jack Johnson, also a professional surfer, puts out some amazing sounding tunes on this new album.""cookie jar"" is a good commentary of how today's youth grows up.""Horizon has been defeated"" is very cool and has a funky beat. Fun. Check out Brushfire Fairytales as well. ""Flake"" has soft steel drums woven throughout, casting you to some secret spot in the pacific.Just good plain ol' folkish- funkish pop rock. It will pick you up. Check it out."
1,The vinyl issue has distortion. No wonder is was so cheap.,"Vinyl LP ""On and On"" sounds muddy in loud passages with vocals having a lot of distortion from start to finish on both sides.Washed it. No luck. Checked my turntable setup. That's not it. My 300 other LPs sound great including my copy of Jack Johnson In between dreams. This boggled me so, I again double checked everything. From what I've read by others, the entire pressing has quality issues.Stuck with sending my copy back for an exchange hoping I get a better pressing."
2,I wished JJ stretched his legs a bit more on this.....,"Sorta hate to be the voice of dissention here...but I was quite disappointed w/this disc. I loved BF within the first 2 listens but found this to be just too....repetitive I guess. I was hoping JJ would've expanded his sound a bit more, or at least mixed it up more than was evident here. I enjoyed the 1st two tracks and was looking forward to the rest, but then it just seemed to me that it all sounded VERY SIMILIAR. While BF had very diff't rhythms and sounds to most of the tracks I viewed this offering as a fallback on a tried and true recipe, almost as if he was determined to make this album sound enough like the first so that it would be successful. For me, it wasn't."
5,Jack does it again,"Well, this, the second album by Jack Johnson, is just as fun as the first. He's back with his beutiful guitar and voice and he has no trouble making you relax. This CD(along with his first) make me think of summer when ever I listen to it, and when it is summer, it feels like paradise. I think this is a must buy for people who liked his first CD, or people who are fans of Ben Harper.P.S. The album cover looks wicked!"
4,I think I might actually like this better than the first,"This CD hits it's highs with Traffic in the Sky and the last two songs Mediorce Bad Guy, and Symbol in My Driveway. The songs are little less poppie (if that's even a word) than the first, and the songwriting is better to me. I like the mood this album as taken as well over the first. I can't wait to hear more out of Jack Johson."
5,As good as Brushfire Fairytales!,"""On and On"" is just as good as Brushfire Fairytales. There are 16 great songs on the album (The Horizon has Been Defeated is my favorite so far) and it's nice to know that his mellow voice hasnt change at all during his transition between albums. If you like Ben Harper, John Mayer, Pete Yorn or Ryan Adams, you will like Jack Johnson."
3,"Good, but not that good.","It's a pretty good album - solid, melodic, peaceful. But it's lacking something that Brushfire Fairytales had: variety and spirit. There's comfort in On and On, but it just doesn't pop the way its precursor did."
5,A Fabulously Solid Album!,"This is a truly solid album. I can think of only a handful of cd's that are a pleasure to listen to track after track -- this is one. Fans of Brushfire Fairytales will like this album as much, if not more, than his first, and will appreciate his consistently strong melodies fused with fresh lyrics. On and On is just about the perfect summer album -- full of catchy groves and harmonic simplicity. Of course, with such great tunes as Traffic in the Sky, Times Like These, and Rodeo Clowns, I'm sure this will stand the test of time at least as well as Jack Johnson's first album did."
3,On and On and Off To Sleep,"Jack stunned the music world with his crisp and clean style that teams well with todays Ben Harper or yesturdays Tom Petty. Three cords and we're off! On and On was a nice attempt to continue that dream - but after a few songs, you start to realize that this is all too familar. It is a good record - but nothing special./"
5,Cool and Refreshing,"This is the kind of music that makes me want to sit on the beach with the ocean breeze on my skin and an ice-cold bottle of beer in my hand, yet in addition to being extremely mellow, the lyrics have a social conscience. ""On and On"" has a lot to say about materialism, societal complications, violence and shirking responsibility.Jack Johnson is an excellent writer and musician and I recommend this album to anyone who appreciates the singer/songwriter genre or who just wants a good album to chill to."
4,Good in a different way,"""Brushfire Fairytales"" is a must buy CD, and one of my favorite CDs up to date, and ""On And ON"" also provides very good music but in a somehow different way from ""Brushfire Fairytales"".Most of the songs from ""On And On"" are short and very easy to listen to. This is a great CD for a sunny Sunday morning music or 3-hours long drive music. For those of you who have owned ""Brushfire Fairytales"", don't expect this CD would be the same in terms of in-depth music creativity, but Jack Johnson's unique style is still there. However, for those of you who have not yet heard of Jack Johnson music, you will be impressed.My favorite songs include - times like these, gone, dreams be dreams, cookie jar, and rodeo clowns."
5,Awesome!,"If there's nothing you like better than to chill out with your mates on a weekend and get high, then this is definately the album for you. I was introduced to Jack's music by an Aussie on a gap year and can't stop listening to his music since. The melow rhythm and funky beats sets the perfect mood for another joint. A must have album for all you smokers out there!"
2,"If you like vacuous pop, you'll like this","Yep, he's mellow, and he surfs, and he's got some hints of reggae, and he wears sandals and plays an acoustic guitar. If those are your qualifications for a good album, buy this one. If you're looking for something creative and groundbreaking, an album with innovative, interesting music, look somewhere else. Jack Johnson is predictable at best, downright boring at worst."
2,"Well he is not Neil Young, let alone the second coming","This guy is way overhyped, songwriting is whiny and lacks any facts or knowledge. Guitar playing is really childish skittishes that do not really portray any talent past knowing 3 chords. Tries to act like he is some voice that represents youth but fails miserably. I added this CD to my list of things I wipe with. If you really want to hear an acoustical session that proves this guy sux, there are some others out there. Marketing is the key in todays music world instead of talent and that is why this guy sells records. The lyrics suk, he is just crying and whining from visuals he gets from NPR or something, and that alone is enough to put someone to sleep. Boring, bad and will not be heard of in twenty years. I wish the next Hendrix or Neil Young would please stand up because the posers in here right now annoy me."
2,Highly recommended by a robot,"This is my first hearing of Jack Johnson, whose album I finally bought after Amazon.com's fine recommendations robot kept telling me to go buy this or ""Brushfire Fairytales"".This album certainly sets a mellow groove. I plan to see if listening to this and Norah Jones back-to-back will cure my insomnia.The lyrics are excellent examples of what pass for thoughtful these days, particularly, I suspect, if accompanied by the lady Mary Jane, who brings out the cleverness in everyone, or something.I heartily recommend this disc to sophomores and juniors in small liberal arts colleges, people of like mind, and Barry Zito."
1,Absolutely awful,"how many times can a person's voice squeak on an album, play the same chord over and over, and well make a decent attempt of making music....this is one of the worst albums ive heard this year."
3,"I liked this album the 1st time, when it was called....","I liked this album the 1st time, when it was called....BRUSHFIRE FAIRYTALES!Honestly it is the same sound and you could forget that you are listening to his new CD> some fresh lyrics but mainly similar hooks and so forth.Worth buying...yes, but perhaps I expected more."
3,Means Well,"Jack Johnson's sophomore effort is good; it's nothing more, nothing less. He continues on with some pretty creative songwriting, but fails to take it to a new level. Lyrically he's the same ""loveable, I'm a really nice person trying to please everyone"" Jack that we grew to love on ""Brushfire Fairytails"". Some lyrics are quite confusing, for example, a lyrical excerpt from track 2, Jack boldly states ""Hallelujah Zig Zag Nothing"". Could anyone tell me what that means? Another insightful lyric from track 8, ""The children were playing cricket with no shoes."" Where does that lyric fit into an acoustic pop album? However, there are several stand out tracks on this album that will no doubt grab your attention. All in all, it's a good album to chill to, but it won't hold your attention for too many listens. One thing definitely remains clear...this guy loves surfing."
5,Jack--always a classic,This record is one of his best... I would recommend it for new listeners of Jack Johnson who are just beginning to explore his musical awesomeness.
5,Mahalo Jack!,"Jack's mellow & uncomplicated music feels good to the ears but the issues raised in the lyrics really make you think about life & our times in a tragic, romantic, melancholy way - Jack combines all this for the listeners without ever making you feel stressed or jaded out - I loved Brushfire but this is definitely a lot tighter & it sounds a bit more SEAsoned... He's definitely the man, now if only the world could produce more talents like him maybe our civilization would be able to carry ""on & on""....."
3,More of the Same from JJ,"I would like to preface this by saying that I like Jack Johnson and I love Brushfire Fairytales. That being said, I am a bit disappointed by this record. It sounds almost exactly the same as the last record, but it has less up-tempo songs. The playing is fine. The lyrics are fine, if not a bit simplistic at times. The music pretty much always sounds the same thoughout the CD (with a couple of exceptions). If you liked Brushfire, you'll probably enjoy this CD. As long as you expect nothing different at all out of Jack except the words, and even they aren't that different. Why did I need another studio recording of Rodeo Clowns? I have a feeling that unless Jack grows a bit I'll tire of him pretty quickly. I recommend Ben Harper instead."
4,An excellent second album!,"I just got this album a few days ago and I've been listening to it over and over again. If you liked his first album, you are certainly will like his second one because he didn't change his style a bit...and that's what I think is very cool. Again, his mellow acoustic mixed in with a few more poppy songs (a.k.a Bubble Toes off of BF) keep the record going all the way for 16 tracks.My personal favorites on the album are ""Horizons Have Been Defeated"", with it's reggaeish feel, ""Taylor"" and ""Wasting Time"". This CD puts you in the summer mood to just go cruising around with the top down or kicking it at the beach in your flipflops. I definitely recommend it."
5,Must Have,"Jack Johnson is an awsome artist who doesnt get the critical respect he deserves. With artists like John Mayer who is very talented in his own right getting nominated for grammys. It is hard to see how they overlooked Jack, he has the kind of mellow bluesy vibe that Nora Jones wishes she could have."
5,There's no one like Jack,An excellent sophomore release. Just as good as Brushfire Fairytales but in a different way...this album still gives me goose bumps after hundreds of listens!
2,Not nearly as good/fresh as Brushfire,"I eagerly anticipated the second installment of J.Johnson, but was unfortunately let down. His fiorst album had a vibe and sound all it's own, although several of the songs were similar in style, they were different enough to make them unique and enjoyable. On and On does just that, goes on and on sounding the same almost all the way through, very redundant and almost too similar to Brushfire without the freshness. I wouldn't recommend it, but go ahead if you want to hear his new stuff"
3,On point,"3 1/2Johnson had distilled his gentle, mainly acoustic mellow rock into a soothing science that, if predictably limited, accentuated all the proper production to keep the album relevant."
2,Your are right it did go On And On,"How did this man sell a million records? Was there some kind of beach party where his albums went on sale and you got something free with it? Granted his voice is quite pleasent but the songs in general all sound as if they came off a copying machine. I have figured out the plan you sneaky Island Records. Johnson's two albums were orginally one but you cut them up into two so that he could have 20 minutes in the sun instead of his alloted 15. Note to Johnson: you have real talent mate, ditch the beach blanket bullocks and start putting out something you can be proud of."
4,getting better...,"good tunes. better than the first. i think jack has found his sound. i can see the sunset in my head when i listen to this cd. for those that liked his first record, you won't be disappointed."
4,actually a four and a half....,"the only half pending on when i actually FINISH the cd!There are some tracks on this disc that are so amazing (I.E., ""Times Like These"", ""Gone"", ""Cupid"", and ""Cookie Jar"") that I just have to listen to them over and over.Someone once said that if I like John Mayer, I'd like Jack Johnson. After listening to ""On and On"", I don't think it's a fair connection to make. I love both musicians to death, but it's JM's guitar tricks that make him stand out while JJ has something of actual value to say it and he doesn't have to shove it down your throat.I wasn't a big fan of ""Brushfire Fairytales"", but this disc to me is definitely one of the best summer discs I've bought and I would definitely recommend it."
5,Jack Getting Better and Better ...,"Jack's new CD is amazing. I bought it three days ago and haven't turned it off yet. This CD has more ""soft"" songs than Jack's first CD, Brushfire Fairytales, and less up-beat songs like Mud Football and Flake. After his first CD I thought he could never come out with anything close to it, but this CD has showed me otherwise. If you liked Jack's first CD you will definitely enjoy this one.Top 5 songs:Times Like TheseTaylorHoles to HeavenCookie JarRodeo Clowns"
5,Excellent Album,"For those of you who love Ben Harper and G Love this is a must have. I've been listening to G Love since day 1 and when I heard Brushfire Fairytales (Jack Johnson's First album) - I said ""Ok a few a good songs. Excellent style. Need more Content."" - This album has more content.Could use a little more quick tempo songs overall but #4(Taylor) and 7,8,12,13(Remake of Rodeo Clowns from G Love and Jack Johnson) are outstanding tunes.Grab a beer. Grab your women. Sit on the deck. Watch the sunset and enjoy this album."
5,Jacks back!!!,"Jack Johnson is one artist that i can truly say i can listen to his whole album. He has amazing lyrics, great melodies, and his percussive playing ability is soothing. When you listen to this album, think Hawaii, think surf, think sand and think simplicity."
5,Such a welcome surprise.,"Jacks first CD was good, but not earth shattering, knock your socks off good. This one however, has made me sit up and take special notice! The music is easy and uncomplicated, his voice mellifluous and flowing. I love nearly every song on this CD, but pay special attention to tracks 5 and 8 which are especially soothing ...even in rush hour traffic on the Dan Ryan. It may not be his intention to calm people with his voice, or to make one girl swoon -- but he has done just that."
4,Finally Some Quality Stuff,"I really like this one. Jack has a vibe of his very own. Its good to fianlly hear some good stuff besides all of the fake MTV popstars. This cd differs from brushfire in the sense that Jack is using more fingerpicking, than the strum patterns we became so very familiar with in songs like Flake, and Bubble Toes. If you are into jack's vibe of peacefully mellow guitar with the mix of such well written lyrics this is the one for you.I'm also likeing his reggae vibe."
4,Another excellent album from JJ,"This album isn't the masterpiece that Jack's first was, but its still worth owning. His lyrics are smooth and his rhythm guitar is as good as ever. This one might even sound better on first listen, but Brushfire Fairytales is still my fav."
3,surprise,"Jack Johnson is surprising good. The style is totally mellow, and easy going. Just like a surfer telling you some awesome story about the waves, and that indeed is what Jack Johnson is."
2,Read the fine PRINT!,This product is NOT a valid passport. You can imagine my disappointment when I arrived to the airport only be denied boarding. Next time I will be going to a real passport agency.
2,His Mystery Gone,"Now, please don't hate me, but it has to be said, this album is simply neither particularly good nor memorable.Sadly, at the age of 50, Jonathan has finally grown up, and in doing so, has lost his childlike, kidult appeal. Maturity has been creeping up on him since the mid-nineties, and has finally hit, much to the dismay of many.That being said, he does some great instrumentals and ""Springtime in New York"" is...decent. I like the spanish feel, and his god-awful accent on the last tracks, but it just seems like a rehash from earlier days.If you're a massive Jonathan fan like myself, you may as well buy it, but I would suggest if you're new to his work, go for some earlier stuff or a compilation (23 Great Recordings is good, as is Action Packed).The whole album really begs the question, what on earth has he been doing for the past three years? (Clearly not using his biggest asset, his heart)"
4,Excellent,"This is the Law And Order SVU you know, almost.In the first season, 1999-2000, of what some say is the most intense of the Law And Order franchise, the characters are just being established. Those include Benson, Stabler, and Cragen. This is also before Ice-T, and Mechelle Heard plays detective Jefferies, while Cassidy is played by Dean Winters, who is now doing car insurance adds.This is in general the same show, but the sets are lit more brightly, and there is more explanation of what is now subtext in the show. You also see the characters outside of work more, to give background.There is also not a lot of terrorism as subject matter here, as this SVU ran two seasons in pre-September 11th New York"
5,Law and Order,I like this show very much. It never lets me down. Amazon is the only place to find anything you want. They are always fast and competively priced. I will continue to shop through Amazon as long as they are in business.SincerlyRobert Riddlebaugh
4,Stop complaining already!,"Geeze...the commercials are only on the first DVD and they're not very long. AND I couldn't use the ""next"" button but I did fast forward through them, but I usually just let them play while I get ready to watch some episodes.ANYWAY...I do think the DVD set could use some extras, but I only watch them once anyway so it's not a big deal to me.I love this season of SVU because they get into the characters' lives a little more than the subsequent seasons. I recently became a fan of the show so I hadn't seen many of these older episodes. If you're an SVU fan, this is definately worth adding to your collection."
5,The best,I missed the first season..the other seasons are better but they make adjustments after season 1.. I've had them for 10 years now
5,SVU,Great deal and value will definitely purchase more seasons. My daughter loves the series and we often have lazy weekend days watching tjr series
5,I like it alotttt,"I started with the Law&Order Series ""the original with Michael Moriarty and I really like the dividing up of Police work and the work of the D.A. - I cherish it. I startet to watch the L.& O. Special Victims Unit and I must say it is different, but good in its own unique way, I really really like the cast :-)!!! It is more the modern way of law and stuff, although I always have and will like the ""old and the new"". I ordered season two and three, cant wait for them to arrive. I intend to order the complete show."
5,Awesome,I wam happy with the price and the quality of the box. I was jumping around when I did receive it in the mail...it also came in the mail earlier than I expected!
5,REVIEW OF LAW AND ORDER SVU,"We are huge fans of L&O SVU at our house. This is a ""must have"" for those who try never to miss a weekly episode! Great buy and one you'll want to add to your DVD library...."
3,A Bit Rough,"I have been a big fan of this TV series for years, but I simply did not remember the early years, so I purchased the First Year on DVD. Unfortunately, unlike NYPD Blue (from the very first episode of NYPD Blue the series seemed polished and cohisive) Law and Order SVU First Year is very rough around the edges - I will probably not purchase any more of the earlier years and stick with the last few years for my collection."
1,Give it a pass,"I found the Benson and Stabler characters to be wooden caricatures.I also disliked the bouncing of lines between the the four detectives. To me, it sounded as though the script had been written by someone who was told that when all four appeared in a scene they should be given equal time!"
5,If you love L&O SVU,What is there to say except if you love SVU it is the best. It has alot of extra's in it. If you are th kind of person who watches reruns of L&O SVU on TV then this is a must have.Marbear
4,Law and Order-the Comedy Episodes,"SVU is a pretty sweet show. Why? Two words: comdeic genius. Sex crimes are funny. Dick Wolf knows this. And thus, SVU was born. It should have been called Law and Order: Pure Comedy Gold. If you like your humor black as night with some corniness sprinkled in, this show is probably for you. The first season rules because it plays up the comedy more than the later ones thus far, with both amusing plots and dialogue. What a great series. However, I cannot give the DVD five stars as it really skimps on the extras(You know, the ones that make a DVD really worth buying?). Then again, at less than fifty bucks for a season of an hourlong show, it's not too shabby. Seventeen and a half hours worth of entertainment is a decent value. So in conclusion, if you are one warped little monkey, this show is probably for you. Or if you think that because they're sex crimes they're ""hard hitting and shocking""...whatever. Maybe I'm missing the point."
5,Wonderful opening!,"I just love this show. The actors as very skilled and take on their rolls almost as though they are real detectives. Their charisma fits the subject manner, and their behavior is not as stereotypical as one might think for an evening show. The end of the first season leaves you hanging, so I was very happy that I had season two already. I would have been disappointed if I had watched it on television and had to wait! All in all, great acting, great content, great show!"
5,The First Year,"I absolutely love the 1st episode. How can you not when the guy says, ""my shortcomings"" lol...Elliot Stabler as ""Christopher Meloni"" is a wonderful actor. I love all the characters in this series..."
5,Worth watching from beginning,I have been a fan of the show from the beginning. Once you watch the first season you will be hooked. It is great to see each character evolve through the years. I do miss Chris Meloni but the new cast members are a great addition to the show.
1,If you're looking for all loose ends to get tied up....,You will be VERY disappointed. I had to check to see if a final chapter had been left off my book. The plot was loose at best and nothing was fully developed. Her characters weren't believable and their reactions were unrealistic. I don't see any woman deciding that it was unfair to punish the woman that was marrying her own secretly wed husband by refusing to make her wedding dress for her. It just doesn't hold up. What's sad is that I've enjoyed Lori Copeland's books in the past and this is not her best work.
4,Worth Reading (good),"This is one of the most efficiant and organized books I have ever recieved and is definitely worth reading. Of course with so many anime titles to list, no book or website has them all, but this book is the closest to all of them. Every now and then you find one that is not there but this book is almost guaranteed to answer all your questions about anime."
2,"Encyclopedia? Yeah, right!","This has to be one of the most frustrating books in the world. It's not an encyclopedia, it's a book of reviews! I suppose it's not a total waste of money, as long as you don't mind the way they give their opinions on almost every anime. The real problem for me is that they put down so many anime shows that a lot of anime fans [including me] enjoy. I have to wonder why the authors wrote a book on anime at all, since they seem to think that almost all are trash. I really wish they had kept their opinions to themselves and just given reliable information. Some people may enjoy this, but I definitely don't and I know a lot of other anime fans out there won't either. My advice to anyone who is thinking about buying this is that you should definitely look at it first to make sure that the reviews and spoilers don't bother you."
1,Terrible,Encylopedias are supposed to be impartial in their information. This book is just full of the author's oppinions.
4,Only as good as the latest edition,"There haven't been any major format changes or content revisions since the prior edition. More content has simply been added, which is fine, I suppose.It's a fun encyclopedia for browsing and perhaps stumbling across an anime you'd never heard of before. However, due to the haphazard and inconsistent amount of detail provided on each entry I wouldn't really recommend this as a serious research tool."
3,Comprehensive but Still Inadequate,"If you're just looking for a list of Anime's, this book is pretty comprehensive, including just about every Anime produced up to the year 2000.The problem is that it doesn't give you much, other than the basics of the plot and who created, produced, etc. Some films and series are given a lot of attention, some hardly at all. Some listings include reviews, some simply give the details without an opinion thrown in. Rarely is the animation quality and style mentioned, instead only the story is focused on.Buy the book as a reference tool, but don't expect it to really help you figure out which animes are worth watching."
3,Bought it as a gift.,The friend I bought this book for has not put it done since.I recommend this book especially if you are buying it as a gift and know nothing about Anime.You cannot go wrong.
4,I read this book all the way through...,"I do belive that the other reviews of this book only looked through it a little bit, it took me a few months but i read every single entry. and as far as giving a far synapsis of everything it does a good job. also it often tells of a history of the show, such as Robotech, or why its hard to see all of lupin the 3rd. the book is up-to-date as far as early 2001, including ""Metropolis"" entires and a little about ""spirited away"". it is also well cross-referanced if u want to see what other works ur fav series and movie creators have. if u want a quick overview (relitive to actually watching all this), or just a referance for something ur thinking about watching, definatly a good buy for the devoted anime fan."
3,Not really an encyclopedia.....,"I was a bit disappointed in how this book is more a review guide and less of an encyclopedia. There are lots of personal opinions and bias in the articles about each series.Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy also suffer from what I like to call ""Otaku Elitism""... basically meaning that nearly all ""older"" series are fantastic (read: the ones they grew up with) and newer series that have brought 90% of people to anime in America are bad ...etc....I gave this book 3 stars because of the depth and breadth of how many series are covered... but I could really care less what the authors thought or felt about the series."
1,Stereotyping is wrong,"On a firsthand basis, I have experienced what it has been like to be a pledge and I have to say, many people mis-label and are deceived into thinking that all sororities and fraternities haze, and are into drinking/drugs. The California State University campus that I attend requires the rushees to sign a form stating that no hazing, drinking, or drugs will be involved with the recruitment process. I wasn't completely sure anyway, but they were right. At all of the houses we attended involved with the Panhellenic Council, (that forbids hazing, drinking, and drugs with recruitment), the other rushees and I were only greeted with smiles and friendly faces, waiting to be invited into the house of our choice. This is not saying that I do not believe hazing goes on anywhere, just that while looking into being a pledge, research what the process is all about, before you label sororities and fraternities as hazing, drinking, and drug parties."
1,Jaded lenses,"If the challenge is to Greeks to read about the horrors of hazing, I think it should from a different source. I am quite tired of non-Greeks painting fraternities and sororities as these black-hearted, behind-closed-doors operations. National Fraternities (to my experience, since I am male) generally have anti-hazing speeches before pledging and have the pledges sign vows that they will report hazing. This text focuses on the ugliness and mistakes of a few and generalizes it to the whole population. I think that the hazing described here is from our parents' past and not what goes on now. I am sick of groups of men and women who rally behind a few Greek letters getting more criticism than any similar group (eg. athletics teams) who don't have such letters. Hazing for sports teams is still rampant... don't blame the Greeks."
2,poorly laid out and written,"I had to use this book as the text for a telecommunications class. I usually am pleased with Stallings' books and learn a lot. But not this time. There are several mistakes, and not enough examples to give one a good thourough understanding the information being discussed"
2,Not a Good Idea,"This book is outdated, not very comprehensive and hard to read. If you want a good networking book, try Comer's TCP/IP."
2,"OK, but there are much better.","I didn't find this book terribly interesting, whereas I found Andrew S. Tanenbaum's Computer Networks _very_interesting. I'd advise checking out Tanenbaum in addition (or instead of ) to checking out this book!"
2,Love them with a few flaws,"These flash cards are great. They are missing some of the alphabet signs.Such as J, P, Q and Z. And in the numbers they are missing 2,6,7,9 and 10.So for the beginner this presents a problem. The other cards are wonderful."
3,A book for the serious student,"This book has a wealth of scientific information about barn owls, and is thus more for the ornitholgist than the casual reader."
4,Freddy Kills All,"Good score, but the very brief opening title of the film (the mixing of the original Nightmare theme/Friday the 13th theme) is missing!!! New Line owns the rights - it should be on the album! One major complaint - the CD, like the film, seems to be pro-Jason with his theme played at least twice on the album. However, they did include the Freddy jump-roping rhyme and Freddy Krueger seems to have a new theme with the pre-burned Krueger scene music - a very menacing theme, too - perfect match for Englund's fine and chilling performance."
2,Oh My God - worst special effects imaginable,"This is ... a movie with a really good concept, a set of good English actors, and perhaps the worst special effects ever seen on film. It was written by well-known science fiction author John Brunner. I'd guess that they spent all their money on the decent cast and had almost nothing for the models, costumes and and actual filming. I remember seeing this on TV as a very small child and being haunted by the story. It definitely doesn't hold up to adult viewing, unless you like really awful films. I personally had to have it for sentimental reasons."
3,"It Couldn't Scare A Two Year Old, But Great Fun","This is one of those movies that you can't help but like. There is virtually no ""Terror"" to scare you ! The special effects, model work, sets/set decoration and costuming are laughably cheesy. The one note acting has to be deliberate, as some of these actors have considerable reputations. The comic relief characters,a Cockney commissary lady and a geeky/nerdy accountant, are particularly annoying. The colors are luridly too bright.Rather better are the vivid score by British composer Elisabeth Lutyens and some well worked out sound effects which sometimes blend effectively with Lutyens' music.One of those films that is likable for all of its faults."
3,description is not complete,The price is per pair. There are two in the package. Not mentioned in the description.Even the description is singular.I can't accurately rate the item yet because I can't install them until it warms up.
4,"Looks great, works great, but messes with back-up sensors","They look great and appear to be working great (wish I had got them a little sooner though). However, I have a back-up sensing system factory installed on my car and the system keeps picking up the bumper guards and beeping like mad. I had to shut off the sensors in order to keep myself from going deaf. Outside of that, I highly recommend them, but that is something to be aware of when installing them."
1,Poor Support,"I purchased this hoping it would help me set up an initial front for my business. The packaging indicated that I could download the store front piece and have my web sight up 'easy'. You could not download the software you had to call and order it and when I received my order, it was the same Web Easy software I had already purchased. I was very unhappy and went out and bought MS Publisher which I LOVE!"
1,Web Easy V 4.0,"This software was a complete disappointment for me. From the package is look like it had some great tools. One major problem, if you want to edit existing web pages, DON'T buy this software. You can not edit existing pages. They must be made in web easy. This issue proved to be a major issue as I bought this software to to edit existing pages I had already made."
1,A complete waste of money,"A complete waste of money.This program only works as advertised if you agree to store you website on the company's server for a mere [charge] a month. The ability to store your page on for example geocities is possible, but after 2 hours I sure couldn't figure out how to make it work.The program itself is sloppy. User interface screens have incomplete text, unaligned buttons.When I returned it to the store, they didn't hesitate to give me my money back, because the employee himself had returned his copy as well!If I had the option to give this product zero stars I would have."
4,Excellent book for people learning German basics.,"It has been said, that when people are learning a new language, they find out many things about their own language. The author(s) of this book take this frame of mind into account. Right from the beginning of the book they guide you from basic grammar to more complex structures, always explaining how these structures are used in German and English. I was able to borrow this book from my Germany teacher, so I am unable (leider) now to list some of the terms that are discussed in this book, but please take my word that this book is worth it.In Fact, I am going to buy it right now in preparation for my trip to Germany."
5,Very Helpful,"I'm just learning German for the fun of it. Until now, I've just been reading books and working on the Tell Me More! course. I've been making a little progress but I kept getting hung up on the grammar and realized my biggest problem is my weakness in English grammar.Based on some of the comments here and the title of this book, I decided to give it a try. I find the book an easy read that helps me understand why German sentences are structured as they are. In addition, it has brought back some of the things I learned as a kid in Catholic school.I'm certain that this little book will be a great addition to the study materials I've been putting together. I'll be taking an Introduction to German class at the local public school and I think I'll be well prepared to understand the instruction.If you are like me and just learning German for the fun of it, read this book and I'm sure your understanding of the language will improve no matter what other materials you've studied."
1,Costume for dogs.,This costume is cheap! Doesn't look like the orgininal one. And I think they should of left the pink ears of this!
2,Ehh,"I love the costume. It fit my Yorkie perfect as far as length. The only disappointment was how the hood fits. It comes down over her eyes and she HATES it. In the picture, the hood sits above the dogs eyes- this is not how it really fits. I'd like to send this back for a refund since it wont be used but it'll probably cost me how much I bought it for anyway."
2,stinker,"Although the picture looks cute, product did not fit my dog. I checked measurements, but it was too short for length and she did not like having material around her head."
4,Honey Badger substitute!,"I bought this costume to actually use as a Honey Badger for my pug. I ordered the small seeing as she only weighs 15 lbs and it fits nicely. However, since the costume drapes over the back leaving the belly area open, I also ordered a black onesie to go under it. If you have a black dog it wouldnt be necessary but otherwise it looks awkward."
3,review,I had to return the item and I am still waiting for the credit on my bill. I returned the item about a month ago. I returned it because it was to small and I re-ordered a medium.
1,Book was sold as new but was used,"I bought a very expensive out-of-print book that was advertised as ""NEW"". I expected it to be old since the book has been out of print, but still in new condition. Instead I received a used book that even had writing in it: an inscription to the people who had previously received it as a gift. This was a complete misrepresentation. To make it worse, I received an email several days later trying to bully me into changing my review. I found this not only creepy but threatening."
2,Not that great/reccommend choosing another brand,"I sent this TV back and got the Polaroid. About the same price and much better quality. The Coby picture quality was just fair, sound quality is poor and the on-scren display is sooooo small you cannot read it from any distance; not even a few feet away. Don't reccommend this TV."
3,TV works OK,"PROS: Good picture, multi-functional. DVD players works well and has the capability to scan forward in small segments. CONS: Built-in speakers are tinny; there are no output jacks of any kind for external speakers or personal headphones."
1,I never liked this show....,They were all cardboard characters. The only reason ABC kept renewing it was because they like dumb brainless TV shows (and they still do).
2,Its Time Has Passed,"As a new knitter I am always looking for books with easy patterns that I can follow and achieve good results. I purchased this book because I am familiar with the high quality of instructions Vogue provides. While browsing for knitting books on Amazon, this book kept popping up as relevant to my search so I ordered it. I have to say that I was very disappointed when I received it however, because of the horribly dated patterns. There are a couple of patterns that one might be able to make relevant and current with a wise choice of yarn and a couple of modifications, but for the most part you are going to look like you stepped off the set of Dallas if you wear anything made from a pattern out of this book.For simple and current sweaters (for future Amazonians, please note the date of this review so you know which ""current"" I am talking about) I like The Yarn Girls Guide to Simple Knits and Quick Knits, Cool Projects. I don't want to type anymore because I'd rather to go knit!"
1,Another no show.,THis book was also never received. I guess I had better check and double check what I am ordering and when I get it. Another credit to my account should be forthcoming.
3,"Very Easy, but not very Vogue","Like some people said here, some patterns represent styles of '80-es if not '70-es. There are of course some great sweaters that can still be worn today, but I would say 65% of the patters are NOT vogue these days. Easy to knit, but not very nice to wear."
2,I regret buying it.,"I do knit. But I stopped knitting many years ago. Last year I bought some cheap acrylic yarn that I liked. I didn't know what to knit. I got this book and I made one cardigan, very easy. It turned out fine. But I had to adapt to the instructions for the medium size. Then I tried with another cardigan. The sleeves were for a gorilla. Really, if I had follow the instructions it would've been a disaster. So, although I think the patterns are all easy, it may not so easy to adapt for yourself if you're a beginner. Something that I noticed is that in most of the pictures the girls, very slender, are using bigger sizes. Thus, you really don't know how the sweater is supposed to fit. In general all the patterns are for very loose items that may make you look heavier. There are two or three that are really unwearable. The is a huge tunic designed by Marc Jacobs that requires four pounds of yarn. The model has a face that is shouting ""please take this stuff from me"". I regret buying it."
1,outdated,I guess if you like 80's fashions this is the knitting book for you.I was so dissappointed in this book I returned it.
2,good concert bad sound,The sound in this dvd is awlfull.Concerts good they play all their hits. Tom rocks it out. But you can hardly hear him.and there's only like two camera shot. Good setlist bad sound.
2,meh...,Terrible sound quality. Sounds like it was recorded with a portable cassette deck. Out of focus shots. The idiot camera man in the pit between the crowd and stage has no clue. Poor video editing. Unless you're a HUGE fan of the band I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this one.
5,What an incredibly good read!,"What a great, funny fast paced read!! For a first book, the writing is superb. I'll definently be waiting for her next book!! I started it and before I even looked up I was on page 68. Don't miss this one, historical or regency fans!! You'll love it!!"
3,So-so,I wanted to like the hero. And by the end I did. But not as much as I could have. I adored Izzy! Couldn't understand why the hero couldn't realize how much he did or even be ok with it. I'm a Celeste Bradley fan so I expected more and it's always a chance you take. Looking forward to When She Said I Do:)***spoiler***The one thing I couldn't get past was the way the hero always kept trying to get with other women even after stating he would find others desirable as soon as he got izzy out of his system/ or just had her. He wanted to be a cheater he didn't seem to care at all. Put me off. But of course he admitted it to himself finally. Still felt he was a bit immature rake.
3,Just OK,"This book started off really well, but took a strange turn in the middle and never recovered. I understand how the twist was susposed to tie into one of the issues with Julian/Eppingham and his family, but then it was resolved too quickly and in a not very realistic manner even for fiction; bad guys don't just leave the house never to be heard from again. The story with Eric and Ceclia had great potential, could have been it's own book, but was quickly resolved with a sentence as the book was ending. As for the ending with Julian and Izzy, it did not seem to fit either of them very well. It was all very Izzy, but I did not think it did anything for Julian."
3,Bradley's done better,The Liars Club is hands down one of my favorite series of all time. This was a pretty decent romance novel but it doesn’t stand out the way Bradley’s other work has.
3,Okay,"This story goes in to many different directions, it starts off good and then goes all over the place. I thought it addressed to many issues."
5,Read past first chapter!,"When I first started this book I was so disappointing in the beginning, the heroin seemed airhead-ish and the the hero just boring. But since I have read all of Celeste's previous books I decided not to put it down immediately, I am glad a did! Once you get past the first chapter the book picks up and kind of changes gears portraying the characters and more life like and three dimensional. I loved the way it ended...even if I kinda saw it coming!"
5,Read this book,"fantastic! I read it in one night, I love the combined issues of sexually and the teenage struggle against conformity. The angst is layed on so thick you can almost taste it. No matter how old you are you should read this book (i'm in 11th grade)! It also would make an excellent book for a decison makeing type class for those who are entering high school."
5,Wrong item,"This is an excellent item and I have had them before so the actual product I give 5 stars too. However, I ordered this item specifically as it was a brown one to coordinate with my roof. I received a nasty looking galvanised one! Amazon did refund the money but not the shipping costs so all in all dissapointed. They should show images of what they are actually selling, not different items!"
5,"Well built, easy to install. Working nicely.","I replaced the ancient, rusted, galvanized steel turbines on my roof with these Lomanco ventilator turbines. I am very pleased with the quality and function.My only complaint is with the shipping. The ventilator was shipped in the original packaging and had no packing material. When the package arrived the bottom flashing was dented and curled at the edges. A quick hammering out solved the problem."
3,Whirlybird Vent,Recieved my Turbine and was sad to see it was not black as it was in the picture! Called Amazon and they tried to get the order straightened out and failed! This BIB-12 only comes in an factory alumiunum finish and that is it! If you are looking for a black one THIS IS NOT IT!!!!! Talked to Amazon to fix the picture and I see it is still not fixed so I hope you read the reviews! Also be prepared to fix the bent parts from the shipping! It is in a very lite box that lets the product get kicked around pretty good! Didn't install yet but I don't see that being a problem! Also I spent $[...] bucks for primer and paint! God Bless!!
2,"Perhaps I didn't ""get"" it?","The book had nice artwork, clean lines that were very good. Nicely detailed.The stories themselves I didn't find that great. One of them was a bit odd, kind of wondering what happened with the story... most really weren't worth much. Maybe these are the stories that you need to understand the context in which they were created and intended for... because I myself didn't find them too great.I'd recommend checking this out in your library before buying it."
2,Different isn't always good,"Very different from other manga but I wasn't terribly impressed. I guess I appreciate the historical context but the work itself didn't move me at all.If you want to feel estranged and depressed in a Japanese context, check out the movieNobody Knows."
5,100% Kick Ass Rock & Roll!!,"Even if you're a casual fan of the ""Stones"", Get this set!! Well worth the $$$ even if it were only a CD set. Picture quality is excellent, and the sound, especially the 5.1 Surround, is beyond excellent! I was lucky enough (and rich enough,LOL) to catch the Boston leg of this tour, and the DVD is almost as good as being there. One word of advice tho.. invite your neighbors to watch with you,, it sounds great at ""normal"" levels,, but PHENOMINAL when cranked!!!"
5,WOW!,"all i have to say is wow! one reveiw said that the band was sluggish but when you hear ""Midnight Rambler"" in Madison Square Garden and ""Honky Tonk Women"" in the England concert, sluggish is the last word that comes to mind. it's hard to find a favorite concert from the selection. the documentry is outstanding and the stones play one of b.b. king's classics ""Rock Me Baby"" under bootlegs on the first disc. i never liked blues to much but keith is amazing in that song. bottom line, they band is better than ever, the sound is better than ever, and these concerts are better than any other."
2,Marred By Poor Audio,"Love the Stones but this is just not good enough in the sound department.As others here have stated, the picture quality is pretty good but it is only one part of the ingredients.Come on Mr.Jagger & Co. show some interest in the Q.C.Dept.Lesser bands than you manage to get good results. Are you now too BIG?"
4,ePod a nice precursor to the iPad,"I bought three of the units and used them up to a year ago. There is a Windows XP hack for the system that works quite well. The problem was that the Windows CE OS that the system uses is no longer supported, and the web browser is based on IE 5. There is no IE 6 or above for the device, so most websites (today) could not be used.Does wireless nicely, used it for AOL IM and for a PowerPoint slideshow viewer. Nice system!"
1,Terrible!,"All I have to say is that this movie was awful. I was hoping for good characters, good scares and not cliche bad decisions like most horror movies. None of these characters were particularly good and the ""creature"" was laughable really. The only scary part was maybe getting lost without ever finding their way out. Typical scares really. Don't waste your time. Not worth the money to rent this."
3,Good but not great - original Format,"Though The Tunnel never really broke out and horrified me with its secrets, it did make me jump more than once. The lightning strikes of action were very well timed. I also liked the half-documentary / half-found-footage style. It added a lot to the characters and their relationships. Many other horror films kill off tons of people and leave you with a so what feeling. This time you really sympathized with the characters on how they felt about each other, and the aftermath. The Tunnel leaves open many questions as most horror does and while I feel a little frustrated by that, not nearly as much as other horror films. It gives you just enough to scare you beyond the film.A solid independent, low-budget outing. Not a must-see, but you can do far worse in the horror genre.Larry Nocellaauthor, Loser's Memorial (available on Amazon)"
4,"Not prolific, but definitely Entertaining","I rented this movie and enjoyed it quite a bit. It was an entertaining movie. It wasn't the best scary movie I'd ever seen, but I liked the plot line and the style of storytelling."
3,Not too bad but could have been better,The movie had its moments but what I didn't like was that you already knew early in the movie who was going to survive and who wouldn't. It would have been better if they gave better views of the 'creature(s)' and more background on how it originated.
2,BOOORRING,"This was a very boring movie. The setup takes a long long time ..... close to about 45 minutes and the payoff isn't really that good. I understand that this was a low budget movie but come on. Not one decent shot of the creature(s). Not even a photograph. It's just too vague. There were about 2 decent scares (what I call ""Holy Shit"" moments) in the movie but beyond that it wasn't creepy enough for this horror fan.My wife watched it with me and she scares easily, but she didn't flinch once during the whole movie (except for the aforementioned scares). There were points in the movie where you would literally hope that the director got a clue and injected something scary but he/she actually doesn't. A very play-it-safe non-scary found footage style movie.I thought it was a waste of money. NOT RECOMMENDED for horror fans."
3,Fake documentary,"I was quite interested in this show for a while, but I lost interest when I begin hearing about the ""monster"" in the tunnels below Sydney. They, of course, make it look like a true story in the beginning, even citing sources, but it ends up a fake."
1,What a waste of time!,"If I could have rated it no stars I would have. I should have turned it off right away, but I gave it a chance, the story was really dumb, left many questions when done."
2,Predictable & oh so slow...,"The first 30 minutes or so...its all build up, nothing much happens except introducing the protagonists, and explaining what leads up to their expedition into the tunnel. The remainder of the film has them exploring, then searching for a missing friend, then running from the mystery creature,...once they realize there is a creature, which you of course never see clearly. What you do see looks like a tall lanky kid with a mask on, with sort of iluminated eyes. Its the Blair Witch meets C.H.U.D. meets how to make a horror flik for under $500. I mean, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good. **1/2 is a gift."
2,Too much drama for a found footage horror movie; how about some more monsters...,"I love found footage movies, but some try too hard to build complex character relationships. The first half of this movie was painfully boring, the second half picked up when the monster appeared, but why go through all the trouble of having a cool monster that is never seen clearly? What is the payoff? Would not recommend this one."
3,HandiCam Genre Film,"Another entry in the HandiCam genre film. The movie was spooky and intense. The only reason I did not give it 4 stars because I wanted more of the ""creature"""
1,Blair witch meets sewer zombies,"Exactly the same thing as Blair Witch and all other movies of that genre, except this one takes place in a sewer. Lovely. Just as boring, too."
2,"The Tunnel, just fell short!","I kept waiting for this movie to get better, but it just didn't! this in my opinion, wasn't a good found footage movie!"
4,"Great ...slow start, but great finish!","Sorry...but I am a sucker for the found footage type films. Not ANYTHING like Blair Witch from YEARS ago??......Today's found footage has its own cult following. You either like the style and rate it fairly within that type....or dislike it n move on...but do not attach some opinion of the plot on a movie who`s style u dislike from the jump!Why would anyone watch this style of film if they dislike that emphasis?? Plus, comparing today's flix with Blair Witch, shows how little knowledge or interest you have in the document type films making of today.So, having said that....it was WORTH WATCHING-------- IF U LIKE HANDHELD/pro cam films.If not, move on and that""s cool!!!LOVED IT!!!!!!"
4,Nice family film,"A nice family film devoid of the vulgarity, sensuality and other offensive things in many of today's films. It is simple though not one I'll watch repeatively."
5,AWESOME movie,This movie left nothing to be desired - it was absolutley awesome family movie - i love the use of REAL actors- they played with emotion and you could really believe the movie - a MUST see for your family
4,Very sweet film!,"This was surprisingly a very cute film and better than I thought it would be! The ending was predictble but oh well isn't it always with horse films? lol I was very surprised though to see it was a ENGLISH RIDER film! For once I think someone listened!! =) Anyways, is very cute and would reccomend it!"
4,pleasant,Not what I expected but it was a nice family movie if you have kids I bought it because I'm a Don Johnson fan and I like horses.
1,Moondance Alexander,"I was not impressed with the condition of the DVD, especially since I was not able to watch it in its entirety, due to the disc being defected. It quit when Moondance was in the horse show competition. I tried cleaning the disc, but to no avail, there was no way of dealing with it, other than disposing of it."
2,Exploits the sick fetish of girls and horses.,The movie tries way to hard to be supercute. It exists in a time and a place which simply does not exist. Old Mr. McClancy who runs the old time general store with the old timmy register and the 50's pinball machine in the corner is stock character #1. Let's face it any business that somewhat resembles the general store has long since been driven into the ground by Wall Mart. These teens exist only in movies made for adults to show teens how they should behave. I can't say that I hate this movie since it's just so forgettable. Two Stars.
4,Terrific Family Film,"I cannot recall how I came across this DVD in the search for decent family oriented films, but thank goodness I found it. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed it as well. There is a line in the film when the character Dante, played by Don Johnson, says to Moondance something to the effect ""they pick on you (referring to the ""mean"" girls) because they're unsure of themselves."" My daughter immediately picked up on this truism as it effects her every day life. The other messages about finding the courage, perseverance, and faith in one's strengths are all foundational to a good family film like this. The music was terrific as was the photography. Buy this film for your family!"
5,Personal Perspective of a young lady smitten by a Pinto Pony,"My Wife and I watched Moondance Alexander, last evening. We were entranced! It was obviously a real and personally inspired story. The young lady, Moondance was a beautiful and charming actress. Our favorites were The Mother, played by Lori Laughlin and Dante, played by Don Johnson.It was obvious that Dante was an effective Trainer. He was also an enigematic personable character in the beginning! As the movie progressed... Moondance became his healer and in turn he became her encourager, and major influence to fill-in for her deceased Father! My Brother in Kansas is a lover of horses who owns and trains quarter horses. He often comments that working with horses everyday is far better than working with people! Since he is a Retired Army Officer, he should know!Everyone with teenage daughters should view this Movie, along with their Daughters! Gratefully, Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood"
5,"""The Wild,Wild West""-Season Three","The video and audio quality rate 5 stars,so do the 24 episodes.The packaging rates 5 stars.Unfortunately,there are no bonus features/extras of any kind on this 6 DVD set,as was the case with ""The Wild,Wild West""Season Two set.I am hoping that other fans of the show,and of Classic T.V.,complain about no bonus extras on Season 2,and on Season 3,and get Paramount/CBS Video to look into their archives/film vaults for un-used footage from the episodes,old interviews,test scenes,blooper footage,old T.V.promos,production and concept artwork/photos,because all of these materials still do exist!"
3,"Wild, Wild West programs 3rd Season","Complete set of the third season of the Wild Wild West television series from years ago. If you liked this show then, you'll enjoy it now."
4,"Wild, Wild West by Rosser",This is a great product. This is one of my alltime favorite shows. I received my order promptly and in excellent condition. Great job!!
3,Love the WWW,The first and second season were great. I was a fan of this show as a kid in the early 70's reruns. I simply love the show for it's nostolgic feel and Jim and Artie. The 3rd year suffered a bit from weaker stories and frankly is my least favorite season. But I still had to have it as I'm sure anyone who is a die hard fan of the days of their youth will too.
1,satans little helper,received the above title instead of the wild wild west season 3 because it was out of stock.instead of a refund they pulled anything off their shelf and sent it to me in my case a terrible horror movie probably worth a quarter of what they took out of my bank account.they did eventually refunded my money after i contacted them but i wonder why they did'nt do that automatically instead of sending me that piece of ****movie.did they really think i would'nt notice the difference?i will think twice before purchasing anything from a side vendor on your site from now on.
4,"Another Must Own DVD, but again, why no extras?","The third season definitely has a more western theme. There aren't any bad episodes at all. Most impressive is the transfers to the DVD format. Some of those outside shots are incredible. The episodes look like they were filmed yesterday, not 40yrs ago! However, the same old question remains, why isn't there any commentary from Robert Conrad? The way he introduced each episode in the first season, and gave some history about them was absolutely enjoyable. That is what makes DVD's treasured and worth buying. The fourth and last season will be out soon. Couldn't the studio pack it full of special features, extras, and more commentary from Robert Conrad? It would be a great way to wrap up all four seasons for sure."
4,The Wild Wild West-The Third Season,I truly enjoyed watching The Wild Wild West-The Third Season. In fact I grew up while watching the series. This is the fourth time I am watching the series. Although it has been more than fourty years since the series were first aired but the magic created by Jim West & Artemus Gordon is still there. May buy other seasons later.
5,Jim West,"No matter which season, if you're a Wild Wild West fan the series remains most exciting. Season 3, happens to be one of my favorites."
1,OMNISKY IS GONE - product useless,"I purchased this product on ebay for about 10 bucks. Well,that's all it's worth these days. With Omnisky being bought by Earthlink and Earthlink stopping the service, it's completely useless. I'm surprised to see this here on Amazon."
1,"Having trouble in Washington, DC","We purchased this for a staff member and we've had a lot a trouble staying connected. I expected the connection to be at least as reliable as a cellular phone, but in Washington, DC it is not. It is also not compatible with our e-mail system, but I expected that. We've also found the access to data while connected to the Internet unreliable - many links are dead."
2,Minstrel-less,"Why they named this product ""Minstrel"" is beyond me, as it's capacity to put on a convincing minstrel show is completely absent. I busted some of the gears up (or whatever these doo-hickey's have) trying to smear on some black application. Plus, this thing doesn't even sing classics like ""De Boatman's Dance"", or ""Stop Dat Knocking."" 2 stars."
2,"5 Star Music, 1 Star LP","The LP sounds great and it doesn't get any static either. However, there are multiple problems with this package.The disc itself needed a better enclosure. A plastic sleeve with no sturdiness is not good for the LP. The first time I played the disc, there was one skip on each side. Not so bad though. However, after a handful of plays, there was one looped section on side 2.My turntable plays other records just fine.I returned the record for a new one. The first side was perfect. The second side had a skip in it and had a looped section on the exact same part as the first one I received.You have been warned."
4,It's decent... would be 5 stars if the sound quality was better,"I played this on my record player and it has decent sound. Not the best quality sound, but this vinyl disc makes a cool collectible."
3,"Geat music, Poor record","First, this is a great album. The record itself looks beautiful. Maybe it would be great to frame and put on a wall. But audio-wise, it doesn't hold up.First, the packaging is a flimsy plastic sheet. The record came warped. This is probably a huge issue with picture discs. Picture Discs typically have terrible packaging. I have no idea why it cant come with in a study package like formal records. Maybe the package could a little window so one could see the record.The record also becomes scratched very easily. I have hundreds of records, and I take good care of all of them. Nothing happened to this on at all. However, there is a chip side, which causes it to skip. Still, you can listen to it. This record is great for collectors, but not for Audiophiles."
2,Glad I bought this used,"I purchased this book based on recommendations from a forum here on Amazon. I was hoping to read about a hunky alpha male hero and an equally challenging heroine. I was disappointed in the storyline and found the hispanic diction annoying. Without giving away any plot details, I will say that I thought the epilogue was a ridiculous way to wrap up the ending."
1,absolutely the worst Sandra Hill book ever,"I missed this book when it was first released, and now I wish I'd permanently missed it. This is the worst book she's ever written. She had a decent storyline, but the main characters were both totally annoying, and their ""chemistry"" totally non-existent. Rafe is a jerk (without any really good reason) and Helen is an idiot. She's not prissy, she's power-mad. I've read all her other books, and thought maybe it was just an early flaw and they would grow togehter, and read the book through to the end - what a stupid ending! After stretching and stretching and stretching the first 90% of the story, everything just magically resolved itself. no real reason, happy happy joy joy.This book is a complete waste of time. major disappointment, especially considering the much, much better contemporaries and viking time travel books she wrote later."
2,Overall Weak Collection,"ok so most of these films already had a dvd release and in ""Phone call from a stranger"" Bette isnt even the main star at all!. For this collection i would have liked to see ""The catered Affair"" ""Dangerous"" ""Payment On demand"" ""Beyond the forest"" and ""Winter Meeting"""
3,DON'T LOOK FOR JOAN CRAWFORD!,"My title refers to the fact that the Joan Crawford ""Hush,Hush Sweet Charlotte footage is absent despite one poster claiming that there was more than ten minutes included.There are quite a few production stills of Joan Crawford on the set and in scenes.Since Bette Davis is always worth watching, the set is worth having. If you are buying it (as I did) mainly for Crawford footage; there a'int any!!!"
3,Print Quality,"The films selected for this set are, by and large, satisfactory. The Nanny could have been omitted, or better yet, included in another set for those who like her most recent films. Chief among the criticisms which could be made of this collection is the print quality of All About Eve. It is extremely distracting and,on a personal note, I an not very sensitive to these issues. Cannot recommend this collection."
2,What a disappointment.........,"As far as I'm concerned Bette Davis can do no wrong;however, whoever put this compilation together took advantage of my love for Bette. All about Eve and Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte were excellent movies, but they boxed them with 3 duds. The Nanny was horrible. Bette isn't hardly in Phone Call from a Stranger, and I haven't had the stomach to watch the Virgin Queen. Save yourself some money and watch All About Eve on TCM and buy the individual DVD for Hush Hush."
3,Track 10 Ruins My Day,"Don't let anyone tell you that this CD will ""blow your mind"", because I was expecting something earth-shattering and was disappointed to find that the music is actually just an extremely happy, melodic, feel-good collection of choral pop. That, in itself, is a very good thing. But my expectations had been raised much too high, so I was initially let down.Having said that, you will have a big smile on your face while listening to these trippy-hippy run-around-in-the-sun sing-along songs.And then it will all come crashing down with the last track. It's like the group wanted to say, ""Hey, now that you are all happy and relaxed, BAM! Welcome back to reality..."""
1,where is tripping daisy?,"Please bring back Tripping Daisy! I first thought that the spree might be a good thing but then they showed up on volkswagen commercials and ipod info-mercials. There are just too many people in this band to make it enjoyable. Tripping Daisy had character and the polyphonic spree just make me thing of a cult complete with white robes and plastic smiles. They are getting alot of press in England, but remember the brits love sensationalism. That is not to say the group doesn't have talent, they just need to drop like fifteen members and write some good songs. I hate the MTV2 commercial where they are all dancing through the woods, I change it asap."
3,I'm not so sure...,"I bought the self-released version of this a year or so ago because it was highly recommended by Grandaddy's Jason Lyttle, whose taste in music I assumed I might share. But you really have to be in the right mood for this, or it comes off as really cloying. Some of the instrumentation is beautiful, but the 15-voices-rejoicing-at-once thing often just seems a little forced. I could see this band doing amazing things... but on the merits of this record alone, they haven't yet."
4,Like Richard Simmons on Prozac.,"If you were to take Spock's Beard and the Flaming Lips, and combine how happy and cheerful they are, it would not be even half that of the Polyphonic Spree. This is like a ray of sunshine straight up your...well, where the sun don't shine. If there is happier, more uplifting music in existence, it may very well be lethal to listen to. With its huge choruses, lush melodies, multiple instruments, massive arrangements, and just general hugeness, this is just an overwhelmingly elating experience. In fact, it's almost too happy. Let that be a warning to you, if you aren't the most positive or ""sunny side up"" person in the world. I like it though.Plus, Tim DeLaughter, the main singer, was in Tripping Daisy, the band that did that ""I've got a girl who wears cool shoes"" song, or however it went. Remember them?"
4,There's nothing wrong with wanting to be happy...,"The Polyphonic Spree is the perfect band for those days when you hate everyone and just want to go home and sit in a corner. The sound is uplifting and blissful. I definetly think they have huge potential, but they could have utilized their immense numbers better (how about some harmony?). Also, the songs all kind of sound the same after a while, but I will let it slide this time. This is most definetly a band to keep an eye on.As for track 10, well, I think you already know.BUT GOD DAMN IT THEY ARE GOOD. See them live as much as you can!!! It's the most awsome sight; 40 people on stage and all of them overjoyed to be there with you."
3,Last track is 36 minutes of manure,"First things first. This album has some bright spots and is worth checking out. While the PS's sound is more simple and, sometimes trite, than the great Flaming Lips -- singer Tim DeLaughter does sound a lot like Wayne Coyne. But the album has a major flaw. For some reason, the last half hour of this album is nothing but a flat buzzing sound that's about as melodious as a garbage disposal. It's a buzz kill for the listener, and the band should be flogged for its hubris of thinking anyone would find it listenable."
