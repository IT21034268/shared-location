4,Be wary,"My advice would be that the buyer be wary of the ""one-step"" or ""quick-step"" purchase arrangement on Amazon. By error and because the price was attractive I had agreed to purchase the item before I realized that it was only 30 tea bags per box rather than my usual 60 per box. And then to top it off I was notified that the delivery would be delayed for a number of weeks. Fortunately that was rectified, but I would be cautious about where I purchase."
1,cheap painted glass with rusting 'copper' pipe,It looks nice but...- the feeding pipes are made from metal and appear to be copper but start to rust and seem to oxidize from the inside (i.e. when cleaning I get a lot of dark brown dirt out of them) - I wouldn't want to drink from it myself.- the rubber part smells awful (like a car tire) and I am not sure if any chemicals get released into the water- the glass is just painted red and the paint comes off if scrubbed- the dripping seems to be much worse than my previous glass feederI had a red glass feeder before which worked better. The feeding pipe looks like the product photo here (transparent single plastic pipe with a red rubber cap). So I am really disappointed that the photo doesn't show the product and the function is not as promised (as I am probably poisoning the birds).
2,Really cute but...,"The necter drains out slowly no matter what I do. After a few days the existing necter gets rusty??? Not sure it's safe for the birds. It smells like rubber even though I have washed it several times.Unfortunately, it's VERY cute but poorly designed."
3,Not what I Expected,The size of the feeder was a lot smaller than I had hoped. Other than that I like it
5,nice gift,bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and its very nice quality and really neat in the cherry design. fairly large and easy to fill. not much else to say about a hummingbird feeder.
1,THIS GAME IS NOT OUT YET - DO NOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS!,"I don't understand how people can review a game that has no been released and will not be released for two months! All these reviews are, is Everquest fanboys giving a glowing recommendation of a game they are just guessing will be good. Check out Dark Age of Camelot. It is already out and people are giving it stellar reviews. Don't waste your time reading reviews (really previews based on a few screen shots and some info put out by Verant) on the game until it comes out."
3,"Well, Duh","If you sit there and play the game day in and day out, then yeah, it is addicting. Thats not 'EQ's fault you can't regulatre yourself. If you can't restrict yourself to so many hours a week, or something, or can't prioritize things above the game, then don't play it. I think it is a fun game, it's definetly a different type of game, you have to make a schedule some days for quests, or spawns and stuff, but, thats up to you to set the days you want to play, and days to 'LIVE'.I think the new expansion should be worth buying though."
3,everquest rocks,everquest its self is a good game but this is its worst expansion. the add ons for instance the new charcter looks and spells are nice. but the luclin is the worst place it can be dark for weeks and weeks. monsters there are all undercons. so its very dangous. and anless u have a nice computer the lag is annoying so i stick to the rest of everquest.
2,Dont Play This Game....,"This game is ok but very dull. I wish people would stop palying it for a moment and look at a surperior game. The game I'm talking about is Lineage... Its fun, creative and a heck of a lot better than Everquest ever will be. Go (...) see for yourself. Everquest invloves alot of waiting around while Lineage is a perfect blend of wainting and combat. Lineage has a friendly community. (...)So thsi is alot better than Everquest why not give it a shot? (...)"
3,Time management required,"I have spent 2+ years playing EQ. Everquest is very entertaining and fun to play. But you must learn to manage your time well. It is far too easy to be wrapped up completely in EQ. I should know; I was one of those people who played 6+ hours of EQ each day.The people you interact with in EQ are the main attraction to this game. The ability to interact with others makes this game so addicting. You create friendships and share adventures together. But it is also the people who plays this game that will drive you away from EQ with the never-ending greed for upgrade of items for your characters. Guild politics gets out of hand with too many egos that strives for a imaginary sense of respect within the guild.There are many good people that plays EQ but it is the group of ""bad apples"" that leaves a bad taste in your mouth."
1,Worst customer service EVER!,"Just wanted to add a note that Sony / Verant does not care about their customers. For the last year they have had multiple incompatibilies with Windows 2000 which was shown as a supported OS on the last addon for Everquest. They will not even acknowledge the problem much less fix it. I have gotten the run around, even bought new hardware on their recommendation (they were quick to blame hardware manufacturers before their own software). None of which resolved the problem.There is a thread on their forum at www.everquest.com which shows a thread of 50+ posts of people having the same problems with Windows 2000, and the ignore it, and close the thread.Its too bad, the game is great, but your product is only as good your people who support it."
3,This by far the best expansion to date hands down.,This is by far best expansions for any lvl 46+ toon.this is must expansion get you 65 still alot zones that are live.Kiteing grps best two zones is Halls Of Honor or Planes Of Valor.Any pet class 55+ will get godly exp in these two kiteing groups all the way lvl 65.This is my favorite expansion to date.
5,Addiction?,"Lets see...if this game wasn't worth a flip, maybe you wouldn't get addicted...with new graphic enhancements and new zones, this expansion will probably be worth the thirty dollars...if you can't afford thirty dollars, you can't afford Everquest anyway and you need to go play your big guns games. Just my opinion"
1,evercrack,"I dont like paying 10 dollars a mounth for a game, but once you start playing it you get addicted. As what i read from revews on this game it will probably be even more addictive than ever. So just dont buy it. You could buy a lot more cool games whith the money. Like get games that you have big guns with free multi player you can enjoy them without haveing to pay 10 dollars a mounth. Pluse there are a bunch of new multi player games coming out that are going to be a lot funnier than EQ."
5,RE: Dont... do... dont... buy it,"I dissagree. This is a sad case, indeed, but it isn't that addictive. Plus, it's an easy addiction to fight. It's not like smoking, or some vile thing like that. It's something you do in your spare time, after your work is done, to unwind a bit an relax. It's fun, and the higher you get, and the more expireienced, the more fun it gets. There are some hard spots, but it's mostly just a fun game to play when you're tired and don't have the energy to do other things. I personally think it's a wonderful game and it was a great addition to my life."
5,You'll Never Sleep Again,"Bringing enhaced graphics new zones and an all new playable race of cat people to Everquest, this will leave the new player and established PC's gobsmacked as one!The only problem with it is the IMMENSE amount of memory needed to run ALL of the detail at maximum but with memory prices so low theres not too much hardship there!Buy it and get blown further into the realm of NorrathYour in their world now!"
3,This Game Ruins marriages and lives,"If you can seperate relality from fanasty and do not have and adicitve personality this game can provide hours of entertainment and fun. I play maybe 8 hours a week with my real life friends and have a good time but, i do not let get in the way of my life.DO NOT start this game until you decide if you can handle it. The key to playing this game is DO NOT MAKE ONLINE friends. Join guilds have fun but do not move into personal friendship with the people on this game. THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. You DO NOT KNOW them. Please treat them like you'd treat a stranger polietly but carefully."
2,Too Many Kids...,"Although the gameplay is pretty decent, I dont recommend this game whatsoever. The addiction is too hard to break, and you will lose all contact with the real world if you play. I wasted 2yrs playing this game. As for my title, it speaks for itself. 80% of the game are aged 15 and under. This makes for having to deal with alot of underage troublemakers, and the problem multiplies 10 fold during summer/any school vacations. I finally broke the addiction and am really looking foward to DaoC."
1,Disgrace,"Everquest is a disgrace to the mmorpg genre. The graphics are years outdated and the gameplay is horrid. If you're interested in a good mmorpg, go for Dark Age of Camelot."
5,great game do not buy it used it wont work,this is an awsome game if you are any kind of a rpg player youll love it. but i worn you dont buy it used it will not work it says right on the box cant be reselled. why once the game is regestered on soe.com it is there forever if you try to reregister it they will think it is a fake or a copy so ya the price looks good but it dont fall for it thnx
4,the best relationship ive ever had,"i have a girl that im crazy about and she lives on the other side of the world. we meet online and play together and it brings us closer to each other. I don't recommend getting this game if your significant other doesn't play. But if they do, well, it can be a very interesting experience! Where else can you get drunk and not get a hang over? wouldn't it be great if we solved all of our world problems on everquest? Alot of my friends from all over the world, my relatives, and people i have known since school play on the same server. It has strengthened alot of my relationships, but I don't neglect the ones that dont play either. Shadows of luclin needs no review. Its going to be a big hit. Something that me and my girl can adventure together without ever bickering or fighting."
3,EverQuest,"Although I obviously do not have this expansion set yet, I have been playing EQ since november of 1999. It is a very addictive but exspensive game. This game owns your life. When I stopped playing I had so much more fun with my life. I went out with my friends just about everyday when I quit this game. I saved a lot of money to. The game itself really isnt that fun when you break it down. What do you do? Sit in one spot waiting for a certain monster to pop up, sometimes for hours and even then it doesnt show up. Then if you are lucky and you spot the critter, you need to be even luckier in order to get some rare item off it. After all this waiting what do you do? You either sell it or keep it, and repeat this painstakig process. I only gave it 3 stars because its addictive"
3,If You Are Into Roleplaying This Game Is A Must,"Sure you have to pay 10 dollars a month to me that is very little payment for the massive worlds that you can play in. Everquest's World of Norrath is just huge with soo many quests monsters spells skills, it's well worth the tiny 10 bucks a month which at the very least most of us can at LEAST make in an hour. But anyways the game is very exiting and lots of teamwork in groups is invovled. With SOL coming out the graphics will be even better and even more will be added. If you like roleplaying games you should give this a try, I did and I luv the game.(Caldiyena 21 Chanter of The Seventh Hammer Server)"
1,CAUTION!,"The description for Shadows of Luclin specifies ""Platform: Windows 95 / 98"" It also indicates a release date of December 4, 2001. Upon checking with Verant regarding Windows XP, the reply was short and to the point: Windows XP is not supported."
1,Ratings,"I find it funny how so many people can rate this expansion and it hasn't even been released yet. Here it is 6 months away and people are writing reviews on it giving it 5 stars.Everquest is the biggest waste of time you could spend on any game. Literally... you will be sitting doing nothing 90% of the time. Not to mention that Verant has the worst customer service/support of any game company I have ever come across.Whatever happened to the good business saying of ""the customer is always right""... Well in Verants opinion ""the customer is always wrong""."
4,true life representation,"This book has accurately protrayed what gang-life is like more so than any other book or movie that I have ever seen. It helps you have an understanding of how and why someone has chosen or been dealt this life, and shows you that there is so much more to the people Leon Bing has protrayed than just a color and a gun. I only wish she had done a follow-up to this book."
2,glorification of gangstas,Members of the Crips and the Bloods speak out in this book. Most of it is inane--the babbling of kids who don't know how tragic and foolish their lives are. It's gets tiresome after a few pages. I did not enjoy this book.
2,Point of reference,"Inspite of all the hype and controversy centering mainly on Leon Bings race and sex, this book is an valuable resource for gang research if for no other reason than it was the vehicle which led to the Monster Kody autobiography. There are many holes in the structure of the book in relation to use of slang but that is understandable considering the author was obviously out of her element with this project. Once again I would suggest reading this title for the early account of Monster Kody who was just emerging from one of his many jail stints. The interview with Kody is far and away the highlight of the book even if the cover photo is a pathetic attempt to portray the danger of a murderous gang member as sexy."
2,This book tells the shattering truth about L.A. gang members,"The book quickly throws you into the streets of gang life a part of america that we normally do not get see. I one who does not like to read alot but, I found this book very enjoying because, it is the shooking truth about street life and the reason I know this is that lived it and got out."
3,"Yes, I Can Sammy Davis Jr. story","I have recently revived my appreciation of Sammy Davis Jr. He had the most incredible voice and was so multi-talented. What a loss to the entertainment world so I couldn't pass up this group of cd's. For the most part the cd's were what I expectd but a few had a ""tinny"" sound like the recording was done without good stereo or there was a bad copying? Other than that I listen to all the songs over and over again."
1,Awful,I have no idea who on Earth ever thought to record this guy. If there is any value to anything he ever did was he was funny with out knowing he was a total clown. I did enjoy laughing out loud at times but for the most part I wanted to poke out my ear drums.
3,Forget this boxed set unless,"you are a hard core fan of Sammy Davis, Jr. Instead, buy either the best of his work or another single that includes your favorite music by this artist. A number of Sammy's recordings in this collection do not sound like the original releases. For example, ""Keep Your Eye on The Sparrow"" (Baretta's Theme) is subpar to what was released for and played on the opening and closing credits of the TV serial, ""Baretta."" However, in contrast to some of the iffy music, the graphics, photos and other materials about Sammy, included with this anthology, are superb. If I were to do it again, it would be to buy a copy of ""The Best of Sammy Davis, Jr."" and save my money by leaving this boxed set on the shelf."
4,Predominately fabulous but occasionally mediocre,"On the really jazzy swing type tunes the arrangements are engaging and the band performances are precise. Sammy's delivery is tremendous on all cuts but unfortunately some of the selections are fairly ordinary. Although i'm a relatively new Sammy Davis fan I have to imagine that there are cuts from other albums that could have been included in this set to make it more outstanding.Sammy is at his best on the most personal cuts such as 'I've got to be me' and 'Once in a lifetime' and my personal favorite 'Mr. Bojangles'. The emotion is palpable. There should have been more of these types of songs included.Irregardless, the set is great and unlike many other collections or greatest hits compilations this one has only served to increase my interest to hear more of Sammy's songs on his numerous recordings.Overall, it's definitely worth the purchase price."
4,Mr. Entertainment NEVER Disappoints!,"From ""Hey There"" to ""Mr. Bojangles"" this boxed set demonstrates all of Sammy's tremendous talent. Finally there is a tribute to do justice to this legendary entertainer. The fourth CD stands out for its live performances, and Sammy's audience interaction sparkles (the imitations on ""Rock-A-Bye Your Baby are a riot!)"
5,The Real Thing,"This album grings back many memories to me. Listening to Issac brought me back to the ""Good Times"" when I lived in Houston. He was a combination cajun, blues, rock cw artist who combined all his talents into music for all to enjoy. It is sad that he left us so early and didn't get the recognition he truly deserved."
1,TOTALLY gross.,"This stuff is garbage!!If you don't believe me, then try them and watch your teeth do all the talking!!1 star."
1,A Little Disappointed,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I was disappointed with the instructions for the projects. Also the quality of the thread is very poor. It makes it very frustrating for a child to stay interested in learning a craft when the thread continually tangles and it's hard to understand the instructions telling what she is supposed to be doing.
2,Peel: The Peru Project - A Surf Odyssey,The movie is so boring me too much even I was slept. I thought they were actors but I was wrong. They talked about surf on the beaches of Peru. Do not buy it.
4,Sequence of fun,"This a fun game for 2 or 4 people to play. Every couple that we have played it with has eventually gone out and bought the game. Six people is doable but very challanging. We have friends that we visit and spend hours, yes six to seven hours at a time playing our 'sanctioned' games. It requires thought and foresightbut can be learned in minutes. ENJOY."
4,Tape for Whiteboard Lines,"The tape I purchased wasGraphic Chart Tape, Blue Glossy 1/16"" x 648"", and I'm using it to make permanent lines on my whiteboard where I have a chart with a lot of numbers. It's strong and is easy to apply. The amount of tape on this role was ample for a 3' x 4' whiteboard with both rows and columns indicated by the tape."
5,Oil board for longevity,"I don't think the other reviewer knew how to care for a wooden cutting board. NEVER soak your wooden board in WATER. To keep a nice wooden board (like this one) from cracking, you need to apply some mineral oil to the board. My husband and I found some cheap mineral oil in our local Wal-Mart, heavily applied the oil so it would soak into the wood, and have enjoyed it with no problems ever since. The oils prevent water, or other watery substances or food substances to soak down into the board; it also prevents the board from cracking or splitting. :)You may have to reapply the oil ever so often...we used ours at our wedding reception, and have only oiled it once, and it still works wonderfully! Very classy board (and sturdy)!"
5,Jerry O'Sullivan is amazing!,"I love this CD--I keep it, and Jerry's previous CD ""Invasion,"" in my CD player at all times. It's hard to pick a favorite tune, because each is so moving and so beautifully played. As a struggling beginner Uilleann piper, Jerry O'Sullivan's amazing talent always inspires me to keep practicing. While I always enjoy tunes with a traditional celtic sound, the jazzy and classical pieces he includes sound incredible on the pipes. WAY TO GO JERRY!!"
2,All Over the Map and Rhythmically Dull,"There are a couple of things wrong here. The first is that the album tries to cover far too much ground. O'Sullivan should just have stuck with an Irish record, whatever that is. The other, more serious problem with this album is that it doesn't swing at all. Not at all! The last thing an Irish record, or at least an Irish-inspired record should be, is rhythmically dull."
1,piece of junk,this is the worst piece of junk i have ever bought it died one week after purchase there website was trash and i wonder if these things are built by chimps and now it is just sitting collecting dust on my self
5,Better than expected,"Being a guy with size 12+ feet, I crossed my fingers hoping that this would fit my shoes. It did and surprisingly even fits my sets of large work boots.Too bad it's made in China, but that wasn't a surprise."
1,Wow...,"is this a bad cd! In all fairness, fans of experimental jazz would probably like this. I'm not one, and I didn't. If you are looking for regular klezmer, or even coherent tunes, this isn't the cd for you."
2,A Mixed Bag,"Three or four of the songs are good. A few of them are more improvisational jazz, which to me sounds like people noodling around with instruments between actual songs. There's some sort of African-American harmony thing, and the last song sounds like the Ventures trying to play Wipe Out in klezmer style. Not worth buying if you're looking for actual klezmer music, and the title and description are misleading at best."
2,Great Book for Younger Readers,This book is a novel but not one for the serious readers of history and historical novels. This is a great book for an adolescent but not for the developed critical thinker and or reader. Thank you.
5,Great novel displaying interesting historical information!,"Blue Wolf was a highly captivating book, and it successfully portrays in novel fashion the life of Genghis Khan. It was definitely a book I could not stop reading, and it sent me on a quest to look for more information on the great Mongol leader."
1,A Thoughtless and Random attempt at compilation,"Admittedly, this album is not trying to document the history of rock. Instead, it's trying to generate some afterglow and some profits from a truly collection of media friendly bands that have shaped MTV over the past 15 years. The problem lies in the execution. Instead of bothering to think about their music selection and choose musical or visual pioneers, they seem to have chosen random tunes out of the first box they came across. This set lacks unity, passion, and most of all, meaning. You're better off finding your old ""mix tapes"" than bothering with this happenstance collection of tunes."
3,This album is okay not great,"This album is okay but is selection of songs are not very good. I wish they had Metallica on the album or Alice In Chains, or Pearl Jam, Offspring on these albums because these four band's are all very good and they made an impact on the music scene during the last fifteen years."
5,beautiful music!,"Anyone who has a flare for celtic music that is captivating and moving at once, this is the CD for you! It's so beautiful, I can sit listening to it for hours and not get tired of it. I've not been a fan of Celtic music for too long, but the music that I have heard on this CD and others has me hooked. This CD provoked a strange look from my uncle, but I find it to be absolutely worth listening to!"
4,A welcome return to alternative Christian rock,"This was the first TVB release I ever bought (and helped lead me to the great Northern Records). The album is darker in tone than the two previous TVB releases. ""Faith And Devotions Of A Satellite Heart"" brought TVB back to the worship album days of ""Chosen"" and ""Strength"" while ""This Is The Moment"" I think is TVB's weakest release-it sounds like your steretypical CCM rock album. ""Drop-dead"" brings back the alternative rock and even adds in a bit of a ""punk-ish"" edge. ""Do You Love Me?"", with its screaming guitar, ""Rewind"" and ""Swan Sea"" are great rock songs that are sure to please the listeners while the final two songs, ""The End Begins"" and ""One Thousand Years"", are slow and yearning in nature. While not as good as the S/T and ""Demonstrates Plastic And Elastic"", ""Drop-dead"" is a solid release by a terrific alternative Christian rock band."
2,You can tell it's her first book,"While the story is interesting, her writing is anything but. It is amateurish at best. Instead of leaving us to learn of the characters by actions and conversations she just tells us. Her imagination is good and I hope she keeps trying but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one."
3,A little on the small side,I bought this product to put on my vanity. When it arrived I thought it was a little smaller and not deep enough as I wanted. It doesn't hold brushes like in the picture because it's not deep enough but it does hold other items so I didn't return it.
3,okay so far,"I was a little disappointed at the size of this product when it arrived, and so was not able to fit everything I needed in it, but it did organize my smaller cosmetics, and now I am just hoping it does not rust from humidity from the shower...does not look like it will."
2,Vanity organizer/tray,"If I had seen this product on the shelf, I wouldn't have bought it. It is too small for anything."
1,Mesh Organizer-SMALL,"I choose a poor rating because I paid WAY to much for a poor product. The product was built well but was EXTREMELY pricey, for little quantity. The sample picture has to be using small bottles and brushes because there is no way this product would be useful for organizing. Really small, I can't even use it. I was extremely disappointed with this product, especially for the price I paid. I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
3,Organizer,This one is just ok for me. Nothing really special or super helpful about this item. It does the job.
1,An altoid would have the same effect,The homeopathic moon drops taste bad and do nothing. At least if it was a mint it would give you fresh breath. This lozenge doesn't help you sleep or give you fresh breath. Do not waste your money on this product. I think homeopathy has more of a placebo effect than anything.
1,READ THE INGREDIENTS!!!!!,"I will agree with other posters that, yes, I got a great nights sleep. However, the next morning I decided to actually read the label.Ingredients:nux vomica 30x THIS IS STRYCHNINEarsenicum album 12x THIS IS ARSENICI'll let whoever is interested in reading the cumulative side effects of ingesting strychnine and arsenic, however small the dosage is, on their own. Everyone should be advised that homeopathic remedies are not regulated by the FDA, and proceed with taking them at their own risk. I, for one, loved the one night of sleep. These tablets are going in the trash, I'm not game for hoping the manufacturer got the dosage right every time."
1,Let's Be Rational,"Before you waste your money on these pills, do a little research. Homeopathy is a belief system like a religion that makes no sense. It says if you dilute something until not a molecule of the substance is left, the ""energy"" of the substance will be retained. Read again...there is not a single molecule of any substances with number or letters next to them in ""Moon Drops"". A 30X of Nux Vomica (also an ingredient in rat poison) means it's been diluted so much you'd have to eat over a billion pills to get a molecule of it. Yup, all those ""ingredients"" with number are not in the box, not a molecule of any of the Latin sounding stuff. The real ingredients are sugar, vanilla, tapioca, etc. Save yourselves some money and buy some candy and pretend it's a ""sleeping pill"". But, hey, if you like people selling you stuff that is diluted beyond belief and calling it a remedy, it's your right to waste your money in ways you see fit."
5,Small Talks on Big Questions (vol.1),This is a great find!!Every Parent in America should be reading this with their children...A great way to establsih family discussion around the most important topic in life!Waiting with anticipation for volume 2.
3,Jus what I expected,"The mat was just what I expected. Bright colors, large and thick. The only downside is that the material is not very durable. It is a blend of carton and plastic. It sticks to the bare skin as if it had glue residue. Nevertheless, it works great for my 10 mo old (although it may not last long)."
2,Play mat,Bought this mat for my 9 month old. Have had it for less than 2 months and it is ripping at the handles. Surprised considering it was over a [...].
3,Not the best quality,The covering doesn't feel very sturdy. I'm wandering how durable or long it's going to last.
3,"Fragile, ok for babies.........",We were a little disappointed. For almost $100 I would have expected it to be more durable. It is only 3 days old and it has a split in the side of the plastic. My kids age 4 and 6 have been using it for gymnasticpractice at home.
5,Good buy,"Does what it's supposed to, one side of wires came frayed while the other side was still super straight. 5 stars."
4,good study guide,Just what is needed for a simple study guide for leading out a discussion with this book.
4,The Jesus I Never Knew,"I purchased this item to see if it would be useful for our adult Christian Formation program. It is as,and we will be using in in the coming year. It is in excellent condition and was received on time."
5,Susan Polls At Her Best!,Susan has put together a wonderful collection of mottos that inspire our spirits and comfort our souls! My ninety year old sister has shared her book with other seasoned citizens at her assisted living residence and wishes to send copies to many of her friends. A small Jewel of an anthology!
4,Kids enjoyed it for the most part,"I had my kids read this book so that they could understand the importance of saving. Not sure if they got it since they were still a bit young, but I'll have them read it again now that they are older. It's a fun story that teaches kids about saving and what happens when you plan ahead."
2,Picture does not match item.,"I am unsure why Amazon would insert a picture that does not match what the actual item looks like. It is the same type as the 8 sided Bialetti, which is not what I wanted. I wanted the item that was pictured. I think it would be in Amazon's best interest to insert an actual picture of the item they are selling."
1,"Plastic Palette Cup is not what I see from the photo :(,","Product DescriptionThese plastic palette cups attach to the side of your flat palette with a clip. Use them to hold liquid mediums. They're made of easy-to-clean plastic, and have screw-on caps.I bought this palette Cups together with the single one, but the one I recieved is a very simple cup that with no cap and no clip! This is the worst thing I ever bought from Amazon. I feel cheated."
1,"Poor quality, holes incorrectly drilled","The assembly is supposed to be simple - put in the side poles, slide the trellis pieces down over the poles, put the top frame over the pole tops. The pilot holes drilled in the trellis for the metal poles are smaller than the poles, with a thin inner ring that the poles are supposed to snap through. When I tried to place the top trellis over the poles, after lining up the metal poles carefully in the center, both holes cracked open and started ripping into the trellis itself. The top frame piece has the holes drilled too close together, so it won't snap down all the way. I guess I'll try to train a vine over the top to cover up the mess."
1,Wait until you see what the test is REALLY like!!!,"I just took the CPC test a few days ago. I did my course work. They did not really go over past tests but I had secured a simulation of one. I purchased this book because I felt sample tests were something I needed to practice. All the anatomy, etc., in this book is too in depth for what is on the test and overdone...look at how the test is setup. The book should be more based on CPT, ICD, HCPCS, real life examples of coding, etc., that you need for the test. I took the tests in the book and scored well on them.... Then comes the REAL test. OH MY GOSH. I found it to be much more difficult than the sample tests in the book or more difficult than any sample questions I had seen anywhere. And don't think that topics will be evenly covered - mine had 5 cath's on it and no spine, for example. The book didn't hurt, but you need to do much more work than just this book if you want to pass the test."
2,women's garden gloves,"I have tiny hands and need small gloves which are hard to find in stores. I ordered these in a small size. They fit, but the cuffs are MUCH too short, it is like trying to pull up pants that are too short . Women's Work gloves are much better, but they also cost more and you can't find them here. Too bad."
5,This book has given me a greater understanding of my history,"This book has given me a greater understanding of my history and consequently myself. I never understood how I could swing from happy to sad in the blink of an eye. This book helped me put together the pieces of my life and understand that I was really reflecting other people's ""stuff"". I also happen to be married to a sensitive person. Whenever I was sad, he was sad. I used to tell him that this compassionate response really didn't help me but only after reading the book did I understand that he couldn't prevent his response any more than I could prevent mine. Many scenarios in my life indicate that I fit the profile in this book. What a blessing. I have recommended it to many friends."
3,Good start - looking for something more.,"I have been doing a lot of research on Empathy and Intuition the past few years and requested this book due to its rating. I seem to show all the signs of being empathic but still can't quite figure out how to determine if I am, in fact, intuitive or just experiencing my own intense feelings.I was looking for more clinical substance and ""How To"", since it is a ""Survival Guide"", than the personal backstory, generic & very brief case studies, and seemingly random & incomplete details about Flower Essences."
2,Kayaks You Can Build... IF.....,"The title of this book implies that you will know how to build a plywood kayak after reading it. However; it only tells you how to proceed after buying a prefabricated kit from one of three suppliers. (One of which was founded by one of the authors)Nowhere does it give you the dimensions you need to start from scratch and build your own. If you have lots of money and don't mind buying a kit, this book is an excellent reference. But for builders on a budget like myself, I don't recommend buying this book."
5,Excellent book for building kayaks.,This book is the most through that i have seen and I have looked at most every kayak book made. It will help anyone wanting to learn stitch and glue methods for kayaks or small boats. GET THIS ONE!
5,What the F@#$,"R Hoover must be English by birth. Too many slow songs? Wow, if that's the only criticism you can fire at this effort by such top shelf musicians, then the bullet went over your head. The talent in this band, and I have seen them 5 times now, is off the scale. I own everything they have put out and met them after shows several times. You can't possibly be a fellow musician, otherwise you could not make a comment like you did. And if you are a musician, you're just jealous. Go listen to Brittany Spears."
2,Too many slow tunes!,"Too many slow tunes and ballads for my taste.There were a few energetic tracks.Glad I got to review this CD,wouldn't buy it."
2,Competent But Run-of-the-Mill,"This is the same sort of run-of-the-mill, unoriginal stuff heard on ""Sunny Spells and Scattered Showers"". The two albums are not only indistinguishable from each other but from those of numerous other bands in the genre such as the Bothy Band (save for the bad guitarist). The same formula is followed: constant, unimaginative, overly repetitive strumming on acoustic guitar; every 3rd or 4th song is mushy schlock; there is a disturbing sameness to all the songs. I will give a two stars because the musicians, other than the guitarist, are very competent; unfortunately, this results in an overly polished, overly rehearsed, overly sterile sounding recording, which fails to generate any excitement whatsoever."
4,Individualized History,"It is useful to fill in the gaps of broad historical sweeps with intimate details of individuals who lived in a given era. Such is the niche filled in this book about Ralph Josselin, a seventeenth century clergyman. Josselin's personal diary served as the primary source of information for this study. MacFarlane explains a point is to be made whether people who kept diaries differed from others. His conclusion is ""the very fact that he (Josselin) kept a diary suggests that he was slightly exceptional"" (p. 11). Josselin was a book man, an avid reader. He wrote ""I made it my aime to learne & lent my minde continually to read historyes."" From a Christian perspective, Josselin wrote of his work ""if the worke bee of God it will prosper, if not it will come to nothing."" This slice of history is helpful in that it gives insight unattainable through any other means. I recommend this book to people seeking to know more about a reflective thinker of the 17th century."
1,Don't buy this item,This can is junk. The auto shut-off spout limits the use of this can. CARB Compliant? Why do the rest of us have to suffer with California EPA rules? The California EAP has taken a good product and turned it into junk. With a little glue and a screw and this will be a good product again.
3,Briggs auto shut off gas can,"I had moderate expectations of this can, having had problems filling my tractor gas tank for several years, but this met all my expectations. After reading the instruction label on the can, and getting the nozzle set up, I put a gallon into my tractor and did not spill a drop! The auto shut off worked perfectly. I am glad I bought this brand instead of some of the others that I have seen complaints about. Good job Briggs.Edit: After about a year of perfect function, the nozzle fell apart, and I can't get it to work anymore. I inquired at Briggs for help and all I got was ""you need to buy a new can and nozzle"". I guess publishing a helpful repair instruction for a gas can device would be too liableous in these days of no risk law suits and predatory product lawyers on the loose."
5,Fun and Difficult Game,"I thought this game was going to be easy. It can be very difficult in the kitchen trying to get food, but you can figure out where you should throw the food. The graPHICS WERE pretty good,the gameplay can be fun,and the length of the game is perfect. there are 35 missions in this game. BUY THIS GAME!! IT WLL KEEP YOU BUSY"
1,Violence and language ruin this game.,"What a disappointment. We purchased this game thinking it would be something like Ice Age II, and it most definitely is NOT. There is nothing apart from hitting, beating, blowing things up, and thanks for teaching the kids to us ""damn"" and ""dammit"" ... just what every mother needs...Awful, simply awful."
2,average gun,"this gun is ok, for the beginner, but, if your really interested in a good gun, find something better, because i've owned and used much better. with a .12 gram bb, the shots tend to curve right after about 20 feet.the prive was only ten bucks, but i def. could have found better."
2,ok,"this was a cute body jewelry. I bought a set awhile ago, but a few months after having them they started to tarnis and look like there was rust on them!"
2,not exactly what I thought,"I was a little disappointed with these books. My daughter loves Dora so she will enjoy the books anyway, but I was not happy to see that the books in the set (12 books) were not the same 12 books displayed on the back of the case. I also found that the books teach great lessons as they claim to (ex: ""ck"" blends), but the books don't have solid conclusions/resolutions."
2,NOT leveled readers,"Page one of the short ""o"" sound includes the words ""shopping, ice, raisins, bread."" How are kids who are just learning the short ""o"" sound going to know these words? I was expecting something like ""Dora hops to the box."" I don't know; something with basic sight words and three letter words. I suppose these stories are more interesting as they are, but you'll be reading them to your little developing reader--point to the three letter short ""o"" words and read the rest yourself."
3,Dora the Explorer Phonics,I like 12 book reading program. The books are great for a 1st time reader. However my daughter is 3 and just at the beginning stages of reading. Its a little too advanced for her but because she loves Dora its getting her interested in learning how to read. I can't wait for the day she can read it back to me.
5,Great book for kids!,My son loves this books! The stories are short with magnificent large pictures to make reading experience more fun for kids! I read him different stories each time. Definitely worth buying esp. if your child loves DORA!!
2,Too difficult for beginner readers,"These Dora phonic books are suitable with more advanced reading skills. Beginning readers will have trouble reading them on their own. Book 1 has words such as ""adventures"", and ""spacecraft"". The Clifford phonic books are better for beginner readers."
3,Phonics Box set,"I bought this in the hope of helping teach my 4 year old girl to read. Although the box with all the little books are fun, it is more advanced than I had hoped. I was hoping for less words per page & smaller words. It works for reading to her & selecting a few words to sound out, but you don't get the feeling of accomplishment you would get if she could read the whole page - or even a sentence."
5,Worked Great,Was the least expensive option I could find for this labeler. Hope I can still find them again when I run out !
4,The kids like it,"This movie is completely innane, but my kids love it. I was a little surprised at its G rating--I would save this movie for older children (the villian says ""shut up"" which I think is inappropriate for young children and the tension/violence is a little scary for younger children, etc.) Unfortunately, if your kids see this once, they'll want to see it again and again."
5,The kids loved it!,"And isn't that the point of a movie like this?!? Read and look at the case before you purchase; It clearly shows red and green tinted glasses meaning it is anaglyph! It also states: ""The 3D glasses provided are all you need to enjoy this 3D DVD experience-no other special equipment or TV is required."". Anaglyphic 3D has never been perfect be it at the theater or at home, it's kind of why they've moved away from it with modern 3D techniques; That being said all you have to do is tinker with your picture settings (just like you've always had to do with anaglyph) and you can get a pretty decent ""old school"" 3D effect. Will this replace your 3D Blu-rays? No of course not.I'm not sure what the going rate for this was before but now it can be had for $5 in the bargain bins at Wal-mart so you really can't go wrong!P.S. The film is also presented in 2D so it isn't like it is a total waste to just buy this version whether the 3D wows you or not!"
5,Makes 4 yr old son very happy,"After renting this movie from the video store 3 times for our son, we decided it made sense to own it so he could have it available all the time. He loves this show. Still watches a lot even after 2 months. Definately worth it."
5,This woman is hilarious!,"Stephanie Pearl-McPhee is not only a talented knitter but a gifted writer as well. I have 4 of her books and want to get them all eventually. It's great to have a knitter I can relate to. She has a super way of expressing herself. This is a gem of a book, and I recommend it, yes I do! Get it for yourself or for a friend who knits. I first read one of her books from the public library, then I was hooked. I usually read them in bed while my husband's sleeping, trying not to wake him, while I'm snickering away. I've even read parts of her books to him. After living with me (a knitter) for so long, he gets her humor too. Wonderful book."
2,A Little Boring,"This book bored me. To me it was one of those ""time to write another book"" books. I've read two of her other books and a lot of the same exact words appear in the this book. Not cool with me."
5,Great Girlfriend Gift!,"I spent a few hours on a lazy weekend reading this delightful book of observations on life through the eyes of a knitter, then ordered it to give to several of my friends who knit. Laughed out loud many times. It is witty and irreverant, and you do not have to be a maniac with the needles to ""get"" it. Wonderful gift that is sure to brighten the day of anyone who picks it up for even a moment ... though I warn you, it is addictive!"
3,"So much knitting, so little time!","Less complicated, it appears, than other book. Wonderful pictures of garments. I look forward to knitting many of these projects. I would recommend it to those looking for additions to their wardrobe, for those with stash in small amounts and some superlative gift works. So much knitting, so little time!"
5,Singular wit,"As a longtime fan of the Yarn Harlot, I expected to like this book. Stephanie Pearl-McPhee's self-deprecating humor reminds me that knitting is a craft, an art, a hobby, an obsession...and always funny, even if it stops being fun for a minute.It's true -- every knitter needs a copy of this book."
2,THIS ALBUM IS FAR FROM DO OR DIES BEST,THIS ALBUM IS A DISAPPOITMENT DO OR DIE SEEMS LIKE THEY RUSHED TOO FAST ON THIS ALBUM I LOVE DO OR DIE BUT THIS WAS REALLY SOFT
5,They're Back,"Do or Die, Hasen't been gone for the past couple of years, but the past 2 years, the albums were far from the classics. But Get That Paper; is back to square one, using classic beats, and bring that hook back to the orginal.from 24-36-24, to Some Paper and down to I wanna be feat. Bun B. This cd is a front to back. Weather your on a road trip, or just cruzin the block, Get That Paper is one that you can't go wrong on!"
3,ATD Customer Service...,"This ATD Company is hard to get info from !! All I wanted is the Specs for the Spray gun #6925, But this was to much to ask for! I hope the quality of the product is better than the service I've received.5/11/12: the spray gun is a lower quality gun that performs much like a hobby spray gun. For the price it is worth it. It seems to copy much of the Devilbiss design, which is why the gun works well for a low-end gun. This gun works best for clearcoat in the 1.4 size. Primer in the 1.7-2.3 size."
3,Limited uses for pillow,"The pillow is generally as advertised. It should be strongly advised to the consumer that this pillow cannot be used well on a bed without making some provision for breathing. A spacer of some sort is needed if this is not used on a massage table type device with a hole for breathing. The pillow cover does have velcro sewn into it, but it included no velcro to mate it with, so the pillow opening can widen and leave your face falling through. The pillow advertising just needs more information for the public."
2,Too cumbersome,"This face cradle pillow would be much better if it were less bulky. It's soft and squishy, but too thick for a good massage pillow. It's hard to find a case to fit it and it feels a bit claustrophobic during use."
2,Just awful!,"Ugh... what a piece of crap. Worst face cradle cushion I have ever used... so incredibly uncomfortable. I was going to send it back and would have only given it one star until I realized it's a great pillow for side-lying. Unless you need a really thick side-lying pillow with an ear hole, don't buy this thing."
4,Very good but not sherpa covered,"IT IS much more comfortable than a regular cradle pillow that comes with the massage table. I expected sherpa though which would make it even softer and there will be less wrinkles on the faces of my patients. The cover is removable and washable which is a big plus, but still need some kind of cover for sanitary purposes. The flannel covers fit perfectly, disposableCustom Craftworks Sani-Cover Disposable Fitted Face Rest Covers (Box of 50-Count)don't fit, way too small for this cradle pillow."
4,Nice pillow but shape limits functionality,"This is a very nice and exceptionally soft face pillow. I bought it to use on a massage table but I found that the shape does not fit my face very well. I have a long, thin face. The pillow is designed for someone with a small, round face. I'm disappointed because I think this pillow would have been excellent if it's design allowed it to fit my face. I would buy it again if they offered another, more compatible, shape."
3,not even softer,"It's not as wide or as long as my massage table. It's actually not even softer than my massage table, so it's sort of defeats the purpose of having it, but it does add a nice bit of bulk to the top of the table."
3,strong odor persists,"strong odor persists, other than that, great, just right support and thickness. can be used in front of regular mattrass on bed"
1,Not how it's pictured,"Almost 20 years in the bodywork field including being a Certified Advanced Rolfer and this is the worst face pillow I've experienced.It's not shaped for comfort, unless your face is 5 inched in diameter a perfectly round.Do not buy.A sub-quality product."
3,It does mostly what it says it does but....,"I had a drooler who drooled all over this thing. And since there's no plastic covering, doesn't easily wipe clean and has to be thrown in the wash. And the center hole is snug for many clients. They told me they had trouble breathing, hence the drooling having to have mouth open. It looks comfy and squishy, but is actually a bit cumbersome. I don't recommend this for MT's."
2,Not practical for massage.,I chose this product because of price. It was half the cost of the memory foam face cradle sold on massage warehouse so I thought I'd try it. Problem is that it too hard and the shape is wrong for the face. It puts pressure on it. I will be returning it.
4,Comfortable but a Bit Overpriced,"This unit is a comfortable upgrade from the standard face cushion. The quality seems good, and it came promptly. I don't know why the amazon photo of this product has a black glossy face cushion along side the off-white one, because there is no black option and a black glossy cover is not included."
1,"Doesn't work, at all.","I bought this piece of junk at Walmart for 10 bucks. It gave positives for 2 spots in the wall that had no stud, and negative for 2 spots that had a stud. Flipping a coin would be a more accurate method than this thing."
1,Not worth the effort,"Bought this as a replacement after my old unit got ""lost"". The Stanley 77-110 IntelliSensor is not very intelligent! Very unreliable at locatating studs behind 1/2"" drywall."
4,Definitely disagree with other reviews.,"Not sure where the discrepancy comes from with this unit, but I've had mine for a year or so now and has come in handy many times. I can attest every feature works on it.The AC feature works perfectly too, as I can track a wire from an outlet all the way around the room no problem. It occasionally sounds a false positive but a quick second scan and clicking the button again resets and I can figure out what's real.Honestly it takes a little figuring out and that's why I didn't give it a 5. But I love it and would definitely buy it again being so cheap.Also note that the top center of the unit is where the stud is being detected."
1,Disappointing,"This device works fine on some occasions and not at all on others. For example, I just put in a fresh 9-volt battery, which in itself is a challenge, and followed the instructions for calibration. Turns out, I've got a stud in my garage that's approximately 3-feet 3 inches wide! On an earlier project, the device worked as advertised--no problems. On a second project, I continued to get weird readings--like studs that are 6 inches apart--NOT! I'm done with it."
1,waste of money,I am kicking myself for not reading the reviews here before going out and buying this piece of garbage. What was I thinking?According to this device my entire wall is lined with studs the way this damn thing keeps beeping all the time. Stay away. And always read Amazon reviews before buying.
1,garbage,"every wall in my house is 100% stud according to this thing. it did however, earn its one star since my 10 month old loves playing with it."
1,This 'Intellisensor' cannot even self-calibrate itself - Stanley's arrogance in continuing to market this brick is astounding,"Years ago before I started checking reviews on Amazon regardless of where I eventually buy, I bought this ""thing"". This item may very well rank as the very worst of all electronics I have encountered, not because its malfunction is itself unique but because, when it malfunctions it happily announces its uselessness by continuing to ring incessantly to drive home the fact. Stanley Tools should be ashamed of itself for continuing to produce and market this unit.Are there such things as 'minus' stars? No? Too bad."
1,Should have done research,"I usually research my purchases and try to stick with well reviewed items. I wish I would have seen these reviews.Like most people say, this thing will detect a stud 1 moment, then miss it the next. Also, it'll incorrectly detect a stud 1 moment, and correctly not detect it the next.If I were to mark on my walls to trace all the studs and angles this thing detects I'd have spider web designs all over the house. Don't waste you money."
1,Works better as a hammer.,"I was standing in front of the stud finders at lowes wondering why this was marked down to $5.00. After about 15 seconds at home I realized why. I can not tell you how many holes I have in the ceiling and wall of my garage. The stud finder thinks I have a stud every four inches. If you are dumb enough to buy this, as I was, be sure to take the battery out before you throw it away."
2,"Purchasing this product would be a waste of money, unless you find value in purchasing products that do absolutely jack squat...","I don't have much time to go into detail, but this product simply did not succeed at the task of finding any stud, let alone the one for which I was hunting."
1,total rubbish,"Brought this as we moved into a new house and needed to put up shelves/curtains etc as there were none. Apparently there are wires in almost every inch of the wall tested. The AC alarm especially bleeps almost ALL the time, and when it stops, it never stops in the same place. Very confusing. Rubbish instructions, and not worth the money. I brought it because I thought that Stanley was reliable, but sadly, this has not been my experience this time."
1,Junk,"I've had this thing for years and no single tool has ever given me as many headaches as this.It will ""find"" a stud and continue ""finding it"" for the next 36""... I doubt my house was constructed with 36"" wide boards.I cannot even begin to tell you how many nail holes I have had to patch because this thing told me there was a stud where there was nothing."
1,useless,"Yeap, this thing sucks. I only bought it because I thought I'd lost my Zircon. The Stanley beeps constantly when I drag it across any of my lightly textured walls and has about a 25% success rate of finding studs. Fortunately I found my Zircon, which has worked very well for about the past 8 years. But I wasted my money on this Stanley thing."
5,A nice guide to review any dental instrument,"This guide is more complete than an Atlas, because you get a complete information and very good image. It's usefull"
5,review,Handy book. Helps me review. Very Complete. Highly recommend to everybody going into dental assistant classes. Great study guide for me to bring wherever I go so I can get a quick review. Also good before tests.
5,SAT1600,"My PSAT score was 910; by using this book I was able to get to 1470 in two tries. What I thought was really good was that all the questions were challenging, no baby questions.I also like the approach they used of asking a question, and then giving the answer and a detailed explanation on the same page- you didn't have to go to the back of the book.Also, the explanations were thorough, you didn't have to constantly fill in steps for yourself.I had tried Barrons, Gruber,Kaplan, and Princeton Review, and they were alright, but Dr. Fikar's book was amazing.I highly recommend it, it was really worth it for me."
3,Too small to be of any use,"This jewelry box is just way too small to be of any use. I was able to fit (nicely, not crammed) three larger earrings in the top drawer, four necklaces in the second drawer and three necklaces and a ring in the third drawer. This jewelry box has the same dimensions as another jewelry box that I had purchased from another brand, but the acrylic is so thick on this one that the drawers have very diminished space. The box is thick and sturdy, and pretty. I like that it is clear. I just don't have any good use for it, so it will go back and my search for the perfect jewelry box will continue..."
4,acrylic jewelry box,i bought this product because it matched my earring and necklace holder and I needed something for my rings. It works very well.
5,My first Celtic CD,I purchased this CD based on the above review and am very pleased.This is an excellent way to review a spectrum of musicians and styles and I intend to purchase Volume 1.
3,It works....eh,"I was very excited to buy this item, as it was a good deal less expensive than its counterparts.In the end, you get what you pay for. The system is nice - I particularly like the jointed attachment piece because it makes the device easier to place. And there are no complaints as to function. The Dell Digital Jukebox works well, there is rarely and radio interference. So far so good.My problem with this product is sound quality. I have to turn my jukebox up to nearly maximum volume, and then I have to do the same with my car stereo (not as high, but much higher than normal). The volume control is a serious drawback in my opinion, especially when the CD you copied songs from is of a poorer quality. Then you have to turn the radio up even higher, and there is a dead, static-like sound behind the music.I rate this product as a three star - it works, parts of it are useful, but sound quality is poor."
5,TINTNER AND NO ONE ELSE,This Performace of the Bruckner 9th is Certainly th best performance so it have all the music of the 9th ;an Extra work for Tintner more beautiful than Jochum ;Solti;Giulini but we have a little problem with the sound recording it's Good for the Naxos but it's not like the DG or Decca with this miraculos recording sound and because of the wonderful price of the CD this A Super Recommended One!
2,I'm Not Impressed,"Georg Tintner may be regarded as a great Bruckner conductor, but I fail to see this, especially regarding this performance of the 9th. Most of the Tintner discs are plagued by mediocre performances from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. This performance of the 9th pales in comparison to those of Wand, Guilini, Jochum, Chailly, Barenboim, and Karajan.One thing that I noticed was the sloppiness of the ""Scherzo"" movement. This orchestra cannot handle this aggressive movement and they also play it too fast ---- this isn't a race. Poor playing from the RSNO.My advice is skip this one and seek other performances."
5,Surprisingly Great Collection,"These types of collections are usually good for a few songs that one might then tape or re-burn on another CD. But based on a tip from a review, I bought this one, and it's suprisingly excellent -- like getting a superb party tape of (mostly) '90s R&B from a DJ friend. Pretty high quality throughout, and even the songs that got played to death on radio (Never Gonna Get It, Been Around the World, etc) sound good mixed with other lower key (but excellent) songs from Brandy, Aaliyah, Jodeci, Blackstreet, etc. A couple of songs seem out of place or don't fit (Tina Turner's What's Love Got To Do With It, Brian McKnight's ballad), but overall great stuff, ending with Boyz II Men's killer ""End of the Road""."
5,Great Mix from the history of R&B,"This CD is awesome. The songs range from 1984 to 1998, and it brings out the best in R&B. From Boyz II men's""End of the road"", and R.Kelly's ""Bump n'grind"" this CD is great. Also ""Anytime""""This is how we do it"", and ""No Diggity"" are real good."
3,Not as great as it could be,"I have other Butterfly Meadow items (bowls of different sizes), and they seem to be thinner, more delicate and more elegant than this dish. I will keep this dish though it seems heavier because it's still nice, and I'm sure it will be useful -- but it is not as dainty as the bowls, and it's a disappointment.The other complaint I have is the same as I have with Butterfly Meadow plates (which is why I'm not buying them) -- the pretty pictures of flowers and butterflies are in the middle (in the bottom) so they get covered by food. It makes no sense. The designer wasn't thinking straight. For this dish to be truly beautiful, some ornamentation on the inside of the rim i s needed, so it would be visible when the dish is being used (there is some ornamentation on the outside of the rim, but you can hardly see it when the plate sits on the table)."
1,very annoying,"I ordered 3 plates because there was written 3 price for 4. So I expected 4 plates.But after I purchased,I only 3 received and webpage is changed, I can't find the phrase anymore. I live in Korea. We have tax free under approximately $130 including ship and tax. I have to pay the tax, and even the price down to $27(was $30). I need explanation. I think it is a fake. Very annoying"
4,Easy to understand construction of orgone devices,"This slim volume presents a fairly straightforward explanation of what ""orgone theory"" is, and provides easy-to-understand construction directions. Skeptic and shaman alike will find simple projects to try for themselves. Would make an ideal science fair project!"
4,Here's something you Can build!,"This book has loads of info and a straightfoward on how to build an accumulator for yourself. Not really complicated, if you can do ""crafts"" you can do this!"
4,worth renting,it's not as good as chopper town or chopper town vault but worth renting if your into custom bobbers. thanks.
5,Great Documentary,I've watched this 4 times now. Love it. Seeing the bike at the end is just amazing. This gave me a bunch of ideas for my bike... loved the curved rear fender struts.
5,Amazing Single,"I bought this single a week ago before it became available in 8 weeks and I've just received it. And l loved it! It has a very great remix, and the video is amazing, it makes me cry everytime I see it. The presentation is also cool it comes in a slim case with Back to school stickers. I first thought they all were from Lindsay ut it's only one from her, the others are from Sugababes (who are they??) and daddy yankee!!!!!!!! oh my God he's the worst ""singer"" l've ever heard, his songs, at least here in Mexico, are over rated, over played, and they sucks. Also the rythm is the same in all of his songs. Well but he's not worth of a writing also.Returning, this is a very worth buy and a must have for her fans. Dont hesitate and buy it!"
5,Collectable Single,"Firstly, what can you say about the power of this song to begin with. It will take it's place as a strong effort about something in life that needs to be explored this directly in music. The remix of this track is the first actually great remix I've heard of a Lindsay Lohan song.Five stars for the remix alone. Having the very potent video on here is also part of this being a must to collect. ""My innocence"" is a strong additional track. All in all a gem of a single. Once again the Australians show how innovative they are in the arena of cd singles."
2,mmmm??,"The first 4 tracks are similar to the MACHINE AGE VOODOO material and only the first 3 are really worth listening to. The rest are either hard work or simply a cacophony but suitably weird as you would expect from SPK. The raw, original METAL DANCE and METAL FIELD are what I remember SPK for, not this I'm afraid."
5,One of my favorites,"This CD has provided me hours of listening enjoyment. Although the first few tracks are nothing to shout about, all the tracks are very original. Trance/moody."
4,"good quality,just dose not fit well","I order this for my 2011 ranger sport,but they just don't fit well.They seem to be to wade for the floor pan.The amazon guide say the fit,but the produduct decerption says it dose not fit vehicles wite vinyl floors.I haven't sean a 2011 ranger with carpet.Ther should be a fitment note stating that this product dose not fit vinyl floors."
3,One detail left out of description,Love the sign...disappointed that there was no mention in the product details of the fact that the graphic contains lead paint. I chose to keep the sign anyway but kept it sealed in its plastic wrapping.
2,Awfull music,"Though the information was intriguing the background music made it the worse DVD I have ever watched. Very very poor choice of music, disruptive to the point I did not want to watch anymore. Waste of money, any chance I can get my money back?"
1,Video editing makes me seasick,"I was really eager to see this video, and very interested in the subject matter. But, the video editing makes me seasick, and ultimately, I had to turn it off. Nearly every scene consists of two or more images that are superimposed, and swirling or moving in opposite directions. All the other video effects are over-used, too; like someone who went crazy with Adobe Photoshop. Too bad; I think that the author may have had some good content, but if he ever makes another video, he needs to get a competent and qualified editor to do the post-production work."
1,"Thin, incomplete and a total waste of money.","Philip Gardiner is obviously an intelligent man with loads of knowledge on esoterics, cults and religions of the world. Why he would produce such an annoying amateur production is as much of a mystery to me as these serpent cults. He presents tons of similiarities between religious icons from Osiris to Krishna to Christ and Zoroaster. Those similiarities are obvious to any thinking person and sophmoric as a foundation for this video. Snakes are prehistoric animals which exist on almost every continent. Of course there are snake and dragon myths in many cultures. I'm tired of all this thin conjecture and emphasis on anthropamorphism. What's with the idiotic soundtrack which goes from heavy metal to choir practice without rhyme or reason. The sound quality is sub par, the visuals are pathetic. My final comment THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSucks."
3,Gardiner is consistent,"This movie, although far from the quality we have come to expect is interesting in its own right. It is worth an hour of your time and follows Gardiner's usual rhetoric. Again the information was interesting and informative but slow at times."
1,Poor.,This DVD is a poor representation of stories.Baseseless and without any true substance. Apart from the content the quality of the picture is sub-standard.
3,Music Lover,"I just bought the Sanctuary expanded import version hoping to relive the LP magic of this great album. Unfortunately the sound quality of the mix was a disapointment. It may be fine for some but I love vinyl and the mobile fidelity and DCC gold digital recordings come close enough for me and I was hoping this one would be somewhere close - it isnt. If anyone can relate to what I am saying and knows of a better recording of UH Live, let me know. Just passing along if anyone is in the same boat i was."
2,Not worty of Masterpiece Theatre,Great classic turned into a melodrama. Give it a miss.Even the scenery isn't worth watching this poor adaptation of a fine book.
1,Aargh,"I understand the urge to tweak things in an a adaptation but I have to say that they seem to have set out to change things gratuitously in this version and to mind it spoils it. It's no longer Robert Louis Stevenson! As other reviewers point out they change many many plot details, even the casting spoils some things (Davie is supposed to be a foot taller than Alan Breck Stewart). The tension between the lowland Whig Davie (the head) and the Highland Alan (the heart) isn't apparent and ultimately in this ""adaptation"" of a ""coming of age"" book by RLS, Davie doesn't grow up in any sense."
1,Good casting. Horrible screenplay.,"If you like Robert Louis Stevenson's book, for the love of God, don't see this movie. PBS chopped this exciting novel into unrecognizable bits of haggis. I can just imagine the writers' conversations now. ""Hey, we have this book that has been in constant publication for 150 years. Stevenson obviously didn't know how to please an audience. Let's use our collective wisdom gained from our other great classic adaptations such as ""Mary Had a Little Clam"" and the dieting infomercial ""How Humpty Lost his Dumpty"" to pull together something that might give PBS a tiny spike in the ratings so it can compete with a Law and Order re-run.""Seriously, this really was a mess. Save your money for something that is a little higher quality, like a Godzilla movie."
2,Tedious,"I found this movie tedious, and none of the characters particularly sympathetic. The young protagonist came across as whiny - more like a spoiled child than any kind of hero, and Alan Breck seemed just reckless. Don't waste your time or money."
3,"CD of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Kidnapped""","Received a CD of Robert Louis Stevenson's""Kidnapped"". Although we ordered the DVD, will not return the CD as too much trouble."
2,Not up to par,"I didn't enjoy this version of the great Robert Louis Stevenson novel as much as some earlier, if more glamorized versions. I found it to be stiff, dark and with the Scottish accents very hard to follow...I'm usually quite good at accents. The persona of the heroic Alan came across as a mixed up character, somewhere between Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks and so stupid that the viewer only wants to give him a good kick! I couldn't advise watching this DVD if you haven't read the book, so just get a copy of the book and have an enjoyable time with it."
3,Strange Interlude,"Don't you love Richard Strauss?! His music is really beautiful. I have always loved the suite from ""Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme"", but that's not why I own this CD. When I get this CD out, I like to listen to the other item, the Intermezzo Interludes. These instrumental bits from one of Strauss's late operas sound immediately like the Strauss of ""Der Rosenkavalier"" and ""Ariadne auf Naxos"", although this music lacks the sheer inspiration of those compositions. It's nice music, though, and if you like Strauss, you will probably enjoy taking this one down off the shelf every now and then as I do. The Australian orchestra plays well. Interestingly, these Interludes feature a prominent obligato piano part in a couple of movements. It works well, and yes, there are waltzes! What more do you need to know?! Buy it!"
1,Don't Buy This Book,This book was the worst LSAT book I used to prepare for the test. It's compact size made it stressful on my eyes and the book was hard to keep open during a practice test. The questions were misleading and sometimes irrelevant. I would estimate my score went down from using this book.
2,Still struggling with the set-up,I have an older V4 Evinrude ('87) and have been struggling to get this set up to read at higher revs. I installed a potentiometer and resistor as recommended on some of the tech/shop pages. It reads fine up to about 3500 rpm (only 2000 without the resistors) and then drops back to zero. The older Evinrudes are notorious for poorly-regulated voltage and I am guessing that the problem is more in my setup rather than a gauge problem.The gauge itself is well-built and the hookup is easy. The instructions are very clear.
2,Deceiving picture,"Picture is deceiving. I was trying to match other Teleflex instruments on my boat and this looked like mine. However, this Tach arrived with a very tinted glass rather than clear. It has a dark tan dile rather than white. It has a black rim rather than a shinny aluminum or dull chrome. The bummer is that I returned it unopened but was charged 20% of cost for restocking fee. So much for Amazon savings!! The Tach itself would probably have served my needs but the deceiving looks of it online is not what it looks like in reality."
5,Great for Reluctant Readers,"This book meets National Standards for 5-8 Human Body Standards. It is great for ALL students at the middle level because it is kid friendly, readable, and has great simple lab activities that add to learning."
1,This software is unusable on mac's and unix systems.,"I bought this software hoping that it would help me to find required mathematical formulas faster. At home on my powermac (OSX.1, OS9.2) I only see messed up windows. Furthermore, the formulas are unreadable, using an archaic font. Trying to save the day, I went to my linux machine at work reading ""Your operating system, Linux 2.2.19-7.0.1, is not supported by this software. It appears that the software is only suitable for some SUN and SGI machines. It only appears to run properly on a windows machine. From an editor, who I remember, is one of the few persons finding errors in Knuth's TeX system, I expected much better."
5,Five Core Metric review,I found this book to be very enlightening. It has presented many concepts that are reasonable and applicable to the work environment that I am in. It has been of great assistance and is well written.
2,Actual Professional,"This book would have been good if written 15 - 30 years ago when all of their examples and references where fresh, but today this is like reading a first grade book on the subject of project management.It is as if the authors never grasped the CTQS triangle, and such of project management. The 5 metrics are so obvious and unmeasureable that it is an exercise in no-kidding, now what.The continual references to the third rock from the sun and such is just page filler.A nice title but no beef here (to have a pharase from the time the authors seem to still be living in).I suggest you find more meaningful books."
5,Epic Achievement,What Mr. Harris accomplished in this series is phenomenal. This is an ultimate and indispensable guide to 3-cushion players. All four books of this series are full of precious formulas and tips many of which have been secret to amateurs. Systematic and pin-pointed explanations and diagrams are incredible.
4,Like a Rolling Stone,"This book is uneven, patchy, which I think goes along with the author's mindset while travelling and perhaps while writing the book. Some entries into this pasrt-travel diary and part-autobiography are better than others. Especially recommended are accounts of his childhood, a bus ride in Nepal, his time in Iran and his trip to the Paris cemetery where Proust and Jim Morrison are buried. I read it while travelling myself in Southeast Asia and perhaps that is its best use, as a companion while abroad."
4,A great add on,Not a complete game in itself this is an addition to Memoir 44.As add ons go this one is very good. It plays differently than the original and isn't just a couple of new scenarios. As always with Days of Wonder production quality is high and pleasing to the eye. The game is fun if a little to random to merit the 5th Star but if you enjoyed the original then I recommend this add on.Enjoy.
2,Complete but disappointing and overpriced,"This is a somewhat dated book, printed in 2000. Given that, it provides a decent overview, but not a lot of depth. When I ordered this book it was not clear that it is out of print, and therefore way overpriced. The information as an overview is worth the original price of $15 listed on the back of the book. But it certainly is NOT worth the $50 it currently sells for. Find another book. Also, the book was sold as new, and appeared so, but upon reading there were already highlights on some pages. Overall, a disappointment and not worth the money."
2,VAN GO GONE,NOT UP TO HIS OTHER EFFORTS. THIS VIEW OF MINE MIGHT BE DUE TO MY JUST RECEIVING HIS LATEST CD WHICH IS THE BEST AND AS GOOD AS THEIR NEW AMERICA CD.
5,Excellent!,"A very strong album from one of the leaders of the 70's rock group America. This album contains some undiscovered treasures. It not only recalls his America roots, but also sounds Beatlesque at times, not surprising considering Beckley worked with Beatles producer Sir George Martin for most of the 70s. Several songs on this album should have been hits including ""Emma"", ""Goodbye Highway"", and ""Kiss of Life"". This is an excellent CD, highly recommended!"
5,Get Van Go Gan!,"Get Van Go Gan! Get smoothness. Get romance. Get humor. Get serious. Get light-as-air. Get a great companion when you're driving along by yourself, figuring out life. Get a new dimension for a loved-one who is not familiar with Gerry Beckley. Get music you'll still love decades from now. Get it?"
4,I picked this one up cold and what a pleasure...,"I wanted some up to date contemporary Brazilian jazz, after becoming weary of the endless stream of Jobim and Sergio Mendesreissues. This disc delivers just that! With an array of artists complementing each song just right. The acoustic charged selections feature talented guitarist Romero Lubambo on Jason Miles arrangements. The tropical feel of the album coversBrazilian moods from bossa to funk, all nicely sequenced for maximum pleasure. Percussion and synthesizers abound! There are guest contributions from Herbie Mann, Gato Barbieri, Michael Brecker and others. Jason Miles formula gives us a good background mood for whatever! Though every aspect of this project is expertly performed, none of thetracks are truly memorable, thus my four star rating."
2,Phil Meets Chanticleer,"Phil Spector meets Chanticleer. Why in the world would a group so musically gifted as Chanticleer not let the words and music speak for themselves? I am sure many who are unfamiliar with Tudor and similar music from the C of E will think this is terrific. For them, listen to the pure simplicity of Men & Boys from St. Pauls, Kings College, etc."
3,What's the Fuss?,"I don't know why everyone is complaining so much about this film. It is what it is, a cheesy, low budget B horror flick, and for what it is it's a fun movie. So don't expect great acting or special effects. If you like B horror and Lovecraft get it. If you want a really good Lovecraftian movie that's true to Lovecraft's vision (within budget restrictions ;P) go get Stuart Gordon's Dagon or Dreams in the Witch House. They're the closest thing to a 'good' Lovecraft movie ever made.P.S. - Hopefully Guillermo Del Toro's At the Mountains of Madness, due to come out 2010, will finally give us a honestly good Lovecraft film."
1,Roberts playing Monk playing Ellington,"I made a mistake and bought this album without first listening to a few tracks. This does not sound like any Ellington I have ever heard. There is too much freedom for the musician to go where the musician wants to go rather, than where Ellington's music would go. You may like the album. As a die-hard stright ahead jazz fan, I don't."
4,Great !!,"This is a Great way to enjoy this very rare japanese TV Shows. This is my first download and the Quality is very Good ( and I talking about 1967 TV Show !!) Johnyy Sokko and his Flying Robot ( also Know in all latinamerica like ""ROBOT GIGANTE"" ) , One of the big japanese Sience Fiction shows of the 60,s. ( Like Ultra Man , Space Giants and Ms. Comet ). In this version of Johnny Sokko you can see it in Full color ( Its no Black and White like the promo Picture Displayed in this first episode ).Dont expect good special efects, as you see, this is a very old show. ( I saw it when i was a Kid ). I give 4 Stars because they really rescue the showand was one of my favorites a Looong time ago !! Good Job Guys !!Sorry for my bad English but Im Trying my Best"
4,Old school tv kaiju,"This is an old show so the picture quality is grainy at best. That aside, the fact that its available is awesome. This is along the lines of the first ultra man or space giants. This show appeals to the Godzilla fans. A kid, a giant robot friend, monsters to fight.... This is boy fantasy. I can't wait to have my boy watch it."
1,This is a Very Poor CD Set !,"The expensive ""Where The Faces Shine"" CD set is truly unacceptable.It sounds as if it was recorded using a circa 1970's personal cassette recorder by a common concert-goer at several of Iggy's early concerts.You can trust me on avoiding this offering!I will return my order to Amazon in a few days."
4,Should be on every manager&#65533;s desk and well worn!,"There's an old song that has a line: It's so easy to fall in love... it's so easy, it's so easy. It's a shame that managers around the world seem incapable of singing: It's so easy to say thank you; it's so easy to say, good job! It's so easy, it's so easy.Pat and Joan hit the soft spot again. In our false Puritanical and strong silent type corporate culture, the hardest thing to get them to do sincerely, should be the easiest and natural thing to do. So read this book and be reminded that good leadership and management begins with the basics of civil and human behavior. And if you still find it doesn't fit well with your strong silent type suit you wear at work, try the Navy and Marine short but emotion filled way of saying thanks and good job: Well done, Jones, well done... keep it up! See that's not so hard is it? You would even smile if your boss said that to you wouldn't you? Ned Hamson"
2,Good Quality But...,This is a good quality sun shade but it is not custom fit for my car as it should have been. It is 6 inches to long and 3 inches to high and has to be forced fit to work. The only reason I kept it is because the competitor's were an even worse fit. I just have to make due with this because it is terribly hot here in Miami and I need something to keep my car cool.
4,Smart and entertaining,"The Last Campaign is a well-written and lively romp through the history of the 1948 campaign. Although I was not completely convinced by Karabell's argument that television is responsible for the increasing blandness of our presidential campaigns, his vivid portraits of Truman, Dewey, Wallace, and Thurmond do provide a striking contrast with the bland Bush and Gore. This is a book that entertains while it also makes you think."
2,Not quite the whole story,"Wrting the history of an ancient event---and the 1948 presidential election is an ancient event---leaves you at the mercy of the written word since nearly all of the major players are gone. And that written word can be treacherous when it is not downright misleading. Dr. Karabell depends, as all historians must, on printed or Oral History accounts of the events he reports...and those reports are often self serving when they aren't downright false. Dr. Karabell does a workmanlike job in describing the 1948 campaign but the small errors that keeep popping up are annoying (James Reston was not a columnist for the New York Times in 1948 nor was Thomas Dewey a US Attorney in New York) and makes one wonder about the larger facts."
3,Author goes overboard re: Truman,"Overall, I thought this was an interesting read. However, I think the author went overboard in his criticism of Truman for bringing down the level of discourse. If Truman went on the attack, this was certainly not unique to American politics. Long before Truman, politicians publicly accused each other of being syphilitic [...]. And wasn't it just a few years before the 1948 election that FDR's opponents accused him of sending a destroyer to retrieve his dog? So I think that in his conclusion, the author goes too far in his accusations that Truman's attack crossed over some implicit line that politicians were not supposed to cross.This book came out before the 2004 election and this year's election, both of which are nothing to be proud of, so today's readers would not be particularly shocked by anything Truman said.Otherwise, recommended."
2,an oft-told--and disappointing--tale,"This is a rather shallow interpretation of both the 1948 campaign and our current political plight. The author offers little new information or insights. In fact, I was so surprised that, according to the brief quotation on this site, the New York Times gave it a good review that I looked up the review in its entirety. The reviewer wrote that Karabell's ""narrative is more effective than his interpretation"" and that ""Karabell helps to perpetuate a widespread misunderstanding."""
5,sparkling narrative,"This is a marvelous piece of narrative history - with colorful characters, fascinating stories, and evocative anecdotes. It's also a wonderful book to read, with a familiar but compelling cast of characters - Truman, Dewey, Henry Wallace and even Strom Thurmond. It also makes us think about politics today and how they've changed over the past half-century. Zachary Karabell highlights the role of money and television in presidential elections, and he manages to entertain us in the process. More than anything, The Last Campaign carries us briskly along, bringing an earlier era to life."
4,Credible authors trained in public health,"This book is both valuable and timely. It shows how important it is to be prepared in detail at the local level. The book should be read by all those who would be involved in the aftermath of an attack, including EMTs, physicians, police and fire personnel, emergency department personnel, those in local government, local public health agencies, the CDC, and state and federal governments. This book is clearly written with contributions by well qualified experts. It should be on many desktops in every community. It makes clear what needs to be done in order to be prepared for a bioterrorism attack."
2,don't waste your time or money,this album by tanya is extremely mellow and boring. all the songs run together and sound the same. please save your money and time on this waste of an album
4,"Excellent tunes, skip the songs.","The instrumentals are as good as DeDannan has ever been. They have a wonderful lift and swing that makes you want to bounce in your seat. Derek Hickey and Frankie Gavin sound fantastic together! Wow!However, I thought the choice of songs was chintzy and the singing was melodramatic (Though Mr. Flemming DOES have an incredible voice).For those who like sappy Irish songs, buy this album! For those who prefer traditional Irish music, buy this ablum--and be thankful for the invention of the programmable CD-player!(And, regardless of whether you LIKE it or not, one can't help but be impressed with the faithful rendering of Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" done as an Irish trad instrumental! You have to hear it to believe it.)"
4,incredible voice,"tommie fleming's voice is stunningly beautiful. i am eagerly waiting for their next album, however, since de dannan's lineup changes so often, i really hope he will be around for it.note: the band de dannan has changed its name at least once before, it used to be call de danann. if ur not a hardcore irish music lover, i would caution u from buying those. i bought this cd first, and thinking their previous albums would be just as good, i went and bought 3 of the old ones. boy, was i disappointed. hibernian rhapsody is the gem of the group."
2,Buy a more recent version tour book,"I have lived in Guatemala City now for 7 months. I recently spent a couple of weeks in Antigua and found the information in the Rough Guide (2006) about restaurants, cafes and things to see to be out of date and not complete. I saw a review from another person that said the danger warnings were too strong. I am glad that person had a safe trip, but regardless, Guatemala is dangerous. The criminals won't hesitate to shot a person if they resist giving up money or valuables. Don't let that stop you from visiting, as many come here with no problems. Most of the crimes are target of opportunity so be a smart traveler. That said, I found this book to have a good layout."
2,Outdated,"While this was once a very good guide, wait until an updated edition is published before purchasing if you plan to visit the Central Highlands. Hurricane Stan devastated the Lake Atitlan area in late 2005, when this book was ready for publishing. Many of the hotels, restaurants, etc. in that area are no longer in business or have changed ownership."
1,Could I use less than one star?,"More than a 2000s book, it looks like an 80s book. I went to Guatemala city afraid, because he described a war zone. It is irresponsible to publish such information. Maybe he should really travel there instead of watching CNN."
5,Great book to start planning your trip!,"I received the book pretty fast after I ordered it and once I opened it I immediately got excited to go!!It's a book with lots of good and helpfull information, not a lot of pictures but the way they describe everything makes you feel like you're there.I would recommend everyone on buying this book."
1,New edition on the way,"It looks like the third edition (""Rough Guide to Guatemala 3"") will be released January 30, 2006. Unless you're leaving real soon, I would wait for that to be released."
3,it's okay but....,"it would be nice to have more detailed information, such as prices for things and such. seems to be accurate so far, but isn't very detailed. i think i prefer lonely planet's guidebooks."
3,a good read for all ages,"The Key to Space is quite an entertaining book, no matter your age. It's very well written, very descriptive, and is set in a real world place that we can relate to. Older adults might find it a bit slow at first, but it gets into some good sci-fi action in no time, and just keeps building right up to the end. You don't want to set it down, and when you finish you find yourself wanting more."
2,Canon sure shot,This camera is difficult to program. I've called for support and it still doesn't work properly.
3,Was looking for more,"After reading the first review, this sounded like the prefect book to buy. I just got Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and needed a beginner type book. It is set up for beginners, but I think the explanations are too brief. This book is more of an overview of features that a how-to-use book. I returned it. Still looking for something better."
5,a very good book,"i think this book is perfect for beginners, i reallyenjoyed reading it, the author wrote it in a very good \and organized way, the colors make reading more interestingas a beginner i learned very good from it, i was intendingto take a course in adobe photoshop but after readingthe book i am able to work on my own. the book onlylacks giving us several made pictures giving us moreideas than those present in the book"
4,all fine,"i dont have any problem with this camera, really i like this very much i dont find any problem"
2,Had it for 3 days,"Though very impressed with the form factor , dual lens etc, I was very unimpressed with picture quality in low light and indoor conditions.I really wanted to hold on to the camera inspite of the low light quality issues because I liked the form so much. But then happen to compare the image with Canon SD600 and I couldn't justify keeping it.So returned the V570, and placed an order on Amazon for SD600. Waiting for its arrival.Here are the Pros and Cons:PROS1.Stylish Form Factor2.Wide Angle PhotographyCons1.Cannot connect the camera to a PC without that docking cradle2.Even if you connect, the camera memory storage doesn't appear as a drive . Instead you need to run the Kodak software to transfer the image.3.Poor Indoor Image quality."
5,Best Camera we have bought,"We really love this camera. The dual lenses is great to have. It make taking picture inside perfect and works well outside too. Also, low light shots are better than previous models. Highly recommend."
3,Realtors will like it...,"As a realtor, I was very excited about this camera. Even though interior shots for the web and printed brochures don't need to be all that great, the pictures from this camera I consider well below average. Yes, you can get a great wide angle of a room, but if you would like to capture any decent detail, this camera won't do it for you. It will, however, do the job for you and since it's going for around $275 now, I would say it's worth it for realtors ONLY! In the camera's defense, I have taken pictures with my Canon EOS 35mm with a Sigma wide angle lense and interior shots have turned out poorly as well. It's a real challenge to get enough light inside a house to take good wide angle shots."
2,disappointed with amazon,"The features of the camera are great. But, the zoom lenz did not work. Only the wide angle lenz worked. I had to leave for an international trip the day after I received the camera. While I my trip, I could not get the zoom lenz to work. When I returned 3 weeks later, I contacted Kodak customer support. They confirmed the camera was not working. I called Amazon's support contact company. They have a policy that you can not return an item for replacement more than 14 days after purchase. I did not have an opportunity as I was out of the country for 3 weeks after purchase. They refused to take the camera back. Amazon has lost me forever as a customer."
3,Good outdoors and for panoramas,"This is a nice little camera. It takes good pictures outdoors and has a nice backlight setting. Unfortunately, it does not take good pictures indoors. They always come out too dark when I try to use the flash. Color saturation indoors is not good. The best feature about this camera is the movies. They can be as long as you want, don't jiggle, and come out beautifully if you take them outdoors. It is also good for upclose pictures of flowers and wide angle shots of the whole gang. I like it, but will someday need to get a camera that is better indoors."
5,"Double the Lenses, Double the Fun.","Rugged, stylish, dependable, excellent image quality, video capable, panoramic capable, unique! Dropped my first one off a cliff after it had been serving me professionally for over two years. Bought this one to replace it, couldn't be happier. The UW lens is amazing. Anyone shopping for a digital camera should consider this one."
5,Best Camera Ever,"Great camera, particularly for those of us in real estate who need wide angle. Cannot say nicer things about this, best I've ever had."
4,Great Pocket Camera,"Have used this several times now and LOVE the wide angle lens.Stitching of panorama shots is good (better with practice pivoting rather than panning camera)Quality is acceptable for a point and shoot but not as sharp or clear as my Canon DSLR.Battery life is good, start up time is decently quick (~1.5 sec.)Transfer to PC is one touch easy. Many (almost too many) picture modes.Cons: Flash is weak, and low light performance is marginal at best.Overall, good pocket camera for daytime parties, landscape and impulse photography. Superwide angle lens is a huge plus for those situations that warrant it (Real Estate pics, group photos, vacation panoramas).RGUARD"
5,Starring Alison Lohman's Feet,"The best part of the movie is when Alison Lohman is sitting at the table doing homework and has her bare feet propped up on the table, proudly showing off her mildly-house-dusted soles. Her mother comes and pinches her toe and knocks the feet off the table. Oh!!!"
4,Unsung Baroque Master,"Manfredini is one of the unsung masters of the Italian Baroque. This recording is the first commitment of his complete and enchanting Opus 3 to CD. The concertos are energetic and polished and showcase the considerable melodic gifts of this fine composer. The 12th concerto will be familiar to many as the ""Christmas"" concerto which is a fine and beautifully crafted finale to the opus. Let us hope more of Manfredini's music will soon make its way into recordings."
3,yet more concerti grossi,"Nice, well-performed, and all that but really if you've heard one set of concerti grossi from the 1st half of the 18th century then you've heard them all. I challenge anyone to distinguish this CD from the concerti grossi of Corelli, Geminiani, Locatelli, Vivaldi, Handel, or Heinechen. Nice pleasant music but it all sounds the same."
5,Circle Dance,"Circle Dance is a powerful journey about two Greek - American sisters, who return to the United States after vacationing with family in Ikaria, an island in Greece. Carrying with them the values of Greek tradition, each sister encounters different situations that will truly test their values with not only the family but themselves as well. Lynne and Valerie Constantine have created beautiful, strong characters that we as readers can follow along with and come to really care for. Whether Greek or not, Circle Dance is a book that you wont be able to put down until you have read every last page."
1,Disappointment,"I LOVED Cathie Ryan on ""The Soul of Christmas"", but was sorely disappointed with this CD. It sounds very Country, instead of Celtic/Irish, in my opinion. I don't know if I'll purchase any more of her CDs."
4,Nice Big Bag for Large Comforters,This bag does the job. I have a big king size comforter I like to store away in the summer. The bag the comforter came with ripped so I replaced it with this one and so far so good. Seems to be good quality. Zipper is fine. I'd buy another one if needed.
3,Zippered bag,"It is a nice size, perfect for storing the afghan I bought it for. I did find that the zipper wanted to come apart after zipping. (Sometimes this does happen with nylon type zippers.) Also from the description I expected it to be a heavier plastic than it was."
4,Not bad for the price,Good and durable. The pins and the ring are not a bright as I would like but usable in sunlight. Mine came with a empty bubble level. Truglo sent another one out at no cost with no questions. It was easy to replace. It is a good and accurate site at a great price.
1,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed with this product. I have many records that are now scratchy and wanted to replace them with a CD of these originally recorded songs. This collection of Tony Orlando and Dawn Greatest Hits songs (in my opinion) does not sound like the original recordings. I feel this CD is a waste of money, and am dissatisfied with the product and Amazon for selling such a poor product. I would love to return the product, but I do not want to go through the hassle of returning an item to Amazon."
5,tony orlando is great,I did not realize all the hits tony had . My wife told me to order this treasured CD . Great stuff!
1,Pumps great but cheaply made,"The ""pump"" portion of the machine is fantastic, but the cheap screws and plastic used to house it does not survive long. I used this pump every week for a little more than 2 months, whereupon the screw anchor gave way, disengaging the floor of the pump, making the entire machine useless. The words ""Made In China"" are emblazoned on the plastic and though I hate to generalize here is a product that meets the stereotype. In short, if you're going to use it infrequently, it will probably survive, but heavy use is not recommended for this pump."
1,Wayne Water Pump,"They say it's ""Submersible"" but I used it for just one day, and it was under water and the next time I tried to use it,which was the next day it didn't work. Another BIG negative is they say ""Not to Run it Dry"". How in the world are you ever going to use it if you have to stand there and watch it all the time that it's running. If the pump cannot be run dry, they should make it with an auto shut-off similiar to the one on the ""Rule"" pump""."
1,Not dependable,I bought this to replace a VIP25 that stopped working because the cord shorted out after only a year or so of use ..... this one lasted about the same length of time but died a different death ..... not the quality they used to be .....
2,Be very careful.,"I haven't even owned it a 13 months and already it blew the oil out of the motor. I have probably used it about 10 times to pump water out of a dry well and a low point in our sidewalk. It worked most of time, not great but not bad either. I probably let it run dry a few minutes before I came out and unplugged it and there was oil all over the place. I am very disappointed with it."
3,Sump relief,Purchased this for my mother who has water problems in her home after heavy rains. We haven't tested it as of yet as the cyclical deluge hasn't happened. I will update this review after having had the experience of using the product in real time events.
4,basic pump,I got this pump as a back up unit. it is very simple and I hope it is very reliable. great price
2,I was cheated,a hose was recommended for with a coupling that does not fit..i called wayne and they said go buy one at lowes ...gee thanks
1,Pure Chinese junk!,"I have had this since the beginning of July, this is mid-August. Absolute piece of junk made in China. Do not buy it. It is slow removing water from a resavoir I built to hold water that backs up from the street into the basement.It stops constantly. Just a waste of money. Stay far far away from this product!"
1,Do Not buy this Pump,This is the worst pump in the market as per the size of the motor it has.I bought this product because I had to get the water out of my pool.The pool is almost 10 feet deep. This pump was not able to get the water out of there.I returned the pump same day to Amazon. Amazon's service is excellent.As soon as they received the pumpthey returned my money. So do not buy this pump if you need to lift it more than few feet.I bought another pump with same size motor and it worked excellent.
3,Good pump when it works.,This pump is great when it's working. It can pump a lot of water out even with a longer hose. The only problem is that sometimes it will overheat even under water and cause the water pump to pump inconsistently. The customer service at Wayne Water Systems is not very friendly.
5,great product just that simple,this product did just what it said it would do. I highly recommend it. I love amozon they sell great things like this.
1,Not So Good...,"Pump cuts off after 5 minutes, and then repeats. Might have something to do with the internal thermostat? Don't really care to be honest. I was willing to give this one a shot and because it cuts off after a few minutes, and because of its less then stellar performance while operating, I went with another pump. I ended up spending a tad bit more and picked up a 1/2 HP flo-tech sump pump that works great. I like Amazon's no hassle return. I just wrapped it back up and dumped it by the front door."
3,Water Pump,"Pump does clean to within 1/8th inch of bottom, however in order to do this, it may shut off due to heat, as it requires water for cooling around the pump. I purchased this for a pool cleaning, and it dropped off several times on overheat prior to finishing the job. The water hose adapter works, but if using the normal outlet, it is still limited in GPH. This is best to have in tamdem with a faster pump that does not have such limitations."
3,Wayne 1/2 HP pump,"It worked right out of the box. I used the included garden hose connector and hooked up a 50 ft, 5/8ths inch hose. The rise from the bottom of the pump was about 4 feet. The flow I got was about 5 gallons a minute, a bit slower than I expected, but it worked okay for what I needed. I may get a larger and shorter hose and I think it will improve a lot. My use was to drain the last six inches of waster out of a landscape pond and I liked the pumping to the last 1/8 inch of water. It did clog with debris once for me and I took off the bottom cover. It was easy to do."
5,Mary from Brookfield WI,"I purchased this pump about 6 months ago. It is great. We have had very heavy, flooding rain here for days and our sub pump could not keep up. We used this pump and it kept the crock from over flowing and our basement dry! Thanks Amazon for having it, and thanks to Wayne for making it!"
3,"Works, not fully as promised","My only complaint is that it has just as many problems with leafs and any other pump. they do get stuck. its easy to pull out, but not what was advertisted. i like that you can hook up two different size hoses with adaptor to speed up pumping. Used three times in last three weeks. see how long pump lives for."
5,Using in my basement it pumps a ton of water,"I got this to use as a below the floor sump pump for my basementafter experiencing the effects of a rising water table from3 straight days of rain in March when the ground was still partially frozen.Pump is on as I type and this thing moves some serious water.I've got it connected to a 1.25"" hose out tothe street running into the storm drain. Very happy with thepump and Amazon got it to me fast!"
4,Pump purchase,This was my first time making a purchase on Amazon and I was pleased with the pump that I purchased. It was a very easy process and I received the product earlier than expected.
4,"Wayne Water Systems VIP50 1/2 HP 2,500 GPH Submersible Utility Water Pump",I bought this pump to remove rain water from the top of an inground plastic pool cover. The leaves and debris caused the pump to clog. It also sucked the plastic pool cover into the intake keeping the pump from working properly. I had to dill holes on the side of the pumps skirt to allow it to pump out the rain water without sucking the plastic pool cover into the intake. Maybe the 1/4 HP submersible pump would have been a better choice. Now the 1/2 HP submersible pump works great.
2,Gets too hot; does not go down to 1/8 of an inch and gets vapor locked,"I bought this pump as I needed to empty out a sump in my backyard. The water level was pumped to 2 feet before I lowered this in to finish the job. The bottom of the sump is level, so I should have gotten to at least an inch of depth without trouble (as I've done this with another utility pump).After starting the pump, it worked great. Then it just stopped pumping. Unplugging it and trying again, it worked. Each time it seemed like it would vapor lock if the pump moved a little while it was running.Around 10 minutes later, it stopped pumping and there was still 4 inches of water left. The verticle lift required was around 8 feet.I gave up and pulled this pump out. I noticed a seal must have broken as I found some oily residue leaking out of the pump as well as steam coming from the left over water.Note: I give this 2 stars as it worked REALLY well with mud and my garden hose before switching to 1"" PVC pipe."
4,Waer Pump,"Although just received it a few days ago, and have only used it one time for getting water off of my pool cover, I woud have to say, so far I am very pleased with it, in that it is doing its job. That's what I wanted it to do"
3,Lackluster conducting spoils this one,"Decca stuck by Dutoit for a decade as their house French onductor, but his recodings, though spectacular in sound, never amounted to the real thing emotionally. He is a cool, detached leader even in Berlioz, where that kind of aloofness makes no musical or dramatic sense. Despite the excellent sonics and the skilled performers, this isn't a memorable version of the Requiem."
3,Nowhere as good as his first book,".Graysmith wrote THE book, ""Zodiac,"" on this serial killer. That one is well worth reading.This sequel? Not so much.The short version of this day by day, almost 500 pages ""unmasking"" is his preferred suspect had handwriting and fingerprints which didn't match the Zodiac's and passed a lie detector. The district attorney refused to prosecute the guy. All that can be explained and Graysmith tries--but it's a hard road.The chronology bounces around. We're talking about 1973, then suddenly the date changes to 1963 with no segue. It's more like a scrapbook, with the author assuming the reader knows the back story.Read the first book, which also discusses his favorite pick, and kindly ignore this second effort."
3,Entertaining,"Entertaining, but very similar to the first book in the series. However, it gets very focused on one particular individual as the Zodiac."
1,"Really, really, really badly written.","I also reviewed Graysmith's ""Zodiac"" and said that it was a great story crying out for a better writer. This book lacks a great story and is written less well than the first. There are passages in this book which are so garbled and confusing that the meaning can't be discovered at all, even if you read them five or six times. I put it down about a third of the way through after reading and re-reading a passage about the significance of the Mt. Diablo map that was utterly bewildering. I don't intend to finish it."
3,A good second Zodiac work,"I find this is a good follow up read to Graysmith's other Zodiac book. In order to fully appreciate it, you must read the earlier. Yes, the information is already available in other formats; and yes, he leans towards Allen to the exclusion of others. But, the evidence appears almost overwhelming, and he uses it well to prove his point."
3,the definitive work on the subject!,"I read the first book about two years ago and it sucked me right in. Now this book has shed light on the most notorious suspect, arthur leigh allen.Graysmith has brought to life again this twisted tale of the masked murderer and this time he includes chapters on the two copycat killers as well. Take a chance even if your only remotely interested in the case."
2,Nothing new in Graysmith's Zodiac Unmasked,"Robert Graysmith has convinced himself that Leigh Allen was the Zodiac. The book is an interesting read but nothing more than a spin on very weak circumstancial evidence. I wonder why the 2 SFPD that confronted the Zodiac after the brutal murder were never able to indentify Allen as the Zodiac. No prints, nothing close to suggesting Allen wrote the letter and cryptograms, nobody placing him anywhere near the scene of any of the crimes. They just never had even close to a case but Graysmith actually belives that he has uncovered the deceased Zodiac. I am not convinced."
2,I'd give it 3 stars if it was fiction,"I'd give this book 3 stars if it was in the fiction section, but it's not. A very interesting read that breaks the cardinal rule: If you enter a case with preconceptions of guilt, your likely to make the evidence fit your assumption. At times it's painful to watch Graysmith twist the evidence to support his theory and dismiss evidence that doesn't. His first book on the Zodiac was very good but this one feels like it was written by a cartoonist, not a reporter."
2,Too confusing,"I read the original Zodiac book shortly after its release and loved it. I have been fascinated with the case ever sense. It was well written and keeps the reader interested from start to finish. However, the Zodiac Unmasked is different. The author jumps back and forth in time and repeats information so many times it is nearly impossible to correctly follow what is happening. Though the book has some interesting information not included or available for the original book, it is a chore working through the book to get it. I was very dissappointed with this book after enjoying the first and the movie so much. Unless you are a die hard slueth that cannot get enough of this case, I would avoid this one and stick to the first."
1,Too Much Information,"This book is a terribly confusing rendition of the Zodiac investigation. There are too many people, too many details of the dead ends the police pursued, and the author jumps around in time too much. I had to make myself finish it, and I'm not sure why I bothered, since it is clear from the second chapter who the author has identified as Zodiac. I understand the desire to put together an airtight case, but this is overkill. Ironically, the only area in which there is insufficient info is the description of the various offenses committed by Zodiac. The author sometimes refers to them by place names other times he uses victim names, and the narrative is so disjointed that, even now, I'm not sure how many victims or separate incidents were attributed to Zodiac by this author."
1,What a hack this guy is...,"Truth, what is truth? If you'd like to know the answer to this question, don't ask Graysmith because truth is not apparently important to him. It also does not seem a requirement for journalism in his eyes. All of Graysmith's Zodiac theories twist or disregard facts in order to point to a non-suspect. Allen was not the Zodiac and anyone who has researched the case and has even one fourth of a brain can see that.You know how when a six-year-old is caught in a lie and they can't admit it and they just keep saying ""Nu-huh,"" this is what this book is to me."
4,"Good follow-up to the movie ""Zodiac""...","I am amazed at the hostility against this book demonstrated by several reviewers. I found Graysmith's case against Leigh Allen to be persuasive. I bought this one right after seeing the new ""Zodiac"" film, which I also liked. With that background, or a background from having read Graysmith's ""Zodiac"" book from many years ago, ""Unmasked"" is a worthy read. I would not advise anyone without familiarity of the case to pick this up first, however. It is a complicated story that stretches from 1966 to the 1990's and beyond, and has a cast of scores of cops and suspects and victims and their family members. If you liked the movie, you probably don't need to read ""Zodiac."" Try ""Unmasked"" instead. How some readers can think that Arthur Leigh Allen is NOT the most likely killer is beyond me, but mysteries and conspiracies attract us precisely because we all think we can do better than the cops and reporters in coming up with a solution."
2,Interesting FICTION,"This book along with Graysmith's earlier book, ""Zodiac"" were the defining history of the Zodiac killer case of the late 60's and early 70's. Unfortunatley, Graysmith's theories and observations were later proved false and misguided via DNA, fingerprints and other important physical evidence. However, the author continues to lead the investigation astray and has even divised a remarkably stupid theory to circumvent the lack of a DNA match by stating perhaps someone other than the Zodiac licked the envelopes that the Zodiac mailed to the press.....??Although the author is misguided and perhaps delusional, the books did make an interesting movie this year and for that I appreciate his misguided efforts."
1,curiosity killed the Kat!,"Robert Graysmith's first book ZODIAC I must admit to having read 5 times since it first came out. In the back of my copy are many articles clipped over the years on Z. I grew up in Marin county California and was a teen during Z's reign if terror. Robert Graysmiths 2nd attempt failed to ignite my fire. Frankly, his ""facts"" concerning ALA left me shaking my head. Hmmm... I see its listed used at Amazon for $2. Its worth it for that price. But don't spend $25 as I did on the hard cover. Will the identity of Z ever be known? Would he be so popular if he'd been caught? I don't think so. We, those interested in Z, have that intense desire to know who he is. I honestly can understand RG's obsession."
2,Not as good as it should have been,"Author too long winded. I love true crime, but this book just couldn't hold my attention."
2,Rewriting History,"Graysmith mentions that Arthur Leigh Allen's father was named after the Revolutionary War soldier Ethan Allen who was caught and hung. Wrong. It was Nathan Hale that was hung. If Graysmith can't even get simple history correct how are we supposed to believe the ""facts"" that he has presented in this highly convoluted book?"
1,A cure for insomnia,"I would like to comment on the content of this book, but I have read only 25 pages and I have fallen asleep four times. This book is very poorly written. It is confusing and poorly organized. It starts in the middle of the story and then meanders around endlessly. I sure would like my money back."
2,"rambling and not ""scary good""","I am a connssiuer of this type of book;..and this book just does not engage me..doesn't scare me, and doesn't do a thing for me.I find myself reading back and forth tryng to first-- find who the hell Allen is in the pictures, when the book is talking about a ""Starr""! I mean.. maybe this isn't a big deal, but the continuity of the book depends on us knowing who the heck this person is-- especially if we-- like everyone else-- flips to the pics just as we're getting started on the read.I found that very confusing. Do I have to read the first book to ""get"" all of this?I find this a very boring read. It rambles, and the syntax is terrible! Not a good flow... I fall asleep every time I pick it up..this is not good for a crime story!I want to be excited.. and thanks to all who recommended the other zodiac books..because I find nothing scarier in this story than the drawing of zodiac with the hood.. that's about as scary as Graysmith gets. He's a good sketch artist."
4,Good but not that good,"This CD got an editor's choice recommendation in Gramophone and has been touted on amazon as direct communion with God and the like. Based on all this hype I got the CD, but it is not all that in my view. One thing I found jarring is that Hunt often doesn't pronounce the consonants at the end of syllables. The first aria is sung as ""ich habe genoo ich habe genoo"" not ""ich habe genug""! Hunt also swoops in and out of the notes. Very much an old school romantic approach. I guess that's what people like about the CD. Hunt is supposed to be very emotional in her singing (I didn't really get that out of it). The oboe playing is nice. Anyway, it's a decent rendition but before you feel like you just have to get this CD (like I did) be forewarned that it's not that special."
3,Is this really the best?,"This recording of BWV 199 leaves something to be desired, at least to my ears. I find the singing strident; perhaps, a bit coarse. Prefer Kozena in John Eliot Gardiner's version -DGG 463-591-2"
4,Not afraid to mix fun with a serious side,"Black 47 is an interesting band. When they are looking for a good time few bands can match them. ""Delirious,"" ""Desperate,"" ""Bodhrans on the Brain,"" and ""I Got Laid on James Joyce's Grave"" are all fine examples of the band at its wildest; ska and Celtic rhythms meet in an unholy amalgamation that can't help but get your feet moving as a smile creeps across your face. But the band sets its sights a bit higher than just party music. Racism and American and Irish politics are all topics open for examination as well the deeper emotions that welcome a poet's touch. Occasionally heavy-handed (""Bobby Kennedy being a prime example of going a bit over the top)"") but never boring, Black 47 is a band that deserves a wider audience."
2,A lackluster effort...,"Anyone looking for the usual catchy and/or reflective melodies from Black 47 won't find many of them on this album. ""Delirious"" and ""Bobby Kennedy"" (tracks 3 and 4) are laughably awful, although the songwriting quality does pick up after these two tracks...especially in the lyrics department. ""Those Saints"" (2) and ""Bodhrans On The Brain"" (6) are easily the most fun, but they don't really stand out like past hits such as ""Green Suede Shoes"" and ""Funky Ceili"".The back cover of the album case gives a short description of the band's style, presumably because this is their first release on the Shanachie label. It's clearly targeted at those who have never heard the band, and reads as follows:""A streetwise mix of rock, reggae, ska and Irish music paired with evocative lyrics steeped in history, politics, and tales of the immigrant experience.""A note to those who have never heard the band: pick up the ""Green Suede Shoes"" album instead. You'll get much more out of that release."
3,just another weight training book,"ok, book. But it does not make specific reference to bowling and howthese exercises help. I really could have passed..."
2,Weight Training Book,I'm sure this is a good weight training book but it linksvery few of the excercises to actual bowling improvement.
3,Not bad,Not a bad little guide.BTW it's cheaper to just buy it from the author's website.....just look at the 2nd page of the excerpt.
1,More Bodybuilding Type Nonsense,"Bowling at the top level requires good physical conditioning and unfortunately this isn't the book to provide that kind of information. Lots of isolation exercises and typical workouts from the bodybuilding era. I'm not sure if they realize most people reading this book aren't on steroids and would benefit more from a general strength and fitness program, more than they would from the program laid out in this book. Overall hugely disappointing and further perpetuating training programs that don't make sense for an athletic population."
3,Why kids think history is dull,"I have read nearly all of the Hornblower books and I had hoped this one would have some of the excitement and energy of the war of 1812 at sea. However, what Forester gives us is a mere recitation of facts: names of captains, names of ships and who won the battle. The first chapter is an excellent discussion of why Madison went to war on the side of Napoleon."
3,Photo was a bit deceptive,"I incorrectly assumed that the wires were black (same color as the lights themselves); therefore, I was a bit disappointed. I should have requested more detail."
5,Living When A Loved One Has Died,"My husband died at 47 of lung cancer. I went to grief counseling and purchased any book or piece of information I could find to help me through the grieving process. This book, by far, has helped me the most. It was easy to read when my concentration level was at an all- time low. This was written by someone who has obviously been through this experience. I keep several copies of this book on hand to give to friends as the need arises.This is a book that can be read and re-read many times. It has brought me great peace and comfort over these last 4 years.Thank you so much Rabbi Grollman!"
5,A Must Read When You Lose A Loved One,"My husband Jim died at the age of 50. We had been together since 1972, 27 years, and had grown up together. Jim was a Vietnam veteran and suffered from the effects of Agent Orange that over the years manifested itself in many ways. His tired body finally gave up after many years of suffering. But he fought it with everything he had - and survived many years beyond what the doctors told him he would live. But in the end, he knew it was time to go and he did it with dignity. A friend gave me this book and at first I could not read it, then slowly I would open it and read a little, and then a little more. I can't tell you how many times I have read it now. It is reality, simple and to the point. It is easy to read and it is me, it is scary how much it is me. And now I have a friend who just lost her husband and I am sending it to her so that she can read it and hopefully get the comfort and understanding that only we can know."
5,Gentle but honest,"This book is a great book to give to a friend who has just lost a loved one. (I lost my son 5 years ago and enjoyed it.) It is gentle in that it is easy to read and does not go into lengthy discussions on topics. However, what it does discuss is so completely honest about what we feel as we grief. Highly reccomend!"
5,Living When a Loved One Has Died,It helps others to see how important it is to express the many emotions that a person will go through and how to do this and eventually continue on with ones life and still feel and care for the one that has gone on.
5,Death of a friend...,"It has been almost a year since my wife died suddenly and unexpectedly. Since then I've spent much time reading and pondering, trying to come to terms with my new reality. This is one of two books I found which provided enough comfort that I've given copies to other newly berieved widows and widowers."
5,Share With a Friend,"This book was recommended from someone who had shared it with a friend who had recently lost his wife. This book made such a difference in this person's attitude toward life that I purchased several copies to share with people I care about who lose loved ones.This is a quick, easy read."
4,In a field lacking choice there is no need to choose another,"Unfortunately, I did not have the option of choosing to take this class from the co-author Professor Frickey, however, this book more than made up for that.This is an excellent book on a topic which unfortunately receives little attention at most law schools. This book provides lawyers or law students with the analytic skills necessary to be successful at practice and at class. In addition if you do not develop those skills you can always use the plethora of statutory cannons contained in this book."
2,What a great reference,I love this book. It is well written and researched and is a wonderful gateway to more research into the world of Talmud.
3,My Thoughts,"The book isnt too bad. I found that there are too many scooters covered in one book however. I have just one scooter in this book, a Piaggio Skipper. To follow a detailed description of how to do a task can be confusing, as the difference between scooters is blurred. ""Is this a picture of a Skipper carb, or a Hexagon?"" you find yourself asking. However If you perserver you might be able to work things out. There are not enough diagrams for the scooters covered. For example you can get a detailed diagram of the cylinder head assembley of a NRG MC2, Zip SP,Hexagon but not the Sfera 50/80, all typhoons, ET2 skipper"
4,Amazon description error,"The ""Format"" line in the Amazon description of this DVD states that it is in color and widescreen. Both of these are incorrect. This is not the colorized version and it is a full-frame (4/3) not a widescreen (16/9) image. The DVD case accurately states this so the error is Amazon's.This does not detract from the fact that this is a delightful movie that showcases Shirley at her best."
4,"Stunning voice, mixed performance","Karan Casey has few rivals for sheer vocal beauty in Irish music, and this album shows her voice off beautifully. The only blemishes are two of the three protest songs--the arrangement of 'World Turned Upside Down' is strident and distracting, and while her rendition of MacColl's 'Ballad of Accounting' is creditable, its repeated phrases are perhaps the least pleasant singing I've heard from her. There's plenty to love about this album, from the breathtaking unaccompanied 'An Buachaillin Ban' and 'Laboring Man's Daughter' to the feisty and funny 'Roger the Miller'."
4,very well done,"you get plenty of matches in this dvd you also get a documentary in this one about the rocks career with commentary from y2j,mick foley,stone cold,hhh and a few other so that makes it worth it on it self but it really good dvd its a must have and the rock also gives his reason why he left for 7 years from the wwe so go pick it up its worth it"
3,hubby liked it,I'm not much into wresling. My hubby likes that kind of stuff. I like Dwayne in some of the movies he is in
3,Meh.,I wouldn't recommend really recommend this. Not very well put together at all. Not much of a documentary. They rushed this out for Wrestlemania 28 and it really showed.
4,Hoping this has a detailed bio,So I own the rock Just Bring It which was a decent dvd had rock talk but mainly just about his late 00-summer 2001 carrer such as movies his fued with austin comming back when wwf was facing wcw etc. The 2nd dvd the rock most elecfrying man was just matches but was good. Im hoping this dvd goes into deatail about his whole carrer&has some matches that are rare to dvd or matches that have only been released on ppv dvds not his most elcerfrying man or just bring it dvd
4,CENAS BOOT TO ROCK ASS,"Wrestlemania 28 rock vs cena, and the winner will be john cena. The rock has been out of wrestling for more then 8 years and even then he lost more matches then he won. The only reason he is back is because people was forgetting who he was, so too remind people he would just pop back up in wrestling, too sell more of his movie tickets. John cena like him or not has been on the road busting his butt for the buisness he loves. You can say all the child like remarks you want to about him, but he is the reason people buy wwe tickets and watch the tv shows. That is why i says cena boot to rock ass, because i believe cena will win at wrestlemania 28. ALSO, ROCKY SUCKS, LETS GO CENA !!!!!!!!"
5,BABY GIRLS WARDROBE,THIS SWEATER IS ADORABLE! SERVICE WAS GREAT! I'VE ORDERED OTHER ITEMS ALSO AND WAS JUST AS PLEASED!
3,the story continues...,"i like the cavanaugh justice series. the plots are easy and they make light reading. i am especially intrigued with the sub plot that runs through them of the missing mother. the plot was not finished in this book (shucks i need to read the next one too) a nice book to curl up with on a rainy day or to read over time (because the plot is easy enough to keep up with with long breaks in between. not great litature, but fun."
2,How many versions of Pimpernel are we to endure?,"Granted I liked the first version of the show which was the original broadway cast, the first original broadway cast recording, and then they turned around and changed the show so many times my heads still spinning. Why mess with the best? It'd be as if Sondheim and Webber decided to rework each other's musicals without telling the other. Don't waste your money."
5,Lait Nettoyant,I have used this product for a long time and really like it. It was not as easy to buy it bwfoew as ir was through Amazon since my account is already set up there.
2,YONKA Non Comedogenic Cleansing Milk,"Product is good, however, it arrived in a damaged container and was leaking all over the place! Disappointed by the vendor."
5,must have dub :),"Bill Laswell and a load of friends kick out some spacey dub, thick in the groove and thicker in the bass. Drop in lots of kicky samples and general madness ensues. Oh, my, but these songs take their time. A gorgeous, languid feel pervades the songs. No hurry to get anywhere, no worries at all. Just some beautiful, low down funk. Yeah, and you gotta love the space invaders concept (from artwork to the sampled subjects). Goofy and entrancing. A real dirty, fried chicken sound from the production. Lots of crackles and pops, a lot of everything. Meandering in a cool stew. Oh, yeah, this is on the edge of comprehension. But the sound is so deep, there's always something new to discover. Just trip along into the groove and see where your mind ends up..."
1,Do Not Buy - Poor Quality Product,"I bought this set, and almost ninety days to the minute after the warranty expired the set broke down, after which a perfectly pleasant customer service representative told me I was on my own. Nice concept, poor execution. My advice, find a better model."
2,coffe table tv,"In less that a year, the remote quit. Got another one from Remotes.Com. It didn't work either, so therefore assuming the problem is in the TV as I have been told by a technician. TV itself has nice picture, but no remote now. Disappointed."
1,Poor Quality,"A nice little TV to start, but had problems with DC operation (wouldn't come on sometimes). Quit working after first year, requiring $183.00 to repair."
1,Disappointing product,"I used this product in my kitchen. Twenty days past the warranty expiration, the picture went blank and the unit made a buzzing noise. Customer service referred me to a service center, for which I would need to pay $65 for a diagnosis. Very disappointing for a $200 tv/dvd."
2,"Decent picture, poor sound and quality of product","We purchased this set for our kitchen and to travel in our SUV on trips. Worked great for the first year; however the sound isnt that good since the speakers point 90degrees out away from where you are viewing from. TV broke, picture went plank (or should I say all but a small line which appeared to be the picture). After this problem the TV is now useless, very disappointing with this toshiba product. The is my second toshiba TV (the other one, 27 inch, lost it's sound) and will be my last. Poor quality!"
5,Just what I ordered,"When I ordered these batteries, I hoped they were what I needed for my watches. They were! I was able to change the batteries in my watches with no problems. I am delighted with this purchase."
5,Wonderful Food History,"This book is not just thoroughly researched, but is very entertainingly written. For those of us who have been eating Local Food for years, but never really inquiring why we love it so, here is the unraveling of many a mystery. Our love of rice can be seen as a triumph of climate and culture, but the entire crack seed phenomenon is also excellently explored by an adventurous and appreciative non-Local.Thank you, Rachel Laudan, for opening up our history and unique culinary explorations."
5,Amazingly Though,"This book beautifully covers subjects just as, judging others and self , the light and the darkness, The ego, soul mates, The human idea of separation as a opposed to Oneness....among many, many othersI learned a great dealIt has much for the beginner as well as the experienced New Age reader. I'd recommend it to anyone and have given copies to friends. I hope in the near future, more of the author's books are translated from French to English"
4,well written,"a well written, concise book...lots of details left out, but, for the most part, quite enjoyable.."
4,My Opinion--from an amature,"This product had everything I needed to decorate some cakes and cupcakes. Easy to clean and good quality.I am new to this and I think if you are just starting out, purchase a kit with a larger bag or a different material. It maybe easier until you get the hang of it. On this smaller bag, it didn't stay twisted and frosting came out the top."
3,First cake decorating set!,"The pastry bag came a little loose around the coupler, causing half of the tips to screw on awkwardly. I attempted to make a tighter fit by cutting off more of the pastry bag end, but that didn't help either. It's still usable, but sometimes the frosting leaks out. I still believe in Ateco products and going to buy another pastry bag, because the material is nice and clean up is easy. This may be just one misfortune."
5,One of my favorite books set in/about Jamaica,"I'm surprised there aren't more reviews here for this from the Jamaica-book junkies. I'm a huge fan of Anthony Winkler, Guy Kennaway, Robert Roskind, Russell Banks....but this book is really special.It's about a retired couple who set out to build a home and settle in Jamaica. The people they meet - neighbors, tradesmen, clerks, are all described with loving humor. The sometimes frustrating process of building and settling in is balanced by the great love they share for Jamaica, land and people.I highly recommend it for Jamaicaphiles."
5,Fantastic!,"""What Would W Do"" is intelligent, thoughtful and hilarious. My favorite part is one of the responses to what W would do if he was captain of the Titanic: ""Tell Iceburg it hates freedom."" That kills me. I bought this book a little while ago and I keep reading it over and over, sharing it with my friends...it was my best purchase of the summer! You must read this book!"
4,affirmation,This is the best savage garden yet. There are so many beautiful song on this album. I knew I loved you is beautiful but not the others are just as good. Take your time to listen to it
4,Grain of Salt,"I think you have to read this with and grain of understanding. If the love scene was between two human's than yes it would be rape and nothing sexy about it. But these are two non human-Dragon type beings. And Yes in the animal world it's about the male capturing and dominating the female. in many cases of fictional dragon love the female shows contempt for a male until he proves with his brutish behavor that he is capable of dominateing her. So that is how I read this story as dragons in human form. And while I agree that the leading lady was very strong and independant, she did not become that until she had escaped from her homeland and people. I found it very plossible that once confronted with that life again she would have reverted to the fear and weekness that had defined her life before her escape. But it did not lower my oppion of her, she realised that she had to go back home and found the strength to accept and appreciate it."
3,Mediocre,"This book was pretty good. Sort of intriguing but very predictable. You could pretty much tell exactly where the book was going from page 1, but that's not to say it isn't an enjoyable read, because it it. The main characters were relatable, and fleshed out, they were a good match and Rue definitely didn't just roll over for Kit, she made him work for it. On an interesting note, there wasn't you'd call a 'bad guy' in the book, that's pretty well accepted in every book, but not this one! There were a couple enemies but none of them were villains, it was an interesting plot choice, that definitely paid off. All in all it was an enjoyable read, and definitely worth a shot."
1,Confusing a bully for a hero,"I hate it when a good idea and good writing gets ruined by the misconception that a manipultive, abusive liar is a romantic lead. Christoff repeatedly ignores, insults, and disrepects the heroine. When he finally bullies her into submission, they ride off into the sunset, happy and in love.In a ""passionate"" moment, he doesn't care if it is ""rape or seduction"" as long as he can have sex with Clarissa. Any hero that can confuse rape with passion is no hero.I like a strong male as the love interest, but when his ""strength"" destoys her hopes and makes her miserable, I could only feel disgust for him and for her for not having the backbone with him that she had everywhere in the rest of her life."
3,I feel the need to voice some dissent...,"I enjoyed the premise of a shape-shifting dragon romance with an independent female. However, as a sci-fi/fantasy lover and enjoyer of fully fleshed out plot lines, I was disappointed. The heroine was not particularly clever or tough in the end and the hero fell a bit short too. The basic idea and characters were good, enjoyable and promising but both remained simplistic. The follow-through was lacking as development of the story did not progress much and the characters and their relationship did not develop. I hope the next book is better but I'm not sure that I will purchase it, at least not as a hardcover. However, if you enjoy Abe and are not much of a sci-fi/fantasy reader, this is probably a book you would enjoy."
3,A Good read that needs more Development,"I thought this book was good but not fantastic. The idea of ""The Drakon"" combined with the setting of England rather than some made up land, makes the book unique and refreshing if you've read a lot of fantasy. However, the concept could've been taken so much further. I thought the book would be mostly about a conflict The Drakon were having and the Romance part wouldn't be the focus. Don't get me wrong I love Romance, but the book lost some of its appeal when I discovered it was just another romance book. There isn't much of a conflict, it is just a story about Kit and Rue, The Drakon are mearly apart of the setting. Shana Abe keeps herself from being a great author by not making the story more complex. It is a good read and I will continue with the series, but I am a little disappointed."
4,Well written historical fantasy romance novel!,"Accidentally, bought ""The Dream Theif"" first, but luckily was warned to read this first. I hate when I read books out of order, and this is no exception. ""The Smoke Thief,"" begins the stories of the Drakon. Abe's developments of character's lacks a little, especially regards to the Council, but the two main character's - Amalia and Langford, are quite well executed. I can't wait for the series to be developed."
4,the drakon series,"i loved this book and the next 2 in the series. The 4th book,the treasure keeper was alittle confusing but I am rereading it before I read time weaver( the conclusion) because I started time weaver and was also a little confused. I loved the characters and although normally I steer clear of romance novels, theses were highly entertaining because of the fact that they were so outlandish and unrealistic and plus there was action which balanced the romance out. I thought these books were great escapes and would reccomend them for an older audience."
2,Couldn't Find the Books Mood,"Having enjoyed ""Intimate Enemies"" by Shana Abe, I looked forward to reading ""The Smoke Thief"". I thought this book suffered from a lack of focus - it just seemed all over the place. After the first 100 pages I still couldn't figure out exactly who was what, what was what, and where they were. That's not to say there weren't some good sections, but I actually had to read the other reviews to get a deeper sense of the story. So, given that, I'd say all in all, the main characters of Kit and Clarissa could have used more depth, the background of the Drakon should have been edited down and simplified, and the story more streamlined. Would have made a better book, and the mood of the book may have come alive, which for me, it didn't."
3,"Love Dragons, Shape Shifting but just OK for me...","I enjoyed this story well enough but just not great. I love the idea of shape shifting and all of the fantasy that goes with it but this story seemed small to me. I keep looking for a great fantasy romance story that was as good as ""The World of Hetar"" by Bertrice Small."
2,Why build me up only to let me down?....,"I was extremely excited when I first purchased this book! The beginning was purely addictive and I couldn't put it down...... But after around page 100, it started dragging when it needed a twist or a turn. The excitement level was low and it didn't have any subplots or interesting characters to fill any of my voids. Abe gave ALOT of details about surroundings, furniture, and clothing, when she should have been developing the main characters more. I did not connect with Kit at all, and not so much with Rue. Awwww man! The potential :-( Oh, and the sex between the two main characters was probably the worst I've ever read. You would think Drakons would get really down and dirty.... Such a shame. Good day my friends!"
3,Minority report,"I know I am definitely in the minority here, but The Smoke Thief was, to me, not a great book. I found I could put it down and in fact, had trouble finishing it. I found the heroine, Rue, to be quite likable in the beginning, but after she went to London, I found I really didn't like her. I didn't like her hard edges. And, I found it sort of unbelievable that she left when she was seventeen because she didn't want Kit to love her because he had to. I don't know--I have read other fantasy novels and quite enjoy them, but this one was just not the ticket. For me, anyway. To each his own.It did have a beautiful cover, thought. That is what caught my attention in the first place."
2,Derivitive of another author's Carpathian race...,"I felt there were too many similarites to Christine Feehan's ""Dark"" series. Even the animalistic tendencies of our supposed hero Kit reminded me of Feehan's whole irresistable lifemate plotline.Short on character development, clipped plotline, a heroine with a huge chip on her shoulder, a little enchantment... the dragon lure keeps you reading and waiting for something unique and interesting to happen. It never quite does. A better plot would have put this in a class with Naomi Novik's HIS MAJESTY'S DRAGON. Better characters and more fleshed out Dragonrace lore would have made it almost as good as Feehan's Dark series.RECOMMENDED: Naomi Novik's Temeraire series HIS MAJESTY'S DRAGON, THRONE OF JADE, and BLACK POWDER WAR."
4,A very nice work glove,"I got this after seeing it featured on the home and garden chanel. I needed a nice soft pair of gloves for working around the house and yard, to protect my hands and nails.I like these a lot, nice and soft with room for moderate length nails. They are comfortable, strong and look to be very well made. i am glad I got them and would recommend them highly."
3,a bit tight,"good quality gloves but even the large size is rather tight... too tight for garden work in the dirt but fine (but tight) for shoveling, mowing, etc."
3,Good video but a little dated and quality is so so,I liked the video because I love gospel. I was able to deal with the techinical short issues. If you are a gospel lover you will enjoy it as well.
5,Very catchy tune!,"A little taste of Elvis and the swing of the Stray Cats combine into a wonderful beat and style. Steve Holy has a unique way of blending swing and dance into a modern country/pop melody. A refreshing new voice, just what country music needs!"
5,Love that swing sound!,"Here's something you don't hear everyday, a Country/Swing sound. This song has to be one of the best I've heard this year. Did I mention that awesome swing sound?"
3,product seemed flimsy,"product fit okay, but not great. wind noise was not reduced with this sunroof deflector though it did block light rain."
4,"Pretty good, but...","Make sure that you read that little sticker when you enlarge the album art image; it says ""LIMITED EDITION DOUBLE CD (contains disc 1 disc 2 available seperately)."" It's still a good CD. However, I own the Cornflake Girl single (that has ""Daisy Dead Petals"") and I wanted ""Black Swan"" and the other version of ""Honey"" mostly, that's on the 2nd disc (sold separately) and that also comes with ""Pretty Good Year."" I don't really care for ""Home on the Range""; since I have memories of my dad singing this song like a fool when I was a little kid, I can't get used to this version of it. Obviously, this review is all opinion, and I just wanted to let people know that this product only has the first single with ""Pretty Good Year"", ""Home on the Range"", and ""Daisy Dead Petals."" Happy Holidays! Ciao! :)"
2,Hoover vaccuums do what?,"Suck. This album has one or two good songs on it. I have overplayed The world is mine and then discarded the CD. I will never listen to the album in its entirety again. I tried and tried, but like my vacuum, this album sucks. Sad because I love Hooverphonic's Power of Milk and all their earlier stuff. I am sadly disappointed with all these hopeful and promising reveiws that led me to buy this unreturnable reminder of this enormous waste of my money and hour of life I will never get back. Hooverphonic go back to your old style!Save the soft love songs for Delilah!"
3,They are Too Sexy!,"This song is too much! I LOVE IT! These guys but out great records, but this version is too close to the original to get my goat!"
5,Austin Lunch,"I loved this book. As a Greek American and native of Chicago, this was a treat to read. Also purchased it for my Aunt and two Uncles."
5,Delicious!!,"""Austin Lunch"" is absolutely delicious!! The author captures the smells and feelings of the time.She shares authentic events that are ""typically"" Greek. Being Greek myself, I can relate on so many levels.A must read for anyone interested in an era gone by."
2,This IS NOT a real flag.,"It is one sided, extremely thin. You can see through it. It would be ok to put on a wall, but not to fly."
3,A Little Too Much,"Trevor Scott's Jake Adams is to good to be true. I found that I just could not believe Jake Adams could continue to operate after his severe beatings, etc. I've had a broken rib and believe me for Jake Adams to do what he did in this book would make him superhuman. However, the plot of the book was good and interesting. I will read Trevor Scott again. Just wish he wouldn't be so brutal when someone gets beat up."
3,Adventure Story,This is a good book but not an excellent one. Very simple story line with few characters.
4,Vital Force by Trevor Scott,Very good writer I recomend this book. I have read several Trevor Scott books and will continue reading his books.
4,Very good,"Liked all of the books. Good read. Don't have time to rate them all, but suggest if you buy one you buy them all since you will want to read another once you finish one."
4,Worth the Price,"Trevor Scott stories are good entertainment and well worth their price of $0.99. All I have read have an interesting spy overcome great odds to beat the bad guys, seducing a few beautiful gals on the way.If you believe good should overcome evil, the stories will not keep you awake pondering some deep philosophical question."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"This is the third in the Kingsley Baby series by Amanda Stevens, and the entire trilogy is nothing short of wonderful. If you've never read her books before you're in for a treat! She's right up there with Sandra Brown and Tami Hoag. Don't miss this series!!!"
4,It comes alive!,"While the war that the author of this book served through is often called ""The Forgotten War,"" I feel it is WWI that has become such a part of our past that we almost forget the role it played in our history. David Homsher brings home the service and sacrifice of so many brave men in his historically accurate recount of World War I. This is a must have for every red blooded American!-Pete Mitchell, Co-Author of Modern Day Heroes: In Defense of America"
4,fun movie if you're a Jackie fan,"I have every Jackie Chan movie that can be purchased. This is not one of my favorites, but if you're a big fan it's definitely worth having. It is funny, and you get to see Jackie doing many things you haven't seen him do before. Unfortunately he did not do all of his own stunts in this movie due to an injury, but it is neat to see him on screen again with his little brother, Yuen Biao. There are many extra features and footage included with this release."
5,The best female Carnatic vocalist,I was lucky enough to see Sudha at the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival in Pune India a couple of years ago. She was a stunning performer live. My favorite vocalist of the entire festival. And her CD's are great as well. Highly recommended!
5,Goodman Live @ Carnegie Hall 1938,"I just received the Goodman Carnegie Hall concert album. I feel very fortunate to own a copy of the original concert, uncut. I have been playing jazz music for over 50 years, therefore I feel somewhat qualified to recommend this recording. Buy this album and treat yourself to a special event in jazz history."
4,Schaap and Sony Set You Up,"Who can deny that these performances are among the greatest in jazz history? If you are young and into swing, it is a must listen and a must have. Yet, let's face it, with all the jive about the surface noise versus the music, Sony will ""Someday Sweetheart"" ( to borrow from another BG classic tune ) release this concert again without the snap, crackle, pop ( sorry Rice Crispies ). Then, just as at Burger King, you can have the King of Swing your way! Everybody will be happy! And, Sony and hopefully the artists or their estates will make a whole lotta money again on this classic concert. And, you know what? I'll buy it a fourth time to compare the two like peanut butter. Do you like it plain or crunchy?"
3,"I'm not slamming the music, just the presentation.","While I certainly appreciate restraint in the application of noise reduction methods to old recordings, these discs sound like they -emphasized- the noise. This is quite simply the worst-sounding classic recording on a major label that I can think of. The only way I'm going to be able to enjoy this set is to re-do every track myself to get rid of the LOUD, overbearing, and much-more-'present'-than-the-music noise that overpowers everything."
3,A Classic Performance - A Flawed Recording,"First off, let me say that this performance is one of the most historic in the history of popular music and that we are lucky to have any record of it at all.That being said, it's painful to note that the recording quality of this set is just awful - all the scratches, hisses and pops of the original masters have been reproduced here without even the slightest attempt to clean up the sound.The performance itself rates 5 Stars but this recording rates a 1, if that.Hopefully someday in the future this recording will be cleaned up and made available to the public."
2,A great performance mauled by a disastrous reissue,"I eagerly awaited this reissue, but unfortunately the sound quality is much worse than the previous CD version (which was none too good itself).Producer Phil Schaap says they ""left the noise in"" so as to better reveal the sound of the groups and the hall, a philosophy I generally agree with, but acetates in this condition require some sort of processing just to render them listenable.The relatively overprocessed (and occasionally slightly incorrectly pitched, on the combo numbers) CD release makes the performance far more enjoyable.This could have been one of the great reissues -- I can't believe the label let the producer get away with it."
2,Great Music Bad Disc,"The arrangements are great and compare to the vinyl in content. However, the quality of the disc was totally unacceptable and it was returned for this reason. The tracks without exception had a very, very noticeable ""clunk"" similar to a scratched record. On some tracks it was worse and to the point the music could not be heard.Three of the tracks that were semi-acceptable, including Sing Sing Sing, were outstanding and far exceeded some of the recreations now on the market. The major question is, ""Are all of the CD's of the same poor audio quality as the one I received and returned."""
2,VERY poor sound - Seek the previous release.,"The sound quality on this set should be an embarrasment to the producers. As echoed elsewhere, this pressing is barely listenable. Find Columbia's earlier 2 CD set under the Columbia Jazz Masterpieces series (G2K40244). That set is a wonderful remastering unlike this botched release that sounds as if it was mastered in 1899 not 1999."
1,stop making excuses for the poor sound quality,"I love this concert. have had it for years on cassette. saw the cd and bought it for my car. even with the treble turned down, the popping and hissing is so loud it grates on my ear drums. plain and simple. I buy music to enjoy it, not suffer through it. There is plenty of technology available to remove much of the noise so regular folks can enjoy the music unfortunately, some ""purists"" decided that was unecessary and produced this. My version on tape is over 15 years old and has been played countless times and still sounds far superior to the new cd."
2,Historical Interest Only,"This disc is interesting for historical reasons, but the recording quality is so bad that if want Benny Goodman for listening, you are much better off finding something else."
1,it is NOT COMPLETE,"I was so hopeful to hear the great drum solo of Gene Krupa during Sing, Sing, Sing. It was absent. It's been absent on all the releases I've found since the first release on LP in 1950. I was lucky enough to have that record and unlucky enough to lose my collection. I was very disappointed. I also believe the high range was adjusted to minimize the popping and it doesn't help much. Too much applause time. Where can I return it?"
1,Great music.Poor sound Quality,"I originally ordered this cd set from a well known electronics store.After listening to this cd set on itunes I returned it unopened.These cd's have a LOT of surface noise(crackling,popping and hissing)all over the music on every track,making it,for me,unlistenable.I bought a used 3 cd set of the same concert plus one more disc from a private seller on Amazon.This is the Avid Records 3 CD set.When Columbia Records remastered this set they stated they left all the surface noise on to capture more of the music.All they captured was irritating noise.The difference between these two CD sets is like night and day.The Columbia Records set,now being sold by Sony Music has terrible noise and distortion all over it;while the sound quality of the Avid set is SO MUCH BETTER.This Avid cd set can be downloaded from Itunes.The cd's are now out of print.If you like Benny Goodman you will love listening to the Avid set.Don't waste your good money on the Columbia/Sony set."
2,"Great music, terrible sound, more noise than music",The sound quality is so bad that the cd is useful only for historical purposes. It is not fun to listen to this mess of pops and other noise.
4,Great Jazz,"There is really great jazz on this album. From the beginning of the first track to the end of the last. Each song you candance to, and they are all upbeat and uptempo. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that it is staticy. I guess the recording technology in the 1930s isn't that great. Well, I got to go but if you want some great jazz and good times, buy this album."
5,"Benny Goodman 1938 Carnegie Hall Concert, recent edition","I have listened to thisrecording since its first release on LP in the 50's. This edition is superb and recommended for those who enjoy the mood of a live concert. It is the best of the versions on CD, in my opinion."
3,"Important, but not his best recordings from this era","There's no doubting the tremendous historical importance of this concert, but there's much more to think about before you part with your money. The band are not at their best for much of the first half of the concert and the recording is quite poor - all factors alluded to in the 5 star reviews on this site. The Birth of Swing (1935-36) is a much better place to start your appreciation of Benny Goodman."
5,like a time machine,"I have for years owned and enjoyed the cassette recording of this concert. I never knew that soooo much had been edited out to fit the cassette length. THIS IS MAGNIFICENT, and the price is amazing."
2,A major disappointment,"I should have heeded those reviewers who mentioned all the pops, snaps, and bangs! After hearing the LA Philharmonic cover ""Sing Sing Sing"" at its July 4 2009 pops concert, I decided I must have that music. I wish I hadn't chosen this version because the noise overwhelms the music. I've noted that another, remastered version of this concert is available on CD, and the notes say much of the overriding noise has been scrubbed. My recommendation: go with that version and pass on this one. Fortunately, I didn't pay much for this CD and will simply donate it to a charity."
2,How bad is this one?,"Don't buy this set. Instead find the Avid Cd's which are wonderful. I don't know where the purest were going at Columbia with the quality of the this release. Annoying crackle though out the session at the expense of pure music. The vast majority of listeners will hear the music through devices that limits the fidelity anyway. Ipods, small Cd devices, Automobile CD's etc. Even the original 33's which I shared with my late musician father many years ago were more pleasing than the recent Columbia CD set. Jerry"
2,"Too many snaps, crackles, and pops.","Always a fan of this great album, I was looking forward to a definitive re-issue. The new uncovered tracks (2) and extended Honeysuckle Rose are a treat. However, the incredible amount of hiss and pops make it nearly unbearable. In 'Sing, Sing, Sing', Krupa's intro beat takes a back seat to an orchestra of pops and hisses. 'Swingtime in the Rockies' though is finaly heard without it being muted at the end. Comparing it side by side with the original CD, the fidelity of the recording has improved but at what price? I had so wished to hear a re-issue that would've used the most up to date noise reduction equipment. If you haven't heard a beaten up old record in awhile, then the pops and hisses are, for a great part of the album, incredibly distracting. I'll keep my original copy!"
1,Flawed remastering,"The music is good and of obvious historic interest. Unfortunately, the noise present on this release, the constant hisses, cracks, and pops, makes it unlistenable. Producer Phil Schapp's contention that computerized noise reduction programs compromise the music is ridiculous. Listen to any number of reissues utilizing this technology (e.g., Steven Lasker's work on the Duke Ellington Centennial Edition for RCA)and you will see how great reissues can really sound when done properly. Save your money and skip. If you're curious about this historic event, borrow the CD from your local library. I hope Sony treats future issues of classic music with better respect."
4,"MUSICALLY EXCELLENT, TECHNOLOGICALLY DISSAPOINTING","IT IS NICE TO HAVE IT ALL! FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW, YOU NOW GET THE CONCERT IN REAL TIME. TWO TUNES NOT INCLUDED IN ANY PRIOR ISSUE OF THE ALBUM, PLUS ALL OF ""HONEYSUCKLE ROSE"". YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS CONCERT RECORDING IS A CORNERSTONE OF ANY JAZZ COLLECTION. SO BUY IT ALREADY. COLUMBIA WORKED WITH ORIGINAL ACETATES IN PROVIDING ALL THE MATERIAL, THE ENGINEER MAKES NO APOLOGY FOR THE RECORDING NOISE INHERENT. MY ONLY GRIPE IS THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE. MORE NOISE THAN I WOULD EXPECT WITH TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY."
5,Depooper,"I tried the Depopper program recomended in the previous post, but no way am I going to keep those funked up files. I much prefer the imperfections of the recording. That program may eliminate the pops, but man, now it sounds like canned music inside another can wrapped in tin foil and submerged in a bubble bath. Ok, maybe not that bad, but the music certainly lost depth, and that's less acceptable than some poppage."
4,LOVE the performance--HATE the recording!,This CD sounds like an old phonograph record playing through a $5 speaker in a tin shack during a hailstorm.But the performance itself is a high-water mark for swing music.So there you have it--one of the worst recordings ever made of one of the best jazz performances ever given.
2,Too scratched to listen to,"While I write this message I am listening to the second cd of the set. I am also reading Amazon.com's policy of returns. I am not a purest who wants to find himself sitting in Carnegie Hall in 1938, I just want to enjoy some good CLEAR Benny Goodman music. I will continue to buy this old great music, but I want these reproduction companies to use the most modern sophisticated equiptment they have."
2,Not for the faint of self-assuredness,"I read this book over 20 years ago, and it still stands out in my memory.Certainly some intriguing perspectives and significant insights on human behavior. BUTIf you are already a thoughtful, instrospective individual prone to self-doubt, stay away from this tome of negativity. The drumbeat of potentially negative ulterior motives or unconscious hidden agendas and biases is constant. You'll never trust yourself or others again; or it will take years to ""unadjust"" your ""American"" self."
2,Erasing the magic,"Combine weaker, watered elements from Porcupine Tree and Smashing Pumpkins to equate what kind of sweetness this band robs from."
4,bgmo42,Product works as a replacement for SL20 Streamlight Flash Light. I hope the bulb last as long as the original bulb lasted for me.
2,Way too....,"For the price, I expected something that would last longer than 3 minutes. Something that would last a day at least. Way too soft and it was chewed up by my Pomeranian dogs (one of them only) in 2 - 3 minutes only."
2,Not worth it,For the price it's not worth it. Smaller than I had thought & can't say it did anything to my dogs breath.
4,helpful!,"Highly recommended to any graduate student who wants to handle with discrete dependent variable in his statistical analysis. Authors explain probit, logit, log-linear model... very clearly with many examples supported by their web-site."
4,The best Skinny Puppy album,"I said it, and I mean it. This is their best. Even though there aren't any new songs on here, the way that it is put together... with all the songs flowing beautifully into eachother, makes this CD a better experience than any other Puppy album. If you like Skinny Puppy I would hope that this CD is in your collection, or at the top of your shopping list."
2,Disappointed,The print quality of this book was horrible. A majority of the pictures in the book were not legibile because of the poor print quality.
1,A great disappointment,"I bought this book because I am an avid fan of EL. However, the personality traits and characteristics that work so well in her historical novels DO NOT work in a contemporary novel. Women have changed in the last century, and we definitely have more gumption, independence, assertiveness and self-reliance. Tragic occurrences do not weigh the average woman down - instead we are able to rise above it, and emerge stronger than ever. Reba and Chance do not come across as 20th century people. She is clinging, weak, teary and totally willing to submit to Chance's overbearing, arrogant, chauvinistic, ""I'll take care of everything"" attitude. Give this one a miss, and stick to her later novels. They're much, much better."
3,Loved it!!!!,"I did like Lover in the Rough, I though Chance was sweet and although he was very ""rough"" he was totally in love and I like that in my Heroes...As for the leading lady...she did not take any crap, I like that too...this book was entertaining...."
2,"I usually lover Lowell's work, however",I could not stand this book. There were times that I was just flipping the pages determined to ignore half of the unimportant information. I didn't care for the characters either. Lowell is a fabulous author but this book was not my cup of tea.
2,Not the EL I've come to know and love,"While I won't say this book was a complete waste of my time, it definately was slow on story, and the dialog was really horrid at times. But it still had that heart-wrenching emotion that I've come to associate with all of Elizabeth Lowell's books that I've read so far.So good stuff, but not spectacular."
4,Worth the Read,"Reba Farrall was lost -- until a kindly old gentleman took her under his wing and helped heal her shattered spirit. Now her dearest friend is gone, leaving her with a doubting, broken heart...and half-interest in a California gem mine. But Chance Walker has burst into Reba's life -- a daring adventurer who believes in nothing except the priceless uncut stones for which he searches the Earth. In the blistering heat of Death Valley -- in the intoxicating presence of a jewel more exquisite than any he has ever seen -- Chance must confront a dire peril that stalks the sad and sensuous beauty. For only he can save Reba Farrall from harm -- and only she can teach him how to love."
5,Flirting with disaster and loving it.,"This is an over the top period piece from the sixties or early seventies I would guess.If you've ever been in a relationship where you are undervalued but afraid to burn your bridges you'll enjoy this immensely.Wendy Craig is intelligent, vivacious and caring. Geoffrey Palmer, (who seems to be in most BritComs) the husband, truly loves Ria, but has the worse sense of timing and is always doing the wrong thing. He wants to change but is stuck in his old school chauvanism. Her two sons pour gasoline on the relationship but mean well. Between some very poignant moments, you'll find yourself laughing. Set at the dawn of the women's lib movement, Wendy is torn between being unfaithful with an unwanted suitor and constantly giving her situation another chance. I suspect it could become therapy if viewed with your significant other. Overall, excellent, well done and one of my favorite guilty pleasures."
3,Another Star (Destroyer) Is Born,"I have not put the model together, yet. The only real problem I have encountered is: The instructions are very limited. I really wish that they had been a bit more informative. There is a lot of guessing going on. But, when put together, I will have a Star Destroyer."
3,"no info on this ""destroyer"" is it a toy or a model?","is it a model with customizable detail(as in building it and painting it?) or is it a ""toy"" with little or no detail but durable enough to throw out the window? who knows..."
4,cooking with your eyes,"This is not a book about cooking, but rather a picture book about food, but it is totally amazing! I recommend this book as a great gift idea, for it can sit wonderfully in the living room for everybody to browse. Actually, the book just shows pictures of food ingredients, which could have been dull - but it is laid in a very clean, organized and systematic way, that it just makes you want to swallow the pages."
4,Review for the book,"I bought this book "" Ingredients"", very good and interesting book. Also the book is really new. It's very useful for who are study or interested in food or dietetic."
5,Great Reference Book,This is a great reference book. We have used it many times and I have purchased many copies for gifts. My son just got married and he and his wife are requesting it on their gift registry.
4,I really enjoyed this,"I read this when I was about 13 or 14 and found it to be humorous, poignant and thoroughly entertaining. Now that I'm 30, my tastes may have changed but i remember it fondly. I highly recommend this to its intended age group"
4,Scholarly,This book is interesting and very scholarly. I would love to learn more about Julian. This is not a book for person wanting to read about a general biography but it is a written account of her visions.
2,Boring,"Justin and Marissa's father is a collector of stories. Now he's looking for the Legend of the lost legend. When the siblings follow a dog in the hopes of helping their father in his search, they find a cabin and a strange woman. She sends them on a quest along with the feral boy Luka. If they survive they'll find what they're looking for.This one was just plain boring."
2,Not Great,"Justin and Marissa are camping with their father, a famous writer, in Bravania. Their father is searching for an ancient manuscript known as The Lost Legend.The siblings are adventurous just like their father, and they go off into the forest to help find the treasure. A silver dog leads them to a female Viking, Ivanna. She tells them that they must be tested if they want to find The Lost Legend.This isn't the best Goosebumps book. It has a clever title, but everything else is just predictable, even the twist at the end. If you're a fan of the books, you'll probably still like it, but I don't recommend this to new readers."
1,"Horrid,Stupid,Awful","All the above word describe this book in a nutshell. A dirty rotten nutshell.Justin and Marrissa are in some weird country looking for an ancient manuscript called the Lost Legend. A dog leads them to a cabin in the woods, and naturally the two kids go inside. There they are greeted by a large blonde woman wearing a viking horn helmet named Ivanna. She tells them they have to take test in the Fantasy Forest. And thats the only bit of plot in this book.The rest of the book is one long string of events that make no sense. in short this book is one the worst books I have ever read. The cover sucks too."
4,Seems Good But...,"This is a great bed but the way it's packaged for shipment deforms it. They have it flattened out and in a super tight plastic bag. As you can imagine, they have to fold it in a few places to flatten it out and it causes the bed to become deformed. It doesn't seem to want to ever retain it's original shape as shown in the picture because of this.Also, the picture seems to make it seem the ""pillow"" part of the bed, or the inner cushion, is very fluffy and thick. It is not as it's actually very thin. This causes the walls of the bed to be very tall and it makes the bed look funny. My chihuahua can't lay in it and have a decent view of her surroundings as the walls are enormously high.The quality and the materials of the bed seem top-notch, though. I think these problems I have with it could be solved if they didn't flatten the heck out of the bed for shipment. Again, it doesn't seem to want to go back to it's original form as if it did I would rate it 5 stars."
2,Dog bed feedback,"This bed is advertised as 18"" but I get 15"" at best. It is a nice quality but the cover is not removable. The whole bed is advertised as washable however my experience is the bed will not maintain its shape etc if you can't remove the cover. It has a removable bottom cushion (which I missed in the description) and that becomes another toy for my dog!"
5,Great purchased,I’ve had this bed for about 4yrs and it is of great quality. I put it in washer and drier and have never had a problem. My yorkie loves it!!! The sides stay strong enough and soft enough to lean on.
5,Great bed!,I think the bed for my small dog is great as is. Its has enough padding for her at the bottom and is soft and warm. She went right to it and night as she has been sleeping on our pillows. She doesnt like a lot of padding as she sleeps on the carpet some nights. I'm glad its washable 100%.
5,Great Bed!,"My 7 pound Maltese is very picky. I got her a bed and she refused to sleep in it. When I got her this one, she immediately curled up in it and went to sleep. She pulls the cushion out and often sleeps in the bed without it, or just lays on the cushion outside the bed.I ordered an extra one for her to have at my parent's house!"
2,Not that impressive,"The reviews I read in order to choose this book made it seem like the people who wrote it used the best of the best recipes from regional cook books. This does not seem like the case, however, because most recipes are real hokey, and are only from books representing about 10 states. Some of the recipes are good, but I wouldn't gift it, or anything."
1,Beware - 12 lights less than one,"Just bought this set on clearance sale at Target for $14.95. I'm glad I didn't pay the retail price of $29.95 at Target. Compared to the Dorcy 1 watt LED flashlight and the seven led streamlight flashlight, both of which I own, there is no comparison - the B&D; are the worst. Both my streamlight and the Dorcy provide much brighter light and longer beam of light than these B&D; flashlights. The B&Ds; are also cheaply made compared to the other two.Save your money and get one of the luxeon type flashlights, the 1 watt Dorcy is the best if you can find it, its one of the few that has the on/off button on the side instead of the end which seems typical for the led flashlights."
1,very little detail,"I was naturally hoping for maps with more detail than what I find in the normal family atlas. These maps do not provide that. The only good news here is that the product was quite cheap (for a reason, it turns out), so I was not out a lot of dough. It strikes me as a marketing ploy: a book dedicated to maps of the Middle East, easily created by simply extracting existing maps from the NG family atlas, attracting readers who have a particular interest in the ME. Even tho it was inexpensive, I do feel I got taken."
4,a complete map review,"Both very simple and very complete to understand Today's Middle East boudaries economy and the fight for both oil and water done by each nation.Lots of maps and datas which can be easily unterstooden by foreigners who have an english school level.Made for kids in highschool, university students, teachers and also everybody who tries to understand Middle East by himself.A very good up-to-date."
1,How can they make a mistake like this!,Im a history major and naturally i had to get this atlas for one of my classes. I was happy with it at first until i found that they put Jerusalem and not Tel Aviv as Isreal's capital (shocked). Is it really possible that they did this unaware? I found that to be biased and never bought a national geographic book ever again. I even emailed them and told them to make sure all thier capitals are right!! If they can make that clear 'mistake' then they can easily make other less conspicuous ones.
2,Really wanted some history.,"Well I bought this book becouse there are few books on China's terra cotta wariors. I was hoping for a history lesson with information on China's first emporer who brought about the unification of China and also built the great wall. Instead I got more of Maurice's wierdness. Im all for alt history but this guy goes way to far. He does not ust reach he over extends. With only 183 pages on the terra cotta warriors it was a real disapointment. Dont be fooled by the 300+ page listing. 140 pages of this book are appendixes. It would be OK if these where new and about the terra cotta warriors but the are the same appendixes found in past books. Only one appendix is based on China. Maurice can do better he has a keen mind and if he would stick to just history I think he could be a very credible author,"
1,it should get zero stars,"If you are looking for a good thoery/method book covering ""Jazz Piano"", I suggest Mark Levine's ""Jazz Piano Book"". It is also on Amazon. It covers Penatatonic Scales and much, much more. There are other good books too, but you can't go wring with Mark's.So, this is just another voice telling you not to waste your money on Jeff Burn's book. As other reviewers have noted, the 5 star reviews have got to be either from the publisher, author, or Jeff's mom. The book is pretty much nothing but a scale list."
1,"Zero stars, worthless set of scales","Actually not scales, this consists entirely of a single scale, with some transpositions. This ""book"" is really worthless and I consider it a rip off because of the misleading reviews posted by the author. All the references in other music reviews to this book must be by the author himself. They all have the same exact format.. and no one who had seen this book would recommend it. Save your money."
4,"Good, but not his best","The songs have the signature DMX sound and that, of course, is a compliment. I especially like ""More 2 A Song"" because it tells us about the other side of fame. ""Fame"" and ""Here We Go Again"" are also phat. He gave us a collection of good songs in this album, but they don't top some of the songs on previous albums.But it is worth owning, and that's an understatement."
3,Not a bad album,Party up and good girls bad guys are heavy tunes. The rest is just ok. DMX needs to stop trying to copy Tupac.
4,"Wacky, yet useful","The overall context of this book is supposed to be a report written by a space alien here on earth to observe human learning...well, either you'll think it's cute or annoying. Either way it's only superficial and it does not really detract from the real content. Really, the text covers the basics of learning theories from the early ones to the most recent. It's excellent for those interested in how psychology and teaching meet. Topics include behaviorism and cognitive theories."
5,Best ever from this Skinny Puppy/LPD hybrid,"What could be better. Two of your favorite bands coming together to combine their various talents, and create albums every couple of years.And this album is the best work to date. with songs like ""centre bullet""(which is actually an old SP song from Bites), and the epic ""You and me and rainbows"", this album, in my humble opinion is a silent classic. Those of you lucky enough to locate this album will certainly consider it one of the best CD's you buy all year."
1,Not What It Appears,"Before you buy this wordy, strange tome, check it out at the local bookstore. If you're a gay history buff, this isn't what you're looking for--the title is very misleading. It's a digest of confused essays, the unorganized puffery and random (and very uninteresting) thoughts of the author. I think the desired result was to portray ""hip,"" it succeeded in being boring and tedious. I perused it at the bookstore and passed on it."
2,"A tough, difficult read!","This book is the most difficult challenge to read I have ever undertaken. Suffice to say, the occasional nugget of gay history is buried in a sea of thick, cryptic writing that will have your eyes crossed in no time. Watch for many copies of this book to be featured on the ""used, for sale"" lists VERY soon after purchase."
3,Beatles Picture Disc Mini,"For starters this is a 'mini' disc, not a full size LP. The title bar for the product did not mention this. When I received the disc I went back and reread the description and there it was mentioned. So, it was my fault for not reading everything before buying but it would have been nice if the seller had this information in the title bar.Other than that the disc is fine. Being a mini or seven inch disc I likely would not buy again as all my other picture discs are full size LP's,"
3,The viola with no sound!,"The viola was not in playing condition and had to be taken to a music store to be fixed before it could be played. The bridge was not in place, the packet of silica was broken and in the viola, we were not able to get a sound to play, the bow hairs were falling off, and the the resin was broken in pieces. I was impressed with the expedited delivery of the item, that seemed to be the only positive about the item!"
5,It's Pretty Darn Nifty!,"Ahhh, Sluggy!...This is the first book in the Sluggy universe, where demons are summoned for beer, a mini-lop carrys a switchblade and a glock and your neighbours travel to other dimensions to bring aliens back with them, and well, let me check my notes . . .The writing is sharp, funny, clever, funny, and lots of other words for funny. Sluggy Freelance is compelling, with the neverending storyline that makes you rave more. As Torg and Riff battle and befriend aliens, and try to fight off their pet bunny you become so much a pert of it that you can't let go... This book is bound for a title as not just a comic classic, but a classic comedy/tragedy/soap opera/addictive drug."
4,One of the funniest new comics available in any format.,"When my friends started talking about 'Sluggy this' and 'Sluggy that' I was bemused, but not enough to ask them what it was they were babbling about. My loss--a month later, I had that much more to catch up on. Vampires, Alien secretaries, FBI agents, demons, mad scientists, mad radio show hosts, adorable ferrets... oh, and a guinea pig or something with a knife. This is prime weirdness reminiscent of classic Bloom County."
5,"Read the online comics, then buy the book?","I stumbled across the Sluggy Freelance online (believe or not while looking for Dr. Laura parodies). This is a serial comic that gets much funnier when you read it en-masse.It's sometimes gross, sometimes politically incorrect, but always funny."
5,I have not laughed this hard since my first Python exposure,"Yes, the killer rabbit may be familiar (Holy Grail, anyone?), but he's better than ever in Sluggy Freelance. Bun-Bun the (ka-click!) switchblade packing mini-lop is absolutely a must-see... not to mention the situations his roomies get into, the spoofs, the wordplay, the brilliant observation... ahh. I could go on and on. Visit sluggy on the web and go through the comics from day one to the present, like I did. I *highly* recommend it."
5,A great comic!,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this online comic strip is one of the best comics currently available. Pete Abrams has a knack for coming up with weird, hilarious situations. But Abrams' real strength isn't his ability to ""out-weird"" the other guys, but his finely-tuned sense of humor. Even comics that are part of a series have a (usually very funny) individual punchline. To top it all off, the artwork is excellent.In short: If you like outlandish, funny sci-fi stories (not to mention an extended X-files parody), buy this book. It's worth it."
5,this is how an addiction starts,"Ok, I bought this and read cover to cover in two sittings (I had to get up to go take care of laundry). Before I bought it, I'd already read EVERY Sluggy Freelance online. After I read it, I let my brother and mother borrow it. They are now dedicated Sluggites. My brother gave it to a friend to read.........THE NIFTINESS SPREADS!!!"
5,Wow! What a work of comedic genius,"The sluggy book ""Is It Not Nifty"" Is a delight to read. It is full of quick quips and fast moving action sequences. Kiki, Bun-Bun, and Alie are great additions to the people characters who are just as interesting. Each strip just leaves you wanting more. PICK THIS BOOK UP! YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN!"
5,love me forever,"This is a wonderful book. I never read this author before but I will start buying her work. This is easy reading and I could get into the story. I have a hard time finding authors that I enjoy, I really enjoyed her work. Janet Chapman and Julie Garwood are my favorite authors but now my list is beginning to growSandy from Ohio"
2,Bored to tears!,"While this book starts out in an interesting way it quickly becomes bogged down with boring, tedious, repetitive dialogue. The characters say the same things to each other over and over again. Nothing happens until almost 2/3 of the way into the book. Even then, it is very slow moving and somewhat predictable. I have never read anything else by this author and I probably won't after this. My advice: pass on this one and read something else, maybe something by Jo Beverly or Heather Cullman (just for examples)."
3,Love me Forever,Scottish romance with lots of Scottish history thrown in as a bonus. Donna Fletcher does it well.
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"My house is 17 years old and the garage door handle broke. I couldn't find anything at Home Depot, Lowes etc that matched what I needed. I was surprised to find this item on Amazon and it seemed to match my needs. This price was low so I took a chance and I'm glad I did. It fit perfectly and it actually works better than the original."
5,Should be a movie,I agree with all the reviews written about this wonderful book. This book would make a great movie. Billy's writing is so real that you feel like you are living the story. This is a story that you will want to read over and over.
4,Not Quite As Good As . . .,"the original broadway cast. I loved rachelork's songs but rex smith seemed to not capture the depth of emotion that characterizes Terry mann's Chauvelin. This CD is worth getting if only for Storybook and i'll forget you. my favorite song from the OBC recording, Only love sung b christine Andreas, is not on this album. linda Eder's version is horrible, so definitely get the OBC."
4,Rex Smith cost this a star...,"Oh, how could Pimpy be less than perfect? Well, I'm sad to admit that, while the one I own is the OBC, I have heard this and was unimpressed with Rex Smith (sorry to burst your bubble, people!). Perhaps it was just me (everyone else seems to like him) but I thought he was wholly without emotion on ""Falcon in the Dive"" and ""Where's the Girl?,"" which are songs nobody murders and gets away with it, in my book. (I am involved in theater, so I know the difference between acting when you're singing and just singing when you're singing.) Other than that, the recording is just as good as the other. I ADORE ""I'll Forget You."" That is probably the best song added to the show. But, don't listen to me, make you're own decision."
3,V. DISAPPOINTED,"Okay, I'm sorry, but I was on a road trip with some friends, and we all were listening to soundtracks and singing along. Scarlet Pimpernel came up on the playlist and this was the only version in the car. I was soooooo disappointed. Not that anyone gives a bad performance on this album... I'm just used to the OBC version, which is 100x better! There's noone who can beat Terrance Mann. Doesn't matter how good the new guy is. And I love Christine Andreas as Marguerite! She's so passionate and strong! My absolute favorites from the OBC are not even on this album. It's a watered down version. DON'T BE FOOLED! BUY THE REAL THING!!!!"
4,Terrific!,I am a huge Linda Eder fan and loved her jazzy version of I'll Forget You. When I listened to Rachael York perform the more haunting and chilling verion of it I was breathtaken... I have to say she even beat out Ms. Eder which in my opinion is not an easy task. It is an unbelieveable song. Most of the other recordings were from the OBC but equally as good. Rex Smith's version of Where's the Girl is also excellent. The music in this musical is phenominal!
3,"I love it, but for the wrong reasons...","Am I the only one who finds the music corny, and COMPLETELY overdone? It's great to listen to, but it evokes laughter at the terrible lyrics and overacting. And anytime there is a Peabo Bryson love duet, you KNOW it's corny.I can't appreciate the quality of the music, but I can appreciate how entertaining it is, which is why I give it 3 stars."
1,HORRIBLE... don't buy this book!,"I bought this book, because the concept seemed interesting, and it got great reviews.What a waste of money! The whole book is just whining about a girl he likes, and his parents who don't understand him. GET OVER IT! I don't think I have EVER heard of anyone crying so much. I started out reading and after a couple pages thought, ""Okay, this is a bit boring... but it will get better, right?"" WRONG. Every page was just more of the same ""I'm so depressed.. Why doesn't she love me?.. We could be so happy together... They don't understand me.*emo tears*""If I wanted to read some bitchy teenager's droning I could easily find 1000s of other examples just by logging on livejournal or myspace.And they probably wouldnt be trying so damn hard to actually BE Charlie from Perks of Being a Wallflower."
4,China Bayles mystery?,"First I love the China Bayles series. I will always read each book that comes out starring China Bayles. This book, however, felt and read more like a transition book for China and some of the main characters. The mystery seemed secondary, which is fine for me, I like to see character development. If this had been the first book in the series I had ever read it may have turned me off from reading any others. So if you have not read any other China Bayles books, please start with the first one."
4,Dead Man's Bones,"Albert is up pretty close to her usually standards. Little bit of social commentary on illegal immigration and also on the morality of falsifying your own CV. Overall, a good one."
4,Another good one in a great series,"The Obermann sisters, the elderly remnants of one of the wealthiest families in Pecan Springs, have decided to donate a building on their property to the local community theater group, with one stipulation: They must perform a play written by Miss Jane Obermann that celebrates the life of her father and family founder. But the opening night cast party is brought to an abrupt halt when a shot rings out and Miss Jane Obermann is found holding a smoking gun over the dead body of the local handyman who was apparently breaking into her home, armed with a butcher knife. And China's stepson, Brian, stumbles across a skeleton while exploring a cave, it opens a mystery that is at least 30 years old. China is the only person who sees that the secrets to be found in the dead man's bones will connect the two seemingly unrelated deaths in a way that will shock Pecan Springs to it's very core."
5,dead man's bones,"Though this book got off to a slow start, I feel that ""Dead Man's Bones"" is probably one of the stronger entries into the China Bayles series. China is a little more introspective than most cozy sleuths, which is not surprising since the author is a former English professor. I found the mystery to be pretty interesting after the plot got going, & I particularly liked the Obermann sisters. They command each scene with an ominous presence. My one problem with this series has always been China's best friend, Ruby. She is downright annoying & ungrateful for China's friendship. I would surely never miss her if she disappeared from the series entirely."
3,China seems unhappy,"I guess it only seems to be me based on all the positive reviews but China is just a crank in this book. Impatient all the time even when she needs information from people she is still rude to them. And if her character is supposed to be this close to all these people in her life (i.e., Ruby, Smart Cookie) she doesn't even feel good enough nor they with her, to open up about things going on in their personal life. I'll keep reading but I hope China gets out of this funk she is in. Perhpas that is why the other characters don't want to get into anything with her character because she has been so rude? I don't think it started with this book -- I noticed it the last book as well -- just not as pronounced.The mystery was okay -- predictable for me. I would have been surprised if something different happened."
2,Puzzled,"This is the first China Bayles mystery I've read. I'm somewhat puzzled and dismayed by a couple of things so far (I'm about 1/3 of the way into the book): the abrupt cut-off of Brian's curiosity about some gay men in Massachusetts by his father, and Alana Montoya's reference to the woman who was murdered in Louisiana as a black woman which doesn' have any bearing on the woman's story as it's told. Maybe these issues get brought up again somewhere else in the book, but right now I'm not too optimistic about it. What's going on?"
5,Surprisingly simple and interesting,"I've ended up buying all the books in this series, and it's resulted in some interesting reccomendations popping up sometimes for me.... But this isn't a ""nudie"" book in my eyes. The books are all interesting conversation pieces amoung good friends, everyone finds them interesting. It's such a simple concept that we all wonder about!"
3,Dull and Repetitious.,"I was looking for Spencer Tunick's work, and somehow this book came up in the search instead. I wasn't careful enough looking at the description, comments, etc. So, I ended up buying it.Aside from the disappointment of not getting what I was hoping for, I find this book rather boring and monotonous. Of course, this could have been author's intention to put all the subjects into a similar setting and underline the idea that these are ordinary people from the streets, however this doesn't make these images any more compelling or interesting for myself. I still find the book dull and repetitious. And it was twice the disappointment for myself."
1,Rhis book should never have been published,"The one word that best discribes this book is ""monotonous"" (as defined in Webster's - tediously repetitious, lacking variety). Every image is identical to the previous one, the only exception being the person posing. Save your money buy a book with at least a little variey unless you're an insomniac in neeed of something to bore you to sleep."
2,Scarf smelled,"The scarf was beautifully painted and was shipped promptly. However, it had a flowery smell that wouldn't come out even though I washed the scarf several times. I finally gave it away. People with allergies to floral scents should not buy this scarf."
3,Syncmaster 204T,"I bought 2 of these after many weeks of reading for my G5 Quad that supports 2 monitors.Pros: Bright crisp display, looks wonderfulCons: One has 2 stuck pixels and the other looks as if it has a spick of dirt behind the LCD. Going to try and get replacements."
1,His reputation proceeds him,"Although I have not spoken with him personally, I have reason to believe ""Chris Santana"" is an abusive individual and likely a sex offender. It appears that he is using again even today after his incarceration and AA. I recognized him at a concert in Portland and he was clearly on a bender, it was embarrassing. A sweaty middle-aged man in a suit on drugs. He recently posted an ad on craigslist, offering free hypnosis in exchange for assistance with his online marketing. What a creep."
4,The Art of the Baroque Harpsichord,If you like harpsichord and Baroque music you'll enjoy this CD. I bought it because my son wanted to hear what a harpsichord sounded like. He enjoyed it so much that he'd like to build one and learn to play it. So it was a good investment toward my children's music appreciation.
4,Yes,"Hey who didn't like Lurch and his harpsichord music on the ""Addams Family""? If you like the harpsichord then you will like this."
5,Ty keeps you kicking your boots up song after song!,Quality output song after song. The title song sets the pace for the CD - slow and vibrating. Definitely a CD you'd put in the disk for long hauls cuz short hauls would only leave you wanting to sit in the truck. Like his other CDs STEAM sets the country soul singing. You'll find yourself dancing in the grocery store.
4,A great Cd with some catchy tunes!,"You may have noticed that I gave this CD only four stars. Don't let that faze you--this in an excelent CD. The only problem is pretty much IN A NEW YORK SECOND. Ty Herndon overdoes it a little here. YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR HAT ON is probably my favorite, but I can't believe it's a remake of some older song. It sounds like it's pure Ty Herndon! PRAY FOR ME will leave you in tears, and A LOVE LIKE THAT will have you dancing the night away. Buy this album now, before it turns to STEAM."
3,Cross-over attempt?,"This an obvious attempt at a cross-over album. With Ty's flashy new make-over, he has selected several songs that seem to have no tie to country music. It is a decent album, but not as consistently good as his past albums have been."
3,GOOD MUSIC BAD PERSON,"TY IS A VERY TALENTED MAN, AND HE HAS A GREAT BAND(RIDE THE WEST). HOWEVER THE JUDGEMENTS MADE ABOUT TY NOT GETTING THE DESERVED ATTENTION IS TOTALLY FALSE INFO. I HAPPEN TO KNOW TY, HIS BAND, AND CREW. HE IS NOT AS SENSERE AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO BELEIVE. HE IS SELF CENTERED AND ARROGANT. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HIS BAND, CREW, FANS, OR SONG LYRICS. HIS ONLY CONCERN IN LIFE IS MONEY AND HIMSELF. GET A GRIP PEOPLE, DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE UNLESS YOU KNOW THEM! JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FAMOUS DOESN'T MEAN THEY DESERVE IT, IF HE GETS WHAT HE DESERVES HE'LL BE SLINNING FRIES AND MCDONALDS FOR A CAREER SOON!"
5,"Detailed, understandable, thorough and fun!",I think this must be one of the best UNIX-manuals ever written. Mr. Hahn shows skills and knows how to teach even a beginner everything from basics to the more advanced. I would highly recommend this book to everybody who would like to learn a bit or eight about Unix- The most interesting and powerful MUOS there is!
4,"As said, a student's guide","For a Windows 95 user like myself, Unix looked liked a dark and mysterious night, unpenetrable and unfathomable. This book came like a guiding light and saw me through."
2,There are better choices,"Mr. Hahn's approach is a fun-and-games, gee-whiz approach. It's terminally lightweight. Many was the time I was poring through its pages (it was a textbook in one of my early programming classes), trying to figure out how to accomplish a specific task, only to be faced with a cutesy story (""The Programmer and the Princess"") or a worthless tip (""Hint: Spool is cool."") Overall, I felt that this book tried much too hard to be ""hip"", at the expense of actual content. I sold it back at the end of the quarter."
3,A Pleasant Diversion,"This is a fun piece of fluff entertainment. The many obvious plot points are so secondary to the actual fun, that nothing is ruined. A world of pretty people, hot sex, hair products and easy-to-solve crimes = an entertaining couple of hundred pages. If that's what you're looking for, this will certainly fit the bill."
1,"Terrible MP3 CD, terrible packaging","I was not at all happy with my recent Audio MP3 CD purchase of The Prince. Firstly, the packaging was shotty at best, nothing professional about it. Looks like some dude made this in his garage with a blank cd and an inkjet. Secondly, a few of the tracks didn't even work, for example #2, and #19. As well, at least 2 other tracks were only 5 seconds long. I would recommend staying away from this product and save your money."
3,Buyer Beware: its an old english translation of classic works,"This is the real deal and you will get both of Machiavelli's excellent works translated in Old English which makes it a huge pain to read. If you are into that sort of thing, then go for it, but I am not."
5,If you want to see the Prince in action...,"The Prince is a 'how to' book for evil Princes - and if you don't believe me, read your history.One of the best books I read after this one was about the family that Machiavelli consulted for and wrote these books for and about, the Borgia's.Check it out:Machiavelli's Disciple: The True Story of the Borgia PopeYou will be astounded!"
2,this book is difficult to read,"This book is written in archaic English. It is difficult to read because, over time, spelling, syntax, word meaning and sentence structure have changed. In addition, most sentences are very long with many sub clauses.The publisher does not identify the translator, nor is the date of translation given. I suspect was translated around the 1600's.If you enjoy untangling long complicated sentences using words that may not mean the same thing as today, have fun."
5,the greatest backlash!,"mariah has a really great voice and she carried of them extremely well, thank god i found you is a great song and heartbreaker is wonderful and after tonight, can't take that away, crybaby, against all odds, petals and bliss are surprises"
4,One of a kind,"I like the songs ""heartbreaker"" and ""Thank God I Found You"". Great videos too. But this CD is truly one of a kind - unique - where else can you find white pretty-boy band 98 degrees and gangsta rappers like Da Brat and Snoop Doggy Dogg on the same CD? Mariah is simply amazing - 15 Billboard number one hits in just 11 years, now that ""Thank God"" is the new number one song in the nation. Keep up the good work, Mariah!"
5,a personal album,"this is a personal album but one of my favorites, this album was one of the best by mariah, her songs are heartbreaker and cant take that away, and of course the remake of against all odds, but my favorite is Cant take that away, and the reason why i love this song so much is because it gives me alot of hope, it makes me feel good about myself, this songs i believe is really for different people, I am gay and i dont always get accepted, but i do love this song, and the whole album, so if u know ur different or struggling with something, but this album for sure, it helps u deal with it in a great way, i love you mariah, must own"
4,One More Step to the downfall of her Career,"Well, how can I say this politely...Since her so-called transition to Hip-Hop, millions of her fans were lost..Probably 7 million of them didnt like her ""new-style."" Now only die hard fans of Mariah buys this album...And in my own opinion Sony just shipped 3 million copies of Rainbow to maintain her Triple Platinum Status...Face it all Mariah Fans, she's getting closer to her downfall.But in this album she also proves once again that she is a great writer and also that she can deliver more #1 songs, she has two from the Rainbow album right now, but I also like, no I don't think that's the word for it I LOVE the Mariah's Theme and After Tonight...songs like Crybaby with Snoop Dog and How Much with Usher and the Heartbreaker Remix is definately what most of Mariah's old fans want, especially me!Feel free to e-mail meeh if u disagree or agree with my review!"
3,NOT AS GOOD,"Mariah Carey has a great voice, but ""Rainbow"" is far inferior to her other albums. The only songs I like are Heartbreaker and the remix."
3,Too many voices for one artist...,"This is not Mariah's finest hour. Now, I can understand Ms. Carey wanting to share the limelight with a pal or two on the CD. Variety IS the spice of life, after all, but nearly EVERY song is a duet or a combo vocal of some sort. The reason I started buying MC albums is for her superb voice that, while it has mellowed a little since she was younger, still has a beautiful sound to it. Which brings me to the next problem. I love ballads and I hate rap. This CD is more street and less lovesongs by a long shot than, say, ""Daydream"". So I guess if you like the street sound and rap music, then this is the album for you. If not, then you still may want to buy this disc for a few gems like 'Petals'. My fond hope is that Mariah will go back to her roots and back to singing (and writing) the songs that made her a sensation in the first place. I think it would be a shame if I had to stop buying her albums. Waiting breathlessly for the next album to find out..."
3,Mmm...its ok...a tad disapointing,"What is with all the hype for Rainbow? It's an ok album, but its not her best. What is she trying to do, is she trying to be Britney Spears? Just look at the album cover, it doesnt even fit the music on the cd, and the insert in the booklet, what is she modelling for Victoria's Secret?The songs are ok. It has it's strong moments, such as Petals, Heartbreaker, Thank God I Found You and Against All Odds, but the rest usually gets skipped over. X-Girlfriend sounds like a rip off of TLC's No Scrubs and it also sounds like Destiny's Child's Bills Bills Bills. Mariah is trying to be too hip hop, and this album is way too obssessed with heartbreaker (ie Heartbreaker, Heartbreaker remix and Vulnerabillity Interlude, which is just a stupid heartbreaker song.)Save your money, get a better MC cd like Butterfly or Daydream."
2,Weak,"I was so excited about this new CD, because, let's face it, the girl can sing. However, this latest effort doesn't begin to show off her vocal talent. There's only 2 good ones on here: Heartbreaker, even if it does sound just like fantasy and Crybaby. Don't waste your money!"
2,medicore,"The album cover alone looks so freakin' stupid. And her behind is airbrushed with the rainbow logo. Stupid. As she gets older she looks and acts younger. Also, her songs don't have any meaning unlike Madonna's music. Mariah's music sounds the same. Oh I'm in love and than I'm out of love. And then songs about shaking your booty. I'll lean toward Madonna anyday cuz her sound is always changing and Madonna can dance, she can play the guitar, she writes her own music, and there's a lot of artistic meaning in her songs."
5,after the rainbow!,"buy this terrific art by mariah, she song great! just watched the celine dion's concert telescast on tv, though she is good, but no one can actually compare with mariah's great vocals!"
5,great vocals!,"greatest vocals i ever heard, her 5 octaves vocals is the most stunning thing abt her..CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY & THANK GOD I FOUND YOU ! the real chart-topping hits"
1,Mariah ya nos es lo que era,"He sido fan de Mariah Carey durante casi 6 años y durante este tiempo me he podido comprar todos sus discos. Hasta ahora... ""Rainbow"" será el primer disco de Mariah que no compraré. Lo he escuchado y no vale la pena. Antes hacía buena musica pero ahora ha perdido todo el encanto. Por mi parte, he de decir que ha perdido a otra fan."
5,The Best CD Ever!,"1. Heartbreaker- Awesome song with Jay-Z. Fun lyrics.2. Can't Take That Away- Beautiful song and inspiring lyrics.3. Bliss- Great song with alot of high notes.4. How Much feat. Usher- Wonderful song with alot of Bass.5. After Tonight- Pretty song with a spanish flavor.6. X-Girlfriend- Cool song with a good beat. Cool lyrics.7. Heartbreaker Remix feat. Da Brat and Missy Elliot- I Don't like it. Rappy.8. Vulnerability (Interlude)- Easy listening, but very short song.9. Against All Odds- My favorite. Very sincere and beautiful.10. Crybaby- Cute song feat. Snoop Dogg. Cool lyrics.11. Did I Do That?- Cool song with strange but fun lyrics.12. Petals- Beautiful song with meaningful lyrics.13. Rainbow- Pretty song with great words. Very good.14.Thank God I Found You- Pretty song with great lyrics. Featuring 98 Degrees and Joe.This is an awesome CD with many great songs. Lyrics are included, and a great picture of her inside as well. If you like R&B, you will love this CD."
2,Not really enough here to bother with,"I really like Mariah's voice and I enjoy most of her songs, but I was disappointed in this album. There's too many of those silly little ""interludes"" (code for half-a$$ed effort to take up space on the album without actually making the effort to create an original song). One thing I *did* enjoy was the tie-in with Snoop Doggy Dogg's ""Doggy Style"" album - I have that album, too, so I thought it was funny. I liked the ""Heartbreaker"" song (both versions) but the best song on the album has to be ""Crybaby"". I loved hearing Mariah & Snoop together. Great collaboration on that one!"
2,Boring.....,"She sounds like every other singer on this album. She sounds soft... not using her strength in most of the songs... expect few of course. Soft singers don't appeal to me as much as strong ones. This album also sounds rushed in the making, like they didn't spend enough time on it. I know for a fact it only took 3 months to record.. and it DOES sound like it. But.. her lyrics are OOOOOk.. and that is why she only deserved 2 stars!"
5,VERY GOOD ALBUM WITH A VERY GOOD MESSAGE,"THIS ALBUMS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE HEARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, ALTHOUGH WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY ABOUT IT AND HER VOICE FOR ME IN EVERY MARIAH CD I HAVE FOUND NEW FACETS ON MARIAH'S VOICE, AND MARIAH'S WRITTING, EVERY ALBUM IS TOTALLY DIFERENT FROM EACH OTHER SO DON'T ESPECT THE SAME OF THE OTHER ALBUMS, IT'D BE BORING, SO THIS TIME MARIAH SHOWS UP WHAT SHE IS AND HER VERSATILITY DOING AND WRITTING SONGS. IN THIS ALBUM YOU CAN REALIZE THAT SHE'S A REAL GIRL AND HAS AS MANY PROBLEMS AS WE HAVE, AND SHE EXPLAINS PERFECTLY HOW SHE'S GOTTEN THROUGH THEM, IN VERY DIRECT WORDS AND WITH THE PERFECT MUSIC. SHE DEFFINITELY HAS GROWN UP, AS A PERSON AND AS A MUSICIAN. FROM HEARTBREAKER TO THANK GOD I FOUND YOU, YOU FIND A RAINBOW OF SOUNDS AND STYLES SO THAT IS WHAT RAINBOW IS FOR, TO SHOW THAT EVRYTHING THAT'S DIFERENT CAN BE UNITED AND UNDERSTOOD AS ONE SINGLE THING. SO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE REAL MESSAGE IN THIS ALBUM."
5,I'm a HUGE FAN,"Mariah Carey has made a HUGE comeback. Not only do all the guys thinks she's hot, all the girls in my school walk down the hall singing ""Heartbreaker"" and other awesome songs. The remix was great, Mariah and Da Brat and Missy Elliot make a great combo-I was doubting that at first. I've listened to the whole CD some many times already-It's GREAT! Go out and buy this CD and see for yourself-I am now a huge fan of Mariah."
4,Recommeded only to Mariah's FAN,"I purchased this album immediately after it came out on the first day. After listening to all the tracks, I noted that the album is about the same as Butterfly album. Although, there are tracks like Thank God, Mariah's Theme and After Tonight that I personally like, the others are quite dull. The faster tracks that i like is Crybaby and Heartbreaker. This album is recommended if you are truly Mariah's Fan"
2,The Same Ol' Mariah,"You can hardly differentiate between this new album and ""Butterfly"". It's kind of boring at one end and average at the other. Though Mariah changed her line of producers (like there's not a single trace of long-time-Mariah-producer Walter Afanasieff on this album), she is successfully unable to bring herself up musically (again!). There are pretty much the same old ballads and hip-hop-sounding songs. The outstanding songs from the album would be ""Heartbreaker"", ""After Tonight"", ""Petals"" and ""Thank God I Found You"". And too bad the remake of ""Against All Odds"" turns out to be an average song unlike her powerful ""Without You"". Really, she should've done an EP rather than an LP... and dressed up a lil' bit!"
4,It was good but not her best work,"Rainbow was a fairly good but it was not one of her best works. Heartbreaker and the remix were really good. So was Petals and X girlfriend. Those were her strongs songs along with "" Against all Odds"". But otherwise some of her ballads were pretty weak."
3,Good so far,So far this cd is pretty good. I think Mariah does better on her own and the cameos only bring her down. Butterfly was a much better cd. What happened? So far I request Ex-Girlfriend. :)
3,"Clothes please, Mariah!","Mariah has a lot of talent, and she sounds great in the album...Her slow ballads are good, but Heartbreaker is SOOO repetitive! A lot of the songs sound like repeats off old albums...as for Mariah herself, she looks ridiculous without any clothes on and makes her look trashy. Come on, Mariah, stop trying to sell your body..."
3,Good for its singles,"Mariah Carey possesses a singing ability almost bar none to any other performer today. Most of her albums showcase her extraordinary vocalizing, but Rainbow is one of her most irresistible in terms of ear candy and consistency. Like all of Carey's many records that contain filler Rainbow does not miss out, and there are a handful of tunes here that seem to be just there for the sake of being there. But Mariah seems to have loosened up on songs about heartbreak, or at least making them more upbeat (as heard in ""Heartbreaker,"" a brilliant piece of pop and R&B). Rainbow opens and closes brilliantly, but like its predecessors contains a good amount of filler, although ""Mariah's Theme"" and ""Petals"" are decent. Overall, a little more than mediocre, but Mariah has yet to learn how to put together a listen that's more consistent than vocally amazing."
2,only a few good songs,"Being a fan of Mariah Carey, I was very excited when her new cd came out, but when I finaly got to hear it, I was very dissapointed. There are realy only 4 good songs on the cd, Heartbreaker, X-Girlfriend, the re-make of Phil Collins' Against all odds, and Thank God I found you, with 98 degrees. Otherwise this cd is one of the worst yet, by Mariah. I think that her previous cds were much better."
4,The Queen of Pop's #1 Album,"THIS is my fav album from Mariah. It's sooooo superior to ""Butterfly"" in every way. ""After Tonight"" is a classic Mariah ballad that should of been a single. ""X-Girlfriend"" is an amazing ""catfight"" song. ""How Much"" is one of Mariah's more successful flirtations with hip-hop. MARIAH IS THE BEST!!"
3,Unique Review,"Well, well, well. What has Mariah gone and done now? This album is alright but I'm used to the old Mariah, with a majority of ballads and pop songs. But now she has decided to change her style to and R & B style with a touch og hip-hop.This new style is alright because she's got the voice to sing anything but I just need to get used to hearing her like this.Overall the album has got some good songs and I must admit she does come back with a few songs in her old style which shows she did not totally trensform.My favourites are the songs with snoop and Joe with 98 degrees.If you like Mariah you will want this but if your not a big fan be cautious cause you might get a big surprise."
5,stunning performance,Against All Odds is one great song that Mariah remake! her vocal strength is still as strong though she sound really subtle in the beginning of the song!
3,"Good, but not Great",Rainbow is pretty good. There are some songs that is really like. But the rest of the songs have the same kind of tune and feel. There isn't much variety. It's not as good as some of Mariah Carey's other CDs.
3,"Well, it was okay...","Yes, this has been said before, but the majority of Rainbow is like Butterfly. Mariah's testing her hip hop schemes, and it doesn't quite sound right with her high-octave slurs with gruff rappers in the background. The CD was nice and lengthy, even with two interludes, but don't buy into the Mariah hype for the album, becuase it's not worth it. Still, if you're a really big Mariah fan, go ahead and splurge on it."
3,Mariah where are your clothes?,"Beautiful Mariah Carey started to change her music and whole image here and it's really sad because she does not need to loose all the clothing her ""voice"" sells her music. I do not prefer her downward trip to R&B/Rap , I love her ballads what she is known for and upbeat inspirational tunes. This album has a ""few"" great songs whereas the others are just okay. I hope one day soon the ""old"" Mariah will come back to us!"
4,Nice!,"""Rainbow"" is probably Mariah's most diverse CD. It mixes pop, R&B, and rap well (most of the time). My favorite songs are: Thank God I Found You (a brilliant ensemble song; 98 degrees and Joe are very smooth and talented singers and complement Mariah well), X-Girlfriend (a catchy song produced by Shekspear, who did most of the Writing's On The Wall CD for Destiny's Child), and Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme--it has a great message). The only song that I don't particularly care for is ""Did I Do That,"" featuring Master P. Actually, it's a sample from one of his songs. It just doesn't go well with Mariah's voice. Overall, I would recommend this CD for extreme Mariah fans and fans of R&B and hip-hop. For people who are fans of the older Mariah (1990-1996), you may not care for this too much if you didn't like Butterfly; there are probably only a few songs you'd like."
3,an undesirable turn of Mariah's music.,"In an attempt to catch new fans and update her sound Mariah Carey has turned to R&B/hip-hop tunes instead of soul. This is really an undesired turn. Her music is a lot less meaningful and fun to listen too anymore. Rainbow, which isn't half bad (but not half good either) is Mariah's weakest album and I rarely play it. However, she has stayed true to her barings with songs like Can't Take That Away, Thank God I Found You and Against All Odds. Other than that, All songs fall somewhere between Heartbreaker, the best of the hip-hop and some really bad excuse for hip hop."
2,What ARE you doing Mariah?,"Listen to some Mariah's earlier album, then listen to this. If it wasn't for the unmistakable voice you would have thought they were different artisits. Alot of the songs on this album are r'n'b/hip-hop based (How much,x-girlfriend,Heartbreaker). I'm not sure sure if you she should be going down this road. I much prefer her singing just ballads and pop/r'n'b types like 'Fantasy' and 'Honey'. Some songs on here are Mariah like 'Petals' and 'Can't take that away'. But i'm sure hoping she ain't gonna go completely hip-hop and lose her originality."
3,Its Okay...less than I expected though,"Personally, I think Butterfly was her best album yet. It had its mix of BOMB! r&b (breakdown), perfect ballads (butterfly and whenever u call), and nice dance songs....now Rainbow, i expected to be better than that, but everything seems kinda ""recycled"". They all sound the same as other songs that have been done before. THE ONE THING THAT I LOVE MARIAH FOR THE MOST was her beautiful (sounds gay, but oh well) songwriting...this one is lacking it, seriously. Only one song, Petals, which is good, is what i expected from a mariah song. To me, she didnt prove anything with this one, only the fact that she basically like any other artist. I used to put her on a pedastool, now she is just standing on a small phonebook :) cameron"
3,She Needs Tommy Back in her life,"Mariah, Mariah, Mariah. It was okay to divorce Tommy, but she should have kept him in her life to save her music. It seems like she is just making albums to make money. That's not the Mariah we use to know and love, She use to care about making music. Tommy, she needs your help. He may have been controlling, but he knew what he was doing as far as her music was concerned."
1,Keep Your Money!,"This cd was bad on all levels. The cd artwork and the bad songs make me question what I ever saw in Mariah Carey in the first place. I cannot recommend this cd to anyone. The song ""Against All Odds"" is ok, but that's about it."
1,heartbreaker...,"ok, the song heartbreaker is a decent pop disco song...but all the other songs are unbeliavably uninspired...and by this time, mariah leaves the romantic monogamic naive girl attitude and became a....heartbreaker! She is really beautiful but her songs are really fake and the lyrics are embarassing...."
5,Best Yet!,"Some people are disappointed that Mariah doesn't keep doing songs like, ""Hero"" and so on, or that'd she would stick to white music (i.e., pop) and forget about her African-American side (i.e., R&B, hip hop). For those of you who have forgotten and think Mariah doesn't do R&B well, Vision of Love was a number one R&B song (by the way, six of her 14 number one's have been number one R&B songs, including Heartbreaker.)I hope Mariah continues to do her thang and forget about her ""fans,"" white music critics and company. There are plenty of people like me, her REAL fans, who love to see her change and grow.Rainbow, without Walter A., is her best yet, in my opinion."
4,A lot of uptemo groove with some ballads but a great album!,"Mariah has done it again! Her album is so good! I love it ""Heartbreaker"" and ""How Much"" with Usher are the best. I loved it I would give is 200%. She's really tight on her R&B/hip-hop grooves. Everybody love Mariah and I love her too!"
2,I WAITED ALL THIS TIME FOR THIS!,"WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT, I HAVE ALL OF MARIAH'S CDS, MY FAVORITE BEING BUTTERFLY, BUT WHAT HAPPEND? THIS ALBUM LIKE OTHERS HAVE REVIEWED HERE IS SO WEAK! I HAD TO LISTEN TO THIS CD, A TOTAL OF FIVE TIMES, TO MAKE SURE I WAS LISTENING CORRECT. THIS ALBUM HAS SO MUCH FILLER, I ACTUALLY HAVE TO SKIP THRU THE CD, INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO EVERY SONG, LIKE I HAVE WITH HER PREVIOUS WORK. HEARTBREAKER WAS OK, BLISS, CRYBABY WITH (SNOOP DOGG), AND THE EMOTIONAL HONESTY IN PETALS ARE OK, NOT GOOD, BUT ARE OK. IT SEEMS SHE DID A RUSH JOB DURING THE MAKING OF THIS DISC.I HEARD HER SAY IT TOOK HER 3 MONTHS TO DO THIS ALBUM, IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE THREE DAYS, ESPECIALLY THAT SILLY SONG X-GIRLFRIEND, CMON MARIAH, U ARE NOT BRITNEY SPEARS! I LOVE MARIAH BUT SHE SHOULD HAVE WORKED A LITTLE HARDER ON THIS DISC, INSTEAD OF DOING A RUSH JOB, SO PEOPLE COULD BUY THIS FOR THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS."
4,back again,Forgot to add that this cd showed how mariah was during this past year.For that i think it's a great cd
2,The Web Clips are Better Than the Actual Songs!,"Though I knew she had changed her style, I was sure that I would still love the cd. I was a little disappointed! I couldn't take listening to some of those songs. This was more of a shocker, than Whitney's MLIYL. The disappointment was greater, and that's too bad because Mariah prepared us for her new style/music change with Butterfly. This isn't such a great comeback to Butterfly! I hope she learns her lesson and do a better job!"
3,Disappointing for a diva...but we'll live...,"Mariah Carey has a great voice and talent, no doubts about that. A true diva indeed. However, with this album she lacks the power that she shows in her former albums (though once in a while she gives us snippets of that power) and she seems to deviate from her original style which we have learned to love. Yet from the words of the songs she writes (and the fact that she calls it a chronicle of her emotional roller-coaster ride during a period in her life), it can be seen that this album is her attempt to develop into other fields of music. Though the foundations of this development is somewhat shaky, it is also a commendable effort. The mix of R&B and Hip-Hop with Mariah's sound is somewhat hard to digest but will grow on you eventually. Though will expect more from the Diva in future."
5,It's Great!,"I thought that mariah's new cd, Rainbow, is really good. Her songs have different yet incredible rythms. Most of all her songs are very good, but my favorite is Bliss. Bliss, to me, seems like ""Breakdown"" but in a different way of course. She is definetely in love and not heartbroken. Most of the songs on here are pretty much ballads but they are still great. All of the songs, including the interludes, on this album are great and I love to hear them over and over again. I am very glad that I bought this cd when it first came out!"
3,didn't get to hear it!,"i only rated this cd 3 stars because i didn't get to hear the cd play correctly online,but i'm pretty sure if the cd would've played correctly online,like it was suppose to.It would have received more stars than what i havegiven it."
5,she covered the sky with her songs,"i love can't take that away and thank god i found you, the lyrics is beautiful, adn the music is great and also mariah's singing is superb! rainbow album is the best gift i ever received !"
3,It could of been better,This album wasn't that great in my opinion. I liked daydream and music box more.
4,"""RAINBOW"" is pure magic","i think that a lot of people have biased opinions about this album. i thought that mariah's vocal skills weren't wasted on this album. i think she came on strong, especially in ""Against All Odds"" And though this wasn't as good of an album as ones like Emotions or Butterfly, I felt it was a really astonishing effort. i especially liked ""Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)"" and Rainbow Interlude. I felt the lyrics were good and her voice came on strong, and to add even more to it there were great guests on it (Dabrat, Joe, 98 Degrees, Jay-Z, to name a few) Also listen to ""Bliss"" to hear that great voice of hers shine through."
4,Better than the rest of her stuff,"This cd is actually pretty good. Mariah tends to have several songs on each of her cds that just don't grab my attention. This cd is different. Most of the songs are very good. Her best songs are probably ""Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)"" and ""Thank God I Found You"". The ""Heartbreaker"" remix and a few other songs have a little too much edge for this cd. It seems like she might have wanted to put a little more uplifting songs in in place of the rapped songs. That way it would continue the rainbow that she wishes to share with her audience."
2,Enough is Enough....I' m disappointed with mariah again,"I used to collect all her cd's but she has been going down hill since the past few years. What's with her music and style these days. The Cd was just not enjoyable, I'm not going to lie to you, just because i'm a fan. im so disappointed with her, and Im not going to take it anymore. This one goes back to the store. sorry mariah but you're not treating your fans too well and when you come back Perhaps I will listen properly to the cd, before buying. it's just not doing it for me anymore. her voice has changed and its harsh and needs training. On 'against all odds"" her voice was hardly make it to the high notes, it was struggling, and i think that was the best attempt on the album. All the rapper stuff is trite. terrible. whats with her these days. until she can prove to me something else i won't be buying. enough is enough.I'm so let down and disappointed with this album. :("
3,Mariah does it again--but not as well,"This is Mariah Carey's worst work. However, it's still prety good. Unfortunately, there aren't any songs that ould really become classics like Fantasy or One Sweet Day. However, I love Thank God I Found You and Heartbreaker is pretty good too. X-Girlfriend is ok, but most of the other songs are redundent and mediocer. Try Music Box if you want Mariah at her best. Or if you like it a little hip hop influenced but not as overwhelming as Rainbow, Butterfly is great too."
5,Mariah is great,"This album, while a little too hip hop, is still worth the money. ""They Can't Take That Away"" and ""Against All Odds"" are worth it by themselves!"
4,A rebirth for Mariah,"On Rainbow, Mariah Carey tries to prove that she can pull off R&B and Hip-Hop--and go light on the pop. She does this with mixed results. To accomplish this, she enlists help from everyone from Jay-Z and Missy Elliott, to Joe and Snoop Dogg. Her best Hip-Hop efforts are ""Cry Baby"", the ""Heartbreaker"" remix, and ""How Much"" with Usher. But fans of her ballads should take note of ""Can't Take that Away"", ""After Tonight"", and her remake of Phil Collins' ""Against All Odds"". The interludes are a bit annoying, however. If you're a Mariah fan, you'll see this album is different from her others. She brances out, but not always successfully. Good effort, though."
5,Mariah Carey is the Bomb,This is a great album. Probably her best. And Just this month I went to see her in concert in San Jose. She was the greatest. There's nothing like hearing her voice live. She is the greatest. Buy the album
2,Rainbow is a WEAK album,"i downloaded the new album by mariah carey (yes it's already out there)and i must say its the weakest album she has ever made. Her best is behind her. The strongest tracks are heartbreaker and petals. Heartbreaker, because it has the srtongest groove and most memorable chorus on the album (and that doesnt say much) and Petals, for it's upfront honesty, and gentle fragility. Other than those strongpoints, the rest of the albums lyrics, production, and melodies are increbily tired and lagging. It seems mariah thinks this is her best work ever, unfortuneatly for her fans, and even thiose that wish she would gain some artistry and try new directions, there is barely a single moment on this album that you will enjoy."
1,I DID NOT LIKE IT,"I'm sorry but I have been a fan of Mariah's for over 13 years and have her entire collection, but this one is pretty bad. There are maybe 2 songs here that I can listen to and they are ""Can't Take That Away"" and ""Against All Odds"". I don't know what happened here. There is nothing wrong with collaborations, but please! There is too much going on here! I NEVER listen to this and the only reason I bought this was because I have been listening to Mariah since 1990, but something changed for the worse. I don't know-but I much prefer ""Daydream"" to this."
4,4 Stars for the rushed Mariah,"I don't really get why she put some rejected Destiny's Child songs on here. ""X-Girlfriend"" is a little teenager song that I don't like. This album is a solid 4 stars. I think that her vocals were still impressive on this album. With the song ""Bliss"" during the chorus/hook, she sings it in high notes. That's actually my favorite song on this album. Anyway, if you're a Mariah fan, then buy it."
2,It corny for me!,"This album is came out when i was a young kid and I thought it was ok. I didn't think anything was too speial about this. I think the concept of this album is way too corny and the ballads are way to sleepy. Compared to alot of her other work I think Glitter and Charmbracalet are alot better. Heartbreaker, boring. I can't really think of the names of the other tracks. i did think her ballad with joe was pretty decent. Other then that she has releasded alot better stuff then this."
3,I love her underwear!!!,she deserved Pop Colaboration with Vocals (Thank God I Found U) and Rap/Sung Collabo (Heartbreaker) @ the Grammys!!!
3,Mariah's Worst Effort,"Don't waste your money on this CD! Usually a blind purchase of Mariah material is rewarding. However, ""Rainbow"" is an exception. This CD can be rated mediocre at best. She proves that she is still in need of creative input from her estranged Sony husband. The CD has a few bright stars. They include ""Crybaby"", ""X-Girlfriend"", and ""Can't Take That Away"". The remainder of the songs were merely average or simply fell short of Mariah's old standards. If you just have to have this CD just because it's Mariah, I highly recommend purchasing it at a discounted rate i.e. USED, etc.."

3,"Not her best,but solid","I have been a fan of Mariah's since the beginning.Although this new album is not as good as her previous work,I think there are enough good songs to keep one's attention,if you are a Mariah fan.I think the songwriting on this album is a little ""typical R&B"",and I definitely think her past ballads have been stronger.All in all,I don't regret buying the album.I would also like to give her props for continuing to co-write and co-produce her own music.That alone separates her from MOST female r&b singers."
3,Okay,Mariah could do better on her ballads and really let this album go in the bad directrion but still worth the money as long as you pay under 16 bucks.
5,Mariah does it again!,"Ever since I found out that Mariah Carey was releasing another CD a few months ago, I have been greatly anticipating the release of her 9th CD, Rainbow. After buying the CD the day it was released, I can happily say that I have never been so impressed with one of her CD's! Weither it is one of her powerful and emotional ballads, or a new r&b number, this CD should satisfy all of Mariah's devoted fans. I feel that each song on Mariah's CD has touched me, especially ""Mariah's Theme,"" which I feel in the future will be her 15th #1. I have been a devoted fan of Mariah's since day one and in my opinion, Mariah has done it again with another fabulous CD!"
3,it's not as good as her other albums,"um..all i have to say is that this album is not that good......the only good songs to me are "" can't take it that way"" "" after tonight"" and "" thank god i found you"" ......this albums shows that mariah carey can't not sing that well anymore...she said"" track #12 is her fav song because it is the most emotional song that she've ever recored and it took one step further than "" close my eyes"" in butterfly""......have you guys heard "" close my eyes"" ? all the notes are so high and the petals' notes are lower .....and she said it took one step further? maybe she think it did but NO! i am a mariah carey fan but ...this album is just not that good ...i am very disappointed :("
4,Good Album,"I have been a fan of Mariah Carey's ever since she came out. Contrary to popular opinion, I love her ability to hit high notes! Not too many other artists can do that. Although Rainbow is not her best CD, it's still good. I like old and new school Mariah, so everything she does is chill with me. However, if you are strictly a fan of old school Mariah, this one is not for you! Those who like Hip-hop Carey will love this one and everything she has done from Butterfly on for that matter. For me, Rainbow's highlights include: Bliss--a beautifully light, soothing piece of soul perfection and the best track on the album in my opinion; After Tonight--a solid adult contemporary song; Against All Odds--nice rendition of a Phil Collins classic; and Heartbreaker(The Remix)-- great hip-hop cameos.If you're looking for something with less hip-hop, I would check out her first self-titled album, Emotions, Daydream and Music Box."
5,she never lets me down...tears each time...,"Yes, Miss Carey had fun on her CD cover, but she deserves it, and the happy pictures of her should not downplay the music on the album in ANYONE'S eyes. This time, it was 5 out of her 14 songs that made me cry. Mariah has grown through her career, and this marks another milestone. Her vocals are more amazing than before, and she has a sense of love, happiness, and strongness on this album. Buy this CD...you can thank yourself and me later :0)"
2,Where are we headed Mariah ?,"From the first track, ""Heartbreaker"", I already noticed that it was just a variation of Fantasy, even I could mix the two songs with not much of an effort. "" ""Can't Take That Away"" sounds like a new rendition of her now classic ""Hero"" from her Music Box album. The only song which caught my attention was her remake of ""Against All Odds"". I'd give my two stars for that song and Heartbreaker probably. She continues to collaborate with other hip hop artists like Usher,Snoop Doggy Dog, Missy Eliott and now 98 degrees. I'm also wondering why the Britney Spears image for this album. Why is she ruining her diva status by going teeny bop image,even to the point of looking bitchy, YUCK! I just wish that her next album would redeem her. GOOD LUCK!"
4,A 'Rainbow'of Styles and Feelings,"Mariah is good on this CD, but it's not her best. Too many rappers. ""Heartbreaker"" is a good song, but it gets annoying after a while. Its remix would be better if it didn't have Da Brat and Missy Elliot on it. ""Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)"" is better than Phil Collins's version (I've never seen the movie, so maybe it's better then). ""Crybaby"" is not her best, but the lyrics are SO CLEVER! ""Did I Do That"" is hilarious because it is directed at her ex, Tommy Mattola. The best song on the CD is ""Vulnerability"" interlude, and should be the world's shortest single. Bottom Line: Good for new stuff, far from her old self, except for ""Against All Odds""."
2,"Mediocre, at best!","With the impending release of Carey's next project, I decided to review my entire collection of her work. ""Rainbow,"" the album in question, is such an overtly bland recording that I can only hope that the future is brighter for the singer. How someone of the vocal prowess of Mariah Carey could have produced such a lifeless work is beyond me. Too many of the tunes here are rehashes of past successes, with the added ""bonus"" of guest artists, such as Dru Hill and ""Missy"" Elliott, to, perhaps, add some flava.Because Miss Carey has been rather prolific since her debut in 1991, she might need to take a longer hiatus between albums. The follow-up ""Glitter"", while much better than ""Rainbow"" still lacks the ""emotion"" the singer exhibited in her first three releases.It is hoped that the upcoming ""Charmbracelet"" will get the singer back on track as one of the premier singers of the day.I hope that there will be a ""pot of gold"" at the end of that ""rainbow"" for her millions of fans."
3,Under The Rainbow(Continued-Part 3),"Did I Do That: This is a good effort. Liked the lyrics(about Tommy or Derek?)And the song has anice melody. Good album track. Petals: I absolutely agree that this is the most exposed we've seen Mariah. Showing much more emotion and heartfelt lyrics than the other tracks. But then Mariah usually gives us one track per album where she exposes her heartbreak to us. We need more of these kind of lyrics Mariah. You got it in you!Somewhat dark, which I liked. Rainbow: Again, should have definitely been a song. and not a snippet! Thank God I Found You:The verse is brilliant! The chorus not as good but still a good song. Should be the next number one! Overall, an uneven album but it has a few gems."
4,4 stars for mariah,mariah carey is a wonderful artist with a beautiful voice.I give this album a 4 because it was very good.I think mariah could have been a little bit more mariah though. If you buy this album be ready for a not really mariah but a great album with alote of cool songs!
2,Not one of Mariah's best...,"I am a fan of Mariah Carey, and my favorite album has to be ""Vision of Love"" because her voice totally moved me. Ever since she's been just mediocre. The song ""Heartbreaker"" grew on me, but I love 98 Degrees, so I enjoy ""Thank God I Found You."" I don't recommend it to everyone, but if you like Mariah Carey a lot, I suggest you buy it. I won't even discuss the album cover, Mariah honey, what where you thinking!"
3,Mariah's a disappointment.,"I really wanted to like this cd, but I only enjoyed about 4 of the songs. There is too much production and riffing going on that you can't really enjoy it. I would much rather listen to the old school Mariah were she belted out cheesy ballads. I have to say that ""You Can't Take That Away From Me"" and ""Thank God I Found You"" are two of Mariah's best songs to date. Stick to the cheesy ballads we have all grown to love you for"
5,BEST EVER!,"To everyone who is hating on Mariah, half of you probably don't even own Rainbow, or are fans of some other diva. Anyone who has heard and followed Mariah's career would know that this album includes some of her most personal lyrics ever, and it displays a rainbow of guests and musical styles! The album is the bomb! From the very uplifting ""Can't Take That Away"" (which all you haters should listen to!) to the smooth ""Crybaby""... the songs are just completely amazing! Go Mariah! What a wonderful disc, certain to bring with it a pot of gold."
5,"AMAZING,BEAUTIFUL............","Mariah carey is an amazing singer and this cd really showed her wonderful talents.I recommend this cd to everyone.some of the songs made me emotional and i loved it so much. Mariah expresses herself through her music and thats whats so great about her music and talent.I am a big fan of M.C. and will always be a big fan.The song ""Cant take that away"" was very inspirational to me.This is a great cd so i recommend this cd to everyone."
3,"Okay, But Not Her Best","This CD was a disappointment to me because I am a huge fan of Mariah, and I have a lot of respect for her music. Whenever I'm listening to it, I only listen to about six songs on here. The best songs on here would probably have to be Heartbreaker, How Much, After Tonight, X-Girlfriend, Heartbreaker(Remix), and Did I Do That? So Mariah Carey fans, if you are looking for a really good album of hers, do not waste your money on this!"
3,It's OK,I didn;t really buy this CD it was a gift but I was in love with her 3rd and 4th albums (Daydream and Fantasy). But this one was kinda different sure I liked Heartbreaker but that was about all. She's going into the pop trend instead of doing her usual soft rock. Some people might love this album but let me warn you it is not the same this as her previous stuff. She has an amazing voice which is why I bought her CDs in the 1st place. Also is it just me or is she going more for sex apeal now? In the remix of Heartbreaker they had to edit the rap part. Happy listening!
5,Mariah's true emotions shine through,"This album is her best work to date. I was shocked when I read some of these online reviews and I just had to comment. For Mariah's entire career, I have loved all of her songs, but they were all very superficial and not really deep (with some exceptions). I think this album is the first collection of songs that are everything she intended them to be. Mariah finally has the freedom on this record to express her true self, not just a one-sided image, through her lyrics and music. I am Mariah's number one fan and I think this is her best work to date because, by listening to it, I feel more of an understanding of who Mariah Carey really is."
4,Only Four Stars Because It's Mariah...,"This is an okay album, with a couple of good tracks and mostly okay tracks. I happen to like her ballads more than her attempts at rap. Mariah, you're not Missy or Da Brat...don't try to sing like them. I don't like her new image, but this album has some good tracks ""Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now""(which is not nearly as good as the original, but still good), ""Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)"" and ""Thank God I've Found You."" I did not like ""Heartbreaker"" or the Remix. This is a good album if you like Mariah, but if you're a fan of her early '90's stuff, stay with ""Music Box"" and ""Daydream."""
3,Needs More Substance,"I love Mariah Carey's music! I own all of her CDs and was looking forward to this one. The singles, ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Thank God I Found You,"" were great. So I figured the album would be, too. However, I was wrong. Some songs like ""Bliss"" and ""How Much"" went on and on and seemed to have no point. The song ""Petals"" was far to involved in self-pity for me to like. The interludes were to long and sappy. However, the only thing saving this CD are acouple of the songs. Of course the singles save it as does the inspirational ""Can't take That Away."" But her remake of Phil Collins' ""Look At Me Now"" is so heartfelt and warming that I listened to it over and over. All in all I'd say this CD is average. Definetely not one of her best and it is obvious it was put together in only two months."
2,FAIR,"IT'S A PERSONAL RECORDING FOR MARIAH BUT IT SEEMS THAT SHE SORT OF RUSHED IT A BIT.NEEDS MORE CREATIVE THOUGHT.OVERALL,IT'S A FREEING PROJECT FOR MARIAH AND THAT'S ALL THAT TRULY MATTERS.IT'S FROM HER HEART!"
3,An honest- truthful review,"I like to consider myself a Mariah fan. I own all of her previous albums and listen to them regularly. Mariah Carey, Daydream, and Butterfly are three of my favorite CD's by her. Vision of Love, Dream lover, Fourth of July, and Underneath the Stars rank in the top of my favorites songs by her. I wish Mariah would use more of natural voice and less of her falcetto voice on Rainbow, because when she really does sing she sounds awesome. Two songs where Mariah is on vocally speaking are Can't take that away and Against all odds (this is a weak remake, but vocally it's done well.) I would of prefered more Mariah and less of everyone else. This album will do well initially but sales for Rainbow will decline, mark my words. Mariah seems to be a step late most tracks sound like copied version of other popular songs. If you're a diehard fan or love hearing great vocals I reccomend the album. If you're looking for quality music, look else where."
4,Truly a rainbow,"The album explains the cd to the fullest. There are so many different types of soongs on the cd. I think the best are; Heartbreaker with Jay-Z,X-Girlfriend with Usher f/2pac and Crybaby with Snopp DOgg. I think that most peoples favorite part of the cd is when Snoop Dogg comes on and raps like ive never heard anyone rap before, even him, in one big laid back breeze. Buy it only if you respect and love Mariah like me."
3,Not The Best,"In her new album there are some songs that are really good like ""Heartbreaker"" ""Ex-Girlfriend"" ""Thank god i found you"" ""can't take that away"" ""Against all odds"" This songs are just brilliant alll the other songs are not good as this songs This album is not like 1's who was just excellent I hope her next album will be better than that one"
3,Pretty good,"I was disapointed at the cover of the album and how Mariah Carey presents herself. But over all the album was good. I love the song Heartbreaker it mixes pop, rap, and R&B. I loved the song Thank god i found you. i was however disapointed in the amount that 98 degrees sang. but still a good song. And Mariah's Theme is an inspirational song that can keep many optimistic about themselves."
2,RainBLOWs,"I've listened and enjoyed Mariah since I was a Freshman in high school. I've loved everyone of her albums except this one... Trashy remixes, scratchy voice... this album does no justice to herself or to her fans. I took this cd back the same day I bought it. Though she did an okay remake of Phil Colins song, I thought the rest of the cd bombed! Mariah, if you read this... girl YOU CAN DO BETTER!"
4,colorful rainbow,"the cover art IS pretty trashy, but the music is good and she sounds like she's in better control of her voice than she's been recently (i.e.""i still believe""). best cuts..""can't take that away"", ""after tonight"", ""crybaby"", & ""did i do that""."
5,GREAT!,This album is clearly remarkable! It is great for any pop/r&b fan because it is a mix of both music.] It is definetly the best album of 1999 and probably 1998. Great Job Mariah!
5,GOOD BALADES,"I think that this album is great if you love soft songs. If you are looking a lot of song like heartbreak, this is not the album for you. But you must check uto Can't take that away"
5,"GREAT Ballads, GREAT Hip-Hop songs","I believe that Rainbow is Mariah's best work to date. The ballads are very inspiring and powerful which include Can't Take That Away, Petals, Thank God I Found You, Against All Odds, After Tonight, and Rainbow. I also believe that her voice is the best since the Daydream/Music Box era. The hip-hop influenced songs are very catchy and fun. Mariah did a fantastic job! This is a MUST HAVE for anyone!"
3,Not quite Carey,"Mariah Carey's latest, Rainbow is not quite up to par with her previous works. There are certainly some good tracks on this album (""Heartbreaker"", ""Thank God I Found You"", ""Can't Take That Away"") yet the bulk of it is high pitched screams without much music to accompany it. Not a must buy."
3,hmmm... ok...,"I just listened to this whole cd and the one song that struck me was the remake of Phil Collins' ""Against All Odds(Take a Look at me now)""... she sang it with such emotion! To be honest... i am SICK OF listening to ""Heartbreaker"" on the radio...it is ABOUT PLAYED OUT! The rest of the cd is something that is left to be desired."
2,I gave it 2 stars 'cause I bought the thing...,"but what a let down. Geez, Mariah. The girl has been through some stuff and yes, I used to be one of those hard-core Mariah fans too. You know, back when she was writing and singing from the heart. ""Vision of Love""? I cried. ""Make It Happen""? Cried. This album...was an upset. Or should I say, I cried. Even though if i could, I would Record some of my favorite stuff on a separate CD like,""Against All Odds, Thank God I found You, and Cant Take that away"" Most of the other stuff was whack."
2,Mariah Carey needs A Career Overhaul,"Truly, she has one of the best voices in music today but with this recent release into the ""R & B"" world where no one can pick a note and stay on it, she really falls flat. I must say that the first three albums from Mariah are really well done. Mariah Carey is starting to travel a path that Whitney Houston has travelled. Whitney has yet to really redeem herself from this R & B nightmare. Mariah is going to get herself caught with no career and no fans if she continues to venture this direction.She should use her instrument, not abuse it. Unfortunately, it seems as though she can't really tell the difference.If you are a fan of Mariah's, you may be interested in this album. I will forever remain true to the older Mariah that actually sang. This one will be appearing on auction very soon."
2,IT'S OK...,Mariah's old stuff rocked! This is just pathetic. I have to say I enjoyed against all odds but that was it. Butterfly was a really good cd that this one can't even compare to.
3,"COOL, COOL...","Hey...it's a little late to be getting this CD, isn't it? Well, I liked it, but I'm not really a fan of Mariah's albums, rather I enjoyed her hip hop cuts like ""Fantasy"" and ""Always Be My Baby (JD remix)"". This album is not as sappy as the older ones that EVERYONE loves, rather, it's more Pop/R&B than Adult/Contemporary. I love ""Petals"", produced by my favorite producers, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. She has a cool little vocal duet with Usher on ""How Much"" that borrows from 2Pac's ""Me and My Girlfriend"". I'm not sure if this album will be considered a classic like Music Box is, but I liked it because it doesn't seem to take itself as seriously as the older albums like Daydream and Butterfly. Well, cop this if you have money to burn, or if you like the ""new"" Mariah.P.S. I also felt ""Crybaby"" with Snoop, and the remix of ""Heartbreaker"" is probably the best track on the album...Good stuff."
3,"It is alright, but not great.","I just got Rainbow and I am a little dissapointed. It seems that this album is lacking some elements. I do not think that this album lives up to Butterfly, in my eyes, her best album yet. There are only a few highlights on this album, ""Did I Do That?"", ""Thank God I Found You"", and ""Against All Odds."" The rest of the album just seems weak, especially the stretch from track 3-6. I think this album lacks the really good songs from Butterfly like ""Breakdown"", ""Close My Eyes"", and ""The Beautiful Ones."" Don't get me wrong, this album is entertaining but not as good as its predecessors."
2,all craft and guile,"if it's true that the album is a result of the emotional roller coaster she has been on,i don't have any reason to doubt her - the ride seems to have taken a heavy toll on her voice.it took billie holiday nearly 20 years of drug and alcohol abuse (not to mention jail time) before she finally gave way in the end. mariah's only been a little over a decade in the business but her voice is already frayed around the edges."
4,Mariah Shows Her Talent Once Again,"With the long awaited album Rainbow, Mariah Carey once again shows off her vocal capabilities. With a decidedly more hip-hop sound, Mariah plunges into new levels of sound as she belts out amazing songs that move, inspire, and make us all just want to dance. As usual, there are ""radio songs"", songs that were designed to make hits, but unlike some of her earlier albums, Mariah tends to focus more on the music than the charts. She shows much more of herself, and gives the listener a real view into her current state of mind. This is one of her best albums to date, and I look forward to continued success in her career."
2,Should have been better after Butterfly,"I was really looking forward to this cd.I never really liked Mariah until Butterfly.That album was much more well balanced than this one is.It had great ballads such as Butterfly,My All,and Whenver You Call.It had even better R&B songs such as Honey, The Roof,Breakdown,Babydoll and The Beautiful Ones. On Rainbow the only songs I like are Heartbreaker(orginal version),Crybaby,Did I Do That?, Petals and Thank God I Found You. The rest of the 9 songs I have to skip through and believe me I have tried to like them.A big letdown!"
5,The album is like a story and its amazing!,"I have all her albums and this truly is her most personal. I know people see the cover and make judgements but she si by far more talented than all the big names like Celine, Whitney, Gloria, Madonna ect. her albums always have substance. For example the song Petals is amazing i hope she releases that to radio because thsi song makes you realize she is human and has family problems like everyone else its so deep. also Mariahs theme is very personal too and really touched me. and then you get a taste of her classic pop sound with Heartbreaker which I love and the song crybaby is awesome too. Honestly she si a true talent and in a league of her own just like this album, I also think there is an extremely intelligent woman behind the glamourous sexy look she portrays!"
5,Best CD of 1999!,"This CD is incredible! I really love this CD, and will recommend to all the people in the world!"
5,somewhere over tha RAINBOW,"u will find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, indeed this album is a pot of gold, HEARTBREAKER is already a piece of ingot, Can't Take That Away, is also one great song, After Tonight, Thank God I Found You, Bliss & Petals, great ballards. i really like the remake version of against all odds!"
4,Excellent cd with heartfelt lyrics,"I thought this cd was great! I wouldn't say it was her best, but I really felt like there was a story here coming from her heart. I like the hip-hop mixes and the ballads. My favorite is How Much and the Heartbreaker remix. Petals is also a great song that I can relate to. Mariah is an amazing and talented singer. I've been a fan of hers from the very beginning and I've watched her style change over the years. I think Mariah is an amazing women with a GREAT voice! I'm still and always will be a huge fan."
5,LADY NEWYORKER FLEX THE BOMB,"++++ON THE HEARTBREAKER SOUND, THE REMIX IS THE KICKER, USING THAT DOWN HOME MIX OF MISS AND THE SWEET FLAVOR OF DA BRAT AND TO BUST IT OPEN WITH THE JUCIES OF JAZ-Y. ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE BIG APPLE..I WILL KICK BACK WITH THE REST OF THE CD AND ENJOY THE FALVOR OF MARIAH.....KEEP KICKING IT GIRL................"
5,Wonderful,"The song ""Petals"" should definately be respected and viewed as one of Miss Carey's best-written."
2,Mariah is now so-so,"I loved Mariah back in the days of ""love Takes Time"",""I Don't Wanna Cry"" or ""Someday"". She has soul and rhythm. Her voice is great ans still is but i think her music has gone down a couple of notches. She doesn't quite possess the same sexiness as she used to. Now, it seems like she is just trying a little too hard. And her songs are not the great either anymore."
3,"Not as good as ""Butterfly""","It seems like Mariah is trying to repeat the r&b/hip-hop formula she used on ""Butterfly."" At times it works well, other times not-so-well. The album doesn't break new ground either. I love ""Heartbreaker"" but it sounds too much like ""Fantasy"" and ""Honey."" ""Can't Take That Away"" reminds me of ""Hero"" and ""Thank God I Found You"" is in the same vein arrangement-wise as ""One Sweet Day."" This doesn't make them bad songs, just not original. It's kind of sad to hear an artist remake herself! Her cover of ""Against All Odds"" is good. I thought that was the CD's standout track. The duets with Snoop and Usher are weak as is the track ""Ex-Girlfriend."" I couldn't listen to ""Petals,"" which sounds like ""Butterfly."" Program the CD in this order and you may enjoy it -- #14, #9, #2, #5, #3, #11, #1."
5,She's the best!,"Mariah has one of the best voices out there. This cd proves it! Go out and buy it you won't regret it! I epecially love ""Heartbreaker"", ""Can't take that away"", ""Against all odds"" and ""Thank God I found you"". Thanks Mariah and keep on singing forever!"
5,Mariah has found the end of the rainbow,"This album captivates the struggle of a artist who has fought so hard for her artistic creditabilty . Rainbow is like a story being told, with a happy ending. Mariah has never had an album that dips on different styles of music. From ""Heartbreaker"" to the heartfelt ""Petals"" each song tells a story and I think that if you listen carefully you will realize that there is a pot of gold at the end of each rainbow. I think in this album Mariah has proved to the world that she is able to stand on her own!"
2,Fair album,"I think Mariah should go back to her POP music, she just doesn't show off talent with R&B music. I am happy that she is returning to that high octave scream but the songs on ""rainbow"" just aren't that good. Maybe next album."
4,Loved it,"I pretty much enjoyed ""Rainbow,"" Mariah Carey's seventh studio album. The LP showed a slight departure from Mariah's previous style as an ""adult contemporary artist""; her songs are laced with R&B/pop-style influences and show more colloborations than Mariah typically did in her younger years. The album is more reminscient of ""Butterfly"" than her older albums like ""Music Box"" and ""Fantasy."" She loses her reliance on lovelorn ballads and her wide-range voice (except on Track 3, ""Bliss""), but the fresh addition of R&B/hip hop standbys like Missy Elliott and Da Brat caught my attention. Verdict: If you're a die-hard ""old Mariah"" fan, I wouldn't get it. If you're liking Mariah's new ""coming out,"" get it."
5,"Review for ""Rainbow"" by Mariah Carey","Mariah Carey definetely chose the right music genre. Her strong, powerful voice would never fit into the rock genre which has become so popular in today's culture. Mariah's hit R&B singles are so catchy that you'll never get tired of them. Every song on the album can keep you singing all day. Mariah's voice is so amazing that it makes you wonder how people like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson ever made it in the music business. ""Heartbreaker"" is by far the most captivating and alluring cut on this album, and the remix featuring Missy Elliot, DJ Clue, and Da Brat doesn't leave anyone disappointed. I have to admit that I'm usually not a fan of mixes unless they are reggaeton, but the remix of ""Heartbreaker"" is one of the best mixes I've ever heard. All the singles on this album are standouts. This is perhaps the best album in Mariah's career."

5,"A good system, but not touch free......","This system has been a blessing for me. I used to print CD's one at a time and it was a real pain. As my business grew I needed more power. I recieved this two days before my daughter was born and set it up to use while I was on PAternity duty. It setup easy and ran very low maintenance. I was running it on a computer that was doing nothing but that, and technically not up to the spec they recommend. Occassionally I have to reboot the machine, but that's the case with any windows machine. I think it approx. 18 months I have likely burned and printed about 6000 CD's. Business is growing again and I recently bought a high speed duplicator. That machine cost me $1100 and will do 11 CD's or 43 seconds for me so my bravo is just used for printing now.I strongly recommend this. It's not perfect, but nothing with moving parts that is used alot is going to be no maintenance forever. This machine has been a stud for me....."
4,"Works fine, if you know how to use it.","I have has two Bravo's, the original and the Bravo 2. Both have been rock solid execpt the burner in the original Bravo stopped working and had to replace it , but we must have burned thousands of DVD's with it so we got our money out of it. The Bravo 2 has been in use for a year now, well over 1,000 DVD'S burned, and no major problems. Don't care for the high ink cost but the product looks and works great. Using Powermac G4's and G5's. Mac software is great, stable and easy to use (of course, it's a Mac!)Hint:1. Let the machine run, don't open the cover and don't use the computer for anythine else while it working.2. Burn everything 4x or under (more reliable burns)"
2,Absolute garbage! Been using this product for 4+ years!,"First of all, this thing is great when it works. In theory, it's a robot, and should pick up the CDs, print, burn, drop the finalized CDs in the bin, and repeat the process.GOOD LUCK! The software is rarely ever updated, you can't enter CD text if you're running a mac, and it's definitely not something you can run without being in the room. It's very common for the unit to load multiple CDs into the printer, stop working with random error messages mid-batch, and for it to completely waste ink in the process (and ink's not cheap!)Find something else to spend $2000 on. It's a pile of horrendous garbage."
1,Don't buy this!,"This is without question the worst technology investment I've ever made. The software is poorly designed and features drop off. It freezes up regularly while you try to burn and print discs. I've spent more time babysitting this than it would have taken me to burn and print discs manually. Save your sanity -- keep burning manually or spend another $1,000 to get something that works."
4,Nice Leg Warmers,I looked around for quite a bit before buying these leg warmers. They were exactly what I was looking for. They are nice looking and keep my legs nice and warm. After a few washings they begin to loose their elasticity however they are still better than any others that I have owned.
2,very misleading,"the showing of the product and the fact that no choice of color is offered lead you to believe that you are getting 6 or 7 - however only one arrived and for the price one is not worth it, You need to explain its one and offer a choice of color so ppl know what they are ordering"
2,They are okay.,Not really what I thought they would look like or feel like. They are still pretty nice.
2,different than the picture,"These leg warmers weren't what I expected at all. They are described as dance leg warmers and my daughter wanted them for ballet. When I got them, the tag said boot leg warmers. They also looked completely different from the picture. I ordered light pink but what I received was a bright pink. I decided to keep them though just because I didn't want the hassle of sending them back."
1,Poor Customer Service,Merchandise ordered was never received and seller does not respond to my email inquiries. Very poor customer service.
3,will do,Bought these in a few colors.. they don't keep too warm but are stylish. They tipped and feel apart after two years as well are extremely stretched out... great for the price though
2,Could not really get into this book,I was unable to get involved in this story. I did not like the way it bounced around in time periods.
4,Robbie's first solo album is a nice surprise.,"Not bad at all. This is a complete departure from the work he's done with McCartney and The Pretenders. This McIntosh album draws heavily from blues, country and rock influences. Finally, we really get to see what this man can accomplish. I can now see where the country influence from some of McCartny's tracks from Off The Ground: The Complete Works comes from. Robbie's voice isn't as solid as one would hope, but the compositions are nice and the guitar is naturally excellent. Also, I love the cover!"
5,Emotional Bends - Robbie McIntosh,"I knew Robbie was a great guitarist playing licks with the likes of Sir Paul McCartney but he really shines playing his own stuff. The more I play this the more fantastic it sounds. (In fact I'm listening to it now!) The album is one of my very favorites. This is a keeper. Can't wait for his next offering, the day can't come fast enough. This guy is a true talent! Don't wait, buy this album. NOW!"
3,Not the greatest phone,"I have had this phone for about three years. Last year the caller id deteriorated and I cannot see who calls. The batteries are finally going on it but then again, I don't use this phone that much. Have to get new batteries now but very frustrated about the caller id not working."
2,Batteries Didn't Last,"I must say I am pretty disappointed with this phone. I have the version that supports two handsets, neither of which is an answering device. I found that the battery life, by the time I owned the phone 8-10 months had dwindled to less than 30 minutes per call. I also wasn't a fan of the very flat contour to the phone. On the positive side, the quality of call and speakerphone were outstanding."
4,Functional but homely,"This pair of cordless headsets has been working perfectly. I bought them because my 2.4 Ghz sets were getting interference from my wireless computer network.The only thing I'm not wild about is the physical design of the headsets. They look and feel rather ""clunky,"" and do not fit comfortably in my hand."
3,"OK, nothing special","I bought this phone in hopes that it would have less interference with my 2.4 wireless network for my computer; the phone works fine, no complaints, but there was no improvement on my network performance...if you are looking at changing phones from 2.4 to 5.8 to improve your wireless network performance, I would suggest investing in an improved wireless router etc. instead."
3,No Insight Involved: Dilbert,"The premise of this obvious marketing ploy is that you are supposed to get familiar with the characters from the popular comic-stip Dilbert. There are very few cartoons in it, truth to tell so you would be much better off buying a treasury. This is not to say that it isn't fun to read, but just not worth the money when you can buy twenty times that many cartoons for only about $10."
3,Useful yet pitiful,"This book shows us all sides of every character. Dilbert, Dogbert, Catbert, Ratbert, Phil, Alice, Wally, The Pointy-Haired Boss, and so on, including Dilbert's Mother. For most of the character's page, you only get three cartoons (some have more) and some strips are is small type. This book is useful in identifying characters, but pitiful in the selection and organization of the strips."
2,Buy a valve before you set out to install this!,I got this item today and is really upset with it. The T-valve Hyundai supplies along with this product is bad. It drips whatever you do. I read the review of another person here complaining of the same defect. So this may be a problem with their design. I too am planning to buy a T-valve from else where to check if that fixes the issue.***** update ****I bought a T-Valve and a sleeve from Lowes for around $8. That fixed the problem. So consider adding that to the listed product price.Also keep in mind that the cold water experience may not be very pleasant. At times water can get pretty cold and may make the endurance tough.
3,Only if you're a hard core fan.,"I own it, and I like it a lot. You might not. If you own like 5 albums already, or you need to finish your collection, go for it. If you decided you like them because your friend played it for you, and you want an album, don't. I would suggest you either get Remission, or Clense Fold & Manipulate. This album is a collection of their rare and very early recordings. Some of the quality really sucks, but you also get to hear the rudimentry beginnings of some great puppy tunes. A must have for the real fanatics."
5,thank god,"thank god they re released this album, it was a myth for years. I love it, it's noisy and abrupt, but it flows. if you love puppy, get it!BRAP ON"
4,Sound Music,"It's here that the influence of earlier industrial artists on Skinny Puppy becomes apparent. I'd venture to say that a majority of the work on this compilation resembles earlier Cabaret Voltaire (circaRed Mecca) on an aesthetic level. I get a lot of joy in how ""quaint"" these songs sound in comparison to their later, collage-oriented work. However, the real purchase incentive lies in the longer, more abstract compositions like Sore In A Masterpiece, Explode The PA, and Edge of Insanity. Yep, it's pretty good."
2,Good at first.......,"I bought this Tv my freshman year of college and it worked great, i never movied it from its spot where it was placed for 3 years, and if i took it home or moved, there was no damage done to it whatsoever. Then all of a sudden one day it kept shutting off out of nowhere. After turning it back on it would shut off immediately again. It would take a good slap to get it to stay on. That problem comes up like every 2 weeks or so now, and i seems like alot of people are having this problem. so DONT BUY IT"
1,piece of junk,"I have this item, it was less than seven months old. The power switch stopped working and Toshiba only stands behind this product for 90 days. They agreed to pay half on labor. I felt they should have taken care of the whole thing. I will never have another Toshiba brand anything."
2,Do not buy!,Power failed after 3 years of use..TV won't start up anymore...hopefully I can return it
1,The power failed after 18 months of use,"I had the same experience as one of the other reviewers. My TV/DVD combo worked very well for close to 18 months and then for no reason it refused to power up. We are still trying to determine what is wrong.I have owned Sanyo, Sharp, Panasonic and several other brands and have never had any problems. This product clearly has a defect.DO NOT BUY THIS TV/DVD Combo!!!"
2,Maaan... I hate to do this...,"Well, the TV worked fine until it stopped working. I noticed some problems with DVD playback, and tonight, the TV refused to stay on for more than 2-3 seconds. I checked to see if this was a common problem, and apparently, it IS, for many people. I give it more than one star because I did enjoy the TV while I could, but this problem that is apparently very frequent and common has never been addressed while this TV was still in production. Sad."
3,"Two Thirds of the Way Through, Unwatchable","Tedious and silly with problems that are no-problems. Scraping the bottom of the barrel, these characters seem to have nothing better to do than be-friend much younger neighbors or play pointless tricks on one another. I am just not getting this show."
3,Can't yet figure out this topsy world,"The vocabulary alone flummoxes me - these people are seriously weird with strange values and moral compasses. I am thinking this is the point of the show, maybe what is trying to make it funny, I am not sure. I keep watching, recognizing the sarcasm, but wondering why all of this goofiness precludes one authentic relationship between or among the cast. The great shields of gross humor are sort of the anti-relationship and, I am guessing, that is the point and what makes ""New Girl"" different from other television programs. I will continue to watch because I am curious and it makes me a bit uncomfortable. A good boundary stretcher."
5,Way cooler version of friends,"This show is modern yet absurd, as a comedy should be, reflecting a good combination of reality and the imagination we seek in television."
4,Love the Characters,"Season two is not quite AS wonderful as Season one, but still good so far! It's definitely still worth watching!"
5,Excellent Nick and Jess episode,"This was one of my favorite episodes centering on the Nick/Jess will they/won't they. It really helped build some tension between the two, and it was nice to see them admitting their mutual attraction. I always love when Nick shows his soft side because of her."
2,the degradation of a good thing,I used to really love the new girl- obsessively waiting for the next episode. But now I'm annoyed. Slowly and subtly they made this all about sex and loose conduct. It used to be 25% sex but practically the whole last season and now this one is based on Jess hooking up and Schmidt's....yeeeeaaaahhh. I regret buying most of last season's and this season's episodes. $2 per ep down the drain. Way to let a good show turn into another show I'll avoid.
4,Bullies at work,"I am a practicing attorney and handle human rights cases. I purchased this book to help me understand the subtle methods of sexual abuse in the workplace from the standpoint of women. I found the book to be instructional and of great assistance to help me to recognize such things as an ongoing ""grooming"" type of behavior by bosses who prey on subordinates for sexual favors; and the limited ability of women to even identify and deal with flattery and differentiate it from sexual advances.The book helps all who read it come to grips with what is called an hostile work environment.Robert A. ShainesAuthor of ""Command Influence"" a book soon to be published and dealing with another hostile environment in the military workplace"
5,Best loved children's book,"Miss Suzy was my all-time favourite children's story. My sister and I read it so many times we could recite almost the whole thing. I would love to be able to share this classic with my neices and hopefully with some daughters of my own. My Mom, Sister and I have been searching bookstores for years as our copy was damaged. It is truly a keepsake and worth passing on for generations to come"
5,Wonderful Childrens Book,"This book is my all time favorite children's book. I can remember my mother reading it over and over when I was little. The copy I have, has my name in it as well as both of my older sisters names. I was lucky enough to be Moms ""favorite"" so she gave the book to me. Just kidding :)The book is about a little gray squirrel named Miss Suzy. She lives in the top of an oak tree until some mean red squirrels chase her out. She does manage to find a new home inside an attic, but it just isn't the same as her home in the old tree. She comes across some toy soilders who she takes care of everyday. To show their thanks, the brave little soilders march off to win back Miss Suzy's old home.As a preschool teacher and mother I can tell you that this book is a real winner with the little ones. The story and the flow of the text engages both reader and listeners. It is sure to be a hit."
5,OMG!!!!This was one of my most favorite books growing up!!,"I can't believe I found this book.....the copy I had has been loved...ALOT.I'd like to get a new copy soon.I loved this story and my sister's favorite part was ""oh I love to cook,I love to bake,I guess I'll make an acorn cake""..it would make her laugh every time I read it(of course,I think it was more the funny voice I used than the little song).I hope Amazon will have this book when I come back to order a copy.This book was a very happy memory from my childhood."
5,A Sweetheart of a Book,"We found Miss Suzy at the local thrift store and fell in love with it on the first read.Miss Suzy is forced to leave her home in a tree by three rowdy, obnoxious squirrels. Lobel's drawings are classic in their depiction of these nasty characters. Miss Suzy eventually happens upon a dollhouse in the attic of an old house and settles there. The idea of a squirrel living in a dollhouse with these perfectly furnished rooms is one of those things that, as a young girl, would have fascinated me to no end. Even in middle age, I find the idea a happy one, so magical and dear.Upon discovering a box of tin soldiers, who have been longing to be released, Miss Suzy finds herself live-in companions, but is still sad over the loss of her sweet, simple home. The tin soldiers, in gratitude, defend her little home in the tree, scare away the evil squirrels, and honor Miss Suzy's kindness most admirably.I can't imagine a more lovely, enchanting story. It's just perfect."
5,childhood favorite,"My mom gave away our books when we were teens and I've been restoring the collection bit by bit as an adult. I found Miss Suzy a few years ago in an antique store and bought it, but now that it's back in print I'll be able to give it away to friends.My favorite part was the big spider Miss Suzy scares away and the soldiers helping her get her house back."
5,My granddaughter's and my favorite book!,"My granddaughter, Courtney and I have read this book so many times, we almost know it by heart. When she is here visiting, she always wants to read it. I am sure she will always have happy memories of the time we have spent with ""Miss Suzy""."
5,Wonderful book will bring back warm memories,"I believe that ""Miss Suzy"" arrived at our house via the Weekly Reader summer reading series. I was probably about 7 or 8, my sister is 3 years younger. We grew up in a household of readers and this book (and many others -""Old Black Witch"", ""The Cookie Tree"", ""David and the Phoenix"") are a warmly remembered part of our childhood. A great story for parents to read to K-2 and then for the slightly older to read to themselves."
5,Miss Suzy,"My mother had a copy of this book when my sisters and I were kids. We loved having her read this sweet story to us. We loved her little house! I recently found the copy and it was very worn, so I was pleased to see that I could order another copy to read to my baby girl, and extra copies for my sisters who also loved reading Miss Suzy."
5,It was my all-time favorite childhood book.,"As a child I read and re-read Miss Suzy over and over. Anytime I was feeling down or sick, it would always make me feel better. I could recite the words to it. I have no idea whatever happened to that book, I suspect my mother gave it away, but I have told the wonderful story to my daughter (who is 10) I would like to get a copy of it for her (and me) to read and enjoy."
5,We Must Get This Book Back In Print,"who do you get in touch with to get this lovely book published again for our children now? I used this book for 12 years as a preschool teacher and when I had open heart surgery this past spring, the book was misplaced in my library. It is a wonderful book that children remember through the year although it is read in the fall. Jump on the bandwagon, Miss Suzy needs to be in our children's world."
5,Second generation.,"Excellent, this book hasn't changed much since I read it to my child forty years ago."
5,One of our all time favorites,This was one of our favorite books to read to our children as they grew up. Last year we bought each of them a copy of the book and gave it to them for Christmas with an acorn shaped cookie cutter.
5,MISS SUZY .. WONDERFUL BOOK FOR KIDS,"MY SON WAS TWO YEARS OLD BACK IN 1973. I DON'T REMEMBER HOW I CAME ACROSS THE FIRST ""MISS SUZY"" BOOK I PURCHASED FOR HIM. I'VE ALWAYS LIKE TAKING HIM AND NOW MY GRANSON TO BOOKSTORES. MISS SUZY WAS HIS FAVORITE BOOK TO READ AT BEDTIME. NOAH,HIS SON, LOVES TO HAVE BOOK READ TO HIM. THROUGH THE YEARS I SOMEHOW MISPLACED HIS BOOK. NOAH IS NOW THREE AND I'VE RECENTLY SURFED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THE BOOK ON AMAZON. I GAVE NOAH THE BOOK AT CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR. AND HE LOVES IT. I READ IT TO HIM EVERYTIME HE'S AT OUR HOUSE AND CAN SPEND THE NIGHT. I RECOMMEND THE BOOK TO ALL CHILDREN OF ALL AGES. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A BLESSING IT WAS TO FIND THE BOOK AT AMAZON. I CERTAINLY WILL TREASURE IT, AS I KNOW NOAH WILL. THANKS AGAIN, IT WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK AND CAME BEFORE CHRISTMAS. YOURS TRULY MRS SUE OSTROM..."
5,One of the best children's books ever,"I was five years old when this book was originally published. My mother read it to me, and the memory is still vivid in my mind. This book is everything a child's book should be. The illustration is magnificent, and the combination of those images with the story of the gentle Miss Suzy creates a wonderfully warm, enchanting fantasy. Even though the plot includes conflict (the bullying red squirrels versus the good-guy toy soldiers), it is not violent, and it reinforces positive notions of wholesomeness, friendship, goodness and justice. I simply adored this book as a child, and I read the tattered old copy of it that I kept from my childhood to my own kids."
3,Too much Duncan McLean; too little Bob Wills.,"Duncan McLean can tell a good story, but mostly about himself. He's an interesting sort, but Bob Wills gave us an indigenous art form. If you want to learn more than the outlines of Bob's life and times, you'd best look elsewhere. Free Tip: If you do read the book, you'll get a lot more out of it by listening to a CD of Texas swing at the same time. In fact, if you have to choose between the book and the CD, opt for the CD."
4,music's loss (2),"When E T A Hoffmann redirected his output from music to literature the world gained a lot. Not only did his literature have great impact with other writers, but his stories became the source of much musical inspiration (Wagner, Offenbach, Tchiakovsky, Hindemith, Schumann, Busoni, Delibes .....). But listening to this CD made me realise the world lost a lot as well, because Hoffmann was a very talented composer. I had previously heard some of Hoffmann's chamber music and viewed them as pleasant but not memorable. The music on this CD has contributed to a changed view for me - this orchestral music is strong, vibrant, energetic and melodious.Other recommendations:Hoffmann's short stories, and his novel 'The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr'E.T.A. Hoffmann: Chamber Music, CPO CD (especially for the six duettini italiani)"
2,I Choked from the Necklace...,"I bought this book from skimming the back cover in a bargain bin. There was supposed to be a ""Chaos Machine,"" a ""Goblin master race"" and ""Age of enslavement""... I don't really recall reading of any of those things. Instead we get a very long and very boring tale about a guard and his romances. I wont give this book one star as I did not finish it. (A rare thing for me to do to be sure) so its possible there was some clever ending. More likely it was as poorly written as the rest of the book - or at least as dull as the first 400 pages. Give this one a pass; there was a reason it was in the bargain bin."
3,Romance or Fantasy,"I felt like this book couldn't decide if it was mainly a Romance novel or a Sci-fi/fantasy novel. The book's hero, Wilrowan, attempts to finally woo the woman he loves (Lili) -- 6 years after their forced marriage. I was really getting interested in this part of the story but felt that it was ultimately shortchanged when the sci-fi/fantasy part of the book took off. The author carefully adds more complexity to their relationship but then reconciles them too fast. I was looking for more of a payoff as the secrets that Wilrowan and Lili have kept from each other for 6 years start to come to light.In addition, the way that the author jumps from past to present is confusing. Especially since she uses a calendar that she invented for this world. So I didn't have a good feel for the linear sequence of events.Overall, I'd say that the first 50% of this book was very enjoyable, but then it started to lose focus."
1,not what i expected,"although the plastic looks sturdy, i did not expect the length of the bag. It was so long it almost reached the floor from the standard height of the closet bar. I should have measured it before I ordered. I would have returned if not for the hassle."
4,Good value,Good product for price...not the strongest storage bags I have ever purchased but reasonably well made and seem like they will hold up for some time with the limited used I give them (they store heavy curtains and drapes off season.)
5,Perfect for what I needed,I had many nice dresses that were all in the plastic bags given by the store that I bought them from. I bought this to consolidate and make more room in my closet. It is perfect for what I needed it for! Works for me!
5,Great item!,I was very pleased with the quality of this item. It serves its purpose with storing costumes. Plenty of room!
2,mediocre,This has alot of common knowledge information that you can find on the internet. The workouts are just a compilation of different weight workouts without saying which is better for boxing. The running advice is very good though
2,not so good !,I tried to use these instructions but they weren't as useful as I expected. This was my experience but it can be totally different with you ...
5,"If you're shopping, you MUST have this book.","The used aircraft guide is by far the most informative, best researched reference extant when it comes to buying a light aircraft. The authors not only have all their information straight, but write in a manner that makes your search fun, interesting, and most of all, informative. Learn little-known facts about the safety, reliability, and cost of ownership of over a hundred different models."
3,Don't use it in the daylight,"Unit seems to work fine, but don't try to use it in anything but a very cloudy day. You can NOT see the laser if it is halfway bright outside. I don't care if you wear the glasses, stand on your head, or use your imagination. You can't freakin' see it. If you shade the measuring stick with your hand just right, sometimes you can get a glimpse of the laser. I thought I just couldn't see it because I am color-challenged, so I had my kids and wife try to see it. They couldn't see it consistently at all.I almost sent it back, but I had had it for 3months before I used it, so i just kept it. I'll just become nocturnal when I am laying out a building or landscaping. I presume it would work indoors ok, though haven't tried it yet."
1,Not Impressed,I bought this item from Tool King about 4 months before I went to collect it from my mother in the U.S. Sad to say it was faulty and the batteries were leaking. Long story short I was not able to get a new one and had to get it repaired. I sent it clean and it was returned to me dirty. Where is good customer service? Never again!!!
3,Live in 1971,"This DVD is a Carpenters' live studio concert from London in 1971. Even though the audio/video quality of this disc isn't the greatest, it is still good to see and hear live performances by the Carpenters of some of these songs. A few songs sound synced to the original recordings, but most are live performances. The other reviewers are right about the quality of the disc, but don't let that stop you from purchasing it, if you are a Carpenters fan. Wish there were other concert DVDs of the Carpenters available."
3,Amateurish,"This is a great addition for a true Carpenters fan; however, it does not live up to hype. Quality is lacking."
1,Can't believe Amazon would selll bootleg!!!,"I was utterly disappointed in this product. This is nothing more than a bootleg. The songs aren't even in the correct order. The video jumps and changes color from time to time. This is a bootleg and a very bad one. Stay far from this. The only reason why I'm keeping it is because I love the Carpenters. I'll keep in until a real, high quality live in concert DVD is available....shameful..."
2,Steer Clear!,"The other reviewers said it all .... shaky video quality and annoying lyric sub-titles (which cannot be removed) trash what otherwise would have been a monumental release. Do not waste your money, perhaps they will someday release the 1974 Japan concert on DVD which would be fantastic."
2,Faulty pressings,"This dvd is likely to be pulled from the shelves soon as the BBC, which owns the right to this TV special, regular pulls clips off youtube. The master of this dvd copy comes from Japanese television, which explains why there are the Karaoke lyrics on the screen and Japanese subtitles.I bought a copy in Hong Kong and had to change it because the pressing is so poor and jumped all over the place. The second copy the shop has is the same as well which means I don't own a copy anymore, which is just as well. Maybe the Beeb will release it one day. What a shame they can't do a better job than the amateur graphics and sound mastering.All in all, very shoddy but a rare TV special which is more than good for that one song alone: WHEN HE SHINES."
1,Garbage,"Other reviewers here are 100-percent correct: This DVD is an amateurish ripoff at any price.It is under 40 minutes long, it has inept technical problems suggesting that it's a bootleg, it appears to have been taken from a VHS tape, and the entire video is plastered with watermarks, Japanese text, English text, and logos.I'm shocked that Richard Carpenter has not had this DVD removed from the market."
2,Ambivelent Book on Brujeria,"What I found disturbing about Ms. Devine's book is her claim of respect for the brujas she interiewed. I found that much of her commentary on the rituals were patronizing and often described them in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Not very respectful. She tries to claim neutrality in her introduction but her lampooning of rituals using expressions such as ""spooks"" in describing spirits says more about her than the brujas. If I were one of the brujas that she worked with to write this book, I'd be quite insulted to read the end result of what,I imagine, were sincere interactions on the part of the brujas to gain wider understanding of their tradition."
1,Wiccans doing it again eh?,"Nothing but wiccan fluff perpetrated by Llewyllyn to make cash. I rate this book the same as HooDoo mysteries by Malbrough who wrote an equally false book. If you are thinking of getting this one then think again, its not Brujeria, Voodoo, Santeria, or anything at all other than wicca using the name of Guadalupe as if she were just another architype of some wiccan goddess."
2,I don't Know anything about brujaria.,"I picked up the book knowin nothing about mexican religions. This Book read more like a teenage book of spells. (with explimation points and quotes like ""Need a boyfriend to propose? Call you Bruja Now!"") I'm half way through so far. I usually don't judge a book before i'm done but it's already too late for this one. I find myself Skimming more than reading. It talks more about loose Instructions for a spell. than has any real information or detail about what I thought I was buying. If u want instructions on how to do Tarots, then buy a book on tarots.. If you want to know more about Aztec/Guadalupe/ Or mexican folklore buy something else."
2,Not that great,"This book CAN be useful in the hands of someone who has studied both Paganism and Christianity. BUT, I personally would only use it as a refernce. This book was poorly done and I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. Don't waste your money."
4,Fine Source for Illustrations of Caterpillars,"Golden Guides are often described as books for children just discovering the natural world. While the series is eminently usable by young naturalists, Golden Guides are solid introductory field guides.The strong point of ""Butterflies and Moths"" is its extensive coverage of butterfly larvae and pupae. A common complaint about many if not all more advanced field guides for laypeople is that they fail to include illustrations for te identification of caterpillars. The Golden Guide remedies this shortcoming and includes solid coverage of moths as well, whose less-glamorous condition excludes them from other butterflies-only guides (the Peterson Guide is a notable exception). In terms of weaknesses, the illustrations of adult butterflies have, in my experience, not been detailed or accurate enough to positively identify some species."
4,Great info in a very small (and portable) package,"I bought this, along with several others, to supplement my daughter's science and language curricula. The best feature is the portability - it fits right into her coat or pant pocket!I've seen better guides, but they are much larger and cost up to 4x more. We're quite pleased and recommend the book to others."
4,A Jump to the Past,"Oaken Rings is a very well done book. While reading, I couldn't help but compare it to Timeline by Michael Crichton. Fox, however, is very detailed in the main character's experiences as he is displaced in the medieval time period, while I feel that Crichton is less detailed in the time period itself but more detailed in the technology that it takes to make a trip through time like that. Fox did his research. From the language of the time, to customs, geography, technology, warfare, politics, to what they ate and drank. He took you to the time period as if he'd been there himself."
1,Battery Tecnology-BTI will not warranty their product.,I purchase this item and three months later stopped working. Called BTI and they say they don't sell on Amazon when they do. Would not warranty product. Told me tough. Do not buy from Battery Technology or you will be out of luck.
1,If she only sounded as good as she looks...,"If she could only sing as good as she looks... When I saw the video for the title track Cornfed I thought she could be the next big thing. Now that I've LISTENED to her I can see why her singing career never really took off. Some of the songs start out with potential (at best) but don't take long to go south once she starts singing, especially when she attempts to really belt it out. Thankfully I was able to get this from a fine Amazon partnered retailer at a greatly reduced price. I'd be really upset had I paid full price for this."
5,big star in making,I didn'tknow too much about Shannon until I saw a copy of her cd in the Country Music Hall of Fame gift shop.I made a note to check out her webpage when I got home.I was intrigued & ordered her cd.She has a great voice.I'd call it Gretchen Wilson-like but a little sassier & sexier.She writes a lot of her own songs & shows a great sense of humour & fun.Check out Big Man & Can I Get An Amen.If you like true country sounds this might be the one for you.
2,Nothing new here....,"Don't waste your time and money on this one. If you've read any of the Fools' other excellent investing books, this one will do nothing to enhance your knowledge of Dow Dividend investing. I agree completely with the review below....this should have been a pamphlet. This book gets two stars only by virtue of the fact that there are some readers out there who may have never heard of the Dow Dividend approach. If you are one of those, the Approach is thoroughly explained, but is sandwiched in between 150 pages of filler."
3,Good...but visit web page and save the paper,"I love the Foolish line of books. This one was perfect to give to my mom. She's not likely to visit the web to read the same information. If you have been to the web page and read the portfolio on the Foolish Four, then you don't need this book. It's good material but very redundant."
2,They've abandoned this style they advocated,"A word to any further readers who come along this. The Fools have now abandoned this investment approach, which they so cockily and vociferously expounded for many years. Although the strategy still has its uses, and they are to be commended for their honesty in abandoning it, they no longer advocate it. Like so many reviewers have wrote in criticism of other Fool books, the Gardners tend to be overcome by hyperbole in their writing, and it seems they did not do enough statistical research to warrant the claims they've been making all along with regards to Foolish Four investing.The Fools are overall really good, and have some great ideas, but this book is now outdated. Take what they say with a grain of salt, adapt it to your own thoughts (and to their credit, this is what they advocate, although it IS easy to overlook this in their soaring prose, laden with outlandish statements), and the Fools definitely serve a purpose."
2,Not terrible but a bit foolish and silly,"I am familiar with the academic world through my family. This is not a glimpse into that world. This is a caricature of the academic life. Maybe in Europe or in literary circles, they race to every conference out there for a chance to visit more interesting locales or vacation. From my experience going to conferences, this is a simplistic view. It is great that it makes fun of people who sometimes take themselves too seriously though and some of the humor is funny. It gets old though, in my opinion and really does not get more interesting or enlightening as it goes along. This is the first time that I got within 30 pages of the end of the book and just couldn't read it any further. I hope it is the last time too."
3,for this movie...no!,"THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TAKING A STAND. SO WHY IS IT THAT MOST OF THE TRACKS ON THIS SOUNDTRACK HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE THEME OF THE MOVIE. THE SONGS, EVEN THOUGH ARE GOOD ARE VERY MUCH OUT OF PLACE. EVEN SO, MY FAVORITES ARE JA RULES, MASTER P'S, EVEN THOUGH I THINK HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TALENT. 112 SONG IS NICE, EVEN THOUGH SLIMS VOICE IS ANNOYING. THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS THAT I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER THE TITLES TO BUT ONE SONG THAT STICKS OUT THE MOST AND IS VERY PLEASANT TO LISTEN TO IS NSYNC THROUGH HEAVENS EYES. THOSE BOYS ARE A BIT OUT OF PLACE BUT THEY HAVE THE BEST SONG ON THE SOUNDTRACK. THEIR HARMONIES WERE OFF THE HOOK, NOT SURPRISINGLY. THOSE GUYS HAVE SOME SERIOUS TALENT ON THERE HANDS. BABY-FACE WROTE THE SONG TOO, SO YOU KNOW IT HAS SOME SERIOUS HEART TO IT."
3,JA RULE to the rescue!,"Half of this album is the bomb, the other half needs to be hit WITH a bomb. I'll tell you what songs are good: ""JA RULE"" that song is SO good, that it's worth buying the album just for that song! ""DMX"" blazin hot! ""MASTER P"" very good, super dope beat! ""AMIL & SOLE"" hella hella tight females! ""112"" decent. ""AZ & BEANIE SIGEL"" decent. ""OUTKAST"" very very strange, but decent. now all the songs i did not mention, they are all horrible! so if you are a huge fan of any of the ones i said were good, you probably need to get this album."
2,Bad Choice Of Song's For This Movie,"I've seen the movie for this CD and I must say the first half of this CD does not describe or feel with the movie. The movie is about some kids who want to have a voice people will listen too, the first half of this CD are rap songs that are there just to atrack attaintion to teens. What has happened to songs about what the movie teaches us? The N'SYNC song was probibly the only song that did this movie justace. Now I do buy CD's that although most of the songs aren't in the movie the theme of the movie is engraved on the CD (A good example is ""Pokemon The Movie: 2000""), but I think this wasn't needed. Please don't buy this CD if you liked the movie. It will surely disapointe you."
1,Just a Compilation/Spoiler Movie,"My title says it all. If you haven't seen the other movies in the series (especially 3!!!) then please OH PLEASE!!! for your sake don't watch this. Its just a compilation of the greatest kills and moments that will spoil the other movies somewhat IF you watch this first. ALL THIS MOVIE IS, IS A GIANT SPOILER...........its a shame full moon felt like cashing in on their devoted fans one more time before calling the puppet master series quits.... considering by the end credits, they thought this movie would be the last in the series.Excuse My Poor GrammerRobert Keith"
2,Puppet Master: The Legacy,"It's Ok, If you don't mind warbly filming and edditing of past films of the series to make a movie."
2,Only For Completists,"This film is a stock footage feeding frenzy and brings absolutely nothing new to the table. Ostensibly a look back at all the Puppet Master films that preceded it, The Legacy involves an adult Peter Hertz being interrogated at gun point by an attractive female assassin (Maclain) looking for revenge against the Puppet Master and his deadly creations. During the interrogation the tale of Andre Toulan unfolds from his humble beginnings as a young Puppeteer at the Theatre Magic in Paris through his epic battles against Nazis in World War 2 Europe and up to his Puppet's continuing reign of terror in America. For fans familiar with the film franchise, there's nothing new to see here. And you won't miss a thing if you ignore it completely. However, for the completists out there, you'll want to pick up a copy of The Legacy to fit that spot on your shelf in between Retro Puppet Master and Puppet Master: Axis of Evil."
1,THE LEGACY HAS BEEN TOLD...AND TOLD... AND....,"The fact that this movie has the tagline ""THE LEGACY HAS BEEN TOLD"" is hilarious to me only because anyone who has seen the previous movies, in particular ""Puppetmaster 3"", has already seen this movie. If you buy this DVD, you are wasting your money.1. The movie only runs 1 hour and 11 mintues2. Out of that 1 hour and 11 mintues, there's about 7 minutes of new material that wraps around the scenes of the previous movies.3. Why would anyone who loves the Puppetmaster series appreciate ""The Legacy"" at all? Even for completists like me, this is a very hard sell.I would like to think this is not this series' swan song. If it is, it went out on a whimper. Tom C."
1,OH MY GOD!!!!!,okey first lets talk about what the hell happened to the outstanding production of the movie!!!!it contained a lot of old clips and nothing new!!!the dvd case said that it includes over 2 hours rare behind the scenes of the puppetmaster series but that is a lie!!!!!well i am a big fan of these series so i expect a graet cinema movie soon!!!!!
5,KATE ORSINI IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Kate Orsini is great in the movie Gargoyles as well. What a great actress for horror movies! Go Kate!
2,Where is the score?,"Revell's lone selection on the ""Three to Tango"" disc - stuck behind thirteen hip tracks (some of which are rather fun!) - is of a style many refer to as 'sweeping.' It is melodious, and well textured, but utterly predictable. A snippet of dialogue breaks the three-minute sliver of underscore troublesomely, regardless of its appropriateness. Sufficient, but not memorable."
5,A True Standard For The Avid Knitter,"My orginal goal for this purchase was to get some basic stitches that I could use to start designing my own fabrics. Little did I realize how comprehensive this dictionary is - how much more could be contained in the other 4 volumes? Whatever stage a knitter you are, this first volume gives you more than enough information to get started, practice new skills, or move on to your own designs."
2,"Some good, but you need to know first","The patterns and instructions that are in here are helpful, however, pictures used to show what a given stitch will look like are much less helpful when they are black and white only. There is no reason, with today's technology, to not provide color pictures. Far more helpful areThe Harmony Guides: Knit & Purl: 250 Stitches to Knitedited by Erika Knight (and the other books in that series), and365 Knitting Stitches a Year Perpetual Calendar. The pictures in this ""treasury"" are so poor that I would consider it to be equivalent to getting written instructions without pictures at all."
5,"If I could only keep 20 books, this would be one of them","For any knitter who wants to explore using her own choice of stitches, this book is an absolute must. I've used my copy so much that the spine broke. Ended up getting it spiral bound at the copy shop which has worked great.Bottom line -- thank the knitting goddess that this is back in print and get a copy if you don't have one!"
4,in print for 40 years...,This volume (#1 in a series of 4) was originally printed in 1968. Need I say more? The ONLY reason this did not receive five stars is that the photos appear to also be from 1968 and at times are difficult to see clearly.
5,Does it get any better?,"I like Natalie Merchant. Her songs seem to have some thought and content. Her voice is amazing. I saw this CD and immediately fell in love with it. I have it on my iPod. The sound is great. If you are a Merchant fan, buy this DVD."
5,natalie is the best!,"natalie merchant is the best singer in the world! if you love her work or her work with 10, 000 maniacs, get this cd!"
5,didn't leave home without it...,"I have the video of this concert and played it all of the time at home, so when it came time to deploy to Saudi Arabia, I had to buy the cd. It has become a favorite in the dorm and at work, even with the guys. I even got an inquiry from the locals, who borrowed the disk. This is definitely an album of some of my favorites from Merchant."
4,The Bombay,"Sista got pipes, yo. I was presently surprised by this piece. My baby's mother had me listen and I was hooked despite myself. The whole album is tight because of the backing band. They lay down beats as dirty as your grandpa's sweatsuit. The bass lines is thick and just wrap around Natalie's melodies. ""Space Oddity"" is an oddity indeed, but it delivas the flava. If ya don't got it, go pick it up."
2,"Dull, drab, and barely worth listening to","Barely, I say, because three songs DO stand out as fine performances: her rendition of the 10,000 Maniacs song ""Gun Shy,"" a nice performance of ""Seven Years,"" and a fantastic cover of ""Gulf of Araby.""Unfortunately, between the three mentioned tracks is listless filler, songs that were slowed down from their orignal album-slowness.This isn't the Natalie Merchant of the 80s or early 90s. Seems she's aged twenty-five years since then, as the performance aspect of her show is gone, and replaced by sleep-inducing nothingness."
4,NATALIE MERCHANT GENERALLY IS A STRONG FEMALE SINGER. KOOL!,"I KNOW AND CAN SEE THAT SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE IS DOING AND KNOWS WHERE TO GO AND HOW TO GET THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE HAS SLOWED DOWN RECENTLY BUT SHE IS DEFINTELY A POSITIVE ROLE MODEL.! I'M 29 YEARS OLD AND LIKE ALTERNATIVE MUSIC I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND DON'T HAVE TO REVIEW HER MUSIC, BECAUSE IT'S ALL POSITIVE, NO BAD LANGUAGE. NATALIE MERCHANT IS GREAT ALL AROUND."
1,An oddity all right!,"I loved 10,000 Maniacs, and I've enjoyed much of Ms. Merchant's solo stuff. I started out liking this CD, but when I heard Space Oddity, I had to turn it off. YUCK! WHAT could have possessed her to cover that song? Am I the only one that found it disturbing and totally out of character? Give me a break! I will burn a copy of this CD without that track, and then destroy the original!!"
3,"Good, but Could Have Been So Much More...","While Natalie Merchant is one of the great female performers of the 90's, this live compilation doesn't do her real justice. ""Wonder"" and ""Beloved Wife"" are fantastic, but everything else seems a bit dull. You'll either love or hate her cover of ""Space Oddity"", and you'll rather here more tunes from ""Ophelia"" than listen to her Maniac songs ""Dust Bowl"" and ""Gun Shy"", which are still good, but are such old news."
3,something's missing...,"I've seen Natalie in concert 3 times (once with Lilith fair, and twice solo) and this album doesn't capture what I saw at her concerts. Since this is a Natalie Merhcant album, she should have performed more of her solo stuff. The vocals are beautiful and the album is pretty, but it's so downbeat. It doesn't capture the amazing and fun performer that Merchant is."
2,We need a live release from the Jennifer Turner era!,"For those of us who got introduced to Natalie thru Tigerlily, this live album comes up, regrettably, way short. The guitar playing is just weak. We need a live release from the Jennifer Turner era (who played on Tigerlily). She's one of the greatest guitarists of the nineties!"
5,Some of her best work yet...,"Having been introduced to Natalie's signature voice through the groundbreaking ""Mermaid Avenue"" albums, I purchased Ophelia and this album, which has made me a believer.Ms. Merchant's seductive voice and subtle tones make the songs picked for this disc, taken from a live performance in 1999, almost dreamlike in their enchantment and hypnotic affects.Her rendering of ""Gulf of Araby,"" with it's haunting lyrics and swooping guitar rhythms, shows the skill not only of Ms. Merchant, but of her band as well, which shines through admirably, while mixing with Natalie's vocals like a smooth drink with friends."
3,Natalie Live Could Have Been More......,"First off, this Live album should have been a collection of songs from her recent tour instead of NY only. Secondly, it should have included a few more Ophelia songs (and/or been a 2-Disc set). Don't get me wrong, I like this disc a lot (for what it is) but believe it could have been more. This album did not show the interaction/liveliness that a Live album should (ie MTV 10,000 Maniacs Unplugged or other group's live albums). I think a mixture of concert selections would have improved this factor. Her recent concert in my area was quite lively and reflected Natalie's true spirit and uniqueness. I love the album nonetheless and wish I could have given it 4 stars. I truly give it 3.75 stars..."
3,I was a skeptic...I still am...but i don't feel cheated.,"After several opinionless years, I've finally decided that I like Natalie Merchant, but not whole-heartedly. I like Merchant, and her new Live disc, in a ""fast-forward a track here and there"" kind of way. She has a beautiful voice and she sounds great on this recording, but for me that's not enough. I like SOME of Merchant's songs (esp. San Andreas Fault), but many of her lyrics seem too double-dipped in ego for me to take them seriously. One of the best things this disc has going for it is the cover-tracks (Space Oddity, After the Gold Rush, Gulf of Araby). This is one of those discs that I'm not unhappy I bought, but if it broke, I probably wouldn't replace it."
4,A Carnival of Wonder,"Natalie Merchant's live versions of her own songs, mostly off ""Tigerlilly,"" are pretty good but perhaps too faithful to the studio versions to be memorably distinct. What makes this live album strong are her covers of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" and Neil Young's ""After the Gold Rush."" Both are great, well-known songs by two of my favorite artists. Merchants' renditions do the songs justice. She makes them sound like her own without departing too much from the intent of the originals. On the whole, I think this album is best for either serious Natalie fans or very casual fans interested in a sampling of her post-10,000 Maniacs songbook. But if you're somewhere in the middle, get ""Tigerlilly"" first, which as a pure Natalie album, is better."
4,A great performance.,"Natalie Merchant is wonderful live, and her live recordings, both with the 10,000 Maniacs and by herself are well worth the purchase. This is another great CD; however it is a bit on the short side."
2,Disappointing throughout.,"This novel contains unlikely characters, weak dialog, and unexplained plot twists. Illogical events occur throughout which are never explained. This was a frustrating read in that I hoped it would get better while I continued to read. It didn't. My advice is ""Don't bother."""
4,page turner,"A good writer. A good series. The story is a little dated but delivers on its promise. Deal tries to save the First Lady, fighting bad guys and a hurricane. He has a lot of help from friends, who seem to make connections awfully easily. But you want a beach read, this is it. Just watch the waves."
3,"Fast-paced, fun, fanciful","This book was a good time! The premise is outrageous enough to put you at ease about its ever coming true, but exciting enough to make you read faster and faster. It's a little like watching a James Bond movie: you don't have to worry that the hero might get killed, because there are other ""John Deal"" books, and probably more in the works. I haven't read any other ""Deal"" novels, and probably won't. John Deal is pretty ordinary -- but has some extraordinary luck. As I said, it was fun and I recommend it."
1,Rough is right,"The only thing rough about this book is that it was allowed to pass a copy editor and onto printing while in rough draft form. This is by far one of the worst travel guides I have ever purchased...way out of date, biased, bigoted. If one ever intended to see the out of the way sights by using this book you may just as well forget it. The maps are unusable, there are no helpful tourists tips ie where to catch a tourist bureau, a restroom, etc. It makes you not want to visit Poland at all. What a shame since getting off into the country side areas, even cities of 10-25,00 people there is no info. Save your money and buy a national geographic subscription. ken gorski, el paso, texas August 16, 2003"
2,"Poland, The Rough Guide","This book is very negative in presenting Poland and its culture. Every time the author mentions something worth visiting, it is with reservations and he makes sure to diminish it in some way by subtly bringing negative aspects or comparisons (or questioning Polish origins of it.) Makes you wonder what were the reasons for writing this book. Many names are misspelled and prices not very accurate, especially for higher priced hotels and restaurants. Lonely Planet's Poland is much more enjoyable and accurate."
5,Ripe for rediscovery,"It is excellent news that this novel (of 1893/4) has been reprinted, since it is perhaps the most delightful work of a major novelist still hugely neglected. The style is admittedly an acquired taste: though admirably vigorous and distinctive, it makes us always conscious that we are seeing the story through the author's eyes rather than 'objectively'; but Meredith insisted that the objective viewpoint adopted by most novelists is a delusion and a snare. The story itself expresses some of his most strongly held convictions (on marriage, class, and education) in terms of a moving story, with many memorable episodes. Best of all is the reunion of the two lovers, swimming together in the sea. This is a sexual metaphor, richly expressive, and arguably preferable to both the prudery of most of the classics of English fiction and the crude explicitness of so many modern novels."
4,Works great!,We use this projector for our church and the remote finally wore out. Ordered this replacement. Works great. Glad I was able to find one.
1,Unredeemable,"I like orchestral synthesizer music. I like Vangelis, Jarre, Tangerine Dream, and Yanni. Some of their stuff from the 70's now sounds horribly dated, but it all sounds much better than this anemic production of Star Wars music released in 1999 and containing arrangements of what was then the ""new"" Star Wars film, The Phantom Menace.This recording comes to us from programmer and arranger Gordon R Wallin, a UK musician associated with the Chicago Musical Revue, a group producing synthesizer versions of stage musicals, including Cats, Phantom, Les Miserables, and Sunset Boulevard. The Star Wars release is so far the only title under the Chicago Electronic Revue.Which is just as well. The arrangements are by-the-book and the sound is shallow and thin, like computer game music from the 1980's.This is a truly atrocious project with nothing to recommend it.#"
3,don't say you love me.,"wilson phillips meets dance-diva-turned-folk/rock-ingenue meja in the pint-sized diva duo known as M2M. hailing from norway, M2M is poised to capitalize upon the current ressurgence of teen-pop music. their debut american release--the girls have already recorded and released a collection of children's song in their native oslo--""don't say you love me"", is catchy as hell and features lyrics that neither pander to their underage target audience nor insult the intelligence of more mature listeners. more importantly, M2M avoid the danger of getting lost within the spears/aguilera crowd by focusing on a more folk/rock-infused pop, rather than attempting to cop r&b or hip-hop styles."
1,YAWN SNORE ITS BORING,I think watching paint drip would be more intresting than this cd any day!!!!!!! I'd give it a 0
5,WOW!,"I got this CD in the mail.My friends said it was junk,but I tried it anyway.It had M2M on it,and I thought,""Amazing."" I am now a #1 fan!"
3,Boring,"I had really high expactations to this song, after reading you guys' reviews and reading about them in newspapers. The son got released in Norway last week, and I've heard quite a few times. What can I say? boring. It's not a bad song, they eaven wrote it themselves and they are 15 and 16, but the song is just plain boring! It's got an okay message I guess, but it's still not any original, just boring. Sorry."
2,Not what it purports to be,"Despite what the description says, this is NOT a compilation of thirteen 12""/full length versions. There is nothing here that hasn't been released somewhere else before. Yello 'I Love You' is still NOT the 12"" extended version (duration 4'06""). The mixes are good, but the compilation in itself is uninspired, among hundreds of other 80's compilations.For the uninitiated only."
4,Great for little hands,Bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas because his big brother was getting a Nintendo DS and I knew he would want one also. The DS is definalty for older kids because of the small buttons and delicate lid. This is perfect for little hands with bigger buttons and no moving parts to break off. The games are a little hard for him to take in and out but we can help him with that. Very durable as it has already been dropped and is still working!
5,Satisfied with product,Product arrived late but completely functional and with no cosmetic damage. Sold at a very good price. Would purchase again.
3,cheap lifesaver for trip,this and couple new games kept the kids entertained for hours on our trip to yellowstone!
2,Got what I wanted,It was in great condition and I got it very quickly. I got exactly what I ordered.
1,Hoodwinked!!!!,"I was very upset when I recieved this item. I was looking forward to open it up and be pleased. Amazon has never let me down until now. I bought a Gameboy Advance expecting it to be in new condition. What i got was a stained piece of junk. The buttons are sticky, there is red stains all over. It looks like it was dunked in chilli. Buyers beware."
5,Sexy Shoes,"This shoes is HOTT online but it's even better in person. They are amazingly comfortable and I'm so glad that I purchased 3 pairs of them. Plus, you can't beat the price."
3,Good but kinda of mediorche,"It is good that you have these mini's but I suggest that you stick to the plastic variety. For the following reasons:-The Drow Wizard's back banner doesn't fit and had to glued-on sideways-The Drow Ranger's hand snapped off and had to be glued-on. The other scimitar snapped off-Irae T'Sarran is missing a foot on my set-The Drow Soldier, Archer, & Warrior weren't the problem ones-The Drow Wizard, Ranger, & Irae T'Sarran were problem ones-The bases had to permantlty glued on because without the glue the minis would have fallen out of the base-The price for this set is unreasonable-The pewter minis require assembly and paint-The newer, more plastic minis aren't too expensive and are ready for use."
3,What you're paying for,"I'm really glad I bought this camera!~ It's really handy that it's so small! However, My hand has a tendency to shake when holding it so sometimes the pictures blur. Also, you can't really see what you're taking a picture of when it's dark out. And everytime i use the flash I get red eye.But overral I'm happy with my purchase. Red eye is something that is easily editted out and although the blur prevents ""perfect"" spontaneous pictures it makes them a whole lot more amusing...^_^If you're really picky just spend the extra money to get a nicer one.."
5,Great for 3/4 -10 NC Taps,I ordered the drill to drill for a 3/4-10 NC Tap. The drill cuts very good. I thought about buying another pne to have on hand when the need comes round again or if i damage the one I already own.
4,50 Years Not Too Late For a Sequel,"I found this book by accident in a [local store]and immediately snatched it up...I usually would wait and order from Amazon, but seeing the book I really wanted to read it now.I read ""Mrs. Mike"" a very long time ago (I was eight). I read it as a great adventure...my sister read it as a romance. I could never understand that aspect until I read the book again in my twenties. The wonderful thing about this (The Search for Joyful) book is that, yes, there are the elements of romance but again the heroine goes on an adventure that imparts information about history from an unique perspective. Anytime a book can teach, entertain and be subtle about it is a plus.I enjoyed the book almost as much as I had ""Mrs. Mike"" years ago. It was a pleasant read, made me laugh, made me cry in places and made me hope there wasn't going to be another 50-year wait for more stories about Mrs. Mike and her family."
2,I agree with much of what other readers have already said.,"Mrs. Mike was one of my favorite books when I was young. WhenI ran across this sequal I was hoping for something at leasthalf as good as the original. I'm afraid that I was disappointed.There are sections in the book that were somewhat interesting,but that interest didn't keep going. Too many characters did notgrow and change. Some were just plain self-centered, and neverseemed able to get past that - even given the supposed lifealtering war that they lived through. Some things moved tooslowly. Some things moved too fast. The pacing just didn't seemright to me in places. And yet I still managed to find just atouch of something in the story that made me want to finish itand see how things would turn out. I just wish that the storyall fit together better, and that it moved more smoothly."
2,"""Few sequels measure up to the original""","I first read Mrs. Mike almost forty years ago and enjoyed it very much. I reread it several times and I'm sure the story of Katherine Mary Flannigan influenced me to pursue a Ph.D. in history with an emphasis on women in the West. I was delighted to see this sequel appear, but Mrs. Mike barely shows up in the new work. The rich descriptions aren't there either, and the overuse of dialog to carry the story was annoying to me. Also this work is burdened with presentism, applying language and values of today rather than those in place fifty years ago. Oh Be Joyful's Daughter's story is a fascinating one on its own, and her struggle against racism is important to remember. But I wanted more of the charm of the original, and more about Mrs. Mike."
2,Disappointing sequal to a much-loved book,"""Mrs. Mike"" is one of my favorite childhood books, so I was excited to find a brand-new sequel on the new fiction shelf at the library. Well, I just finished it, and I'm sad to say it was a pretty big disappointment. It's not really a sequel to ""Mrs. Mike"" since she barely makes an appearance. The heroine, Mrs. Mike's adopted Cree daughter, never really surfaces as a realistic character. The dialogue is often stilted and the situations unbelievable. Was this REALLY written by the Freedmans? Hard to believe. Evidently other sequels are planned...hope they are an improvement."
2,Two big disapointments,I was interested to see how the two sequals of the Mrs. Mike story would turn out. I was so disapointed. Both stories are disjointed and have no flow of continuity from on to the other.The Search for Joyful could have been done indepth with the characters presented but stops short of real exploration. Also it had some things in it that prevented me from giving it to my early teen daughters to read as I did Mrs. Mike. They loved that story as did I at their age and such good examples of what real love can be and do. Katy Little Bird is even worse becaouse it is longer What happend to Crazy Dancer? Does he morph into Jellett? Save your money folks untill I get the time to do the rewrite for the authors. I know I can do better with the story line.
1,"Not worthy of the title ""sequel for Mrs. Mike.""","This book was terrible compared to Mrs. Mike. The characters are 2-dimensional, you lack any emotion for them, nor do you even care what happens to them. You could take this story, stick in a soap opera and not know the difference, as that is what this story basically is, a soap opera. Not at all worthy of being ""the long-awaited sequel to Mrs. Mike."" This book, was simply terrible, as a sequal and as a book in general. The plot is way too divided, you do not care what happens to these people at all, and the ending is what makes it especially like a soap opera. If you are a fan of Mrs. Mike and see this in the library, check it out and read it, but otherwise don't waste your money on this piece of crap book."
2,The Magic has been lost,I first read the wonderful story of Mrs Mike as a ten year old child growing up in an isolated northern community. Every few years I have gone back to recapture the magic and enjoy the wonderful descriptions of joy and hardships growing up in Northern Canada. It was with great anticipation that I looked forward to a continuation of the story. Although the story was enjoyable it failed to recapture the magic. The main characters did not have the depth of the original story and many of the terms and viewpoints used in the novel make it a story that would be more believable in a modern setting rather than in the 1940's.
4,Mrs. Mike Continues,"For those of you who have had the joy of reading Mrs. Mike, you will find this second part very different. This is still a tale of survival but not in the wilderness. I found I cried and smiled much less than the first book. But this one still works. It's the tale of Kathy aka Oh Be Joyful's Daughter. She is grown up now and heading off to Montreal to become a nurse in World War II. It is her survival as an Indian woman in a world of mostly white people. It's funny though: you do tend to forget she if First Nations. Once she becomes entrenched in the war, no one sees her nationality anymore. She has many trials and tribulations to survive through. She learns what it's like to be a true Indian, she learns of love and loss. She learns the world can be a cruel and unforgiving place. And she teaches the reader all of that as well."
3,Don't expect Mrs. Mike,"You will thoroughly enjoy this book if you don't expect it to be Mrs. Mike and if you are looking for a fluffy, easy-to-read escape from reality. Even though the writing is mediocre and sometimes overly dramatic, I still found myself racing through the pages to find out who what happens next. It was a guilty pleasure that I don't regret buying!"
3,I stand in line with all the others........,"Was this really written by the same authors of Mrs. Mike? I find it poorly put together and very hard to believe. I never ""like"" the character I am reading about. I don't understand her. I plodded through the book anyway, hoping that somewhere it would turn up good. But, unfortunately, that never happened. I have not read the third book in this saga yet, and am hesitant to do so. I may just stick with reading Mrs. Mike over and over."
3,"Could never equal the original, but still an okay read...","I read MRS. MIKE for the very first time recently and it has quickly joined my top ""5 best books ever"" list. Therefore, no matter what, I don't think this book could have ever equaled it in any way. There was a lot of good writing here and a good story, but it got bogged down. Personally, I would have liked some parts to have been shortened and others expanded upon. I would have loved to have heard more about Kathy's growing up with Mrs. Mike and Sgt. Mike and the twins and more about what happened with Crazy Dancer and the daughter. Overall, it was an enjoyable read."
5,Can't Wait for the Next book!,"Evil Lord Sparr has frozen all of Jaffa City up and it is up to Eric, Neal, Julie, and Princess Keeah to save Jaffa City and the rest of Droon. If the problem isn't hard enough already the only weapon they have is snowballs! The problem gets worse when the great wizard Galen Longbeard is frozen up. Will the kids save Jaffa City? Can they unfreeze Galen Longbeard? I highly recommend this book because it is a great page turner!"
5,Secrets of Droon #5 review,"I really liked this book. It shows how kids can do something. It shows that because evil Lord Sparr has put an ice spell on Jaffa City and most things,except for the kids so they have to save the day. The main caractors are Keeah, a wizard and princess from Droon, Eric, a boy from the Upper World,Neal, another boy from the Upper World and Julie, a girl from the Upper World. There are also other caracters. It was a very good book."
4,Cool Concept,Absolutely blown away... classic rock tunes with the swing sound from before my time. Neat idea. Brings a fresh sound to the pop songs.
5,WHAT A SESSION!!!,Exciting! Intelligent! A (very young) man who knows how to make his world your world! Definitely one to own. I can't wait to hear more from this guy...
2,Curly top/ stowaway/little miss broadway and wee willie winkle,I can only view these dvd@s on old dvd player(bush). I cant play them on sony Pl/re.I wasnt informed of customs charge of 14 For 4 videos of the four dvds . wee willie winkle had no lable on dvd. though all had security tag on
5,"A fine, exciting film","This is not your typical Shirley Temple film - it is closer to the style of its director John Ford. It is an exciting, action & comedy-packed highly recommended film, even for non-Shirley fans. Please note that it is Not widescreen. And price is too high, should be closer to $10."
2,Very disappointing.,"This book is designed for a first time traveller -- over half of it was advice about weather, shots, and traveller's checks. Detail about where to go and what to see is disappointing -- it only gives a very general outline about it country (they seem to all have jungles, mountains, and ruins) and then recommends other guide books. If you are only buying 1-2 guide books, just buy the other ones."
1,Reader's Digest Quality,"This is Lonely Planet Lite, all of it material cribbed and repackaged from other Lonely Planet guides on the region, and in many cases the summaries grossly distort what appears in the individual country guides. It's like drinking non-alcoholic beer--so diluted that there's no satisfaction in it--and some of the original wasn't all that great to start with."
3,Too light.. a disappointment,I was a bit disappointed in this book. This writer has the ability to produce much better work. This was just a bit like a coconut meringue pie without the coconut. I wouldn't recommend this book.
5,Lord Peter Wimsey - Five Red Herrings.,The DVD I received was in very good condition - however Five Red Herrings had a Part1-2 and a Part 3-4. I only received the one disc package - Part 1-2. Fortunately I was able to purchase Part 3-4 at a local Half Price Book Store . I feel that it was not made clear that there would only be part of the series. Did I miss something in the advertising?
4,Great Book,"I recently read this book, and I enjoyed it. It is a great book for beginners and advanced breakers. I learned a lot from this book, and it is written very well. The only thing that prevented this great book from getting five stars, is the clarity of the instructions. I think the author should have been more clear on SOME of the trick explanations. All in all, this is an excellent book, and I definietely reccomend this book to others."
2,Actual Size Ain't Much,"Peggy Stern plays piano and leads a septet with trumpet-trombone-tenor front men. All compositions are original. Recording is OK, but not great. Players are competent, but not great. Tunes are a little hard to get your arms around, but they kind of grow on you. The best you can say of this album is that it works hard to break new ground. The tunes are worth listening to, the arrangements are different (although not all that good), but I tired of trying to find anything real likable about the sessions."
3,would pay more for better quality,"Having squared-off feet and being unable to wear most shoes, I own several pairs of these. The tops are plastic mesh embroidered with sequins and beads, the soles are flexible rubber. In addition to being very flattering and complementary to any outfit, they are extremely comfortable. For $4 one should not expect much, and accordingly, after a few wearings, the embroidery is coming out, the bottoms are wearing away, and the front of the top is splitting. It's a great concept and I would be willing to pay a lot more for something that will last. Also, the price here on Amazon is no bargain. The local pharmacy charges the same thing and they are not noted for being inexpensive."
5,Plumpee Penguin is perfect,"This is awesome. It's soft and fluffy and cracks me up every time I see my 14yr old daughter carrying it around. She loves it, so I do as well...."
5,i can't wait to see it live,"If there you looked up ""great album"" in te dictionary, this would have to be there. Be looking for this album at next years grammys."
4,The Art of War,"I enjoy reading for different cultures. This book is about day-to-day challenges whether it was in business, politics, sports, or in social life. I would love to see such a great book in hard cover. It is a book to keep."
1,FORGET IT,"This hard cover book was totally erroneous.The cover showed as advertised but the inside had a completely different book in it.The inside book was ""The Art of Cockfighting"".PICK ANOTHER ADDITION.Amazon did send me a shipping label and refunded my money but it was still inconvenient to have to repack it and bring it back to UPS for mailing."
4,Still good advice,"What impress me most is that you can translate in today's terms and it is still good advice. Compare with what is actually happening in the world, and see bye yourself.Good thinking never age."
4,Really Insightful,"If you plan on going to war, whether it be in your everyday life or literally, this is the book read."
3,nice,"The edited version of ""Terms"" is lovely. The album version is good in it's own right, but is really drawn out and not at all as good as what Sarah is capable of.The Violin Mixed ""Shelter"" is unmatched and become one of my favorite Sarah songs, but the album version of ""Terms"" is really not that great. They should have used another mix or another track altogether."
3,Really a personal diary,"I got this book expecting that it would be about the development of Geology, or the development of the Earth. I was surprised to find that it is really a travel book about his experiences going places of geological interest. I am sure that this will be of interest to many people. It wasn't to me. I could not read past the first chapter. There were too many wanderings and side issues. It was like reading a fashion column to get the political news. Someone will like all of the extraneous and unrelated details about quaint places they might visit and appreciate. I was looking for something less personal and more informative about a more limited topic."
2,A Fine Example of the Word Pedantic,"Argh - hoping to find a good survey of the geologic processes behind the Earth we know today but written for a non-geologist, I found his writing unfocused, tortured and pedantic -especially for someone who claimed to be targeting the geological neophyte. Just ghastly and dry. I suspect Mr Fortey's editor was handing out bonuses for using words that only 1 in 3 Phds had any chance of recognizing. Mr Fortey must have picked up enough money on this incentive for a nice gourmet dinner.This is an easy book to set aside. Just pick up a college geology text book and you will be better off!"
2,A cure for insomnia,"While I enjoy geology, it is not my profession. I am interested in expanding my knowledge but have no intention of becoming a geologist. I found this book so boring that I was unable to finish it. It reads very much like a textbook. It certianly contains a great deal of information, but it is related in such a dull fashion that it simply could not keep my interest. I was expecting something more along the lines of John McPhee who writes in an informative but entertaining manner. This fits the first bill but not the second."
1,Bosch 1199VSR,"I bought this drill a couple of years ago and drilled 6-8 1/2"" holes for concrete anchors. I went to use it today to drill some 3/8"" holes in my garage floor and within 10 seconds it stopped working. I took the back plate off and checked it for current. No issue there. I looked online and it looks like these drills are notorious for burning out the fwd/rev switch. Nice, a Perfectly good drill stops working the second time you use it. I'll be buying DeWalt or Milwaukee from now on. These drills are garbage."
1,junk,This is the third 1199vsr i have tried and i could not get 5 minutes of drilling out of any of them! They are JUNK!
2,"Appreciated, but not Appealing","First of all, let me say that I love Mel Torme. Especially when it comes to his 1950's collaborations with arranger Marty Paich (Swings the Shubert Alley, Sings Fred Astair, etc.). And indeed, this is one of those collaborations. But that's where the similarity ends. To me, Mel is a jazz singer...and one of the best. Sure, he co-wrote The Christmas Song and a few other standards. But while I appreciate what he was trying to do here, I just don't get it. This 40 minute piece, described by Mel as a ""lyrical and musical narrative dedicated to the Golden State"" is just out of character. It's part Broadway score, part Vaudeville act, part jazz opera? I'm just not sure but I didn't like it at all. The two stars are for Mel's performance (strong as always) and that of his first rate west coast back up musicians like Paich, Don Fagerquist, Dave Pell et al. If you're looking for more swinging Mel from the 50's, don't look here."
4,Good movie/great performance by Rekha,"The film has many great moments which manage to tug at your heartstrings. My favourite scene is when the kids dedicate a song to their ""dead"" mother on their parents day at school, while she is sitting there all tearful. I was very surprised to see Rekha's transformation; the first time Jyoti appears on-screen comes across as a complete shocker (in the most positive sense of the word). Another moving moment is when the boy meets Aarti and notices the similarity between ""this woman"" and his own mother but the absence of the birthmark on her face disproves him. Same with the scene when her dog runs towards her. The film's last scene is extremely touching. The second part is overall full of great moments. All in all, if you have not watched Khoon Bhari Maang yet, I highly recommend you to do so. It is a fantastic dramatic thriller with an all-time great performance by Rekha."
2,You've gotta LOVE Tony Bennett,"If you don't love Tony Bennett and you want to get a compilation of Rodgers and Hart sung by the same person, I'd turn your eyes and ears to Ella Fitzgerald's two disc set. Now THAT is fantastic! This is too loungy for me. Throughout every song, Bennett can't just sing the song. He has to give you a constant reminder that it's HIM singing.Just how live versions of songs aren't nearly as good as studio recordings because the live versions always seem to have an annoying twist to a song that makes it hard to sing to, Tony Bennett does the same thing with this set.I don't know if he's trying to make love to his audience or just lounge their ears, but he's definitely not just singing the songs. Ella Fitzgerald just sings the songs, and by doing so, with her voice and talent, sings their songs perfectly.If you love it loungy and you're in love with Tony, well, here you go."
5,What a set! Linda Ronstadt totally rocks!,"I love Linda Ronstadt so much! She has an amazing voice, and is one of my favorite singers. I only knew two or three songs before I got this set, and I now I know about 10 or 20! Here are some songs I would recommend you to hear.Winter Light (from her album ""Winter Light"" and from the Secret Garden, 1993)Don't Know Much (with Aaron Neville)Somewhere Out There (with James Ingram and on the An American Tail Soundtrack)Blue BayouHigh Sierra (with Dolly Parton and Emmylou HarrisI Never Will Marry (with Dolly Parton)All I Have to Do is Dream (with Kermit the Frog)Dreams to Dream (from the An American Tail: Fievel Goes West Soundtrack)When You Wish Upon A StarMy Funny ValentineTelling Me Lies (with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris)This is a great set! Buy it today!"
5,The Best Music By The Best Singer,"The Linda Ronstadt box set is a wonderful collection of songs. My favorite song is ""Dreams To Dream."" That is a beautiful song from ""Fieval Goes West."" It has a lot hit songs from her long career, along with some rarities. If you like Linda Ronstadt, but don't know what album to buy, this would be the one. It has everything on it. It is truly a 5 star album."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD,"Linda is a very arrogant performer, who kicks her fans down (Or at least those of us who are Republicans and (Or) Christian Conservatives), because she thinks we are inferior. So I would never buy any of her CDs again (And I was a 30 year Ronstadt (Country and rock fan)). As for this CD, not putting ""Silver Threads And Golden Needles"" on it, is enough of a reason not to purchase it in the first place. Throw in her Mexican material (That is not on the level of Thalia or Jennifer Pena (Let alone Selena)), and the boring Nelson Riddle material that became passe when ELVIS came out. I would sooner listen to Hilliary Duff, Brittney Spears and argggggggggg Paulia Rubio, before I would listen to this CD (Let alone buy it), if I could give it ZERO stars I would. It is simply the worst boxed set I ever heard (And I know most of the material on it)."
5,Excellent Overview of Ronstadt's Tremendous Talent,"This box set contains many rarities and unreleased tracks, as well as a great overview of her solo albums and collaborations with others. It focuses on ALL of Ronstadt's musical genres, not just on rock. Hence, it is missing some of her (rock) hits, so it would help to get (or keep) her 2 Greatest Hits albums for a complete hits collection. But you won't feel cheated by this box. It covers rock, pop, country, folk, Mexican canciones, Latin pop, Early Americana, lullabies, operetta, and standards from the Great American Songbook. And the rarities disc alone is worth the price. Ronstadt possesses one of the greatest voices of our generation, and her incredible work gathered in this box is all the proof anyone needs."
3,"Great Voice, Imperfect Choice","Linda Ronstadt has dominated radio airwaves all over the world for more than thirty years. I own some of her albums, and being interested in outtakes & rare tracks by excellent performers such as Linda Ronstadt I was looking forward to the release of the four-CD set.The biggest disappointment, apart from some very awkward selections, was the lack of background information which is usually an additional & very welcome bonus for fans willing to spend that much money on a single item. This box sets offers you some nice (though not very recent)pictures but very little on musician credits or recording dates.Linda Ronstadt has recorded some exceptionally fine music (she did miracles with Jimmy Webb tunes, for example) but also a lot of tracks way below her talent - and this exactly what this box set reflects."
5,Does the job on a small space,Does exactly what it supposed to do. Saved our entry way from the mountain of shoes. Used in coat closet (small space)
4,"Good shoe storage, a bit small I would say.","If you have basketball shoes, skateboarding etc..might be a little tight. Says large but seems to be rather on the smaller side I think.Overall seems like it is great quality and does the job for my running and casual shoes!!! Fast shipping!!!Amazon is A+ as always!"
1,not happy,"the item I received was not the 1 pictured. the product was only 5 x 12 inches, was made of sheer fabric, and had a velcro loop for hanging. sending it back as it was not what I expected and paid for."
3,works as advertised,It will do what it says and organize your shoes but I wish that this was a bit wider because my dress shoes will scuff against each other when storing then in this. I guess I'll just keep my good shoes on the closet floor.
4,"Nice, somewhat overpriced for what it is",Good size and looks nice. Somewhat overpriced for what it is and the quality of the materials. It might make sense to look for cheaper alternatives elsewhere.
5,Diner's Guide to Wines,"This is a great book for those of us who know little about wine, but need to know the right wines to serve with certain dishes. It's easy to read, and gives practical advice plus basic wine information."
4,This is a good book.,"If you¡ve studied statistics before, then this is a good reference book to do statistical analysis with mathematica. This book has many examples and considerably decent explanations. I found some errors in data in the accompanying CD. One (census.txt) of them is very bad; others are annoying but can be overcome easily. Also this book has several typos, which are annoying. However, this book helps readers harness the power of mathematica for statistics."
3,Pretty good book but DO NOT READ ANY OF THESE OTHER REVIEWS!,"The worst thing you can do with this book is read the storyline before you pick it up! The ""twist"" is the essence of the book and the reviews which revealed this twist and the story basically ruined what would have been a much more enjoyable experience for me, had I discovered them myself. So leave NOW! Do not read any other review here!"
2,Bewildering,"Myra Breckenridge is a vicious novel. I did not see any humor in a novel about a transexual who sexually harasses her male student, sodomizes him, and then steals his girlfriend by lying. Throughout, there are wild speculations about sexuality, novels and movies. The whole thing appears to have been made up to provoke people but to what purpose? Vidal reminded me of a certain type of very intelligent person who exists who says outrageous things just to get attention and a charge out of people. Since they are insincere in what they say, once you catch on to the game they turn out to be bores and pretty pathetic. Myra herself typifies the kind of fascist mentality that would never allow her, a transexual, to exist. I didn't laugh once at this one. Myron had a few laughs, however. Again, this pretentious transexual causes havoc (mainly on a movie set) but some of it is so juvenile that it is funny in places."
1,A Product Failure,"I'm an average build guy. I'm 5'10"" and 170 Lbs. I bought the product, received the product and unpackaged the product like it said, which was essentially just letting it set for 48 hours before use.After about the 3rd use, the indention of my body never recovered. The indention actually became permanent. I originally thought that this was normal. However, after continued use, I noticed that my back AND now neck were more sore than before I started using this memory foam. My theory would suggest that when my body falls back into the permanent indention, the effect of having my head and neck ""raised"" above normal due to the fact that my head would not create an indention, my back and now neck are significantly out of alignment.I would not recommend this product at all."
1,Edward Humes is an excellent storyteller!,"I have lived in Mississippi for nearly 20 years, and I followed the Sherry murders closely. I do not condone crime nor those who commit them, however, it is obvious that Mr. Humes is simply a brilliant storyteller. I will not begin to criticize his writing ability. The sad thing is that he would be much better off writing Mother Goose fairy tales than a story that is supposed to be based on factual events. I think the majority of people in Mississippi realize that you must look deeper than the surface to find the truth, and this book barely scratches the surface. I have been involved with law enforcement for more than 9 years now, and I have enough to experience to recognize a set up when I see one. Gambling was not the only thing Margartet Sherry was trying to put a stop to, and people need to realize this. Yet I truly believe that the ""truth will prevail."" My heart goes out to the Sherry family, and I just hope that the one day the true killers are found."
1,Disapointed,"I was disapointed in the literary quality of a book payed so much attention. I found it dry with poor balance. I don't know about the characters outside of this book but saw it one sided enough to make a TV movie of the week out of it. That is not a compliment. Most good books are to complex to transfer over to film. I did notice from the reviews that the ""good"" reviewers seem to have a more personal attachment than did others."
1,This book was written only for financial purposes.,"I think it is a disgrace to have the book Mississippi Mud listed under the section labeled true crime. I realize that the daughter of the victims has suffered a great loss, but I think she has taken what people tell her to be fact. Anyone who has ever studied crime knows that to find the truth you have to look farther than the F.B.I. or the press. I think this is truly sad, and hopefully one day for the families sake the truth will be found. Until then, however, people will go on to believe the lies they read in this novel."
2,The book makes a complete mockery of true journalism.,"The book Mississippi Mud should definitely be listed in the section labeled crime fiction. Anyone who has a firsthand knowledge of any of the characters discussed in the book would know that the book is a complete mockery. I had researched the topic of the book, which is the murders of Judge Sherry and his wife, and found barely seventeen percent of this book to be fact. Therefore, a person who enjoys reading true stories that actually occurred how they are written should stear clear of this so- called novel. To say it bluntly, anyone looking for a book similar to this would be more satisfied with a John Grisham novel."
1,This book does not even deserve a star!,"I can't understand why anyone would waste the time it would take to write a good review of this book. A reader would be just as happy with the Hardy Boys collection. I live close to where the murders occurred, and I personally believe the truth will never be found. It is obvious, however, after reading this novel that the author did not come close to writing an account of true crime. I would recommend that readers value their time and stay away from this novel."
1,"A wretched, dishonest hatchet job","This book is a prime example of a writer deciding the outcome of a story, then manipulating and omitting selected facts to ""prove"" his particular theory. Although my role was a bit part, I was the media consultant to then Biloxi Mayor Pete Halat in July of 1989 when the accusations were made. This book does not portray the way things happened. It is sympathetic to the Sherry's daughter's accusations to a point where even the least attentive reader would have to question the integrity to the ""journalism"" supposedly found within this book. This book is all heat and no light, and is one that is a wate of both time and money."
5,Great and Truthful Book,"A Wonderful Book. I lived in Saucier MS, not far from Biloxi, approx. 20 minutes. And everything you read in the book is true to the T. No half-truth's or lies. The state and the towns are still crooked. But what town or state isn't? A great book to read and one that is hard to put down. I remommend: no TV, a quiet room, and a soft light. Sometimes A & E will have a special about the Sherry Murders. Have a wonderful Read!"
4,Bloody mud,"This comes across like something from the thirties without the Klan masks. Humes loves to go after town hall, and we can thank him for that. Biloxi, Mississippi, corrupt, decadent, stupid, ""a sewerage"" as one of its citizens called it, is put on trial here and found quite guilty. One of the most remarkable things about this book is the account of the scam against gay men conducted from Angola prison by Kirksey Nix and other criminals. They made hundreds of thousands of dollars with just telephone calls. Unlike most of the true crime books I have been reading, the characters here are hardened professional criminals, true hit men, etc. The stupid, greedy, sick characters of the other stories are here represented by a couple of corrupt lawyers, Halat and Sherry, the former, also a one-time mayor of Biloxi and the latter, one of the murder victims. Humes is a superior writer in the true crime genre."
2,"Too much emphasis on drama, not enough substance","While I would credit the author for capturing the atmosphere of Biloxi's seedier side, a good portion of this book's text is creative writing. Readers should realize that despite the author's belief that Mr. Ransom was the trigger man, a wholly unremarkable thug has confessed to the Sherry murders-and he is anything but the mysterious professional that the author writes about.Many details are glossed over in this book, and it is a shame that a writer would try to dramatize such a terrible crime, when a factual telling of the story would have been all the more compelling."
4,"Reads like a crock pot , not a microwave.","If you can get past the repetitiveness of the first 150-200 pages, you are in for a first-rate Southern mystery. Once the characters of the Dixie Mafia are introduced in detail, you get that ""creepy"" fix all of us true crime fanatics need to savor. The extensive footnotes are at times helpful, at times annoying (use two bookmarks.) After you read the book, re-read some of the reviews below and try to guess the guilty parties' handiwork."
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny!,I was among the fortunate guests who were at this event and it was a night I will never forget. We had a fantastic time laughing with the members of The Wealth Building Annex and the Tampa Bay business community in general. Done in the style of the old Dean Martin classics - this is an awesome edition to anyone's laughter library!
5,Echapee Belle,"As already noted this CD is incorrectly titled as live. It is, in fact, a US release by Nettwerk Records of ""Echapee Belle"" (Beautiful Escape), the bands 1996 release from la village verte.Beautiful melodies and sexy vocals. If you're looking for gourmet this isn't it but if you like fast food from time to time Autour de Lucie will hit the spot. It's not just burgers and fries though. Vallerie Leuillot's lyrics are heart felt and often haunting, her storytelling being reminiscent of the style of Harriet Wheeler. In fact it is probably not unfair to compare the band's sound to that of The Sundays (although all comparisons are a little unfair)."
5,Sleepy Hollow AKA N. Tarrytown Ancestors,"This book is awesome if you know you have ancestors buried at the Old Dutch Church in N. Tarrytown, Also now known as Sleepy Hollow. I found my ancestors were buried here and I am very excited to read the inscriptions in this book!"
5,A Subconscious Masterpiece!,This is the best compilation album on the market right now. Buy It! If you are even a little into electronic music... Buy It! It blew my mind & still does! :-} Highly recommended Anyway.
3,Only some new material,"I had heard some of his material on XM radio, and his stuff is very, very funny. I ended up buying 2 of his CDs at the same time. What I didn't realize is that there is a large overlap of the same material from the CD ""If you buy this CD, I can buy this car"" to this HBO performance. Of the 2, I would recommend this one...but not both!"
4,Just to recap,"Firstly this is ADULTS ONLY, Roberts explicit descriptions paint a vivid image in your mind you may not be able to erase.This is more or less a complilation of his previous work with some new materaial added.I hope he releases some a new CD soon.I first found a small audio clip of Robert Schimmel, and this sparked me to look into getting more of his stand up comedy.See if you can find a clip like I did to help you make up your mind, it is along the lines of Andrew Dice Clay so it's not for everyone.Unlike Andrew Dice Clay, Robert is down to earth with a family realising his body has changed over the years. His jokes are mostly focused on himself and has a unique view of certain situations doctors office, driving instructions, vets, his daughters boyfriend, the internet...I can put this CD on months later and I still laugh just as hard as the first time I heard it.Highly Recommended remember ADULTS ONLY."
5,Schimmel is a great rising comedian.,"I'm a die hard George Carlin fan and when I saw Robert Schimmel's HBO special, Unprotected, I knew I had to have the CD. This is a great album for any fan of non-sugarcoated comedy such as that of Carlin and Leary. But note that Schimmel isn't as ""negative"" as Carlin and Leary. Rather, Schimmel hits on more ""personal"" topics to entertain his audience and it works! This is definately a must-buy CD!"
2,It's not a keeper,"I was looking to save my 10 year old son some of his birthday money so I shopped around for the best deal I could find. The Samsung YP-T8X 512 MB Music and Movie Player was the best deal I found with all the features he wanted. The Samsung is a nice looking gadget with all the bells and whistles but it's feature are hard to use. The software that operates the music downloads is not user friendly. When the program is opened on your computer, the window opens bigger than my moniter. The buttons you need to click are not visable, therefore you need to drag the window up to access the buttons. As soon as you release the left click on the mouse, the window that moves the page up falls right back down, once again not allowing you access to the buttons you need to download music and videos.In my opinion, spend a little more money and shop for a quality device with user friendly software."
2,Great player but doesn't age well,"I loved everything about the player as far as the usability, versatility, and style. I did have a problem with how frequently and seriously it was broken. After a few months of ownership the connection point for the USB port became loose and had to be held in a certain way in order to charge or put music on. Less than the first year (luckily still under warranty) I had to send it to Samsung for the earphone jack to be fixed. They did fix everything but the USB port became loose again and remained that way until it gave up life less than 2 years. Bottomline, Samsung makes crappy products. I do not recommend."
2,Mmmmmmm,Didn'tlove it. It wasn't really helpful to me. It WS more like weigh training in general. Im not going to return it cuz its a hasstle
4,A MUST for the Sarah fan,"If I had to buy this album again I would. ""Into the Fire"" and ""Sad Clown"" are perfectly lovely songs. My favorite song,though is ""Black"". It's absolutely perfect and beautiful. The words are great the strings make the song and of course there is that beautiful voice. This song alone is worth the money."
3,A gem for only one song,"The first song is just the album version. If you really like it, you still don't need it on two CD's. The BBC session of ""Sad Clown"" is just too much like the original to need another version. The last song though, is truly a gem for me. The pulling from the string quartet in the background tears the emotion from Sarah's angelic voice. The background vocalist harmonizes so well that you don't just hear the words, but you feel them as well. If only it could have been a little longer..."
3,"""Sad clown"" and ""Into the fire"" spectacular; ""Black"" bleccch","""Sad clown"" and ""Into the fire"" are great performances of Sarah's, but ""Black"" is something one can do without. It's remarkably unappealing, featuring drawn out vocals and music that is very, very hard to like. I'm surprised the previous reviewer enjoyed it, but more power to him. It depends on your p.o.v. Mine didn't like it one bit. Seeing as it's only 3 tracks, i cannot let the one posionous third piece drag the whole album down, but I'll be damned if it didn't."
2,Poor Quality Sizing Die,"Bought this .308 die set to load more consistant loads. Sizing die's expander ball would not center when tightened because of extremely loose threads. They caused the expander to be off center by nearly 1/16"". It was so bad there was some concern the decapping pin would hit the primer correctly.Sent the set to RCBS and they made no correction or replacement. The just tightened the jam nut and sent it back a few weeks later with no explaination. One would not expect a Competition die to be built this poorly. No other brand of dies I own are made with threads this sloppy. I lost money by returning it, so I'll no longer buy RCBS dies in the future if this is how they handle these issues. Very dissapointed with RCBS.A Glenn, MSME"
1,I wish it were longer or they asked real questions,"They interviewed two hypnotherapists, didnt ask them about the abductee cases, just chit chatted about questions that we all know the answers to. It was very boring."
2,Not worth it,"Not one of Fox's best musicals. A mostly talented cast, including Carmen Miranda, is wasted on a dumb script and even dumber musical numbers. There was a war on and obviously Hollywood was short on leading men. This film is a prime example of a rush to put out a film with little money and less entertainment value."
4,"This or Chilton's six of one, half a dozen of the other","This is similar to the Chilton's book in format and completeness. Still can't figure out how to replace the speedometer cable. Better for someone a little above my amateur status, but essential if you have an older vehicle without an owner's manual. Doesn't include everything ( I still don't know what a couple of the buttons on the dash do) but is as complete as Chilton's with better photographs. You just don't need both. Anyone out there with a Comanche manual?"
4,Haynes Manual,"This manual, as always across multiple makes and models, serves as a good basis for nearly all home repairs. This particular book was shipped as promised and in the condition advertised. Overall, this was a positive transaction for me."
4,Royal Crest Gold Plated Flatware,"The flatware is extremely nice - you would never think twice about using it for the special family dinner or get together. The flatware is good weight -- not too heavy, not too light. It holds up well to use -- I would not recommend washing with any type of abrasive scrapper or the dishwasher. But if you wash it with a cloth, then dry .. then air dry over night - you will have many years of great use.The one drawback to this item was the storage box. The knife storage in the lid pulled out - due to the weight of the knives. Stil - easily fixable.I would still rank this an exceptional deal for the price."
5,The Creators Of Industrial,"Skinny puppy Are the Creators of Modern Industrial Music. Brap is a perfect example of music that influenced everyone from NIN, Ministry, Front Line Assembly, Kmfdm and everyone inbetween. Skinny puppy were way ahead of their time. Even today I'd still say that most of their music does'nt get the respect that is deserves because people have never heard anything like it. I'm a music lover...and I can appreciate music that is ""diffrent"". If you want to know what influenced Trent reznor of ""NIN"" or Al jourgenson of ""Ministry"" Buy this cd. If you ask me.....I'd say that Skinny Puppy were one of the most amazing and influential bands of all time. When you listen to this double cd....you will understand what I mean. Skinny Puppy would be stars today if they were still around...Unfortunately they have passed. R.I.P SP"
5,"good avant garde ""industrial"" music","""Uranus Cancelled"" is epic and classic, ""Love in Vein"" is epic and classic, ""Deadlines"" is classic, ""Tin Omen"" version tears the house down!! ""Carry"" is classic. Good version of ""Last Call."" ""Grave Wisdom,"" ""Natures Revenge""--classic songs. Good ""TFWO."" Good ""Convulsion."" ""Spasmolytic"" is untouchable version. Multimedia on discs is fun to look at, too."
5,this is great stuff,"if you have no idea what Skinny Puppy is......then for the love of Ogre!...be patient. The first few listens are probably going to be odd or somewhat painful. I usually stay away from things that have to grow on me.....but I was drawn into them somehow...probably curiosity. IF! you have some kind of an open mind with music...you will aquire the taste for Skinny Puppy....and all it's wonderful glory!.my favorite tracks include: Grave Wisdom, Tin Omen, TFWO, and Double Cross...all the tracks are awesome, And I would go so far as to say that this collection is a proper introduction to Skinny Puppy."
5,Not your usual Puppy,"This CD, specifically #3, is incredible. When I put this on, I always end up sitting perfectly placed in front of my speakers, reveling in it's, for lack of a better word, beauty. It is fantastic."
5,Must have for Puppy fans,"There is nothing wrong with this double-CD set. In fact I would have bought it if all that was on it was ""Uranus Cancelled"". The chance to hear pre-mixed synth lines from Knowhere is the best thing to happen to me as a fan of Last Rights! Proves SP does care about not only about it's fans, but more importantly, it's music!!!"
3,A Well-Written Novel,"I had high hopes for this book, and most of them it fulfilled. The book itself is well-written with personable language that made me feel the story and its characters as if I was going through their turmoil. Reading through the descriptions of Joshua made him such a real character to me and that alone made me reconsider my previous decision never to have children. The ending of the book, though, turned me off from ever reading it again - and that is one of the most important qualities in a good book for me. Though a gripping story (I read the entire book in one night), I won't pick it up again. I honestly do not recommend it unless you are the type who reads to get their heart broken."
3,Poor editing detracts from decent story,"A good plot, and a timely one. However, some poor editing and word choice (ambiguous antecedents, inept analogies, an overabundance of medical/technical information - accurate but a bit of a slog) detract and distract from the narrative. A lot more ""tell"" than ""show."" The story really only picks up in the last third. I enjoyed this as a decent beach read, but I probably will not ever pick it up again."
5,It's no wonder massive warships capture the wonder of many.,"Thousands of tons of steel floating along the ocean to crush its enemies. It's no wonder massive warships capture the wonder of many. ""The Battlecruiser HMS Hood: An Illustrated Biography 1916-1941"" is a look at one of the world's most famous warships, the HMS Hood. Completely and comprehensively covering the ship's deck plans, the technology used to construct it, and its weapons, ""The Battlecruiser HMS Hood"" is enhanced with well over two hundred photographs in both black and white and color. ""The Battlecrusier HMS Hood"" is highly recommended for military, nautical, photography, and history community library collections, and to anyone who looks on these ships with awe.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,Long awaited movies!!,"The movies I ordered came in brand new condition, and I enjoyed watching every minute of the hilarious 80's classics. I actually went on a pre-order list for the movies at BB.com. Needless to say I never received my movies after they were released for sale, due to a supply shortage. I came to amazon, and ordered the same product. I received my movies within a week. I was floored by the response time alone..... Service at amazon was stellar."
1,A sad waste of time and money,"No time or inclination to go into all the problems with this book, but I bought it based on all the great reviews and I have to admitt that I have been completely duped and other readers deserve to be warned. The dialog is stilted, the plot is tired, and the writing just seems so self-concious. The characters were distinctly unendearing, a very bad thing in a romance. The attempts at humor fell flat. I'm sure Caskie is a nice lady, but I won't buy another book written by her. Save your time and money. I'm glad I have some other books to move on to."
1,surprised how much I disliked it,"I might be more charitable if this book hadn't been advertised as the greatest thing since sliced bread. To me, it read like someone just learning how to write a romance novel and I had a really hard time fnishing it. The characters had no depth and the plotline was just ridiculous. I'm hard pressed to see what's ""sparkling"" about any of it. In fact, I was annoyed that I'd spent money on this. I actually felt a little guilty for feeling this way since this book was touted so highly and then I came here and saw that a lot of people felt this way about this book. It's kind of weird. It's like they think if they just tell us it's wonderful we'll all believe them like a bunch of sheep."
2,Cardboard Regency,"You know when someone has a good joke and doesn't expand upon it and just tries to stretch this same joke as long as they can til it stopped being funny, oh about twenty minuted ago? Well, that's Rules of Engagement by Kathryn Caskie in a nutshell. In this specific instance, playing on the saying ""All's fair in love and war."" Caskie takes the cute idea of using a military text as a how-to manual for getting engaged and stretches it, stretches it . . . wait for it . . . and stretches it some more until she gets to the requisite 300 pages. And the author barely makes that 300 pages mark despite what Amazon sez. It leads to an arduous read because other than the amusing epigrams from the military text that starts each chapters, this novel is so paper-thin. The hero, the heroine, the two aunts and the basic plot are all cardboard cutouts. No historical atmosphere, of course (not that I was expecting any). Only that one good germ of an idea and it's not enough."
3,"Good, but not worth precious time","IF you have very few time to actually sit down and read a good book, then skip this one. It was good, but not great. I agree with the comments listed. If you love this author then you may love this book, as it seems to be on level with the only other one I've read. However, if you are looking for a great regency book to fix your craving try something else like Judith McNaught, Lisa Kleypas, Julia Quinn or Jacqui D'Alessandro."
2,Didnt like it.,"I bought this book because of the reviews it got, but man. I almost had to break my own arm to finish reading it. See, here's the thing. There are some really good moments with the plot. Some of it was engaging and humerous. Thats it. I did not like the characters, their personalities, what little of their lives you see beyond the story. They were not alive enough. Grace grated a nerve, Magnus or whatever was a jerk half the time and Eliza was a ninny. I finished it so that I could see if it got any better at all, but although it was a very promising story, it flatlined in my book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If curiosity wins out, got to the library. Dont waste money."
2,I must be only person who didn't like this book,"I must be the only person in the world who didn't like this book. I eagerly read new authors, especially those who have won RWA's Golden Heart. I was happy to pick this on off the shelves; I love historicals.But, sorry, I didn't like it. I don't think I laughed at all. I love Julia Quinn and laugh at her books. But not this one. It didn't speak to me.The plot of the aunts was different, but the love story was typical. She wanted him, but couldn't marry him. He wanted her but couldn't marry her. blah... There was absolutely no internal reason that Magnus could not marry Eliza. He needed to marry a heiress, but that's an external reason. The last half of the book was Magnus' pursuit of Eliza. It got tedious."
3,Not what the reviews made it sound like,"I read this book mostly because it got good ratings. What a disappointment! The plot was so silly. The dialogue was poor. I didn't find anything witty about it. I was surprised to find several of my favorite author's names linked to the book. It may have been a debut, but I would have called it a dud and not delightful."
4,Very cute book!,"What a clever plot! I really enjoyed this book. I got it because it was a recommendation on an Amazon page, and I found it funny and sweet. I enjoy any character who's an artist, like Eliza. And give me a brogue any day... :) I think Kathryn Caskie can follow in the footsteps of Julia Quinn."

3,What happened to all the music?,"I watched the TV ""movie"" on VH1 that this soundtrack comes from, but why did they cut out so many songs? La Bamba, Grease, Great Balls of Fire, Time Warp, and Proud Mary, were the all I liked. And that's about half. It's a disco album with a few rock n' roll songs thrown in."
5,My most used cookbook for past 18+ yrs,"Got this recipe book as a college graduation present in 1994. I am sad to see it is now out of print. Everyone who loves food that bursts with flavor should get this book. It is basically the only cookbook I regularly use. I've tried many of the recipes multiple times. All are outstanding, with most of them easy to complete. I always get compliments when serving food from this book.Some of my favorites (all easy): grilled salmon w Chile-honey glaze (don't need to make the relish), gingered beef jerky,grilled chicken in the style of Vulcan,grilled eggplant and pepper sandwiches with black olive spread, and many others...Was inspired to look up this book on amzn after cooking two yummy recipes from this book on a recent hot summer weekend."
2,"I'll take it, Gregory J...","I understand Eileen Janssen plays a small part in it and I'd like to see how she developed as an actress. I'm only familiar with her as a promising child actress in an unfortunately short-lived kid series by Hal Roach, and some '50s Westerns.I can't really rate this DVD since I have not seen it. But I'll give it 2 stars simply because I'm interested in spotting a grown-up Janssen as well as crazy-cool Dennis Hopper before he really took off. Worth 2 stars to me for historical film trivia significance.Going to watch for it in the dollar bins."
5,"Twists and turns, human failure and hope","Couldn't put this down. The character development was amazing and I found myself feelingsad, angry and then hopeful and completely absorbed in the ""mystery"" of lives intertwining.This is not a light read. Irony and justice and the senselessness for those who fall throughthe cracks. And the beauty in some who are able to rise above it. This book will stretch you."
3,The genesis of a wonderful group of musicians.,I actually have this album on *vinyl*! This is an album of lively Irish music played plainly and simply by a group of very young women who have since matured both in self and in style.
4,Designing an effective program for women starts here.,"As a strength training professional, I heartily recommend this book as a great place to start your journey to your muscular fitness goals. Its greatest value is the identification of specific regimens for specific body types. Every woman is different and should be trained according to her frame and metabolic tendencies. Kennedy and Greenwood-Robinson have done a very admirable job at provide great examples from the major body types and the pictures are tasteful and inspiring. Good work!"
2,Not very useful,"Probably the strongest impression this book left me with is that it's great for ogling fitness models, if that's what you're looking for. Being a long-time reader of ""Shape"" magazine, I expected something much more geared toward women who are interested in their overall fitness and health. This book seemed more like a men's ""Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue"" with a little bit of fitness advice tossed in as an afterthought. There are far too many books of substance on this topic to bother with this one. Even a subscription to ""Shape"" magazine would be a better use of your money."
4,Great Book on Biodiesel Although not very Technical,"The author does a great job explaining what biodiesel is and how it compares to petroleum based diesel fuel. A major portion of this book reviews the biodiesel production / outlook in other countries which I was less interested in. Unfortunately, this book is not very technical and and only briefly goes through the process of making biodiesel...mainly referring to another book for that information. All in all, a great book that someone with no technical background could pick up and learn alot about the subject."
3,Enables Learning XML Fast,"The book/CD is very nice for learning XML fast, you can run many of the examples as you go through the material when using the CD, which enables you to learn it faster. The book and CD are not bogged down with useless detail (like the Wrox ""Professional XML"" book is). It's pretty straight to the point, but sometimes you need to go to other sources to fully understand or get more details.My only complaint is from description, I expected video presentations and great multimedia capabilities. The multimedia is mostly just explanations of sample code line by line and it is all audio, no video. Really you pay alot of extra money for a CD that has the same exact information as the book, so you may want to save some money and just by the book."
1,"Wrong concept, Good Book","This is a worst concept. The book is good. That's why 2 stars. For the book, alone, I would have given 4 stars. I wouldn't waste my money for any item in this series. Just buy the book."
5,CO CO Wheats,You can not find this item in the eastern part of Pennsylvania. I went to Pittsburgh at the beginning of the year and saw this item in a grocery store and bought 2 boxes. I could not believe it because I thought they stopped making it. We moved to the Philadelphia area about 30 years ago. I decided to order some from Amazon and I was glad I did. I love this cereal. I am 60 years of age but I love my coco wheats.
2,Biased against science.,"This is not a law text nor a history of science text but a sociology text. Her language shows a bias against scientific analysis, and in favor of sociologists (her profession): peer review is said to give an ""impartial facade""; scientific experts are said to have a ""technocratic bias."" Two other scholars are said to have ""complete disregard for findings in contemporary... sociology."" Science in general is said to have too high a reputation for credibility: ""science generally functions in an atmosphere of credulousness...""The implication is that courts should allow in all opposing scientific claims, since ""science"" has no claims to ""truth"" greater than any other profession.Only recommended for its survey of cases and judicial/regulatory opinions and trends over the last several decades."
4,"Clear, well-researched & useful","Sheila Jasanoff writes books that are well-researched, clear and useful for people in a variety of areas: public policy, science studies, law & society, biotech/analysis.I have read most of her books, and recommended this to (advanced) students, who also found it very useful.I probably would not have bothered to review it here: it is obviously good, and has been well received elsewhere. But I felt moved to counteract (what I regarded as) the highly misleading negative review printed below."
5,Pet Shop Boys - Remixed by Thunderpuss!,"Pet Shop Boys's catchy, Village People-inspired ""New York City Boy"" gets remixed by the internationally known remixing team of Thunderpuss (Chris Cox and Barry Harris). Cox and Harris give the disco stomper a club-friendly remix that also stays true to PSB's sound. Of course, there are other mixes on this CD, but the Thunderpuss mix is definitely the highlight. I bought this CD upon release, played it once, but I didn't pay much attention to the Thunderpuss mix until months later. Don't sleep on this winner!"
1,JUST PLAIN BAD!,"the pet shop boys fail miserably with a song that is just a retread of go west and a red letter day. been there, heard that before."
5,"Pet Shop Boys Score A Hit With ""New York City Boy""","This is a great dance record! The track perfectly captures the New York vibe and legitimately drags the vocals together with the violins and percussion. The gospel choir in the background is the icing on the cake. All in all, ""New York City Boy"" is a hot song, worth buying. Note: Listen for their current club hit ""I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More"". Another huge hit!"
2,"Portable, but uncomfortable","This pad is lightweight and very portable. Have been using it to camp around Africa. It provides warmth away from the ground. However, the major drawback is that it is uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I wish I had gone with a slightly heavier pad, if it helped with the comfort factor."
5,Handy!,"I bought this book to use in my English class, it definitely does what it says it does. It gives you words, and teaches you what they are, hence, vocabulary. it's great."
5,The Best Tear Garden,"Certainly a fine album in it's own right, quite possibly the best of the Tear Garden catalogue. A little more tamed and focused, some of the most beautiful stuff cEvin and Ed have ever made together."
3,DVD is good CD is very bad,"First of all im very upset because the one song i bought this for (I'll Find You) is not even on this CD and its suppose to be the 7th track, somebody really screwed up there. The DVD has all the tracks on it so buy it for that but not the CD side. I guess i will never find the song (I'll find you) on CD because the CD is out of print and everybody wants 50 dollars for the album. there are only 13 CD tracks just to let everyone know"
4,Good student introduction to politics & economic reasoning.,"Ideal as a suplement for undergraduate economics courses, or as a principal text for a course focused on economics and politcal/ethical reasoning. Shows the flexibility of resoning with economics, which is, for better or worse, the basic ""grammar"" of contemporary policy debate. Also shows that the political implications of such reasoning are not always easy to predetermine on a liberal/conservative axis. The analysis of economic efficiency, for example, does not preclude one from examining distributional consequences or questions of fairness"
1,Disrespectful and Crude,"I heard this read at a library for a children's story time for a ""Father's day Presentation"" and it is a horrible story to read to children. It gives the impression that dads and fathers are completely useless, boorish, farting incompetent morons who are dirty and lazy and have no reason to be around except that they are fun to play with and ""mom says we can keep"" them. Not a title I would buy for my kids or anyone else impressionable. We have enough poor images of men in the world without adding more."
5,wonderful fun,"This is a wonderful book--really fun to read aloud, and good for lots of laughs and lots of fun animal imitations--i highly recommend it!"
4,book review,The pictures are fun. Story is cute and easy to relate to for any child who has a dog in the house.
4,Perfect for wide icing stripes and fillings,"I saw this product while looking for a versatile pastry bag. I wanted one to ice cakes and cupcakes but also to stuff cannoli. This bag turned out to be perfect! The tips work wonderfully and create a very pretty presentation on cakes. The bag holds a fairly large amount of icing or filling. (On my first use, I filled the bag half-way with icing and iced an 8 x 5 pound cake.) All pieces are also very easy to clean and dry. While I do wish there were a few more tips included, I do enjoy this product and would highly recommend it!"
4,"good strong bag, good for maybe 10 uses","This is a good sturdy bag that handles thick doughs and icings well with no leaking. It is easy to clean and with the inner plastic coating, you'll not likely have any problems with food soaking into the bag for the first 6-8 uses. If all you're using this bag for is non-dairy frostings, then it would be easy to justify the expense, however if you're using it for egg or cream based foods (choux, custard) then you are limited to maybe 10 uses before you see evidence of food remaining even after a good cleaning. I recommend, overall, using just a gallon freezer bag with a coupler and tip. You already have them on hand likely, they cost mere pennies and perform just as well, without worry of contamination, as they are disposable. From now on I'll stick to the AB rule of no one-task items and just use what I have on hand."
5,GREAT PRICE FOR THIS COMBO,THE TIPS ARE LARGER FOR PIPING BORDERS. RECEIVED EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED. BAG IS CANVAS MATERIAL LINED WITH PLASTIC FOR EASIER CLEANING AND USE. BAG IS BIG ENOUGH FOR ABOUT 9 OUNCES OF FILLING AND 3.5 CUPS.
5,love it!,this was just what I have been looking for to make my deviled eggs. I searched the local stores for tips this large but there was none to be found. Thank you for offering this item.
5,Great Investment,"It was all but completely impossible for me to find an 806 tip sold by itself, be it in a store, or even online. This set was the smallest and most inexpensive I had found.Let me just say it's worth every penny! The tips are both the perfect size for frosting cupcakes and the piping bag that comes with the set is the nicest one I've seen. Love it!"
4,as described and timely,"Item arrived as described in a timely fashion. Worked great for neat and fast deviled eggs. Clean up was easy enough; the were no annoying seems for food to get caked in. there is no screw in collar to hold tip in place, but with a little care that was pretty much a non issue."
5,"Big help, little price","This is a very versatile set, and a must in any kitchen! The larger tips can be used for almost anything from pate'choux, to filling deviled eggs, to dolled up mashed potatoes! The bag is strong but flexible, and can be washed and used over and over. If you do anything creative in your kitchen, you need this."
5,great buy,It is very hard to find large filler tubes like this with the pastry bag. I use this for cannolli and pizzelles and it is perfect. Really a great buy!
4,great pastry bag,I bought this bag to use to fill cannoli and it worked great. Just wash the bag out when done and no waste for the landfill- a great green reusable product- can't wait to try it for twice baked potatoes !!
3,good value but good for very simple projects only,This a cheap buy and good if you want something for piping batter in to a pan or a really simple icing pattern. But its hard to clean and Ive used better and more expensive ones that squeeze and fill more easily.
1,"absolutely the worst thing I have ever ordered, just pure 100% junk","this is an absolute screw-up on behalf of Black and Decker the metal grate gets cocked in sideways from the flimsy holder and all the free space for it to go up and down in as soon as cheese is gently placed against it. it then jams itself up and it will not run until it is opened up and the grate is repositioned it is a joke, the flip top holder that is supposed to hold the grate in place is flimsy it will not hold the grate straight there is way too much slop in it there is no way on here that I can slam this piece of **** the way I would prefer, and get it published . don't buy this piece of **** , beware it is junk. this is my honest unbias opinion from experiencing this hilarious gizmo cause all I can get it to do is to make me laugh at how gullible I must be it would be almost impossible to put the grate in wrong it only fits one way"
2,Very little Linux specific information,"Had it een called ""Unix Command Summary"" I might have given it four stars. For someone new to linux with experience in Unix there will be almost nothing useful in this book."
2,Snore.,"I'm a real Shatner/Nimoy fanboy. Really. Got their autographs at Dragon*Con, copies of all their shows and movies, blah blah blah. It is nice for me to watch them talk,and it's kinda cool to see Mr. Nimoy's home. Otherwise...Boring. I mean really. The promo has all the interesting stuff in the whole interview. What else can I say but ""Aw, Nuts!"""
5,"I am a little late, don't you think?","Well, this is a 2001 product so what's the point in writing a review?Because I love Star Trek, it influenced my life and I admire those characters. And most of all, because I just now discovered this DVD.Being so I just want to say this DVD is excellent in technical quality and I enjoyed every minute of its content. Period."
2,"avoid the ""Shatner"" persona","I'm sorry everybody but Shatner is such a bore. It was kind of interesting to see the old friends remembering thier frailties of youth, but this is just stupid, save your money."
1,Won't work with FS2002,"I purchased this item thinking it would work with FS2002. It won't. My mistake, as it clearly states that it is for FS2000. Just a word to the wise."
5,Anatomy for Beginners,Wow! Terrific! Amazing! Should be required viewing for any student of anatomy--at the college or medical school level. Well done.
5,I watched it on TV before,Wanted to have my own copy so that I can use it for future reference- I can retain it better after watching the DVD
5,Extremely informative,"I've had to go in for surgery & this was very helpful, I was able to understand much better what & where things were going to happen in the OR."
3,Intriguing story with a poor ending,"This Goosebumps book is a good example both of what R.L. Stine does well -- and not so well.Stine has a real talent for setting up weird, unusual and sometime frightening scenarios that lure in readers and keep you guessing. This is certainly true in ""Attack of the Jack-o-Lanterns,"" where a simple night of trick-or-treating grows increasingly scary and bizarre. I read these books with my son (he reads some, I read some) and we were eagerly turning pages to see how it would turn out.But one of Stine's weaknesses in the Goosebumps series is that, having set up these intriguing situations, he sometimes seems not to know how to end them. This may be most true in this particular book, where the ending comes so completely out of left field that it's jarring. It seems like Stine had painted himself into a corner and had to desperately scramble for a way out. We had hoped for some clever conclusion, but this one is just disappointing."
3,Kind of strange.,"I think it should have been more like the jack 'o lantern pops out from behind a house when they try to go home and chant ""more houses, more houses"". To be honest, I wanted it to be more thrilling and less complaining about trick-or-treating forever. So, as you see, I gave it 3-stars."
3,It was O.K.,It wasn't as scary as other Goosebumps books. My sister read it (She's 6) and she didn't have any trouble falling asleep. For some other Goosebumps books she had nightmares.
2,A very boring book.,"This book is boring because there was no real fun ,and the characters didn't act normal. Sepecial Edition Goosebump books are better."
1,Wobbles!,"I was so excited to get this item, based on the reviews. Unfortunately, I had to return it. When I set it on the counter and gave it a test spin it wobbled horribly. It WAS nice and heavy and it looked sturdy. I really wanted to love it but it just didn't happen for me and I haven't been able to convince myself that I need to try a second one to see if it was a fluke."
1,Platform wobbles and mounted off center,"Looking at the glowing reviews, I must have gotten one of the bad ones. The turntable was built like a tank, but the platform was mounted severely off center and it had a horrible wobble. I sent it back to Amazon. There must be a bad batch of them with wobbly platforms that slipped past quality control.The design is fairly simple. The cake stand has a heavy cast iron base. The platform is made of aluminum which is mounted to a steel post that rotates in the base - bare metal to bare metal. There are no ball bearings and it appears to need a good glob of grease type lubricant on the post to help it turn easier.I am going to try the Fat Daddio's turntable rather then risk getting another Ateco stand that wobbles. I do not like the idea of picking up a much heavier cake stand and spending even more, but the Fat Daddio's has gotten fantastic reviews and it is suppose to have smooth ball bearings for easier turning."
5,Wonderful,I got this as a Christmas gift. It is beautiful and functional. Works very well. I would recommend this product.
5,Great for icing cakes,I would definitely recommend this stand for any baker! So helpful for icing pretty cakes! Great size and a great purchase
5,I love this cake stand!!!!!,"I love this cake stand. It is easy to store and nice enough to leave out on the counter top. When I opened it I was disappointed that it didn't lock into place, but once I put it work, I found it is fine that it doesn't. It holds it's place very well and doesn't spin unless I turn it. It turns so smoothly, I have used my friend's wilton turntable which does lock and it turns when it gets pressure unless you lock it and it doesn't turn smooth. Overall I am trilled that I decided to go with this one, and I will have it forever due to the quality that it is. Did I say that I love this cake stand??!!!"
4,Built to Last a Lifetime,"I use this at home and should add that from what I've experienced working as a pastry chef and cake decorator in many commercial bakeries is that this cake turntable is the #1 choice for professional bakers. The heavy ceramic base prevents slipping and the weighty stainless steel top rotates evenly. The axle can get caked with cake over time so it's important to keep it clean. If the wheel gets stuck, it can be oiled with mineral oil. There is no other revolving cake stand on the market that performs quite so well. The cost is worth a product that, if cared for well, will last a lifetime. More frugal shoppers who do not like the price tag might be better of trying a wood lazy Suzan in place of a professional turntable."
5,"Top quality, you'll wonder how you decorated without it.","Every serious cake decorator needs one of these. The cheap little plastic Wilton ones you can get form WalMart are ok, but if you want efficiency, this one is top notch."
5,"Love, love, love it!","I have been selling custom designed cakes for two years now and have 4 plastic turntables. A friend sent me this one and I am never going back. LOVE IT. I can't believe how smooth it turns, it does not wobble and it's sturdy. I can probably put a three tiered cake on it without a problem. It just feels so good. I had already received the dummy attachment from a family member but just hadn't gotten the stand. Now I have everything I need. Love it. Can't say enough about it. Get one."
5,Ateco 612,"I bought this table a few weeks ago because it was on sale and needed to upgrade. I read the reviews and was a little unsure because a lot of people kept saying that it wobbled. I opened mine up and took it for a spin and I'm happy to say it dose not wobble. However the wheel it's self is a little small for decorating 12+inches or above, the base also is a little bit slippery but you can fix that with a little Dutch tape. All in all a good buy."
3,An excellent anthology but not much of a history book,"This book is an excellent pictorial anthology, as it has abundant photos. However, the effect of this on a person interested in the raw foods movement, is to merely whet their appetite for more info on the history of the movement. The text of the book is scant, so it delivers very limited info on the history of the movement.Despite the above, I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the historical roots of the modern day raw food movement."
2,very little content,"This book is a series of biographical sketches of figures in nature-centered countercultural movements of the 19th to early 20th centuries. These sketches are no more informative than Wikipedia entries and the book is mostly photographs anyhow. As another reviewer has also noted, the printing quality of the photos is low. But mostly, the accompanying text contains no analysis or context. The only thing this book is good for is giving modern hippies who want to believe they are part of a long-standing cultural movement a peg to hang their beliefs on.I was interested in this book because I wanted to understand the connection between WWII-era Austria and California that brought Arnold Schwarzenegger here. You won't get any insight into such questions from this book other than the observation that some these German body-culturists traveled to California (but why?)."
5,Beautiful Acclaim on History,"This book is wonderful-it provides the history and background of the early counterculture in Germany. There is wonderful art and even some glossy photos. The people are beautiful, along with the ideas they support. I highly recommend it for the great insight and perspective one can experience just through flipping the pages. I also read this book for the information on acclaimed authors that sprang out of this time and place in history-for instance Hermann Hesse."
2,Dumb,They should have stopped after the first movie! It's the same thing over and over again. The same preditable plot....................boring
2,More watchable than I actually expected but still bad,"It's funny that a review title says ""what were they thinking ?"". Because it's not like any of them were really a good idea in the first place. I mean part 1 was decent and part two was just pretty damn silly. I actually was a little entertained watching this one. Sure it basically is part one all over again with a lot of the same things playing out. It's also poorly directed. It does however keep you entertained through-out and there's like one surprise at the end. Which is about the only thing not predictable about it. It's predictable and a lot like the first film yet part of me thinks it's actually the best one. It's bad but I can't say I didn't have a little fun watching it. I've actually seen worse horror flicks than this. Plus at least we don't get annoying ""what are you waiting for!, what are you waiting for!"" line in this one."
1,Completely dumb,"I can't believe I paid $22 bucks for this ridiculous movie! The first 2 films in this slasher-franchise were entertaining; part 3 (I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer), however, is a complete waste of time and money. When you're done watching the movie you'll just feel like slapping the director and movie studio for putting such a crappy film out and just trying to capitalize/cash-in on the successful franchise (1st 2 movies)."
1,WHY?,"Lets be honest. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER were less than average horror movies. Throw backs to the original killer teenager one after the other format. STORY? Simplistic at best. The selling point? LOVE HEWITT. GELLAR.Quite simply, these movies prove that all you need is a hot popular girl... maybe two... and who cares how good of a story you have to tell.So, along comes I'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Same simplistic plot. Guy with hook knows you know what you did and wants you to know that what you did is gonna get you hooked. Except... theres no LOVE HEWITT. There's no GELLAR. There's not even a MOESHA... so why watch?So, if you want to watch 5 more teens get skewered and you don't care about your precious time being wasted, then go for it.Production value took a hit. Star power took a hit. Script is the same or worse. Movie straight to video for good reason."
1,I'll Always Think This Movie Sucks,"Horrible. Pathetic. Cheap. Amateurish. Dull. Uninteresting.This movie conjures up so many adjectives for sucking. I could not believe what I was looking at. This has to be one of the absolute worst things I have ever watched. The acting is terrible, the story is thread-bare, the lighting is horrendous, and I could not find one single redeeming quality in the entire mess. This looks like some average, everyday person took a camcorder, got their friends together, and said ""hey, let's shoot a movie!"". The sets appear to be places that the ""film makers"" found on the days the businesses were closed and they just snuck in and started filming at any hour of the day that they could get there. Nobody needs to bother with this. Pure junk."
5,Good entertainment,"To me, this was the best of the bunch. The writing was very good, solid acting and some really great suspenseful scenes. Highly recommend this one."
1,"Dang, It took like only 8yrs to make!!!","I think this movie is going to suck. It took them 8 freakin' years to make the third in the trilogy. The first two films have been looooong forgotten, and some of the new audience probably were too young to remember anything about them; And Where's Jennifer? This looks like another low-budget film that's gonna recieve low reviews for certain."
2,GET HOOKED AGAIN,"Aside from the clever twist at the end, this third entry in the I KNOW...series is pretty derivative and not that scary. No one from the previous two movies is around in this one, though the legend of the Fisherman still exists.A prank gone wrong on a Fourth of July leads four teenagers to make a pact of secrecy in telling how their young friend died. Of course, we meet them a year later and someone is sending messages to the crew, saying..I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER...soon each of the teens is picked off and we're left to wonder who the killer is. No real standout performances from the cast of unknowns, but I will admit the identity of the killer is surprising. Probably will be the last in this franchise that's grown too familiar to be interesting."
1,UGH,"Yet another terrible DVD sequel to join ""Hollow Man 2"" and ""Starship Troopers 2"".This madness needs to end before ""Scream 4ever"" or ""Darkness Falls - Again"" sees the light of day."
1,What the....?,"For a start, just to set everyone straight - Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) died at the end of the second one - unless they passed it off as a stupid dream sequence again. It's sooooo stupid to make another sequal, when the first sequel was awfull enough - with Brandy and her huge butt. The first one was good OKAY - so let's leave it alone. And that was only good cos Sarah Michelle Geller was in it and Kevin Williamson had written it."
2,I KNOW WHAT YOU DID TRILOGy,"I thought the first two movies (I know what you did last summer) (I still know what you did last summer) were fairly exciting and fun (at least 3 out of 5 stars even if they were cliche) but the last one (I'll always know what you did last summer) is kind of slow, although it's not altogether terrible, it's just not great.What really turned me off was the setting of the carnival which I've seen dozens of times before, and the whole thing with the prank gone wrong, which I didn't buy.By the time you get around to part three, the urban legend bogeyman isn't doing too much new and this slasher movie is just starting to repeat the others. It could have been worse as a final to the trilogy, but it's just borderline ok for a teen flick, if it comes as part of the collection."
1,I'll always know what you did last summer,HAted this movie!!! I enjoyed the other I know... movies thought I would give this a try and it stunk!!!
3,"Good movies, bad case","The first two movies I thought were good, and in good condition, the third movie had never been opened, and probably because that movie was horrible. the box that hold all three dvds was in awful condition, too the point I considered sending it back, but used items are not all in the same condition, just be aware."
1,0 STARS: Pretty much unwatchable.,"""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer"" was a very poor attempt to wrap up a not-so-good trilogy of movies. This particular movie is very bad mainly because the acting is so pathetic, and the movie comes off incredibly generic, especially since the first two movies did it much better the first two times around and that's not saying much I know.Indeed, this movie is a lot like the first two, but it has terrible actors in it. I caught this on Fearnet not too long ago, and I had a VERY difficult time sitting through this boring garbage. This is a tired script people...give it a rest."
1,"If Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't act in it, the whole movie goes away with her!!","A lot of years ago I heard they would do another ""I Know what u did...."", but they waited 7 years to do it!! Plus, we all connect I Know what you did last summer with Jennifer Love Hewitt....WHERE IS SHE, BY THE WAY? She doesn't even act in this movie, they just chose some random kids from the High School Acting Class... Besides, what is this about, anyway? What happened to Julie James, because you're not gonna tell me that blonde girl is Julie James!!They shouldn't have gone on with the sequel, there's nothing else to do. What is this going to be..New kids who supposedly kill Ben Willis again, and he again comes kill them? Come on! After the two original movies this one is not even closer!!!Maybe, Maybe the only way I could see this movie is if anybody invites me...an maybe not even then."
2,um...,the first one was good i suppose...the 2cd one? it was OK but...IT'S DEADstop trying to make money by making crappy sequels... as soon and miss jennifer love hewit said 'no' you should have counted your loses and gone homei bet this sucks
3,Rain Gear,"I was disappointed in the structure. For the money I thought it would be a little more substantial then just a vinyl jacket. However, it will fit over my winter coat or layered cloths to keep me dry on a rainy day."
3,Basic SOA info available elsewhere,"I bought this book with great anticipation, but was left empty. Much of the material in here can be gleamed from other books (Thomas Erl's which has worked examples) and websites (notably IBM's).For a gentle intro to Services this is good."
3,Milton se dio un gusto,"Todo lo que canta Milton es hermoso. Cualquier melodía, en su voz, es espléndida. Aquí se dió el gusto de elegir un repertorio muy diverso (desde ""Frenesí"", de Alberto Domínguez hasta ""Beat it"" de Michael Jackson), de contratar un gran arreglador y orquestador (Wagner Tiso), de grabar en Londres con la orquesta de Graham Preskett, de ponerse un smoking y dedicarse sólo a cantar. El resultado es un disco de una calidad indiscutible, pero un poco frío, con un Milton no tan suelto al cantar en español o en inglés. Se extrañan sus composiciones y su sonido más ""brasileiro"". Pero ""Bituca"" se quiso dar el gusto de ser Crooner y se lo merece. Lo mejor: la versión de ""Mas que nada"" de Jorge Ben."

2,Unless These Books Bring Back Destinations and Hostel Listings They'll Be Lonely on the Shelves Due to New Better Competitors,"Since the late 90's Lonely Planet have been dwindling down the number of destinations and hostel listings in these guides and replacing that space with more five star hotels, fine dining and other useless information backpackers will never use. In this edition Lonely Planet lists the most expensive Hotel in Australia, Palazzo Versace in their Gold Coast accommodation listings. They are so out of touch with their target market now it is not funny.Buy the Backpackers Ultimate Guide (BUG) Australia instead as it is what Lonely Planet and Lets Go used to be. A comprehensive coverage of all hostels in a destination, not just the one or two that pay to be listed and no weight increasing space taking up useless information that we backpackers do not want to lug around an entire continent.If you can find an old copy from ten years ago buy it otherwise give Lonely Planet a miss!"
3,Outdated prices,"As with most countries LP has the most comprehensive travelguide on Australia, but it is time to update this issue concerning prices. After introduction of the new taxsystem in Australia almost none of the prices mentioned are correct, which is quite irritating..."
5,Australia guidebook,"Excellent book, covers everything the tourist would want to know about Australia. With 1116 pages, however, it is rather bulky to carry on the trip."
1,ramblings... again,"I think it's time that the message come through: Lonely Planet is one of the most outdated sources you can you. Simply because, for hotels and how to get there, you can now just scour the Net for the best deals nad reviews. As for food, I usually just eat wherever place that looks good for me- no picking beforehand. So there you have it; take away all these practical components, and this book becomes quite crappy. The quality of the maps are mediocre; however, try something better, like Fodor's, Rough Guide (very user friendly) or DK Eyewitness (which has ex hotel and restaurant listings but lots of great graphics). [...] Its time for the editors to update its format..."
5,This is a great book to have on hand!,"I have bought this book for several friends! Even if the friends did not need it for their own dating lives, it has a lot of great advice that can be shared with friends. Anyone who is dating or wants to be dating can benefit from this book!"
5,practical biblical advice,practical biblical advice I purchased this book as a resource since I work with teenagersthe book is written in a funny and honest way that causes people to listen up
2,disappointed,"This is a huge coffee table book with some cool pics like one of an exhausted John Lennon with a handful of pills laying on the end table beside him. Unfortunately, these photos are not great. Benson includes blurry shots, and none of the photos show all four Beatles at the same time. The cover shot is the best picture in the whole book. In a word: disappointing."
5,beautiful,"bought it as a gift for my father, and he loved it. great pictures, good price; wonderful choice for the die hard fan."
2,Eh,"A decent first effort, but nothing particularly memorable or noteworthy.The lyrics are more intimate and insightful than a good amount of what's out there now, but that's more of an insult to what's out there now than an accolade to MacLean. Hers is the kind of slow-and-pretty music with little discernible difference from one song to the next, and lacks the passion or originality to keep them interesting. The exception (...sort of) is the haunting track ""Silence,"" for which I give the extra star.Ultimately, it's quite an innocuous little album, but I suppose that'll never hurt anyone."
5,It really does grow on you...,"I reviewed this album last week (6/24/99) and since then, like I said, it has grown on me... I've probably listened to it ten or fifteen times since then, and I'm not getting tired of it. It still doesn't have that much variety, but that doesn't matter. I think I'm starting to become obsessed with Tara's music, so I guess I'll have to buy more...The whole album, as I said, is great, but the best two songs have to be ""Let Her Feel The Rain"" and ""More"". I'm not sure if I think this for musical/lyrical reasons, or if it's because these two songs really encapsulate who I am, at least right now. Based on these two songs, a friend recommended to me Songs, by Leonard Cohen, so if you like those songs, buy it and you won't be disappointed.To borrow from another review I saw in this site (actually, it was for Cohen's ""Songs"", if I'm not mistaken), if this album doesn't touch your soul, you have no soul to be touched."
5,LOVED IT!,"Tara MacLean is so beautiful, and her voice is so soft and sweet, my favourite song was Evidence and Silence. Such a great CD, if you like music from Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Holly Cole, etc. this is the MUST BUY!"
3,"I hate to pan a good recording, but...","Tara MacLean has a bit too much of that ""teen-age angst"" which seems to infect quite a few of the young women who were involved in the Lilith Fair project; namely, Fiona Apple and Paula Cole. (Perhaps it's the opposite of Britney Spears' ""chic-pop"" sound?) ""Silence"" is not a bad recording; but ""Let Her Feel The Rain"" (both versions) have a common thread of gloom and doom shared by ""For You"" and the title track. ""Silence"" could be a good album for a rainy day in Toronto, Ms. MacLean's hometown, but it can also get monotonous after repeated listenings. Her voice is quite captivating, though..."
1,This women has no soul...,"I'm sure she's a nice women, but i could not connect with any of her songs on this album... very bland..her second album is much better by the way.."
5,a hauntingly beautiful voice and lyrics to match!,I bought this CD on a whim and it has become my all time favorite. Even after listening to it for almost two years it is in my top five picks! Her lyrics can be read as poetry; the fact that she adds her voice to them and gives them power with her song is spellbinding. Her voice is similar to Sarah McLachlin's who is another of my favorites; though I think the poetry of Tara's music surpasses Sarah.
5,"Hauntingly beautiful voice, carefully crafted songs","Tara MacLean has created a real work of art in Silence. It is a bit hard to categorize: certainly not Pop, maybe Folk. The songs are easily followed but deserve a listen while reading along from the printed lyrics. The subjects tend toward dispair and darkness but the beautiful voice holds out hope and light. Her use of words to paint a picture is exceptional. After saying how much I love her voice, is it odd to note that the 12th track, the unlisted instrumental, provides a particularly powerful close to a really fine album?"
4,Hmmmm....experts say this is a very good player.,"I checked out Consumer Reports and Home Theater Hi Fi's DVD benchmark. This player gets higher marks than most players and does so at less money. Sure it may have quirks, but the image it displays is very good.Perhaps some other reviewers didn't have it hooked up using the component (not composite) hook-ups?"
3,Not ALL bad!,"Reading the other reviews I decided to write in toshibas defense! The DVD SD-3960 is not all that bad...I mean come on its only 69.99, what do you expect it to do? Make you coffee in the morning? It just does what it says, Progressive Scan!!! I have not expirenced any problems with the player getting hot, or a flickering saturated picture. I switched from the Samsung N-501 Nuon player. And I noticed a huge difference. The Picture is brighter the sound has better range and the progerssive scan worked like i expected it to. The remote however is a POS BUT if your like me you have 50 remotes and one master universal remote to control everything, so no big deal. I hope this helps."
1,Audio Quit After 9 months,"The player was working fine, no frills, but working. Then the audio just stopped. Video still plays fine but no audio. I have had two Toshiba DVD players fail on me now. Time to switch brands I guess..."
5,Great Value!,"Toshiba is a very reliable, good quality mfg. This progressive scan DVD player is PRICED to sell! Compared to the ""no name"" garbage that is on the market, you can't go wrong with this one...Plays everything you throw at it - MP3's , media files burned off the web, JPEG files, scratched DVD's...Great sound quality for CD's...Compact size...100X FF, Zoom, etc.Quiet transport. This is a WINNER! Best yet, [...]"
3,Not Perfect,"This player was a gift for my father in law a couple years ago. One of ours died, and he didn't need it any more so he gave it to us. It works fine except for one annoying feature we've had almost from the start (we've had it about a year). The problem is the disc drawer won't open about 80% of the time. We either have to get finger nails in the top/sides while hitting the eject button, or by pressing/tapping hard on the top right above the drawer. Then half the time after getting it to open, it will close right back up so you have to hold the drawer open while putting in the disc."
1,You get what you pay for,"Given another chance, I would gladly go back and spend the extra $20-30 for a quality DVD player. I quickly began to suspect poor workmanship when I first turned the player on and it told me ""no"" instead of ""on,"" a small issue but a sign of things to come. It struggles to pick up the signal from the remote, often requiring several attempts for any command, and then takes hesitates for several seconds before responding. The information given on the small screen is limited and not terribly helpful. Also there are no arrow buttons on the actual DVD player so if you lose the remote and Your DVD's menu doesn't start on the ""play movie"" option, you're out of luck."
1,the worst DVD player i have seen,This is by far the worst DVD player I have usedTakes at least 10 seconds to open the tray and to load it takes 30 seconds sometimesOf the 20 DVD's I have tried to watch atleast 5-6 had to be played on a different player since this player worked as if I had put in a stone disci was able to watch only 2-3 movies without any skippingVCD's are ruled out although claims are madeDVDs that are good on other players are termed as badIt starts grinding when moving between chaptersi would reject this player outright even if it is offered for 4.99 instead of 49.99Toshiba should stop selling this than wasting the postage money of the clients by sending another useless player
1,worst electronic component I've ever bought.,Bought this in Jan. From about week 2 it started having trouble reading ANY disc... new or old. It gets worse and worse. It's such a piece of junk that I don't even want it repaired! I could replace this unit with a dead cat and have the same functionality. Last Toshiba piece I ever buy.
1,Total Junk,"This DVD player's performance has nothing to do with ""setup"" or using the ""component"" video outs. It basically lasted me 3 months and then stopped reading half the discs I stick in it whether they are new, old, owned or rented. My older Toshiba sd-2109 lasted 3 years and still works better this this sd-3960 does right now after only 3 months. For half the discs I put in it; the door takes forever to open, the motor makes strange sounds, it pauses constantly sometimes starting back up and sometimes not, or it just displays bad disk. For those of you that can't understand the bad reviews, count your blessings. You lucked out in a manufacturing process that is lacking quality control. Just because yours works doesn't mean 100% of them will. This player has an unually high failure and defect rate. It was a complete waste of $50."
1,Cheap Plastic,"I used to really like Toshiba products, but not so much anymore. This DVD player has a lot of problems. I bought it off of Amazon and have had it for two weeks. With component cables hooked up, and sending in both 480i and 480p this player will flash the screen black when there are moments in movies with bright flashes, such as lightning or flash bulbs. Doesn't sound like it would happen often but it has happened in every movie I have watched on this player. Also, it will hang between chapters in about 1/2 the movies I've watched. I would really recommend purchasing another brand, spend a little more. I'm sending this one back to Toshiba and will purchase from another company. It's not worth the price."
2,get a different one,"I didnt buy this, but rather won it at a company picnic. It is nice that it does mp3 and jpgs, but almost all players do now adays. what it lacks is, a good dvd player though. I seriously watched ""the great outdoors"", an classic comedy with not too much action, and several time the picture became pixelated because the player couldnt handle it. Half way through ""mulholand drive"" I took it out and put it in my old panasonic player (at least 3 years old) where it played perfectly. beyond that, it is slow at opening the door (not too big of a deal), has a terrible midget remote, and a display that doesnt show time elapsed or anything else. you can get a much better player for the money."
1,It broke 1 month after my warranty ran out :-(,"After grinding slowly to a halt, my Toshiba SD-3960SU DVD Player is no longer working. For a while it would display the DVD menu and work if I pressed play, pause and then play again. But now it makes a lot of read/write noise and finally just stops all together with a frame frozen. It might work again, but this its definitely grinding to a slow and noisey death."
1,"Blurry, washed-out picture.","There's really not much else to say -- I bought this to replace a non-progressive DVD player, and at first I thought I was seeing things... the colors were washed out and unsaturated, and there was a grainy texture to everything. I tried several DVD's, and they're all the same. I also tried going from component video to S-video, but that didn't fix the problem. Maybe it's just the one I got, but I'm just going to get something else."
1,sound died,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this, because just as others before me, the player lost sound after less than a year's use. It worked well before that. At least there are subtitles!"
1,Bought as a gift and was delivered broken...,"I was very disappointed to learn that I'd purchased this as a gift and when the person received it, it only worked for 2 days then quit.I was however, very pleased that Toshiba responded to the broken item without question an replaced it (and upgraded it) free of charge. I would recommend doing business with Toshiba because their customer service is great. But unfortunately I cannot recommend this DVD player."
3,"Good product, I suppose...","My vet is a good vet, and he gave this to me to use to clean my dog's ears last time I took her in for an ear problem. I have been using it as directed in my dogs ear for the last few days. So far, there has been little improvement. But at least it smells nice, doesn't seem to cause pain, and it might also be preventing the ear problem from getting worse.I have ordered some Zymox Otic (with hydrocortizone). It is one of only two over-the-counter products I can find to treat chronic ear problems that everyone seems to agree WORKS. Look it up if your dog has chronic ear problems. Currently has 49 positive reviews on amazon dot com, and zero negatives."
5,Awesome new series,"I had been hearing good things about this show, and they were all true. I was so happy to have bought it and will be getting the other volumes as soon as I can. They delivery was prompt as well with no damage to the item."
1,Not Absolute truth!,"I watched this video for the first time with my children and was thankful that I did. This video does not teach that God created the world in 6 days. Mr. Visher insinuates that God probably used the Big Bang or some type of evolution. Our family is a huge fan of the Veggie Tale videos so I had high expectations of these videos, but unfortunatly I will not be allowing my children to watch any of them. Our children hear enough lies and compromise about the Bible from the secular world, they do not need to hear it from a place that is claiming to tell them the truth about it."
2,"Expected so much more- good intentions, poor execution","I expected so much more from these DVDs with the great reviews, so I purchased the first four a while back. I mean, who doesn't want to help their children and themselves learn more about the Bible? Unfortunately, my son and I were dissapointed. He didn't want to watch much of it. I didn't either. I felt so overstimulated with all the different characters, songs, discussions and arguments going all over the place. It was hard to focus on the real information and storyline. I went back on my own to finish the DVD and it didn't get better.In fact, we watched this one around age 3 and that was our result, now at 4 it's the same. Didn't get any better for me either, so I'm selling my other three DVDs new in the package and I hope someone comes out with some great DVDs for kids with the same intentions."
2,Way over their heads,"I purchased this dvd for $5 shipped and thought it would be a great deal, but I was wrong. I admire the creator Phil Vischer and thought the content would be really sound. The content was fine, but the delivery was not geared towards young children. Having witty puppets intermingled with explanations about the Septuagint is not going to keep the attention of the average child. My five-year-old and three-year-old were quickly lost and never regained much interest. I gave it two stars because I learned some things, but I'm guessing that I'm not their target audience."
1,This pen was a fake,"The alleged Mont Blanc pen that I bought was a total fake. I bought it for my boyfriend's law school graduation, and I received it and everything seemed OK. He took it to the Mont Blanc store to get it engraved, and they identified the pen as a fake. They said it was an excellent fake, but fake nonetheless. Don't be fooled by this vendor."
1,Item not authentic,I purchased the Mont Blanc. Paid immediately. Shipping was fast. Customer service was good. I asked some detailed questions about the authenticity of the pen after purchase. Customer service just told me to trust them. When I received the pen it was a fake or replica and was not authentic. I was disappointed. I immediately returned the pen at my expense. I was promptly refunded my original purchase price.
3,"Looks great, terrible quality","Mont Blanc make great looking ""status"" pens and Stawalker is not an exception. 5*s for appearance and more fun that the dull-as-dishwater- everyone-has-one Black Meiserstuck.That said, Mont Blancs are the Range Rover of the pen world. Look great but terrible reliability for a $400+ writing instrumentFineliner refills last barely 2 weeks before they are blunted out, so if you are planning to use this is a regular pen, expect to buy new refills regularly at $8 a pop. The rubber casing on this pen begins to flake off immediately you begin using it. After about 2yrs I returned it to MB for a new barrel which cost 100$.So, great as a special occassion pen, but not really a workhorse.M"
2,Billboard's opera,"This publication serves well as a coffee-table book but less well as an encyclopedia. Its organization requires a knowledge of opera history and its tiny-print, spotty index is not easy for the information seeker to use. The few errors I have found make me distrustful of the content as a whole. The subjective content, such as recommended recordings, goes beyond the purpose of an encyclopedia."
3,"A Little Slow in Places, but Great Pictures!",The book can give a good idea of the life experiences of a big game hunter in Africa but is slow going in places. The book does have a wide variety of excellent photos that depict Edward Foa's various trophies etc. A good airplane book...you might only finish it if you have nothing else to distract you. Not the best of theCapstick series.
4,Refreshing alternative to English African hunters,"I especially liked Foa's matter-of-fact descriptions of his hunting methods, guns, camp equipment, etc from the 1890's. His approach seems refreshingly straightforward compared to many of the macho English big game hunters of the 20th century (Foa was French). Foa certainly had some mighty adventures at a time when Central African hunting was not a tourist's game, and just as black powder was giving way to smokeless. I couldn't put the book down. I would like to find other of Foa's books translated to English."
5,Lost art? Hardly.,"Kathleen Meyer would be the one lady I would not want to go in the woods without! Her insight to the obvious will keep you rolling until your sides ache! As for cetain kinds of devilish little buggers getting loose into the water supply, Kathleen takes a no-nonsence approach as to how to poop and not pollute! She has a chapter for women only and solutions to the ""flat rock problems"" most women have to deal with in the woods as well. I strongly recommend this book, especially for scouting mom's!"
3,Read the sample pages,"This is one of those books that will either amuse you or offend you, so I suggest you take advantage of Amazon's sample page views before buying.For myself, I was gently amused but, after twenty pages or so, found my eyelids closing and sleep looming threateningly over my head. Why?... well, frankly, it's just not very interesting!If you've nothing important on your agenda, by all means take a trip through Kathleen Meyer's world of bodily functions. Otherwise, go for a brisk walk - you'll learn more."
3,The title tell it all---a one topic book of limited use,"I had hoped this book would give lots of tips concerning backpacking and camping. It does not. It only covers one topic, as described in the title. A phamphlet could tell me everything I need to know about this. I will not waste my time reading this entire book."
2,Book review,This book is OK but does not contain any new or different information. It was not what I expected.
5,Don't let title offend you - a useful book,"Despite the title, this volume should be essential reading to all hikers and backbackers who have a digestive system. Practical and ecological, the humor makes the reading easy and not offensive."
5,It's a body function get over it!,"A well written book about a subject that people normally don't think about till they are out in the middle of nowhere and it's too late to find a restroom that is miles away. The title may be offensive to some but, the books provides excellent information"
2,Not the best book,"There was plenty of s*** humor, but I didn't learn anything new. Mostly just skimmed through it and put it aside."
5,PC Magazine Windows Vista Solutions,It's A good book and had A lot of good Vista tips ans solutions.
4,Good System for the Money,"I am satisfied that I got what I paid for with this system. I wish it had more written documentation and actual installation CD's for the operating system and other software, but I expected corners to be cut somewhere to get such a good price. The product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. It now appears that this particular system has been discontinued, but there are other similar offers from TigerDirect. I was particularly pleased with the emphasis on the fact that this system was built in the USA with American labor."
4,Lovers quarrel x 4,"I felt this book was very well written. I love the detailed court proceedings, and detailed forensic information that tied Michelle and Brandon to the killing of Devon. Michelle and Keary made extremely stupid choices to listen to Devon instead of making their lives a little more normal, but I guess that is what makes murderers do what they do. I have been a true crime reader for a long time, and the only difference in this story is the fact that the girls were either lesbian or bisexual. The jealousy, and the reason for anger and murder are the same as always.John Kearney, in my opinion did a great job with this book. I did not put the book down until I was finished, and that is what makes a great writer great for me. I will continue reading his true crime books."
1,BORING!,I couldn't even finish reading this one! Was it absolutely necessary to repeat the details of the crime over and over and over again???? Very poorly written!
3,"Nice Law, Lousy Weapons","Mr. Reed seems to know a great deal about law, but very little about weapons. At one point the bad guy picks off a bird at 500 yards, while it is flying, with a rifle. There are also implausible shotguns, revolvers, and magic bullets. Flaws like this dilute the rest of a fairly compelling book."
2,Needs editing,"I thought the book was mildly entertaining in parts, but overall needed a lot of editing in terms of cutting out unnecessary sections. The story dragged for a large portion of the middle part when Leonie and Roger are trapped in France for years... reading it felt like years too. I think the author tried to cover too much historical time and in the process managed to wring the life out of the story. I wish I had cut bait after reading the first few chapters instead of reading to the end only to feel like I had wasted my time."
3,Good Book,"This was a good story but I kept getting stuck in all of the historical background details. Don't get me wrong, there is no question as to the quality of this book. Very well done! But at times, the story of the 2 main characters got lost in the ""setting/background info"". I would definitely recommend you read this book, just be aware that there is significant history intertwined as well."
1,It HAD so much potential...,"Truly, this book had so much potential. Leonie was a good heroine, Roger had a good basis even though lacking a bit of edge/flavor, the plot was different than the same ole-same ole, and even the French Revoluation is a great backdrop in which to be set...but it just couldn't get pulled together. The relationship between our lovers was annoyingly overwrought with misunderstandings played out in their internal dialog; All I wanted to do was yell at the characters through my kindle screen saying, ""Be an ADULT already and just SAY THESE THINGS so you can work out your problems and we can be done with this!"". The Revolutionary details and dialog became mud-like to trudge through, and wasn't ever lightened through witty dialog or even good love scenes. Every love scene was followed by more internal diaglog of insecurities and uncertainties and it was all just laborious. Yeah, this is free, but truly save yourselves the frustration and hours of your life from this read."
1,OMG!,"This book was killing me. It was so boring I had to keep clicking to find something good about it,which I did not. This book was All about them being trapped in france for years. I wanted to pull my hair out. Thank God This Was FREE."
5,"""Guitar Man"" could be Teddy's middle name....","this record holds so much soul, so much powerful and honest energy that you just wanna cry out loud. teddy is a master of the guitar-- like the low-down-on-the-floor way he makes his guitar growl on ""Walk Away Cryin'"". Or how it cries on ""I Ain't Waitin' No More""....these songs feel as though they were always written, like they were always out there but never before recorded. teddy is a like a bullet from a gun... he means what he says. bo ramsey produced this gold mine of music and also lays down some of his signature slide guitar tracks on ""'59 Cadillac"". this is a superb collection of blues/rock/roots/county -- do not miss out."
4,An album worth discovering,"I was at a club earlier this year to check out some headliner (don't even remember them!) for whom Teddy Morgan was opening. I don't think I made it past his set. An amazing blend of rock, country, and that Texas twang thang. While I agree that the CD can be a bit all over the place, I don't know that with a band like this it's a detriment. Morgan is very accomplished with what he does and it shows. Having a scattered album only showcases his talent. If you're up for discovering something new, but somewhat familiar at the same time, you may have a winner here. Pick it up!!"
3,the point&figure method of anticipating stock prices.,"The content itself is good and useful in making some profits in stock or currency trading. However, there is one major problem about false signal (either buy or sell signal), about which the author never mentions and never gives any suggestions to solve this obstacle. In general, the book is helpful !"
5,The maximum on George Gershwin in minimum time!,"If you are a student needing to do a research paper on Gershwin, present a report in class, or just a fan who wants to know more about the composer of masterpieces such as ""American in Paris,"" ""Porgy and Bess,"" and, of course, ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" then George Gershwin Remembered is an excellent resource for you.Presented occasionally on the A&E network, ""George Gershwin Remembered"" takes on George's life from the start of his days as Jacob Gershwitz to his tragic death at an early age.Interviews with numerous Gershwin authorities are presented along with stirring remembrances of his work. A simple ""must-have"" for any Gershwin lover."
5,George Gershwin Remembered,Anyone who loves George Gershwin and his memorable masterpieces will be enthralled with this walk through his life. I highly recommend it.
5,"Funny, Facts-of-Life Friend","Having read this book before our first child was born, as well as a lot of other books, I found that as each new parenting situation came up, as each amazing baby behavior surfaced, parts from all the other books came to my mind half the time -- and parts from this book the other half. How this one book taught me so much can be attributed to the humor, and me-and-you-buddy approach the author takes. She's like a sister or a close friend laying out the territory for you and making it funny, to boot. This is your best bet."
1,"I bought it, I tried it & now I'm forgetting it","Ok so I decided to purchase & try this cream before investing a little more money on other products. Now I just wish I had gone ahead and spent the extra money on one of the peels I was initially going to go with & I will now. This Alpha cream is nothing but a moisturiser, for me at least. I saw NO difference, changes, smoothness, firmness, Nothing by using this cream. It works for some, I guess but did nothing for me. I guess all I can say is try at your own risk, you may safe money now but will spend more later......its up to you. Live & learn."
2,Not that strong,Not that good i used another product that was 5% from the health food store that was better. This had no sting at all. Moved on to 35% from another company....still questioning these kind of face products and their value.
2,Ouch!,"I got a horrible reaction to this cream. My face got terribly scarred and I am still recovering from it. I have used these products before,but for some reason this time I did not get a peel only painful blemishes a burning rash and large bright red and brown dried scabs.Just a very bad reaction!"
3,A-H makes a less expensive version,"This stuff works, but Alpha Hydrox's Enhanced AHA Creme works just as well (despite being a slightly lower percentage of AHA), contains more (2 oz vs 1.6 oz) and costs several dollars less. I've used them both and find the lower percentage a better bargain."
5,The real deal,"With regular use of this 12% alpha hydroxy acid, you will have smoother, silkier skin in no time. There are so many skin products out there that are horrendously expensive but not nearly effective as this. ""Souffle"" perfectly describes the lightness of this cream. It just melts into your skin. You can wear this as a day or night cream.I used Alpha Hydrox skin products for a long time. But, the big box store I went to stopped carrying the brand. I was delighted to find it again!"
3,Alpha Hydrox works but too oily,"It works but gives me break outs every single day, after using it for almost 2 months."
5,It works!,"I'm 55, Irish, freckled, wrinkled and have a few dark age/sun damage spots on my face. Everything makes me break out, but not this stuff. Every other night, I use Neutrogena Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment before applying the AlphaHydrox Souffle. Maybe that helps too. The wrinkles around my mouth are visibly reduced as is one particularly annoying age spot on my cheek. I love this stuff. I've only used it for a month. I'm nearly out, so I'm ordering more because I don't want to be without it."
2,Tough on skin,This product really irritated my skin. I wasn't able to use it long enough to find out if it worked.
5,Nice product.,I love this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and doesn't feel greasy--especially under my makeup. All of the Alpha Hydrox products are great.
5,So far so good,"so far, really great product. My skin feels smoother, finer and my dark spots seem to be a bit lighter. I did get a TUBE instead of the jar that is displayed. I was a bit annoyed with that but I guess it's new packaging and I got the same ounces I paid for. My only issue with this is that the smell is not so great. It smells like medicine/plastic. I know that sounds gross but it kinda does. If you can stand the subtle smell, go for it."
2,Way too harsh on my skin,"For some reason this line doesn't work for me. I tried the cleanser two years ago and it made my skin break out. After reading the reviews for the moisturizer I decided to give the brand another shot. Bad idea. I looked like I had a sunburn, in addition to breaking out. On the plus side, it did make my skin softer but other moisturizers can do that too. I'm sure this product works well for others but it's not for everyone. Proceed with caution."
3,Noticeable change in skin,"This product doesn't pull off any miracles. The first couple of weeks it even broke me out worse. After that though, I could see an improvement in my skin. It seemed softer, smoother, and generally nicer. No significant change in the one sun spot I have. Not a bad little product for the price. The two reasons I gave it 3 stars were due to the vast number of white heads I had the first two initial weeks of use. (That was kind of crazy.) And secondly, when I told my dermatologist I was using it, the look of sheer horror and the chastising lecture I received were enough to discourage me from continuing to use it. She said a bath tub of water with a quarter cup of bleach in it would have been less damaging to my skin than this. I can't really smack down the product though since I don't have her medical training behind me. I can only pass on the review."
1,Not for me,"I used this product for just two days. My face became more sensitive and red, especially under the eyes. The skin on my cheek also became dry and itchy. Don't buy it!!!"
1,why does the two-pack cost more than twice as much?,"I've used the single jar of this cream, and it's fantastic. I was intrigued to see that amazon is offering a two-pack for a price that is almost triple what two single jars would cost. Doesn't seem like a very good deal."
2,Alpha Hydrox AHA souffle 12%,"Received two units of the Alpha Hydrox AHA souffle 12% Delivery time was longer then expected, and one jar had been previously opened. Thru that one away. Diffinitely not satisfied."
5,We love Paprika's Lullabye,"My 3 1/2 year old son adores this CD. We listen to it in the car almost daily, and now at night, he has begun to request that I sing him ""Paprika's Lullabye."" Since I have heard it so many times, I am happy to oblige. It's a sweet lullabye full of delicious images for little ones, even including a moment worthy of Edith Piaf in there!"
4,Goodnight Blue CD,My daughter loves the story and music and has listened to this CD until I know every word! She doesn't listen to it to go to sleep though as it keeps her awake because she stays awake to keep listening... so I recommend the CD but not for helping with settling to sleep.
5,Absolutely Perfect!,"Our family has loved this CD for over 4 years now. Yes we did forget about it for about a year or so, then my kids re-discovered it at the library (ours is lost) and we've been listening to it for weeks! My 6 year old is on a mission to find her lost CD so she can listen to it every night again. It is so soothing, fun, and well, just perfect! Now my son wants his own copy too so I guess we need to buy another copy!! Great job Steve and Blue!"
5,Getting rick,Product arrived on time and as described. Bought if as a give so I can't say much more than that.
4,Mozart's String Quintets,"Mozart's string quintets, along with the E flat trio & the quartets dedicated to Haydn, are among his greatest chamber works. The Talich play with fine ensemble & technical skill. Their sound is never over blended, glossy, or over projected. They never play to the balconey. Their playing is truly an intimate dialogue. That said, they are at times, slightly too reticent in some passages. Over all though, these are excellant performances of wonderful music. These quintets, much like the ""Haydn Quartets"", emcompass a large range of emotions and moods.The clarinet quintet is also very well performed. This set contains great music that is well performed, well recorded, and at a most reasonable price. Why hesitate?"
2,bad quality,all of the CD's(total of 3) had scratcy noise behind music...otherwisewould have great listening..
3,"Great music, bad engineering","AS many have observed, the music on this CD is fabulous; Mozart's best. But the engineering stinks. In addition to the scratchiness of CD#2, the sound engineers seem to have just put the volume on high for the base track throughout the whole set of CDs. As a result, you can hear every tiny note the base plays, but the melody is stuck way in the background and often can hardly be heard. I was very disappointed and after contacting Amazon, they took the set back for a refund.PackJac"
3,Knowing the subjects,"I probably would not have read this book, until I found out few years after that I had been dating the adult Male victims wife. The ex of the killer named Sandy. We did not date for a long period of time. However after reading this book and with my inside knowledge of the family and victims. I believe it may be that Sandy put her ex-boyfriend up to this, possibly trying to release herself from an unhappy marriage. You will have to make your own conclusions. I think the writer was spot-on when pointing a finger in Sandy's direction."
3,Blame the Victim?,"This book was very interesting and competent when describing the process in which the chemical substance that caused the deaths was tracked down. However, two parts of this book disturbed me greatly. The first was that the author kept casting unfounded suspicions on the surviving wife. I really felt disgusted by this in some portions of this work. The second is the author sometimes veers into satanism. One gets the feeling that this theme was originally more prominent in this work and an editor reigned it in. Still, someone should inform the author that humanism does not equate with satanism."
4,family,Well whatever freak would right that she set it up is sick. That is my aunt. It is a terrible sick thing that happened and the book almost has all of the facts correct.
1,"Great history of the Internet, poor coverage of subject","This book is a poor rehash of existing documentation. The installation chapters provide little or no additional insight, and closely resemble the available product documentation.It does, however, provide in the first chapter a great history of the internet, and a primer on TCP/IP.For people wanting to learn how Checkpoint works, there is no overview or description of what all the moving parts are, and there really isn't any sstep-by-step help that isn't already accessable via product documentation.In short, if you need a book to give you insight, assistance or instruction on setting up a Check Point Firewall like I did (above and beyond the documents that accompany FW-1 or your firewall appliance) this isn't the book to get."
3,Not a hit,"The rug may eventually get played with...but it's not dynamic enough to hold my 2 year old's attention. It seems somewhat durable however, so I think I will be able to move it outside and it'll hold up well."
3,"Actually, this single is quite funny","This is an alright single, but I wish a live version of one of the songs off of ""Touch"" were on here. The radio version of ""Steaming"" is clearer and much better than the album version, whereas the dance mix of the song is definately 80's era (that makes sense since ""Touch"" was released in 1988). The Peter Gabriel cover of ""Solsbury Hill"" is cute, especially with Sarah's laugh at the beginning, but it's also funny to listen to."
1,Not what it looks like,This item looks much bigger online than it actually is. The item is quite small and it took me by surprise when I received a large box and then opened it only to find a tiny container of Mink oil. I understand that Mink oil might be expensive and in short supply but this is really tiny.
5,Pleased with everything about it.,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday, and was a little worried about how she would like it as she is not very technically inclined. She loves it and has completely mastered the various features quite easily. The size is pefect for sticking in her purse or pocket, and the provided necklace is a much more convenient way to wear it than some of the lanyards that you have to buy in order to wear other MP3 players. 512MB holds way more music than I expected and I am glad that I didn't buy the 1G as I am sure she never would have used all that memory. The rechargable battery is a big plus too It recharges off your computer through the USB, she simply plugs it into our PC everynight before bed and it is all ready to go the next day, way better than my old unit that requires new 'AAA's every month. She is so happy with it that I am buying another for myself."
5,Better than an ipod!,"This is a fabulous little product. I have an ipod which I use as my home stereo but, the Samsung is what I use for my portable music player as it is durable. Whether I am jogging or in the car, I grab my Samsung. Sleek, durable and <$100, what more could you ask for!"
2,Good looking but so cheaply made,"Fixture looks nice but required a new ballast after only using it for one week. Had to replace bulbs because of the yellow tint they gave off. Light still not sufficient with the cool white bulbs, as fixture will only accommodate 32 wt bulbs. Would be better considering the size of the fixture if a 40 wt bulb could be used also. Kitchen looks dim. The supports for the bulbs are hard to work with as the material used is very poor quality. Wound up spending a lot of extra money on items that I had to replace and tips for the handyman needed to replace them for me. Disappointing."
4,In orbit again,"These space food sticks are just not the same, the shape being differant is the big disappointment. No longer can you go eating it like licorice, you have to deal with wrappers. Other than that the retro afternoon with peanutty taste is the same."
1,Pass on the peanut butter ones....,"I had the peanut butter ones when I was young and these are not as I remember them. I was very disappointed. I bought them for nostalgia but my wife and son tried them for the first time and really disliked them. I would recommend trying them in smaller quantities. Check their web site, they have them at limited places in the US and they also have a variety pack."
2,Easy to save till there is a disaster.,"Good for emergency rations, because I won't touch another if I am not STARVING. I still carry two with me hunting, camping and in my bug out bag just in case I do become starving. The taste is comparable to 4 parts powdered plaster mixed together with 1 part peanut oil, 1/2 part peanut butter (the cheap smooth stuff) and rolled down a parking ramp."
2,Not what I remember in the 70s,"I guess when you try to recapture your youth, you usually fail. I remember eating these in the 70s and was just crazy about them. I bought these and there was nothing wrong with them, they just did not taste like what I remember them tasting like. I ended up giving the entire box to my brother, maybe he likes them as much as we did when we were kids."
2,Peanut butter is not the flavor you want,"I love the currently available chocolate flavor, but the peanut butter flavor is not very good in my opinion. I recall liking both as a child, but I can't say if this is because my sense of taste has changed radically or the flavor has changed."
4,"Miriam and her brother, Moses","This book is great for early elementary school age children. I was hoping for a book describing Miriam as an adult and her important role as the Israelites left Egypt. Although I was disappointed that it did not describe her later in her life, it is a great book showing her relationship with her little brother Moses. Illustrations are great!"
1,It doesn't have any of the music from the film,"I was disappointed, because I didn't hear any of this stuff on the film. There was some good mood music and I wanted to hear more of it."
2,Trauma? Where?,"Not much trauma here. A lot of gratuitous t&a;, including a lengthly shower scene in a girls' locker room. The nice thing about that is these are real women, not the new-millennium, fake-boob, Barbie doll variety. It's the 70s, Italy, La Dolce Vita! Woohoo!The plot? Woman die, guy investigates, nudity ensues.There is a cute twist at the climax and a wholly unbelievable ending. The twist would have gotten it 3 stars, but the ending? You gotta be kidding. Worth renting. 2 stars."
3,Its just okay a bit slow at the start.,For Collectors.Give it a chance... it does pick up and I ended up joying it. Just a bit slow at the start.
3,Santa Chocolate Candy Mold,Mold was of good quality with allot of detail. Would have given this a 5 star rating but each santa face was so big and took so much chocolate to fill. Too much for the kids I was giving them to.
1,Poor,"Installs incorrectly, requires helping program find files it can't locate without active intervention. Poor interface system; user has to come all the way out of the program instead of going to main menu. No booklet or other documentation. I haven't been able to wade through it all, but the instruction program itself seems poorly laid out. Avoid."
1,Hangs in Mac OSX,"Does not run properly in OSX. Tried on several fully up to date OSX 10.3.7 G3 and even high end G4 systems. The Basic Instruction vingettes hang (program stops responding) requiring a ""force quit"". The hangs are consistent and reproduceable indicating the software and not our various computers are at fault. When not hung much of the sound/animation is choppy.. and it's running natively in OSX! This package needs some work."
2,Not heavy enough,"My daughter loves dancing, so we thought she would like these. Unfortunately, they're not very stable. The first time we put books between them, one fell off her bookshelf, and the leg broke off. We now have those black metal bookends to hold the books up and put these over them. Although they are cute, I do not recommend these bookends."
4,A book my son will have forever,My son is 13 and loves this book. He refers to it all the time. He learned a lot from it.
1,This product bears no resemblance to the picture,"Item packaging in no way resembles picture on Amazon.com. Expected 1950's flashback product, instead got 21st century Chinese knockoff. As this was what my girlfriend had ""most wanted"" for Christmas, all in all it was completely disappointing.May 8, 2012 update - I note that the product image now matches the product that I ordered back in 2008. However, as it did not match at the time, I'm leaving my above comment unchanged."
1,This product rusts!,Do not buy this product! I washed the metal decorating tips in dish detergent and a bit of bleach. I let them air-dry on a rack in my kitchen. The tips rusted!!!
