3,Not Great,"I am using the book for my multivariable calculus class. Five examples -- vaguely related to the exercises -- are not enough to learn the material. This book is good as a reference, once you have already learned the material. However, attempting to independently learn topics is very difficult. While the solutions to the examples are thorough, they do not explain the reasoning in choosing a particular approach. It leaves the reader thinking... ""I know how to do the example, but I surely don't know how to approach this exercise."" More thorough explanations of technique rather than pure examples would be very helpful."
1,Who is this book written for?,"This book does not seem to be written for students! This book seems like an ""Oh-Ho, look at how smart I am, let me see if I can confuse Mathematics Doctorates everywhere! Students, ha! I will impress all of my colleagues with this little gem!"" Granted that reading math is not the easiest thing to do, but this is not an amiable book for students, I would be more inclined to be taught with a Schaum's Outline than this! This seems to be a trend with mathematics and science text books though. Only written to impress others in the field with little care for someone trying to actually LEARN the material. Thank you for your time."
2,"good price, but ....should tell me the condition of the book more than the word ""Acceptable""","I thought i wrote the review already, but amazon wants me to review it again.....hmmm, it's a good price for this book, but the seller should tell me the book is molded on the website....."
2,Can we get a book that actually helps the students??,I've been a student at the University of Delaware. I have taken the engineering calc course 3 times - third time i finally passed - every class used the same book!I am now taking calc 242 which is the next calc course - it is VERY difficult. Most of my friends i have asked did not pass this course on their first try.This book STINKS - it does NOT have enough examples to make it understandable to eningeering students
4,A great math book to own,"The book has a great structure. It connects well to bring a person to advance his math skill into college-level. The structure is great and easy to follow. The proofs are clear. Different from most of math textbooks where examples are easier than exercises, this book provides the same level of difficulty on both. Although the author starts skipping proofs in multivariable calculus, he explains the reason. My recommendation is that he tie-up the structure in multivariable calculus portion. It definitely will be a 5-stars book."
1,Awful,"As another reviewer said, the learning curve for those coming out of pre-calculus is too steep. The sample problems presented in this book are not explained clearly, and the problem sets are useless when it comes to creating an exam."
4,Comprehensive look at Calculus,"So far, only four chapters into the text, Calculus: Early Transcendentals appears to be a well-rounded introduction to Calculus. The text is arranged in a familiar manner where information can be readily found. The only bad thing I have to say about it thus far is that it doesn't always explain steps in its example problems in as much detail as I would sometimes like."
1,Badly Written and Organized and Wrong in places,"This is one of the worst examples of a math textbook I have seen in a long while. The material is badly organized with the student skipping from topic to topic without rhyme or reason. Stewarts writing is horrible. It is a mix of everyday language and advanced math terms (some of which he seems to have found in a dictionary since he doesn't use them correctly) that is almost impossible to understand without reference to another book. The graphics are small, badly placed, and horribly labelled all of which makes using them very difficult. In several section the proofs and theories he gives are wrong yet the error will be repeated several times without it being caught then in the next chapter the right one will be used without comment."
5,Calculus at its finest,"This is by far the best math text I have ever used. I find the examples adaquate, theorems well explained and homework problems challenging however possible. The main reason I love this book is that it does its job - it teaches you calculus in an easy to understand manner, while letting you see the power of calculus through many well done applications. I finished both Calc I & II with A+ grades solely from learning straight out of the text (I'm not a fan of 8:30 class). Just make sure you pick up the solution manuals along with the text."
4,Very good mystery...,"In Paradise, Ohio, Josie Toadfern is a laundromat owner and the local stain removal expert. This time, instead of a bake competition piling up bodies, it is a psychic fair.Josie has rented out the second apartment over her laundromat to a couple that owns the New Age bookshop and Tarot Card reading room in town. The Paradise Psychic Fair is coming up and soothsayers seem to be everywhere. One even tells Josie that danger approaches.Major tension fills the air as the more conservative town residents go head-to-head with the New Age groups. Then, you guessed it, Josie literally stumbles across a body.**** If you enjoyed ""Death By Deep Dish Pie"" then you will love this one as well. This mystery is a bit easier to figure out than Sharon Short's last, but readers will still find it challenging. Very good reading here. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
3,Good pacing but too sketchy,"The plot line wasn't bad and the pace was very good but the writing was disappointing. The repartee wasn't remotely scintillating and the remainder of the language had little or no spark. There wasn't enough character development though I must admit I believe that was because the author had to keep within a word limit on the writing. Josie, the main character, has interesting and colorful friends and the situation she has with her significant other is intriguing. I imagine the second book in the series will be better. If it isn't I won't buy the third but this author deserves two chances."
3,So-So,"I enjoyed the first two books of this series, but this one just didn't do it for me.The book takes place in a small town in Ohio, so I'm not sure why the book felt like it was set in the south. I recently read a book with a setting of Greensboro, NC and I felt like these characters were an extension of the ones in that book. It definitely didn't set the book in Ohio, in my mind.I also found the story itself to be very confusing because of the number of characters involved. Between the locals and the psychics, there were just too many secondary characters to keep track of.I hope the next installment is better."
2,Live,"It might be OK if it wasn't Live, to much talking going on. Very disappointed. I ordered this thinking, I would have some nice music to listen to, but no , to much talking and clapping, If I wanted to Hear a sermon, I tune in to TV or on the Internet. Thank-you."
4,"it's not bad, but i'll buy it","if your a mellow-type of a person like someone i truly know, then here's something you might want to own, the 80's lovesong collection"
5,Good wooden handle shovel,"This is a good wooden handle shovel. It is well built and is decently priced.I really don't understand, though, why someone would buy a wooden handle shovel then give a reduced rating because the shovel has a wooden handle. Maybe they thought the company would be really generous and send them a shovel with a fiberglass handle even though they were advertising a shovel with a wooden handle. LOL"
5,Love at first sight,"You laugh, cry and laugh some more. Love the music and no foul language so you don't have to worry about who is listening."
5,Stunning Streisand,First of allâ€¦it's Barbra! Ya gotta love her and that talent. Secondly...two of her movie hits in one package? It's Streisand heaven!
1,Did not receive complete order,"The product was advertised as being a package of both Funny Girl and Funny Lady. I received it and gave it as a gift. To my embarrassment, the box contained two copies of Funny Girl. Very disappointed."
4,Funny Girl/Funny Lady,Both of these movies were entertaining. I liked Funny Lady better than Funny Girl. I loved the signature songs in both movies.
4,"Well Produced, Well Photographed","There are many books of this type currently on the market, I think this one is as good as any of them. As a plant identifier it is excellent, with a strong emphasis on flowering plants, always a plus, but the book goes much further than just being a ""photo album"". The descriptions of plants are clear and concise, including the origin of the plant, its flowering period and average size. Also included is the spination pattern of the plant and a small synopsis on cultivation for each one, (I am not sure I always agree with the author on minimum temperatures, but so many other factors come into determining this). There are articles on obtaining seed, sowing the seed, taking cuttings and grafting. This is another book that has decided to use symbols to denote flowering, amount of sun required, watering etc. All in all the books is very good and I recommend it to the cactus grower."
5,image changing,with so many unrealistic images it is empowering to finally find someone with a realistic voice telling us all to appreciate the beauty that we each already have...
4,Nice little calendar,"This is a nice little calendar that gives the reader a good idea about the spirit of Zen. It is especially good for those who don't know much about Zen, as it uses many quotes from many non-Zen sources as well as Zen masters. I also recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold which is filled with hundreds of inspirational and profound thoughts."
3,A disappointment,"I was dismayed and disappointed with the author's use of expletives and low-level language expressed by the main characters of the book. The plot, the story line, the accurate use of genealogical research plans and actions were superb. I would like to share this book with my daughters and grand children but, instead, it ended up in the waste basket. I was appalled with the poor quality of the given text--any spellcheck and grammer program would have caught many of the errors. This is not acceptable in grade school! The author's note revealed a higher level of aspiration to inspire curiosity about family history and heritage in his readers, than was displayed in the story as exhibited by the language used throughout the book. I was uncomfortable reading the book, but kept on for genealogical research interest."
5,Didn't want to put it down!,"I got caught up in this story from page one. It is very enjoyable for historians, geneology buffs, or just plain lovers of fiction. I hope to see more works from Mr. Brown very soon."
5,basic N. American archaeological source,"this is a great basic sourcebook for non-professionals or undergraduate students in archaeology (like myself). Rather than being organized chronologically or regionally as with many sources in the field, as an encyclopedia this book is alphabetically organized and is great for finding quick summaries of various topics, like sites, cultural complexes,and famous archaeologists, amongst many others.The downside is that the book is pretty dated at this point, being compiled in 1998. Many more data may (or may not) have since been collected on the various topics. Nevertheless, I still recommend this book, although NOT for the current listed price of $345 dollars (buy it used)"
1,"Redundant, Repetitive, and Rediculous","This book of 400 ideas and ways to help organize your child was not at all what I expected. While I consider myself an organized parent, I am always looking for new ideas and methods of keeping myself and family on track. This book did not contain 400 ideas, at least not 400 DIFFERENT ideas. In the listing of her 400 ideas, the author mentions ""color-coding your family"" a dozen times.... No need to break it down into ""color code each child's outerwear, to keep separate"" and ""color code files to keep each child's schoolwork, notes, etc."" It's all the same. It is a book you can leaf through in under an hour, and probably while waiting at the checkout of the grocery store. Nothing earth-shatteringly helpful."
5,The Best of Marty Robbins,"Previous review by another reviewer indicated ""A Train and a Man"" was a cut that should not have been part of this great album. I purchased ""Best of Marty Robbins"" to obtain ""A Train and a Man"", having sought it out since seeing the movie wherein he sang ""A Train and a Man"". Great song by a great singer who will not soon be forgotten!"
4,Not quite 'The Best of'..............,"Marty Robbins' best work was undoubtedly on the Columbia label and these 10 are from his short sojourn with MCA. The best song on here is 'Life' which is Marty's 'My Way' and is a Marty Robbins original of the highest standard. Personally, I like 'A Man And A Train' (from the Lee Marvin movie) which Marty really belts out and showed how Robbins could cross the tracks so effortlessly from Country to any other genre. All in all, not a bad album but there are many better ones by one of the greatest talents ever to grace Country music. Other tracks include 'Love Me', 'Crawling On My Knees', 'Shotgun Rider' and a tipping of Mary's stetson to 'The Father of Country Music' Jimmie Rodgers with 'Two Gun Daddy.' As a side note, I believe ther is still some unreleased material from his post MCA days on Columbia which hasn't seen the light of day yet.Why?!"
3,BEWARE!,"Don't know for sure, but the fact that the ""product description"" above has no description of any kind makes me VERY suspicious. I got burned once by a Canadian outfit which offers 3 thru 7 in 2 boxed sets that are made up of all the censored/edited episodes. Of course, they don't reveal this. I watched half of the first episode, saw immediately that it was not the original version so I demanded my money back and they very reluctantly did so. I suspect that this is the work of this same company--apparently they've just re-packaged these ""sanitized"" versions, trying to trick us. Again. How sleazy.No, I'll continue to wait for the announced (years ago) MGM sets. I've tried every which way to contact MGM but they refuse to respond. NETFLIX has them listed--but not for normal rental! Hello?! When asked about this, their rep was evasive. What in the HELL is going on? This mystery just goes on and on. There must be a reason, but what could that be? AL"
4,good box set,"great box set good storys ,this box set is the later series and is hard to find so shop around and dont pay over the odds for it ,its not worth it even if its one of the better series .brian"
2,how to start a home-based interior design business 4th,"Before I purchased this book I read Juan's review, but being the""Doubting Thomas"" kind of person I am, I bought it anyway. I should have listened to Juan. His review is completely accurate."
5,glad you got it right,alfie is an excavator not a backhoe. i know this because construction vehicles are my hobby and trucks and trains with faces
5,My son's favorite toy,"We actually inherited this along with a set of other tracks and trains from a family whose boys had outgrown Thomas. We'd been saving them up for our son's second birthday, but gave him this one early after he fell in love with construction sites in general and backhoes in particular. For months, our son and ""Little Backhoe"" have been inseparable--he loves moving the scooping arm up and down and spinning the car around on its wheel base. He doesn't seem to be bothered that the scoop is flat across the top, and it is magnetized, which he has not noticed but I thought was fun. It's also very durable, as are the other Thomas trains--this one has been carried everywhere, thrown, stepped on, and it barely has a chip in the paint."
3,Super cute but won't scoop,"One of the reasons we asked for this toy was that it combined my boy's love for the Thomas and Friends trains with his love for construction vehicles. Although Alfie is as well-constructed as other T&F; vehicles, the scooper itself is covered over with a plastic plate. So, the scooper doesn't scoop. BOO. Annoyed both me and the boy.We did later discover that the scooper is magnetized which is fun."
3,Thomas and Friends's ever expanding characters,"My son (just turned three) is obsessed with Thomas and Friends so I got Alfie and Jack for his birthday. He loves it and plays with it for hours at a time so it's money well spent I suppose.The toy itself is built pretty solid and resembles show character pretty closely. It's build pretty solidly from wood. It's digging arm is jointed at the base and at the scoop is you can mimic digging motion. It's a very simple, sturdy toy."
3,trains,"Our star ratings reflect the questions asked, which did not pertain as well as I thought other questions could've been. Otherwise it is great. It was new in a package and arrived as described."
3,"oh poop, won't scoop","The first thing my son wanted to do was scoop dirt with 'ol Alfie, but alas, you can't, its a solid scooper!After picking around at it later, I discovered that it has a magnet inside, probably to be used with other overpriced Thomas the Train accessories."
2,Very difficult to assemble - poor quality,"Very poor quality, my husband had to re-drill all the holes. The little black cross holders break and do not work, once again my husband came through and made a secure holder for the gords. The only reason this got even one start is the birds do like the gords - but then again they did not have to put it together."
1,Low quality image,"The sound was great, the music enjoyable, but we have a 42-inch television and the image quality was so bad it looked rather like an orange blur with a couple brown sticks, very pixelated. I really wanted to like it and tried to get past the quality, but it was sooo bad! Unless your television is very small, I'd go with another item. Hopefully Amazon will let me return it even though it's been opened!"
4,Love it,I love this DVD. The music is a little annoying after a little while. But I swear that I feel warmer when the fireplace is on.
1,"Basic, poorly done, and disappointing","Dislikes:1) The image of the fire is too close up so you cannot see the top of the flames. This doesn't sound like a big deal but it is because the optical illusion of turning your TV into a fireplace is spoiled by this. It doesn't look real or convincing.2) The video is on a loop so the fire never changes -- it doesn't flare up and then die down -- it just roars away like a gas log set turned up high. I was hoping for something more like a traditional real fire that would have more variation.3) The flames are too bright for the camera causing a kind of burnout on screen, which is hard on the eyes. It's a pity it wasn't better filmed.4) The fireplace itself is boring and not cosy.I do not recommend this product."
4,Christmas,This DVD is great. I didn't have a fire place but I wanted the look of a fireplace and sound of it for the holidays. I love the sounds and the music. You can play only the crackling fire sound or with music. Its great for the hoildays if you don't have a fire place. I really loved it and my friends loved it and purchased their own.
5,instant fireplace,I am so impressed with The Happy Holiday Hearth. It makes the room feel so cozy and warm. We had some friends over last weekend and I had our new fireplace going. They were so impressed that they ordered one for them self and they are giving them for Christmas presents this year.So don't be afraid to order. You won't be disappointed.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RJCM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,Wonderful but doesn't work!,"This wonderful dvd is great on my little computer but is unreadable on our expensive dvd/vcr player in our living room! Of course, that is where we had hoped to be able to enjoy it! Any ideas?"
3,It's nice,It is exactly what it claims to be. I wish there were different fires to look at instead of the exact same one throughout the DVD. It was relaxing and fun to watch/ listen to.
5,Cheerful,"The sound is very soothing and realistic. Guests loved it! Adding the Christmas carols was lovely also--the mix was unobtrusive. It looped seamlessly so the ""fire"" lasted hours--no logs or restarting needed."
3,Nice music,I like this DVD....the only thing I didnt like is that I cannot fast forward any of it...perhaps its the CD I purchased...the music is the same sound throughout......
4,Very Pleased,"This DVD completely fills my 42"" screen with a video of a fire that has been recently been started but is now well burning. Since the wood never burns down this is obviously a loop, but I've stared at it for a long time and can't spot it. I'm also totally satisfied with the picture quality; this is an abstract subject, and blue ray quality simply isn't required. The fire sounds are subtle and pleasant. I'm particular about music, and guessing that I wouldn't like what is on the disk I have no intention of even sampling it.I do have one complaint. Instead of seeing the typical split logs of an established fire, what you primarily see are smallish round branches stacked in a tepee fashion, more like a campfire. It's the type of wood you might use to get a fire started. However, the fire is still completely realistic, and I'm sticking with 5 stars."
4,Pretty good for a fake fire!,"The music is average, but the fire scenery is quite realistic, even down to the crackling noises. Now all I need is heat...;)"
5,Great DVD of a fireplace,"Based on previous reviews, I purchased The Happy Holiday Hearth DVD and it was great. The music and singing is great!!! Plus the fire is very realistic and I recommend this DVD. One of the best things about the DVD is that there are 3 options to choose: fire; fire + music and fire + music + fire crackling. This was worth every penny."
2,Nice fire/music OK,After watching this dvd twice I had to switch to just the crackling fire. The fire is really very nice but not so the music. It is all the same generic choir and the songs tend to all sound alike. Just some instrumental music thrown in between would be nice. I now play the dvd of the fire and my own Christmas music. For the price it's a good deal.
3,Not bad,"As fireplace videos go, this one is not bad. Better than some much more expensive ones. The editors let you watch the fire for a good long relaxing time, but you don't get the whole life of the fire experience of watching it die down to embers."
1,Really?! A fake fire?,"I live in California - in an apartment with no fireplace. And - I'm originally from Colorado - so I'm used to a white christmas, and a fire blazing throughout winter. So I thought it'd be great to buy a dvd of a crackling fire to make it seem more like the holidays.This dvd, however, was a huge disappointment... so much so that I immediately checked the return policy (which caused me more disappointment since you can't return it once it's opened). The ""fire"" seems like it's on fast forward... burning at such an incredible rate that I think if you actually watch it for any length of time you would have a seizure! It is also very obviously computer generated. With today's technology how is it that a fire can look this fake? Maybe if you turn your head to the side & squint your eyes it'll look real. Or maybe I'm just being picky since I've actually seen a fire in real life ; )I think I'll give it away as a white elephant gift & buy myself a better one!"
1,Low Voltage,"I have been unable to get more then 3.10 volts out of this battery right after charging. Checking my 3 other rechargables, votages after charging are between 4.25 and 4.37 volts. Even thought this is a 3 volt battery at just 3.10 volts my camera will not turn on. An Olympus E10."
4,very good,"Always is a pleasure see and hear old songs... Essencially, this dvd is a great show, good sound and good video, although some classic songs, as ""working in a coal mine"", were absent. It is recomendable to remember old times"
4,Almost GREAT!,"OK, several(or many) other reviewers nix this one, but for a DEVO fan, there ain't much out there these days. I was real happy to get something on a DVD to show my post-pubescent rap-hop infected de-evolutionized sons what REAL music is all about. I would have liked to have the Saturday Night Live gig(s), especially the one with the plastic RonRaygun hairdoos and the treadmills. I forget the name of the tune.But I bought two for the shear fun of seeing DEVO. And I too say, BOOO Hendix holdbackers, that ""experience"" was as much a tribute as you will find anywhere, and the world needs more appreciation and TOLERENCE. D - E - V - O"
1,Sucks.,I'm a hardcore Devo fan and I think they're geniuses. I've read about some of the amazing stage theatrics they've performed and was excited about this dvd. Unfortunately this dvd sucks. Instead of being footage from when they were new and experimental in the 70s or at their peak in the 80s the show is from a 1996 Lollapalooza show. Filmed in broad daylight a very middleaged Devo perform for a crowd of people wearing Metallica t-shirts possibly waiting for Metallica to come on. The crowd seens bored and although Devo put on a better show as middle aged men than other bands do in their prime they are clearly phoning in their performance. The dvd ends with Mark Mothersborough telling the camera that he was dissapointed with the show and looks annoyed when asked if he plans on touring again.Why not release a concert dvd of the Beginning was the End or of their other performance art? Who has the rights to those shows?
5,No Special Effects Reveals How Good Their Music and Musicianship Really Are,"I loved their indoor concert (Northrup Auditorium) in the early '80's, which of course, had all the visual, lighting, etc effects. Same for their videos (""Devo: The Complete Truth About De-evolution""). However, I think this DVD is great precisely because there are no special effects, which reveals that they are truly excellent musicians. In this 1996 Lollapalooza daytime concert they had no stage candy to rely upon. It was just them and their music in the bright afternoon sun. And, in my opinion, they all upped their musicianship since the earlier, 1980 live DVD (""Devo: Live 1980""), especially the guitar and percussion work."
5,LIVE,"Devo Live is the fourth home video release by new wave band Devo, and their second DVD. Devo Live contains an entire performance from their 1996 reunion tour with Lollapalooza, filmed at Irvine Meadows, California. It was released in 2003.The film details an entire live performance from Devo's 1996 reunion tour with Lollapalooza, opening for Metallica. The band performs a stripped down set consisting of songs from their first four albums. The band is in strong form and very energetic. However, the film itself has been criticised by fans for being poorly edited with rapid-fire cuts. Another criticism has been levelled at Rhino Records for their delays in producing the DVD and erronious packagingLolla ThemeWhip ItGirl U Want(I Can't Get No) SatisfactionUncontrollable UrgeBlockheadMongoloidJocko HomoSmart Patrol / Mr. DNAGut Feeling (Slap Your Mammy)Gates of SteelCome Back Jonee"
4,It's good to be Devo,"Low priced, well recorded, what more could you ask for? If you're a fan, this is a MUST.Just for the crazed version of ""Smart patrol/Mr DNA,"" should everyone be made to watch this once. DEVO pogos like it's the late seventies, before domes, treadmills and syncro-screens were a part of the act. This is DEVO stripped to an electric essence, with a sweaty midday sun bearing down on them. And they rock as if they are out to win over a crowd of newbies. That they were playing for a crowd that was more likely there to see Metallica doesn't seem to matter one whit, and there are more than a few faithful in the crowd ready to shout back ""WE ARE DEVO!""If this sounds like a good way to spend under 15 bills and get a solid (almost) hour of DEVO's best, you can't go wrong here."
5,All-Time Favorites,"I bought Mr. Swirsky's new book ""Every Pitcher Tells A Story"" and was so taken by its originality that I bought his first one ""Baseball Letters"". They are quite different and it's hard to tell which one I enjoyed more. I was glad he didn't write to the same players--every letter was a new 'experience'.Great reads."
4,Sweet story with likable characters,"The story kept me engrossed from page one. There weren't any obstacles other than the unspoken secret from her past. The couple came together without any hinderences and floated beyond her secret when it was exposed. The obstacle that came at the end of the story was unexpected and unneccessary, yet the book still had a charming ending.I thoroughly enjoyed it and will go on to read more from Jillian Hart."
4,EXCELLENT,I thought it to be the best of thr Embrace the Darkness series although I kbow there are many who will disagree with me.Brooke Laralee is quite a number and it's too bad she's not in any other films. Here she plays a kind of super vampire who can go out in the sun and is extraordinarily powerful
1,Not good at all,"I think this one is pretty bad compared to Embrace The Darkness 2. Some new actors who do not look very experienced and all the scenes, except the first one, are ordinary and boring. Not an inresting plot neither. I believe Image/Playboy movies are becoming very commercial now. They used to be heaps better a couple of years ago. All their latest releases have been quite disappointing."
5,Top 1 movie of all time? or better?,"I would like to start this review off by saying that SBSA is possibly the greatest cinematic creation of all time. To anyone with a negative comment about this movie, I just don't understand where the criticism is coming from. The special effects in this movie are absolutely outstanding, the plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat, and the acting is top tier. I currently own a copy, and could not be happier. DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE! Order yourself a copy of this piece of cinematic gold and you will find yourself one happy camper. For only $12 this is an absolute steal! Now I know what you're all thinking, this guy is nuts how could ANY movie be that good, well do yourself a favor and put those concerns aside I give my own personal guarantee that you will NOT be disappointed (guarantee not valid). Srsly, top 1 movie of all time...if not better. How can you NOT love spring break? AND SHARKS!! AND ATTACKS!!Signed,IpiteadafooldatdonluvdisMooVee"
1,CBS TV MOVIES on dvd,"this movie was broadcast on CBS tv. I had to watch it, because I love TERRIBLE MOVIES. no real gore, no nudity, very safe to watch but I have to give credit to CBS for actually trying to bring back BAD movies!--the SCI-FI channel is doing it and doing it BAD but BAD can be fun. SBSA has all requirements(blonds, chicks in skimpy wear, no acting, no plot and no point). CBS programming is showing various BUG movies and I have seen them too. check your CBS listings periodically and you may find some PREMIERES? coming up. why is this on dvd?---I have no idea but isn't the cover cool. makes you want to throwdown 10 bucks -- just remember what your getting. ---- also, two other worthless movies that probably will come out too are VAMPIRE BATS and LOCUSTS(both starring LUCY LAWLESS) also CBS movies!! ps, this might be a good double flick with HAMMERHEAD-a true classic to come(read my review on that one too)."
2,DON'T GIVE ME THIS BREAK,"Made for TV movies can be fun, and if they're done with a proper amount of sophistication, worth viewing. This CBS TV movie is not one of those however. The sharks are hardly seen and when they are, it's not with any great amount of technical finesse. As expected, most of the college students act like pre-schoolers and unfortunately most of them aren't good actors. Shannon Lucio and Riley Smith stand out, but Justin Baldoni has little to offer but some nice pecs. With the tons of shark attack movies available, why couldn't this one try a little something different. And yes, I'll forgive the talented Kathy Baker and Bryan Brown for being the main adults in the movie. Exposure is always good and so is the paycheck."
5,GREAT FUN,"A fast moviing, blue sky movie with great looking people & beautiful beach and open ocean photography. Great fun."
5,Great Movie!,"It's a great movie if you are into horror movies, Its kind of Half Horror and Half Party Time you could say. But this great movie for the family and for college kids."
4,Southern Fried,"This may be the only Bill Anderson album still in circulation that includes my favorite Anderson tune, ""Southern Fried"". I would have bought it just for that one tune."
2,Not really important anymore,"At one time this was the only Bill Anderson CD that had any of his hits original recordings. It also contains some of his singles from when he was on Southern Tracks in the early to mid 1980's. The duet with Roy Acuff is a remake. Considering the Varese and Oh Boy! reissues, this set has been rendered obsolete. But for some reason I have a feeling after all of those sets are out of print, this one will still be around."
4,I love the instant commuter!,This book is very interesting.Did you know it takes you back in time? Blizzard Disaster is a long book.I love long books.I like spellbinding books.In fact I couldn't even put Blizzard Disaster down!
3,This isn't worth 5 stars..,"If you liked Disgaea.. Then don't buy this.. If you didn't like Disgaea.. Then don't buy this.. If you haven't played Disgaea.. Buy Disgaea.. If your rich and liked Disgaea.. then you should buy it..Simply put.. Disgaea is better in ever way.. Better graphics, better story, better gameplay, better replay value..If you have Disgaea there is no reason to degrade yourself by buying Disgaea Lite.."
1,"Not a great rpg, dont waste your money","This game isnt that good. The battle is slow, and i just didnt like it Disagea looks much better get that or another rpg. Don't waste your money on this game."
4,tactics is good,"I'm really surprised no one has written a review on this yet.I'll keep this short and sweet. Tactics games are hard to come by. Good ones are even harden to find. I personally think think game oozes with character. I've been playing it frantically for days now. Read official game reveiws to find out more on this one but I say: If you loved Disgaea: Hour of Darkness (all 8 of us by what sales says) you'll love this one. Same universe... same makers... same quirky dark humor. I say ""Get it"".... all 8 of you"
1,Wow - how did this get ANY good reviews?,"Did we not all watch the same horrible movie? The ""acting"" was indescribably bad and got worse as the story progressed.I understand that some people want to watch different, non-cookie-cutter movies, but that doesn't mean any crappy over-acted indie film is considered automatically good.One star for a unique story - kudos to the writer. Other than that -This was painful to watch. These actors really need to take some classes and improve their ""skill."""
3,okay but disappointingly few pictures of patterns,"The amazon.com review accurately describes the contents of this book, but I was disappointed to find relatively few color photographs of linoleum patterns. Someone will write/produce a wonderful book with many color photos of linoleum, but this is not it."
3,Good but disappointing,"I love this show. I was hrilled to hear they hav a box set. I was disappointed, though, by the episodes they chose. Don't get me wrong, there's some good stuff here, but you'd think they'dve chosen some of their best stuff and I don't know who chose these but this is not their best stuff. Good, but by no means among their best. How 'bout 'Space Mutany', 'Leech Woman', 'Parts: The Clonus Horror', and 'Time Chasers? Honestly, who chose these episodes? Did they even bother to poll their fans? I wouldn't recommend this OR tell anyone to save their money. It was so-so."
5,Pure Comedy,"MST3K is a kind of comedy that goes over well with people who know obscure underground culture like it was the current MTV pop-culture. I find it hilarious and stimulating.As for the episodes on this box, they are all classic depictions of what this show was all about. If you've seen the show, you're a fan, unless you did not get it. If not, that's too bad I must say. The show really is brilliant.The episodes here are mainly hosted by Mike with only one Joel episode. The bots are super funny as always and the short about the summer farm trip is down right hysterical.You owe it to yourself to check this out. Even if you've never seen the show, I am sure you have sat through a movie in your own home and just made fun of it through the whole thing. They just take the most self-entertaining concept and cleverly package it for all to enjoy. So enjoy."
5,A treat to have in your DVD library,"There are many great reviews extolling this 4-DVD set's virtues, so I will only add one or two points. First, this is a great introduction to the MST3K world for those who have never experienced the wonderful wit, hilarity, and mock acerbity of the MST3K crew. Second, the movies are really funny and can be watched over and over again without growing tired of them. And finally, Bloodlust, with Robert ""Mr. Brady"" Reed is just absolutely, ridiculously entertaining. I recommend this DVD collection to sci-fi, comedy, and general movie fans alike."
1,You Gotta Be Kidding Me....,"I have got to agree with Jerika (Why did he get 4 not helpful votes?) 10.00+ per episode is way overpriced. I predict this will be re-released someday in a lower priced set or the off the air sellers will continue to have a field day selling the non Rhino complete sets (seasons 0-10) for $90.00. I guess its good that its out so you could rent it through Netflix, but collectors unless pretty well off, will probably pass at this price point. Hey I love the show, 5 stars for material, but 1 star for not being a complete season and for twice the price of the going rate for a complete season TV show on DVD now."
3,Take me to Uranus!!!,"I bought this mainly out of nostalgia for Skydivers. I watched MST3K on sporadic occasions when it was on Comedy Central, but started watching more after moving to Japan. Japanese TV leaves a lot to be desired. I enjoyed the rantings during Skydivers and Bloodlust, but I found myself rooting for the extremely slow moving monster in The Creeping Terror, and sleeping through Catalina Capers. It was cool that they added the original uncut movies to the collection as well.Is it me, or is it a requirement to add at least one crappy movie or TV episode to 'collection' DVDs?"
1,Six Months and Still Waiting,"Have fun waiting to order this DVD. I ordered this back in January of 2007, and still have not received this DVD."
2,Not good enough for cable access?,This show's attempt at humor is mostly in very bad taste ( less than Berlesk). For me taking bad movies and doing sound over ridicule is justnot quite right in the head?
5,More than expected,"A wonderful collection of one of my favorite weekend shows, this compilation gives me the best of both worlds. One side has the show episode with the crews commentary, and the other is the original uncut movie!The packaging is sleek and unique, and the transfer quality is high."
4,The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection Volume One,"This is the first ever DVD box set released of the greatest show of all time...Mystery Science Theater 3000! This is essential to any ""MSTie"" because it is the first ever box set of this fantastic show. This set contains four episodes, all from the Comedy Central-era of the show. Three of them feature Mike Nelson as host. One features Joel Robinson as the host. This set also has a cool feature...the opposite side of the MST3K episode has the Non-MST3K version of the film! Now you, too, can riff away all day at these horrible movies! I would recommend this to any ""MSTie."" It's great fun."
4,"MST Box set.. Great, but could be better...","This is the first boxset collection Rhino has released of Mystery Science Theater 3000, containing the Mike-hosted episodes Skydivers, Bloodlust, and The Creeping Terror. Joel, the first host of the show, only shows up on the Catalina Caper Disc.While these shows aren't quite the classics that volume 2 contains, there are still some wonderful moments here. The Little Richard song in Catalina Caper is a hilarious string of barbs and wisecracks that is, to me, the highlight of that episode. Skydivers is one of the few Roger Corman flicks that's actually watchable - with the mst3k gang helping. I've only made it through the Red Zone Cuba episode once, and I can actually sit through this one. The Creeping Terror is enjoyable just for watching the sheer lack of terror the movie inspires. About the weakest episode here was Bloodlust. Seeing a member of the Brady Bunch cast in that tight of a shirt is just about too much to bear...."
5,Absolutely hilarious,"This is a great set with a wide variety of film genres getting the MST3K treatment. Bloodlust is a gruesome remake of the Most Dangerous Game, Catalina Caper is a Tommy Kirk beach romp with some intentional ""comedy"", The Creeping Terror is possibly the worst and lowest budget monster-on-the-loose picture ever made, and The Skydivers is a Coleman Francis (doesn't that say it all?) ""drama"" involving some skydivers, a love-triangle gone awry and lots of cups of coffee from the same guy who brought us Beast of Yucca Flats. A great selection for both the long-term MST3K fan or someone just wanting to check out the show for the first time. Catalina Caper is worth it alone, as this comes from the legendarily hilarious second season of the show; when you hear Tom Servo singing ""Creepy Girl"" you'll know why MST3K is possibly the funniest show ever to be on television."
5,Great reading for the AA Step minded person,Excellent reading for those that have an already grasp of the Steps. Light hearted easy reading with many good things to revisit with a 180 degree twist.
2,Bleh.,"The concept and title really tickled my sense of humor and curiosity. I figured an AA book in the style of the Screwtape Letters would be a lot of fun. Unfortunately the book is pretty monotonous and I gave up halfway through. Pick up ""Drop The Rock"" instead."
1,Safety Concern,This toy contains a magnet. This is a huge safety concern on a children's toy. Very surprised Amazon did not mention this in the product description. Will be returning this ASAP.
5,Good Quality,"This is the same engine you would buy at Toys 'R Us or Target, etc. Fits great on the wooden track set we have and is holding up to both a 4 year old's and 1 year old's playtime. I was a little worried about his digger coming off, but it hasn't been a problem."
4,Good Thomas Toy,If you depress the drivers cab the front digger blade lifts slightly. There is a weaker magnet in the digger blade which can couple loosely to other thomas toys or the various magnetic cargo pieces.
3,Okay,"Was expecting the product to be larger than what it is. I know this is a popular product but as long as the young man who's getting this gift is happy, than it'll be fine."
5,Gone But Not Forgotten,"This is a great album of Eddie's country hits, but it doesn't begin to cover the man's amazing volume of great work. However, this cd is a good way to get started. His Top 40 hits are included here, along with his own version of The Wanderer, which in my opinion is just as good as Dion's. Eddie Rabbitt will definitely be missed by both country and pop fans. Another major talent gone too soon. Thanks for all the beautiful music, Eddie!"
5,Eddie is the best,I love this cowboy from NJ who left the world far to soon. You wouldn't know Eddie Rabbitt was from Texas or Oklahoma listening to him sing.
5,Love it,I have been using this brand of hair color for a few years now and I love the conditioner that comes with it and the color is exactly what I wanted.
5,Beautiful breaclet!,This is the most beautiful bracelet. The piece is awesome. The sentiment is so true. I love this bracelet and decided to keep it even though I'd bought it as a gift. The workmanship is superb. The bracelet arrived 2 days after I placed my order in a well packaged box; the bracelet was in a white box with a gold ribbon around it.
5,magnetic healing,"I was buying it for a music friend, she has pain whenever she conduct music or teaching a lesson. But I used it before, I wore it at night to slepp when my wrist had a lot of pain due to my computer work, it gave me a big relief. I believe it's the magnetic effect it brought the circulation back and got rid of the pain."
3,"Big, Comprehensive and confusing","Quite good value for money at 786 pages but not well laid out and lacking important details.For instance, I couldn't figure out whether I should configure my (small) network for static IP, DHCP or APIPA. So I picked APIPA but there are no clear instructions on how to configure it for both server and client computers.Obviously - 786 pages are insufficient to fully cover networking! - the most important topic. Look for something better - with clear instructions for setting up the major flavors of networks."
2,"dumb, pointless","If there was a prozac for books, this book would need a dose of it. Dumb, pointless plot. Dumb, pointless characters. A substandard effort from Pohl, who is one of my favorite authors."
5,natural mica collection iron ceiling light fixture,"Great for the money. The mica is natural, but is multiple pieces formed together in what looks like a resin. It looks pretty much in person as it does on line. I was looking for a more amber color mica, this is more like parchment color. It was easy to install and looks great up. I am happy with this purchase and this line of lighting. I also bought the flush mount. I placed them in the upper hallways on my second floor. They give off great light. I am using the energy efficient light bulbs 3 x 60 watts in this semi flush mount and 3 x 40 watts int he flush mount."
3,Abrupt Ending,"I LOVE Julie Garwood - but this book left so many questions unanswered. The characters are wonderful and the dialogue between them sweet and sensual, but it needed a few more chapters to wrap it up. What happened to the evil uncle? The little brother? This is not typical for JG."
1,uphappy,"When I ordered - it was suggested that to order in 3 would be more cost effective, however, one of the items (Gentle Warrior) was sent to me in MP3 which I do not know what that is and cannot listen to it in my car or anything else for that fact. So I spent money on something I cannot use!!!"
2,Not one of Julie Garwood's best,"I listened to this book and have to say I did not care for the performance by Anne Flosnik. I also found the story was slow and the characters unappealing. I think if the author had told the story and let us figure out Elizabeth was teasing instead of explaining to us over and over again that she was teasing her husband, it would have read better. There was no suspense in the story line, it was figured out midway thru and no story developed around the murders of her family."
3,Seemed Incomplete,"It wasn't her best I'll certainly admit but don't feel this book was deserving of one or two stars as far as I'm concerned. I did laugh even wept a bit. It kept me entertained hence the three star rating. The most major thing I can point out is that the ending was abrupt and unresolved. I kept thinking maybe I didn't get the complete ebook, still don't know if I did there's no way of checking without buying the hard copy of the book. Both characters were speaking to each other and then bing bam boom it was over. I wanted to know what specific punishment was doled. I did get it free so I can't complain too much. Enjoy"
3,Bad ending,"Good Garwood story, but the ending had no closure. It felt like it stopped in the middle of a chapter. This was one of my least favorite of hers."
3,Deliciously typical...,"Yeah...well...even though this was basically your typical tedious attract and conquer story between two strong willed individuals, it was still a delicious and entertaining romp. An Alpha Male, Lord Geoffrey, aka: The Hawk - - kewl......(ummmm, and may I just say... ""YUM"")... and beautiful, blond, Lady Elizabeth - - both struggling to learn of one another and remain sane which is a constant and continual test of limits and a battle of wills. YeeHaw!! Let the games commence!Unfortunately this JG story didn't hold the usual humorous situations we've grown to love and come to expect. A sweet romance novel with little hoopla and a tiny mystery to unravel."
3,Plain...,"This is a very simple story with a predictable plot. Unlike the rest of Julie Garwood's historical romance novels, it simply cannot capture my interest. And I must say, I'm a true Garwood fan.An ordinary romance story..."
3,"Aye, I got tired of the dialogue!!","I liked the characters and the story well enough, but at times I laughed just from the words used. I have liked all of her other books that I have read far more than this one."
2,Not her best book,"I've read all of Julie Garwoods books and have loved most of them. This book however seemed to DRAGGGGG on. I skipped many parts of the book because it got so boring. This book is nothing compared to Julie Garwoods other novels like Saving Grace, The Prize, The Gift, The Wedding, etc etc. I wouldve given this book one star, however Julie Garwood is one of my favorite authors, so I decided two stars would be acceptable."
2,TOO MUCH SEX,I usually love the Garwood books but lately page after page is devoted to the sexual experience. I prefer a great story with a little love act but this was way too much.
3,bored out of my mind,"I usually have a book on my nightstand to read before i go to sleep. this book puts me to sleep within a few pages. this is one of the few Garwood Historicals that [...], and I'm discovering why. once Elizabeth marries Geoffrey, she decides she's in love with him. It was like she realized how far into the book I was, and said, ""Oh yea, I'm supposed to be in love at this point.""Not great. But good for sleeping."
3,This One Was OKAY,"Geoffrey and Elizabeth were fine, the story was okay, but something was missing. It was nearly a copycat of some of JG's other novels, which is fine by me, but only if the book can stand on its own, which this one couldn't. I found it boring."
3,Skip this one,"One of her first and definitely not her best. Very stiff, uneven, choppy writing. Borrow it, don't buy it, if you really want to read it."
2,What a jerk!,"I happen to love Garwood's writing style, intrigue, and (of course) romance; however, this novel fell short for me. Geoffery wanted Elizabeth for her striking independence, charisma, and strength of character in the beginning, but then he spent the entire novel beating it out of her. Maybe I'm overly romantic, but when I read a romance novel, I want the sweeping hero--not the pigheaded lout.Despite this lackluster novel, I will continue reading her historical novels and enjoy her strong-willed female characters and dashing heroes."
2,Very disappointing !,"I am an enormous Julie Garwood fan, and have treasured the time I have spent reading all of her other books. Sadly, this book fell far below my expectations. The writing style didn't even seem like the same author I'd come to know ! I found the story to be disjointed and unengaging and the characters very flat. I would reccomend other Julie Garwood fans to re-read the Highland stories or the Claiborne ones, rather than waste the time on this book. It would be time much better spent."
4,Great Garwood!,"I really enjoyed this book (there are not many JG books that I have not enjoyed) and didn't want to put it down. I will have to say, if you like bantering, this is the book for you! Garwood pushes the envelope with the bantering between Elizabeth and Geoffrey, but I never felt ""get over it already"". Their clash of wits is comical, but in true Garwood style, she tailors her readers a fine story where you fall in love with both hero and heroine who are damaged goods. Definitely recommend!"
5,Suitable for continued listening,Not a big Techno fan myself I do rate this album equally high as the 2001 tripomatic fairytales. It's a milestone in Ambient music. The intruiging compositions make this album suitable for re-listening over and over without ever getting boring. I would consider it one-of-a-kind and in the same time 'best of genre'.
3,It's ok,"This is essentially a piece of silicone to wrap your cowon in. In my opinion it's not worth the 25 bucks. It doesn't come with a screen protector, which is why I bought this in the first place- to prevent fingerprints all over the screen. It has cut outs so you never have to take off the case, even for the reset button. The cut out for the joystick thingy hole is a little too small, so you have to learn how to use your joystick thingy all over again. The clip isn't very flexible, but it's definitely stuck on well, and you can take it off if you want. It gets dusty, but you can't exactly see it. It has better grip, looks cooler (IMO) with the cover on. Overall an ok product, but there's plenty of room for improvement."
4,Brought my Laptop back to life!!,So I have a Gateway ML3109 laptop pretty sturdy but with a 1.6 ghz single core not much good for much. So I upgraded to this 2 ghz dual core (also put 4gb of RAM). The difference is pretty great lots of things improved boot time and just opening an application is miles faster. Got for around $65 so not complaining. I would like to warn everyone that there is a bit of work involved with changing a cpu in a laptop worth the trouble. Out of date processor but it keeps my laptop going.
4,The Barn,I thought this book was great. It was really good. I loved it and I think you should read it because it is really really really GOOD!!!
5,"Reading Until ""Midnight""/By:KLG (grade 5)","On a cold,rainy night in an imaginary land called Pergamentio, Fabrizio, the servent-boy, sits on the chili floor by the door. Sudenly a loud knock at the door startles Fabrizio. It is a knight form The Kings Castello calling upon Fabrizios master, Mangus The Magicain. The Princess claims she is seeing the ghost of her brother everynight in the same niche. Is The Princess lying about the ghost and trying to get her way out of something or is she telling the truth?I absolutely loved this book because it has action and adventure packed in every page. Avi realy put his effort into Midnight Magic."
3,Midnight Magic is magestic,"i gave this 3 stars because i do not remember too much about it. i read it in fourth grade (i am an advanced reader, this book is for basicly 11-15 yearolds!) i do remember that i frll in love with the caracters. they are so real. now i know that you (HP) Harry Potter readers can get bored of the average spells and magic and dark arts but you won't get bored of this. i am a huge HP reader and i like this a lot, no a heap, no a state, no a countery, no a contenint better. i still like Harry and all that, JK Rowling but this is hands down. don't worry, 1,2,4 were good. Avi is a great writer from Ragweed to this book. i love Avi. he or she is an awesome writter. thanks for ALL the great books!"
1,"the book "" midnight maigic""by avi","this book is interesting for peole who like to read about fantasy,wizardry, or magic. the book is about a magician whom is banished from usuing his powers but is then asked by the king to use them again for his daughter. to find out more about the book, read it."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This is one of those books that keeps you up at night because you're just not able to put it down! Congratulations to Avi who, once again, has created an adolescent novel full of interesting, complex, and captivating characters. This story is packed with vivid, enchanting descriptions, including those of the castle, the hidden passage ways, the surprising twists, the secret conversations, and the mysterious ghost. Additionally, the gentle use of medieval language serves to establish the setting well, without alienating readers who would normally be ""turned off"" by such dialogue. As a teacher, I've recommended this book to many of my sixth grade language arts students, all of whom, upon finishing it, immediately ask for another just like it."
4,Mrs. Woodard,"This book was silmar to Harry Potter in a way. The ""magicians"" servant believes that there is a gosht haunting the princess. When the ""magician"" is called to the castle to get rid of the gosht in two days by magic, the ""magician"" had to prove it is a joke, otherwise he will be beheaded! The servant tries to make the ""magician"" believe it is a gosht, but he tries to find reason out of it. The ending of the book will surprise you and you might think differently of goshts when you read this book."
5,A wonderful page turner,"This book is a suspenseful & page turning.I absolutely loved it. It has tons of twist and turns, unexpected characters and situations and your eyes stayed glued to the book to the very end. This book is a wonderful, page turning book!!! The only bad part is that when it ends you want more. You should definitly read this book no matter WHAT!!!!!"
2,Slow Moving but Clever,"'Midnight Magic' was nothing I thought it would be. In truth, I wouldn't have finished the book if it had not been required. It was very slow moving, drawing out the story over a course of three days. The 'magic' was cleverly crafted, but a let down because you were just beginning to believe that it might be real. Fabrizio, the main character, began to work on my last nerve with his 'wise quotes'. They were clever as well, but too much of a good thing can be sickening, which in this case it was. The plot was simple and rather predictable. In short, 'Midnight Magic' has some interesting engineering bits of 'magic' but it offers little else. Appropriate reading ages for 'Midnight Magic' would be 9-12."
2,BLAH definitely not Avi's best read Lord Kirkle's Money!!!!!,"Boring, Boring, One book that I do recommend is Lord Kirkle's Money, that will keep you hanging and wishing for more. Oh and this was just BLAH."
5,a truly amazing book with everything a great book needs,"This book is about a boy named Fabrizio who is an apprentice to a magician master named Mangus. He was given a pardon from the king which saved his life, he was charged with witch-craft which was illegal. So when the king's daughter is being taunted by a spirit he calls on good old Mangus thinking that he can just snap his fingers and rid the spirit of the princess for good but it's not that easy. Also to put even more pressure on Mangus, the King's adviser count Scarrzoni, whom everyone in the counrty knows has the real power at court, threatens Mangus that if he doesnt' rid princess of the ghost he will kill him and Fabrizio.but why would count scarrzoni go to so much trouble to protect the princess who hates him?"
2,dissatisfied,"I've used this pack twice for trips into the grand canyon. The pack does not hold its strap settings, with the upper shoulder straps loosening consistently as the pack drifts further away from my shoulders. The lower shoulder straps also needed frequent adjustment. Pack squeaks constantly, as discussed in others reviews. Pack has good storage and zippers, but I bought it for backpacking, not as a duffel bag."
1,Fell apart second time out,This pack fell apart the second time I took it out. The plastic zipper on the front broke and couldn't be zipped. Then one of the straps ripped. The stitching is pretty weak. The velcro adjustments for the frame don't hold.
3,Not as big as I thought,"Durable. Reliable, even at heavier weight. Good pack overall. Used it for a medical mission trip to Haiti not for hiking or camping and found that it wasn't great at fitting everything I needed to bring. Would say it's a good back pack for the price. Served me well."
3,"Useful, but at times discouraging","The first half of this book is largely another rehash of all the reasons NOT to go to grad school. I appreciate his honesty, but if you're trying to make up your mind whether or not to go, this book will depress you beyond belief (having successfully completed a program, why is he so bitter?). Once you decide, however, there is lots of practical advice for navigating the maze of grad school."
3,Didnt really tell me anything I didnt already know,"I can appreciate what this book is trying to do, and I can see some merit for a student that is completely new to the concept of obtaining an advanced degree. However, for me, and I would think for a lot of students that are pursuing a degree in a research based field, this book will have little use. By the time I had started applying to graduate school, I has been in a research environment for multiple years as an undergraduate, and through my research and talking to my adviser I had learned most of the things that are mentioned in this book. I suspect the same will be true for many students in that situation."
2,Totally out of date and not very useful,If the advice in this book isn't self-evident by the time you get to grad school then you shouldn't be in grad school. I don't need to read a book to tell me that I need a quiet study place or that I need to use a calendar to keep myself organized. It's also wildly out of date. The book advises you to use a Palm Pilot or Lotus Notes to stay organized.
3,In Serious Need of an Update,"This book contains good advice but some of it is so ridiculously out of date I laughed out loud. For example, in the chapter on choosing a school, the author asks, ""Will you have easy access to a word processor? Word-processing capability is crucial for writing your thesis. Is there free or cheap computer time? Is there equipment, preferably personal computers and laser printers, for producing graphs and figures, or will you have to draw them by hand? The time differential here is hours versus days or weeks."" The most current edition dates back to 1997. I found myself wondering what is no longer true. Surely more than computing has changed."
3,Too biased towards Ph.D. interests,"While part of the title is, ""Earning a Master's or a Ph.D."" the book focuses more on the interests of someone pursuing (or about to pursue) a Ph.D.Even still, it does contain a number of helpful hints with regards to Master's degrees.I would have given it four stars but I'm disappointed that it's so Ph.D.-focused."
3,"Some useful advice, some common sense","Like a lot of advice books, this contains a mix of useful advice and common sense. It's good to get a sense of the problems that can happen to students. At the same time, I can't say anything in this book would have changed what I did in grad school (I made mistakes, but not the ones in this book). I'd say my biggest criticism is it's treatment of networking. Everybody ""knows"" that networking is important to get a good job, but the key question is how do you find that key contact who will vouch for you? I feel like this book is useful for people who haven't thought much at all about these issues, but probably won't give you what you need to really excel."
2,A very expensive waste of time,"The ""updated"" edition is incredibly outdated, especially the information on how to use technology to stay organized- I thought the entire purpose of a new edition was to add new information and resources! And then detailed instructions on how to use word processing software from 1988!! The rest of the book is mostly advice on how to kiss up to the faculty and how to make social contacts to advance your post-grad school career. This grad student was highly disappointed. Don't bother with this one."
4,It's a quick read,The most you can expect from this is some stories which give you insight into what to watch out for and avoid.
1,Didn't help me,"This book isn't worth the money, at least not if you're serious about getting into a good program. Its not a total ripoff, but there are better books. I bought a lot of them last year, and most of them are quite similar, in that they mostly deal with common sense issues. This is one of them. What most students really need is advice about the things that would never occur to them -- not just the obvious things. Luckily for me, I did get accepted into a Psychology grad program on my first attempt (In fact, I was accepted at 3 out of 6 places I applied to), but looking back on the whole processes of applying, only one book really told me what I needed to know beyond what I already knew. That was the Winning Strategies book. My girlfriend is using it now and its giving her some great ideas. The book by Peters looks good, but doesn't live up to its promise."
5,A Must Read for All Thinking About Grad School,"This probably the best book that I've found that describes the grad school process: from deciding why you want to go, to how to set up your office. Dr. Peters does a wonderful job at anticipating the questions one might have when one decides to go to grad school, from the economic to the psychological to the sociological. This book helped me affirm my commitment to getting my PhD, with a more realistic view of what is ahead.When I become a faculty member and am put in charge of overseeing new graduate studens for a department, this is the one book that I will recommend to all the stduents. It is the best $... you'll ever spend.Great book!"
3,Getting What You Came For: The Smart Student's Guide....,"Like many of the other reviewers have already said, Getting What You Came For is an invaluable tool for grad students. As informative as it was, though, it was just like all of the other stuff you end up reading in grad school, pretty stiff and boring--not that there's anything wrong with that...I bought this book along with another grad school guide called Playing the Game: The Streetsmart Guide to Graduate School. Both books contain excellent information, but Playing the Game was really funny and easy to read, too. Between the experiences related within these books, you won't likely be blindsided by any of the typical garbage that slows people down and makes them miserable."
3,Dated,"Desperately needs updating. Advice on computers is somewhat laughable, and job situation has likely changed substantially for some Phd's since this was written. Other aspects may be useful, hard to tell without experience..."
5,USMC in Vietnam,"This is captivating read, It reveals how Westmorland was caught with his pants down (in my opinion). And that the american civil and us Army Generals didnt learn from the French/Viet conflict"
2,A disappointment,"*The Golden Age of Promiscuity* is a dull roman Ã  clef about Robert Mapplethorpe, Patti Smith, and Jim Carroll. It even features a moralizing cameo from Gaetan Dugas.Don't read this book - go for the real thing instead: *Mapplethorpe: A Biography* by Patricia Morrisroe, ""Horses"" by Patti Smith, and *The Basketball Diaries"" by Jim Carroll."
2,A bit ahead of her time,"Dora Roper's book, Food for the Traveler, was published in 1916 and it was a bit ahead of her time.This book is full of how vegetables are better for you than meat, taking good physical care is important, and you also need meditation time to feed your soul. Physical, mental and emotional are all tied together (uhm, yes, that is true). But everything should be done in moderation. And some people have special dietary needs (ie: allergies or intolerances) that have to be taken into account, even back then, which I am sure happened.I did not care for this book. Mostly due to the content. Interestingly as it was, she sounded like a quack. The writing style was fine, easy to follow. No formatting problems that stood out. Good for those who want to live a more 'pure' life with a early 1900's twist. I wonder how well received this was when it was first released back when."
1,"Uuhh... Yeah, OK","What was Don thinking (or why wasn't he thinking)? I don't know whos idea it was to put Don into this kind of prodction setting, but it failed miserably. The only exception is the song ""1967"". I love Don Mclean and have most all of his albums whick I love, but this one has got to go. I guess every artist (espeecially one of Don's artistic integrety) is entitled to have a clunker or two, this one happens to be his."
1,Low ebb for Don McLean,"""I hate fashion, I hate it with a passion..."" McLean thumps out in this clumsy admission that he really doesn't have anything to offer us in these modern times. Headroom is neither fashionable nor passionate - it's just plain awful. On this album Don McLean seems to have forgotten how to write and how to sing. The title track is a tuneless list of modern maladies - the only thing he misses out is this record. It can only prepare you for worse to come on an album I guarantee you will play only once."
2,Don't buy it unless you know how to configure it,You won't be able to get any help to setup unless you pay $300.00 an hour to Nortel which might cost more than the router itself.
5,Stealing Heaven,This is such a wonderful book about a young woman's live with all her joy and sorrow. I would recommend reading it. Anyone can relate to Heloise and really enjoy this book. The book begins as a great love story and Meade takes Heloise's journey from there. P.S. I think all ages would enjoy this although I am seventeen.
4,Finding the restaurant?,"There is a restaurant in the first part of the movie where Maggie and Larry meet for the first time. It is right on the ocean, you can see the waves through the window. My husband and I have been there and can't think of the name of the restaurant. Anyone out there know?"
5,Underrated Gem,"""Strangers"" was a movie I'd never heard of before I caught it on AMC one Saturday, and I thought I'd seen most of the movies of the 50's and 60's - what a fantastic and engrossing film. This is the film that made me finally pay attention to Kirk Douglas (I realize that's pretty unbelievable!) he and Kim Novak, Barbara Rush, Walter Matthau and especially Ernie Kovacks are wonderful in their roles. Kim Novak is unbelievably beautiful in this movie and she conveys her characters vulnerability and conflicting emotions quite well. Kirk Douglas comes off calm, strong, but unhappy and frustrated in both his marriage and career. I love the early 60's suburbia atmosphere and even the accompanying music. I hope this movie will soon be released on DVD so that more people will discover it."
5,Re-release this gem!!!,This gem of a movie should be re-released so humble people like me can afford it!!
2,borring!,"This book was [no good]! The reason why I think The Snowman by R.L.Stine is boring is because nothing happens at all in this book! And besides you know that snowman on the cover, well the book doesn't even have anything to do with a snowman! the only part in the book that has to do with a snowman is that a boy that Heather meets with the nickname of snowman takes Heather to a special and beautiful secret place in the forest next to the park and they got the idea to build a snowman, and that is the only part is the story that has to do with a snowman. So I have no clue why in the world the book is called The Snowman..."
1,We've Been Tricked!,"Ok, at first when i looked at the cover of this book, I'm thinking, ""Gee, there's a snowman on the cover, and this is a horror novel! Hmm, I guess the snowman is a killer! Wow! I really think this book would be good!"" After that, i purchased the book with pure happiness and excitement. After I've finished the book, I've noticed that the book had nothing to do with the snowman on the cover! Big deal, they build a snowman, the guy has white hair--what does that have to do with the snowman on the cover!!!! It's so annoying. The"
3,Average Horror Read,"Since her parent's death, Heather has been living with overprotected Uncle James. She hates the man. She thinks he is only after her inherence, which she will receive when she turns eighteen. Until then she is spending her time working at a diner and dating her kind-of- boyfriend, Ben. Everything changes when she meets the tall ice-blond, Snowman.Heather instantly falls for Snowman's charms. She soon gives him money to help with his family, but she does not know he does not have a family. He does not even go to her school. Then, her uncle goes missing. Could Snowman be involved? Is Snowman a cold-blooded killer?The book cover is a little misleading. This book is not about an actually snowman, but a mysterious boy whose nickname is Snowman. There is not much of a plot to go by, but there are some twists and turns that make this book worth reading. I would like to add that this book is written for Young Adults and not for children."
2,A pale substitute of the great Don Gibson,"All of Gibson's recordings after 1968 (his last year with RCA)have this ""sound-alike"" quality, a cheap imitation of the great recordings Don made under the watchful eye of Chet Atkins, during his RCA years. To hear Don Gibson at his best, be sure the label says RCA, not Hickory."
1,"Beware, NOT Original Versions",I bought this cd a little too fast and did not notice it was from a knock off firm and the resulting recordings are pale imitations of Don's original hits. This one goes in the trash bin while I seek out the real stuff.
5,Good Gift,"I bought this as a gift for a young rider. George Morris gives a lot of great advice on not only the basics, but much more."
5,The Hunter-seat bible,"I set a goal, less than two months ago to return to riding (10 years ago, I was a walk-trot) and learn how to jump before next year. Not only am I jumping, I'm the trainer's favorite demonstrator for her more advanced students! My secret is this book. Another trainer told me to read it, and she couldn't have given me better advice (no really, she couldn't). If you're a hunter-seat rider and if you want to really know what you're supposed to be doing, instead of guessing and second guessing your trainers' wishes, read this book!"
1,no holes for anything and paper thin,"There are no holes for the shifter and no holes for the seat risers, there are NO holes. Also carpet is paper thin, about an eigth of an inch thick. There is no EASY installation here, as it says above. This is horrible! It is also NOT molded and autopartsway has no customer service, no one to answer their phone, just an email and no replies from them. I would NOT recommend them as a seller. Save yourself the frustration, do not buy from this seller."
4,Great Pop Trance,"Some people might be offended the great driving Mick Fleetwood drums are not really present anymore but if you love to hear classic updated for the clubs (respectfully :-), here are some great remixes of Dreams - basically a completely new version - done with the usual Deep Dish panache - classy, crisp, & cool."
3,Not bad for a mini-cd,"First of all , we must remember that this is just a mini forthe 10th anniversary of the group , don't expect a masterpiecealbum ; this time the group had released three experimentaltracks of psychedelic prog-rock that deserve great attention :the title-track (too long , the only error) it's the mostemotional song composed by the group in the last years , instead""debris"" is a mix of the old style of the group with the most recent releases (""hot to measure a planet?"" & ""If_then_else"")and ""broken glass"" , in the piano version (the complete versionwill be released in the new album ""souvenirs"") , that's not badbut nothing unforgettable...a good ""hors d'oeuvre"" , waiting theprincipal dish."
1,Ed Wood would've hated it.,"Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is often credited with being the worst movie ever made but I beg to differ. At least that movie was entertaining if only to laugh at the not-so-special effects. That's more that I can say for Study Hell - it is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. I'd give it no stars if I could. I'm embarassed that I actually paid good money for it. With one exception the acting was terrible and the dialog was stupid. One actress was so bad I don't know how she got the part unless she's the producer's niece. My wife teases me about buying ""cheesy"" movies and this one's going to be hard to live down."
2,Not Full Round Robin Event,"To say I was highly dissapointed with this DVD would be an understatement. The wrestling is great, don't get me wrong. The quality of the DVD (it skips and acts funny in places) is awful, and they cut several of the matches. It only has 6 of the matches, and 3 of them are of the round robin challenge.I do not recommend buying this DVD at all. It is a rip-off, basic false advertising, and Takedown Masters is not a company I plan to buy products from anymore."
4,Clear Summary of theology,"I ordered this book for a final, summation, class in theology. Having three years of study behind me, it was an easy read. If one is new to the subject, one might need a theological dictionary to look up some of the terms. The book did not ""set me on fire,"" as some do, but it was a fine review of what I had studied for three years."
3,Somebody Else's Kids,"Torey Hayden's book, Somebody Else's Kids, is a very good book for someone that is interesting in teaching children. Especially troubled kids. Torey gives future teachers alot of tips for handling kids so that we will be better prepaired for the classroom. This book also gives good examples of how children will act and how to relate to kids when they have been abused, are pregnant, witnessed a terrible act, etc... This book is must for everyone that plans to be a teacher."
4,Another Hayden book,"It seems that Hayden has a lot to say about her past children. In a way it's good she's writing these.... With these books I feel like I have more of a family of understanding so to speak. Still I wonder...I definetly enjoyed it. It let me feel a little normal considering the kisd involved. I loved the Epilogue (No I won't spoil it). I felt like I was beginning to know these children on an indiviual level. This was the only one of her books that left me with a ""good feeling"" afterwards though. She writes in such a way as to touch the heart"
3,"A wonderful book to read, informative.","Anyone who dreams of being a teacher should read this book. Once you start this book you have a hard time putting it down, you wonder how Torey will make it through the day. This is a very realistic view of the day to day experiances of a teacher. I have suggested this book to all my friends (educators and non-educators)."
5,Must Read,"For anyone who loves kids, has to work with kids, or loves a good story, it is a must read. I had to read this for my Special Needs course and it is the first book in a long time I have read cover to cover. Great story and you fall in love with the characters. I wish all teachers were so passionate and cared so much about their students."
3,It just works,What can I say about a fan. It works. It has been working in the system for over a year now without failure. (The original fan failed in 1 year). I can also say it is quiet and keeps the CPU cool.
5,Great Changing Table for the money,My Husband and I wanted this changing table and crib from the moment we saw it at babies r us but after reading the online reviews we were very scared to spend so much money if the products weren't worth all the money. I have to say the changing table and crib were definitely worth the money we called babies r us and they had the crib in stock so we didn't have to ship it and they let us have the changing table off the floor we still payed full price but it didn't have to be shipped which was great!!! Both pieces are great and are beautiful I can't wait to put it to use in April!!
3,"Bracelet, magnetic","The information from Gem indicated there were 2 options for the Bracelet. One with gold center links and the other was all silver. The order form with Amazon only offered, the gold center link bracelet.I have worn it for two weeks and the gold center links have small worn spots.I would expect it to be more durable. I have worn a Nikken bracelet about 6 years and it shows only minor wear."
2,Don't pinch pennies on Magnetic Bracelets ...,"Basically, you get what you pay for. Magnetics is a fine-tuned theoretic science. I was given a gift of this one and with all due thanks to the giver, it looks OK. Do I notice a difference with those made another upscale, more expensive magnetic bracelet? Absolutely.Keep in mind - buy titanium or the bracelet will be heavier and may be annoying.Don't try to save a buck here. If the job could be done with $19.99 - $100.00 bracelets, that's all that would sell. This is one place where quality makes a difference - big time."
4,Great book on Digital Certificates,"I really got a lot out of this book. While I was not thrilled with the Microsoft-centricity of the book, I don't feel it detracted from the purpose of the book. They go at a reasonable pace, and do an excellent job at explaining complex subjects.I do disagree with some of the other reviewers about it being a good book for learning about digital and/or network security. Digital certificates are a small albeit important component of computer security."
4,Great overview. Not afraid to go into real world examples,"If you would like to get an overview of digital certificates - this is the book. It doesn't go much into the details, but as an interview it's great."
2,Think twice,"Look at the certificates from a Microsoft View, So be carefull when you buy. Examples are not good and practical."
4,A must-have,"This is not the definitive book about digital signatures and internet security, but one of the few of them available today, wrote by 3 experts. Interesting for programmers using Microsoft Platform."
1,Still waiting for the real set!!,"I am so dissapointed that after all this time, this is what we get on blu ray. I am hoping they wont wait too long to release the real un-edited version... But I have strong doubt they will since we never got the SD version. I mean, c'mon, this is an American Movie?!?... stop the gouging and sell us the whole movie already!"
1,I'll keep my Japanese import boxset DVDs,"Why pay 20 a piece again for this blu-ray edition when the Japanese imports, while they may be SD, are the complete and uncut versions of these movies? When the Japanese versions have more special features than this edition? No triple dip for me thanks."
4,Good Valule,"I had already watched the movie, so I wanted it for my dvd collection. Great value, but I didn't realize part of the reason for this was the fact that both movies were burned on the same dvd, just front and back.Would have liked to know this before buying."
5,"Oldschool flavor, with a HD taste","the movies are instant classics, and the HD picture is out of this world. Now I'm a die hard fan and was going to wait for the ""Whole Bloody Affair"" edition, but honestly, Im in the movie biz, and I can tell you that the distribution rights are held by the Weinstiens, and it will probably be on this side of ""who the hell knows when"", and if they ever decide to release it. so go ahead and pick these up, because well probably never get that WBA edition."
5,My kind of movie,"It takes a special kind of person (maybe) to like these movies, but that would be me. It was shipped quickly and in the condition advertised. Good price for both movies together. I didn't care about tons of bonus features since it's all I can do to even find time to watch a movie. Simplicity = Good movie, put it in, watch it."
4,"Great Movie, quite simple presentation","The movie is great. Sound perfect in a hi-fi 5.1 system and highly recommended for that, since speakers sounds crisp and clear. The presentation box is quite simple, so is not recommended for collectioners. Maybe a little box or envelope could be better for that. But the movie is special for home cinemas. You'll have a good time watching this."
5,It's about time!,"It took QT and company 3 years to release this film in its full version. That's quite a wait especially with the 2 ""decoy"" versions out there already (which most of us having probably caved in and bought by this time, sadly). But I'm sure the wait will be worth it!!To finally get the chance to see this epic masterpiece in its completed version is a very exciting proposition. I'm hoping there's quite a few scenes that we haven't seen already.Note to QT: be sure and make Inglorious Bastards in the mold of Kill Bill and not the weak Death Proof. Return to your roots QT."
1,NOT the Whole Bloody Affair!,"Do not buy this thinking it's the whole bloody affair! The reviewer up top says it's a great way to view both films, but at the end of the day you still have 2 discs! The Whole Bloody Affair is supposed to have a new anime sequence attached, the crazy 88 black and white scene in color etc. So, if you want to buy this don't! You're better off buy them separately off amazon USED! Not sure if the Whole bloody Affair is still coming out, but it was screened last year (march/april) in cali by Tarantino. I don't know what the hold up is!"
4,Buy it if You like Kill Bill.....these other people are foolish.,"The Whole Bloody Affair isn't even released on DVD yet.The movies have been out for 4 years and if the whole bloody affair isn't even on DVD yet, then it will be a while for the Blu-Ray anyways.It's been out unrated in Japan since the movies came out, and it's still not out in the US. I think it's safe to buy these, and enjoy them in Hi Def with Lossless Audio."
3,No DTS? No deal...,"This may seem a trivial complaint to some, but I for one won't be rushing out to buy this simply because it's lacking in what should be standard audio for this release. Granted, it will be nice to see the Kill Bill saga (such as it is until TWBA is released) in 1080P, but as an audiophile I'm disappointed to see PCM 5.1 as included with this release. The SD releases of Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 included DTS tracks, and I would have liked to have seen some DTS-HDMA offered for the BD releases of Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2. A poor choice on Disney's part, IMO."
1,"Seriously, READ THIS!!!","Do not purchase this! If you are buying this, I assume it is to be part of a Blu-Ray collection, considering the fact that these movies were released years ago. Save your money for the real thing, when Tarantino releases the whole film, uncut, with the special features. Patience is a virtue and revenge is a dish best served cold...."
1,"There are good kung fu movies, bad kung fu movies and there's this","&#65279;IFC is showing both KB movies on TV. Boy, I wish I could get back the time I wasted.Fortunately I've got a good remote. <click> and the pain is less. Wooden acting, rotten dialogueboring action sequences. Painfully bad. I rate this somewhere below Crippled Masters.I'm going to watch Dirty Ho and Princess Iron Fan and clean this from my mind."
1,Why does it gets nc-17 rated?,"I'm a fan of Tarantino. I just wonder if the set get nc-17 rated, what caused that?"
4,Someone told me I would like this movie....,"A friend told me I would enjoy watching these two movies. I guess I have not had enough time to relax in order to be in the frame of humor that is being shown. Watched twice for the humor to catch on, but it hasn't hit me yet."
5,Great movies for good price,"I looked around for these for a while and was lucky to find a two pack for a great price. Their selection was good, and I plan to pick up a few more gems I haven't seen for a while."
3,This was a gift,"This was for my little brother. I have seen both before, and I think watching it a few times is alright. I like strong female characters in movies/books."
3,Neutral at this point,"Well I'm still waiting for the real exclusive Kill Bill movies to be released. This is one of my all time favorite American movies so I want it to be special too. Next time, it should come in a box set like Harry Potter packed with extras and maybe Kill Bill gadgets (say a shuriken LOL). As for the comment about having only 1 Bluray disc with 2 movies, I don't think that's what the person meant. Because this seems to be two separate movie deals instead of one. What I want is 2 bluray disc combined with specials on both disk packaged into a special collector's edition."
1,Cheaper if bought separately,"This review is not for the movies themselves, but for this combo deal. It really isn't one since it is being sold for about $37 plus shipping. Volumes 1 and 2 can be bought individually for about $14.50 each (total of $29) with free shipping on Amazon. The 2-pack doesn't get you any extra features or anything else."
3,action,"I thought Uma did a great job with her athletic abilities required for this movie, however, I felt the movie lacked substance. It was like bubble gum for the mind."
4,Great Price on two films that are Q.T's masterpiece of Kung-Fu,"Well, to say that I loved both of these films is an understatement. I loved them so much I had to buy them when they came out on Blu-Ray."
4,Fake blood never looked so good.,"Quentin Tarantino has delivered a feast for the masses with a side of water, cornstarch and some red food color. As always they are great movies, but the picture quality stands out amongst other live action films. Double Dipping for these movies was a treat especially at the price."
4,Kill Bill series on blu-ray,"I wish there where on 1 Blu-ray disc instead of 2, but oh well. The video quality is outstanding. Glad I got them."
3,dissapointed,"When I think about a box set I assume the DVDs come in a different type of packaging so that makes it different from all the other ""regular"" boxes. This item was just the two movies in their ""regular"" boxes wrapped in plastic. I got dissapointed because I expected something else. The dvds don't even have a different the cover or at least sometihng similar to the image shown above. It would have been the exact same thing as if I had purchased both movies from a store a couple of blocks from my house (even cheaper)."
2,Kind of sucky,Mediocre sound quality. Every person I tried to converse with had trouble understanding me. Quality not sufficient for use. Suck level: Alpha!
1,blue ant,this product when I have it Ilike too much but I only spoke less than 2 hours and when you get charger it charge quitkly thats the reason I dont like it so I decide to send the back and this is the time that I dont have answer of the other product.
4,BlueAnt Bluetooth,Works great! Sound quality is very good. Love the two line set-up this product has.
5,Spencer is the one I want!,That's what my grandson says and he loves Thomas and Friends - the wooden railroad - loves them all and grandmom can't say no! Good buy...
3,Used product,"I purchased this product as a Christmas gift. I would never have bought a used, worn product. The description never said that it was used or worn. When I finally opened it to wrap, it did not come packaged or with an invoice/sales receipt. After taking a look at it, I noticed it was chipped and the paint was severely worn in some places, not an ideal gift for a little boy who love Hero of the Rails. I am very disappointed with the quality of the train and the fact that it was not made clear in the description."
5,LOVE!,We love Spencer! The real wood is fantastic! Looks great on the track! My son also likes to sleep with him. Can almost never go wrong with Learning Curve!
4,Xmas gift,it was one of the toys bought for Xmas. I assume my grandson likes it although I have no idea as they do not live in my town.
1,disappointed,I was really looking forward to this CD. I had heard it before at a friends and loved it. How disappointed I was when I received it.CD skipped and stuck. It would be more trouble than what I paid for CD to send back.
5,"True, Real Country","I do not like new country. I like old country. I like Tanya Tucker.This CD is full of genuine country songs, such as ""Pecos Promenade"", ""San Antonio Stroll"", and ""Can I See You Tonight"".Tanya's talent is outstanding; her songs are superb; her style is genuine country.There are no words to tell the depth of quality and authenticity of her songs; it is astronomical.Tanya Tucker, needless to say, is one of my very favorites."
4,I think this is one of PAtricia's best books.,"This is a great book! It's very interesting. Eleret is brave and headstrong, yet naive, Danner has a big head and tries to act tough, and KArvonnen is the prankster and very likeable. This book tells a great story and I would recomend it to anybody!"
5,Cameron Goodfellow's review of Raven Ring,"The young Cilhar women Of the Mountains of Morvik, has to go to the city ,when her mother mysteriosly dies in action.She is up against many enemies of long past. The Syaski, a warrior ninga race of assasins, and the Shadow - Born.Another one of the four races of Lyra. The shadow - born are sworn enemies to the Cilhar. All this leads to one thing.Another masterly written novel by Patricia C. Wrede.Cameron Goodfellow"
5,Great book by one of my favorite authors,"This book has everything: fantasy, mystery, humor, and a little romance. Eleret is much more warriorlike than Patricia C. Wrede's other heroines, and the exploration of culture clashes in Lyra is fascinating. The story has a dark edge which is deliciously spine-chilling, and it's such a page turner that even though I've read it more than once, I still have to stay up all night to rediscover the ending. Basically, it's a fantastic book and you should read it ASAP! ^_^"
5,SUPER GREAT EXCELLENT FANTASTIC SUPERB BEAUTIFUL,"I LOVED this book!!!! I can't think of enough wonderful words to describe it!!! You have GOT to read this book!!! It has lovable characters, and an original plot. There were many different, detailed cultures in the world of Lyra. I wasn't hard to follow at all!! I've read it more than 3 times, and each time discovered something new. READ THIS BOOK."
5,"Good book, read it.","This, like other Patricia C. Wrede books, has an element of romance... but it's much better done than in the other ones. Most of the characters are very ordinary, but the few that stand out, especially Karvonen, really stand out. The boook is sprinkled with humour and mystery and is overall a very good book. I reccommend it to anyone who likes stories set in a pre-industrial type realistic fantasy land."
4,fantasy and mystery,"Eleret heads off to the city to retrieve her soldier mother's things and backpay after she dies in a border skirmish. From the moment, she sets foot in the city however, thieves are after her in search of her mother's black raven ring, a heirloom that's been in the family for hundreds of years. Eleret has to figure out who is after the ring and why, since the ring is not especially valuable, before the thieves strike again."
3,Hm,"Raven Ring was a good book while I read it. Now, I can't stand reading it again. I'd rather reread anything else. I didn't like the end either. What was the point of fretting over the raven ring if it was going to be destroyed or confiscated in the end? And good grief, Daner and Karvonen have known Eleret for only what, two and a half days?! And they both are courting her! When I put this book down, I wished that I hadn't borrowed it. A waste."
3,Raven Ring - Not Much of a Story,"The Raven Ring was enjoyable, but I kept expecting more. The story could have been part of a larger work. There just wasn't all that much going on. As it stands, it wasn't very satisfying. I wanted to hurry up and finish it so I could read a more promising book in my Kindle queue."
2,Author needs to find a better review group,"I am not good at expressing my thoughts but this author just doesn't have the experience or maybe ability to provide the depth and artistry of words to make the writing rise above a medium level. It's not like reading a J. K. Rowling, Debora Geary, or Deborah Harkness. The concept may be good but I don't know if I can slog through the poor writing."
3,"Ok, but small and needs special consideration","True dimensions are more like:4.5"" tall (height of the stack)9.5-10"" diameter3"" deep basin.It is probably good for 2-3 people but not much more as this is a smaller pot. Contact area on the bottom is a 1"" wide ring and found this to cause troubles with induction stoves. As designed, gas and charcoal is probably better. Looking for a flat bottom version for my induction stove. The sticker says Made-in-Japan but doesn't seem to have any impact on the quality in this case."
3,didn't work with my windows,"These clips are a great idea, however, the instructions that were included in my order say that they only work on windows (brick/stucco/wood) that are at least 2.5"" deep. I did not see this in the product description on Amazon or the Plylox website. I have vinyl windows and casings that are only 1"" deep. The clips have a serrated edge that pushes against the casing and will rip the vinyl. I think it would damage wood also but it should work great on brick. I am disappointed but I can't blame the clip. An accurate product description would have prevented this purchase."
4,Two CDs for the price of half of one.,"This CD is not for the serious collector. There is no informative booklet and the source of this recording is suspect. On the plus side, it contains every cut from both of the Royalettes' MGM albums: ""It's Gonna Take A Miracle"" & ""The Elegant Sounds of ..."" as well as three bonus tracks. So if you can't afford or are unwilling to pay for the authorized CD versions of these albums, this is a bargain too good to pass up. One caveat: I first discovered this CD in a record store and had to take it back because one cut had a tracking glitch. The CD that I brought online did not have that problem."
3,Interesting for completists,"This book is a compilation of Tim Lucas columns from before _Video Watchdog_ was a magazine, but was merely a column appearing in other magazines. Although much of the video information is clearly dated, it is interesting to see his writing and reviewing style change over the years. (He has for instance, gotten much more sophisticated about framing over the years.) As it is, because of when most of this material was written, the book is really of interest to those who collect oodles of older European VHS releases of fantastic films, and those who wish to have at their hands everything Lucas has ever written."
4,"When he says beginner, he means beginner!","This is the very first watercolor book I've come across that is specifically designed for people who have never picked up a brush before or ever tried to mix colors. He takes you step by small, very detailed step on how to paint 8 different pictures (mountain landscape, seascape, winter landscape, still life flowers, misty hills, woodland scene, crofter's cottage, rushing stream). With extra information on materials, drawing, using the brushes, framing, a tid bit on composition, mixing colors, and painting washes. It really is the best book out there for complete beginners! He explains that ANYBODY can paint with watercolors, and emphasizes how easy it really is if you have the right information on how to go about painting one. It's really helped me a lot."
4,great for amateurs,"Clark's books are some of the most helpful for beginners. Many of his exercises are simple, maybe too somple, but they are fun and they give you confidence. His instructions are easy to follow."
4,Thank you Paramount,"I'm really only answering this in response to the person that asked ""why?"" and gave these collections 1 star. I'm a Star Trek fan, but I'm not rich, and in all honesty I'm not a big enough fan to by the 20+ season collections at $100 or more each to get the few episodes I would watch over and over. These sets are a fantastic alternative and so far the two themes I've seen (Borg and Time Travel) are excellent. I will be buying this one today, and bought the Borg collection the day it came out. Thanks again Paramount for finding a cheaper alternative for those of us who can't afford or don't want every episode of every season of Star Trek."
3,"Repetition, thy name is Trek","I understand some of these fan collectives are designed for specific niches of fans, but come on. They have Endgame on here, which is on the Borg one as well, they have All Good things, which is on the Q one also. It'd be nice if they veried things up a little with these and actually talked with the people making the other ones. Other than that, decent episodes."
1,Star Trek Fan Collective - Time Travel,"I would have loved to watch ""star trek fan collctive"" but my video player displays the message ""INCORRECT REGIONAL CODE CAN'T PLAY BACK"". My vidio is good so it must be a problem with your product. please send another set which is coded to play in Western Australia. Thank You"
2,What we have here...,"Assuming the duplicates accurately reflect which episodes the fans rated highest in each category, then what we have here is a perfect example of ""the tyranny of the masses"". The fatal flaw with pure democracy is that, sometimes, the majority is just wrong.If it wasn't for the exclusion of ""Assignment: Earth"" I'd buy the time travel set!"
2,Do not care for this set,"Unlkike the Borg set, I do not care for this set. Why are there no episodes from Enterprise?"
1,Why?,"I'll preface this by saying that my one-star review is not for the content, but for the idea of the set. With the exception of ""Time's Arrow 1 and 2,"" most of these episodes are ones I'd rate from ""good"" to ""exceptional.""I'll echo the others here and say, ""Why, Paramount?"" I just don't get the reason behind these fan-collective sets. Like a lot of Trek fans, I have all of the episodes on DVD already so, special packaging or not, these sets hold no attraction for me.If Paramout would like to release some REALLY interesting Trek DVDs, they should release the Animated Series. I'd buy that in a second.With Costco now selling TNG and DS9 seasons for $45 each, there's little reason to invest in this."
4,"Good set, but it could've been better","Yes,this is a very good set, but it could've been better. Will someone at Paramount please tell me why Voyager's 100th episode ""Timeless"", probably one of the BEST Star Trek time travel episodes ever was not included???."
5,Love Time Travel,"The selections for this collection is fantastic and includes 4 of the 5 series. I only wish that it included Timeless, a great Voyager episode.Diane"
4,Time Travel collective is a good value,"I have been a Star Trek fan for years, but this was my first ""Fan Collective"" purchase. I felt it was a great value, and was a good selection of episodes from each of the Star Trek series'. I might have chosen a couple of other episodes if it were up to me, but was not unhappy with any that were incuded. I would definitely recommend this collection."
4,Very good collection albeit incomplete IMO!,"Given how many Star Trek episodes have time-related themes to them, this has to be the most difficult fan collection to be assembled of the three (Borg and Q being the others). The episodes in this collection are enjoyable, some very much so, but I do have issue with the inclusion of All Good Things . . . and Endgame. These two episodes are also on the other afore mentioned fan collections. In place of these, I would chose DS9's The Visitor and VOY's Timeless. Timeless is probably my favorite Voyager episode and I cannot believe it didn't get enough votes to be included! Nevertheless, as I say it is hard to pick from so many episodes. Buy this collection for the commentaries if for nothing else and enjoy!"
5,...Sirius rocks,"Is this Kevin Blesh guy serious? So there's an announcement that the station is Rock, or one reminding listeners that they're tuned to Sirius and not a local station. Big deal. No true commercials, a great selection of music (not the same song by the same artists, but stuff you NEVER hear on the radio), and some terrific talk radio (and not the conservative blather of right-wing am radio.) I tried XM and it's ok. But Sirius where it's at. And with these new portable systems you can listen at home or on the road. ... Get Sirius."
4,Enticing story of personal growth,"Heather is a published author in the metaphysical realm, respected and, from all hints, adored. This book is the story of her return to the beginning of her true spiritual rebirth. It is hard at times and painful. Many will identify with Heather's emotions in this writing. It is hard to discover that you don't know it all when so many tell you that you do. It is an easy read, but will leave you thinking for days."
1,I have read a lot of books on the subject but this one sucked!!!,"This book is supposed to be about ""lock picking"" Ha HaThis book has nothing and I wouldn't take it if it was free!This book is not worth the money if you want a good book about lock picking, keep looking because this is not the book.In my opinion he is ""money Bags"" trying to make more money on another book...filling his pockets with money and giving you nothing in return.Steven Hampton did write a good book ""Modern High Security Locks- how to open them.You can make your own opinion on this book but I have read a lot of books on the subject not including the movies I have watched.I recommend getting the movie ""Lock Picking For The New Millennium"" By David Storm -- He does a really nice job of showing the art of lock picking."
2,Easy reading but not specially interesting,"This is a nice book to read on summer afternoons, but it as little simple and some technical details are not well understood. I would recommend it as an easy reading but not as a book which deserves to be in a trekky heart."
5,One of the Best,"A space pirate has been harassing federation shipping lanes. Picard and Co. are called in to lend a hand. They uncover a brilliant tactican using, as his base the hulk of one of the first starships. What makes this book interesting is that always in the back of your mind there is a little vocie saying ""could it be the enterprise?"" a great read."
4,If you like pirates you'll love this one!,"This book is a fast and easy read. It has the dash of Robin hood and pirates sprinked throughout. This makes one of the central characters, Captain Blaze, easy to swallow, despite his methods.The main plot was easy to figure out, once the author revealed that the K'Trall were related to Vulcans and Romulans. Of course, the more militaristic, pointy eared variety were quickly uncovered. Needless to say, the Romulans wanted a straight line, but the author used a few well placed curves. Things unfolded as expected, with the Romulans going home with slightly duller ears.Someday, a SNG book will enlighten the Romulans. Strange how the militaristic Klingons joined the fold, why not the logic Romulans!"
3,"Cute, but not sand practical","This was a great toy when my son was 20 months old and just able to stand at the box and play. Now that he is 2 and 1/2, he wants to sit in it and demolish his sand art. I was so excited to get this home and have my son experience a unique water table & sand box. He loves to play in the water. Unfortunately, we now leave the water side dry. He started dumping sand (and anything else he could find...flowers, rocks, dirt) into the water. After about 5 minutes of play the water is murky and has to be drained/refilled. Currently, we have it on our covered back patio. Therefore, there is sand all over the patio too. The elastic ties had degraded in about two months (a lot of things cannot take the Arizona heat). He still has difficulty operating the crane arm. Overall, it is a cute sandbox, but I think it is best for small children. If I had to buy a sandbox again it would be one that is large and sits on the ground."
2,It would be really cool if it could take a 2y old but....it can't,I bought this a year ago. It is expensive and i expected better quaility for the price. Ties are not holding the lids on so it fills with water and it gets funky sand. The crain broke (the coolest part) last year about 4 months after purchase. There is also not a whole lot you can do with the way its set up. No room for sand castles but more room for a nasty sand mote which happends every time it rains. I would not recommend this product.
4,Lots of fun for the price,"I purchased this sand and water table for my 21 month old son.He loved his regular sandbox but was always getting so dirty. Now this table allows him to get up and move around the table and haul lots of sand. The crane is really fun. However, sand does get into the turning mechanism but that is to be expected. The umbrella is nice to have on it too so it can save him from some sun. Though we needed to anchor it down because it kept blowing away. My son runs outside everyday to play with it and loves it. It is pretty easy to put together if you have a magnet on the end of your screwdriver to hold the screws. Great price for tons of fun."
5,Hours of fun with this sandbox/water table!,"I got this for my grandson's second birthday. He loves it, although the crane/digger was too difficult for him to maneuver by himself. I am sure as he gets older, it will be easier. He loves this toy, and I like that it is off the ground and they can stand and enjoy it without sitting in the sand."
3,Not Compatible with Garmin 60Csx,"Those of you looking for a cheaper map alternative, this does not support transferring maps to the new Garmin devices. Maps are more detailed and better all around...on your computer."
1,useless for backcountry use,"Trails are inaccurate (missing switchbacks), missing (trail 214 at Mt St Helens), misrouted (trail 230 is marked on the east side of St Helens Lake rather than the west), or completely fabricated, as compared with guides by the land manager. Yikes! Glad I cross-referenced before trusting this product with my LIFE."
4,West Region Topo,"All in all, I like it. It has all the features you could want, it's easy to use, and pretty detailed. I love the new feature that allows you to download all the discs into the computer so you don't have to mess around with the discs after installation.It has some roads on it that are closed, ancient and so overgrown you are better off walking through the woods along side the road. It would be nice if they were at least marked as trails. You have to zoom in too far before all the roads and trails show up on the map, so you end up with too small of an area covered on the screen so you have to print several screens to really be helpful.It could be better, but it's the best wide coverage map I've seen yet. I do recommend it."
1,Go RV'ing,"The detail in the mapping is too poor for off-road use. It is better suited for RV or camper adventures. The software also does not support waypoint, route and track transfer with the Magellan eXplorist GPS units via the USB connection. This would have been nice to know prior to reading it on the already purchased software's help menu.I found the software's interface to look childish in appearance and I did not like it. But since I won't be using this product, whether I like it, or not, is immaterial. A costly learning experience."
3,Delorme Topo 6.0,I like the mapping software overall. It takes a bit of fumbling around and using the help desk to be able to use certain features in the program. The 3d feature is really cool. The major drawback I have with this program is it doesn't recognize my Magellan Sportrak Pro GPS; I'm still working on this problem but have not found a solution. Graphics are good but I like the looks of the National Geographic program better.
3,OK,The 3D graphics didn't work on my vista laptop when I bought this about a year and a half ago. Maybe thay have fixed this in the meantime.
4,great features but not intuitive!,"While the software is loaded with features and works great, the user experience is fairly poor.It is obvious that Delorme is favoring long-time users by retaining how the software worked several versions back.But for the novice (like me), it is a very steep learning curve.Standard actions such as mouse-wheel (+ctrl), don't do anything.And while I could read the user manual, I just think that software should be more intuitive.But the features a great!"
2,Weak Construction,"The boot looks okay, and fits well intially. After about 2 weeks use, the stiching is falling apart and some of the eyelets are ripped. The lining of the boot is also ripping, creating pressure points and blisters. The soles of the boot are squishy and noisy. The tread is wearing fast, and not suited for any real use outdoors. If you are on your feet a lot, skip this boot."
3,Too sweet,"These bars have a great texture and consistency - and a good gingerbread flavor. Had they been less sweet, they'd have received 5 stars. Compared to other favorites, such as the oatmeal and walnut, these are just too sweet. My daughter, however LOVES them. So, if the regular clif bars are not sweet enough for you, these are pretty close to a chewy cookie. They are also seasonal - so get some while you can :-)"
1,Ingredients Not Listed ?? Nutrition Label ??,Why are the ingredients of the energy bars not listed? No nutrition label ? I will take the recommendation ofinger Energy Bars are too sweet and pass on this product.If nutrion and ingredients are not available hard to trust this product
3,Might Just Want to Make Some Gingerbread!,"The frosting on top kind of lured me in on these bars. If you like the flavor of gingerbread, you'll find these true to that taste. However, I am used to eating the Clifkidz bars and I have found the big people bars a little too gritty and greasy for my taste. I wouldn't buy again and will stick with my Clifkidz brownie bars-yum!"
2,Don't Be Misled By the Sample Track,"Let me make this short and sweet: if you're interested in this CD based on the sample track sold in Starbucks as part of their ""Italian Cafe"" sampler (""Tu Vuo' Fa' l'Americano""), caveat emptor. That beautiful, upbeat, instrumental track is absolutely NOTHING like any of the others on this CD. All others are sleepy, uninspired, fifties-style vocals."
5,Complete and essential,"Whether you use this book for review, reference, practice, as a guide or a paperweight, you will get great use out of it because it is complete. It is also essential to your library -serious musicians cannot afford to ignore the volumes of experience and wisdom contained within. Almost every single successful trumpet player owns Arbans and has used it to improve their technique and overall skill."
4,Arban's complete Conservatory method,"With this you can say you are really STUDYING music. Big variation of technique exercises, in different scales, and a selection of ""old fashioned"" melodic pieces. absolutly worth!"
4,Good for any level,"Got this for my lessons at school, and it's been very useful. It was recommended to me by many people. It has lots of exercises that work every aspect of your technique. Great book."
1,Terrible,"My order has not been acknowledged. I have not had any notification that the product has shipped, I have not received the product, the vendor has not responded to my email inquiry."
3,This is one of the classics of brass teaching methods.,"Jean Baptiste Arban was one of the first virtuosi of the cornet, and Arban's trumpet method is known by virtually every trumpet/cornet player (and most brass players) on the planet. This book should be in every trumpet player's library. The sections for novices have been surpassed by other teaching methods, but this book can be used by trumpeters at all levels on a daily basis.The introduction is periodically updated by significant trumpet players of the day, whose comments are of historic interest, if not always offering sound technical advise. Supplemented by the trumpet/cornet books of Herbert L. Clarke (another giant in the world of brass players), you may never need to buy another set of practice books!"
4,Arban's method better in spiral bound,"I am a euphonium player. I purchased Arban's method book for trumpet to read trebel clef. This older edition of Arban's, while inexpensive, used a glued binding. The stiffness of the binding made it inconvenient to position on the music stand. I subsequently purchased the more recently published edition in bass clef for euphonium and trombone. This version was about twice as expensive, but is spiral bound and is very convenient to use. BOTH BOOKS ARE THE STANDARD METHOD BOOKS FOR BRASS PLAYERS AND ARE EXCELLENT IN THAT REGARD."
5,Trumpter's Bible,The Arban's Conservatory Method for trumpet is truly the trumpeter's bible. If you practice this book hard you will become good. That is how great player Wynton Marsalis became how he is today. Buy it. Use it. Love it.
3,For people who know nothing about Netscape,"This book is for the person who knows nothing about netscape. It covers only the basic information about netscape. Anyone who wants advance information should look else where. It is a truly a ""for dummies"" book."
1,Fraudulent postings,"I have tried twice now to order this item. Sellers say they have it until they get my money. Then they cancel my order. Every part dealer I have dealt with has been fraudulent. And no one cares. I have found amazon to be awful to deal with. THIS IS A BIG SCAM, BEWARE!!!"
1,First Video Disappointment,"This video screams ""amature"" from the start! Making her debut to video, Minka and supporting cast fumble their way through this disappointing film. One can hardly blame the actresses though as direction is key! A video only for true, die-hard Minka fans ~ All other interested parties should invest in one of her later works."
2,"Didnt live up to expectations, but might have been defective","I received the unit, but the packaging seemed like it might have been opened before, so my experience might be based on a defective unit.My hearing of the other party was fine, but what they heard from me was very choppy. Its almost as if the noise cancelling was cutting my voice off. Is that the way noise cancelling works, and is it defeatable?I wasnt happy with the unit, but I am trying a replacement one and will report back.I am using it with a Mortorola Verizon V710."
2,Flops all over the place,"The microphone may work alright, but no matter how I tried, the earpiece refused to stay in place. This came with neither the triple-flange nor the foam earpieces I would have expected from Shure. None of the 6 rubber earpieces that came with the Shure would stay in place, and the over-the-ear hook was extremely flimsy - its only apparent purpose being to hang the device from your ear so it wouldn't fall onto the seat. When I held the earpiece in place, the sound was tinny and volume very weak.I returned it and bought the ETY*COM mobile phone headset instead, which performs very well - the way this one should have."
1,"Earpiece great, mic bad",I can hear great with this headset but no matter how hard I try I cannot get mic adjusted so that people can consistently hear me. Incredibly frustrating. This is a shame with such a great ear piece.
3,Iffy,"It seems like this works really well in an area that has noise. When you want to use a headset in an area without noise, however, this seems to make it difficult for the person to hear you. Does work well while driving to block wind noise on both sides of the conversation."
2,disappointing sound volume,"I was surprised with the low volume level, especially after reading the reviews here. With the volume on my cell turned all the way up, the earpiece is still pretty quiet, and I even have trouble hearing some people at all. However, I am using the headset with an LG VX3300, which I suspect has a low powered external jack. But, even with a $10 inline Sony earpiece (with a regular earbud that doesn't go into the ear canal), the volume is higher. Also, people on the other end of the line hear me more clearly when I'm not using the headset."
1,Doesn't work well with the Razor V3,Works well with my home cordless but barely audible on my Razor V3 Cell Phone. Very distorted.
1,Not quite best in class,"As an audio reception leader, Shure as predicted had excellent reception. I have tried them all, from Etymotic to Jabra, looking for the best fit in both performance first and comfort second. The QSHB3 had a good fit around the ear and felt comfortable within the ear channel. The unit was quiet with no wind noise thus generating a five star rating for reception. I am rating this item poor overall because recipients could not hear my voice transmissions very well from either of four different positions thus yielding it useless."
2,Too Many Grammatical Errors,There are way too many grammatical errors in this book. I am scared to trust its information.I'm also curious as to how they have came up with the content as I am sure this test is not publicly distributed.We will see how well I do on the test. I will say this book has more material than the study guide you can purchase from the state department.
2,Barely useful,"The FSOT is a four part test that was General Knowledge, Biography related questions, sentence structure and response and lastly, essay. The multiple choice was helpful with general knowledge but the Cliff's help was very little and not designed with the whole test in mind."
1,Did anyone bother to proof read this book?,"I have been thoroughly disappointed with this study guide for the FSOT because there have been so many grammatical and historical errors. As someone who is studying for the FSOT and depending on the reliability of the study guide, all these errors are not instilling any inner confidence regarding the material within this book."
1,Somewhat Useful,"This test prep is poorly written: as mentioned in other reviews, it has some inaccurate answers in the practice tests. Despite this frustration, I think that going over the ""Job Knowledge"" section enriched my knowledge of U.S. politics and U.S. history."
2,Someone please make a good guide for this test,"I gave this two stars because it contains lots of practice for the job knowledge section. However, the English expression test is awful. The questions and answers are poorly worded, the paragraphs seem like they were written by 10-year-old kids (even after you correct them), and there are enough typos/errors to drive you insane. The official test guide (from ACT) is way better. Cut off the English expression section, and maybe it's a 4-star guide."
3,More Exam than Oral Assessment,I bought this book mainly because it said in the table of contents that there would be information about the Oral Assessment. I had already passed the Written Exam. But it turned out to be only two pages long and only gave an overview. It ultimately wasn't worth the money. I gave the review 3 stars because it did have information that would be helpful for the written exam.
2,"Only if Desperate, and Maybe Not Even Then","I've taken and passed the written test and essay twice. Suffice to say, this book was useless. You are better off picking up a college-level GRE English Grammar book and another on how to write a prompted, timed, 5-paragraph essay and brush up on your history and Constitution. And even if you do none of this, just taking the exam will give you insight on what's on the exam. Remember that 1/3 of the exam is the bio section, which you cannot study for.None of this info is outside of the NDA, by the way, but common knowledge through State's site, DIR visits, and the Yahoo FSWE and FSOT groups. Save your money and look elsewhere."
1,Poor Prep Guide,"This book was not a very good prep for the actual test. You would be better off just getting the actual test prep from the State Dept's website.First of all, the book made it seem like the test was different for each career track. This is not the case.Second, the section on the oral assessment is basically useless as it is so short."
2,thank God it's not just me,"Yep, have to agree. This book was a tremendous disappointment! Typos, flat out incorrect answers, obscure trivia for answers, etc.. Glad I checked this out of the library first and did not purchase. Shame too, because they have broken the sections down well, and offer numerous test questions. Haven't made it to the ""writing/grammar"" and doubt I will. Too many mistakes to waste much more time when there are better sources."
2,Still Getting My Feet Wet,"Page 20, question 7 asks about ""Safe Harbor Rules."" I answered ""B."" According to the answer key, my answer was wrong. The right answer is ""C."" The explanation appears to be making the case that B is the correct answer - that is, that ""safe harbor"" refers to rules promulgated by federal agencies that say that if you follow them, you are considered to be abiding by the agency's rules...""This seems to be pretty inexcusable for a test preparation book. A modicum of proofreading would be nice...."
3,"Better than nothing, but not great.","Did not realize ACT made their own guide when I bought this book. It was useful for me to brush up on basic econ and management. However, being made in 2005, it's really dated, especially considering how fast things develop in the world of international affairs. It's not completely useless, but it has grammatical errors and probably isn't worth your money."
3,Foreign Service Officer Wxam,"This book Does not have important key. It makes more confuse,need review for example question."
5,Cliff Book Reveiw,This book was in the form described and arrived on time. I will buy from them again as well as refer anyone who seek my input.
2,"If this book were taking a test, I'd give it a ""D""","I found so many errors in this book's first few pages that I wonder if I take the test, will I have memorized a bunch of untrue information?!?!Overall an overpriced, amateurishly edited thing I probably didn't need. I regret not going for ARCO's guide..."
2,A few mistakes,"I have not yet taken the FSWE but based on the study guide some of the sections seem relevant (english grammar, US politics). Other than that it is hard to take a book seriously that has quite a few mistakes. In the absence of any other guides I would suggest downloading the official guide from the state dept. website (sold by ACT) and using this guide for review. There are also other resources out there - namely the yahoo boards for the written and oral exams."
2,Amateurish,"This book is full of errors and sample questions that are based on errors. Poor editing, really inexcusable. There is no subject matter information other than what is located in the answers. The practice exams at the end of each section does not correlate at all to the information presented in the preceding sample questions for each section.Overall an amateurish effort, very disappointing. Purchase any other study guide other than this one."
3,I have seen the movie XALA not read the book.....,"and I was not impressed by it. The depth of the issues was not tackled in a deep soul seaching way. Much as the movie was done more that 20 years ago, the issues are the same today. It is sad that in such a polygamist setting the voices of the women was not actually heard effectively. The Male character was not given a chance to develop and give a good justfication for taking a second wife or even a third wife, instead it was just presented as greed... simple selfish greed, which i found utterly simplistic and patronizing. I am sure there is more to this story than that. Its nevertheless kind of refreshing."
5,The reality of revolution,"This little book has changed the way I think about nonviolence as a be all end all strategy for social change. Churchill makes it very clear that the oppressed cannot expect the oppressor to some how take his moral position of nonviolence just because the oppressed practice it as a strategy for social change.Another important point I picked up from this book is that proponents of nonviolence CANNOT excommunicate those who want to use violence as a strategy to bring about social change. And usually the be all end all strategy of nonviolence is common among a white progressive elite, not among the colonized, the victims of violence and most citizens of third world countries.As churchill points out, if we truly want social change in the United States, and beyond our borders, we can't expect to get it from a strategy of pacifism only. History has proven him correct.This book is definately a must read for anyone who wants to bring about social change."
1,Thinkers beware,"The history in some books overly outs killer instincts in serious realities ever alluding lightly.From the first sentence, this book is too pushy with its message of assault; if we only look above, the hidden message here is that peace is a weakness in the battle to save the living planet. I have not finished the book, but the first idea that the decency of the human soul is a permissible casualty in the struggle for healthy life is evident. We have got to remember to read what is not obvious, and interpret the intelligent message from amongst the obvious lie in this book that is ""war for peace"". I personally like the idea of the Da Vinci Code and National Treasure heroes who use their intelligence and bank on their inner character to defeat evil.God bless"
1,"Churchill, and his books, are frauds","Churchill is about as ""Native-American"" as his name. He, like Geraldo Rivera, has made a very successful career by pretending to be what he is not. His books only sell because they are required reading, assigned by self-hating ""academics"" on campuses like Boulder and Berkeley."
1,Stone Virgin Left Me Stone Cold,"Stone Virgin is trash -- high-level trash, but trash nonetheless. The title character, a madonna statue, is incidental to the story, and the author plagiarizes ""The Agony & The Ecstasy"" to reveal that the sculptor saw the finished statue already in the piece of marble, just as Michaelangelo saw the statue of David within the large piece of marble in the earlier Irving Stone novel. The three female characters in the novel, in three time periods are anything but virgins, and seem to be sexually insatiable. Their three male partners in the novel seem to walk around with a constant erection. I found the extensive use of untranslated Italian, obviously to provide authenticity, a major turn-off. And finally, I marveled at how the author turned what is arguably the most beautiful city in the world, Venice, into a filthy, polluted cess pool of toxic atmosphere and toxic water. The entire story is contrived, derivative and pointless."
3,This is not his best,"I don't get it. Normally, I would give the Best of John Conlee a five star rating without thinking twice. I love this guy's songs and I love his style, but like where is Rose Colored Glasses? OK, I know a lot of people consider it to have been played to death and something of a cliche, but it should still be on a recording of his best songs, don'tcha think? More importantly, where is I Don't Remember Loving You? This is, without a doubt, his best song ever. It's much better than Common Man for goodness sake. There are some good songs on here, but it's just not complete."
3,2.5 Stars,"This album is a good starter album but John Conlee ""Classic"" album has all the great hits on it that's my opinion. It cost more but if your a Big John Conlee Fan sometimes money doesn't matter."
2,THIS IS NOT the best of John Conlee.,"I love my 20 gr hits c.d., but this ""Best of John Conlee"" c.d.doesn't seem to be worth owning.Here are 4 of his biggest hits which you can find many other places,and 2 that charted later.""Hit the ground runnin'"" and ""Fellow travelers"" both in 1989,are his 29th & 30th charted songs.There are only 4 songs here that you don't seem to find any where else,and none of them were single releases.They are -""Don't get me started""""Where are the peices of my heart""""Till you were gone""""Knowin' you were leavin'"".Footnote: The ""Country Heart"" c.d. has the aforementioned two tracks,plus Conlee's 31st and 32nd, (and last) songs to chart,which are ""Hopelessly yours"" in 1989, and ""Doghouse"" in 1990."
3,Lovely Photos,"The photos in the book were lovely, and the author clearly is very passionate about roses. The descriptions were lush and information was well organized. Reading it was often like listening to a guide at a botanical walk you through their collection, introducing favorites and sharing history. The simplified list at the back of the book, identifying key aspect like hardiness zone and sun requirements was appreciated.Unfortunately, since I had picked this up hoping it would help me identify roses that might be appropriate for my garden, I was left somewhat disappointed. There is little discussion of truly hardy roses, and the set up of the book was obviously geared towards rose lovers indulging in a favorite subject rather than valuable starter info for novices. So it was perfectly lovely and well done book, just not what I had hoped to find."
2,Disappointing read,I love coming of age stories & I love anything written that takes palce in the South but this book was a let down. I'm not sure why but I did not enjoy this book. I think the two friends Sweety Boy & Jacob ruined the book for me. I wasn't prepared for the hint of incest & just didn't like their characters. I felt sorry for Morgan Lee. Her disfunctional family wasn't a lot of help to her.
2,Very disappointed,I bought this book based on all the great reviews and was very disappointed. I personally don't see what all the excitement is about. The author doesn't expand on the characters enough to make you care what happens to them or why they are doing the weird things they do. The book is just unbelievable and odd.
2,"Insipid and weak minded heroine, arrogant hero","This book was boderline awful. After two days of reading it and I still had not finished I had to quit. I was totally bored!! Angeleen does ridiculous things in the name of love and everyone accepts it. Things like this would never have happened during this time. Raurk comes across like such an a55 that I kept hoping she would leave him. The one tme where she looked to show a little back bone, at the slightest push, she is right back in square one. This is the first time I have read a romance novel where I wanted the heroine to leave the hero. I actually didn't want the romance because Raurk was horrible. Did I mention that Ana Leigh is an unimagiitive writier. I have read two of her books and I was not impressed."
4,Very Helpful,This was very useful and helpful for completing a paper I did on the Book of Judith. It makes a great addition to my library.
3,"Good, but critical elements missing","I had hoped to buy this Easy-Guitar Tab in hopes of finding out what chords John Mayer was using for his hit ""No Such Thing.""The guitar tab was fine, but lacked Mayer's fundamental chord structure, by not supplying his chord changes when they are most needed. The guitar chords totally lack the head of the song, which to me is the signature element of the melody. In other songs, there is plentiful chord structure. Why does this tab book not include the chords for one of his most notable and play-worthy songs?I can only say that the authors of this book were negligent and intentionally so. I was not satisfied with my purchase, and would caution anyone who intends to buy this book with the thought of finding ""No Such Thing"" detailed in the book, when it is not."
3,"If I Were a Good Enough Guitar Player, I'd Give a More Thorough Review","I like this book, because I can pick through his most well-known songs and kind of hear a melody somewhere along inside. But I'm not good enough to pin down the riffs properly, so I end up with a very incomplete sounding song.Some of the songs also don't sound quite like they do when John Mayer plays them (I could tell when my much more experienced Uncle played the songs for me) but for the most part they sound accurate."
3,SO-SO,"I've used TAB books and sheet music before, but this one is not as well done as others (David Wilcox for Example is much better and much more accurate sounding). I'm still left with a belief that it is not an accurate representation of what is actually being played by the artist, and I don't care if it says John Supervised the transcriptions or not. It's just not that well done IMHO."
2,not realistic,Game is ok but not a realistic poker game.Computer players are very predictablehands dealt are not realistic - someone almost always has a straight or 3 of a kind.It is a good way to learn other variations of Hold'em.
2,"Fun, but not for serious players...","I received this game as a Christmas gift, and have had some fun playing it as a means to (a) pass the time, and (b) see lots of flops...however, I would not recommend it for anyone serious about improving their poker game. I consider the AI in this game ridiculous, because the bets that the various players make (or don't make) aren't in any way logical to those who understand tight, aggressive poker playing. Even an average player should be able to beat the toughest level of the highest value tournament within their first few tries. Honestly, if you're serious enough about poker that you're trying to understand the theory and the math behind it (i.e. those who are reading the numerous books available on the topic), I'd steer way clear of this game. If you're just looking to have some fun, then it's not that bad."
3,play with real people,I noticed people talked about the AI but you can also use xbox liveand play with real people. which is great. just wish they had a better live setup. trying to find games can be difficult but when you find them online its great...
2,Hire an illustrator,"Only fair. Yes, it gets to the point. But it could be much better if the publisher had used a technical illustrator to help show the plumbing she talks about. What's a joker valve look like? How would you route a vented loop? What makes one deck vent shape better than another?I got as much out of the doing article searches from SailNet.com, past issues of ""Good Old Boat"" magazine, and all the show-off Web sites out there as I did from reading the book."
4,Pretty Good Read,Chock full of good information for anyone who has a boat with a head. Definitely a must have for the boat library.
3,OK book,"The book is OK, but doesn't go into a great detail. I guess I was expecting more ""drill down"" information. Still VERY good information for all boaters!"
1,zero stars,"This is the worst cd in history. Re-recorded versions of Mud's hits, shamefully packaged like the originals. Trash. Garbage. Junk. Don't touch it."
1,This book reads like a bad book report,"I was not impressed by the quality of the writing, nor with the content of this book. Terror Attacks is a twenty page essay concerning the politics of terrorism, followed by 500 pages of useless summary. As seen in the table of contents, these ""terrorist"" attacks span several thousand years. They include the assassination of Julius Caesar, the genocide in Rwanda, and various other violent acts which have taken place throughout history. Several dozen acts are summarized. However, absolutely no link is made between the acts, nor is any thesis presented throughout the rambling chapters.Additionally, there are grammatical errors and typos throughout the text.Don't waste your time on this one."
5,SERIOUS WORK FOR THE SERIOUS STUDENT,"Excellent work, well written. This is not light reading and certainly gives one much food for thought. This is not a shoot-em-up-bang-bang, rather it is a serious work on a very serous subject. I would highly recommend it's reading and recommend you add this one to your collection. I do wish we had more researchers out their of this quality. Thank you Prof. McPherson."
4,A very differnt civil war novel,"James McPherson does it again with a great analysis of why men fought in the civil war and what made them continue fighting after that first battle. Whether it was brotherhood, pride, or religion each side brought with it various and compelling reasons for going to war. The war was a travesty that brought devastation to both sides but if you want to see inside the soldiers minds this is the only book that does it. There are few out there like it and I McPhereson is among the best. This is an essential book for any civil war library."
5,Mr. McPherson answers the BIG QUESTION.,This book has helped the readers 130+years after an eventso great that sits on our minds as we tour the many Battlefields of the Civil War. The Question is why did they fight? Why did they place their lives in danger? The letters were a bright light of awakening. Well written and presentedtext. Highly Recommended to those of us who study not only what happened but why they fought in that great war.
3,A thesis - driven book . . .,"This book is mainly for academics and true historians. It's a short book, which makes it a quick read, but it's not as good as some of McPherson's other Civil War books. (like ""Ordeal by Fire""). His thesis is that Civil War soldiers, both Union and Confederate, fought for three different reasons (or ""motivations""). These are related to reasons why soldiers chose to enlist (enlistment motivation), to fight (combat motivation), and to stay in the service (sustaining motivation). The book seems pieced together to me and the chapters are not put in chronological order like most history books are. He uses so many excerpts from soldier's letters and diaries that it was hard for me to follow. Even though I understood his thesis, I did not like the book's style. I would give this one a pass unless you have nothing else to do!!"
5,Excellent History,"This is an excellent book which discusses the reasons why soldiers fought in the Civil War. What is even more remarkable about this book is that these same themes are present in our current professional soldiers. Anyone who is a fan of Civil War history, wants to understand why soldiers commit to a cause, or what factors influence how society wages warfare should read this book. It is a common theme applicable to many generations of veterans."
4,Excellent EQ for vinyl transfers,"I purchased the PEQ-60 to equalize vinyl and 78 RPM recordings for direct-to-CD transfers, and I've been very happy with the results. No technical problems after months of heavy use."
4,Just what my system needed......,"I have a mid-fi system which consists of a Marantz cd5001 cd player, an NAD C720BEE receiver, a pair of Revel Concerta M12 speakers, and a pair of Wharfedale Diamond 9.4's. The PEQ60 has made a big difference in my system. The treble sparkles without being harsh, the midrange sounds smooth and the bass is tight. I would give this unit 5 stars but I had a humming out of one of the channels from the eq. Defective unit. Amazon was great with the return. They sent me a new one overnight and a shipping label for the return. Excellent customer service. If you are looking to tweek your system, this eq will do it. Recommended."
3,LEDs indicators don't function,"The LEDs indicators in front do not function. The sound quality is nice, my system improved a lot.Very good product overall."
3,Good for Quick Yoga Fix,"Despite the brief 23 minute running time (for the actual practice), Ms Kries does manage to provide concise instructions for a very basic beginner vinyasa flow."
5,Touching,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. It reads like a Bill Cosby ""Little Bill"" book. Very good read"
3,"Malhado, palha. Recomendo sÃ³ para colecionadores fiÃ©is","Para o admirador de Coltrane este vÃ­deo Ã© ""malhado"". A fita gasta quase o mesmo tempo para falar sobre a sÃ©rie Casual Jazz quanto dÃ¡ aos mÃºsicos para tocarem. Takes curtÃ­ssimos completamente diferentes do trabalho que Coltrane fazia na Ã©poca. Recomendo ""The world according to John Coltrane"" que tem takes filmados no mesmo dia, no mesmo estÃºdio mas com takes muuuito maiores. Para o colecionador das raras imagens de Coltrane, no entanto, vale a pena gastar alguns bucks com esta fita ""palha""."
5,See Trane Live!,"There aren't many chances to see Coltrane and his quartet in a live setting, so you have to take it when you get it. This is a great performance that leaves you wanting more.I already knew Trane and Jones were musical geniuses, but I didn't realize how good Tyner and Garrison were until I saw this tape. Both throw down some inspiring solos. Check out Garrisons extended bass solo. With sweat just pouring off his face, you can hear him verbalizing the solo while he plays it.Only 3 complaints: 1. Last song is cut before its complete. 2. Show is only 30 minutes. 3. Its put out by Rhino records. In my experience, you are guaranteed to have less than great sound quality when you see Rhino on the label. Its not horrible on this tape, but it could be better."
3,MARILYN IS A LEGEND BUT..........,THIS DVD IS A COLLOSAL JOKE.MARILYN DESERVES MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.I'VE NEVER SEEN A DVD WITH SUCH HORRIBLE VIDEO QUALITY.THE 3 STARS ARE FOR THE ROBERT SLATZER INTERVIEW ONLY.I'VE SEEN BETTER QUALITY ON A TV GUIDE CHANNEL HALF HOUR SPECIAL.I'M A HUGE FAN OF MARILYN'S AND I'M APPAULED AT THE RELEASE OF THIS DVD.
5,You'll Love It!,"A ""must read"" for every modern woman! Don't let the word ""Bitch"" put you off. It means ""Babe In Total Charge of Herself."" Great advice conveyed in a light, fun way."
4,No need to be bitchy,"This book is not about bitchy women, but about being elusive and keeping your man in pursuit of you. It seems like men have been hunters and in pursuit of something since the stone ages, and nothing has changed. What I got out of the book, is that a woman needs to challenge that pursuit instinct forever."
5,excellent book!,"I love this book--Argov is witty and informative at the same time. She explains why men do some of the things they do, and how to handle these situations when they come up. I'm not very good at translating abstract concepts into concrete actions, and Argov provides a step-by-step what to say and do when certain critical situations/turning points come up in a relationship. Argov will teach you how to handle a man without APPEARING to handle him, i.e., he'll never know. And it's not about being manipulative, either. It's about being strong, confident, and assertive, and then letting HIM come to YOU--hence the chapter entitled Make Him Chase You...Until You Catch Him. In fact, after using just a few of the tips in this book, I've got a guy I met on-line trying to set up a 2nd and 3rd date with me...before we've even had our first date!"
5,MUST READ for single women,Anyone who is dating or newly divorced and finds themselves back in the dating game should carefully read this. Don't chase men!!
5,Insightful & Entertaining,"This is the most entertaining insightful book into male courting behavior I have ever read. A must read for all those women who think being a ""good girl"" is the key to his heart.Its also important to note that the books is talking about catching ""quality men"" not idiots, gold-diggers, or wimps.Every Smart Quality Man wants an equally Smart Quality Woman."
4,"Good Laughs, Good Information, Bad writing","This book is a fantastic resource filled with encouragement and help for any woman who gets walked all over. I DON'T and therefore found the book a little demeaning - like it was talking to a lower intelligence level.Nonetheless, I really did learn a lot about men that I never knew before. I would recommend it as a read even if you think you know everything about men."
2,bleh..,"coming from a woman... so many feminist ideals in here and I don't truly believe this is how men really think. This is just what we want them to think. We want to feel empowered that men love us because they respect us. In all honestly, men can control us through sex because women want and need it more. Just a fact of life a lot of us try to deny."
2,The pages fell out!,"WARNING: This review is directed toward the SELLER not the BOOK! So here goes...I have ordered MANY books here online and have never really had any problems. However, as I began reading this book, I got to the middle of it and the pages began falling out. I literally had to glue them back onto the binding of the book. That kind of worked ok but I would have been much happier if the book was bound as securely as it should have been in the first place. On a sidenote: The book itself was awesome! Of course I didnt agree with EVERYTHING in it, however, I do still refer back to it often just for some reminders, some tips and some tricks when I'm feeling a little lost!"
4,Common Sense Advice,"A lot of her principles and rules are common sense (at least to me) - be confident, don't be a mat that he can walk all over, challenge him etc. I guess the only part where I disagreed with (from my experience) is laying out your cards. I was upfront with the guy that I was dating (still dating) that I am looking for a committed relationship that could lead to marriage and I'm done with ""messing around"" and if he still wanted to ""sow his seeds"", then we can just be friends (no benefits!). Honestly, I didn't want to spend 2-6 months trying to figure out if he still wanted to have ""fun"". And turns out, it was a good move. Still together and going strong ;)Oh, and I read this book after the relationship started. I also read him some of the ""rules"" that was written and he laughed but confirmed he has pulled a trick or 5 from the book (i.e. pushing the limits to see how far he can go).Great for entertainment - can't believe some of the stories in the book!"
3,Just okay.,"This book is not as good as the first one. It's pretty much the same kind of info in a less interesting kind of way. There may be a few tidbits that are added advice to the first book, but it's really not that different."
4,Spot On!,"I read this entire book in one sitting. I absolutely loved it! The advice is spot on and I have found myself struggling to find my own independence in the past when I really liked a guy. The end result was never a good one; this book explains not only why but how to fix it. There were quite a few quotes from this book I actually scribbled down for myself for later inspiration, strength and to re-open my eyes when I find myself falling back into that old undesirable pattern."
1,Bad book,I hate this book for no reason it was terrible I hate this lollipop much I could die in the ground
5,Sherry Argov - Why Men Marry Bitches,"Why Men Marry Bitches digs into the heart of some of the most confusing, tricky relationship issues...and comes up with creative answers. I have tested them once or twice and found that they work not only with men but also in business negotiations. And yes, after reading this book, I am finding it much easier to get dates."
2,Utter misunderstanding of men,"I picked this book up from my female housemate's bookshelf and started reading through it. I was appalled at what I found. The author repeatedly gives anecdotes from men, then proceeds to break the anecdotes down and explain them. Her explanations and extrapolations, however, are utterly wrong. They DO NOT reflect how men think in the least.I was quite disgusted at the uselessly false impression of men that this book gives. Ultimately, the equivalent would be a book for men which explains that women are simple-minded and obsessed with flowers. Does that reflect you? No? Then probably you don't want to read a book that says the equivalent about men.This book may have some good advice about women, for women, but take everything it says about the male thought process with a grain of salt."
3,"Entertaining, But Don't Try This At Home, Kids!","A few girlfriends recommended this book to me. A lot of what the author writes does make sense; however, a woman shouldn't have to play a game just to ""snag"" a good man. It's OK to be a babe in total control of herself, but if you're not REALLY a babe in total control of yourself, what do you think is going to happen when the guy finds out you're a hoax? That you're an insecure mess?"
5,Bitches Part 2 wins again in my book,"Why Men Marry Bitches is just as good as the first book I read by Sherry Argov. She writes like a pro that knows what she is talking about. Women of all races, backgrounds and ethnic groups will be able to realate and apply her suggestions for a successful relationship with a man."
5,love!!!!,i love this book! i cannot get away from it...i feel like i should be highlighting certain parts and taking some notes as well for future reference!
3,Pretty much the same as her first book,"I don't think the material is really all that new. If you've read her first book, I wouldn't bother. Otherwise, it's a good read."
4,Funny and true!,"This is one of the best books on relationships! It's funny and straight to the point. And it's not as ""bitchy"" as the title makes it out to be. I would definitely recommend this book if you need help with men."
5,"the only advice I will actually follow, and it's WORKING!!!","Everything said about this book is spot-on. I am new to dating after 17 years of marriage, and I made the (understandably) ""desperate""-looking moves described in the book with a man I fell crazy in love with! When I read this book, it just reminded me of how I was like when I was young and dating, and why I had several marriage proposals way back then. Bottom line, don't be afraid, try to NEVER let them see you sweat (and, if you do, don't apologize for it, please!) The only advice book out there worth reading, I think, and I've read a few lately."
4,Good-- but I liked why men love bitches better,"I became an Argov BITCH-- Babe In Total Control Of Herself, after reading ""Why Men Love Bitches""-- which is a MUST READ. I had the ""marry"" book on back order and read it from start to finish in one sitting-- it is definitely empowering..Buy the books together, because, while they were both helpful, I found the first book much more intense than the second."
5,This is what I am talking about!!!!!!!!,"As I read this book, I kept saying ""Yep, yep, that's true, that's true. Hun, yep, true that"". Strongly recommend this book to any woman. It will make your dating/marriage life a better experience full with loving moments.Dr. Israel King,Ph.D. Author ofHow To Keep A Man"
4,Good Laugh & Realistic,I think Sherry brought out the realistic facts that some women tend to forget. It's a good and enjoyable book that I would highly recommend women to read.
5,great!!!,"I'm not living in the US right now, but I wanted to buy a book and found it with them for a good price and delivered internationaly. It was great!!! Thanks a lot!"
5,A book for every woman,"A book every woman should read. See also ""Why Men Love Bitches"" and ""He's Just Not That Into You""."
2,Why would women work that hard for sausage?,"I picked this one up because the title was intriguing, even though I suspected, rightly so, that it would be one of those light and fluffy ""cosmo girl"" how-to-get-a-man type of books. It was, however, worth reading, if only for the retort (on p. 130)to the age-old virginity-inducing question, ""Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?"" The retort: ""Why buy the pig when all you want is a little sausage?"""
1,No style at all.,"The title ""Manual of Style"" implies that you will learn how to develop and structure your code. Instead you get 168 pages of utterly useless fluff. The cover boasts ""over 15 examples"", but fails to indicate that each example simply adds a few lines of code to the last one.This would be a decent book for someone who knows absolutely nothing about Java, and wants to learn to add a useless applet to their web page. But if you intend to learn anything useful, skip this book. It would be best placed in the back of an airplane seat, or on the back of the toilet."
2,Poor as a commentary,"People buying this book maay be disappointed. The title implies a rigorous application of Java styles, but thiss does not happen. The book is puerile in the extreme and includes code that is inconsequential in the context of some-one that wants to learn the ssubject, or who wants to extend their technical vocabulary.If you know nothing about nothing - buy it!! If you know the slightest amount - don't make the mistake thaat I did."
5,Beautifully told; a glimpse into a previous era,"Sandra Tankoos has resurrected the life and the emotions of a previous generation. This story, elegantly and beautifully told, will enable a new generation of young people to experience the joys and the challenges of their grandparents' world. I'm going to recommend it especially to teens. Brava!!"
5,Reminds you of all the best that life has to offer..,"This was John Denver at his best, all his greatest hits and then some... This is a absolute buy for anyone who loved John Denver or for anyone who enjoys good heartfelt music. Brings back all the memories of better days gone by.. when life was a little simpler."
2,"If you play guitar, don't bother.","If you play guitar, don't bother with this book. This is a piano book with some guitar chords thrown in. I've played guitar for more than 30 years (also play mandolin) and I am quite disappointed. The beautiful open chord intro to Eagle and the Hawk is missing, the 12-string guitar intro to Rhymes and Reasons is NOT there, and the key for Take Me Home, Country Roads is not original. Compare it to any ""guitar"" book and you'll see what I mean.Piano players will most likely enjoy it, but then John didn't play these songs with a piano. I'll be looking for a better book."
4,Likely all the Denver you'll ever need,"This is the complete works, except for a few songs that may be your personal favorites. Organized almost alphabetically. Decent range of difficulty across the songs, but most should be manageable by intermediate piano players. Also contains a couple of pages with John's thoughts about his favorite songs."
5,Bright Paradise for Anthropology Students,"""Bright Paradise: Victorian Scientific Travellers"" gives a refreshing glimpse into the scientific travellers and explorers of The Victorian Age. It covers the well-known (Darwin, Wallace, and Hooker) to those overlooked and nearly forgotten travellers like the botanical painter Marianne North. It is written without any academic pretentiousness and is ideal for introductory courses in cultural anthropology and European History of the 1800s. The only fault with this book is that it is too short."
4,"mostly helpful, not for Mac","Helpful for beginners and more well-versed users, though very heavy with busy work. The explanations are pretty clear and simple, and if practice makes perfect, you'd be close to that end after completing everything in this book.WARNING FOR MAC USERS: don't get this book. It is intended for the PC version of Office, and even though you can still stumble through, most of the shortcuts are slightly different, and the overall way to do things can vary. It's a mess if you have to take this for a class and have a Mac, so think twice before taking such a class."
3,"Good Reception, Ok-ish transmission for QSHB4","At first, folks on the other end complained it sounded tinny and metallic. What improved it was putting on the windscreen--no complaints since then.It's a little bulkier than most headsets, but can be squished into a pocket or bag without harm.Overall, the Shure QSHB4 Headset (I used it with a Nokia cell phone) performs well, once you've got the right sized earpiece, and several are supplied."
5,Best Lamb Chop puppet to order,"This was not some cheap knock-off. this was a licensed puppet, 100% original. My grand-daughter loved it as a Christmas gift."
4,Adorable Lamb Chop,"My 2 yr. old son has recently gotten into playing with puppets so we bought him a couple for Christmas. This is a good puppet for little hands! I am able to fit my slender hand into the puppet too, but it is kind of hard for my husband. Lamb Chop's mouth does not really open and close so that was a tad disappointing, but her cuteness makes up for that shortcoming. She is soft and so far my son has really enjoyed playing with her."
5,So adorable!,I play with a very young child with special needs. Lambchop likes to tickle her and hide. She is so cute that the child wants to kiss and hug her.The features on the puppet are easy to see and touch which is very helpful.
4,Mouth doesn't open and close,"It's my first puppet so maybe I'm asking too much, but I'd like a puppet that can open and close its mouth, this one doesn't. The arms also just hang loosely.It's pretty durable though, my cats have attacked it many times before and it still looks brand new. And I am keeping it, great price and it's cute :)UPDATE: I noticed some lint on it and some dirt, it may need washing. But do I dry clean this or can I just give it a bath? That's what I just realized, it's light colored and it's easier to see dirt. Maybe I can dye it a darker color and call it Lamb Chop's cousin."
1,Additional Circuitry Required,"I cannot rate this item because I was never able to use it. Be aware that this particular unit requires a 20 amp circuit to operate. At the time of purchase, this was not stated in the description of the Air Conditioner. Standard household current is 15 amps, so check first. If the plugs in your house have an additional horizontal slash in the right prong slot, you are probably running 20 amps."
5,benji & me,Benji & Me is a great book I love this book and also his book-The soul of a horse life lessons from the herd- the book Benji and Me is a reprint The original book is titled Underdog how one man turned hollywood rejection into the worldwide phenomenon of BENJI I bought both copies thinking they were a different book The Underdog one is hardcover and cost less Vicki Jo
3,A Suprisingly Banal Book on Judo!,"Filled with clear black & white photographs of tachi waza, the book: OLYMPIC JUDO THROWING TECHNIQUES (c. 1986) by Neil Adams, presented a surprisingly banal demonstration of standing throwing techniques that do not appear to be competition oriented.Former European Judo champion and gold medalist in the 1981 World Judo Championships in Maastricht Holland, author Neil Adams only advanced throws in this work are: #22, the one armed tomoe-nage (p. 56) which he credited to Kashiwazaki sensei, and a one handed kouchi-gari (p. 46), all other throws appear to be a basic demonstration of the Gokyu No Waza.OLYMPIC JUDO THROWING TECHNIQUES contained a short section on Judo terminology in the back, a short history on Judo in the front, and the author's philosophy and opinion on Judo in the foreward. To compare OLYMPIC JUDO THROWING TECHNIQUES with a similar mediocre book on judo by another world champion, please read: JUDO TECHNIQUES & TACTICS (c. 2001) by Jimmy Pedro,Jr."
2,Not this version,"I love Noises Off, so I decided to buy the script- on Kindle. Do not buy scripts on Kindle! It is very difficult to just go to the page you want or search for a specific scene. Buy the print version."
5,Awesome,This body wash is awesome. The patchouli scent is perfect. Smells just like the plant. I use the regular and exfoliating china patchouli body wash regularly. I highly recommend.
5,Just heavenly,This is my favorite scent of the Thymes collection. Really romantic without being overly girlie. Enjoy.
4,My favorite resource for assessing genealogical info,"This book has become one of my most-used genealogical helpers. It discusses the broad categories of genealogical source info (census, will, land record, newspaper articles, etc.) and comments on the qualities to look for to judge just how reliable the document is. I notched my review from five stars down to four only because the terminology used ventures into tricky-to-follow ""legalese"" in a few places."
1,Should be better labeled,"After you use this product you are going to want to know how to remove it. Luckily I had a small precision knife set for woodcarving and was able to get down into the cracks. The only good thing I discovered about this non-hardening product was that it came out relatively easy. So don't give up. Just be patient, carefully remove it, and then throw the container away so that you never make the mistake of using it again.If the lid said MINIWAX Non-Hardening Wood Putty then I never would have made the mistake of buying it. Instead it just said MINIWAX Wood Putty. Granted if you read the back label it does say it is non-hardening, but I didn't have my reading glasses and the print is extremely small. Even so, it also says ""permanent"". In what possible way is it permanent? Maybe they meant permanently soft and permanently useless."
1,Absolutely usless!!!,The label says in fine print that it never hardens! What possible use is there for this crap? Don't smear this goo anywhere near your project or you will be sorry!
5,These people know books!!!,"I have been purchasing ""Book Lover's Calendar"" for the last 3 years or so, and have rarely been disappointed by any of their suggestions. The summaries are well-written, concise and educational. They have introduced me to some fabulous writers, and prompted me to re-read some forgotten favorites. A must-have for any bibliophile!!!"
1,Don't bother with this book,This was one bad book. I've never come across one so hard to read. The author knows nothing about grammar and it's impossible to track what he means to write. I got 3/4 of the way through before I went out in a snowstorm to get a better book.
1,Don't order this!,"We have the Daisy Rock electric guitar that this case is supposedly made for and it doesn't fit! We can't even close the lid. I now have to return it and pay for the shipping. My email to Total Music went unanswered. Lousy customer service, lousy guitar case."
5,GORGEOUS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CASE!,I bought this for my stardust electric guitar by daisy rock and I LOVE IT! It is absolutely gorgeous I love the interior purple and the outside is so cute!
4,true american hero,"I seen all the movies, and i liked them all.Sheriff Pusser wanted to rid his county of the vermin of societyto make it a better place to live, but as reality sets in,the storey can be set to modern day america and the methamphetaminelabs and the under-funded sheriff's who have to keep law and order in area's where everyone and his brother is a weed smoker and aparasite on society.wish they would change the constitution so more sheriff'scould rid their county's of evil doer's."
4,"""Get stick.""","Walking Tall is one of those rare movies that when you're flipping channels in the middle of thenight and you land on it you just cant look away. I've called in drunk more than once after pullingan all-nighter with Joe Don and the crew from the Lucky Spot.II & III are better than expected, maybe for fans only, but Bo Svenson does a pretty good job replicatingthe intensity Baker brought to the first installment.However, Rhino has botched yet another DVD release in which appears to be a bad habit of theirs as I'veseen these negative comments before. Video and sound are subpar, and the soundtrack is downright ugly.Come to think of it that's some of the worst music ever inspired by Hollywood and somehow Rhino hasfound a way to make it sound even cheesier.The Ghenghis Scale rates the collection 4 Stills, and breaks down this way - #1=5*, #2=4*, #3=2*.And to the boys at Rhino..... I have a big stick carved from a 4x4, I think you know what you can dowith it. haw haw haw"
5,Great story..,"I bought this trilogy not knowing a whole lot about Buford Pusser or the Walking Tall story.. now I'm sure glad I did. All three movies are above great. Buford makes the newer ""action heros"" look sick in compairison, and to top it all off... a lot of the action in the first two movies really happened! I see a lot of people slamming the ""Final Chapter"" as well, but it really is entertaining. I found myself watching these three films all the way through twice in a row... and I'm sure you would too. Really good stuff!"
1,3 months and still nothing - BOO to Amazon!,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift in November. Today is February 2, and I've received notice that it will not be available until April! You've got to be kidding me! If you really want this boxed set, do not order it here, you will be sadly disappointed!"
1,WHAT IS TAKING SOOOO LONG?!,"I ordered this Nov 5th..item was in stock...paid for 2nd day ship. Today is DEC 9th...still no ""Trilogy"" set. This was ordered as a Birthday gift (Nov 15th)..needless to say, I had to come up with another!! Now, I just HOPE this will be here for Christmas!! Maybe Easter?!MISTAKE!!! Do not order is you need this...in the next YEAR!"
5,Better than description,My girlfriend had been looking for this set with no success. I ordered on her behalf and was hoping the item would arrive as described. The order arrived in 2 days--THANK YOU VERY MUCH. The DVD's looked brand new & the box had only minimal wear. Thank you again to the seller for prompt delivery. I highly recommend this vendor and would absolutely order again should the need present itself.
5,Walking Tall Trilogy,"This is a great 3-DVD collection. I have looked for a while to find these movies, then came across the 3-DVD set. All 3 of the DVD's were error free, no problems at all. The DVD collection was received 3 days early.As for the movies themselves, they are great action movies. Watching these made me stop and think about law enforcement people and what their families go through: a lot of work with little to no appreciation.If you want to watch a good action movie, then these are for you."
5,fmab,"omg i havent watched the dvds yet but i have seen all the episodes of all the parts (which are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and i loved every one of them its like the best anime ever if u ask me"
5,amazing!,I'm sad to see the end of the series. The final DVD does not disappoint. Especially the last episodes. The animation is amazing. I love the voice actors. This version of the story has just what I was looking for when it came to completing the story. Best part is the final picture shown in the last episode.
3,Could be Taller,"The beer glasses are fine, but I prefer a taller beer glass so that I don't have to be as careful when pouring in the contents of a bottle. With these glasses, the beer rises to the very top of the rim. Other than that, they are just fine."
3,Bad packing!,I am giving this produce 3 stars simply because a refund was given quickly. The package was damaged during shipping and they did not even try to deliver it..for which I was thankful! I didn't reorder for fear another set would be broke. Several reviews had the same issue so beware when purchasing!
1,Do NOT buy.,"I could not get enough blood to use this test! I'm a nursing student so I know how to prick fingers for blood sugar, and I have done it numerous times. The lancets in this kit are faulty and don't draw enough blood. So basically I just wasted $20 on this from Walmart.Do NOT buy unless you have lancets you could take from someone else."
1,NOT RELIABLE,I HAD ORDERED THIS METER IN THE PAST AND IT WORKEDI ORDERED AGAIN 1ST METER DID NOT GIVE A RESULT AFTER THE QUALITY TEST PASSED.AMAZON WAS GREAT AND SENT ME ANOTHER METER THIS TOO SHOWS A PASSING QUALITY TEST AND DOES NOT GIVE A RESULT.
1,Its FAKE,"Do not waste your money on this fake item. It does not work, its a waste. I tried it and had to throw it out. I did not do it wrong, I followed the exact directions. Its just fake. Get a blood test from your doctor instead."
4,Good Workout!,"I purchased this for 2 reasons...1, to work our at home & 2, because I love Bob Harper! I enjoy this workout DVD. It allows you to pick out different variences and if you follow what Bob says throughout the DVD, you'll get quite the workout. This was delievered to me in a timely manner, and its fun and energizing to work out with this video. much easier than having to go to a gym, especially if you can't afford it. quite pleased with this purchase!"
4,I Enjoy Doing this DVD,"I have done this DVD twice and actually enjoy it. I like that he isn't overly bubbly or fake. I like that the four extras are working hard and don't have time to worry about smiling. Bob seems to kick their butts. Like many other reviewers, the title of ""beginner"" is a bit misleading. I bought this DVD after reading the reviews because I wanted a DVD that I could work up to. I can do most of the 45 minute DVD, but definitely have to work up to some of his moves and don't do other parts of the DVD as fast as he does. I am in my late 40s and consider myself a high beginner to low immediate exerciser."
4,Love it,It is awesome..I gave it four stars because I did it four times and got bored.. But if you are looking to burn calories an loose weight it WILL work.. I move to other programs and when I finish I will continue to use it as an extra workout. Because he really works out all your body muscles.. Love Bob!!
2,Beginner my @$$!!!!!,"Yeah right! I've been sore and barely able to walk for three days! This will be moved to my ""some day"" pile of exercise DVDs, along with Insanity!"
1,no way a beginner's weight loss,Just a word to the wise! This is no way a beginner's weight loss. Very disappointed plan on returning it. Bad title Bob.
5,Looking for a starting point,"I bought this DVD off the mytrainerbob website. I thought it was going to be easy, this DVD is definetly not for beginners but it is a STARTING POINT. I highly recommend this DVD for people like myself that have worked out in the past but fell off the regimen. I would suggest to start with some light weights and work yourself up. Good luck."
3,OMG,"I love Bob Harper, but this is NOT a beginner's workout. I couldn't get through it and got frustrated. I need a beginner's to get me going, but this isn't it. Eventually I can work up to it and keep it in my collection, but definately not beginner!"
2,Not a Beginner Workout!,"I am trying to get back in shape. I can do the Leslie Sansone 2-mile walk no problem, but after about 20 minutes of this DVD, my heart rate was way too high and I was actually starting to wheeze. This is a good workout, and something to build up to, but very discouraging for a true beginner. Also, everyone in the DVD is VERY fit - not much encouragement here for someone just starting. Also,""jumping"" included,which is just recipe for a beginner injury. I think beginners should avoid this workout."
2,"Repetitive, Not for Techies","As another student who was made to read this book for a university, I also found the text to quite repetitive. The points the author is making is spread over 10 pages or more, which makes it hard to focus on the substantive parts. This book is better suited for a philosophy major interested in technology, not a computer scientist interested in philosophy. The book tends to get ""muddled"" itself by introducing broad topics relating to technology which lead to seemingly off-topic tangents. Much of this book isn't noticably insightful either, falling under the ""common sense"" category of philosophical reasoning. The writing is clear, I'll give the author that, but by the end, you felt like you took this extremely long journey without getting anywhere. Seek enlightenment elsewhere."
3,Decent collection,"Nothing to write home about, but a nice set of performances from the Storytellers series, with a few good moments. For the price (and potential length) of a VHS tape, this could've been a lot longer (it's only about 40 minutes)."
1,Lame!,"Reading the reviews, I made the mistake of purchasing this CD. What a mistake. The songs lack both energy and originality. The vocalist (Steve H)is intolerable. Sub-par musicianship throughout. Save your money. This stuff has been done many times over (and much better) by Radiohead...."
4,Marillion finds the sure-fire single!,"Calling all Marillion fans...let everyone know that this is the Marillion album the US has been waiting for. Poppy, yet complex! ""Rich,"" ""Deserve,"" ""Tumble Down the Years,"" and ""a Legacy"" are sure to win new fans. I'd classify marillion.com as a mainstream album, though how can any of us classify this great band? If the Radiation CD comprised Marillion's experimental effort to grunge an audience, then marillion.com leads one to think that the band has finally come upon the magic formula of music that satisfies the old Fish-heads while showcasing Hogarth's magic voice!This album will leave all American Marillion fans dying for a US tour!"
2,Is this really Marillion ?,"A dark period in Marillion's history, the band is leaving progressive music and is trying to get a pop band. Sorry, but if I want pop, I'll go somewhere else, there is a few good pop songs in there, but there ain't no great prog songs here. The first four tracks are just ok but no more than this. The rest of the cd is boring. Another deception for me."
3,"Could be better, could be worse","I was disappointed at my first listen of this CD. I was expecting the exciting style of music Marillion visited with 1998's excellent Radiation. Instead, I found nothing special with many of the songs on this disc.Now that I've had this disc for a few weeks, it has grown on me somewhat, but it's still not as good as Radiation. Go! is an excellent song, as is Interior Lulu (once you get into it) and House, but Rich, Deserve and Tumble Down the Years are all fairly boring rock numbers as is Enlightened.Better than most releases these days (Ricky Martin and Backstreet Boys, anyone), but not among Marillion's best."
2,boring album with few good tracks,"This album I can say is probably the worst album Marillion has to offer. Boring songs like Interior Lulu, Home, and several others lacks the energy of other marillion songs. Some songs are empty feeling messes, While other songs like Built In Bastard Radar, When I Leave You, Tumble Down THe Years bring light to this album, the rest is pretty lifeless. The only people I can recommend this album to, are the true fans of the band. The rest stay away."
2,witzend,"As much as I do love this band, this one didn't strike me well at first and has not grown on me since it came out. A Marillion fan could see the trend coming since RADIATION. M.Com sounds like an 80's albumn at times. A few of the tracks sound a bit too much like Estonia. The band itself has made comments about some of their recent material. This is why the fans are funding the next release, they want back creative control. Still a die hard though!"
3,A respectable collection of songs.,"I'm quite new to the music of Marillion. Besides this album, the only other release I have from them is their best of collection (I got that quite recently). I've given Marillion.com quite a few listens, and while I'm not a big fan of it, I still think that it's respectable. Style-wise, it's not quite what I had anticipated though. A lot of the songs don't tend to be in the progressive direction in my opinion and have a seventies flavor to them (that's not meant as a slight). ""Interior Lulu"" though sounds quite progressive and would have to be the best tune on this release. I knew that these guys were great musicians when I had listened to their collection of hits. The keyboard playing on Marillion.com is also pretty good along with the production. All of the songs on here are decent. This album is good and worth a listen."
2,"Love his work, dissapointed in this book.","This book broke my heart! I have most of his other books, and I was excited that at long last a new collection, or at least a new best-of compilation was finally available. I expected there would be a few overlaps with the books I already owned, but there'd also be some new cartoons that didn't make it to the books. He hasn't published a book in many years, but the cartoons keep coming - surely SOME of them are among the best?But, no. This is a clip job from his prior books - not even a new introduction or any commentary or even a funny opening. Just cartoons taken from the other books and tossed into this one.If you haven't seen them, these are uniformly hilarious in a way that few other cartoonists can approach. But if, like me, you're already a fan, this book is just a rip-off."
5,Amazing Results,"This collection is so great. I use to buy DVDs from another fitness expert, but Jari Love has a very fun and serious rutine. I'm very happy."
2,Not for me,The video's are basically the same. This workout wasn't for me. She is extremelyfit and knowlegable but not what I like in a workout.
4,I'm Not a Beginner ...,"... but I have exactly the opposite opinion from the previous reviewers who declared that this book was better suited for beginners than for advanced students. No way! A total beginner will bog down before page ten. A beginner needs memory massage, rhythmic reiterations, and this book provides no methodology for learning the language, merely an analysis of its grammar as a consistent system. I chose it because I wanted exactly that, an overview of Italian grammar in order to confirm or correct my usage. I understand Italian well enough to watch Italian films without subtitles. However, for the last dozen years, I've been using Spanish and French more often than Italian, and I sense that my latte comes out as leche and my pesto as pistou, with the analogous grammatical mash-up.This is a lucid overview of formal Italian grammar, cogent enough even to make the damned reflexives seem reasonable. I'm knocking off one star because the indexing is quite sufficient."
1,undelivered,"we have still not received this item (5 weeks now)despite assurance from seller (Winston Bookstore) a new copy was being sent ""express"" 4 working days ago! we did receive all other books directly from Amazon, in two shipments, so I'm pretty sure I gave our correct address with the order (we are on file at Amazon and are long-time users of this site). But I have learned now to keep track of outside vendors to avoid in future."
4,It's all numbers,"It's an sect of Judiasm which grew during the dark ages, it's one of those books that make your eyes cross when you think too hard about it. That's why I like it."
5,Great Documentary!! Elvis Rules!!,This is a great Movie history of Elvis Presley's movie career.It's a must see!!
2,Huge glaring hole,"As much as I enjoyed the premise of Air Jaws II, when they took the seal prop to the coast of California, I was shocked to see them lying through their teeth about great whites breaching there. Not only did they use footage from South Africa, you can clearly see that the seal is not a prop but a living seal. The female photographer claims to have gotten a shot and they show you NOTHING. Just hash over the Californian attempt! I couldn't believe the poor editing attempt."
5,Response to the UK viewer,I suggest you change your DVD player -- there are many on the market which are cheap and are region free. I continually send DVD's to my sister in the UK from the states and she really has no problem.
5,"Air Jaws I & II is Awesome, The Shipping and Handling By The Seller BLANKING SUCKS!","Air Jaws I & II is Awesome, The Shipping and Handling By The Seller BLANKING SUCKS!Air Jaws I & II is most awesome animal footage today, enough said! GREAT WHITES ARE THE GREATEST ANIMALS EVER!HOWEVER, HURRICANE AND ALL THE PRODUCT SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED BY NOW! HECK< I PAID HIGH PRICE FOR THE S&H;, IN THE FIRST-PLACE! THE COST FOR THE S&H; WAS WAY TOO HIGH!"
1,"Small, lightweight junk","I was surprised this was so light weight. You have to cut your veggies less than 3"" to fit into the space. Then you have to put pressure on the center of the turning handle with one hand while you turn with the other in order to create even, unbroken strips. And while you are using 2 hands to do this - this lightweight piece of junk feels like it is about to topple over. Way too cheaply made for the cost!I would return this total piece of junk but I'd have to pay for shipping back to Kitron and 20% restocking fee (not shipped to Amazon, shipped to Kitron). Adding into that the cost of shipping to me, I decided to cut my losses and keep it.Sheesh, do I feel like an idiot for buying it."
3,Disappointed with the Benriner Spiral Slicer,"I am disappointed with the Benriner Spiral Slicer and wished that I went with a less expensive spiralizer. I have used this item on zucchini so I could make ""spaghetti"" to go with a raw sun-dried tomato sauce. It took many tries to get the ""noodles"" to come out the way I expected and then the strips were shorter than I wanted it. The product is light and one has to cut the veggies small and then put much pressure to make this work. If something happened to this spiral slicer tomorrow, I would NOT replace it with the same item. I will continue to use the product and if I have a change of heart on this item, I will update the notes."
2,Disappointed,"For the amount of money that this item costed I was very very disappointed. I expected a very good quality slicer, it was light weight plastic. Looks like a cheap kitchen tool that I could have bought in china for less than $5.00."
5,Value- Four different cuts!,"I was searching for a spirilizer for my new raw food diet for weeks. I planned on using the Benriner to substitute all of our pasta with veggie noodles. I liked the idea that I could make angel hair, spaghetti and linguini size noodles all from the same cutter. When you remove the blades there is still one blade left over that makes curly cuts. I think the curly cuts will be perfect for making veggie chips in my Weston vegikiln 10 tray food dehydrator (also an excellent value). Don't be put off by the machine being plastic. It seems strong- even when using your weight to push down on the veggie. The blades are good quality and very sharp. I recommend that you watch some youtube videos before buying your veggies or using the machine so you don't make some of the common first use mistakes. Healthy eating with your new veggie noodle maker!"
1,Now available on DVD - and not worth it,"Considering the historical and musical importance and legacy of Les Paul, this film is dire. He spends most of the time acting as compere - and pretending to fend off embarrassing plaudits. Les does play a few pieces - but none are all that great and the first few minutes are so dark you can hardly see anything. His guests are good - I'm not saying they aren't - and Gilmour's solo is superb. But if you're hoping to see Les Paul playing.....forget it.Over the years I've seen hours of film of him playing - so where has it all gone to? None of it turned up here.If you want to see gushing, back-slapping by the bucketful, then buy this. If you want to see a master in action - then steer well clear.Considering the amount of film featuring Chet Atkins (and many other great guitarists) that is being released on VHS and DVD, surely there must be a similar amount featuring Les Paul?Sorry - but I think this film is a travesty and an insult to a truly great man."
3,Worth the Money,"After finally purchasing a video of my favorite jazz group I was satisfied...and yet disappointed. The group performed as well as ever but the quality of sound was so bad...but then it was forty years ago!!! Both Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond play interesting solos - Paul especially is excellent on Take Five and Dave gets in to some typical time changes in Its A Raggy Waltz. Didn't care at all for Ralph Gleason and was pleased he didn't waste any more interviewing. Poor Dave Brubeck seemed strained, or nervous, as he introduced the various pieces by the group. But I would pay the money again to watch the group that has given so many hours of pleasure over the past five decades."
4,Helpful for all Populations,"Water Fitness After 40I am a water fitness professional and I swear by Ruth Sova's books. Water Fitness After Forty keys on exercises to especially benefit people with age-related, health and flexibility issues (special population groups) but are suitable and equally challenging for very fit exercisers. Ms. Sova shows helpful moves that do not compromise or contra-indicate joints and muscless yet still provide a health-giving, vigorous workout. Students can key each exercise to his or her particular needs and/or range of motion limitations. Also, the book works as a stand-alone guide for exercising without the benefit of an instructor. A great asset to anyone who desires to stay fit in the aqua aerobic environment."
2,Not for the neophyte!,"I'm sure the exercises in this book are fine, but I can't remember them long enough to use them in a pool. This book is useful only for those who can record the instructions and play them back when they are in the pool, or for an instructor who can use it to lead a water aerobics class. I can't judge the efficacy of the exercises but they seem OK-- when I read them. This is a waste for people like me.."
2,You get what you pay for,"You can't beat the price, but after only one month I can only get this battery to charge to about 68%. It serves it's purpose for an old laptop, but don't expect it to hold the charge of the better batteries."
5,Good product,"After 6 or so months of use this battery keeps on working as advertized, am happy with it."
1,Eh. . .,"The description for the program was more hype than anything. There wasn't as much interaction ivolved with problems as it's made out to be. I remember back in the 90's there were some good programs that let you do the bulk of the problem on within the program and it even gave you tests and spit out some stats. There was more reading than anything, I felt. After an hour, I uninstalled. Didn't really feel this product was for me. On the other hand, I gave the program to a friend and he loves it. I would download a trial version if it was available, then go from there."
2,Not what we had hoped for,"I ordered this for my middle school kids to get a good start on pre-algebra and algebra this summer. They both complain about how boring it is, and it is a fight to get them to use it. According to my kids, most of it is just text with a few short quizzes here and there. Why isn't there a Reader Rabbit Algebra!?"
2,Not exactly as the same as TV game!,"I purchased two of these hand held Deal or No Deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys. The boys found that they had trouble indicating that they'd like to ""Take the Deal"". When the pressed the button to say ""Yes"" to the deal, the game continued as if they said ""No Deal"". They got annoyed, but kept on playing. I tried the game, thinking that they did something wrong, but I also had the same problem. I'm annoyed because the game was $20 each and I think it doesn't work properly!"
3,Addictive.,"The handheld version of ""Deal or No Deal"" is just as addictive as the television show--though Howie is missed! I found the game easy to use and a great deal of fun! Enjoy!"
5,VW Camper Book,"Book arrived promptly and in like new condition. Nice photos of some interesting and unique British camper conversions, and a collection of VW camper advertising from the 60s forward. This book is currently on our coffee table, and I read through different chapters when I can."
2,VW Camper,"I bought this book as a gift... When I received the box and opened it, everything looked like is was just thrown in... This books cover was all torn and wrinkled. I was very upset but kept the book because of the time. I tried to fix it best as I could. From now on please be careful how you put the books in a box, when sending other things with them.. My son really wanted this book and I had to give it to him this way..."
4,It's Compact; It Works.,"I am sure glad this charger works. It is more compact than the original Casio charger, which makes packing for my upcoming trips easier. Very pleased with it. I have only used it once so not sure how long my battery life will be yet."
2,Works with adaptation,"My husband had to do some physical adjusting to the CANP40 mini battery charger before I could use it. He cut away one of the raised side as the NP-40 battery could not be used as it could not make connection to charge. Even with the side cut away, I need to secure the battery to the charger with an elastic band for it to work."
5,good and cheap,"does exactly what you need, if you forget it in the hotel room, no worries, there's more available at amazon. It saves space when traveling, no need to bring the cradle when you have this."
4,Good Camcorder.,"I got this over 2 weeks ago. The quality of the digital video image is good when recoding in standard recording (not EP).The book that comes with the Camera is extremely poorly written. I had some difficulty figuring out how to finalize a DVD, the main thing is that the Camera should be connected to the power, it would not finalize while on battery, DVD -R cannot be un-finalized.Editing VOB files requires additional software. On the other hand you can play without any problem your video straight out of the finalized mini DVD-R on any DVD player, including your computer DVD device."
2,"Decent camera, weak computer integration","If you want a simple way to take decent video and burn it onto a DVD with basically no editing, this is a good choice. If you want to take that video and put it on your computer, this thing is terrible. It doesn't come with any video software, even though the manual has instructions for Roxio MyDVD for Canon. This software comes with a different model, and you can't buy the ""for Canon"" version separately. The regular MyDVD from Roxio costs $70, and is terrible.Overall, my old Sony miniDV tape camcorder worked better with my computer. I think the main benefit here will be to capture raw video of the kids on a little DVD, then just mail the DVD to the in-laws."
2,I wasn't too impress,"Though Canon is a great brand, I wasn't too impress with this particular camcorder. I thought it was a bit grainy...I think the picture quality could have been a little better. I actually return this product."
1,my new camcorder,"I received the product about one week after purchase. I followed the instrctions and tried to insert a DVD-RW disc for recording. Unfortunately it gave me a message: CANNOT READ THE DISC, CHECK THE DISC.I tried three other discs (Memorex miniDVD+RW, bought via Amazon at the same time as I bought this Canon DC230, but none of them worked).I need technic support ASAP. Any suggestion would be appreciated."
3,Glass sweetener jar,The lettering came off the front on the first washing. Metal top is a thin but seems to work fine.
3,A good book but dated,"Its a great introduction and we still use it as a basic reference tool, but there are more recent works on the subject....."
1,Wireless for Dummies too old.,"Publishing date was 2005. It's 2008. 'Nuf said? Got it for half price thru an Amazon vendor, but it's so old technically that its hardly worth that price."
5,Monroe plus struts,The monroe strut where perfect also was shipped very fast had they in no time put them on in no timecar rides perfect great service thanks
2,"Good writing, lousy edition","Although the work itself is magnificent, this particular edition of it is very disappointing. It looks nothing like what's pictured here (and I checked the link to make sure I ordered the right one). The one I received is an oversized purple volume. It appears that someone just xeroxed an earlier edition of the work and bound it together. Also this edition has almost no footnotes or translation, and some of the medieval text is a bit difficult to understand. I'd recommend the penguin edition."
2,returned,"I'm sure these are a great product, my dog just didn't like them. He wouldn't hardly let me put them on, so I knew he would never tolerate hem for any length of time."
4,Great product except.,Product works great. Stays on valve stems effortlesly.Only problem the straight front end would not work on 98 Ford RV front wheels. I am changing the tip to a angle end.
5,Very nice.,"This product, like many people have experienced, is very well made, and great to have around, and many are working at 30 years of age. I have no real complaints about the quality of this product for my primary use, which is speedily checking the pressure and airing up the tires for my trucks, trailers, daily drivers. The only flaw with my gauge, which doesn't bother me, is it tends to read about three pounds high, which I just started mentally compensating for. For stuff I am concerned with getting very accurate, or low pressure readings, (motorcycle, ATV, drag slicks, high performance radials) I still use a quality gauge to check the pressures anyway."
3,Mutant Bats on the Rampage,"A professor at a college in a small town is working with bats. He has bred them to be stronger and meaner. Then they get out and kill him. A local cop, once of the LAPD, and the local vet/animal control officer, worry about the loose bats and soon have their fears confirmed as the bats begin to attack others.The hunt for the bats goes on while the body count rises. The town's apple festival is in jeopardy but it won't be shut down because of the necessary income it brings in. But our heroes start to notice a pattern in the attacks and learn more about how to disrupt or scare bats. In the end, we learn the truth of what is going on and see the final stand between heroes and bats.A pretty typical story that follows the Jaws formula but adds a new twist on the animals' behavior. This is not just nature lashing out. Animal attacks, politics, and greed all come together in this story. Check it out."
4,Death By Flappy Wings And Bitey Teeth...,"FANGS is a pretty good little mutant-bats-attack movie. The tiny town of Scottsville is besieged by the fuzzy flappers, much to the chagrin of Mr. Hart (Corbin Bernsen from The Dentist 1 and 2), who sees the onslaught as a severe setback for his real estate empire. Whip Hubley is the local veterinarian, and Tracy Nelson plays the cop. Together, they attempt to deduce what is behind a string of grisly deaths. I like this hokey hunk of cheezy goo! Even w/ no nudity, only slight violence, and nary a cuss-word, FANGS manages to be entertaining. And the CGI bats are fairly life-like! FANGS even has Dennis Fimple (Creature Of Black Lake) as a farmer! If that's not enough, there's a twist ending to boot! Enjoy..."
4,Think of it as a Monster Vampire Movie Trailer,"This is a fairly standard but quite entertaining collection of clip catalouging but a small fraction of al the Dracula/Vampire movies that have been spawned by Hollywood in the last hundred years. There is no attempt to get into deep meaning or to really differentiate between the variant styles employed in such films, but you will recognize all of your favorites and probably come up with a few new flicks to track down at your local video store."
3,Somewhat disappointing to a horror fan,"I was disappointed with this movie. I expected it to make me jump at least once. It did not. The best thing going for it is a funky kind of comedy. It is definitely not a movie that I would want to watch again and again, although I did enjoy it the first time. I would advise you to rent it before buying a copy. Once you see it, you may well decide that it is not a ""keeper."""
5,great,"this is a great piece of work once again from damon albarn. constantly experimenting with different styles and working well with a various amount of different musicians, it truly shows that he is indeed one of the most innovative musicians out there today. of course this is only one song off the album, but from the live shows alone, you can already figure out that damon knows what he's doing with this project. it won't disappoint, a great single from what will most definitely be a fantastic album."
3,A good work out but NOT traditionally yoga,"This is not a typical yoga workout. It is very high paced and challenging. In fact I'm not sure what it is ""Integrated"" with.This is a good work out, but it is not separated into clear cut sections so that you can do twenty to forty minutes at a time. It all runs together. I was energized afterwards and my muscles had been worked.If you're looking for Jennifer Kries she is not in the video at all, just some other girl with too much hair spray."
2,"Really 2.5 stars, but no option","I own at least 50 DVD's and exercise at home 6 days a week, doing a yoga or Tai Chi workout daily. This workout was like a ""Jack of all Trades"" and didn't master anything, so I was left feeling like I had to exercise again. I did not like the flowing yoga as the first two times the instructor went through, it was extremly fast and so I had to stand a watch...I personally don't like that. I don't have to be able to complete a DVD the first time, but it should not be so complicated that you actually stop moving."
1,Too much of a traditional workout,"I started doing yoga for the stretching and toning, but also for the serenity. I find many workout videos grating because of the amount of pep talk by the instructor, and this one falls into the same category. The overly peppy ""It's left, and it's right and it's a stretch."" What is this ""it"" they keep saying anyway? If you go for that high energy, high motivation type of workout, then this is good. Otherwise, forget it."
4,Very good,I have the greatest respect for Jennifer Gries' Pilates/Yoga Series.She is my original teacher for Pilates. Very professional!
3,Not Jennifer Kries,"I typically like Jennifer Kries videos and would have probably purchased this one. Fortunately, in a fitness video catalog, I read that neither of the two workouts is led by Jennifer Kries (who is pictured on the cover). It may be a good video, but don't expect Jennifer Kries. Try Precision Yoga if you want Jennifer Kries as a yoga instructor."
1,"Bad, bad, way bad!","It is not often that I give up on a book without finishing it -- but with this book I had to. Too many details, unbecomming characters, full of typos, and nothing that really sets the hook. Having read quite a bit in the chicklit genre -- this should not be included in the same classification. Yes, the main character is a woman. Yes, she is 20 or 30-something. But the similarity stops there. Don't bother with this one ladies. It left me frustrated and needing to find a good book quickly to make up for lost time spent with this one."
2,Ugh...really bad...,"A Year of Samantha sounded good...I'll at least give it that. I thought it sounded like an interesting read, considering it gave the view of a man and not just the woman, for a change (at least in chick-lit).Oh boy was I wrong. I ended up skimming the last half just to find out what happened. This book drags, and drags, and drags some more. It's filled with spelling and grammar errors. Samantha is such a stupid character...I just wanted to shoot her to get her to make up her mind. Then of course there's Cedric...who I believe is either too dumb or too afraid to just give Samantha up. The ending is predictable and took too long to come about.If you're looking for a long book that doesn't take much effort to read, by all means, grab this one. It's good for a beach day or some other time when you have a lot of time to sit around and read without putting much thought into it. Other than that though, this one isn't too entertaining. There's much better out there..."
5,A fun read.,"I enjoyed A Year of Samantha. It is fun and pleasant. I would certainly suggest it to anyone who, like me, enjoys books by Jane Green & Sophie Kinsella."
1,Possibly one of the WORST books I've read,"This book was absolutely terrible. The writing was stilted and not at all engaging. The characters were poorly developed and alternately pathetic and spineless and a heartless self-involved loser of a ""heroine"". Just awful-don't waste your time or money on this book."
2,I didn't like it,"The author sent me this book, and that was very nice. It sounded like it would be really good and I was really looking forward to reading it. It bored me to tears. The book was two thirds of Sam trying to get her money back. And the Cedric character was pathetic. I couldn't wait for it to end. A lot of parts seemed to drag. But the parts I wanted to go on longer ended very quick. Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,Fun,"The author of this book emailed me to see if I would add this book to one of my listmania lists. This is really strange for me since I am only 17, but not the first time this has happened.This book sounds like a Wendy Holden book and one I would like to read."
5,Captivating!,"Sam - you go girl! This is not your ordinary romance novel! The main character, Samantha, has beauty, strength, spirit, and is not afraid to go after what she wants. A refreshing change from the typical, predictable, and boring novels of late. B.D. Gardner brings Samantha alive and makes you care about hat is going to happen next in her life. I read the entire book in two days and can't wait for the next one! Bravo!!"
1,Unreadable,"I am so glad that I bought this book used because if I'd spent $25 on it I'd be sick.It was awful... the writing, the story, the characters, the typos, everything... Just truly awful!I've read great chic lit, good chic lit, and ok chic lit.This however, was unreadable chic lit and I had to give up the book after trudging my way through the first 4 chapters.Don't waste your money )o: Sorry..."
2,Great Myth Builder,"As a combat veteran, I found this book to be the quintessential volume of compiled propaganda and myth perpetuating photos taken out of context and thrown together to form a body of misinformation that seems to further the personal opinions of a preconceived ideal. Through the efforts of presenting gloomy photographic technique and editorial deceit, the authors have formed the same old stereotypical crap that shows everything about the Vietnam experience to be mired in slime and couched in decadence. It was definitely not my VN experience or others I've known. But this book is a slick portrayal, as well as a betrayal to all of us who were really there. Any war is not pretty, but nowhere in this book is the awesome beauty of the people or country displayed..Here it is just a prefabricated Bummer."
2,"Great photos, biased text","I'm a Vietnam veteran and I read this book many years ago - I hadn't thought of it in years, but it occurred to me recently to take another look. Yes, Mr. Griffiths is a very good photographer, but his text was far too biased. I'm not saying everything he said was wrong - yes, there was plenty of American stupidity in Vietnam - there's plenty of stupidity and cruelty in all wars - and yes, there were American atrocities in Vietnam. But the text is so biased and one-sided that it obscures the complex reality of the war. Not all Americans in Vietnam were blundering, heartless idiots; not all Vietnamese hated all Americans; and the communists were not all innocent peasants - some were vicious murderers. This book would have been far better with more balance."
5,Great Pictures,"Great photos by a great human being, who, sadly, left us last year.Shows the horrible human suffering that war causes, as well as the beauty and resilience of the human spirit.One photograph was especially telling. It shows a bunch of women and one man standing knee deep in swamp water, their faces covered with surgical masks, covered by an impromptu surgery tent, awaiting the next patient, who is arriving on a stretcher. Picture was taken in the U Minh Forest, September 15, 1970."
5,Dust is great,"This seller is perfect, high quality merchandise shipped very quickly & package professionally. Will always buy from this seller. My chinchillas love this dust. Thank you"
2,A CD that sounds like an old record,"A word of warning. This is a mono recording of truly dreadful quality. As the overture began, I thouhgt I was listening to an old amd much-used LP (how, I wonder was the transfer done? ) The two stars I have it reflects ONLY the historic value of hearing some good voices."
4,An Excellent Introduction,"This is an excellent textbook for an introductory course in early church history. This first as well as its companion second volume in the excellent Monarch (or Baker) History of the Church series gives a scholarly overview based on the most recent research in the field. It's good also to see an author from the southern hemisphere in this series, Ivor Davidson from the University of Otago, in Aotearo/New Zealand."
3,OK,The book is informative. It is not well written. Some of the chapters are a chore to get through.
4,/,a definite and pertinient source for the marginalized believers of the early church in that records are not maintained of the poor and uneducated believers....
4,Excellent golf set,"I am new to golf, i have played only twice , experience so far has been great . This is a great starter kit, has all the golf clubs you need, also comes with a hybrid , which is hard to find ( that is what my pro friend tell me , lol ) i recommend this set of clubs, bag alone is worth the price!."
4,Best I've Tried!!,"I just got my bra and tried it on right away. Wow! Very nice indeed. I wish I had heeded the advice of others and ordered a size up though. I am usually a 34D but in this garment I could use a DD. However, I have no qualms because I did the jump test (yes, I jumped lol) and this bra did not slide down one bit!!! Yes, I could definitely use more coverage on the top of my cup but for some purposes it is better that it fits more snuggly than loosely. Also, the fact that my cup runneth over allows me more cleavage to work with lol As long as these babies are pushed up and stay up, I'm good! I am still definitely going to order this in a DD because I would like to have more than one of these bras for sure!"
3,"good product, horrible fit","i ordered this bra because the reviews made it sound like it was exactly what i needed. when i got it i was very disappointed though. the bra was a horrible fit. ordered my usual size of 32DD. the bust band seemed to fit great - nice and snug. but the cups were way too large. in that i mean they came up too high into my underarms, not necessarily that i couldn't fill them. maybe just not the right bra for a little frame. also, not a push-up."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I was very disappointed in the bra. I have purchased a few bras in this price range at various stores and this bra is no where near those others I have purchased. This bra was awful, the sizing was way off (I purchased my normal size that I have been for some time) it was definitely off. The material was just awful...not soft or smooth at all. Very cheap feeling. I immediately contacted the seller to inform them I would be returning the product, no one asked why or if they could help with the issue, etc. Do not waste your money on this bra, truly was terrible. In this price range, I expected much more and for it to be similar to my other bras. It was not at all"
3,Not worth the price!,"The material of this bra just felt very cheap to me and the bra fit poorly and was uncomfortable... Definitely not worth the hefty price. I really wanted it to work, but it just didn't. 3 stars for the excellent customer service and quick response in regards to getting my return completed. I found a much better supportive bra in Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless!"
4,A Horrifying Experience,"Our class is doing a book report project and for my book I read, House of Horrors: Aunt Weird, issue #4 by Lloyd Alan. I thought this book was a good book because you could tell when a scary part was coming up next. This story is about two kids whose parents went out of town and left them with their strange Aunt Wendy. After weird things start to happen, they give Wendy a nickname, Aunt Weird. Small things start to happen around this old, dark house, but the real terror starts when Aunt Weird takes off her head! I recommend this book for anyone who likes adventure/horror. That is why I gave it four stars."
3,This book was just a so-so book.,"This was definitly not one of R.L. Stine's greatest books he's ever written. I stopped reading his books a couple of years ago, because they always have the same plot twist. I decided to try one of his newest books, and I did. I knew right away who it would be. It's always the person you should least expect. R.L. Stine should give so much evidence on one person, who'd think it couldn't be that person, and that it really would be that person. Like I said, this book was just so-so."
5,Dark Magic,Mia Saxton has no friends at her new school. She is thrilled when a few people come to her and invite her to their group. Mia enjoys the group until their practices become more and more dangerous.
4,Startling.,"This story is startling. It does what Allen Say sets out todo, it alters you. No one writes about this stuff - age-ism -especially not in a children's book and through the powerful medium ofa hallucinatory/fantastic story sequence. It's definitely different and I almost want to say subversive. I wonder what children would think of it."
2,i like them,"well i like, them they are very cute, but they are small on me, not in the shoe size but in the zipper area, i cant zip them, and i would return them to you back but the shipping is kinda cost alot so they just laying in a closet, so you rate the item"
3,almost,So only 1 more Volume until they decide to release the season. I'm not buying the volumes because it's a rip off. Wait til they release the whole season 1.
1,Sad state of WB and the animation fan,"I keep waiting and waiting for season sets to so many shows, Batman Brave and Bold, Smurfs, this new Scooby. Heck even Falcon Crest I bought day one and suddenly the second season is $50 with a terrible transfer from site only. I remember fans being leery of buying more smurf sets after it was announced there weren't going to be season sets. Sure enough after the first release sales dropped 70 percent. Maybe its time for WB forget joe six pack $10 impulse buyer and treat these properties with respect."
2,Others are much better,"My 17-month-old daughter loves Teletubbies. Her favorite DVD is ""Here Come the Teletubbies"" which features many interesting scenes with children. Notably, a beach scene with a little white dog and a beach ball. She stands riveted during this scene. She also loves the segment where chicldren in school put on their raincoats and go outside to play in the rain.Bluesky has proven to be a disappointment. The scenes are almost psychedelic-- with bright, graphically designed balls repeatedly bouncing across the screen. She loses interest quickly. I find it a bit disturbing, personally. I know this is all subjective, and I'm sure there are babies out there that like this DVD-- but perhaps they are much younger."
3,The Older Style format,"I love all Teletubbies, but apparently, as with all products, improvements are made over time. This DVD is from one of the older shows. It's still a good dvd, but I prefer the newer versions."
3,Okay,"These are okay, but cheaply made. I had to bend mine a little to actually make them circles. They aren't solidly soldered or attached from top to bottom, there is a pretty big gap on both ends where the sides were stuck together. They are pretty sturdy, but not really anything to write home about."
1,It ain't the Odessa File,"Frederick Forsyth is probably not quaking in his boots after this book came out, and I can see why. Unlike the Odessa File, this novel has no chance of winning the Edgar Award. This book is very stacatto, as if it were thought out as it was written. Mr. Flannery should take a hint from Mr. Forsyth, who uses extensive outlines before he writes. There is no subplot of any kind connecting the various incidents in this novel, and when the President is about to be killed, you wish they'd go ahead and get it over with. It's a shame Mr. Forsyth retired. I wish we had more thriller writers like him."
2,Not enough detail,"This book read as if the author was in a hurry to complete a full novel in record time. Although the basic concepts were interesting, not enough detail was included, characters were hard to identify with, and the ending was rushed. This is not, however, reflective of the author's other works, which I have thoroughly enjoyed reading."
5,Returning to a Better Way,"This book by George Oliver returns the reader to a time and methodology where people took responsibility for what they did and what they produced. In this world of spiraling food prices, huge landfills, diminishing food supplies, loss of topsoil, and water pollution, the reader is gently chastised for ""letting someone else do it"" and being ""just too busy."" We were once a self-reliant nation; now we outsource.Oliver shows the reader what is wrong and where it is. You would be well advised to read the book over and over until you recognize the problems in our living world and how things can be turned around."
4,Interesting Overview of the Western Mystery Traditions,"William Gray is a very approachable author and acccomplishes a lot in conveying the history and tradition of the Western Way. The challenges faced by the reader will be the general dry writing style, the dated material, and the somewhat shallow approach. On the other hand, it is a great primer for someone new to the tradition, and would be a great second or third book to read if looking to pursue this path."
5,Celebration of her life,"I bought this book because as a breast cancer survivor, I wanted to honor this woman for her bravery and most of all for her honesty in publishing photos of herself in sickness and in health. This book truly is a celebration of Lynn Kohlman's life and it contains amazing images that are the most breathtaking example of real breast cancer awareness I have ever seen. They are beautiful because Lynn Kohlman was beautiful. Once you have seen them, you will never again look at a frilly pepto pink image and think it even remotely relates to breast cancer awareness. It's time people began seeing honest images of real women and their real outcomes after breast cancer. Because we will never conquer this disease until we all face the truth about what it does to one in eight women, if you can handle the truth, start with this book. Then move on to The Scar Project. If you can't handle the truth, you can find plenty of pretty pink images at Susan G. Komen and The American Cancer Society."
2,Lynn Front to Back,"The true story of a self-described ""bookworm"" who makes it big in the world of fashion modeling in the 1970s.A true individualist, Lynn became a cultural icon and a muse for several top designers,including Donna Karan, Perry Ellis and Tommy Hilfiger. A story of great courage as she fights cancerand learns to live with surgical disfigurement. Very inspiring."
3,america's cheesehead!!,"the dvd is dedicated to the fantastic 2010 season of packers, through the story of 3 characters, mike mc carthy,aaaron rodgers and charles woodson.the duration is 45 minutes of footage and reports. the extras are quite boring to be honest, 30 minute monologues of the 3 main characters, then there are, thankfully, the ring ceremony and other extra about the many players who are injured in the 2010 season. i'm a packers'fan and i must say that i prefer, by far,the previous dvd""superbowl XLV-packers"""
4,"An excellent book, but needs an update","This book has fantastic pictures and a great view on Paul McCartney's life since his childhood in Liverpool, as a member of The Beatles, his marriage to Linda Eastman, his family life, and the birth and rise of his group Wings. However, it only shows information up to 1975, so it needs to be updated. But it's indeed a treasure for any McCartney fan, with dozens of rare and private photos."
5,Every center striving to improve needs this information!,"Every call center supervisor, manager, and senior exec wants to know what other centers do. This report will help you answer those questions - for a relatively low cost, and without having to spend lots of time. And it doesn't just spew suspect statistics - rather, it talks about what works, what doesn't work, and what people are planning for as their next steps. It goes a step further in providing you with models to think about for things like roles and responsibilities, improvement cycles, and quality monitoring scorecards. As a consultant, writer, speaker, and teacher focused on call centers, I recommend this report to anyone asking me for information on what other centers do or where they're heading."
2,"Somewhat useful, but far from comprehensive","After hearing many people tell me how great this book was I finally bought it. While it has been somewhat useful in finding the readings for some names, it is far from being ""A Comprehensive Index"" of Japanese names. Less than half of the names I try to look up in it are even listed, and the way the kanji are indexed is not intuitive (even to someone familiar with radicals and stroke-count indices).I would only recommend this to someone who doesn't have access to a real name dictionary from Japan, but don't count on it to be ""comprehensive"" in any sense of the word. It's not even close."
1,Never received my order,"Never got the chance to enjoy my book, for the reason I never received my order. It was b/o from day 1 and months later still b/o. so I canceled it. now my child is due in March/April and I have to scramble to find a book so that I may choose a name from....Not happy."
2,Glad I bought the used version,"I would have been irritated if I had paid full price for this one. It's an okay read, but very contradictory and over-simplified. Just so you know before you read it: Don't fall for the ""this isn't a diet"" part. By the end you will realize that for all the talk about diets not working she is saying to eat a low fat diet, no sweets, etc. which I consider to be a diet. Eat fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats. Same information but with a lot of arrogant generalizations thrown in. It is also very out of date so I'm surprised that the price is kind of high. I bought used because I saw that it was from the 90's. I'm glad I did."
1,How to stay fat forever!,"All the scientific- sounding descriptions (feast, famine, feast-famine cycle, etc.) are really just terms the author has come up with to support her opinion on what she feels should be done to become ""naturally"" thin. This book is strictly based on the author's own experience and a few of her case studies.I think it's interesting to note that in the entire book, there is not a single work cited. No journal articles, research, or scientific studies are listed anywhere to support the author's viewpoint. No bibliography at the end of the book for further information on the subjects the author described.Because of this, I think this method should be approached with a grain of salt. I personally would run as fast as I could in the opposite direction from a plan that tells me that I have to gain weight first in order to lose weight."
5,Exciting Find,What an exciting find! I've looked for this book of and on for years. It's a classic.The book arrived quickly and was in excellent shape. Very pleased with the book andthe service.
3,baby's toys,Our daughter really likes the toys. The pyramid and block have bells inside them. The ball has a crumple sound.
1,A drama and nothing more,"I bought this movie for its historic value. Practically no film exists that covers Cuba during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Although I knew this was a US interpretation of the period and that it was made in the 1950s, I had hoped for some nod to the Cuban revolution of 1933. In fact, it is an overly dramatic love story of revolutionaries fighting for some undefined revolution who dig a tunnel from the home of an innocent and beautiful orphaned young woman. The rest is entirely predictable. She falls in love with one of the ardent young insurrectionists who is killed. Cuba is only some exotic backdrop for the age-old story of youthful promise and sacrifice. For today's taste, the acting is blatant, overdrawn, sappy, and predictable."
3,Worst of the 5.,"I just finished reading the last book of this series. I'm happy with the series as a whole, Earthborn was a bit disappointing for me. This book takes places many generations after the original Nafari and Elemeki. So, only Shedemai and the Oversoul are returning characters.There are many questions spawned from the first books that are never answered. Especially the BIG one, which if you've read the first four, you'd understand. As with the first four books, character development is good and you quickly take sides on who you like and who you don't.Overall, not a bad book, but not strong in comparison to the others."
2,Liked the Homecoming Series? You Don't Need This...,"Personally, I don't feel this novel adds to the Homecoming series as a whole. The only character carried over from the original ""cast"" is Shedemei, and the other characters are too numerous and distant to give you any real connection to them. The same with the events... I just really had trouble caring because I was thrust into them without bothering to fully grasp where I was in this setting.I think that if you've read the rest of the Homecoming series and are considering whether or not to read this in addition, I wouldn't bother. I know it's tempting to find out what else happens, but it really isn't all that amazing, and doesn't actually contribute to the plot behind it.As for the religious overtones, I actually found myself bored with portions of the novel. I even went as far as to skip reading a few areas, which I hardly EVER do with novels.My advice: Don't bother with this one."
2,What's the problem with the Spanish edition????,"ComprÃ© el primer libro de la saga en EspaÃ±a y realmente me encantÃ³. Por eso, cuando llegue a Argentina (donde vivo) me comprÃ© el 2do, 3ro y 4to. Tuve muchÃ­simos problemas para encontrar la ediciÃ³n en espaÃ±ol del 5to, de hecho, NO LA ENCONTRE. QuÃ© pasa con las personas que no saben inglÃ©s? Se quedan sin el final de la historia? Me parece que tendrÃ­an que solucionar ese problemilla. Igualmente, los felicito por los otros cuatro!"
4,Good book but disappointing: missed the old characters,"This is really a great book as far as the storyline goes, but I was hoping to get more of the old characters. While they were talked about as legends and heroes, I really wanted to see what actually happened to them. Specifically, I was expecting to learn about the war between Nafari and the Elemaki.I can't really complain too much though because I really did enjoy this book, including the new characters."
2,Shedemei's Story,"Only really it isn't. I was a bit disconcerted by the end of book 4 where he fast forwarded through human history and the Elenaki / Nafari wars but I figured he'd come back to it after all there's the Oversoul / Keeper plot to resolve.Okay so Earthborn picks up that plot 500 years on. 500 years in which slavery has grown up in a group of people who's whole point was peaceful co-existance, 500 years in which those seeking the keeper have done absolutely nothing to find him.The new characters seem laboured I tried to care about them but I failed miserably I had a 1000 pages of history with the other crew now these upstarts are going to provide the solution to Volemaks quest. I feel vaguely cheated.There's really no need to buy this book as for all real purposes the story finished in the end of Earthfall, that wasn't because the story had been told it was because that's where Card finished it. This is the start of a new series not the conclusion of the old one"
3,A disappointing ending to a riveting series,"I was disappointed by Earthborn. Yes, it has the grand sweep, the fascinating characters, the Search for The Meaning of Life. But as I was reading it I got the sense more and more that I was being preached to, that Card was trying to fashion a sci-fi New Testament. Now, I agree with a lot of his messages: the destructive competitiveness of men, the power of bonds of family and friendship, things that are worth striving for (honor, honesty), etc. But ultimately the story falls flat because of the deus ex machina ending; the principal antagonists (Akma, Mon, Aronha) do not ""find the light"" in their own world, in their own way. Instead, it is kicked in their teeth by The Keeper that they were wrong. And that flies in the face of what Card is preaching: that we need to achieve goodness through free will."
5,Card's books offer a new view of literary characters,"Card's Earthborn is a masterpiece that illustrates to everyreader the idea that all human are imperfect. The charactersare all human and none are completely perfect, or completelyevil, allowing the reader to see heros and enemies that moreclosely reflect the adventures that we face everyday."
1,Not Part Of The Home Coming Series,"The Homecoming series should have stopped after Earth Fall. This book takes place many many years after the end of Earth Fall. None of the original characters have anything to do with this book. The characters that are in, are poorly developed. The plot is very hard to follow and what I could follow, was uninteresting. I admit, that I did not finish this book. It was just to bad to keep reading. However, it may have had an excellent ending but I doubt it. The first four books of this series were some of the best that I have ever been blessed enough to read. However this book is not included in that list. I am typically a huge Orson Card fan, but he disappointed me with this book. I do think that if you were a die hard fan of the Home Coming series, you should at least attempt this book. It may be good to you. However, do not be shocked when it turns out to be horrible."
3,in the middle,"Books in the Longarm series are usually either very good or very bad. Occasionally I come across one in the middle. Longarm books are written by many different people and all of the books are attributed to a presumably non-existent person named Tabor Evans. Because some of the Longarm authors write like eighth graders, its dangerous to buy a Longarm without first reading a review by a trustworthy reviewer. The author of Mountain Bandit is a good author. If he or she had been allowed to create a new hero, I believe the book would have been very enjoyable. Unfortunately, to those few of us who read all of the good Longarm books, the Longarm of Mountain Bandit does not quite match our image of the ""real"" Longarm. You might give this four stars if you have not been exposed to the best of the Longarm books."
5,To reshape your body this is the book!,"I have been using this exercise program for 2-1/2 months now and have really seen results. No other program I have tried has worked like this one. I have dropped one size in slacks so far and everything is firming up!! In two months!! If you want to firm up, reshape your bod, and just plain look good Joyce's workout is for you! Try it! Cheri - Michigan"
5,Great starting point,I really like this book. It was easy to get into a workout routine with relatively little soreness and surprisingly quick results. Dr. Vedral starts you off slowly and builds you up in what was a very safe and pleasant experience for me. I used this only for the weight training and did not use her dietary suggestions. Changed the shape of my body very quickly without a lot of fancy equipment or time.
2,"May be helpful for older women, otherwise not useful","If you manage not to get distracted by the sheer number of her photos, many of which are quite unnecessary, you MAY actually do some of her exercises and find this book useful. However, I couldn't help but get distracted by her narcissistic view of herself and the redundancy of many of the exercises that she presents.This is not for anyone who is past the couch-potato stage of fitness. I purchased this book hoping that I would find good exercises that women could do anywhere, especially when traveling and not having access to a gym. But these exercises haven't helped me at all. I've been better off doing push-ups, crunches, jumping jacks, and dips. For anyone who is a true couch-potato and does not exercise at all, however, this may be truly helpful.For anyone with a moderate to active lifestyle, I'd recommend purchasing the Body Sculpting Bible. I've kept that book for myself and I gave this book to my grandmother."
5,Results after only one week!,"That's right! I started the program on a Friday. It is now 10 days later which includes the suggested 2-day resting period and I feel on top of the world! I definitely have increased stamina, less of an appetite, a noticeable difference in my calfs and overall strength. I'm not depressed like I had been, my posture is better already, and my self esteem is sky high! (Haven't you noticed?) I'm in my mid 40's and I really needed this! I'm in for the long haul! Thanks Joyce!"
4,"Good program, but a larger time commitment than stated","I like joyce's book alot. She is really positive and enthusiastic and makes me feel that I can actually do her routine. I've been following her program for about 4 months now. I haven't been able to do it four times a week, but I have averaged three times a week.The book is clearly written with photos that really help to see the exercises, however a supplemental video would help even more. I would especially like to see how she is able to perform her routine in only 20 minutes. When using the full 15 seconds of rest between exercises, it normally takes me an hour. I've even tried to go as fast as I physically could, trying to ensure that I was working the muscle and not using the momentum of the movement, but I could still only get the program down to about 35 minutes.Still, I like the book."
2,Get something that is better made,"My 8 month old has already peeled off half of the stickers.Also, it falls over too easily and is too top heavy for the cheap legs."
5,Great for Cruising Babies,"We have had the Brilliant Basics Musical Pop-tivity Table for a few months now and we love it. My son loves to stand and play with it and it keeps him occupied for much longer than the average toy. The table is stable enough for my 25 pound eight month old to pull himself up on without it tipping over. I find the music to be annoying, but the switch is hidden under the table, so we just don't turn it on. The activities on the toy keep him busy enough without the music anyway. Overall, a fantastic buy!"
4,Electric Heater,Space heater works well in our travel trailer. You can do better on price at Sams Club.
1,Not impressed!!!,"This 8 piece stainless steel set was NOT what I expected at all. I have a glass/electric stovetop and when I try to use the pans, they sit there and rattle like they have un-even bottoms. They have somewhat of a rounded bottom, so that is probably why they do not sit steady. The bigger pots are better, however, I would not recommend this set to anyone. I was ready to send it back, but did not want to spend the money on shipping to return it. They do look pretty, and seem to clean okay. The lid knobs also come loose, but you can tighten them with a screw driver. I will definitely spend more money on a better set next time."
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap prices, cheap quality, I don't think these pots lasted 6 months. They also burn easily. You really do get what you pay for with this set."
3,Disapointed!,"The handles on the lids were lose and I had to tighten them. The pans are wimpy pans, they are not heavy. Very bad quality for the price I paid of 40$. These pans are only worth 20$ if anyone would pay that much. The frying pans are bowed on the bottom and when hot you here a POP sound as it flattens out. Not a big bow but you notice it when the pan is on the burner. I washed them good before putting them away. The very first use was a frying pan to make brats, well lets say I would nor recommend these to anyone everything sticks. I am taking these and donating them to someone in need who has nothing and going to spend the money and get copper bottems like I had before. Copper bottems are better then these things. Others may like these but I wouldnt recommend them to anyone."
1,Stainless steel pots and pans,"These pots and pans are terrible. The stainless steel is thin, and the heating is uneven. I would not recommend this product."
1,"Thin, Thin, Thin!!!!!!!",Received product in great time but only to get it out of the box and feel that it was REALLY THIN!!! A disposable aluminum pan (that you get at the $1.00 store) is thicker than this set!! I was really disappointed in this product!! GREAT shipping & packing but bad product!
2,"Title should be ""Compact living... on a limitless renovation budget.""","Title should be ""Compact living... on a limitless renovation budget.""Everything is designer showroom-perfect on these pages, like an Ikea or Pottery Barn or Crate and Barrel catalog.However the spaces lack human reality, such as quirky collections or individualized space needs or child friendly design. You don't even meet the inhabitants.Yes, invest in built in cabinets and fold away stair cases if you own and have the money. Again, these options are unattainable for many struggling to pay the mortgage or are renting.A much better book is Bartolucci's ""1000 sqft or less."" That features real people with real budgets.I wanted real advice, not catalog advertisements for perfect unattainable ideal design. I was disappointed. But perhaps idealism and extravagance, not realism and cash poor budgets are what most readers want... Hence the popularity of ARchitectural Digest, and why I am so turned off by such mags."
4,very useful,"I rent my apartment, but I found many of the ideas in Compact Living to be useful. For example, instead of buying a dining room table I just use a small table and chair like on pg. 9. Such a simple idea, but I was in the mind set that a dining room table had to be of a certain size to be useful. That is what this book is good at...helping you look at your space, no matter what size it is, in new ways. When I have someone over for dinner, I improvise. I borrow another chair and small table from in my bedroom. I do agree however, that home owners will derive more benefit from this book, than those that rent.I also had not been so familiar with ""Loft Style"" before this, but now I know I like it. However, I think the tips in the book can be applied to many different styles, even though the style shown in the pictures is primarily Loft Style.Recommendation: This is a book primarily for people who live in small spaces, but I think it would also appeal to a wide range of people."
3,Too technical . . . but fares ok in designing,"Compact living reads like a college text . . . you'd rather be doing something else but know you've got to read it to pass the class. That's how I see this book. It wasn't one that grabbed my attention from the beginning (a main criteria for me with books) but sticking with it unto the 32nd page (The Living section) made it worth the purchase. It gives great information such as the use of pattern in painting - it eats up visual space quite greedily. Also, on creating space - think in threes (redecoration, reorganization, and lightning). But I would have loved to see more real-life examples, less wording and more practicality. If you're a new apartment owner, I'll recommend ""First Home with Style,"" it's perhaps the best home design book I've bought so far."
4,Lots of structural solutions,Many cool examples of small homes with sound advice on how to maximize your space--if you can make structural adjustments to your home. Almost all the rooms feature new contemporary furnishings and therefore might be better suited for people with a chunk of change to spend. Although I like this book to some extent it doesn't fit my needs as a renter.
2,Loves it at 8 months old,"At first our baby seemed to only give this passing attention, at 3-4 months old. Now at 8-9 months old, he absolutely loves it! Sometimes we have a hard time buckling him in, because he is reaching for the pictures - especially the ones of animals. Plenty of picture cards to rotate during a car trip of several hours. It's well-constructed and easy to install/use.(I wasn't able to change the star-rating but would now give it four stars.)"
3,Good in concept,"It hung perfectly on the backseat of my car, it was durable, it came with a ton of cards for the baby to look at. The only problem is that my daughter was not in the least bit interested in this thing and I ended up taking it down after a few pointless months of use."
5,"Wonderful music, lyrics and dance","I had not come across much of Astor Piazzolla's work before, so this was all the more wonderful a surprise. This exceedingly poetic, extraordinarily poignant operetta about a doomed prostitute contains a great deal of very beautiful music, and it's highlighted by the performance of some splendid tango dancers. I like the intensity of the narrator (I believe her words were originally to be spoken by a goblin); her appearance and expression, like those of the two principal singers, and the muttering chorus, accent the tone and atmosphere of the piece - a kind of brooding, occasionally ominous, but consistently lovely progression. The bandoneon, apparently key to much of Piazzolla's music, is superb, as are the other instruments; flute played by a willowy beauty, accomplished guitar, piano, violins and percussion. And I enjoyed the glamor and style of the dancers very much. Really a lovely and moving performance."
1,Awful,"Incredible bad!! The singers are the wrong ones (and not very good to be polite), the pronunciation is awful (at points it sounds more Italian than the expected Buenos Aires Spanish accent) the dancers are not very good, and there is an absolute sense the everyone on stage wants to go home as soon as possible. To make things worse, it appears that Kultur wants to hide as much as possible from this production, no date, no details, no description, nothing!! We will have to wait for a ""Real"" production of this wonderful Operita (little opera) to appear on DVD."
5,No guessing,No guessing on when it's time to water. Very helpful in keeping my indoor plants healthy. Also use it outdoors for potted plants.
1,Not what Expected,"We were looking for a complete outdoor light fixture, but we ordered the glass inserts instead. The entire light fixture was very expensive upon further review."
5,"Great (all Marais!), esp. SACD.","Sounds so great on myOPPO BDP-83 Blu-ray Disc Player with SACD, DVD-Audio, and VRS Technology"
3,Creepy,"This is an interesting, though creepy group of short stories. Each story centers around a particular woman and her issues. The issues are mostly very dark issues, which is why I use the word ""creepy"" in my review. Some of the stories very slightly intertwine which is a nice element to the book overall. Rebecca Miller also added a few nice references to the Hudson Valley, New York area (my hometown)- that was a nice find."
3,Collection of short stories with female characters,"Althought the characters were extreme, I did not really identify with any of them. The character development was interesting so that at the end of each story I found myself wondering what happens next. I think each story is an extreme example of some trait that most women have as part of their personalities. I picked Personal Velocity for our bookclub and it was a good book for discussion. I'm glad I read this book, but don't think I would run out to read Miller's next one unless I heard good things about it."
2,One good story out of seven,"The way this book began, I thought I'd really enjoy it. I was mistaken. The book contains 7 short stories about 7 different women. The first story was excellent but then it was all downhill from there. The other six stories had a 'snooty' feeling to them. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Smells like hotel soap,"I had high hopes for this, but it smells like cheap soap. And it won't go away. I cannot stand the cheap little girl feel to this attar."
4,MUSK,"I purchased three musks from Attar Bazaar; Egyptian Musk, a heady musk with leather tones; Pearl Musk, a soft musk with a difficult (for me) to discribe note; and, White Musk, a soft, delicate and not overtly floral tone which also has no powdery notes (on my skin, at least). I like all three, but I find that the White Musk is what I currantly wear most. My body chemistry changes, so sometimes, I like to mix the scents (every few weeks or so). Men and women may find one or more of these musks to their liking."
3,Refills for Litter Champ Jr.,I have 3 Little Champ Jr. systems. I do like them but I have been waiting since FEBRUARY to get my refill bags. I am now completely out of the refill bags. I have contacted customer service many times just to be told it could take 6 weeks to get them. I have been waiting 9 MONTHS! They need to take care of their customers better and get them their refills!
2,"A Good Idea, but...","This pet waste disposal system has tremendous need for improvement. The ""triple seal"" doesn't keep foul smelling odors out as well as I'd expected and the ""scented"" liners work better when accompanied by enormous amounts of Lysol. I start a new bag every other day in an attempt to keep the stench down. This disposal system while a good idea, needs improvement."
3,Sometimes Less Is More,"My first introduction to Lenine was from a video of the Brazilian Music Festival in New York. He was incredible! What a groove! In all the footage he was playing solo and singing; a unique blend of funk and samba. I was thrilled to find the CD available on Amazon and purchased it right away. But when I pressed the play button, I was disappointed. The same songs, but OVER PRODUCED! Apparently, a producer got hold of him and decided it would sell better in the U.S. if it sounded more like ""Rap and Roll""! Could it be possible for me to purchase Lenine's demo tape-without all the marketing gimmicks added?"
1,Not the Best Visor Guide,"Except for some useful tips in the first few chapters, this book offered very little that couldn't be found in the Handspring User Manual. This book was more of a marketing piece for various third party modules and software...in fact, there are more chapters devoted to the third party add-ons than the Visor PDA. This book is not worth the money. The Visor is a great PDA, unfortunately this book fell much too short in quality."
4,Reasonably Good,I liked the book but I was wondering if you could give me information on how to get my hands on a Workshop Manual for the new F4 MV Agusta Reply to me please my address is CHUCK@Craiga12.freeserve.co.uk
4,"Over cheerleading, why?","I'm very interested in this case, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of information about it, so this book is a gem if you want to know anything surrounding the case and its participants. This book is well written, and jam packed with information and history. You get a real sense of the people, the town, and the bizarre trial.The only negative thing about this book is that it was written before Wanda had her re-conviction. We now know that she was sentenced to six months in prison, something like 10 years probation and now lives in Houston. However, the book ends after the mistrial, and does not go any further. It would be great to have a book that tells you where everyone is now!"
2,Lots of words little real explanation,I understand that this topic requires a lot of explanation. This textbook although verbose didn't cover much ground after introducing the topic. Often you will have a good explanation and example and then as the problem gets more difficult steps begin to be skipped by the author making it difficult to actually learn how to master the complicated questions given by your instructor. I feel that this book needs a substantial amount of work. It may have a lot of good information but lacks the ability to convey it to the student.
3,Felder's book is definitely a better introduction...,"...but you were probably assigned this for class instead or as well, since Smith, Van Ness, and Abbott's text does cover more material than Felder and Rousseau (Fugacity, vapor-liquid equilibrium, improved gas laws/correlations, et cetera). The tables in this book are pretty good, there's a lot of information there. The main problems with this book are organization and clarity. It feels like this book was written assuming you start reading at the front towards the back, and remember EVERYTHING covered. It's a little frustrating spending 20+ minutes trying to track down the relevant information needed to frame your equations. The Peng-Robinson equation(s) are scattered over a whole chapter, for a mild example. The information is there, but finding the relevant parts while weeding out the rest without getting confused is a challenge."
3,"Decent book, there could be better ones","This book explains the basics of thermodynamics very well. However, when it comes to conceptual things like fugacity and bubble point, i feel that the book does a poor job."
2,Inaccurate description.,"The book is not NEW (with a slightly damaged front cover) and has been used extensively.The front cover along with the spine are taped where they are coming of the binding.All 8 corners of the book are torn. Finally, there are many pencil markings in every chapter(which are not a problem but should have been mentioned in the description). Overall, sinceI'm not planning to carry the book with me (and fret that it will completely fall apart),it is usable; however, I would not purchase this book had it been accurately described."
2,Not a fan...,"I feel that this book didn't take an approach that's astonishingly useful for Chemical Engineering Undergrads. The book lacked a lot of useful explanations and was heavier on theory than application. After looking at Sandler, I was fairly disappointed that this title was used for my course and not Sandler's book. Wouldn't use it to start a fire."
1,garbage,"I could have gone outside and pulled out a lump of grass by the sidewalk and had a better plant. I have bought ""Baby's Tears"" many times in plant stores and this didn't come close to what I imagined or what was in the picture."
1,"very poor, disappointing","After waiting for over two weeks for delivery of a plant this outfit claimed to have, I thenreceived the message from Amazon that the plant wasn't even available. A real bummer!"
4,Rave,This is a great product if you want to make some sweet Techno beats or just play around and have fun with it!
1,Doesn't Work,"The program will not run on Win 7. It might not even run on Win XP. I was able to install the program on Win 7, but it crashes before you can do anything. Skip it and buy their new Ejay products."
3,why why why,"I really dont know why I bought this and I really don't know why this is an uncensored version. The content was more crap from the show I didn't like and didnt show anything more useful. The show, and DVD, is still about producers taking advantage of people's worst decisions."
2,Nothing special,"I love the show Cheaters, especially the unrated versions..... But this video is nothing special. You can see better episodes on television. Save your money."
3,2nd half of Volume 1,"I thought this was the actual 2nd volume of the series, but in fact it's just Vol. 1 disc 2. Still a good disc, but I already own the Vol.1 set. So this was a waste of my money. I guess I should of researched it first."
5,"""DON'T GET CAUGHT-CHEATERS IN THE HOUSE""","I AM A BIG FAN OF CHEATERS, I TRY TO WATCH IT ON TV AS MUCH AS I CAN EVEN THOUGH THEY CUT OUT ALL OF THE GOOD PARTS, THAT WHY I START ORDERING THEM SO THAT I COULD ENJOY THEM MORE. MY HUSBAND ALSO ENJOY THE SHOW!!!!!!!!!"
1,GE DVD: Very Deceiving!,"I purchased the same model (GE1105) DVD player by General Electric. After only two months, and having used it no more than 10 times, my DVD's started skipping, until it got to the point where it just wouldn't play it anymore. My mother purchased the same exact model at the same time I did, and she herself is having problems with her GE DVD as well. I tried checking out reviews after this happened, and no reviews on GE DVDs are available. After this experience I do not recommend this GE model DVD. This is the first GE product I've purchased and the last I plan to buy from GE."
1,it is really a junk,"I bought this GE 1105p dvd player from Fry's. I did not get a chance to try this junk in the first month because my old TV just can only hooked up with a coaxial cable. I bought a big HDTV month after that and began trying this DVD player, but I was so disappointed because this player only could play some kind of DVD and I almost got it freezing and skipping in half way. The quality of picture is so terrible, it's kind of green. Can't return for a refund. Feel being cheated.I would never buy this brand ever. It's really a juuuuuuuunk. !"
3,You get what you pay for.,"In my opinion this is a midrange dvd player. I actually own the 1105P it plays all my movies and all that I have rented. I would have to say that it is very picky about the dvd disk surface. Most movies I rent need to be cleaned or the player skips or just freezes, but after I clean them they work fine. It also will not play any of my cdr's or cdrw's that I have made with movies on them."
4,Shop for your Jwin JD-VD736,"Good reviews below. My only complaint is that within the first hour I dropped mine from 1 foot to the sidewalk and the cheap plastic hinge broke the top of the clam from the bottom. The unit still works fine, but it's now in two pieces. But I liked it enough to quickly order a replacement and blame my own carelessness. But a more durable hinge would be a smarter design on their part."
2,Disappointing quality,"This compact portable DVD player sounded like just what I was looking for to listen to DVDs on my walks. But, it came with a dead battery that wouldn't recharge. jwin support sent me a preprinted list of steps to get the battery charged and eventually it would charge--but the charge would only last for half an hour. A further request for battery warranty replacement instructions was not answered. Soon, the built in speakers stopped working. In spite of all this and because of the time and postage cost of getting it replaced (if even possible), I'm going to keep and use the unit. I've made a rechargeable battery pack from 8 AA batteries and a Radio Shack holder. A plug-in speaker for $10 from WalMart takes care of the second problem."
1,problems out of the box,for starters the my shipper took for ever to send this item with excuse after excuse when it arrived i charged it for 12 hours the remote batterie did not work out of the box then when i put a new batterie in the remote the player still would not respond to it nor would the keys on the player work the screen worked for about 5 min the all i get are differnt colored lines on the screen or an all white screen one of the speakers did not work you can use the player with the av out function only but it only works for around 2 hours and then it stops playing the movie and you can hear the dvd drive spinning and something that sounds like thumping i would not recomened this player but this seems to to be something common with all jwin players
2,Lenox Holiday Glasses,"After searching the web for Christmas glasses, I located these Lenox beverage glasses. The price was reasonable and items were available immediately. My order arrived very quickly, in time for the holidays. The product was exactly as pictured. I am very satisfied and impressed with the service I received."
3,Intercessors have power,"I pulled 1 idea from the book and used it in honest prayer to God in Jesus name,I was able to ask GOD to dispatch the Arc Angel Michael to smite the driving demon off a mans neck, 7 dayslater he was found pased out in a garden complaining about a neck would, I looked at the durg addict and told him, Michael had visited him, God answers intercessors prayers,,,honestly and in LOVE only"
1,"A Laudable Project, Poorly Executed","Unfortunately, this beautifully written, morally reflective book was inadequately researched. Many of the author's anecdotes were simply culled from secondary sources (some of questionable reliability), and the book even contains lengthy sections of entirely unfootnoted assertions. Sax seems unaware of major recent work on Nazi Germany of direct relevance to the issues he addresses - Christopher Browning's ""Ordinary Men,"" Ian Kershaw's ""Hitler Myth"", Paul Weindling's ""Health, Race and German Politics"" and Kurt Schleunes', ""A Twisted Road to Auschwitz"" are all missing from his bibliography. As a result, his book unfortunately adds little to contemporary scholarly understanding of the Nazi regime, despite the novelty and importance of his initial questions."
3,Carthage and Rome,"Had finished ""The Fall of Carthage"". So I was looking for more info. on the battles between these two powers and the aftermath. I was longing for more after viewing this. Hence only three stars."
2,Great value.,"Only downside, it takes a few extra minutes of baking time due to the light color. Otherwise, just apply a little oil and it releases the baked goods better than the so called ""Nonstick"" pans that I have, for less than half the price. Hope this helps.PS: update... a couple of years later... this pan did not last long, in fact it started rusting shortly after I wrote the initial review and we had no choice but to throw it out. Consequently I am downgrading from 5 to 2 stars. Should have updated sooner, sorry..."
1,Brass polish for a tarnished image of a Hollywood broker,"McGraw-Hill should be ashamed of itself publishing this ""puff"" piece designed to convince us that Mike Ovitz is not really Sammy Glick. The book, based upon pre-approved (by Ovitz) interviews of Ovitz's friends, relatives, clients and supporters, tries to convice us that Mr. Ovitz is a misuderstood humanist and intellectual merely hidden from view by the preditor disguise he must wear to survive in the Hollywood jungle.Rubbish!"
1,A Total Waste!,"I have a problem - once I start a book, I'm compelled to finish it. I always hope that maybe with a turn-of-the-page, it'll get better. This one didn't. Robert Slater must be Ovitz's fraternal twin. Ovitz can do no wrong. Maybe someday someone will write an unbiased account."
4,A Great Read !,"I found this book chronicling Ovitz to be entertaining and informative. My favoite part is the one when Ovitz and associates leave William Morris and strike out on their own. I suppose I'm more interested in what lessons the book has to offer, as opposed to how accurate it may be. I bought several copies for friends."
2,so so,"This book is a shameless puff piece. Ovitz is just mister wonderful. What exemplifies the attitude of the author is when he lists clients who left other agents to go with Ovitz. He will name all the movies these clients did with the former agent, saying they were all flops, then name the movies these clients did with Ovitz, saying they were all hits. As though Ovitz had the magic wand. But if you are at all familiar with the movies listed, you know that a lot of the movies listed before a client went with Ovitz were HITS. And a lot of movies listed after a client went with Ovtiz were FLOPS. That's a shamelss distortion of the facts, to make Ovitz look perfect. And it's not the only distortion. Nonetheless, I'm not giving the book one star, because I did learn some stuff I wanted to know."
2,great comedy,"If any body would like a good laugh,read these books ,by Cassie Edwards.It,s absolutely unreal that anybody would get paid for writing nonsense,but if you aree looking for comedy,pick them up at a garage sale."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I found the first half of this book hard to get through. It didn't keep my interest, and I gave thought to not finishing it. About half way through it got better. I am giving the book 3 stars. I would give the first half 1 star and the second half 5 stars. The ending seemed rather rushed. I would have liked it to have wrapped up some of the stories, such as the wedding that was planned. However, it did leave me wanting a ""part 2"" covering the rest of the journey to Oklahoma."
4,Savage Joy wasn't upto the usual Cassie Edwards level.,"Cassie Edwards disapointed me with this book, it's not up to her usual standerd of writing that I am used to. The story is intreging, but at certian points it reads like a first time novelest. The story dosen't comand your attention, as does most of her other writings. Previous Cassie Edwards book that i have read have kept me wanting for more, i couldn't put them down, however i found that Savage Joy didn't have that grip, I just didn't feel pulled by the story."
3,"one of cassie,s better ones","I hate to do this because i admire anyone who can put words on paper and make them come alive.Cassie <s books most of the time are really bad.The same old plots about gorgeous Indian males panting after white women.Has anybody ever gone to a museum,and looked at these white women in the old historic photographs? These aboriginal men sure must have been desperate.I read Savage Joy because I finally found a love story between 2 Native Americans.The storyline was plausible,in away,but there is always the sense that the Indian hero is a white man underneathhis dark skin.Has anybody read Beverly Bird,s TOUCH the SUN? Stunning love story between 2 Native Americans.This book is one of cassie,s better ones but sad to say that isn,t saying too much."
1,Horrible product! Doesn't match the really nice cherry furniture!,"horrible! Customer support doesn't even even offer to help!I wish i never bought this product and got my money back!DONT BUY THISDoesn't remove the scratches or change the colour on the scratches to match the wood on the furniture, its very LIGHT not dark"
5,Perfect scratch concealer,This marker hides a scratch on wood very well as long as you choose the right shade. Once you have found the appropriate shade it is great.
1,Useless,Its bears no relationship to the color on the description or exterior of the cap - like most Minwax products. Its not worth using.......
4,Enjoyable Story.,"My nephew, when he was young enjoyed this story and now wanted to share this story with his children. So it was reordered."
5,Great Product,"I bought this for a friend of mine. She LOVED it. Thanks so much! Fast delivery, new product, good seller."
5,Other Wordly!,"I owned this set of songs on CD when it first came out, but I was stupid and traded it for credit at a used music store! Now, no longer available at your local retail store, I vow to buy it back online eventually! The band shows amazing skill with precision playing and perfect production on this sophmore metal release. I love the guitar work and distinctive vocals even though I can't understand the language! There are several stand-out tunes on this album which hold their value even today-- years after the band members moved on to other things. That quality is called ""timeless"" and is only found in the best of songwriting and arranging. If you dig tight metal music with kick-ass melodic guitar, this disc is for you!"
5,"An eco-novel so easy to pick up, so hard to put down!","Richard Trout's Elephant Tears: Mask Of The Elephant is a thriller adventure novel set in the foothills of Mt. Kilimanjaro, moves across the wild game parks of East Africa, and ends up at the seaport of exotic Mombasa, when the three MacGregor kids, their mother, and their zoologist father are in search over ivory poachers. Superbly researched and written, Elephant Tears is one of those infrequent novels for young readers that are so easy to pick up, and so hard to put down! Also highly recommended is Trout's first adventure novel featuring the MacGregors, Cayman Gold: Lost Treasure Of Devils Grotto."
3,Eh......,The image on the cover is very misleading. I agree with what the other reviewers are saying about how the story is sugar coated to make it sound like communism the best thing to ever happen.
5,A very good and accurate history.,"Even though this film was produced and created by the P.R. China in celebration of the 60th Anniversity of P.R. China, it is not a completely propaganda product as one would expect. The film fairly treats both sides of the conflict (i.e. theCommunists and the Nationalists). It is an epic with a large cast, many of the actors and actresses are unknown to Western audiences. However, there are some interesting surprises with those who are familiar to Western audiences. Jackie Chang, with a moustache and glasses, portraying a newspaper reporter. Ziyi Zhang asa Communist cultural representative. Jet Li as a Nationalist admiral. This film is a must for high school and college courses in History and the 20th Century. It does provide a very good background of the emergence of the P.R. China as a global ""Superpower"" today."
1,Will NOT play on US/Canadian Region A Player!!!,"I purchased this from the Amazon UK site (Amazon.co.uk) because it was touted there, as here in the US, as being region-free, but it's not. At least it won't play on my US Region A PS3. If you live in the US or Canada, don't waste your money!!!"
1,Not an action packed movie!!! False advertising!!!,"This my first review of ANYTHING on amazon, only to warn other Kung fu movie fans to NOT buy this thinking it's an action film! It's a historical drama without ANY Kung fu action at all! The 3 main ""stars"" on the cover art, appear for less than 5 minutes on screen, and not even in the same scene no less! Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and Donnie Yen, are in minor, bit roles that could have been portrayed by a nobody in Asia or Hollywood and the movie would have had the same effect."
4,"nive, solid performance from Wiener and Harnoncourt","performance is very solid, with Wiener Philharmoniker's rich sound and Harnoncourt's sure handed interpretion will satisfy many. although, I have to admit I prefer Welser Most's version, it has more brisk tempo and has more firm control of the orchestra.by the way, you can get this CD for around 35 dollars in Amazon.de, Jpc or other European online store. Don't waste your $68 to get used copy from those used cd seller."
5,I'll be the first to admit it...,"I have an obsession with Lava Soap. I would much rather use this soap than any other soap. It get's you clean, it makes you feel clean, it's green. Granted, you should NOT scrub with this soap or you'll tear a hole in your leg, doesn't seem to hurt hands though. Unfortunately it's hard to find unless your really look for it. They have it at Walmart and Fry's, but that's about it. It's inexpensive and makes me happy. It smells awesome too. I highly recommend this soap."
5,JUCA,This Helmet is the bomb. The neck cover is great for bad weather and you can unzip for hot weather. My Ipod earphones fit and I can block out the real world!
1,JUNK,IT'S TOO LOUD AND PRODUCES A LOW VOLUME OF AIR. MY WOOD STOVE PUTS MORE HEAT OFF WITHOUT IT THAN WITH IT AND LIKE I SAID IT'S TOO LOUD TO HAVE ON AND TRY TO WATCH TV OR LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE SAME ROOM
5,My dad loves these slippers,"When these arrived I wasn't sure about them. I thought they were supposed to be super soft, but seemed pretty stiff. My Dad has had 3 back surgeries and has numbness in his one leg that causes discomfort in his foot. However, he has told me that these slippers feel very good and give good support.If you are looking for a soft cushiony slipper though, these are not for you."
3,It is just a walkthrough for the game.,"Probably I didn't properly appreciate the book because I've played the game. The book feels like a detailed walkthrough and doesn't really add anything to the gaming experience, it doesn't contain almost any new details. (in comparison, the Myst books are valuable addition to the Myst games, because they cover parts of the story not mentioned in the games...) I think one should buy either the game or the book, according to the degree of interactivity one prefers. I love the Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers *game* and it is my all-time favourite adventure game; probably the book can become somebody's favourite book, too..."
5,Amazing!!! No mystery/horror reader should miss!!,"This is the best book I ever read! If you have played the game but haven't read this you don't know what you're missing! Never have I read a book before that I loved from the very first page! This book is more than a mystery or horror novel, it has everything: comedy, tragedy, you name it! No library should be without it!"
1,Could have been MUCH better.,"I loved the game... don't get me wrong there. But the book, in my opinion, was like... Jane just played through the game, changing a bit of dialogue, and finished. There were more details in the game than in the book. I sincerly hope that the Beast Within book will have SOMEthing. For example, a way to make this better would be to give readers clues along the way, so they can figure it out in their head, like Agatha Christie and Stephen King do."
4,A really enjoyable read,"I really liked the novel version of this story. Even though I had played the CD-ROM before I read the novel. The novel is well written and it makes you think. I have not played the second game, but I am eagerly awaiting the second novel in this series, ""The Beast Within"" so I can follow the story and learn more about the powers of the Shattenjagers, Gabriel Knight's family. In all this book is well worth reading"
2,Just Another Compilation of Old Videos!,"I bought this and was so excited because I love Tracey's fun way of teaching and Cardio Boot Camp is one of my kickbutt faves! I also have Jab Kick & Burn which is great too, but get those instead and save your money! This tape took the second 20 minute section of Boot Camp and put it with a section of Jab Kick & Burn that isn't on that tape, but the group is wearing all the same outfits and was obviously taped during that same time. Don't buy it."
3,OK workout... bad tape editing,"This tape is good for days that I don't feel like working out at all because it is fairly easy. I usually go ahead and do both segments since I don't get much out of doing just one. I don't know if it's just my tape which I got through amazon.com, but the editing is horrible. In the first half I have a good 10 seconds of blackout on the screen in the middle of the workout. The end of the cool down on the second half seems to just cut off in the middle of the final stretch. This why I gave it 3 stars, or else I would have given it 4 stars since I have worse tapes (like Crunch Fitness with Billy Blanks)."
2,20/20 Series is a complete disappointment!,"I was very shocked that The Method 20/20 series appears to be very slim in the way of content. I have this DVD as well as another one and it was just that, 20 minutes of very basic moves. Will be the last of that series that I purchase."
5,Gluten Free GENIUS,"This pasta is the best of the best.While I'm not very picky in my eating habits, even I got annoyed when every gluten free pasta I tried ended up more like a gluten free paste from getting so mushy and disfigured once cooked. This stuff is perfect. It legitimately does NOT get mushy. I have no idea how that strange little bunny on the package did it, but he has. And I thank him.This stuff is EASILY swapped in for regular pasta. They seriously won't know the difference.Hallelujah!"
5,Great Pasta!,This is the absolute best gluten-free pasta out there. There is no way to tell the difference between this and regular wheat pasta. We have tried most of the other brands and nothing compares to this.
4,great alternative,"Since discovering celiac disease in our family, we have looked for an alternative to 'regular' pasta. This is by far the best one out there!!!"
5,Great pasta,"Never tried their penne before and it is very good. We love their other pastas, but we haven't found the penne in the stores yet. Excellent value. With 2 gluten free kids, this is perfect - the other kid (and us parents) don't even know that it's gluten free."
5,Great texture for a GF Pasta,"Since i live a gluten free lifestyle, I try all the gf pastas. This is by far the best in my book with the consistency of wheat flour pastas.It's a large bag of pasta, which will make enough for at least 8 people (with heeping plates full). But once bag is opened, you have to store in plastic or glass container to keep fresh - so not convenient unless you're using entire bag at once.I've cooked it traditionally, boiling and then cooling - and also the way it suggests on bag, boil quickly and cool longer. Both work fine.Again, my favorite thing about this pasta is the texture. When I add a small amount of olive oil it melts in my mouth. The flavor is bland (which it's supposed to be - it's pasta!) and it goes well with an assortment of cheeses.They're a little more expensive than other brands, but worth it to me for taste.Love to mix it with vegetables. Enjoy!"
5,Best GF pasta,"The best gluten free pasta brand I have ever tried. The texture is just like ""regular"" pasta. Don't overcook! I cook it for 10 minutes.It tends to get a dry texture when stored in the fridge. But add some sauce and microwave it and it gets nice and soft again. For cold salads, if I make a tuna pasta salad, I try to make just enough, because of the dryness factor."
4,Informative and detailed.,This book certainly reveals the complete tradegy of abortion and makes one wonder how the lives presented would have been different had the unfortunate decision to undergo the procedure would not have been made to begin with.
2,Sad but true...,too bad no one could interview the aborted babies and get their perspective on abortion.
5,Invaluable,"This product is invaluable. Anyone who uses a laptop computer outside should own and use one of these sun shades. How I ever used a laptop outside without using one of these is a complete mystery. That something so simple is so unknown and so unused it is logic defying. I am not exaggerating one bit, I am completely serious. This product made our trip down the Intracoastal waterway possible. It was used to shade our chart plotting program and render it visible in our very bright pilothouse. Our GPS is hooked to our laptop computer which does all the work and also displays all the charts on the computer screen. Without the sun shade, our trip would not have happened. Our ice-maker was a big help too.This is an awesome invention and product, well worth the price.Porge"
4,"Good quality, well made toy",My daughter just LOVES Emily! All of the Thomas and Friends toys are very well made and should last a long time.
4,Delight,I am never disappointed in any Thomas Engine toys and I have two grandsons that really love them. They are very interchangable with other toys and does not disappoint my grandsons if I get plastic or wooden. We make up stories and that really helps with imagining that you are really the conductor etc. It does not hurt that Emily is the name of my grandson's mother.
3,New Trains Have Smaller Wheel Base,"We bought Emily because my daughter loved the Five New Engines video. Unfortunately, there must be fine print somewhere that says these new die-cast trains do not fit on the old tracks. We also have a new set of Clarabel and Annie, and they have the same small-wheel base issue."
3,Interesting....but not very...,"My boyfriend and I watched this movie last night. It gets boring at times but it makes you want to finish it just to see what really happened. It has an interesting plot, but my boyfriend and I found the character of ""Dora"" to be somewhat unreal. I wish she had been more like a real person that anyone might know, I think that would have made you want to care more about the character. There were also a couple of parts in the movie that he nor I really could understand. All in all, if you like a good mystery, it is that if nothing else."
4,"Lots of actors from Friday the 13th, the Series","Many of the actors are cross-overs from Friday the 13th, the Series. Including: Chris Wiggins (Jack Marshack), Sean McCann (Johnnie's ""Pop""), David Ferry (the punchy boxer in the boxing-gloves episode), and Bernard Behrens (Robert E. Lee in the Civil-War/time-travel episode). The music and overall atmosphere are similar to the show: anxious and brooding, with thin faces and vivid colors."
1,"Run, don't walk!",Run away from this book! Don't Walk!! Do whatever you can to avoid reading this book. Makes an excellent paperweight.
4,A Book Of Interviews,"This book is a must for any Bruce Lee or American Karate practitioner. Here Dr. Beasley, founder of the World Martial Arts Group and Karate College, interviews some of the 1st generation Bruce Lee students. They discuss Bruce's ideas about combat and training, and speak about their own views on martial arts. The interviews with Bruce Lee protege Dan Inosanto and Joe Lewis are a must. They are candid and insightful.The book, however, should have avoided implementing photographs to demonstrate certian techniques. The book isn't a primer on Jeet Kune Do concepts and this only fills space which could have either been discarded or re-worked into more interviews with other well known Jeet Kune Do instructors."
1,Not for experienced developers...,"If you are a newbie and like to have your hand held at each step, then this book is for you. However, if you are an experienced developer, the constant step 1, step 2, ...step n approach can be extremely annoying and distracting. At least it was for me.For experienced developers looking to quickly ramp up on Flex 2, I would recommend ""Programming Flex 2"" by Kazoum & Lott instead. It gave better explanations of the options available and when one was more appropriate than the other."
4,GREAT book!,"I wasn't too convinced about this book @ the beginning. It really is perfect for any beginners, and those seeking to get familiar w/Flex. I've been designing/coding in Flash for almost a decade now, and this book sure made the transition allot easier. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because the examples are all related, so if you're into building up the same example as you progress thru the book, this is perfect."
2,Helpful BUT badly written,"The book offers good introduction to Flex 2 and includes many tips as well. But the big problem for this books is the writing style. The examples are usually modified/enhanced examples from previous chapters. But the authors relentlessly go through each line changes with a huge paragraph; it often looks something like ""remove this line, add this component, and save"". A usual half page worth of content is bloated to 3, 4 pages of tedious step-by-step instructions. I personally would prefer to see the code changes between 2 versions directly, something like a side-by-side code snippet comparison would do the trick."
3,"How is it possible to make stories of betryal hilarious? ""Cheaters"" is the answer!","Between surveillance, briefing the client, the confrontation, and using big words, ""Cheaters"" will grab your attention and entertain you in a sick sort of way.Joey Greco, the host, is my favorite part of the show; he even fooled me a few times into believing how much he cares about the deceived victims! It is a fact though, that the show is hilarious between using dramatic words, Joey Greco, and the crazy reactions of people.I'm kind of embarrassed saying that I liked it, but it still makes me laugh and for that alone, it is worth watching."
2,it's funny the first time,it's funny the first time but i cant watch it again so i would rent not buy... plus it fake so ... save your money
1,Never got it,I cannot review this product as I never received it. They kept sending me AF1160 air filter instead of FF1160 fuel filter.
3,Otis Taylor from cradle to rocking chair,"An easy read covering Otis' entire life. Otis includes all the famous incidents with in depth coverage of the babysitting episode, the Super Bowl catch and the Ben Davidson takedown. Lots of pictures which I liked. Otis doesn't skirt the rascist problems he encountered, but doesn't dwell on them either. I thought he could have been a lot tougher on GM Jack Steadman. Numerous quotes from former friends and teammates demonstrate what generous, great guy he is. Every Chiefs fan knows he oughta be in the Hall of Fame, but don't take our word for it, just compare his stats (in the book) to Lynn Swann's."
4,Chiefs Great Otis Taylor,"This book is a good read for Kansas City Chiefs fans who remember the great Chiefs teams of the 1960's and early 1970's. Although at times the book doesn't flow that well and seems choppy, it is an intersting read for the fan to learn more about Chiefs great Otis Taylor. I would recommend it."
3,Probably more like 3 1/4 stars,"Otis Taylor tells his life story in his honest way. He really was a great player and he knows that and tells you so, but it mostly doesn't come off as too arrogant, just honest.Taylor does a great job covering his life through the early seventies. He enjoyed a lot of success, as did his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. He provides some thought-provoking glimpses into racism and teamwork in a turbulent era.My only real complaint is that the book seems to quickly run out of steam as the Chiefs and Taylor fade. I would have loved to learn more about such a great athlete fading and accepting his career's end. I can handle his openness about his greatness, but how about when the greatness starts to diminish? The book does pick up a bit when Taylor discusses his post-playing career."
1,Rip-Off!!!,"I was very insulted when I received this product to find that it was falsely pictured and described! The gift set was supposed to include a tube of lotion, a small bottle of the cologne, and a sample vial of the cologne. Actually there was a sample size of the cologne and a very small tube of the body lotion. This is false advertising in my opinion. This should not be tolerated."
1,"for those not lost in there own pretensiousness - or one too many mod music programs at the university - this is, well, garbage","Want melody? Harmony? Coherence? Talent? Go elsewhere. It would be just as effective a statement of the supposed chaos of life to simply dump the contents of your trash can in the middle of your living room floor as it would to 'compose' this work. The very word is antithetical to this work.Music is the expression of the soul. I suppose this work would adequately express the soul of a postmodern nihilist, but then again, perhaps this work is evidence that postmodern nihilists should stay out of the music business altogether.I await the cacophany of detractors claiming I completely miss the point of this 'artist'. No, I get his point. I'm simply saying it's not a point worth spending the time to attach musical notation to."
5,"St. John the Baptist research San Juan, Texas","I needed this book for research on an application for a Texas Historical Marker. Well, the price of this book was a bargain. Other seller wanted 6 times as much as what I paid for it. Awsome!! And this book is one we should have here in San Juan in the Rio Grande Valley."
5,Fascinating,"I watched this with my mouth hanging half open and then immediately watched it again. Sure, I find ""throat-singing"" interesting, but I had no idea that these people lived in such inhospitable climes, that they have to protect their animals from snow leopards (!), nor that they have this rich storytelling tradition."
4,I never knew of turks living in tuvinia.,I accept that previously it was very difficult to obtain any information from the soviet times.
4,Makes you question your assumptions.,"You don't need a high school diploma to rip out a living sheep's main artery with your bare hands. You just need the specific skill. The culture will train you in the skills you need to be successful. Can a person really see the future, literally? The Shaman is positive. Is he wrong? Or am I wrong? Naturally I think he is wrong. He is a ""primitive,"" right? Does it matter than I have read Homer and Kant? I wonder. Also: why does the woman care that the videographers catch her with her hair not tied up? We're talking goat herders here, not Madonna. What is it with the vanity of personal presentation? Is it universal?"
2,Very disappointing,"I found this book to be very disapointing. After reading American Soldier by Gen. Tommy Franks I was looking forward to another fasinating veiw of the planning and execution of the Afgan and Iraq wars. Inside Centcom only regurgitated what Gen. Franks already wrote in his own book. Also, Delong didn't follow a single thought through, he was all over the place, it was difficult to follow. If you are going to read a book about the latest wars I suggest American Soldier."
2,WAR AND THE GENERALS,"His rational for war is proven wrong but he still insists on WMD. He sees cheering Iraqis in Bagdad but we do not see it. He does not talk about the insurgents and how is the war going on. He takes the responsibility for the ""Mission Accomplished"" but he does not take the responsibilities for all that was wrong with the war. A very biased and one sided view."
5,Pictures speak louder than words,"I purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for a friend who has difficulty reading. She's wanted to grow mushrooms for quite a while but was confused and intimidated by the information presented in books. The simple visual format of ""Let's Grow Mushrooms"" has given her the ability to see and understand the steps involved, while the simple, straightforward audio has increased her comprehension of the subject. She's delighted with the video, which arrived in a timely manner, and I'm happy to have given a gift that will be referenced over and over again."
3,Amateur at best....,"Really?Too long, delays with graphics. This 2 CD set could easily have been on one CD without the childish segways. The most glaring problem with this video is the complete omission of how to inoculate the rye grain. Yes, it shows everything up to the complete sterilization and prep of the grain for the liquid or material mycelium, but that's where it stops. Then it moves to what to do with the inoculated grain jars & bags, completely skipping the most important and vital part. Frustrating? YES! Childish and slow? YES! Otherwise, informative? YES! And therefore, that's why I give it 3 stars. If you are looking for complete info, look somewhere else. If you have endless time to view childish, demeaning videos of incomplete info, than this is right up your ally."
5,I am the first?!? Hard to believe but awesome!!,"To any budding mycologist: Consider these videos required material. Buy them at the same time or even before you purchase your brown rice flour, grain, jars, or pressure cooker. These guys show you almost everything you need to know when it comes to growing mushrooms...almost any kind. They show how to collect spore prints, make syringes, inoculate jars, spawn to bulk substrate, clone, work with grain and agar, and so much more. The videos do not spend much time on fruiting parameters because these are species specific and vary quite a lot.For info regarding species specific fruiting parameters head on over to The Shroomery(google) and ask roger rabbit and roadkill yourself."
5,Everything you need to know,"This movie is a hands on guide for everything you need to know to start growing mushrooms. With the advice in the movie, I've been successful at every mushroom project I've tried. Excellent format and very easy to understand. The music is a little corny though. And, sometimes the process detail repeats itself."
3,Enchanted,"It's ok, but if your looking for a lot of love scenes don't waste your time. The only love scene is in the very last chapter on the last 2 pages. I'm glad I purchased this thru auction and didn't pay full price."
4,Good book with so-so ending,"I loved this book when I started reading it. It was a great story, well written, and the characters were great! I was ""enchanted"" until the end. The ending was disappointing. The author would like us to believe that the villians, who raped and kidnapped innocent young women, and killed several men to cover it up, could be run out of town by the hero threatening to hurt them? It seemed a little far-fetched to me. Other than the ending being a little hard to believe, I thought the book was a good read."
1,False Advertisement!!!,"Well, my daughter picked these shoes out, and said she wanted Santa to bring them to her.. I order the shoes, and expedited the shipping to have them here in time, only to have a completely different looking pair of shoes arrive! It is the Friday before Christmas, and there is no way I am gonna be able to get the shoes pictured above for her for Christmas!!! I would just like to thank all those involved in in this case of fraud!! Please be warned that you will not receive the shoes pictured when ordering these shoes!!!!!"
4,brought back memories,Very interesting to me a I spent 6 months in a nearby town just 4 years after the war. The places and people were not much different from when the author was there.Will be recommending the book to my Tuscan friends.
2,An amateur personal history,"Tullio Bertini has written an earnest, but amateur book about his childhood experiences in Italy. His memories of his life there are interesting, but don't come to life because he's not very skilled at narrative, but only at writing ""just the facts"". He includes plenty of detail about what was going on in WW II at the time -- a little too much, it seemed to me. He also tells a lot about how things were done in his village, such as harvesting and roasting chestnuts, making charcoal, etc. The book is nearly half over before the Germans show up in town. Then he does relate some telling incidents, such as the first time Allied warplanes strafed some Germans who were mining a bridge, and what he saw and how he reacted. Contrary to the title, he was not liberated by the Buffalo Soldiers, but by Brazilians! The Buffalo Soldiers arrived several days later. This is an excellent personal history for his family to keep, but does not qualify as a professional memoir."
2,ALMANAC INVESTOR; profit from market history and seasonal trends,"After read over this book, I would like to say that it is okay, meaning it is not that great."
4,Contains tons of info and tons of theories,"This is a great reference, where is contains a lot of compiled data of the years and tries to give some reasons for the tends presented. One main thing I took away from the book was that the market is really just a wild and crazy beast, but there might be some signs that can point to ""warm fuzzies"" for guidance in timing the market (sometimes)."
3,Not a 5 star,"It seems to me that the Almanac Investor works on both superstition and statistics. The only real helpful part I found was on the JB (January Barometer). The author goes on to describe the other 11 months but it almost seems muttled together. I do believe that it is worth taking a look at. Again this seems to work more off of superstition, but has some statistics to back it up."
3,you get what you pay for...,"This is a functional, attractive boombox.I bought it for a kid, and it's fine for that.If you want clarity or good bass, keep looking. If you're just looking for a radio and something that plays cds w/o great sound quality, this is a good deal."
3,An okay cd player for the price,"This isn't the greatest, but for the price it is an acceptable cd player. Actually, I think the sound quality is surprisingly good...but as far as I can tell the ""bass boost"" button is for decorative purposes only.A couple of gripes:1. I bought this to play music outdoors, at the beach, etc. and to my annoyance the lid to the cd tray lets in all manner of dust, sand, etc.2. It's hard to tell what level the volume is on, at a glance, b/c there is no digital reading for this3. The antenna and the plastic clip that locks it in place are both rather delicate. I usually end up busting these at some point on other radios I've owned, though, so it could just be me.The main thing I like is how it can sit on its side for storage...it is pretty stable and takes up little space in this position."
4,Great packaging,Very professional packaging and nice layout.Sounds are crisp and well thought out.Not quite 'Acidized' but you can make minor edits to get it there.overall I'm pretty happy with the samples in general.
1,Don't like this product,eJay Sound collection is a very difficult program to use.It doesn't have easy explanations to follow.I bought it but I want to return it.
3,"Does the job, but the mirror fell off after 3 months.","Really easy to apply to the location of the old mirror. The tape didn't last though, so it requires something stronger to hold it on."
2,exactly what I asked for,"Bought it for a friend. Tried to program it, without success. left it with the friend to call alarm company"
5,Entre',Works perfectly from a distance. No wiggly motions needed to get the signal to reach the base.
3,OOOPS!,"The diaper is just that, a doggy diaper. I bought these ""just in case"" and hope I never have to use them. My mini schnauzer has a docked tail so when I tried one on just for fun, it didn't stay in place and he was trying to pull it off anyway. I don't think he'll keep these on but maybe a dog with a real tail would be better at keeping it on."
3,good music for the soul,anything by Andrae is a treat. this early collection shows the power of classic gospel. good listening and sing-along!
3,Good information but...,"The author made some good statements and arrived at some conclusions that I have experienced in my own life. However, the book lacks greater and better support for the information in the book. The book contains some philosophical statements concerning what to do when faced with a decision making process at a given time and place, who to talk to, how to visualize one self in a different and better situation and, last but not least, the concept of forgiving one self, which I usually frown upon statements like this one. It is not bad, but I think that it needed more meat and support."
5,I have a stack of Linear books: this is the best I've seen.,It covers linear control processes well.Best it gives MatLab code for plotting responses and solvedproblems.It has a 6th order filter called Chebyshev digital filterthat has a very near flat top as a band pass in the Bode plot!These methods aren't well covered in my other booksand will be of use in studying nonlinear systems as well.
2,"Cute idea, but bad material/packaging","This is an adorable set of heart cookie cutters; sadly, however, I had to return them, as they arrived rusty and dirty, in no packaging besides for a twister wire holding them together.Too bad, as they were really cute. I would have expected better from Amazon."
2,"Poor quality, no case","Pretty much agree with the other negative reviews, these are very poorly made with a very obvious and almost gaping joint right at the top of the heart, and there's no case, which is almost standard with cutter sets like this. Avoid."
3,Bad movie..,I bought this for my sister who loves Pauly Shore.. It's a boring movie. But if you're a fan it's alright.
3,Pauly rules,"This movie wasn't that great.It was ok, but it was a huge step down from pauly's other movies.I give it three stars because pauly is my favorit actor.If he wasn't in the movie it rely would have sucked.I say do not pay $50.00 for it. rent it or buy it cheaply."
4,A few nice minutes with Yvonne,"Elliman's home-made EP is a fine little window into Yvonne's life in the Twentyfirst Century. Althought the first three songs seem a personal mirror to her, they are more fully produced pop and rock statements. The fourth song is a sweet thing - a little confection made at home. A fifth track recuts the EP's signature song, Simple Needs. It makes us wish for more from Yvonne Elliman, but glad to have what we've got."
2,SMALL,Bought the xxl shirt for my husband and it barley went over his chest.. this is his normal size shirt. It runs very small.
1,If I could give this negative stars- I would,"I ordered this shirt as a Christmas gift. The company sent the wrong item, and i got no response from the customer service email listed on the invoice. Finally I contacted them through Amazon, and got the right shirt- but it was so cheaply made I was too embarassed to give it."
3,DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"So Disappointed! Bought for self and a gift. This screen is clear - we all know our WD screens were a light green. I guess color videos are ok -- but what era? The 50's videos: First ""set"" played ok.Second ""set"" had the SOUND TRACK of the FIRST set overlaid! I'm sending it back. Was so excited becausepreviously had found only one of the ""original"" tapes in TV museum in Chicago. The interview about makingWD was enlightening - but could have just run full -- and not been divided up into ""sections."" Seemedsilly that way."
2,Not comfortable,"I had similar gardening gloves that I'd cut a fingertip off of with my gardening sheers. So I bought these to replace them. My old gloves (though well worn in) were MUCH more comfortable. I don't bother wearing these, as I'd rather rub my fingers against my plants than rub them against the fabric of these gloves. :-/"
1,I would give this a minus Star!,"I bought this for my upper lip hair, and read the panflet carefully, and did everything they say you should do to get excellent results.... even leaving the produtc for no longer than 8 minutes(ZZZZzzzz) and.... nothing at all! it didn't work! not even on one itsy bitsy hair. 't If I were you I wouldn't bother. It's the worst face hair remover I ever tried."
1,Didn't work at all,I followed all the instructions and left it on for eight minutes--it removed very very fine light hairs that would have been fine on my face anyway--but did not remove the darker hairs. Don't buy it--it doesn't work.
1,This is terrible!,"I've now tried it twice, this time leaving the creme on a bit longer in hope of better results. No such luck! I'd say this removes maybe 50% of my facial hairs - it's better on thinner hair above my lip, but worse on mid-range hairs between my eyebrows and on/under my jawline, and barely removed any hairs from my mole at all. I bought Sally Hansen because I thought it was a brand I could trust: I was wrong."
1,Doesn't work!,"I followed the instructions carefully, and after leaving the cream on my upper lips for about 7 minutes, nothing happened whatsoever!!! None of my hair was removed. I tried this for two more times after a couple of days, but still, nothing happened. Don't waste your money on this... I'm sure you can find better ones out there!"
1,Chemical burn!!!!,"The first time I used this product it worked great. The second time it hardly removed any hair. Third time it started to burn after 3 minutes and didn't remove any hair. Gave it one last try tonight, it started to burn the second I put it on. Removed it immediately and am left with a terrible chemical burn on my upper lip.This is a cheap and terrible product."
1,I would give it NO stars,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is harmful to your skin. It literally burned the skin off of my face and did absolutely NOTHING to remove hair. Not only do I still see hair but now I have an ugly scab on my chin. I do not have sensitive skin so I didn't do the test that they recommend. So, if your goal is to burn the skin right off of your face then, yes, this is the stuff for you. Honestly, I think this product should be removed from the shelves."
4,Works the way I expected,"Good product, actually purchased it because I had already tried it from my sister. Works like magic and takes a short period of time only. Saves me from having to go back to the dermatologist for facial hair laser which, after over a year's worth of scheduled laser, still yields growth anyway. Definitely a cheaper alternative."
1,disappointment. Lost trust in the brand,"the product imply does not work. Leave it on and it does nothing. I was really into sally hansen's range of products, esp their waxes but after this, I havent tried anything new from the brand."
1,Should be discontinued,I followed the instructions and it didn't work. I even placed a warm rag on my chin to soften the hairs and it didn't work. This item SUCKS!! Do not buy any Sally Hansen hair removal waxes or creams for face because they don't work!! I know b/c I've tried them all and all I got was a numb chin! Save your money!
3,Just okay,When I ordered this I thought I was getting something else. Its not exactly what I wanted but its not bad. It is not a bleach it is actually a hair remover. Maybe I should have read more into the description.
1,Won't use this ever again.,"This gave me an awful chemical burn on my chin. I followed the instructions, but it started to sting soon after application. I thought this was normal so I left it on, but ended up washing it off when the stinging got worse. I was left with a second-degree burn on my chin. My husband called the poison control center. They said to wash it with mild soap and water. Then follow with running my chin under cold water for as long as I could stand it. They recommended at least 20 mins. My skin reminded me of how ice looks after you sprinkle rock salt on it. I healed, after a couple weeks. I understand that this may not happen to everyone. Please think twice though, because I had used this in the past with no problems. And if it starts to sting, please wash it off right away. Don't wait like I did!"
1,Face Burner,"This is one of the worst products I have ever tried. It not only failed to work, it left my face red and raw. It felt like a toxic compound. The effects took hours to go away even with a good moisturizer."
5,works great,Got it in the mail...and decided to try it...works great!!! Glad i ordered and will continue using it...so much better than waxing..
5,"Works ths first time, everytime!","I purchased my tube at Walgreens about a year ago, and it's about half way full.To use, apply it thickly, let it sit and wipe down with toilet paper or a soft washcloth. VoilÃ¡! Hair free lip. Generously apply the calming liquid and don't wash it off (say with soap and water or facial cleanser) or sweat, else it'll sting and burn. Don't skip the liquid! If you do need to wash your face, avoid the area that you just depilated.A side note: DON'T MIX THIS SYSTEM WITH ANOTHER DEPILATOR. IT WILL TURN RED, STING AND BURN. I know from experience."
1,It left my face with no skin - burned it!,"I used this product once before and it didn't quite do the job, it left hair behind on my upper lip, so last night I decided to leave it on a little longer, 6 minutes to be exact, and I washed my face with cold water and a wet cotton ball to gently go over it so that it would get all the hairs, well, it got all the hairs and then some, my skin!! Today I am all scarred up! =( I used it on the sides of my face, tiny little fuzzy hair. I'm so bummed out and upset!"
5,"It's a gag book, get it? And a gut-bustingly funny one, at that!","There is nothing to read in the book because there is nothing to write about ""sex after 60!"" That's why the cover say, ""The most complete book in the field."" The back cover says, ""Everything there is to know on the subject."" One ""reviewer"" on the back cover is quoted as saying, ""Absolutely true from cover to cover... a real page turner!"""
5,First class history by a first class scholar,"The book weaves together historical, cultural and religious trends and events to paint a vivid picture of German history. A must for anyone interested in the topic."
2,this book is too verbose,"this book is not very helpful toward understanding german history. sure, there are lots of paragraphs full of intricate text, but there is little meaning or overall coherence. even if this book is a recommended reading for your class (as it has been for me), there are better alternatives. Avoid."
4,Slipper Heaven,"Very comfortable, warm and fashionable.These don't attract and hang on to pet hair like others do.I like the traction; I can go out on the snowy front porch and not fall down. Let's see if they hold up."
1,"Not a reference, or a good intro either.","A quick reference should be a concise compilation of procedures and data on an application. I have other books from the Dummies Quick Reference series that fit that bill very well, but this one does not. Rather, it is an extremely simple introduction to Netscape. If you have played with Communicator for more than a few hours, you won't get anything new out of this book."
2,"An excellent work, but a poor translation.","I do not mean, by giving this book a poor rating, to dissuade anyone from reading Sophocles' greatest works. Rather, I would instead urge everyone to avoid the Slavitt & Bovie translations specifically. Examples of the excessive liberties that they have taken with other Attic dramas include inserting puns and one liners into the Chorus of Agamemnon, adding references to Black American hymns to the Chorus of the Libation Bearers, as well as many smaller, but still significant translation crimes. Get the Grene & Lattimore or almost any other version of these works, but do not get the Slavitt & Bovie"
5,Great for the price.,"I bought this for my daughter's room. I was looking for something pink or purple and this just was perfect. It is not the greatest quality on earth, but it's very cute.It came with a scratch on the front, and after contacting Amazon, I received my replacement clock the next day, as Amazon shipped it express. I only had to put the bad one in the box and ship it back with a label they provided.You gotta love Amazon for standing behind their products and their great customer service."
2,Too loud,"This clock is cute, inexpensive, and keeps time just fine, but it is so loud that we can't keep batteries in it or nobody gets any sleep. Too bad since it really seems to be designed for a child's room."
3,Not so quiet,"The clock looks nice enough for the price, but I found it too loud for my tastes. It doesn't bother my two daughters but both my wife and I find it very noticeable when the house is quiet.Unfortunately the packaging is not very protective and the face of the clock is left open. I ordered two of these clocks and they both ended up with some superficial hazing on their faces from moving around even though the shipping box was packed well. It doesn't affect reading the clock at all, but its a noticeable blemish.Overall they're OK for the money and I haven't found a comparable design that I think my daughters would like.Edit: In the end the clock was too loud at night and we ended up giving these away."
1,Cute but a terrible buy,The clock came with the face so badly scratched you could not really make out the time. It was not packaged well at all. I would avoid this clock altogether. Wish I had read the other poor reviews first instead of choosing based on looks alone.
2,You get what you pay for,"This clock is inexpensive, but the time itself slows by 5 minutes a day (even with a brand new battery)."
2,Cute but cheap,"This clock is cute, but if I wanted a clock in my kids room I'd just get a digital. You can teach them to read some other wall clock with hands, or a watch. This is loud and cheap."
4,A Perfect Princess Clock,"My tween loves the color pink. I was just reviewing the page when she spotted the Pink Petals Wall Clock andI knew it was love at first sight. The white face makes it very easy to view the time, and the flower shapeis precious. Very satisfied am I."
4,The West of Today Captured on Film,A series of photo's that capture the modern day cowboys and the area countryside they call home.The pictures shows sides of America many people don't know still exist. I have treasured this book for several years.
4,Beautiful photographs of a truly vanishing breed,"This book was published in 1982 when the cowboy and the cowboy way of live was already vanishing. Now nearly 30 years later, I would imagine there are now even less of them.Allard, a long-time contributor to National Geographic, is probably one of the greatest living photographers around. He's brilliant at both capturing landscapes and people-no small feat as most photographers tend to be better at one than the other. Even if you are not that interested in the West, I recommend this book to any would-be photographer who is interested in shooting people, landscapes or both in natural life."
4,FRESHMAN COLLEGE STUDENT,"Great information and practices, the book was more worn out than I thought, but all and all, it was good."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"The original book had 118 PLATES THAT ARE OMITTED FROM THIS BOOK.They are described in text at pages 328-500! BUT HOW CAN YOUHAVE AN UNILLUSTRATED ENGINEERING HISTORY?There is still an immense amount of information in 288 pages with231 pages of appendices and a few illustrations, but MUCH IS NOTUNDERSTANDABLE WITHOUT THE MISSING PLATES.Thomas Tredgold's original was 1827; this is Woolhouse's revisionof 1838.So, and since there was a third edition of 1850-3, if you arelooking (as I was) for information stated to be in ""Tredgold"" onan 1850 steamboat, you will again be disappointed in this book."
4,Use your laptop outside in bright sun,"This is a good product and works well. I wish it didnt taper down toward the front as it restricts seeing the entire screen of the laptop. But, it is very nice sitting outside in the bright sunlight and using the laptop. Its made pretty durable and ive folded it up many times and stuck it in my laptop case. Easy to put on and take off too. A good invention, but needs that one improvement i mentioned above."
1,disappointing product,This product doesn't block/reduces sun glare at all.I was very disappointed when I tried to use my laptop on my sunny deck.I would not recommend this product to anyone.
4,strange & beautiful,"i bought this book after receiving french's ""soap lady"" as a gift. i loved that book &, while this one exhibits the same artistry, it is much edgier & rawer. of course, it's also not a children's book like the former but, setting aside the content, the drawings themselves display a grittier style.this is definitely an adult book &, while i found some of the themes fascinating & disturbing, some might find them merely disturbing. just a warning for the faint of heart.still, the drawings are mesmerizing overall & the slices of storyline are evocative & engaging."
5,Very relaxing,"I bought this cd hoping to hear the sounds of a train similar to the sound of one passing near my house when I was a child. I was not disappointed. It was very relaxing and sounds of the clickty clack on the rails and a distant whistle with all aboard to start it off. I put it in my cd player at night and before it has played very long, I am sound asleep!"
5,Mesmerized,I truly go into a trance while I am listening to this cd on my ipod! It is easy to pretend that I am a child on a train to California again. My only criticism is that the train whistle blows every 35 seconds in some sections of the cd and I wish that I could delete those!
3,Interesting Nostalgia,"I enjoyed the ""train ride"" but would have chosen another cd instead. I have not tried it as a sleep aid yet---I suppose it might be relaxing background noise----I love trains though and that is why I purchased the cd."
2,"Will put you to sleep, sort of...","Very boring if you have ever been on the old 1960's passenger trains.No stops for this train.Would have loved more, varied train sounds , likethe door closing in the first 10 seconds. If it had been NYC-Philadelphia,with stops, voices, and the clickety-clack, wow!"
2,Not Impressed,"Quality is poor, tinny and uneven. You may fall asleep to the last 20 minutes. It's getting there (40 minutes) that will keep you awake. Check out Dr. Jeffrey Thompson's audios."
4,The Dealy Game!,the deadly game tornament that was featured on the surivor series 1998 was great. the rock unites with Mcmahon at the end to win the tournament and become the wwf champion. the only bad thing was stone cold getting screwed in he semi-finals of the deadly-game tournament.
3,SURVIVOUR SERIES WAS JUST THAT,"This was an ok tournament.The reason is that the wrestlers didnt do there best.The man that stood out the most was The Rock.He had a nice match with Shamrock and a very quick match with bossman.Most of the matches on this ppv are raw type matches.It was an avserage tournament and it was one that could have been better, if you love The Rock i would purchase this as he and Mankind have a very good match at the end.Rock does win but not the way you would hope.They re-enacted Bret's 97 screw job.Any way if you are a big WWF fan and Rock fan do get it otherwise hire it, it is worth watch."
3,Mixed Feelings!,Every Time I watch The tape...questions come in my mind.....WhyDwayne Gill? Why use the situation that almost crumbled yourcompany a year before? .....Why Shane Why? . If you ever wanted a soap-opera like wrestling video...well this is the one. Oh and if your a Rock Fan you Should own it also.
5,BEST WWF PPV EVER,this is better than any wrestlemania i loved the brackets and the whole tournament was great if you smell what the rock is cooking
3,Survivor Series 98,"The tournament was very bad,the matches were too short.the austin-mankind and rock vs mankind matches saved the show and the turns and angle development was pretty good.Not a bad show"
3,WWF Survivor Series 1998 UPDATE,"First of all Mr GarfieldBK, the 1997 edition of Survivior Series in Montreal far surpassed this 1998 shambles. It was exciting and full of atmosphere. Hell, even the main event between Hart and Michaels drew controversy. Secondly, a review is an UNBIASED analysis of the QUALITY of the card. I'm a Rock fan too, but I won't rate this 5 stars just because he won the belt. Know your role and learn how to review!"
3,It was okay,"This was the first time since WrestleMania 4 back in 1988 that a ppv had a touranment to determine who should capture the vacant wwf title. It was set up just like WM 4 where 14 individuals competed and two automatically were in the second round (those being kane and undertaker). The majority of the matches in this tourament were average or poor. The only matches that really shined in the tourament was Ken Shamrock vs Rock, Rock vs Mankind, and Austin vs Foley. Of course, there was a very shocking development and that was the McMahons master plan and not only screwing Austin both also Mic Foley. If you've seen this show you know what I'm talking about. The undercard which only featured two matches, the women's title match and tag team triple threat title matches were average. Overall, not bad but there are better 1998 ppvs such as King Of the Ring and Summerslam."
2,Below WWF PPV's,"I'm one of the biggest WWF Fans around, and I just thought that this PPV sucked. I mean it could have been great, but the matches were just way too short. Could have been way better, but it just sucked. I would recommend you not buying this video."
3,THIS PAY PER VIEW SUCKED,THE ROCK THE PEOPLES SELL OUT SELLS OUT ON THIS TAPE SO IF YOU LIKE THE PEOPLES CHAMP THEN YOU WON'T LIKE THIS TAPE BUT BESIDES THAT IT WAS OVERALL 3 STARS JUST FOR THE FACT OF THE 16 MAN TITLE TOURNAMENT
2,It could have been better,"The culmination of weeks on television led up to a disappointment. Although I was suprised at the ending, the matches themself were lackluster at best. Overall, poorly developed theme. I can only hope that other pay per views climax better than this one."
3,The 1998 WWF Survivor Series,"In my opinion, the 1997 Survivor Series was better because it had the Heartbreak kid and his most hated foe, Bret Heart in it. It also ended up being the last time we saw the Hitman in the WWF. The 1998 event was good and everything, but it was not all it was supposed to be. I'm a huge Rock fan and still am, but you knew something was up. I really hate Stone Cold Jabronie, because he just get old really fast. oh yeah, if your not down with that, then SUCK IT!!!!"
2,A product you must have but one you don't really want.,"This was purchased for my father in law who is a C-4 Quad. He needs the Roho cushion because of his skin breaking down and a pressure ulcer he has. I have not liked the way the cushion fits on the shower/toilet chair. When he is on it, the biggest part of the air chambers are on the outside of his body and he is not sitting on them.There were no real instructions about how soft or how hard to have the air chamber and the at home therapists were not helpful either. I don't like the way the cushion doesn't stay on the seat of the shower/toilet chair. It doesn't make for a pleasant shower time."
1,"Don't get burned - this is a play, not the novel","Amazon needs to add the word ""PLAY"" to it's headline on this item. This is not the novel Lolita, it's a play based on the novel by Edward Albee."
3,NAKED JUSTICE NOT AS GOOD!!!,"This is the 6th Bernhardt book I have read in the Ben Kincaid series. I think I have rated all the others with five stars. This is the first one I was disappointd in. To me, the trial pages were way to long. He went into to much detail on blood and DNA testing. If I had wanted a medical book I would have read one. All the people I liked were there, Ben, Christina, Jones, Loving and Mike. The first of the book was good and the ending was a surprise, to me at least. The middle was boring and to wordy at times. The ending left me sad and this had not happened in the previous books. I will read number seven as the first five were so good. I surely hope I enjoy it more."
2,No Spark,"This should have been a good book. The story was there. The characters were there. But it just fell flat. Mr. Bernhardt may be a good writer, but he isn't a very good story teller."
1,Poor Product! Stay Away!,I am very disappointed! It is poorly made. Where the seams meet the top has a gap! It's sharp and could easily hurt yourself. Save your money and stay away!
4,worked great so far and easy to use,"This product has worked as advertised so far - it was recommended by the person who sold my wife her hiking shoes which are both cloth and leather (Lowa brand). Even though they're all ready treated and have Gore-tex in them, he said that in his experience, treating them will increase the life of the shoe. We'll see how the product works as we hike on many wet trails in western NC mtns."
5,A wild trip,"As a big fan of DOA since the late seventies, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Joe gives you a great amount of background about one of the hardest working bands ever.If you love punk music and the DIY attitude, this book is must read."
1,unreal,"Wow...forget the reviews on this page, and by others who don't know any better like Randy Bachman and Dave Grohl. Punk was about throwing down the""state"" of things not reproducing self-centered capitalist philosophy in the guise of shameless ""punk"" branding. Anarchists don't run for the Green Party or tour oppressive states like China that routinely murder their own citizens. The state has done a good job of promoting DOA as its punk representatives and I'm sure that the Order of Canada is waiting in the wings to embrace this type of ""safe"" rebellion..."
5,"Slavery's scars, without sentimentality.","This, the second in the Colonial Williamsburg Young Americans series, is the story of a slave boy who moves from Carter's Grove Plantation to Williamsburg when his young master attends the grammar school at the College of William and Mary. This brief tale of mid-seventeenth life is fast-paced and full of action, while yet vibrantly aware of the emotional turmoil suffered by all parties to the blight that was slavery. Nixon, a prolific and talented children's novelist, never allows her writing to dwindle into maudlin political correctness or weep sentimentality. This is a highly recommended book not just for the young readers for which it is intended, but anyone who appreciates a good historical read. Reading this just prior to a visit to Colonial Williamsburg would be a treat indeed."
5,Good read for young history lovers.,"""Caesar's Story: 1759"" is a good book for those being introduced to slavery (not during The Civil War). It's gritty in it own way, in how it deals with a black young slave child and white young owner child starting out as friends, but then becoming slave and master, without the fun memories. The Young Americans series is wonderful because each person was a living being, who lived a life. Even though little is known about Caesar, I'm glad he was given the chance to enter the reading worlds of readers. I recommend."
5,Wonderful,"I ordered this book with high hopes, and I was not disappointed. The book arrived MUCH earlier than I expected it. It is not a hardcover book with a stitched spine, but a spiral bound book with a glossy, almost plastic cover. While I do prefer a hardbound book, I admit that the information contained within, more than makes up for the cover. The book and binding are well made, and I do not mean to diminish their quality--I only wish to make future buyers aware of the product details.As for the information inside the book, it is nothing less than perfect--EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be. This book contains traditional Romanian recipes for all types of foods and meals, even wild game. If you are looking for a vast collection of Romanian recipes, I highly recommend this book."
3,Lead on the cord is disconcerting,"Why Revlon would import a dryer with lead issues is something I don't understand. If I have to wash my hands after using the dryer, what about all the surfaces the cord touches (sink, counter, towels)? The dryer itself works great, but the lead issue scares me."
2,just fan,The disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style. It makes my arm and finger tired.
1,Don't Believe It,"I bought this for My Honey after extensive researach. I selected it because the advertising says it has a cord that swivels. Don't believe it. The cord is fixed, does not turn, and twists and tangles as badly as any other dryer. A simple case of false advertising."
5,Henriksen makes Hit List low-budget hit,"As with any film starring Jan-Michael Vincent (Airwolf), it's got action. But he's not the main provider in this low-budget gem. Lance Henriksen (Aliens) is the man to watch. He walks the wild side as a psychopath who sells ladies shoes. He rarely speaks and doesn't need to. His violent actions and extreme appearance make it unnecessary. He's a real treat to follow. Leo Rossi (Relentless) is his usual cocky self as a mafia lieutenant snagged for the grand jury. Extra class is Rip Torn (Cross Creek) as the mafia don. The film is full of familiar character actor faces and delivers a good time. Worth watching and owning."
1,Never quite hits its stride,"Wildly uneven, this film features a wooden Jan-Michael Vincent as a man whose son is snatched by mistake by a mob hitman (Lance Henriksen) of whom it is said: ""This guy is so twisted that when he dies they're going to have to screw his coffin into the ground."" Does this role sound juicy or what? Unfortunately before things can get really perverse, the hitman dies...and dies, and dies and... Find this in the ""Rasputin"" category at Blockbuster."
4,D H LAWRENCE: A BIOGRAPHY,"The book was heavy in parts, interesting in others. Basically a good read if you are interested in D H Lawrence, who was from what I read a complex author but a dedicated writer. I enjoyed the book, but then I have always enjoyed reading his material."
4,A good story with romance an added plus,"This book is well written for the most part. It takes a look at the daily life of dealing with the issue of Alzheimer's. It is written in such a way that those dealing with this issue will find reading it rather cathartic. The romance flows naturally and is part of the story, but not the only story. However, I found the ending to be less than spectacular. It seemed almost as though the author wanted to write a 300 page book. She took such care with writing the first 297 pages, and then just threw some words down without much thought or conviction to finish up the last three pages. While it did tie up the end of the story, it didn't feel as sincere or as filled with emotion as the rest of the novel."
2,Typical Chinese crap,"The bars are very sturdy: it was easy to assemble. However, the foam is falling apart after five uses and twists all over while doing pull-ups. The rubber strip, intended to protect the wall, started to fall off the bar shortly after using it. The end caps pop off. What can I say? Save your sixty dollars for something better. I bought a cheap doorway pull-up bar from Walmart, for less than half the cost, and have not had any issues with it."
3,Good but not Great,"When I opened the box to put this together it did have rust on it. It did clean up easily and did not have damage to the bar itself. The rust was apparently from the warehouse and clean up envolved just a quick wipe down. My 12 year old son put it together that was not difficult. The foam padding that contacts the door frame it not enough and has split with just three weeks of use. This has caused damage to my door frame. I had to put more padding on this portion of the bar. The function of the bar is good, solid and offers a variety of hand hold positions."
4,nice,"Solid product, easy to assemble, materials will last a long time.heavy duty.Will definately mark the doorframe if it's white.I would recommend putting some towels at the stress points to prevent marking.If anything my doorframe is too weak as it acts as a lever and the frame creaks every time I do a pullup. I have a metal doorframe, not sure if a wood doorframe would be better or worse.overall the best product in it's class I would buy again"
4,it is what it is...,"Ive had this thing about a year and do about 150 pullups once per week. I use the outter grips for about 65-70 pullups and the narrow for about the same. I use a palms forward grip and try not to torque out the grips but they, never the less have begun to fall apart now. The inner ones are still ok for now but the outter ones are both torn.The unit itself has not bent or broken and for the amount of use I give it (my friend does about 75 with me while I do mine most weeks) it has more than paid for itself. Just buy some bicycle grips that go on with alcohol so when it dries they are on tight and you should be fine. Also, make sure that your door frame works with its width. Mine was fine but another friend of mine that I got into pullups had to have a pipe cut to extend each side by about 3 inches for his door frame.Overall, buy it... its worth the money if you use it... and remember, real men do pullups!!! so just shut up and do em'"
2,"Good, but be cautious","Good:Sound and sturdy design.Bad:Build quality - Excessive glue on the catch bar, get ready with your WD40 for cleanup. Four out of 6 comfort grips were not adhered to the bars properly (turning at the ends), making them difficult to get a firm grip. White paint chipped in a couple of places.Other:Assembly instructions are confusing, but it's not too difficult to figure it out from the pictures.Only 1 inch diameter bar with very thin grip pads make it uncomfortable for adults. If I didn't have a kid, I would have returned this product."
4,"Good value, does the job.","This item is very sturdy and easy to use once assembled. I like the multiple hand positions and the angled wide grip. The instructions for assembly are almost useless - fortunately it's pretty simple to put together. It took me about 1/2 hour. Make sure your doorway is 30"" wide or less, or it won't mount at all. If you have white molding, use a towel or some other non-marking pad between the black foam and door frame to avoid black divots.Overall, this product was exactly as advertised. Of course getting myself to use it as more than just a dry cleaning rack is the real challenge."
4,Good device,"If the instructions were a little better I would have given it 5 stars.The instructions say you need 2 9/16 reches (yes spelled that way). I found I needed a 1/2 a 9/16 and I think the last was 9/11. Otherwise it went together very quickly.The only complaint I have with the Doorway Gym is it's too small for my door way. With the molding, my doors are about 8 inches thick. When hung the Doorway Gym, the part that goes against the wall on the top of the door is at an angle. Since it's not seated properly, it's not wise to use it. Otherwise I am really happy with it.I'm probably going to attach it to a beam in my garage and use it there."
2,Finally Assembled,I agree with the other review. After I dusted the rust off I tried to assemble it. It came with nutlocks which I had never used before. You have to hold down the bolt with one tool while tightening the nutlock with another. It should eventually tighten for you. After I finally assembled it I liked the product.
4,learned alot,This is a biography for kids on Jackie Robinson. He was a famous African american baseball player. He had to work really hard and ignore rude comment from many fans. Most people in his days did not like black and whites playing together. He took the bad and pushed it aside and became a better person and player!The book was not too long and not too short. It contained the right amount of information for kids.I would recommend this book to kids who are learning about the Jackie Robinson. I learned a lot from reading this book. He is a great role model for kids today.
5,Haha!,"Can you go wrong with Doug n Carey? This is a classic and good comedy. Enjoy! Makes a great gift, too!"
5,Excellent service at a busy time of year,Thanks for the timely service and delivery of the King of Queens--The Complete Third Season. We had no stressful moments wondering if it would arrive before Christmas. Excellent job!
5,FINALLY!!!,I have been waiting for the third season release for months. It is the best show ever and i cant wait for this release!!!
4,Uniden phone,We just purchased a set of 4 Uniden DCT 646 phones. We are very happy with their performance and our purchase.
1,uniden phone,"I gave this item 1 star because Ace Digital is the seller and they sent me the wrong phone, didn't check into getting me the correct phone and after 3 phone calls to them to try to order the correct phone, I just bought it somewhere else. Then upon returning the phone to Ace Digital, they tried to charge ME for the shipping!"
3,Wrong item,"HiThe item sent was NOT the exact item i requested and i didnt have time to mess with this. Very dissappointed. If it was suppose to interact with the item I requested, it did notGlad you sent this to me"
1,It DIED,"Was great at first, I gave it 5 stars. My last remark in my review was were see how it holds up WELL IT DIDN'T.You get what you pay for"
4,Great Phone,"I am very happy with this phone - the range is perfect for my needs, reaching to every part of my house and even down the driveway to the mailbox. My only complaint (and the reason for not giving it 5 stars) is that when you receive a call on one handset, it registers as a missed call on the other handsets - as well, when you clear the missed calls from the memory of one handset, it does not clear it from the other handsets. Not necessarily a deal breaker, just a mild annoyance as I periodically have to go around to each receiver to clear out the memory. But otherwise, the features are great, it is comfortable to hold and use and is just what I had hoped it would be."
2,Great quality but it doesn't last long,"I bought it just a year ago. Great audio and great battery length. After a year only one of the three headsets has audio coming in. If someone calls and you press ""talk"" on the other two headsets, you will not hear anything but the person on the other line will hear you. Disappointed."
5,MY Phone,My phone has always been a bother to me as I do not hear well. This new Uniden 646 has made talking on the phone again a pleasure. Sound is great and the distance is unreal. Thanks Uniden
4,Very interesting history with computer remodeling of Jerusalem,This documentary has better quality than A&E's Ancient Mysteries: The Lost Ark of Covenant. And this has computer remodeling of ancient Jerusalem and the temples along with its very interesting history. You can see mostly from Israel's side though.
3,Over the Top?,"It's hard to know what to say about this book. It includes research abstracts and practical advice about incorporating wheat grass juice into your diet, but it comes close to attributing mystical properties to wheat grass, which seems to me to be a little over the top. If you are thinking of buying this book, it is probably because you or someone close to you has cancer or some other serious health problem. If you want to add wheat grass juice to a good nutrition plan and good medical care, this book will be helpful. If you are looking for a magic bullet or a miracle cure, this book might convince you that you've found it."
4,Excellent source of information,"If you have ever been curious about wheat grass then this is a very good book. It's now the rage at all the juice bars even at the mall. The book explains the different types of grass, why one is better than another and what to avoid. I now have a much sharper eye and always demand to see the wheat grass before it gets pressed. I avoid the juice bars with ignorant kids working at them because they don't know what they are doing and so why waste my time. It's not preachy and I also appreciate that too."
3,curious about wheatgrass,I was curious as to what the wheatgrass deal was all about & the book certainly covers the subject in detail.
3,rather remedial,"This book seemed a bit basic and remedial to me. I'm in my mid-twenties and I have read a few motivational books. This one is filled with advice that is very general and obvious. The book might be helpful for someone in their late teens to early twenties. For anyone who has a fair amount of job and dating experience, the book is rather useless."
4,Second Saturday's Comments,"Second Saturday Book Club absolutely loved this game! It was a lot of fun, fast paced and interesting; would recommend to ALL book clubs!"
3,Engine that rocks from side to side on tracks.,I got this engine a few days ago.When I got it on the tracks and started moving it on the tracks it came off.It also is not a steady engine.It stableiles it when I hitch freight cars to it. It also is not built like a regular Thomas engine.It has a peice of plastic on the bottom of it.All in all I think it is pretty good.
4,Nice while it lasted,I loved these trains but after 5 yrs of wear and tear from a little boy you'll notice that they ship paint and get dins easily good for someone who will be a bit more careful with them and use for show only
4,Stunning novel of aerial combat,"Stunning, detailed, novel of aerial combat, life, love and loss covering 2 decades and 3 wars. Spanish, WW2, Korean. Carefully avoids taking sides so that reader can emphatise with both heroic protagonists. The enormous amount of detailed air combat is a must for war and warbird fans. Superbly written, brilliant characterization and action from beginning to end"
2,14 missing songs; CD contains 24.1 mins not 42,"The voices are pleasant, but the CD omits 14 songs at the end. Then again, I got it for $6.63."
4,Fabulous but a bit long,Superb. Depiction of the time and the Australia of which we wish had a personal memory but that we have a common nostalgia for. And a good story too.
4,Good read,This book was my favorite of the first two. You can get a good idea of what book one is about just by reading this one.
5,"DITTO to Washington, DC reviewer",Couldn't say it any better. You'll listen to this CD over and over again and continue to enhance your appreciation for Xavier's burgundy velvet voice.
4,The singer that made Berlin sufferable,"I am a Black American who was raised on Soul, R&B; and Gospel, I know good singing. I was in Berlin studying for a year and was depressed by the R&B;/Hip-hop music scene. The German hip-hop did leaave me with much to be desired. However I would be remiss if I did say that my grasp of the German language is poor.Nonetheless, I happened to be over at a friends house who had T.V and saw Mr. Naidoo. I must say his voice is strong and rich. He definantly sings from his souls and his emotions are raw and open. I was captivated and instantly fell in love with his artistry. I cannot compare Mr. Naidoo to another artist, because he envelopes many qualities of 60's soul artists. Everyone should buy this record!!!"
5,BRILLIANT,"I first heard Xavier's voice while I was visiting my father in Frankfurt, Germany. I was stunned. I don't speak german, and still I'm moved by this album. Every song is so interesting...I've never heard anything like them. There are soulful ballads, and a share of head bobbing tracks...something for every mood. I hope that Xavier will come out with an album in English, because he NEEDS to be introduced to the States. He has been blessed with a very powerful voice, not to mention amazing songwriting skills, especially for a man so young. One of my favorite cds. Get it, even if you don't understand German! p.s. his live album has the most beautiful song 'bis an di sterne' :0)"
5,Xavier's voice is da'ish,"I don't have the cd yet, but I wish to purchase it. I lived in Germany for four years and every time I heard one of Xavier's songs I cried, his music has the perfect harmony. The words just run way to short when thinking of this man's awesome voice, I know he has other albums and I wish there was some way to get ahold of them because in Germany you can only by the records, and with today's technology I certainly don't have a record player laying around. When I first heard his music I didn't know what any of his songs meant, and I thought they were beautiful, but while in Germany I took the language in school for three years and they are even more meaningful than I ever thought. Anyone no matter what kind of music you listen to will love this cd, especially young women!"
5,Vocals from Heaven,"This CD is one of the best any German vocalist has ever produced. Rythmic, soulful and with an incredible voice, Xavier Naidoo speaks of life, his beliefs, love. This CD has touched me in deep ways. Musically, the quality is impeccable. I would recommend it to anyone who wants more than a mushy pop song, woman bashing rap and hip hop or whining Country. One of my all time favorites!"
1,Another Product Ruined by Improvement,"I was dismayed to find the ""King Size"" Snickers bars are now two small pieces with an anemic layer of chocolate, and half the flavor of the former King Size Snickers bar. Always bought the king size; the chocolate was thicker and the whole thing just had more flavor, because it was loaded with peanuts and caramel. Really felt like you got your money's worth, which is becoming increasingly rare. Unfortunately, it appears Snickers has jumped on the bandwagon of charging more for less, and now is trying to pass off an inferior item as a ""king size"" candy bar, hoping the customers will play along. Another terrific product bites the dust."
3,OK Cream,"I was interested in this creme because I love grape seed oil products.It is lightly scented with a fragrance that I like more on some days than others.The consistency is good -- Semi-thick & absorbs quickly so your hands immediately feel moisturized.Except on my bare nails, I don't like the resulting shiny look.The large jar container makes it less than convenient in terms of portability."
2,Sloppy,"Notwithstanding Jeff's mantra that flawless grammar and orthography are essential features of successful writers (i.e., attention to detail), it is amazing how sloppy this book is. It boasts incorrect addresses, incomplete addresses, and sometimes, in the agent profiles sections, the ""Subjects that you would most love to agent"" and ""Subjects that you definitely never want to agent"" sections contain the same thing! According to page 536, for example, fantasy and science fiction are both subjects that Peter Rubie would ""most love to agent"" and ""definitely never want to agent."" Either the agent is schizophrenic, or Jeff Herman is an extraordinarily sloppy writer. Also, this book features almost no valuable information on query letters for fiction books; this book seems to assume that all aspiring authors want to write non-fiction."
3,A huge reference with no index and a tiny TOC.,"The first thing I did when I got this book was go to the back of the book - I wanted to look up ""children's authors"" or something to that affect. Much to my chagrin, there is NO INDEX. Ok, so I go to the front to the TOC (Table Of Contents). It's 2 pages long. And the agents aren't broken down in any user-friendly way. I wanted to see something like ""Literary Agents - Children""; Literary Agents - Fiction"", etc. Any huge reference guide like this should have a more comprehensive TOC, and an INDEX. I don't know about other writers, but doing the administrative tasks needed to get published is far more painstaking than writing, and you want to get the information you need as quickly and easily as possible, without having to hunt and peck to get what you need. I think the editors of this book got lazy, which makes this book a disappointment."
1,2006 Edition of limited value,I had been using the 13th edition of Jeff Hermann's writer's guide. I found it quite useful and relied on the index heavily. Since 2002 many of the addresses were no longer up-to-date. I purchased the 2006 edition to get more recent information. To my dismay I discovered that the 2006 Edition has no index whatever! An 806 page guide with no index is of limited value to me.
4,Provides part of the equation,"This book, along with others, tell a lot about the publishing procedure. After reading this book and the others, I feel it is worthwhile to do publishing as an e-book, then if it catches on after proper marketing, then the publishers will want it."
4,Good Information,"This guide is unique in that it gives all the detail of Literary Agents and Publishers in a friendly, relaxed Chit-chat format.Very complete and thorough."
2,blaming both sides for the Cold War,"This book, written some years ago by an old friend and mentor, now deceased, was a disappointment. Bob Bathurst used to teach that the Russians needed to be understood in a cultural way so that we could understand the Soviets strategically. But here he argues that American and Russian cultural ""coding"" prevented either side from really understanding the other, and in fact allowed each side to create the enemy in the other. In short, a relativistic view of the Cold War. The author displays an impressive understanding of the glories and idiosyncracies of Russian culture--except for the Orthodox Church, which he seems to misunderstand completely--but his view of American culture is wholly negative. For example, he laments that American culture, being ""oriented to the present"" and subject to rapid ""personnel turnover,"" lacks the sort of ""institutional memory"" the Russians have. Well, yes, democratic elections do that."
5,Birds of Southern Africa,Book was purchased for our forthcoming trip to Botswana. It seems to give excellent coverage of the birdswe're likely to encounter there and with little repetition of birds we've seen before in Kenya and Tanzania.The maps are well done and illustrations are excellent.
4,Well presented field guide for identification,"The size of the book is appropriate for carrying in the field. The narrative is concise and well presented. The pictures of the birds are easy to reference. The real test of a field guide, though, is how useful it is when there is an unidentified bird in front of you. I will not know that until I get back from S. Africa in March but this book appears comparable to the better guides for US birds."
1,Cream of tartar is NOT tartaric acid...,I haven't purchased this product but wanted to post because it is misleading.Cream of tartar is the salt of tartaric acid. Cream of tartar is used for baking. If you are trying to make mascarpone cheese you need tartaric acid!
1,tartaric acid and cream of tartar,"Tartaric acid and cream of tartar are not the same thing. Cream of tartar is made from tartaric acid. It is a weak salt derived from tartaric acid, when it is half-neutralized with potassium hydroxide.In most home recipes that call for tartaric acid can substitute 2 tsp cream of tartar for 1tsp tartaric acid. But if you are buying tartaric acid, you are not looking for cream of tartar and the seller should not label cream of tartar as tartaric acid."
2,Too Technical For What I needed,"We own a professional handyman service in Scottsdale, AZ and thought this might be handy to keep in the trucks. However, the information in this book is so technical, it is of no real use on a day-to-day basis. If you need to know (and even know that you need to know) the distance across squares and hexagons OR Maximum Horizontal Roof Rafter Spans, then this is the book for you. Otherwise stick to the practical books you can get at Home Depot or Lowes."
2,Way Over My Head,"The ""handyman"" must be an engineer and you need to be one too! I was really disappointed as I was hoping for a ""how to"" manual. The are literally hundreds and hundreds of tables of, for me, totally useless numbers and specs. I don't even have any friends who might find this level of technical detail useful that I could give the book to. This is NOT the resource for your everyday handyman/woman."
4,Charlie,"When they say back pocket they mean small. Packed with tons of information, but very small print. May need microscope."
5,dramatic and compassionate,"These compelling narratives span post WWII Europe to contemporary USA -- the speaker, raised in a convent in Europe traces her life in the cruel environment of the convent to her married life here in this country. The poems are of daily life -- its joys and horrors. They are generous poems, long and meandering. They are accessible, always. Funny, sweet, scary and sumptuous."
3,Good Selection,"Contains an excellent collection of short stories, from Hawthorne to Faulkner. There are all varieties of writing styles, from authors of various backgrounds... A very solid textbook all 'round.This is also one of those few cases where I feel led to comment on the make of the book. I think they used Elmer's glue to make the binding. A book should be able to take a minor level of bumping around in a backpack without falling to pieces."
1,"did not fit, even though size was correctly displayed","I have always worn this size in this exact model Rockies jeans, but these were obviously mis-sized since they did not fit at all.I had to send them back."
1,This book on a CD is very poor in quality and content.,"After receiving the CD, there are no real written instructions included - other than to put it into your cd driver, locate the index.html file and open it with Netscape Navigator. The author uses a non-standard font - which is not embedded on the CD and is hard to read. The content is for beginners to Web development. The information under the JAVA button, does not exist - it is not on the CD-ROM and Netscape could not find it on the Web. I have returned this CD and cannot recommend it to others. If there was a choice for the rating to be 0 stars, I would give it that rating."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Your Money,"The battery position makes this plane ""nose heavy "" and ours never did get off the ground. In addition, the small nuts which hold the rear landing gear loosen up due to the vibration which could lead to losing the wheel. As ""first time"" R/C enthusiasts, we were very disappointed by the performance of this plane."
3,Good for the $$$,This is a good plane to learn on although it must be flown in zero wind. It is underpowered so care must be taken to gain altitude before attempting any tight turns.
1,"North Carolina ,CH",I purchased the Cosmic Flyer and it didn't fly at all. I tried to make adjustment to the aircraft the very next day and it still didn't fly. Each time I tried to fly it went straight to the ground. A waste of money.
2,2 channels are not enough!,Easy enough to fly and do so in a VERY large field on a very calm day.Turns done at low altitude readily lead to spins and crashesControls let you climb with motor power and make left and right turns that readily turn into spins.I have crashed plenty as a part of my learning and now I want at least a 3 channel and preferably a 4 channel planeLack of proportional controls means turns are done with small corrective left rights otherwise it is spin and crash city.Thick clear packing tape repairs most of the damage done on the foam wings and tail
1,Waste of time,This plane is a waste of money it goes up then comes straight back down to the ground. I tried sorting it out but it still wont work. A waste of money in my mind
1,Criminally Unfunny!,"I purchased this because I saw a couple of reviews stating how hilarious it was. Of course tastes differ, but this was NOT funny at all; just creepy! The writers seem to be straining to be shocking and irreverent; believe me, they failed on both counts.There is NOT ONE FUNNY SCENE! I have always thought myself as one with a sort of dark, quirky sense of humor (I always loved The Far Side and cartoons by Gahan Wilson), but this was not even remotely funny. After FORCING myself to sit through the first disc, I felt like taking a shower. I wanted to return it, but it wasn't the seller's fault that the show is not funny, so I'll donate the set to a charity."
1,"Self-impressed new age of ""actor-comedians""","Smart-alecky efforts with the same sarcastic and insipid attitudes found in many Comedy Channel programs. Lame-brained antics by today's Liberal Zombie wasteoids.Some funny bits, but verrry repetitive and not really that good.People might consider raising their standards."
3,Not sure they know what they're talking about...,"I did find this book helpful for bread baking tips, but as far as teaching a thing or two about how to adjust recipes for high altitude, I haven't really found what I need. It talks about some differences in baking at high altitude and sea level, but doesn't show you how to adjust other recipes to make up for the differences. Maybe I just can't find it? I also made cupcakes from this book and cupcakes from a non-high-altitude cookbook and the ones from this book were dense, hard and icky. I live at over 5,000 feet and thought these recipes would work better here than average recipes."
2,Don't bother.,"Me and my wife moved to Colorado from sea level, and were big bakers using Betty Crocker baking books. We have tried many of the recipes in this book and have yet to come across one that tastes even halfway decent. We live at 9100 feet, and there are many recipes in the book that don't require any further adjustments for higher altitudes (so they say), and we've tried a few of the cake and cookie recipes, but none of them worked, the cakes flopped,and the cookies always flattened out completely. It was hit or miss with this book, and that's aside from the awful taste of the recipes. They claim that all the recipes will work to 6500 ft elevation, and higher altitudes require further changes, but even making the changes they have in the book under the recipe's, a lot of the recipes failed.Save your money and get any baking book and make adjustments for high altitude, using any of the adjustments you can readily find on-line for your altitude.We were very disappointed in this cookbook."
2,"Good, but.....","This is a pretty good movie. The live stuff is the higlight here, and it is really great. The highlight would have to be the segue of different versions of ""Action Man"". However, there is a lot of needless stuff here: interviews that don't say much (like clips of the band at a baseball game or at a Star Trek store????) and some other stuff that they should have left out. The studio footage is pretty good, but is shot in a very odd sort of home-movie style. I would have just released most of the Red Rocks concert. This is Ok, but it would have been better if they would have just gone with the live footage."
5,A must read!,A must read for anyone who flies. Commendable research and insight into the airline industry and FAA. Very insightful!
3,Finger-holes too small; Great blades.,"The finger holes are a bit too small. So if you have medium to large hands, these might not be for you. Good blades, though."
1,Borke,Did not last. Only worked for 1 month and now I can't use it anymore. I should expect it since it is so cheap
2,A wasted of money!!!,"A real waste of money, never worked with a sd card and my laptop never recognized, not recommended at all!!!"
5,Used worked fine,"We have used this to transfer images from 8Gb SD memory cards to an older laptop that has no SD slot. We like it and decided to purchase another, one to keep with the camera, and one to keep in the laptop case."
1,Um....,"Unless I got a defective product this is horrible...my images got lines in through them and become blurred during transfer, very disappointing purchase."
1,I thought they were good...but one year later,"I am copying a pile of discs after originally burning about a year ago. All went fine until I hit the Philips. Now I had copied these about 4 or 5 months ago and they were fine. Now 3 out of 5 failed with errors. I am wondering if thelong term storage properties of these are compromised.They do play fine in DVD players, but wonder how long that will be if secotrs are going bad."
1,non sense,First of all you don't have a picture of these DVD's and second of all you don't have a price and third of all you don't tell how many. Too many screwups between -'s and +'s
3,below my expectations,I was very excited to purchase a hands-on numeric toy but it's rather boring. it's conceptual but below my expectations.
4,Engaging,"I have read this title several times over the years and borrowed from my local library, but finally figured I needed my own copy. The author and his dog travel from Texas to California and back quite a few times thumbing rides and taking their chances. A really on-the-road story and how to book but never one where you feel sorry for their lack of funds or sometimes dire circumstances. I've continued to keep in touch with him on Facebook and light a candle to his shrine for his dog who made this tale one of great companionship and courage."
4,A surprisingly engaging account of homelessness,"I don't often read non-fiction, but I was enchanted by Travels with Lizbeth by Lars Eighner. It's about three years in the life of a homeless man and his dog. Before being on the streets he was a writer/mental health worker (he wrote gay porn, among other things, to make money). His style is really remarkable-mannered and wry. It's as though he were educated at Oxford and one day found himself on the streets of Austin, TX without any prospects to speak of. His adventures are poignant, funny, tragic, and even occasionally sexy. You'll walk away with an appreciation for a category of homelessness, the situationally homeless, that often gets overlooked. We're always quick to categorize people on the streets as either: substance abusers, mentally ill, or simply homeless by choice. But some people just lose it. Eighner loses it, but ultimately makes the most of it. When I finished the book, I just wanted to send him money in case his luck had changed again"
1,Never received it!!!!!,"I haven't received my order till this day it has been a month and nothing yet. Sad to say but it has been a bad purchase. Also I have email the vendor and havent heard an answer yet, I think that is the least they can do, to write back. Dissapointed."
1,Why Troma WHY!?,"So, I love Troma...Love it, with all my heart but why did they stamp their endorsement on this? It's an inspection of a series of twisted individuals who get their hands on this dumpster baby throughout the movie, a metaphor to the corrupton of our society....that's quite the lofty goal but the result is pure garbage. I hate it so much I needed to rub ajax on my eyes with steel wool.Stick with Toxie, SGT Kabukiman NYPD, Nukem High, Tromeo and Juliet, Troma War, Terror Firmer, and Poultrygeist (Those are all the ones I've liked best, but there's a few more I haven't seen)"
2,With all due respect: boring,"I respect John Adams as a composer. He has done wonderful things, which are ultimately moving. But this CD is boring. Once you leave the violin behind, and in spite of the cute titles, all sounds pretty much the same. For those who want it, nothing more than an intellectual exercise."
3,color in fun,Coloring book format so not very creative. Interesting designs but no written info re: mandalas
5,finger puppets,looked great on my diaper cake made for a baby shower. Product came quickly and was so cute I purchase again.;
4,Dr. Seuss Cat in the Hat Boxed Set,"We bought this as a decor item for a baby room, not really to be used as a toy. They are very cute."
5,Not just for Home Schoolers!,"I am a busy working mom, but I am engaged in my children's lives. I learned about Susan Bauer's work from home schoolers in my area. Although I am not a home schooler, I used this book to help engage my children in history. My daughters (age 7 and 4) loved this book. We spent about 30 minutes every week reading a chapter and doing an activity. They were loved the stories. We completed the book in 11 months. They frequently asked if we could do more than one chapter. It is such vivid writing. This was a great investment."
4,great idea and very useful but some misinformation,"This is a great way to introduce a child to history. It is well-written and easy to read aloud. The book include facts and stories in just the right measure for a child to easily understand. Questions are put forth to get children thinking about history and the stories. I would say that there should have been a section on the Hittites since so much is dedicated to Egyptian civilization (just think of the Kadesh Treaty). And while it is certain that the Emperor Constantine's mother was a Christian, there is no proof that he ever became a Christian. There is also the impression given that the Biblical stories are the same as history. My son loved it and I will buy the next two volumes but I will balance the information in the book with my own knowledge."
5,Great Book,"I really like Susan Wise Bauer's books. At first I thought it was a little too juvenile with all of her explanations and how she presents some of the topics, but as I've watched my children and their retention on the information, I am second guessing my first assumption. This is very easy to read and understand."
5,"If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!","My children BEG for history lessons! Ms. Bauer and Mr. Weiss have created a masterpiece here. Ms. Bauer's history stories are compelling and easy for kids to follow. We have the book version of this as well, and read stories from it regularly. Mr. Weiss does have a ""liquid gold"" quality to his voice, and we really enjoy listening to him."
4,good overall,"overall, I like this book...the story type history is very readable for children- to them and also by them independently. But I think that the time periods covered in the book are not put together well...they jump all over in time instead of following an organized time line."
4,Very good history curriculum,"We originally purchased this audio book to supplement the hard copy we were using as our history curriculum. We ended up changing history curriculia, but still used the CD's. Not only are we Susan Wise Bauer fan's, but we are also fans of Jim Weiss. We eventually just used these as 'story tapes'.I didn't give the product 5 starts because there is only little aspect that is annoying to us. In the hard copy text Dr. Bauer would add a note at the bottom of a page called ""Note To Parent"". The audio book version includes these notes. So, while Mr. Weiss is reading he will suddenly sayd ""Note to parent"". This was very distracting for us."
4,too fast!,"I have the Story of the World book and workbook, and I thought having it on CD might be nice for the car. I have very much enjoyed the smooth voice of Jim Weiss in several other story cds I have by him. So it made sense to try this one.Sadly, Jim sounds rushed in this cd. I think that kids will just space out much of what he says, because there are so many facts packed in at such a fast pace. I wish he would have taken his time, and ambled through history at a leisurely pace rather than the slightly tense and frenzied reading that he has done here. I felt compelled to take rushed notes, and stop and replay - not appropriate for this age!"
5,The Story of the World leaves students begging for more!,"The Story of the World not only gives readers a wonderful story, it also provides vivid pieces of history through the characters. This book is a very readable narrative that tells the story of ancient times by balancing a massive amount of history with solid characterization. From page to page there is a genuine flavor of the period and of the people who made it what it was.The Curriculum Guide and Activity Book has many hands-on projects for children of all ages. These projects range from coloring pages, to maps, to crafts and games. Each lesson provides many activities to choose from. I highly recommend The Story of the World and its curriculum guide!Elementary School Teacher andFormer Professor of ReadingUniversity of Mary Hardin-Baylor"
2,"My children are little people, not simpletons","This book is written in such a patronizing way that I couldn't even stand to read it to schedule lessons. I let my children (9, 8, & 7) look through it, and they informed me that they would not do it for school because it was obviously ""a book for babies"". I could have enjoyed the book with them if it hadn't been for the condescending voice in which it was written. Granted, the older and younger kids read on a much higher level, but even my middle child who reads only at grade level didn't want anything to do with the book.Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn't suggest it unless you plan to do a lot of supplemental reading and/or ad-libbing a less patronizing version as you ""read"" aloud to your child."
1,A very poor example of history to show young people.,"Ms. Bauer should have the courage of her convictions, and call this book what it is - little more than a children's Bible. To call it the story of the world is dishonest.The religions of the ancient Greeks, Romans and Egyptians are referred to as myths, Hinduism is trashed as nothing more than an evil caste system, while she treats the parting of the Red Sea, the virgin birth and the resurrection of Jesus as historical fact.On top of this, the book is not even well written. It is patronizing, judgmental, extremely subjective, and what's with all the exclamation points?This book is going in the garbage where it belongs."
5,My Ivy League-bound daughter wishes she had read them...,"We began homeschooling when our oldest daughter was in 7th grade and did our best to thoroughly cover American History before sending her off to high school. When she was a sophomore in high school taking the World History AP class, she would listen to me read this series of history books to her much younger sisters and comment about how much easier her life would have been in that class had she had the background that her sisters were getting. She earned the highest possible score on the World History AP test that year and the American History AP test the next year and is now bound for the Ivy League. She is my best resource for knowing if we are thoroughly covering the bases and would definitely give SOTW a thumbs-up rating. She also would add that Joy Hakim's ""A History of US"" is the way to go for U.S. history."
2,Sorely disappointed,"I simply wanted to agree with Mr. Griffin's review below. The emphasis is also way too much on Biblical, canonical history with only minimal multicultural links. Does not follow her other books' philosophical principles. Editing indifferent. Looks like an attempt (successful) to get a product out there for a seller's market. Better books exist, even in single volume."
3,Boring for 9-year old,"We took this CD on a road trip with our 9-year-old son. He thought it was boring and very repetitive. Because of this, he was not willing to listen to it. I am sure that there is very useful and interesting information in the book, but perhaps it is more appropriate for a younger child."
2,Confuses historical study with religious studies,I was disappointed to discover that this book was written from a religious perspective. I thought I was ordering a professionally written history but discovered a writer who assumed that the reader was a theist. Religious legend is not distinguished from historical fact. I don't want my daughter to be confused by such a muddle of information.I wish that the author would've put the Christian perspective somewhere in the title so the buyer would be informed of this before purchasing.
5,Great History for Children!,This is a great history program for children. The information just about the right length for the younger children and leaves out just enough to make the older ones want more. So that they can go look up more information on there own.
4,Great learning experience for elementary level kids!,A friend recommended that we check out this audio book series on World History. She uses it as part of her curriculum for home schooling her kids. We thought it would be a great thing to try in the car while driving around town. What a great series! It is so quiet in our car that you could hear a pin drop. Our 3 boys are elementary age and ate it up. The stories are very interesting and are just the right amount of detail on history for this age. My kids are begging me to buy the second volume already!
2,Liked the format and presentation - not the facts,"I was looking for a history book as I homeschool my daughter. I was very happy with the workbook format and projects as well as history presented in chronological order. As I am not a history scholar, I was enjoying learning the history along with my daughter up until I was reading her chapter on Christianity. Being a Christian who has studied much of the bible, I am familiar with a good amount of these facts. Some of the facts she presents are so wrong that now I question many of the facts she presents from other cultures. If you are looking for an easy read and presentation of different cultures this book is good. I will continue thru the series as I do like certain things about it, however, I am now aware of its weakness and will use other books to supplement the fact presented so the information will be more accurate."
1,Fundamentally Flawed,"I'm not even going to get into how bad this book needs a copy editor. It reads like it was rushed (far prematurely) into print.This book was so bad that it made me view all the other Wise/Bauer works through a new, gimlet eye.I have edited this review extensively, because having thought it over, I think that this book's premise is a poor one after all. I think that it reads disjointedly and muddles facts because it skips around so much- it reads like ""Here's five chapters on the Middle East. Meanwhile, over in China...""I think that it makes more sense to study the history of a particular culture, nation, or area. In other words, use geography as the spine. Trying to tell what was going on all over the world during any given year (or century) is going to be haphazard most of the time."
3,Great read-aloud!,"May not be historically accurate, but still enjoyable. My kids enjoyed the stories and also benefitted from the Activity Guide. I have loaned out my books to several homeschooling families."
2,A good idea not so well executed,"As another reviewer noted ""Many things are presented as facts that are actually storytelling"". Among other noted inaccuracies, the author offers up bible stories as ""history"". Other readers might find this acceptable but I most certainly do not. This book is going in the paper recycling bin."
5,Great set for my homeschool family,I just received this book and the activity book and they are great. This is amazing and I can already tell it will make teaching my 8 and 9 year old history a lot more fun! The two books work together beautifully and it really works with both student and teacher. Wonderful and I will be using this set exclusively for History.
5,Wonderful history for the family,A very nice introduction to history for my 4 year old daughter. The chapters are broken into small sections. The story examples are colorful and realistic. A great find.
2,so-so retelling of legends,"I really wanted to like this book. I like the idea of it much more than the book itself. We're ten chapters in and both the kids and I are losing interest fast. It reads like a Grimm's fairy tale written by a middle school student. At least half the text is comprised of stories and not history. The stories are rather dark for my sensitive first grader. I find myself skipping large sections of text and having to edit what I do read aloud. The writing is overly simplified and seems patronizing, even for very young children, and contains frequent typos. I had planned on using this as the basis of our homeschool history for this year but am now looking for an alternative. I will still read the rest of the book to the kids before selling it but plan on continuing to skip many of the stories and just read the meat of the text."
2,just OK,"I am a homeschooler and I find the story of the world to be adequate but not impressive. If you are not a Christian you will like that she leaves much of the Biblical world view out of the text. Man just shows up on the scene. There is reference to some historical figures that are also Biblical figures but its hard to tell if she is telling these as stories or truth. Technically, some of the stories are out of order, which makes it difficult to teach when you are trying to stay with the timeline. There are some factual errors, which other reviewers have also detailed. Her distinctions between stories for illustration and truth are very blurred so it begins to sound like the whole thing is a fable. Its fun for the kids to listen to, but I wouldn't use it as my core curriculum by any means."
1,Not based on facts!!,"I borrowed this book from a friend who also homeschools and I'm glad I did before purchasing it. I started skimming through it and saw so many (authors)opinions that I didn't even consider wasting my time reading the book thoroughly. When I read that ""Nero was the worst emporer in the history of Rome"" and that the ""Romans HATED Jesus"", I was really put off by the opinionated views, as well as the negativity. I want to teach my children how to form their own opinions about the history of the world and other subjects as well, this is exactly why I took them out of school. If your looking for a book that is a factal account of world history this is not the book for you. She should have titled the book ""My Opinion of the Story of the World""."
3,Very good History book with one major defect: NO PICTURES,"This is a wonderful and very well written book. Its prose is very appealing, but it has a major defect: it lacks pictures. I have a 7 year old child who loves to read and be read. He likes all kinds of books, especially History..., but he also likes to see pictures when he reads. He likes to see the different coffins where a pharoh was put in after his death, he likes to see the shaddur to understand how it works, and so on. In order that I read from this book, I have to promise him that we will read from the Usborne World History immediately after. If he is to chose, he would only read the Usborne World History. (sorry for my grammar, English is my second language)"
2,"Glorifies man, ignores God's Hand in History","Right from the beginning, with the ""definition"" of history you are given the author's world view. History is treated as a series of facts, events, and people-thereby glorifying man and his knowledge and successes APART from a Providential view of history which recognizes God's Hand in history- properly defined has His Story!As for the writing style-the narrative is most appropriate for early elementary. The narrative is engaging for that age set and could be self read, though it lends itself to a read-aloud.Overall, this volume is inappropriate for a Christian home educator. I would look into something from Foundation for American Christian Education, Mantle Ministries, Beautiful Feet Books or the like in lieu."
2,Let's be honest,"If you want your child to grow up to be politically correct, this book will help. To be unable to distinguish between fact and legend is essential; otherwise, when your child is presented with more explicitly political material at a later age, he/she may well question it or even demand proof.However, if you do not want your child to develop a habit of accepting unquestioningly what she/he is taught, you will want to avoid this book and the many others like it."
2,Not for younger children,"Now, keep in mind that I have not read the book and have no idea how good it is for older children. This is specifically for younger children. I bought this book to read aloud to my 5 year old thinking it would be a fun way to introduce her to ancient cultures in our homeschool. Boy, was I surprised when it arrived and it was just a normal sized paperback with no pictures! It is not something that any but the most cerebral 5 year old would sit through. So it will sit on my shelf collecting dust until she is ready for it. Also, considering that it is just a paperback with no pictures it is really not worth the price even for older kids. Maybe grab it from your local library, but don't buy it."
3,So-so,My nine-year-old son thought that this was boring. Very repetitive and talks down to a kid. Kind of patronizing.
4,Excellente!,"The book is fabulous. It follows a great format in a chronological way. It has worked well with our timeline curriculum. I would reccomend this for any homeschooler who wants a smooth reading, creative, and fascinating look at history from a Christian slant. The workbook is a must, and keeps my kids occupied with coloring or word searches while I read the relevant text. More ideas than I could possibly use, which makes it easy to delve deeper into a subject, or skim over it, depending on the kids interest. I have read ahead out of pure interest to me!"
5,Story of the World,"Story of the World by Susan Wise Bauer is incredible. It is an entertaining, informative, spectacular way, to a journey through history.My daughters ages 8 and 6 love to listen at home or in the car. I am drawn in to listening as well. Thanks!"
4,I laughed and I cried,"The story begins in 1928 and with the rape of the title character, Audrey Dickerson, by a drunk family friend. From page one I was drawn to Audrey's story--the birth of her illegitimate son, her struggles as a single mom.I was so facinated by Audrey I read this book in one night. Full of southern charm and loads of loveable southern characters, I was transported back to a simplier era, with strong family and moral values. Life was hard for Audrey and her kin but it was wonderful to read how they adapted to the challenges they faced with good ole fashion southern grit and integrity. I highly recommend this book."
5,Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce Flash Diffuser,"I bought this after being in a photography class. It fits my Olympus FL-50 flash perfectly. I leave it on all the time and I always use it. You can really tell a difference in the pictures. Its just a piece of plastic, but its worth it for under $20.00 shipped. Merry Christmas everyone!"
2,One size kinda fits all,"I bought this for the Sigma, which the description says is one of the flashes for which the diffuser is a fit. Well, it fits but kind of the same way you can squeeze into some pants from college. I waited too long to make a decision and should have returned it. The fit is so tight that I won't use it for fear of breaking the flash during removal.I suppose, like those jeans, I could leave it on for a bit and see if there is some beneficial stretching but, in both cases, the risk of damage probably outweighs the reward."
2,Sizes are way to small.,"the sizing of these are 2 sizes smaller then they are labeled, so if you wear a 12 better order a 16."
3,size is off,"I have been wearing this brand of jeans for a long time always purchased from Penneys, They do not sell them anymore. These ran a bit larger than theones I used to buy"
4,juwil,Does anyone understand like I do that women who wear petite sizes are not necessarily short. I love these jeans but why can't they make them in 4 petite with a 31 inch or 32 inch in seam. Just me thinking out aloud.
2,don't like Amandas,"Several years ago I bought 2 pr. of Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and loved them. They have about 3 in. of elastic on each side. They didn't have a name as far as I know. However, they were not Amanda and that's all I can find now. Can anyone help?"
1,They sent me the wrong item,Although this product was listed as a 17 inch hoop they mailed me a 12 inch hoop. Be cautious when ordering this item!
1,WRONG ONE,"I GUESS THEY WANT TO SEND WHAT EVER THEY FELL LIKE SENDING OR THEY CAN'T READ I GOT TWO 12""S WHEN I WAS TO GET TWO 17"" IF THEY DONT HAVE THE 17"" THEY SHOULD NOT LIST IT WHAT DO YOU THINK"
5,Fantastic Box Set!!!!,"I've been a salsa dj for about six years now and I have to say this is one of the best compilations I have ever come across. John Child, who put this collection together really knows his stuff and it shows. He's a regular contributor to descarga.com a well know webstie for hard to find latin music. This collection is a great introduction to different styles of salsa ranging from the 50's and 60's to present and not a single song in this collection dissapoints. If you are new to salsa and want a good starting point GET THIS BOX SET. Even for the most seasoned veteran and the most discerning ear, this collection will not dissapoint. Salsa instructors who are looking for something to recommend for your students...this is it, again you will not be dissapointed. Kudos to John Child from DJ Rod ""El Moreno De La Salsa"""
5,The essential guide to salsa,"Great value at a good cost. If you like salsa music this 3-CD set is a must!!!!! Initially, I received this CD as a gift and when I played it at a dinner party several of the guests loved it. One of them had a birthday coming up so I bought her the same 3-CD set.With Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, and Ruben Blades showcased how can you go wrong with great salsa music? From the first CD on Barrio Vibes, through Latin Giants and Island Roots you get close to three hours of great music."
5,Hilarious,This is such a cute book - it had the entire family laughing out loud. Viewing the world through a dog's eyes makes for great fun! Recommended for anyone ages 4 and up!
1,Rover,"This otherwise acceptable book is ruined by the referral to two people kissing as, ""Two people were trying to eat each other."" That may be a dog's-eye-view, but it's a disgusting image to convey to a young child. Children as young as four years old are in the stated age range for this book. Why would any parent or teacher want a child to think that people kissing are eating each other? (We will not even touch the sexual innuendo.) To make matters worse, the phrase is repeated a second time. Suffice it to say, the concept has no place in a picture book aimed at small children. Where on earth was the editor on this one?"
4,"Not Bad, But Not Their Best","Actually, I'd give this 3 1/2 stars. It has a strong Delta-blues influence with several laid-back acoustic & country-blues tracks. Lead singer Karen Lawrence is impressive as always, although she can't let loose here the way she does on the band's harder material. She's often compared to Janis Joplin, however I think she's much more similar to Dale Krantz from the Lynyrd Skynyrd spinoff, the Rossington-Collins Band. If Delta-blues is your style, you'll probably rate this album much higher. If you prefer a harder-rocking style of blues, you're better off looking for their LIVE AT THE LAKE double-CD. On the latter, Lawrence belts out the blues about as well as you'll ever hear it done."
5,Laura Love has done it again!,"Laura Love has done it again! With each album she gets better and better and this is no exception! This audio narrative allows listeners a clear picture of Laura's past challenges through songs such as the title track, You Ain't Got No Easter Clothes, Behind The Door and We Are Not. Songs such as Freak Flag and Ain't No Power demonstrate Laura's determination to find strength and hope, and Satisfied and Hard Times are rock the house declarations of hope and beauty.These songs are enjoyable not just lyrically, but because of the amazing instrumentation and variatons of style. No two songs sound exactly alike, with the last song being the stand alone melody wise, performed in the style and chorus of a spiritual."
2,A rehash of his other works,"If this is the first book you read by him you might find it beneficial. However, if you have read other books by him, you will find the contents to be a rehash of his other books, without the passion and imagination that is found in those books. For most of the chapters, he says what his theme for the chapter is going to be then footnotes another one of his books. This footnote shows that the ideas are found in another book by him.The one new element in this book is about sermon preparation. This gave a way for a minister to prepare a sermon."
5,Says it like it is,This documentary takes an interesting and comical look at how religion and our faith has been tailored to fit the needs of whomever is yelling the loudest at the time and has the best mass marketing approach. You would only take offense if you are those following the types of churches portrayed in the film. The ideal that controlling the minds of individuals through fear and the promise of salvation if you follow a specific path is not new to religion. I think the underlying theme to this film is to show how far we've reached from the initial intent of religion and God. It's not about doing one to others as you would want done to you or helping the sick and weak. It's about how much money you can collect to build a bigger church and buy more influence in those making decisions about our laws and economy. Unfortunately modern religion has become the furthest thing from what Jesus ever intended.
3,divorce,"Though I am sure this book has great advice in working through recovery. Most of the times these recovery books (for the most part) does not deal with the biblical issues of who should reconcile with their former spouse, or remain unmarried (1 Cor. 7:11a) or the like."
4,The big book's little brother,"I own this book and the large version. This one is a great quick reference guide. A perfect size to accompany you to a gun show or to your local gun shop. It obviously doesn't contain all of the in depth information that it's big brother does, but it thoroughly covers any questions you may have when evaluating a potential investment US 1911. There are plenty of detailed photos, drawings and descriptions that instruct you in identifying proper parts and accessories for each manufacturer and model. Good job Chuck!"
2,Monroe Matic Plus,"I ordered a set of Monroe Matic shocks and struts for my van, along with a set of bellows for the struts. When I received the parts I noticed that the boxes the struts and bellows came in were not printed with the Monroe logo on them like the shocks were. The struts were shipped from the manufacturer in a generic looking box. A labeled sticker was placed on the strut boxes that read Monroe made in the USA. The struts themselves have been stamped with made in Mexico. I called Monroe and they confirmed that the struts were sold under their name, but had no explanation on why the sticker label says made in the USA when the strut was stamped as made in Mexico. The shocks I received not only came in a printed box with a logo, but are stamped with made in the USA, which matches what is printed on the outside of their boxes. The paint on the shocks and struts are not an exact match. I now have concerns with the quality and consistency of Monroe, whereas before I did not."
3,Seachoice Trolling Motor Mount Kit,I ordered this mounting kit to mount my watersnake assault trolling motor to my 162 Scout Sport Fish. The mounting kit worked well but i ended up remounting without it because the four mounting screws just were not enough to hold my trolling motor as secure as i wanted it. I liked how it worked and if i had known that one kit would not do the job i would have ordered two. So end result... if your thinking of using this kit order two because one is not enough to properly secure the trolling motor to the boat (at least in my situation) otherwise it's a good product.
4,Get Fortified,"I keep re-reading parts of Dean's book. His easy conversational manner of conveying the material is quite ""digestible"". The basic premise he sets forth, to stick with how human bodies originally evolved as the key to what you put in them just makes so much sense. The concept of fortification of foods available in stores is something I myself have done for years without really realizing it. Because of the many recipes offered, we tend to keep it handy around my house for meal ideas. With summer upon us, I recommend checking out the salad section.S. LaceySmall Business Owner"
2,Did not get my utils,"This plane is not worth nearly $80, maybe $20. After many easters of styrofoam planes I don't know why I thought this one would be any different.My son got this as a Christmas present. It took about an hour to completely set up, and charge and deplete the battery 3 times as suggested. Anyway the plane took off and rose to about 10-12 feet and about 15 yards away then nose-dived out of control directly into the dirt. It was about 30 degrees. The wing broke in half and one of the horizontal stabilizers broke off. All of 5 seconds.The concept is great, but the styrofoam is very thin and crisp. Easily breaks. Do not recommend."
3,"Fun, but maybe not worth the money","I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend. A childhood throwback kind of thing. It was pretty fun when we finally figured out how to fly it, but it wasn't the most durable thing ever. We crashed it a few times before it finally broke. On the upside it was relatively easy to fix, but it affected the way the plane flew after the first time we repaired it. Overall it was a nice little throw back, but maybe not worth the money and definitely not recommended for children."
2,Not durable,"With much excitement my 9 year old daughter was eager to fly the plane. The first few runs were great; however, when we went to fly the plane later it would not fly correctly. We recharged the battery according to the directions and now we cannot get it to even start. Calling the manufacturer today and hoping for a receptive response. It is easy to operate but definitely not the most durable toy."
1,Junk,This airplane is a piece of junk. Worked for 40 seconds and failed.I still have not gotten my refund.It should be rated with - stars.Made in CHina?
3,Ok for the price.,"Worked fine until it melted the fuze and the relay stopped working properly. I am receiving a replacement, so my review may change after install. Thanks"
1,junk,lasted less than a week. first noticed the fan didnt come on. i raised the hood and bumped on the relay and the fan came on. the next day the fan didnt come on and nothing i could do would make it come on. took this system on and ran a toggle switch and now manually operate the fan. i cut it up and used the wire and fuse holder. waster of my $50.00
5,Works great as a compressor aftercooler!,"Though I can not say if this products works well as a transmission cooler, I can certainly vouch for its use as a compressor aftercooler. I have this unit installed on a Kobalt upright compressor from Lowes and it works great! To be specific, it is installed between the compressor and the tank, along with a moisture collector, to cool the compressed air and keep moisture out of the tank. This means no water in the tank (less problem with rust) and no water in the compressed air output (a good thing....!). The unit comes well packaged and includes the necessary connections and install parts. Seems well constructed too."
4,Hayden 516 Transmission cooler,"Easy enough to install, though I had to get another hose/screw connector to make it work with the Chevy 1500 (2006). The 2006 model has solid metal lines, and the adapters weren't in sufficient # (needed 3 only had 2). Auto parts store hooked me up though it could have been a real bear.It's OBVIOUS the transmission is running cooler, as you can touch the final tube on the stock trans oil cooler, and then touch the final tube on the Hayden. HUGE difference."
3,Where can I find errata.pdf file for 5th edition,Where can I find errata.pdf file for the 5th edition. Fig. 11-18 doesn't match with example 11-1. It should be corrected. The figure is from old editions. Any link? Today was my first experience with the 5th edition and first error.
3,Recommend,"I would recommend this face wash if you can wash your face with anything, I have sensitive skin and it still didn't work very well for my skin. Great for pregnant women"
4,Love it,"I loved using this product while pregnant because my skin was so out-of-wack and it seemed to calm it down. I loved the smell, I felt like I was giving myself a facial. It seems you can't use a lot of stuff when your pregnant on your face so this was the safest to use, but it is very expensive so I switched to my cheap stuff after my son was born."
5,Departure of a Giant,"As everybody knows by now, Salinger died yesterday at the age of 91, having last published in 1965 and interviewed in 1980.This is an insightful film that does a good job of exploring the most reclusive figure of modern literature. As Jay McInerney, interviewed by the film's protagonist, observes: Salinger summed up perfectly adolescent angst and the coming of age. He has no rivals in this area.In general, I like the French take on things American. They were on to Poe and Lovecraft long before anyone in this country. Writer Beigbeder's observations are cogent and original, his interviews and travels revealing. It's a very original exploration of a topic that is shrouded in mystery."
3,Simple animation with a decent story,"This was not made in the days of 3D animation and looks more like the Scooby-Doo style of it's time era. That said, the story is age old and a classic for children who probably won't notice the animation level anyway."
1,Why is this still being advertised?,I went to buy 6 of these and was informed the company was no longer selling this item. It took me a long time to find just the right item only to have the rug pulled out from under me. Pull this ad or honor my request.
3,Struck by lightning,"I ordered these for graduation gifts. Although the recipients were pleased, I thought they would be a little heavier."
2,More like butter rum...maybe?,"I purchased the cotton candy flavoring oil directly from the American Spice Company. We made a batch of ice cream with great expectations that were dashed when the final product was scooped into the bowls. My 3 1/2 year old said...""Mommy, this isn't cotton candy...I don't want it."" It tastes more like a version of butter rum but I can't quite put my finger on it...I would not buy again."
2,Movie is A MILLION TIMES better... that NEVER happens!,"I was really excited to buy this book because Ferngully was one of my favorite movies as I child. I couldn't wait to read the book (because they are always better!) but when I began, I was a little confused. The book is VERY poorly written. The dialogue is unrealistic and weak. The chain of events are unrealistic which is probably why they changed things around for the movie. I mean, I bought the book like...four months ago and I'm only halfway, forcing myself along. Maybe I'm a book snob but... I would say, without a doubt, don't read this book."
5,I love this book!,"This book is a great way for a French study to read a book that's all in French, but not feel over-whelmed. Hundreds of cognates are used so that you don't have to look up every single word in the back of the book. The author picked a very good story to re-tell as well. This book is based on ""Le Comte de Monte Cristo"" which is an awesome piece of fiction. That makes ""Histoire d'une Ravanche"" (Story of Revenge) an interesting read, which is crucial if you want the French students to actually READ the book. In other words, this is a great way to get French pupils reading French better, is much easier than ""Le Petit Prince"" of course, and has an entertaining plot. You should definately check it out!"
3,It's okay for a baby name book,"I wasn't too impressed with this baby name book for the fact that they had dumb names in here (i.e. Joe Bob), to the ones i completely hated and of course popular names like Jennifer and Michael. I just thought a lot of the names no one would even think about naming their child (at least i hope not). I was looking for some nice but not very popular names or names that are different than the usual. I did find some, but was hoping for more. I will be more choosy the next time i look at a baby name book."
4,Future Baby Fun,"We have 5 pregnant ladies in the factory and had a great time looking up potential names. Many of the ladies are hispanic and we had a fun time translating names into Latin/Spanish form, etc. It was great fun!"
5,Gaiamancy,This book was extremely helpful in creating balance in my home. I was overjoyed to learn that this book contained not only traditional Feng Shui BUT also Celtic and Medicine Wheel Overlays. I could pick and choose between the three wheels what aspects and solutions I wanted to bring into my home setting. My home is now a wonderful sanctuary of serenity!! I would highly recommend this multi-cultural Feng Shui book to others!!!
3,"Decent, but Different . . .","Overall, I enjoyed the book. Not a whole lot of depth, per say. And, I happen to take issue with the ""Tradition"" aspect.Why in God's name are people trying to keep Isshinryu traditional? It was not a traditional art to start with. And Shimabuku was always modifying the kata and his training. Why crystalize it now, after so much time has been put into the exploration of this amazing style?"
2,Poor Quality Control,"I head up a youth organization that is very active and competitive in air rifle marksmanship, and have consistently used the Crosman Premier Flat Match .177 pellets for years. I normally buy them OTC at a local sports retail store, but I was on vacation and needed pellets for a marksmanship safety camp that began on the Monday after I returned. Out of the first four tins that were opened, anywhere from 4 to 12% of the pellets were round head, not flat head. We can only use flat head in competition. A lot of time wasted having to sort out the round head pellets. I have NEVER had a contamination problem before. I hope this is not too small a problem for Pyramid to look into, but Crosman needs to do something about their quality control. If I get appropriate and responsive action from Pyramid, I may order from them again, but right now, will go back to the local retail store. I am giving a two star rating, because the shipping responsiveness was excellent."
5,accurate,Have used in several air guns and are very accurate in most of them. These are made better the crosman preimier ultra mag. Can not use in magnum springers.
2,Crosman clip 0401 itself is OK But...,"The clip appeared to be OK. It was stated that the clip fits a ""760 Pumpmaster"" It did not state that it would not fit older 760 pumpmasters of which I have."
1,2002 and newer only.,These only fit 2002 and newer Crosman Pumpmaster 760 rifles. The description fails to disclose this important fact. Apparently the rifles have been redesigned and therefore these do not work with pre 2002 models.
3,760 clips,WHOOOA!! These little guys are WAY TO MUCH MONEY. You can buy 4 of these direct from Crosman for less than $5.60 best you guys shop around a little. BTW these also fit in the new M417
3,Clips,The chips work fine. A little hard to line up and trying to figure out HOW to load them? At less I have extras!!
5,They were just what I ordered,"They work great just like the one that came with the my 760 pumpmaster, I don't know what else I can say"
3,Could be better...,"It is a good book in general, but i feel it assumes an intermediate to advanced level of knowledge of the subject.Quite often the explanations are not elaborate enough to understand the method discussed. A slightly more elaborate treatment would make this a first rate book."
4,Handy/Comfortable Pack,The Rick Steves Civita Daypack is comfortable and just the right size for day travel. The straps are cushioned to allow for easy carry of heavier items and the pack is roomy enough for a jacket and more. The only drawback is the that water bottle holders on the side are not solid enough to securely hold the bottles. Often when taking the pack on or off the water bottles would slip out despite the ability to tighten the netted 'pockets'. Few backpacks of this type had water bottle holders -- one of the attractive features. The color is great for both genders. My 9 year old son mainly used as it was smaller than most packs. We used for a week-long vacation in San Diego. We walked all day through the theme parks and parks.
5,A travel companion par-excellante,Used this backpack on a trip to Peru this winter... How wonderful A great day-pack with room for everything my husband and I needed for some expeditionary (albeit senior-level) travel.
5,"Soft,Light and convenient","My day pack arrived quickly and was great. I used it on my cruise to the Caribbean and walking around the daily cities. The different compartments were great, used one for my passport, the other for a camera and the other held a sweater. It was very soft and had straps to be used as a backpack. Great as an added ""personal bag"" carry on for the airline flight as well."
2,Dissapointment,"We bought this bag for a recent 2 week trip to Italy. Since I am a big Rick Steves fan, I thought the bag would be perfect. Turns out I was wrong. The material itself is fine, and the size is deceiving; it holds quite a bit. The problem we had was the zipper- by week 2 it was catching every time we zipped it up. At one point I actually thought it was going to rip the fabric it was so hard to separate the zipper from the fabric. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product."
2,Lightweight but difficult to use as a daypack,"For most men, this pack is difficult to carry as a backpack, since the straps are closely placed and it is a tight fit. It is light weight and packs easily, taking up little space, but uncomfortable to carry."
3,Well Researched but Poorly Constructed,"""Close To Shore"" is rich with historical background, and it is obvious throughout that the author has done his homework. This book truly captures the aura of its environment, and its attention to the details of American culture on the East Coast in 1916 nearly make it a worthwhile read sans man eating shark.However, I found the book went from good to mediocre as the ""plot"" progressed. The amount of detail and clever building of tension present in the first half of the book simply exhausted themselves and were nowhere to be seen in the book's concluding chapters. The most extraordinary, gruesome moments of this real-life event were rushed through, and the grand finale literally left me expecting a final plot twist which would reveal the ""real"" ending.In all, not a bad book, but there have been better works about sharks. Not for the action-seeking or the gore-loving."
4,This booked got me reinterested in history,"Close to Shore was the first book of my post-academic adult life to make me interested in history. Capuzzo does a wonderful job of describing America at the start of the 20th century. The political, social, and economic changes that would shape the world I grew up in are revealed. I gained new insight. Oh, and by the way, a shark attacked some people. As you can see from my perspective, the significant part of the book is not the shark. The shark provides a fantastic backdrop to display an era. Read this book because you are more interested in the era than in sharks."
5,INTENSE,CAPUZZO'S DEPICTION OF THE 1916 NEW JERSEY SHARK ATTACKS ARE BREATHTAKING. THIS BOOK OFFERS NOT ONLY DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF THE NUMEROUS SHARK ATTACKS OF THAT PERIOD BUT ALSO PAINTS THE ATMOPHERE OF A VERY SKEPTICAL EARLY 1900S. WHEN SHARKS WERE THOUGHT TO BE HARMLESS AND SEA MONSTERS WERE THE ONLY AQUATIC PREDATORS. IT WAS A TIME WHEN OCEAN SWIMMING WAS COMING TO LIFE AND WAS FAST BECOMING A NORM BUT LIKE WITH ANYTHING THAT IS GOOD THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING BAD. CAPUZZO'S KNOWLEGDE OF SHARKS AND OF THAT TIME PERIOD ARE OUTSTANDING. HIS DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF THE SHARK'S MANY ATTACKS ARE BETTER THAN ANY MOVIE.
2,Careless Writing and Editing Detract From This Book,"This book was recommended by a friend of mine and I'd spent my high school years in New Jersey not far from the shore. I expected to enjoy the Close to Shore. However, there were many inaccuracies and misstatements in it. These detracted very significantly from my enjoyment of the book. The author and editor both appear to have rushed the book to print with little time spent reviewing what had been written."
2,great writing/poor accuracy,"Michael Capuzzo is an excellent writer and I wasn't certain why the book had to be semifictionalized. For example, why was the summer Whitehouse transplanted(artificially) from Asbury Park to Spring Lake ? Was it to make the second attack closer to the Woodrow Wilson summer offices ? It's just that the true story is so fantastic on its own without the need for embellishment."
4,An Easy Read...,"Capuzzo's Close to Shore is a quick read for anyone who wants to get acquainted with the famous 1916 New Jersey shark attacks, which resulted in 4 deaths and mass panic along coastal New Jersey and the New York City metropolitan area. Capuzzo's book reads somewhat like a novel, and can be read in conjunction with Richard Fernicola's Twelve Days of Terror, also an outstanding book on this topic (but with greater technical detail).Capuzzo's strength is his research into the cultural background of the eastern U. S. seaboard during this time period. One feels immersed in the history of the time period, which helps us to understand the panic that occurred when the coastal bathing areas suddenly became places of fear rather than relaxation.This item is a good summer read."
3,Good read,Close to Shore is a highly detailed account of the shark attacks on the New Jersey shore in 1916. The author does a great job of describing the shark attacks from the shark's point of view. His details of the time period the people and places in that period are impecable. The only complaint I have of his book is that it took way too long to get to the meat of the story (the shark attacks). With a little editiong this would have been a great read.
4,"A true story that is close to the edge, the REAL JAWS","CLOSE TO THE EDGE is well written and a real page turner. I hated to see it end. The true story of what seems to be an unbelievable chain of events. The ignorance of the science community is mind boggling. The science community and the public learn of the first shark attacks on an United States shores together. This book has everything, great story, prominate figures our President was even in the area. An area that had no idea what to expect. If you liked JAWS you will love this."
2,Bloated,Not a bad writer. However there's not enough material in this story that warrants a full length book. The shark stuff is engrossing and he does a good job of covering that aspect. The personal stories are just too lightweight. Not interesting.This should have been a magazine article and not a book.
4,Close to Shore: A True Story of Terror in an Age of Innocence,"This was a well written story of the ""Jaws"" type but in this case based on true facts of a shark that becamse a ""man"" eater. Gruesome and savage in some places, soft and comforting in others. Worth a read!"
4,Shark Attack,"This is definitely not the book you want to take with you to read on the beach this summer. Wisely, I put off reading it until I returned from my week at the Jersey shore, the site of the shark attacks outlined inside. Many of these places are familiar to me, and it gave me goose bumps to read about how frequently sharks come close to bathers along our coasts. I don't remember seeing a shark in Jersey for the past 15 years or so, and that one was rather distant from shore, but the terror still remains, since I was in the water at the time, and hustled back to shore at the call of the lifeguard. The author does a very credible job at evoking a vanished time and place in our history, and I salute him for that. There is a bit of overwriting in this work, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it's a very good book, in my opinion, and it told me something about our history that I hadn't known. For that alone I wish to commend the author."
3,Death by Adjective Attack,"This book is perhaps the most over-written book in recent memory. Capuzzo mars a story that is compelling on its own by reaching way too far - padding the tale with extraneous, awkward, inappropriate social history and detail that contributes little to the inherent drama. And sentence after sentence after sentence after sentence goes on and on and on and on as if he were being paid by the word and evey noun deserved not one, but two or three adjectives - his thesaurus function must be worn out on his laptop. I was really looking forward to this book and enjoyed it after the first 100 pages, when the writer finally got out of the way and let the facts of the story tell itself. But the first hundred pages were absolutely excruciating. Great writing is transparent; there is far too much murk in this book."
2,"Not as good as ""Twelve Days of Terror""","""Close to Shore"" was disappointing to me. The author seemed to have only 1/3 the material needed to fill a book of that length. The first 80 or so pages go by with no shark encounters, and long digressions into local family history. While entertaining at times, the story was very rambling with frequent side tracks. ""Twelve Days of Terror"" was much more to the point and informative."
2,Jaws Re-write,"I am in love with the story of the 1916 shark attack enigma and Close To Shore does add a bit to my Library on the subject, at least as a novelty. The book was essentially a re-write of Jaws with a Ragtime flavor. Jaws was great, but I think the 85 year-old story is powerful enough on it own to take the gruesome thrill of shark attack to a new level. This telling was just too scented with fiction to keep my interest."
1,Dime a Dozen,After kicking and screaming through Close to Shore I decided to think more openly about the fact I waited to get two thirds through a shark book before hearing about a shark attack. The real problem here is that I read Twelve Days of Real Terror before Cappuzzo's embellished version. The guts of this commentary is that anyone could and will do what Cappuzo did. His writing is fine and it is also fine to re-write a historic event. I just saw something so unique and unmatchable in the other book by Dr. Fernicola. Is it any wonder that Twelve Days of Terror has beat out Close to Shore in NJ the entire summer--and that's despite a multimillion dollar ad campaign by Broadway.....
4,Review of Audiocassette,"The audiocassette version of Close to Shore is a moody diversion that build in intensity. The shark attacks of 1916 could be descirbied as an anomaly, but they terrified the entire East Coast. Capuzzo was able to capture that fear by providing an excellent glimpse into life in America before its involvement in World War I. The audiocassette conveys the turmoil of how people's perceptions of safety and dominance were shattered by a rogue shark. Why the shark did what it did is still a mystery, but Capuzzo does provide some excellent background on marine life to put the shark in its proper context."
3,Good for the hip hop coffee table,"Dropping Science is a pithy collection of quotes from a wide variety of hip hop figures, past and present. It's a great book for flipping through, so get it if you are looking to add some flavor to your coffeetable. It won't get much use on your bookshelf."
3,FUN BUT FLIMSY!,"This microphone does have good sound but is quite flimsy. I would not suggest moving it around again and again (which is exactly what my 7 year old wants to do). She loves it, but it is not as tough as I would have liked."
4,"Getting back at big-business, fat-cats and politicians.","If you should ever find this book at a local bookstore, make sure to snatch it up. Mr. West's ideas on humor go straight through the brains of those he is writing to. Why would a helicopter manufacturer respond to his letter requesting a small gunship helicopter to be used to ferry important people from small South American countries while carrying ""about 1,000 pounds of an agricultural substance""? Because the people he is writing to don't understand the meaning of the word ""person"". To them, we are all just numbers, and we get the same pat answers to all of our questions. The joke, however, is on us for ridiculing these people while at the same time buying their products, giving them votes and paying their bills!"
5,Everything I hoped for!!,I'm a Fashion student grad and absolutely love this machine! I've always worked with industrial ones so I always thought domestic machines weren't as good. Was I wrong! This little 2-in 1 serger and coverstitch is amazing. I definitely recommend this to every sewer! Spend a little more to get the coverstitch because they are $1500+ easy.
3,Nice Telephoto,"It's a good option if you are looking to get closer in your photos, which is good because you get more natural expresions from the people you photograph. The downside is that some of the functions of the camera doesn't work as usual."
1,Junk,If you enjoy vignetting and blurry images then this is the product for you. Very disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Klutz allows anyone to build a strong foundation in the art,"This book is a wonderful starting point for entering the world of juggling. It removes the apprehension and proves to anyone that, indeed, they can juggle. Once one has gone through the book, cover to cover, they have a strong foundation on which to grow. The art of juggling is limitless, and Cassidy just barely scratches the surface. His book is definitely the place to start."
5,You can juggle...,"This book is the best way to learn how to juggle. I've looked at other book's sections on learning the basics, but they don't compare to this book. After a very detailed section on learning the basics on how to juggle (with will take from hours to days to actually do), the book tells you how to do a few tricks, as well as juggling 4 balls, 5 balls, and clubs. And best of all, it comes with free juggling bean bags that are really well made (I still have mine 10 years later).The only problem with the book is that once you learn everything in the book, there isn't any tips after that besides from telling you that anything works and be creative. I did learn how to do everything described in the book (besides from juggling 5 balls), and I found that once you learn everything in it, the Complete Juggler by Dave Finnigan is a nice book to teach you more stuff once you learn the basics from this book."
5,A worthy gift,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, who learned the art juggling late in her life. She got really good at it practicing with this product.She brings these nice 'square balls' out when we have kids visiting, and you must see the wonder in their eyes when they see her juggling!Anyone who wants to learn the art of juggling, this is what you want.Inexpensive and a lot of fun."
3,Juggling,"The book was good, but the picture of it showed three juggling 'balls' as well and I did not receive them. Should I have?"
4,"This is a good book if you want ""Learn"" to Juggle","I basicly taught myself how to juggle, and it would have been much eisier to learn if I had this book. but the book also lacks any more advanced tricks. I also didn't like the way they made juggling 5 balls sound Imposible, It isn't that hard it just takes pretty long time. If you just want to learn how to juggle than this is a great book, but if you already can I'd recomend ""Beyond the Cascade"" by Georg Gillson, it has step by step instructions to 88 3 ball tricks."
2,Beginner's Only!!!,"I personally think this book gets more publicity then it deserves. It's good for a beginner only. A real, true juggling beginner. Because it doesn't go into the depths and advances juggling can go into. Not even close!!! But, if you don't know how to juggle and want to know how. Get this book, then go to The Complete Juggler then start doing the real stuff!!! Go to the JIS to find out more info about juggling."
5,Clifton Webb is Mr.Belvedere :) :) :),"This title is to be released on July 3rd 2012 as part of the initial release of titles (35 titles altogether) under the ""20th Century-Fox Cinema Archives"", their version of ""MOD"" releases, and has an SRP of $26.99...there are already two e-tailers with pre-orders available. When will Amazon have these three titles available for pre-ordering (???):1. Hudson's Bay2. Mr.Scoutmaster &3. Mr.Belvedere Rings The BellI've waited a long time for ""FOX"" to open it's vault and start issuing ""MOD"" editions. I can't wait for Amazon to follow suit and allow pre-orders as these titles become available...so I can spend $$$...OOHHH MIII...THANK YOU !!!Have fun :)"
4,Love Clifton Webb,"Hope to find some of the other old Mr. Belvedere movies. Really enjoyed watching this with the family, Told several friends about finding this and some of the other old movies we got at Christmas."
3,Carelessly written book - helps in learning SQL with ample frustration,"I wish the authors had taken care to write the book.Many of the features shown in the book do not work as stated. For example, use of || to concatenation do not work with the samples; you have to use a + sign instead. I found that out by looking at the MS Access piece provided in the CD that comes along with the book (thanks for this, or I would have given up learning SQL).Secondly, the CAST function does not work with the SQL trial CD either. So, one has to work hard in understanding whether the errors one gets are a result of their own mistakes or due to authors carelessness in writing the book.Not all is in vain! There is a silverlining to the authors' carelessness - one ends up learning SQL well while getting frustrated :)"
3,Just for Beginners,"After reading a few pages of the book, I was really disappointed. This book is too easy. If you have ever written any sql statement, you probably need not this book.But if you don't know anything about sql, it explains sql very easy way with many similar examples. :-)"
5,If you want to learn SQL--buy this book!,"Unquestionably one of my best purchases. This book is terrific! If you're learning SQL for the first time or want to know more than ""SELECT. . .FROM. . .WHERE"" then buy this book! It allows you to really understand how to create all kinds of queries, rather than just being able to write command strings. The authors break complex concepts down into easy to understand lessons. The content is comprehensive and sophisticated but presented in a very intuitive way. Learning SQL has never been easier. The only drawback--and it's not the authors' fault--since, unfortunately, different database programs use different SQL syntax, you will have to refer to the manual for your specific program for some command strings. But you will learn so much from this book that your manual will actually make sense. This book is a must-have!"
4,"Not perfect, but I learned a lot","I'm new to SQL and don't have any other SQL books, but I found this book to be pretty helpful. The authors style is easy to read for the most part, but at times he gets a little long winded and kind of glosses over important technical points in an attempt to give you the broad picture. Nevertheless, it remains pretty readable overall. Personally, I found there to be a steep difference in the learning curve between the first and second halves of the book. The first 7 chapters are basically skimable material and I think the book would benefit from dedicating more pages to chapters 8 through 14 where most of the real meat is (joins, subqueries, grouping, etc.). Between the sample statements and the problems in the back of the book, there are lots of good examples, and I do feel like a learned a lot of SQL."
2,"Good book, but outdated","This book is well written, however, it is out of date. We have had SQL 2000 installed for a couple of years now, and I was hoping to use this book to help me along. While it is good at communicating ideas, it falls down on syntax since it's out of date."
3,Not for Insertion,"While this text may be fine for writing queries for the retrieval of data, it was useless for my task of populating an empty database from a variety of flat files."
4,Good but...,"Good book but should point out the differences with Access, SQL Server, Oracle, DB2 and other database servers. This book is about the SQL standard, which is good, but a lot of things can't be used in real life. Overall, a very good book though!"
3,So so,"This book did not have enough specific examples. Someone could describe a platypus to you(if you've never seen one), or they could show you a picture. Good examples are like pictures, they give a rapid insight into the material. ..."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was excited to get this book until going through 450+ pages, I realized it was more of a beginners book than serious data manipulation."
4,Great Book,"If starting out or know the basics of Select whatever from table, this book is for you. It explains SQL in a way you can understand, using real databases you would use.I did learn the hard way from a MS-SQL 7 book with queries, and the information in here seems redundant to what I already know through about 1 year of SQL queries through ASP.I would like to see a book that had more advanced problems other than 150 pages of explaining JOIN statements, while providing examples someone might use on a daily basis. ..."
5,An outstanding introductory book on SQL,"The book is very easy to read. It comes with a CD containing five great databases with examples to work. Solutions are supplied in the database, too. This is a great feature for checking if one's answers are correct or helping out on more difficult problems one may not be able to readily solve."
3,Thanks,"The product was delivered in exceptional condition and in great time. I must have misread the details, though, because I was looking for the ENTIRE Bible on CD."
5,Bible on CD,Awesome Drama...You feel like you are right there with them.Easy to hear and understand.
1,bad search on Amazon,"i searched for ""old Testament"" then the New Testament came up. I already had the new testament, but it was one of the first to show in the search, so I got it by mistake - no returns, go figure. Anyone want it?"
4,Loved it!!,My daughter bought these for her Dad's Christmas present. He listens to them while on the treadmill. Great for anyone that doesn't have the time to sit down and read.
1,Disturbing,"It is frightening to read this book and realize just how much hate can be directed at one group of people. Sprigg foams at the mouth then tries to catch himself and support what he's saying with ""science."" It's not science, it's garbage. How in the world does something like this get published in the first place?The pathetically homophobic Peter Sprigg needs a hug - preferably from a hot, sexy man."
1,Straight Married Christian Lady Has A Comment,"I am a heterosexual woman married to a white heterosexual man. I am the epitomy of everything ""decent"" the right wing holds dear. The only man I have ever slept with is my husband. I was married loooong before our son was born. I live in the South, I am a Catholic, and my parents have been married almost fifty years. I am the woman married to the man this author and all the Christian right want to protect and I am asking you to please knock it off already! I don't care if two men or two women want to be married. I don't give a damn. My life and my marriage are NOT in dire peril because of this. Good Lord, get a friggin' life and knock off the crap already. Anybody who wants to buy this book, listen up: If you want to be a real Christian, donate that money to a hospice instead. Idiots."
1,Pure Ignorance,"I am a happily married father of two. Despite Sprigg's hateful diatribe, I do not understand how gay people getting married is supposed to affect my union one way or another. Will I suddenly stop loving my wife? Will my commitment to her suddenly vanish? No. This book just tries to scare people into fearing gay marriage by predicting all these horrible outcomes that are pretty far fetched.I hope my kids create a better world where bigots like this are laughed at and ignored. That's why I send them to good schools."
5,Great DVD,"I've been a fan of Take That since the early days. This is a great dvd because it gives you a look inside what was going on with all of them during that time, and after the breakup. So for any fan out there thinking of buying this I think you will really enjoy it a lot."
2,Painful,I couldn't finish the movie. I turned if off about half way through. Nia Vardalos was painful to watch. Her character had such quirky mannerisms and expressions that it was cartoonish. She also looked cross eyed. She was awful. The story line was boring and even John Corbett's good looks couldn't save the movie.This one is a stinker that is not worth watching much less purchasing.
1,Poor Quality,"This Item is Wide screen only, not what I wannted, I wanted regular or standard screen, Story or Movie is still well done. I don't enjoy watching because of the wide screen issue."
2,Entirely disappointing,"I wanted to like this film: I like both Nia Vardalos and John Corbett, and I thought they had terrific chemistry in Greek Wedding. But in this movie, Vardalos in particular seems to have turned into some kind of a caricature of the cheerful, single florist. She's so completely wooden and the dialog so stilted that there's no chance for the possibility of chemistry to develop between the key characters. And there are huge gaps between each actor's lines: it felt like they were reading teleprompters off set or something. I also found the passing of time in the film to be unrealistic to the point that I felt a little whiplash when we ended up a year later from the time the movie started, with very little character development being the result. I'm disappointed: I was hoping for more - just a good little romantic flick to pass a cold and wet afternoon. Sadly, I had to turn it off before it was over; it was that bad."
3,love to hate...,"simple plot, mindless viewing, but cute and endearing. predictable, yet sweet. good for prime members, wouldn't pay to see, though."
2,Disappointing,"It's odd and puzzling that the same crew that gave usMy Big Fat Greek Weddingnow bring usI Hate Valentine's Day. The couple fromMy Big Fat Greek Wedding, Nia Vardalos and John Corbett, again become lovers, but in a totally different context. However, the former film was brimming with energy; this film seems a bit slow and scripted. The characters seem almost robotic, stating lines that seem almost as awkward to say as they are to listen to. I think it comes down to the script, which lacks spontaneity and subtlety. I didn't laugh once duringI Hate Valentine's Day. Too bad - it would have been nice to recapture the magic ofMy Big Fat Greek Wedding."
3,Predictably Cute,"I enjoyed this movie! It was predictable and a bit drawn out, but very likable. This movie would be perfect for viewing on a lazy, rainy day."
1,I Hate This Movie,"This movie is all kinds of awful. My wife rented this and as a result I ended up seeing it. The plot is ridiculous, contrived and makes no sense. The actress Nia may have been good in Greek Wedding but shes used up her goodwill. Basically she has this rule in the movie that she will only go out with a guy 5 times because she does not want to commit. Of course any movie that makes it seem like Nia is the hot one who every guy wants is all ready beyond belief. Basically Nia made this movie to make herself look good. If I can save one person from watching this movie I will have done my job. So to summarize this movie is awful and unenjoyable. plot is stupid characters are stupid everything is stupid."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This movie is SSSSLLLOOOOWWWW... and tedious! The main girl-character is weird. She always has a ""painted on"" smile on her face and the guy seems like a fish out of water, neither one knows what's up from down! I wish I could get my money back for this crappy flick! =("
3,Has Charming Moments But It Is Not Greek Wedding,"Some moments of this film are truly charming and clever. Though a few characters are stereotypes, (example the clingy friend who scares men away and the dirty-minded, annoying best friend) Vardalos plays a woman with a whole different love and life philosophy than your average heroine. She's not looking for love at all. As a matter of fact she's so anti-commitment she won't take a date beyond the 5th.Of course, it wouldn't be a chick-flick if that worked for her.I just recently viewed Nia Vardalos ""My Life in Ruins"" too. I Hate Valentine's Day is closer to Big Fat Greek Wedding in the writing and character interactions, but it's still not there."
1,So Boring I Decided to Read Instead,"This movie was so awful that after my fiancee and I watched it for 5 minutes I decided to read instead. A few minutes later she turned it off. The jokes were not funny. It was way slow, and the chemistry that was there in big fat greek wedding was not on the screen.Stay far away!"
3,Pretty F**kin' good but could of been better.,It is a preety decent live show but it does not macth up to Vulgar or Watch It Go One Bit. Phillip is trying to give speach's give me a break but other than that it is a good video!
4,Comfortable shoes,"I purchased these shoes for walking around the neighborhood. While they are very comfortable - they are not very fashionable. Sometimes, you have to forgo style for comfort."
5,Propet flex walker,"These shoes are made to be comfortable right out of the box. It's probably because I got an extra wide width - the size 10 I normally wear is just a bit too big, so my next pair will be a half-size smaller. But finally there's plenty of room for my toes. I have arthritis in my knees and a ""pump bump"" on my heel - these shoes give great support and allow me to walk longer and farther without pain."
5,FMA Rocks,My all time favourite. I watched the original series and now im going to watch the newer version of FMA :)
5,<3 this series,"I <3 fullmetal alchemist!Somewhat different yet the same as FMA, just different endings. Would recommend people watching it! Arrived on time yay for prime! Boo to California taxes now >:("
4,price?,i bought the first part of the collection and anxiously waiting for the second part. but i really do not understand why part 2 is much expensive the first one. (same amount of blu rays and part 1 has more run time) i hope they'll reduce the price and we'll complete the fma: brotherhood collection.
3,Great for Groomers- not much more!,"I bought this book hoping for more information on pet sitting. I should have been warned by the fact that the author is a groomer - a good 70% of the content is geared toward starting your own grooming shop. The information appears to be thorough and well written as regards grooming and the grooming business.If you are looking for a book with information on becoming a pet sitter, though, this book contains only general information, much of which can be had online by joining mailing lists or bulletin boards."
5,How to Start a Home Based Pet Care Business,This book has been very helpful. With step by step ways to get started on your way with your new business. I am taking grooming classes and want to start my own grooming shop in about a year and this book tells you how to get started.
2,How to start a small business - too basic,"Uneven coverage of different kinds of businesses. I was looking for something on Pet Sitting, and the book has very limited chapter on this subject. Other types of businesses have much more extensive coverage. Some extrapolates from one small business to another, but lots doesn't. Not very useful as a pet sitting how-to manual."
2,A Travesty Against All Higher Sensibility,"This book is a rarity - for despite that I found it ridiculous, I actually read through it! (I was in one of my more curious moods, and had made the decision to humour myself.) Quite over-rated, this. Tess was unfortunately a victim of Thomas Hardy's adoration. Upon her pedestal she perpetuated her irksome fate most unrealistically. She and the two men entangled in her folly float on some nonsensical cloud of bliss. They never touch the earth. All through the course of this story, Tess is a leaf floating along on a windy cloud. It is not until the end that she takes a ludicrously uncharacteristic stand against her fate. Infuriating, that. One may only conclude that she has no soul. She is but the spiritless embodiment of Hardy's ultimate tragic heroine."
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this CD to add to my collection of music for therapeutic massage. I should have listened to all of the tracks first. I took this to our massage school clinic and played it while 7 people were receiving a massage from the students. Almost all of the clients started complaining about the music half way through the massage. When I abruptly changed the CD, I heard muffled sounds of relief. What more can I say?"
1,Not a good buy!,"My In-Law's bought this toy for our son. We wanted a kick start kind of toy for him so we were excited about this one and the price. After putting it together we couldn't get the kick part working. We had to hit it hard with our fist to get it going. It would not be good for my boy, he kicks hard but I don't want him hurting himself. We took it apart and went to get our money back. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,I took this toy back!!!,"I took this toy back!!! I bought it for my son when he was 3 months old because he loved to kick. This toy was hard for him to kick and when he did kick it and got the music going it scared the daylights out of him. The toys where so high up he couldn't hit them. Don't waste the money, but if you do try it keep the box so you can return it."
3,Carnival Review,"I got this as a baby shower gift, and it is okay. The music played for WAY too long on the first setting, and both me and my husband got tired of hearing it, and I think even my daughter started trying to tune it out. I switched it to the second one, and now when she kicks it (or bats at the toys if I put her in the opposite way), it plays briefly and she knows it was her action that makes the music. This toy was a royal pain to set up, I got it mostly done and my husband had to finish because I apparently didn't have the physical strength to get the screws in all the way. (I was 8.5 months pregnant at the time.) I like the fact she will be able to use it for a long time, but I think I would have been happier with something else."
3,loved it at first,"My son, now 10 months old doesn't enjoy this toy anymore. It was purchased for him for Christmas when he was an infant. He would lay on the floor and play with the hanging toys for awhile, then give up in boredom. The kicking supposedly was to start the music, no such luck. When he was able to sit and reach the spinning thing at the top, he would put his hand on it to stop it from spinning, and a very loud noise came from it. It frightened him. Plus, when he layed on the floor, he would kick it up in the air and somehow would move it over his head and down it came right on top of his face. So.... we now have it down in my older son's playroom."
2,danger!!!!!!!,My son almost broke his ankle becuase he got it stuck in the ball hole. He wasn't able to walk yet and there is no restriction on age!!!! BE CAREFUL!!! This happened after we converted it into a sit and play toy. BEWARE!!!! He did this a few times!!!
2,No Carnival For Me,"The music is way too loud even on the lowest setting. The music is horrible and very annoying. The only thing that is good about it is the lights. If you're going to get a product like this, I would reccomend the Leap Frog learning gym. It has a large selection of songs from around the world, and the lights and mobile catch and hold my baby's attention for quite a while. Don't waste your money on the Kick and Whirl!"
1,I hate this toy and so does my daughter!!,"We bought this for my daughter a month ago because she fit into the age recommendation. This toy was basically a HUGE waste of money. I'm very disapointed in Fisher Price for making such a boring toy. The balls are hard for me to pull off of the wheel so you can imagine how it must be for my daughter. The music is very annoying and one of the attachments already broke. I can't believe this thing cost $35.00. I'm very disapointed and I wish I could return it, but I threw out the box before I gave my daughter a chance to play with it."
2,Not a carnival at all,"This is not the joyous carnival the advertisement showed it to be. The smaller toys are held on by little pegs, and when they come off the baby can hurt herself by rolling face down onto them. The ""whirling"" balls are too small, and were a choking hazard for my dog. Plus the thing is loud! Since it responds to vibrations, no one can walk around anywhere in the house without setting it off.Please don't buy this toy! Although it looked fun, it was a huge waste (...)"
1,NOT SAFE AT ALL!!!,I wish I would have read this recent review. My son was crawling backwards toward the toy and his foot got stuck in the small hole for the balls. When I went to pick him up he started screaming because his foot was stuck. I thought I was going to have to call 911 because I could not get his foot out!!! It took forever to get his foot in the right position to get it out without really hurting him. His foot is all swollen and red. NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS TOY AT ALL AND WILL BE THROWING IT OUT!!!
3,Poor marketing and not really fun,"My daughter had a Kick and Play Bouncer and really loved it. Naturally, my husband and I were looking for something a little different that still rewarded what our 2 month old did best, kicking. I picked this up thinking that she would love it. Instead, it just seemed to frustrate her. After one kick, the music would play for five minutes. No matter what you do, it always starts off with that circus favorite ""Enter the Gladiators"" which only seemed to make her cry. The toys that she could bat at are too high up for a three month old to reach. Now that she is older and can sit up, she is still very unimpressed by the whole device. And like other parents, I'm not sure that I want her staring at those spinning, spiral balls for more than ten minutes. My advice is to just get a bouncer and give your child fun, educational toys to play with while he/she sits. I'm certain that will be more enjoyable."
2,Poopy Whirl,"My mother-in-law bought this gift for our 8 month old daughter because she loves to kick and enjoys music. After 30 minutes of assemblying the toy, we were disappointed that it doesn't really matter where she kicks, just moving the frame makes it go. She wasn't very interested in kicking it, so we put it in the sit up position - you practically need two people to switch positions. We placed the twirling toys in the base sections so she could play with them and as soon as she grabbed them they always fell off. The balls are too tight for a baby to pull them out of the ferris wheel, so we had to pull them out for her and then they would get stuck in the base of the ramp where she couldn't see them. We're very disappointed and plan to return it for something more entertaining and child-friendly."
4,My daughter LOVES this!!,"Don't let these other reviews fool you - This toy is very sturdy, the music stays on fo quite a while and it keeps my 3 month old entertained for a good half hour at times. She can kick the hanging toys and start the music without a lot of effort. The bright colors and smiley faces keep her focus. I like that she can use it in a different way as she gets older - she won't get bored. She loves this toy. I would suggest this toy for any baby."
1,TAKE IT BACK!!,"This is useless. My son is now 13 months and STILL does not play with it. We keep it in hopes that he would like it when he got older. He did not enjoy it as an infant. It was hard to kick. Now he is too busy and is into more active toys (leap frog's learning table, blocks, push toys, etc)GET the playskool kick gym. We did!!!! Our son loved itOther toys that we like- Jumperoo, the laugh and learn house, leap frog car, and table"
1,Not really rewarding,"this toy is barely kick-activated. There is only one of the toys that activates the music/entertainment. When it is activated, it runs for 5 minutes which is far too long in my opinion. The ""kick-Pad"" is not a kick-pad at all. If you are looking for that, I would highly recommend the Kick and Play bouncer from Fisher Price."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,Not worth the money!!!! Piece of junk! It is not kick activated as stated in the advertisements. I actually called the company and am receiving a credit because I had thrown out the packaging.
