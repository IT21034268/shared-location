3,waterford wine glasses,They were pretty and I ordered them to add to my set of lismore wine glasses but there a little bit shorter than my origenal ones.
3,"Two two-ounce glasses, not four-ounce, is what we got.","The price, packing and delivery were all good. However, we ordered what was clearly labeled as FOUR-OUNCE and instead received two TWO-OUNCE glasses, quite tiny. We didn't have the strength to repack them and send them back. I guess they're nice if you happen to be tiny as well.On the plus side, they ARE Irish crystal, which some buyers had said they aren't."
3,"Not-so-happy Halloween, Spidey!","This video is very special to me because it's the first one I ever bought. It featured Spider-Man and his archenemy the Green Goblin. I saw elements of this episode on the Spider-Friends' ""Triumph Of The Green Goblin"", but it's way cooler when he's solo. The Goblin is one of my favorite Spider-Foes and his confrontations with Spidey are always a treat to watch. With his knowledge of Spidey's true identity as one of his weapons, that makes Goblin more dangerous. However, Spidey managed to put a stop to his vengeful plans against him and J. Jonah Jameson --- the other pain-in-the-butt. Peter's relationship with Betty Brant provided a sweet touch, but I wish I knew who was the lady who kissed him at the party, too. Hey, he can't be unsuccessful with women forever, can he? It seems to me that this Spidey series doesn't get much props like the others, but I really think it should. Therefore, for the true Spider-Fans, spin a web-line and catch this video."
1,Very bad video transfer.,"I got my copy awhile ago because I enjoy movie after I watched online since video was nice and clear. After couple months, I decided to watch movie again the once I bough from Amazon. I got a great surprise on video which was grained and snow pop which was worst than VHS tape. I've learned my lesson and wish my $$ back."
3,Shame it was Heavily Edited,"Very good production values and great acting. I would easily give this movie four stars if it hadn't been edited into a confusing collection of semi-related scenes. As others have pointed out, this movie is very very confusing due to the heavy editing and multiple jump cuts. This version shouldn't even be offered for sale, it is so poor. Again, good movie, terribly mutilated, by over zealous editing, movie.Amazon, please withdraw this version; all it really does is give the viewer an extremely long trailer for what seems to be an excellent movie. Please release the _uncut_ version."
3,Battle of Neretva,"Battle scenes can be epic and lots of extras. The producers do their best to create accurate weapons/tanks/guns and uniforms. Believable for the most part. Of course, the heroic partisans outsmart the Germans too much - for my tastes. A long movie and could have been better with more action scenes in it for being so long to watch."
2,Battle of Neretva DVD,Great story but film was not all that. The film was dark in some scenes and the sound was bad. I think when they converted it to DVD they lost some of original color and sound. Yal was great
1,the battle of neretva,"When I received the movie on DVD I was very happy because I can replace my vhs tape,except when I made three atempts to play the movie I got (can not play due to limitations).TO me the movie was not advertised right I believe amazon should look into see if this is A region 2 and not A standard."
2,disappointed!,"I had been aware of this movie for quite awhile and was happy to finally get a copy on DVD. Perhaps because of the poor dubbing, this was little better than the many ""spaghetti"" war films I have in my collection. While there appears to be a great effort on the producers' part to craft an epic war movie, there is an abysmal lack of contiuity and context. The technical aspects are pretty well executed, with proper uniforms and weapons. Also there are ""Tiger"" tank mock-ups based on T-34 chassis as seen in Kelly's Heroes. And those attacking planes(Sokos maybe?) do resemble FW 190s at first glance, all of which make this film all the more disappointing. Some great actors seem wasted, and even the legendary Bernard Herman was off his game with his uncharacteristically bland musical score. I'd like to see it remastered, and with proper subtitles so that the dialogue would be in the respective languages. Perhaps then this film will earn the ""epic"" description some have chosen to apply to it."
2,The Battle of Neretva,The movie itself was poor in sound and filming. There were lots of good action.Over all the movie was OK.The Battle of Neretva
1,Magnificent score - terrible movie,"Not to step on toes, but I can't believe that this stinker has gotten 4 star reviews from as many reviewers. The only reason to endure this mess is Bernard Herrmanns' gigantic score. Sadly, not even he could breath life into this snoozefest."
4,Great forgotten Disney with Rex Allen,"This movie was one I had never seen but rented on just it being a Rex Allen narrated Disney film. My family and I recently watched Charlie the Lonesome Cougar and it put me in a nostalgic mood for the Disney of my early youth. Although The Legend of Lobo was made in the early 60's, these films were all shown on the Wonderful World of Disney through the 70's.The Legend of Lobo didn't disappoint in the humorous tone of voice that marked Rex Allen's best narrations. The wildlife photography was amazing and just as fresh today as it was nearly 5 decades ago. I think the only caution I would make to a family setting down to watch this is that there is animal cruelty in the form of spring loaded traps used to catch the father of Lobo. This caused my wife to leave the family room. The violence is not particularly graphic but it is suggested. Otherwise, this film was very enjoyable."
4,Great old movie for the family.,A narated story of real life in the west as the wild animals were driven from the land as it was setteled. I watched it as a kid and never forgot it. Now my two boys love to watch it.
1,"TRASH , garbage OR NOT WORTH WASTING TIME ON.","trash..............horrible acting, if you want to call it thatjust plain STUPID.The Queen with the camera is toooooo much."
5,A clear path to spiritual knowledge,"The Infinite Way is the center of Joel Goldsmith's teachings, so this is the best place to start reading his work. He takes a no nonsense approach to spirituality, writing in clear, modern language that anyone can understand. Those who have a background in metaphysical practices, such as Christian Science, will find much that is familiar, along with new challenges and opportunities for spiritual growth. Those coming from a more traditional religious background may find his uncluttered approach to God refreshing."
3,It's about Divine providence all over again!,"Joel Goldsmith says that the natural man never receives a blessing from God. However it is written that Gods rains on the just and unjust alike. Much like the Apostle Paul, Mr. Goldsmith is an individual who believes himself to be an authority of the ""Truth"". He is also quick to criticize the teachings, methods and writings of other meta physicians just like Paul did in his heyday. His don't ask for anything, but be grateful and accept your lot in life approach to metaphysics is very simplistic and could be frowned upon as being reminiscent to the teachings of divine providence. However, that is open to interpretation. He does offer his own unique perspective on all things metaphysical often expanding on the writings of the Apostle Paul, but even he had personal beliefs that were often reflected in his writings that may in earnest either prevent or help someone seeking Christ Consciousness."
3,Well researched but lacks organization and objectivity,"Lankford collected a vast array of historical documents, newspaper articles, and book excerpts to author ""Richmond Burning."" Lankford's research goes well beyond what a typical civil war author has accomplished. He conveys the views and actions of military leaders, politicians, civilian bystanders, war profiteers, ex-slaves, spies, criminals, reporters, and soldiers of both sides. Unfortunately, the information Lankford has organized does not flow like a well written book should. He fits numerous pieces of research into an awkwardly fitting puzzle. Whether intentional or not, Lankford manipulates the research to convey a subtle disdain for ""white southerners"" who supported the Confederate cause. His love for the city of Richmond is vivid, however. The virtuous northern victory clearly outweighs social and economic decay that plagues much of the city today."
5,Great pillow....,"I wish I had this with my first son. Our baby is 3 months old and he loves it. He is inclined in it and he's quiet for long long periods of time when I put him in it. I guess he finds this new view of the world fascinating. He's also very snug in it, so no chance for him to roll over.I do wish the cover came off. It is a flannel type material, very soft but it can only be spot cleaned. My 16 month old ""kissed"" the baby and got chocolate milk on the cover that I had to clean up immediately (and I just received it today). :o)Other than the minor issue with the cover, I absolutely love it. My 3 month old is very tall for his age, so I'm sure I will no longer be able to use this in 2 months, but it will have been worth it."
2,Why do they make this thing?,"I purchased this item after having a tough time getting my daughter comfortable in her bassinet and reading success stories posted on this site. Yet when the item arrived there are huge stickers all over it warning parents to not let their child sleep on the product. I was so worried that I never used it and ended up getting rid of it. On the positive side, it is nice and soft and looked comfy!"
1,not that great,"If you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation, this item is not for you. Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her. She was bored to tears (literally) every time we put her in the lounger (the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting). I thought it was a cool concept, however, my daughter did not. She did much better in her papasan, or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to, but have the option to look around and play as well. Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter."
4,It is pretty good.,"My son doesn't like to sit still much, but he will lay here when he does. The only problem is that my three year old and my cat like it too."
5,A huge help.,"This item has been a big help. Sometimes, my newborn doesn't want to be in her crib but I cannot always hold her so I put her next to me on the lounger. It also is a great place to put her down when I need to do something in the same room. On another note, my dog thinks it is his new bed...so I would also recommend this as a dog bed for dogs under 10 pounds. They fit perfectly in the middle of it."
5,Better Than Expected,"Was advertised as used and it came ""new""... so... bonus.... used to love this cartoon when i was a little kid.DVD works fine... would recommend."
1,An Absurd Ripoff.,"I am shocked at the good reviews posted about this travesty. To even suggest this lame knock-off of The Real Ghostbusters was better than He-Man and She-Ra is sacriledge of the highest order.I remember watching this terrible, terrible show and literally laughing out loud at its poor animation and lame plots. I would tape episodes to show my friends, so we could all get a good chuckle out of the depths to which a once-proud company had sunk.The jokes were unfunny, the voice acting mediocre and mailed-in, and the plotlines moronic. Truly one of the worst animated series of all time, Filmation's Ghostbusters demands to be relegated to the dustbin of history, not preserved on DVD.Avoid this tripe, and order DVDs of The Real Ghostbusters instead. Though Filmation's Ghostbusters existed since the 1970s, they had more than worn out their welcome by the time 1986 rolled around. Watching these pathetic animated ripoffs with their second-rate production values is an exercise in masochism."
2,"No verb, mod,delay at once","This unit sounds great. Great VERB, MODULATION, AND DELAY. . HOWEVER. .does ZOOM not realize that some guitarists want ALL THREE in their sound at the same time??. . thats a no brainer. .ESPECIALLY by now in 2010. . . you can have two of the three simultaneously. . but not all three. . in a pedal that is SUPPOSEDLY designed for performance. . .that is RIDICULOUS. .shame on ZOOM. I have to link a separate CHORUS pedal to have CHORUS,DELAY AND VERB AT THE SAME TIME. . shame on ZOOM."
2,"Jack of all trades, master of none","I had high hopes for this effect based on the reviews here. In practice it turned out to be rather mediocre for the most part.Things I like about it:* Great price* Nice drum machine* Good Tuner* Variety of effectsThe cons include:* Using the drum machine turns the reverb/delay effects off* Reverb and delay effects are in the same ""block"" and cannot be used in the same time* Most of the factory presets sound very artificial* The output requires a splitter Y-cable* The controls have so many functions it is hard to navigate without the manual* Cheap preamp - the preamp compresses a lot and is easy to overdrive when playing loud. This is a major problem if you want to preserve the dynamics of your playing.In general, if you have a good-sounding guitar and hope to enhance it, this effect is not for you. It offers many but mediocre effects and the preamp really kills the dynamics."
1,wrong price,i bought this pedal because it was at an excellent price but when it arrived the invoice said that what was charged to my account was more than $60 over what the price said that it was. I dont know how they justify this but i very disappointed with this service
3,Good addition to my pedal rig,"Has plenty of customizable presets, some of which are quite good. Overall, had better results with my acoustic than with my Yamaha acoustic-electric nylon string. Initially, I had mixed feelings about the Zoom A2, but after getting acquainted with the user interface I now feel it's a welcome addition to my rig. Actually, it has displaced the much more expensive (and over-hyped?) TC Electronic G Natural. If it were lost, I'd get a new one."
3,A Crazy Godzilla Feature,"I saw this movie, and it was really, really boring, and only about 1 minute to 2 minutes long. All what happens is Bambi is eating grass, and then Godzilla puts his foot down, and stamps Bambi down, and well kills him. I reccomend just buying this or renting Godzilla And Other Classic Movie Monsters, because this film was so short they squeezed it into the dvd."
3,Hilarious,"I saw this and it kept me laughing for a long time. It's the funniest thing ever to be made, but I'm going to have to give it a 3/5 because it had other old cartoon clips which made up the rest of the tape which are just stupid. But like I said, Bambi Meets Godzilla is hilarious and if I were just to rate that clip, it would get a 5/5"
3,Crazy Cartoons,This mad house collection of old insane cartoons will leave you puzzled some of them allthough are just too insane for liking most of the time you have little idea of whats going on
2,Boring,"Lots of supposedly spontaneous pictures of a naked woman and her sidekicks. Not really a digital diary, but a collection of self consciously off the wall comments and photos. Pretty much like you would see in any 'hip' contemporary magazine. And about as artificial. Totally lacking context. There is no substantive autobiographical sketch, no pictures of Natachas's neighborhood. Could have had something here. I wouldn't mind reading the authors memoir if she could be bothered to write something meaningful. On the plus side, she is pretty cute and you do get to see her naked."
2,"Initially interesting, but ultimately cheap digital porn.","Benedikt Taschen, in all his wisdom, knew a book of a reasonably attractive 22 year old woman engaged in sexual acts with other women, herself, and men would sell. Why not package it a a grand treatise of sex in the age of the internet, bind it in a pretty cover, and charge 29 bucks and call it art? While the pictures are quite sexy, the book has the shelf life of this month's Penthouse. The content is equally as interesting. It's not art, just well packaged and well laid out porn. Save your cash, check out the web site."
1,Lame and Pretentious,"Natacha Merritt unfortunately relied on two assumptions to carry this book: 1. That using a digital camera would make her pornography more relevant to the computer generation, and 2. That her self-absorbed preoccupation with her body would hold people's attention for 160 pages. She was wrong on both accounts. Digital pornography is no more appealing than analog pornography, and no one can look at Ms. Merritt's body for more than fifteen pages max without becoming bored speechless. The end result of Ms. Merritt's efforts is a lame and pretentious collection of photographs that only her mother would be interested in. After skimming the first few pages, the novelty of having someone's ""digital diary"" in your hands will have lost its appeal, and you'll have wished that you had spent your (...) elsewhere."
2,"I guess I just don't ""get it""","The written parts of this book are pure gibberish, and offer no insight at all into the photographsthe pictures themselves are often pointless, or one thumbnail sized picture on a full page, just weird things like that. There might be 10 good pictures in the whole book.I guess you're supposed to be so blown away at the idea that a girl would take a pic of herself giving a BJ that you're supposed to just say you love the whole book or something, I don't know. 10 seconds on google image search will find you sexier photos than are in this collection, although i admit the lighting and composition in some of them are quite goodOverall, i see it as a waste of time and money. The introduction especially is almost aggressively unhelpful, and seems more an exercise in name dropping than anything else"
3,The Neuromancer of Photography,"Natacha Merritt's book suffers the misfortune of being profoundly passe just five years or six years after its publication. It's hard to even judge this in 2006. Readers need to remember that in terms of technology, the world has changed dramatically since Merritt's book was published. Digital photography is not the 'coming thing' anymore; it defines modern photography. Risque, overtly sexual photography captured in the coarse, low-res digital formats of five years ago was intriguing at the time. Now, it just looks like a bad (or actually quite good) amateur porn site. One must credit Natacha Merritt for creating something that, at the time, was very provocative. However, the rest of the world caught up to her very quickly, and what was radical and provocative in 2000 now makes her look like the William Gibson of the art world."
2,Nothing special,"I have seen my share of erotic photography books, and this one did nothing for me for the most part. Sure, there were a few interesting camera angles, and (I'm not familiar with photo ""lingo""....) some nice ""smokey"" images(?), but for the most part, I found this to be more ""porn"" than ""art""."
2,lame,"SO, to share pictures in massive quantities is called art by the publishers. The book does not offer anything interesting other than exploit voyeurism, not even political feminist views. LAME."
2,Empty,"Essentially, it's just another Taschen photobook - lots of soft porn with a veneer of high art about it. It's not at all a 'diary', or particularly candid or real, as the author admits that the photographs are posed (with the encouragement of Eric Kroll), and that they do not portray actual situations. There's lots of dated-sounding text that breathlessly uses words such as 'downloading' and 'logging-in', as if they were extraordinarily cool, and although it's not quite as bad as anything by David Hamilton, it's essentially a glorified 'Penthouse' shoot, or an Eric Kroll book but with a digital camera. As for the digital nature of the photographs, so what? A camera's a camera."
1,"Highly explicit, yet unexciting, and poor photography","The images in this book are highly explicit. What's amazing though is that they are boring and unexciting. If you're considering this book because you think you'll be excited by the explicit photos, you'll be very disappointed. Even the lingerie section of the JC Penny catalog is much more exciting, and it's free. If you're considering this book because you're interested in cuting edge photography, you'll be even more disappointed, as the images show an almost complete lack of talent."
2,A DULL MORASS OF SELF-INDULGENCE AND SEXUAL NARCISSISM,"OK NATACHA, THE CONCEPT WAS AN INTRIGUNG ONE: A YOUNG WOMAN EMBARKS ON A SEXUAL JOURNEY AND TAKES HER DIGITAL CAMERA ALONG FOR THE RIDE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE RESULT IS AND UNIMAGINATIVE EXHIBITION OF SEXUAL CONCEIT. GRANTED SOME OF THE IMAGES TURNED ME ON (SHE IS PRETTY HOT AND LOOKS GOOD NAKED) BUT NO MORE THAN A PEEK THROUGH ANY TRENDY S/M OR HARD CORE MAGAZINE OUT THERE. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT MS MERRITT STOPPED IN AT THE LOCAL PORN SHOP, GATHERED THE MOST SHOKING ACCESSORIES SHE COULD FIND, AND THEN ROUNDED UP HER LOVERS/MODELS/WHATEVERS AND STOPPED IN AT THE ROYALTON TO TAKE MARKETABLE PHOTOGRAPHS. SERIOIUSLY LACKING IN SUBSTANCE AND REEKING OF THE DESIRE TO SELL SEX, NOT EXPLORE IT'S MORE VIVID DEPTHS."
1,Very academic book,This book seems like it was written straight out of the Manuals.In short it seems like the editor cut+paste straight out of the Manuals. The author does not seem to have real world experience of configuring security on routers for a large ISP like [a phone company]. Good if you want to crack exams but not if you want to keep your job.
1,More of the typical pap.,"Tobar has reached the zenith of the popular culture's willful blindness relative to the issue of illegal immigration. He cleverly uses romantic hyperbole and disingenuous analogies to blur the reader's recollection of the last time they needed an emergency room - now transformed to the illegals' HMO - or had to move to a distant suburb to obtain a quality education for their children. Yes, this is a nation of immigrants. It is one, however, which has historically achieved hegemony of fundamental values creating the greatest and most free nation on the planet. Subverting those values rather than embracing them will ensure the ruination of why the illegals try so hard to come here in the first place. (Written by not an ""Anglo"" but an American; thank you very much...)"
1,Useless,"All this information could be simply found online. Also, the flavor text is flavor-less... Dr. Oz is much more interesting! Buy You: The Owner's Manual instead =D"
1,typical right-wing hate speech,"This book is a good example of right-wing hate speech. This is the last thing our country needs. the author is a misogynist, homophobe, racist, etc. The Republican party should wake up and run these hatemongers out the their party."
5,an excelent book,"This is a excelent book for consevatives. It is written in a simpe sense for the beginner but deals with issues interesting to any well versed poltical reader. I simply loved reading this book, it was hard to put down."
4,"The world needs more ""Dartmouth Reviews""","In its stated purpose of ""mentoring"" college-aged, or younger, conservatives, this book does a fine job in introducing its target audience to many of the distinctive elements of traditional conservative thought. It's not a perfect book, and maybe someday I'll write a column somewhere about how D'Souza fundamentally mis-states the libertarian philosophy, and libertarian beliefs on some key issues. In that section, at least, he does his young friend ""Chris"" a real disservice. It's only because that's such a relatively small part of the book that I'm not downgrading my ranking more.But apart from that (and the author's annoying idolatry -- it's not too strong a word -- of Lincoln), there is much here to learn from and enjoy. If campus conservatives can arm themselves with the information -- and also the techniques -- D'Souza passes along here, the political atmosphere of our colleges will be much improved, and much more entertaining."
1,"The usual silly sophistry from ""Distort D'Newza""","D'Souza reprises his role as the Gunga Din of the far right-wing. His knowledge of American history, politics, literature and culture is so slim as to be laughable. Those very conservatives who feather his nest are the very same people who fought tooth-and-nail against the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, which eliminated racial and ethnic discrimination in U.S. immigration policies - and without which, D'Souza himself probably would have been denied the right to be here."
5,recommended reading for young east coast conservatives,A liberal friend turning more conservative bought this for me since we were constantly arguing. It is difficult to be a young conservative on the east coast (there is an absurd notion that all conservatives are bible belt folk). Absolutely insightful and dense reading.
4,All Round Arguments,"This book doesn't focus on one issue, but tackles a bunch of relevant topics that most everyone can relate to. It provides sound arguments mixed with humor that keep the reader involved. Most importantly, it articulates arguments clearly and provides someone new to conservatism the basic premise of what it means to be a conservative. This is basically a conservative hand book, and it does an excellent job of defining conservative viewpoints."
1,Hypocrite gets caught at the NO-TELL MOTEL!,This guy is a right wing zealot who would have been sitting at the back of the bus in 1950's Mississippi for all his embracing of conservative values. I have not read his book and would not give this crackpot hypocrite one dime of my hard earned money. Funny how conservatives who are always yelling about the lack of morality are usually brought down by illicit sex.Note to Mr. D'Souza please divorce your wife before you start introducing your mistress as your fiancee!!!
2,Entertaining but lacking something...,"I was expecting a bit more from Dinesh D'Souza, while the book touches several themes at the core of American Conservatism it was dissapointing in that it somewhat pandered to a style of writing similar to Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. Basically, it could have had more depth."
3,Mediocre thought,"Ideology aside - if this is possible - this book's success with you depends on who you are. For people without much time to read political philosophy in depth, this popular, down-to-earth approach to giving rationale for an ideological set may strike the reader as a breath of fresh air. This is bestseller material, and I mean this in all of the derogatory senses of the word. If you are a person who wants to be challenged, you will find this condescending and stultifying - unless it only poorly reformulates what you already believe. Very oversimplified thinking and ridiculing slander of the other camp - good for reconvincing the shallow among the convinced."
3,"Good, adult entertainment.","While it seems a bit high-brow, the actors do an excellent job, and the ladies costumes alone make it worth watching. Good, adult entertainment."
5,A neglected classic,"This almost forgotten film is a must-see for the wonderful and subtle performances of Leslie Howard (one of his best ever) and the underrated Ann Harding (she has top billing!) -- and Myrna Loy shows that she can be convincing in an unsympathetic role. Leni Stengel is so good in a small role that I wanted to see more of her, and Ilka Chase is hilarious as a hanger-on.The screenplay is written by and for adults -- little is stated outright, much is implied. I've seen this several times on late night TV, and I've never tired of it. I'm glad I now own the Alpha DVD, which is very good for a 1932 film.Note: the check Leslie Howard receives from his father is for $100,000 -- you can just make out the amount when Howard puts it on the mantel. That's equivalent to more than $1.5 million in today's money!"
3,It's okay,"I liked the movie because it has Myrna Loy. But I am a happy endings sort of person, so I didn't care for the ending. But, over all it is okay to watch."
2,Great Story,"...but viewing this DVD is horrible. I bought this with some trepidation since it an Alpha studio copy and they are not exactly known for their high quality transfers (IMO) but unfortunately they seem like the only game in town when trying to get these older movies on DVD. Going by some of the other reviews in here saying it is the best Alpha transfer they'd seen, I bought this DVD. The story is top notch. No problem. But I expected more quality than what's on this DVD. Highlights were very washed out to the point where you could hardly distinguish the faces so don't expect even a good transfer with this DVD. Mediocre maybe. Unless I happened to get a really poorly manufactured DVD i couldn't rate this any higher (and that's only due to the story)."
2,album name confusion,"I ordered this album, thinking I was getting ""What Wondrous Love Is This"" by Michelle Tumes. Wrong. I received the Moments-Devotions-Songs compilation edition, with no praying hands on the cover. It contains entirely different songs. I have many albums on the Sparrow Records label, and this is probably their poorest choice of album name and design scheme. To make it more confusing, Sparrow printed BOTH song lists on the back cover of my album, implying there were two discs included. The actual songs included in this ""Moments"" compilation:1- Susan Ashton - Body & Soul2- Christine Dente - Constant3- Margaret Becker - Clay And Water4- Twila Paris - Fountain Of Grace5- Kim Hill - In You Alone6- Cheri Keaggy - You Take Me There7- Jana Potter - Reason Enough8- Sierra - Pray For Me9- Nichole Nordeman - Wide Eyed10- Michelle Tumes - Heaven Will Be Near Me"
5,York's New York is great all week,"I really regret not discovering this salute to New York City until five years after it was issued. Libby York gives versions of ""Midnight Sun,"" ""In the Wee Small Hours,"" ""That's All,"" and ""Like Someone in Love"" that are every bit as good as June Christy, Frank Sinatra and other 20th Century greats did. This lady's a real pro, and with the help of pianist Renee Rosnes, saxophonist Frank Wess, drummer Billy Drummond and bassist Todd Coolman, she produced a winner with this, her second CD."
2,disappointed,Another edition with a better editor and decent maps to illustrate the text would make this a much more interesting and useful book. Lay people will have difficulty following the paragraph-long lists of ancient cities and tribes.
1,At least the design is good.,"The book examines the development of a compositional trend nobody but this obscure and self-important author recognizes or really cares about. It might contain some valuable information for those willing to wade through Connors' bombastic pseudo-victorian prose. The cover is lovely, though."
2,Photoshop CS2 Before & After Makeovers Taz Tally,"A disappointment, I expected more. Details a little muddy, hard to follow in area's, I wasted time trying to figure out steps that had been missed. This is not a book I would purchase again; there are better more detailed books out there."
2,Some interesting characters but way too slow,"I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book."
4,"Unique story, quick read","This is one of those books that follows the lives of a limited number of idiosyncratic people (otherwise known as a ""character study""). As I am particularly fond of the ""character study"" genre, I found this book to be an enjoyable, quick read. It might be a bit outdated to the modern reader, but...""nifty""...nonetheless. Buy it used for a reasonable price."
4,Spooky...kooky...ooky... the Wapshot Family,"Entertaining and funny. These folks are as dysfunctional as the rest of us.Easy to read. No heavy stuff, as might be suggested by the title. I can see Steve Martin in a role of the movie."
3,Disappointed,"While I love Cheever's prose, I expected more in this highly acclaimed novel. I just couldn't get into the characters or the story."
1,Very disappointing,"I'm sorry, but this sequel to the movie (not Philip K. Dicks' classic novel) misses the mark by a large margin. The ludicrous way in which two characters who quite obviously died previously (J. F. Sebastian and Pris) are suddenly brought back to life in this installment is laughable. The characterisations of Dave Holden and Deckard are as wooden as Keanu Reeves and the whole thing moves along as though its feet are stuck in concrete. There are some nice ideas at work here (Holdens rescue for example) but overall it just seems like a tired excuse for cashing in on the Blade Runner phenomenon. Avoid."
1,Thoughts on Edge of Human,"Sadly this is a book I abandoned reading. A sequel to Blade Runner that didn't need to happen, and not very fun to read."
3,"Not a bad attempt, but...","So people have wanted a sequel to Blade Runner the movie for some time. Ever since the director's cut (which was the better version IMHO), people have wondered if there was ever supposed to be a sequel since the happy ending in the theatrical version wasn't supposed to happen. Now, Jeter has given people what some thought they wanted: a sequel to Blade Runner that combines elements of both the movie and the book, and takes advantages of some of the mistakes that were made (the missing sixth replicant-actually scripted, but was cut out of the final filming because of budget constraints). Not a bad read, but Blade Runner fans (particularly those of the book) will most likely be disappointed. If you're a fan of the film, you might like it. Like Dick's writing style, it is moody, depressing, and uneven, but when Dick did it, it worked. When Jeter does it, it's only average."
4,Thank god someone wrote a sequal,"I am so happy that somebody actually wrote a sequal to one of the greatest SF films ever made (considering that there will be no movie sequal...). And this book does justice to the blade runner world by adding more for us to follow with Rick Deckard and his life. Mr. Jeter did a fine job with the legacy that PK Dick left and I'd just like to say how glad I am that the freaky-near-future, apocolyptic, world-in-chaos science-fiction genre lives on...especially with a detective like Rick Deckard."
3,Sciance Fiction Thriller,"Twisting Plot, Great Atmosphere, fast paced action. Great to see the characters from the Blade Runner again. Would make a great movie plot, and that is probably what lets this book down a little. A little short, a bit more scope maybe a bit more theater and background. A few more questions answered. Otherwise a great read"
1,DONT waste your money,"Maybe I needed a more updated one?? If you're ready to go dumpster diving and send your kids to school with socks on their hands, this is the book for you!! RIDICULOUS!!"
4,Great book but needs an update and discuss savings online,"This is a book full of wonderful ideas but falls short on how to save big bucks by using the Internet. Websites like Amazon. and Tightwadsales offer fantastic savings on everyday items normal people purchase, especially electronics and books. Other than not having a section on saving on the Internet it's a great book."
2,The Tightwad Gazette ll : Promoting Thrisft as a Vuabke Alternative Lifestyle,The book was poorly organized and a great deal was outdated information or just not really new. I would not recommend this book and was glad that I bought it used and not new.
1,depressing,"A well-meaning but painfully insecure young teacher slowly - painfully slowly - falls apart and eventually commits an unrealistic suicide by climbing from the driver's seat into the back seat of her car that experieces no road friction. Absurd, painful to watch and utterly pointless. Don't waste your time."
3,Your heart goes out to her...,An at times hard to watch little film about a socially insecure young woman trying to make a new life in a new city and finding many difficulties. I was instantly struck by the low budget look and feel of this film and it did take awhile to adjust to sets which seemed hastily put together and the oft times confused camera angles. The other reviews here do a good job summing up what goes on throughout the story. I might not re-watch this one for a long time.
5,EXCELLENT book,"This book is very well written in a way that is easy to grasp. For me at least, this is a book I can sit down and just read. It is very thorough, and provides a lot of information on how linguistics works, what it is, and explains the technical terms providing exampels mostly in english, but also uses some latin and compares English with German some at one point. It goes through some of the major theories and schools of thought and also different applications for linguistics. For example, it talks about psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics, which are fields of psychology and sociology concerning language. It also talks about the anthropological, literary, and other applications and fields of linguistic science. I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in language."
5,An excellent introduction to a fascinating subject,"It's challenging to write a textbook that accurately and clearly explains a technical subject to technical readers. It's much more difficult to write a book that accurately and clearly explains a technical subject to a lay audience. In this book Aitchison has done a fantastic job of the latter, giving a breezy, well-written, and technically accurate survey of the field of linguistics. (He lost me a little bit only at the end, when he got into the details of Chomsky's theories.)I have read other popular books on linguistics (which I have also enjoyed) but was looking for the more academic treatment provided here. Besides giving a brief survey of several aspects of linguistics, Aitchison also provides an extensive bibliography with pointers of further reading.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about this field!"
2,for our dogs,"we bought this for our two large dogs to try in their water bowls before i brought our newborn home, and then once she was here to try to relax them a bit. we tried several different doses and did not notice any difference. i'm sure it's a good product, but for our purpose, we were not satisfied."
4,Skeptical at first---but seems to work,"I purchased this at the advice of a friend. I wanted something natural (non-medicinal) to take before flying for anxiety. My flight is not until March '11, but wanted to test it out. I used it before a couple of dentist appointments, and it seemed to work. I was not as anxious and I seemed more calm and was able to have the dental work done that I needed. The dose is only 4 drops in a little water or straight on your tongue. The test will come on my trip in March. I will take it before my flights and keep it with me to take in-flight (it's an overseas flight). I'll post an update after I return."
1,Nothing!,I should have paid attention to the other reviews before purchasing. Would not buy again. I tried it on a rescue dog who was very scared - I saw no difference in my dog after using this product.
3,rescue remedy,"I have not used the product yet, but as far as delivery and accuracy of the product itself were fine. The reason I rated it a 3 star is because I have not used it yet. I'm hoping my cat calms down by himself."
5,BEST THING ON THE MARKET,"I have panic attacks a lot and was looking for something that could help me. A friend of mine turned me onto this product. After I read hundreds of reviews I finally got some. With just a couple sprays or drops I felt a lot more calm. I could really tell the difference. My heart raced a lot less then normal and my nervousness has been a lot less. It also doesn't taste bad either. I highly recommend this product. Oh, also I am a nagger but while taking this I don't pick arguments(Great for the wife or husband.lol) The product also doesn't leave you feeling dopey or sluggish. The best way that I can describe this product is that it makes the little things that might work you up not bother you."
4,Inspirational ideas!,"This book is a great compilation of the ""best of"" her Weddings magazine for those who do not currently subscribe to her magazine. Her ideas are always inspirational! Even though some of her ideas or backdrops appear too posh for middle America, her ideas can easily be adapted to your budget and your taste. Creative ideas for table settings, room decor, floral arrangements, wedding favors and much more. And, as always, the still photography is exquisite and adds to the inspiration. A must read!"
5,"GREAT book, buy it you will be happy you did","Really a great book, comprehensive and a great read. I really found the book soooo helpful even 1 month before my wedding, I only wish I had bought it earlier. Totally worth the 35 dollars just to have a comprehensive guide in one place to planning a wedding, Martha thinks of it all!Enjoy and happy wedding planning!"
4,Sumptuous visual compilation,A remarkable visual compilation of Martha's best wedding-related craft and decor ideas; Exquisite still photography for inspiration; A truly enjoyable book to learn from and to share with family and friends who will one day find themselves in your shoes.
3,Old but good,"The book was in a quite good situation. It is a little bit old, but it is OK because in general it is very clean.The book store was also very responsive to my emails."
5,Weddings,"I find this book to be very helpful, especially with money saving ideas. The suggestions in this book are very simple, yet elegant. I recommend this book to any bride that wants her wedding day to be special."
1,Overpriced and thin gruel,I bought this for someone planning a wedding and they did not like it. There are better books.
5,Beautiful,This book is beautiful. The pictures are great and there are a ton of ideas in it. I am having an outdoor wedding in September/October and I could not have bought a better book. There are ideas about everything from the flowers to soaps to put in the bathroom during the reception. I am using quite a few of the ideas I found in the book. Love it Love it Love it
5,One of the MOST BEAUTIFUL books of the kind,"Excellent! Fresh ideas, beautiful ideas, astonishing decorations, so simple and grandiose at the same time. Beautifully matching colors. Nothing's too much. Nothing's inappropriate. Everything's of great taste. Even the gowns are so well presented. The pictures are fabulous. I particularly enjoyed the bouquets, the cakes and the stationery section. I have to say that I really appreciate the planner. It is very helpful and useful. I enjoyed every minute studying it!"
5,Simple an elegant,"The first time I used was for my own wedding at the beach; and the second time we are actually using for my younger sister's wedding in april. I find that little details is what made a wedding simple and elegant, and for that unforgettable for your guests and yourself."
4,Lots of pictures,Lots of colorful pictures. Lots of good ideas. Ideas are good for small wedding. Need lots of helpers.
1,Poor. There are better wedding books.,"I think these books are better:Bridal Guide Magazine's How to Plan the Perfect Wedding Without Going Broke, Weddings For Dummies, and Bridal Bargains: Secrets to Throwing a Fantastic Wedding on a Realistic Budget by Denise Fields, Alan Fields."
2,not what I expected,"this video guide didn't help me at 4 cell stage xenopus embryo injection. not clear at all in this part. other sections, I'm not sure."
3,realistic relationships,"Though not as good as the first book in the series, Breaking Up is Really, Really Hard to Do is still pretty good. Mads, Lina, and Holly are back, and so is the Dating Game. Mads uses an art project to try and get closer to Sean, Lina creates a fake identity in order to talk to Dan on a dating web-site, and Holly decides to break up with Rob, wondering if it's the right decision. This series truly illustrates the hardships of high school."
4,Pretty good,"I am an adult who loves reading ""teen fiction"". I picked up the first book in this series by fluke but I have found myself running after the second and third books.This series is fun to read. While it does not really tackle many of the daily problems encountered by teens today - or should I say the book does tackle them, but never in any type of serious way, the storylines are cute and witty.If I had a teen, I would have no problem suggesting these titles. I look forward to more in this series."
1,Only Took One Pack,"I ordered these from a different site years ago (2008). Since I have issues with spontaneous anxiety, I wanted to avoid taking the noortropic pill. I called the company (Universal) and they refused to tell me which pill was the noortropic pill so I could avoid it. They said that since their formula is proprietary, they can't tell which pill is which except for the caffeine. I tried one pack but the not-knowing bugged (and frankly scared) me to the point where I sent it back. If you have the ingredients listed on the can (which they do) I don't see what the secret is in telling paying customers which pill performs which function. For that reason, I will not ever buy another product from this company."
1,Animal Cuts,Works for a couple days ...pretty much get the exxcess water out of your body...after that not much. You do have a little extra energy...but when you eat anything with surgar....it appears your body wants more then normal...Animal Cuts 42 pckt
2,weak,Who are we kidding? Its not the real deal. Youd might as well drink 2 cups of coffee before you hit the gym
3,romo72,"i review this item whit 3 stars because they take to long to arrived, i bought this whit a pair of boots and a pair of gloves, they arrived 2 weeks ago and i still dont get the vitamins......... to bad!!! i wont buy again from that company"
1,Too many pills,Too many pills! The individual baggies were nice but it was just too much and I never really saw any improvement. Stay away.
2,Its Alright?,Its pretty decent product. i took it faithfully ill admit some days i worked harder then other days. but im not sure i had rollercoaster results. some days i tried taking out the blue pills(Diuretic complex) and i wouldnt see any results. you know? so not sure if its just a fancy water pill. because they couple pounds i did lose its stayed off so thats pretty good. but that i thought was kinda weird. the size and quantity isn't bad.
4,Weekly Review #1,"This is week one day two of using the product. It is quick to work, when I worked out my muscles got sore for very short periods of time. I normally work uppers body one day, abs another, and lower body on day three, but I finished my upper body work out so fast that I just worked everything. So I'd give it 5 stars on the energy boostHowever, at the end of my workout I had one of the worst stomach aches I've ever had, I felt it earlier in the day, but It did not really kick in until I took the second pack and a few hours afterward. I sat down for almost 15 mins before I do bare to stand and walk home. That didn't matter to me much maybe it does to you. I'll keep posting as the continue to use the product"
5,Every little bit helps,"Bottom line:If you want to lose fat you should gain muscle: eat right and lift heavy shit, free weights! Not machines, not cardio.Example: Follow StrongLifts 5x5.When I used animal cuts I only had access to crappy machines and a treadmill. I used both 3 times a week while cutting, and it did work pretty well, I could see some definition showing up in my stomach area. I have the feeling that it was mostly water weight though and my results would have been considerably greater had I been lifting heavy with free weights. I could have probably gotten about the same results using cheaper water weight cutting products instead."
5,Best Fat burner,"This is great supp to burn fat feel energized ,gives you ton of energy on your workouts you feel like a beast .Honestly I started seeing results on 5th day.Like every morning I woke up and saw fat melting away well this was help of my diet and workout You will lose all the water weight you have in you.Some people pay 20-40 bucks for supps for water loss but this does it all.Fat burning energizing amazing product .Once again Universal done it again .I tried so many fat burners so far the best one.I'm not affiliated with Universal but I tried all the Universal supps that why I'm leaving reviews on them.I did 4 cycles of this stuff.just perfect for cutting cycle."
1,poor,didnt do anything but make me have to go to the bathroom 3 times an hour. this stuff cant be healthy..
3,Ehh,I have not been on this product long enough to be able to make a good call on whether it is working or not yet.
2,Didn't seem to do much,"I've used a number of Universal products in the past and been pretty happy with them, expecially Animal Pump. But Cuts didn't seem to do anything for me other than give me some energy from the caffine. I work out twice a day, cardio @ lunch and weights after work and I didn't see any change while taking these. My advice would be to save your money and spend it on creatine or whey protein."
3,Product could be better,"I wasn't too impressed by this product. I thought it could be better. The pill taking was not that bad i was able to take them all at once. During my workouts i would sweat like crazy! i liked that because it would help me get a better workout. It didnt provide too much energy except on the first day. It did make my arms and other muscles more cut, but didnt lose too much weight. The bads about this product is it makes you really hungry. Thats not really good if your trying to lose weight. overall all i gave the product a 3. they could boost the energy levels and if it would suppress your hunger it would be even better."
4,"Not a miracle drug, but gives an edge","There's no such thing as getting results from doing nothing. This product isn't a substitute for hard work. However, this product WILL give you better results for the hard work you put in.If you can manage the sweatier workouts and the initial rush of the stimulants, this product is great for that extra boost in results."
5,Works well,"I lost 3.5"" off of my waist in the 3 weeks I was on Animal Cuts. I could tell my body temp. was up. The only negative side effects were thirst (and associated frequent peeing) and my burps tasting like cayanne pepper. Oh, and I'd get jittery if I took the morning dose and drank coffee but didn't eat - only made that mistake once.You won't lose weight just from popping the pills; you have to exercise and reduce your portion sizes. If you do those two things, though, Animal Cuts will amplify your fat loss."
3,not so cut as i thought,"im an animal fan and. so far all the products i have taken have working. i dont fell the cut effect in this, in fact not even 2 cansi guees we all have different genetics. maybe dor some works. for others dont"
4,Just Finished Can!,I noticed some differences. Increased energy at the gym and overall weightloss without really altering my diet. Would buy again. Probably right now.
4,JIHAD JOE,this supplement is great - the caffine .i actually noticed a small change after taking two serving then working out when i woke up i noticed alot of water weight removed product works the only side effect is sleep irritation and a euphoric type of feeling .all and all i will be buying more .
5,Does the job,"One of the best supplements I have ever tried for cutting. It has everything you need for a cutting cycle, all in one convenient pack. For me it is a little difficult having to take so many pills at once, but that is common for the Universal brand. I will definitely taking this product again after the holidays are over."
4,Great cutter,"Work out, eat right and this product will really help you cut down. Used it once and was really satisfied with the results. Do not take the second dose after 12 or so because you might experience some difficulty sleeping. Overall, great product. Can't wait to try it again."
1,Not 4 me,"Made my testicles hurt after u packages. May hve been just me , but i stopped taking them after day 2"
2,PAIN,"I wanted to try this product due to the great reviews from Amazon and [...]. I wasn't prepared for all the pills (like 18/day). But not a problem. I rec'd the product quickly and it was in good shape.It's been about 5 days now and I can no longer take it. The directions say to take one packet upon waking and another one later in the day. If I take the pills on an empty stomach, my stomach feels as if its on FIRE. My usual routine is to wake up, take my supplements, work out, then grab a bite to eat. So unfortunately, this product is not for me."
3,Not very effective,"This product was good and bad. It says it will made you're body cut,which is not entirely true..The good part of animal cuts is that it will give you energy to keep you going throughout a long day.The disadvantage of this product is it is only a temporary weight loss product because it causes you to lose water weight..which comes right back once you are done with the product. Possibly if you followed the method it tells you on the back (3 weeks on it,1 week off) and used multiple purchases of the product it would work,but with one i noticed very little results.Hope this helped!Perry,IL"
4,I have used these twice,I didn't quite see the benefits I expected but I love the Animal products. These may work better for you. They are definitely worth a try.
3,Day By Day Analysis,"I will be giving updates daily and eventually weekly for my experience with this product. My initial rating is neutral (3 stars) as nothing bad, nor nothing noticeably better than any other fat burner I've tried.Day 1) It took about 30 minutes to consume all 9 pills in the 1st pack. 2 Hours later no jitters, no outrageous heart rate or none of the negative side effects described by some of the other users. I feel alert and energized, I took them on a full stomach."
5,Very satisfied,"This is a great product, it has done everything I hoped it would and more. I don't usually try supplements like these, I pretty much just stick to whey protein after a workout to help my muscles recover but I decided to try this product because a friend of mine used it and I did see results in him. My only qualm with this product is that I hadn't started using it earlier. Highly recommend this product."
1,Ineffective Product.,"Let me preface this by saying I am a big Animal products fan so needless to say I was incredibly disappointed at the quality or lack thereof of this product. Let me also say that this was just my personal experience with this product and yours may differ.I have been utilizing this product for 2 weeks now (bear in mind it's only a 3 week cycle at 2 packages a day) and I have noticed absolutely ZERO benefits from taking it. There is no increased energy, no increased strength, and let me be on record as saying there isn't even a placebo affect from taking this supplement. The only thing it does do is give me severe heartburn.To the company's credit they do offer a money back guarantee but like anything in life I think it's wrong to consume 2/3's of a product and then demand a refund. I will take this as lesson learned and stick with the Animal products that I KNOW work (i.e. Animal Pack)."
4,Good product,"When taking these, get ready to be amped up. I took these as directed, good product, definitely wakes you up and gets you going. I did lose a little weight while taking these, but by no means is this a miracle pill (which I knew before taking). But it gives you extra energy and if you eat right and do cardio, you can really shed weight. I am not a caffine drinker, or soda drinker, just milk and water and when taking these, they hit me hard with energy, even made me a little jittery. When I stopped taking these, I went through caffine withdrawl. Terrible headaches, did not feel well for about 3 to 4 days after. It felt like a bad hangover for 4 days. To avoid this, I suggest coming off slowly, reducing to one pack a day, and then one every other day so your body can get used to not having tons of caffine in it all the time. Other than that, it was great, will probably take again in the future."
1,So far only giving me HEARTBURN. Nothing else.,"Aug. 28, 2012I've taken Universal Products before (Animal Rage)but so far Animal CUTS is just not doing anything for me. I don't really feel any energy throughout the day or while I'm working out. I take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and it doesn't seem to have any effect on me. I do however feel heartburn. I've heard people say they start sweating like crazy and I'm not getting that either. I'm drinking lots of water.I'm 1-1/2 weeks into it. I'll update later see if something changes but as of right now I would NOT buy this product again.(update)12-07-2012I didn't get to finish the product. Tried to return it but Amazon does not refund supplements yet Universal has a complete money back guarantee. Oh well.I would not recommend this product. I do like other Universal Product but would pass on this one."
3,ehh it ok,i had read so many good reviews about animal cuts. so i tried it and it did a good job of stripping the water away but i only lost a few pounds if that my regiment is go to the gym five days a week countless miles in cardio and muscle ripping weights. gonna try oxyelite pro i still have atleast forty pounds to go. oh well
3,"Heard it was great, but no so much impressed.","I heard from a couple of my friends that animal cuts was awesome. Animal cuts is a trusted name so I figured I would give it a shot. It was ok. There was a huge amt of pills which was ok, but kind of annoying. I have taken a few different fat burners that I had far better results. Methyl burn elite takes the prize for me. With any supplement what you put into it is what you get out. You cant sit on your butt and expect to loose weight. I increased my cardio and tweaked my diet and had great results with methyl burn. I only lost three pounds with animal cuts"
1,Don't Believe Product Description,"Animal Cuts does not live up to it's description. I never even felt it kick in. I looked puffier than usual. Felt groggy because the stimulating effects were insignificant. It does not decrease your appetite. It's a dud. I usually don't recommend another competitors product in a review because it will be perceived as if a the competitor is posting a fake review just to drum up sales - with that said, I am not in any way affiliated with USP Labs, but I highly recommend OxyElite Pro. It works, hands down. You will feel the energy, it kills your appetite, and you will see a difference on the scale and in the mirror. I'm not sure why I switched to Animal Cuts perhaps I got caught up by the hype - but it was an expensive mistake that I will never make again. Sorry if this review seems like a sales pitch for OXY, but it's not - I just swear by it."
4,Now I know who to call,I'm not sure how long the blow-up backpack will hold up but my grandson is loving it and there is not a single ghost left in my house.
4,Decent costume,It ran small and was tight but my son loved it. The back was pretty large but he didn't have any issues with it. He wore this costume several times to many parties and it survived 3 washings between them.
1,Proton Pack Held no air,"We ordered the costume and included blow up proton pack. The Proton pack would not hold air, so was non-usable for the costume."
4,who ya gonna call...!!,"This was purchased for my 6 yr old grandson. He loves the movies and wears the custume several days each week playing the part. The only problem with the costume is it runs small. We had bought a larger size than what he wears and the body was still short. Overall though, it's a winner!!"
2,WOW,"PRODUCT COMES TOO BIG. I GOT MY SON (WHICH IS 3) A SMALL AND IT CAN FIT MY 7 YEAR OLD WITH NO PROBLEM. NOT MADE WELL. LOOKS LIKE IT WILL TEAR UP EASILY. NOT WORTH IT FOR THE MONEY I PAID, PLUS I HAVE TO ALTER THE COSTUME JUST FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD TO FIT IN IT. THE BEST THING ABOUT THE COSTUME IS THE BLOW UP PLASTIC PROTON PACK."
2,"cheap made,and YELLOW","Any ghost buster fan knows the jumpsuit is not yellow,well theirs is! Its also cheap made-but what costume isnt? I bought this for my 4 yr old son (in a small 4-6) and I have to roll the pants up-prob gonna hem them so it is a bit long and my 4 yr old is tall. Overall though my son is having a blast in it and Im sure it will be a hit for halloween.Just be warned it IS yellow."
2,Son loved it,My son loved this costume. It held up well. The pack was a wonderful addition. He was the only Ghostbuster in his school.
4,Costume,I am Pleased with the accuracy of size and how it is similar to what the characters in the movie wear.
4,"great product, perhaps a little too much for your average bike","overall, I am very happy with this product. However, the lock is indeed quite heavy and I feel the added security is not worth the additional weight. The security cable is a nice added feature. Although I am not unsatisffied with the product I might suggest getting a lower model instead."
2,Not Very Durable,"I used this lock to lock-up my scooter for quite sometime (~ 2 yrs). At first, it worked really well. However, I then noticed rust building up inside the locking mechanism, which is supposed to be resistant to the elements. Unfortunately, last week I dropped the lock on the ground and the entire locking mechanism shattered. I was in utter shock. Apparently, the silver piece that is supposed to protect the lock, and the black outside sheath are plastic, which makes me question its ability to provide good security.I'm going to try a different lock combo, which I hope will be a little more durable."
1,Not This One,"The lock does what a lock is supposed to do, more or less. My wife uses her bike to commute in New York City, usually locking it to a traffic sign pole outdoors while at work. In the one year plus she has had it, the lock casing is falling apart. Rain and the usual drops and knocks of life have caused the round metal housing that surrounds the key slot to fall apart. The lock mechanism itself is no longer in great shape, and I fear it will stop functioning altogether when she inserts the key, leaving her bike locked somewhere unpleasant. Her previous lock was a Kryptonite U-lock, which she had for years until she lost all the keys. As good as the lock is, it doesn't work well without a key. The Kryptonite is more expensive than this, and given her experience, apparently worth it. The extra cable here is a nice extra, but I would prefer a better lock."
4,Keep your bike safe,"I bought this on the suggestion of a guy who worked in a bike store. This item was much cheaper on amazon, and still great quality. This is a great deal on a great and secure bike lock..."
2,Disappointing,"A rag-tag bunch of Messengers. Sub-par selection of tunes, minimally rehearsed. Blakey is in a bad mood (as the notes reveal) lamenting others' commercial success at his expense. In this remastered version, Hicks and Gilmore are mixed at such a low level that they are barely audible. Very poor engineering."
2,Book Review,"I have used that book with my ESL students at least 10 years ago. This book is easy to read, includes daily vocabulary that will surely come handy to these ones that want to learn English "" just for a purpose of communication."" IT includes comprehension questions and activities. All of my students enjoyed reading these stories because they caught their attention. Also, the students felt challenged and always ended up with writing predictions or extentions to those stories. I wish I could learn more about the author of the book!"
1,Big drop in quality,"Olympus had winner with the D-380. This D-390 is LOUSY. Pictures fuzzy, LCD screen in back is grainy and hard to read, and menu more confusing. I bought the D-390 hoping for pictures at least as good as the D-380, but they are much fuzzier, more pixellated, and the macro is a JOKE. Colors are also washed out compared to the D-380. I had to buy the D-560 to get decent photos. Olympus really blew it by discontinuing the D-380 and introducing the D-390. Don't pay more than $100 for the D-390. it isn't woth it."
5,Excellent choice for Amateurs,I have purchased this camera and I am very happy with the results. All I wanted to do was to take quick pictures for emailing to friends and family and this camera is excellent for this and absolutely a good bargain for the low price. Advantages for the first time digital photo user: 1) Affordable 2) Excellent pictures 3) User friendly featuresForget about the video mode; if you want to make a video film buy a video camera !
3,Also disappointed,"I just want to jump on the band wagon and say that this camera sucks up battery power much too quickly. I have bought so many different kinds of battery chargers thinking the problem was with the batteries I was buying. After a year now, I know the short life of this camera is due to the camera itself."
1,Horrible Digital Camera,This was a waste of money even if it was 10.00 it would be a waste! The camera drains the batteries within an hour or so! NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!
4,Unbeatable price and features when purchased in 2003,We still use it with no problems. So much has changed since then in digital cameras. But extremely reliable.
2,Not Impressed!,"This was my first digital camera and I am not impressed with it. It drains batteries within 1-2 hours of use, there is a large delay in everything and my camera dosen't ever turn on anymore. It does take beautiful pictures, though I have to admit. My advice is buy a Canon, Nikon or Kodak camera instead of any Olympus."
4,not that good,i have one of these but the bad thing is that the video is only 15 seconds long and doesn't have sound but in the oder hand it has a great zoom.
3,Batteries,"The batteries drain so fast. 1st I thought it was battery problem so I bought a new set, but within weeks i was haveing the same problem again and my father in law has different digital and they last so much loneger. I can put a pair of batteries in take 2 pictures and there dead by the next day and the camera also wreck the battery as they can't hold a charge.The 17 sec delay between each picture is so upsetting that why i getting a new carmera after 2 years. It was a waste of money"
2,life expectancy = ~ a year,"I bought this camera about a year and a half ago. For the first few months it was great, some pictures had some color/grainy issues, but the camera did it's job. After it hit the one year mark, i noticed a decrease in the quality of the photos it was taking. more and more were coming out looking overexposed or 'whited-out'. I just took a trip, and 5 out of 18 pictures came out viewable. Not sure how log these are supposed to last for, but this one is heading for the scrap heap."
3,its not newbie friendly - default settings unreasonable,"well, I have an older olympus camera and I love the way it works and takes pictures. I bought this camera for my mom and the most annoying thing about this camera is it DOES NOT store your settings. If I change it to 640x480 resolution, it won't stay after I turn it off and back on. It defaults to 1600x1200, which is nice and all but not for my very newbie mom who will never be able to change it to the lower resolution. I mainly bought it so she could simply take the pictures, plug it into her iMac, and email up pictures. With the default resolution settings, she would be sending us 1 MB of pictures with 2 pictures. Not being able to store my setting is annoying and unacceptable. All of my other cameras did it just fine. For this reason, I have to return this camera and find one that can store settings or default to a lower resolution."
2,not pleased,"I enjoyed very much the older version , the Olympus D-380. This camera (d-390) does not seem to produce the same beautiful colors that the older version produced. also the quality of the picture shown in the LCD was much sharper in the older version."
2,good while it lasted,"I was given this camera as a gift and loved it at first. Easy to use, took nice pictures. However, I agree with other reviewers--the batteries drain in days and the lag between shots was very long. Now (1 1/2 years later), even with brand new batteries, I cannot get the camera to stay on to take one picture."
4,Handy Camera,"You can use the USB port for Windows 98 or 98 SE to e-mail photos.Even if you are using AOL. Merely go to my album, right click on photos and place in My Documents or where ever you want your photos stored.STOCK UP ON BATTERIES! Or purchase a battery recharger.I know of several realtors that use this camera to photograph homes to list in the newspaper. This Olympus D-390 Digital Camera is a good starter camera."
3,you get what you pay for,"This was my first digital camera and for the two monthes or so, I really enjoyed it. It's really simple and easy to use. Taking pictures of people? Forget it. It washes out faces and makes you look like a ghost. It also eats batteries. A new set of batteries once lasted me 5 minutes... or about 8 pictures. That is PATHETIC. I would reccommend spending a little more money on a better camera. Or else buy lots of rechargables."
3,Warning! Battery Eater with Slow Shutter Speed!,"I recently went on vacation and used this camera (my Mother's) since mine was in the shop. I didn't have my rechargable batteries with me and boy did I pay - and pay and pay for new batteries over and over. (Four day trip!) Although the pictures turned out fairly good, the shutter speed was very disappointing to me. There was a good 2 or 3 seconds after pressing the button before the picture actually took. When you are trying to take a picture of someone snowboarding or skiing, in 2 - 3 seconds, that sucker is down the hill and you've got a nice picture of snow. I came home with too many pictures of snow!"
5,This is a terrific novel,These are characters that are either you or people with whom you'd want to befriend. I'd recommend it easily to anyone looking for a great story.
3,"Great sound, but the video? What video?","This show sounds awesome. Too bad I can't see what's going on. Cameras on floor or too far back and everything is covered in fog most of the time. Good quality of picture, bad camera operation and angles.A great show to enjoy on CD after converting.So, overall a C+."
1,A blind experience,"I don't typically write reviews for products, but I just couldn't hold myself back from commenting on this worthless piece of crap. I regret not reading the few reviews prior to my purchase which warned about the video quality. If you are hoping for close-ups of Yngwie's playing, you will be sorely disappointed since all you see is a silhouette washed out by many lights. There are some incredible solos in typical Mamsteen fashion; however Mark's voice is terrible. I absolutely loved him on Trilogy, but his high pitched screams throughout the show are revolting. Other's have said they would transfer the concert to mp3, but I'd have to find a way to remove the vocals in order to sit through the experience again. The only reason why I am forcing myself to kill a small part of my life is because I want to at least feel my few dollars didn't completely go to waste. I ordered Live in Brazil and the Budokan concert before watching this and only hope it won't turn out as crappy."
5,Very well written! A lot of insight!,"This was the first attempt to really study the history of Google. This book gave an excellent account of how Google evolved to how it is today. The author also shared some very interesting insights on how big things can really start with a wild, outrageous idea.Highly recommended!"
5,"fantastic!, high quality writing with great content","Was a very readable book, very engaging writing style and the content was interesting and well pitched, lots of ideas.As a marketer found this very interesting and thought provoking about the issues for the future of both business and humanity."
5,_not_ solely about the history of google,A very interesting read. I feared that this would solely be a story of the history of Google and was pleasantly surprised. John Battelle does a fantastic job at both summarizing the industry and adds his own thoughts on where the industry may be headed.
4,history of search,"tho a bit dated, i enjoyed this book, especially the first half about the early days and evolution of search. anyone interested in google specifically would be better off reading steven levy's ""in the plex"". but this book gives a nice detailed overview of the pre-google days, which i enjoyed."
4,Solid. Interesting.,"It's a quick read and a good study in ""searching."" I haven't read the new book on GOOGLE (Nov 05) but i hope people don't confuse these two books. Based on a quick skim of the Google book, this is the more important work."
2,Nothing new,It's a easy book to read through but it does not return any exciting news about search nor Google.John Battelle has some interesting visions. Unfortunately he is not able to explain any of his approaches in detail - not interesting for me.
2,Irrelevant story telling....,I did found some interesting pages..! However major part of the book (to me) is irrelevant story telling. Neither commercial nor technical nor informative.
5,Read this book,"I originally read this book from the library and was moved to buy it as a gift. While this book is a history of Google, it also gives a thought provoking discussion of how our brains work. The whole concept of ""search"" is presented so that anyone can understand how search engines (including our brains) operate and how this knowledge informs those who are writing these engines. It's a bit scary to realize that computer programs are tailoring every interaction we have with a computer in the hope that our experience will be what the programmer thinks is our desire. From the articles which appear on the home pages of places like MSN to the suggestions for other purchases on Amazon, someone is second guessing our every move. What ever happened to serendipity? All in all a fascinating read."
4,"""Search"" begins quest for more answers.","Well written, with insight gained from years of interviews, Search was an easy, entertaining read. Not only did it breakdown some of the timeline about Google's success, it gave insight into the inner workings of the Google and it's founders, as well as a view into the entire field of search. The book inspired a quest for a deeper knowledge of the web itself."
5,An insight into a company and an industry,As a computer professional I thought I pretty much got Search chalked out. It was quite a revelation to see that this book reveals facets about search that I did not comprehend before.Very exciting book and incidentally very good information about Google as a company as well.You can see my blog entry below as well if interested in my review: http://rajascyberspot.blogspot.com/2008/08/google-and-story-of-search.html
4,Great overview of the Search industry,"It's a great overiview of the search industry and its brief but intense history.However, it's also a good and refreshing reminder that success stories, such as Google's, are not envisioned or planned they way they later unfold. For example, the book explains how Google early on tried to sell their search engine to Yahoo! or one of the other portals, but no buyer was found! Google was in financial hardships and did not know how to make money (except with traditional banner ads) when Bill Gross came up with the pay-per-click model that Google simply copied."
5,"Great, detailed, account on the foundation of how search became what it is","This book provides a great review and account of the history on how the foundation of 'search' became what it is.From original information retrieval technology, to modern day search the reader is taken on a journey from dorm-room technology to startup company with all the situations and decisions that search pioneers faced, in the early days of search to what is now the status quo.As someone who has grown up with search, this is a great read of how search evolved and provides a great backbone for understanding the relationships of the various companies involved. This is a must read for those in the SEO/SEM industry."
4,Good Introduction to Search Engine Technology and Potential,"You probably use search engines to find information. If you already understand how one search engine varies from the next, this book will be much too simple and limited for you. Avoid the book.If, however, you choose which search engine based on how cool the url is for that engine, you should read this book. It will tell you a lot that can help you find better information . . . and what you may be able to look for in future search engine improvements. If that's your main reason for reading the book, you'll find it too long and involved for that purpose. There's an awful lot about the history of Google . . . which is essentially ancient history by now. I graded the book down from this perspective mainly because it takes Mr. Battelle a long time to get the simplest ideas across."
5,Exceeds its ambitious title!,"With clarity we learn that Search is a tool of intent, i.e., a basic activity of the brain. In the near future, we are likely to feel 'brain dead' without access to Search. This book will be my Holiday gift to family, friends and business associates."
4,Excellent Material On Search History & Google,"Extremely readable book. Good history of early seach companies like GoTo and their business models, in addition to Google"
3,Good but Over Promised,"This book is a history of ""search"" technology that uses the story of Google as the main rubric. John Battelle is an excellent writer. He clearly explains the elements of a search engine. He has some very important and intriguing ideas such as the database of intention and a search economy. His notion that he likes news sources that can make the most of deep linking also opens up new ways of thinking.However, he spends a lot of time on the business news part of the book, namely the Google IPO and things like that which were of only minor interest to me. I wanted more on the transformed culture and the new business rules and a more impressionistic history of Google. In that sense I think the book over promised."
5,Google Story : Eye Opener,This book has been an eye opener to me. Google's success speed and speed of achieving new milestones are inspiring. Author made sure to provide each and every small detail very well. Thank You for writting this excellent success story.-Niraj
2,Less Relevant Today,"So, maybe reading this book 5 years ago would have been very informative. By now, we all know Google well and also the story of how it came into being. I wanted more information on their advertising auction model, but it was mentioned in like one sentence."
1,Don't get the Kindle version,"5 stars for the content, 1 star for the Kindle version. I have long benefited from the hardback version of Dabney's Systematic Theology and highly recommend it, I can not recommend the Kindle version. The formatting is horrible, random different fonts sizes, HTML links in the text, no linked table of contents so the navigation is difficult, it is painful to use. Get the hardback version, it will enrich your understanding of the Christian religion but avoid the Kindle version."
1,The Height of Western Scholasticism,"Dr. R. L. Dabney's Systematic Theology represents the height of western scholastic theology, the logical conclusion of the theology of Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas. The arguments are remarkable, the logic is impeccable, and theology is hideous. Dabney was influenced by extreme reductionism and the essesental denial of any Mystical Attribute in our Pre-Eternal Creator. If one wants a complete, accurate, and unbiased Christian Theology uninfluenced by medieval Catholic theology, may I recommend An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith written by St. John Damascene in the Eighth Century, which is available freely online."
2,Do not read if anywhere near taking the bar!,"If you are a neurotic 3L fast approaching the bar like me, this is NOT a good choice for leisurely reading! Heck, if you are at any stage in law school, pre-bar experience, this is probably not a good choice. It will freak you out. Like crippling, must hide the book out of my sight NOW fear! There are detailed descriptions of how many hours a day he spent between BarBri and individual studying. There are detailed descriptions of the actual essay questions and how he approached them. We all know the bar will be tough and I found out that reading pages and pages of someone else's experience was not a healthy choice for my mental well-being. Maybe when I have passed the bar, I can pick this book up and chuckle about that rough patch in my life, but right now... I'm not mentally stable enough to handle that!"
3,Good to Skim,"I was a little disappointed in this book, after having to skim through a lot of filler to find the good parts. To put it bluntly, Wellen is a nice guy who goes to a pretty good school and eventually passes the bar, but he is not successful portraying himself as entertaining, funny, glamorous, or particularly remarkable. Luckily, however, Barman contains some good information. Wellen is clear and descriptive about how he got a job in a great law firm, what he did to study for the bar, and what it was like working at a law firm while he waited for his test results. Along the way, he also demonstrates a method of interpreting legalese. If you are a prospective law student, this is a good book to check out from the library or read at the bookstore."
5,Entertaining and Educational,"This DVD set is amazing. Eldon Taylor covers a great deal of information, from the workings of the human mind to manipulation techniques to achieving your spiritual goals - and he does this in a very entertaining manner. I enjoyed this set immensely and would love to hear him speak in person! The DVD set would be worth it at 10 times the price."
1,I couldn't get past the first dvd...,I couldn't get past the 1st dvd let alone 2 others. I was completely lost and bored. Was nothing like I thought it would be. Had to toss it. Money down the drain.
1,worse,"I thought that Battletech novels had hit an all time low with 'SWORD AND FIRE'. I was wrong. This represents the new achievment for poorly written Sci-Fi. If you stick this book Next to ANYTHING written by Michael Stackpole, you will kill your self laughing. Give us Stackpole, Charrette and Coleman."
4,Excellent and well paced,"The last Gressman book left some huge voids and chasms, only it seems for this one to fill. Everything negative in my review about #5 seems to have been addressed here. The story is involving, the combats are alive, and before you know it you're done the whole book. Can't wait for Prince of Havoc (last word December...)."
2,A nice try butt...,"A valiant effort but in the end it left me very unsatisfied. The problem with doing books based on Battletech is that sometimes the Mechs and the combat seem to overshadow the storyline. Don't get me wrong, there were some very good parts and the battles were written very well. But in the end it's just too much. There are so many battles in the book that for the most part the larger story is ignored.I've had mixed feelings about the whole Twilight series in general. I'm not sure I really agree having a series of books done by four different authors. You sometimes end up with different feels altogether. But be that as it may I have hope for the future and will eagerly await the release of ""Prince of Havoc""."
3,A book we could have done without,"Don't get me wrong, Gressman is a great B-Tech writer. But if the Twilight of the Clans had to be 8 books, they could have used this space to deal with more of the Inner Sphere during the campaign. The only reason I finished this book really fast was I got tired of hearing all the whining about how terrible war is and the toll it takes on the soldiers. It's their job, noone forced them into the military, so don't act like such a bunch of BABIES!"
3,Y Areina Winston have ta die?,"i didn't like it when areina winstron died. thought it was dumb. i mean, a 90 ton mech vs 70 tons? but with the clanners weapons and all, i can understand. but a cyclops vs a thor, cyclops havcing a gauss rifle? i dont think a ppc can be so accurate."
4,This book sent shivers down my spine...,"What makes this book different than the rest of the battle tech books? In this one, there were actualy feelings. The rest of the series is just the typical good guy versus bad guy shoot 'em up type thing. This book really makes you think about how horible war really is. Therefor I thought that this book was more realistic. It truly lived up to its name: Shadows of War."
4,clairol review,I think it is a very good productI recamend it to friendsI have been buying this product for a very long time
3,"OK, but not as good as before","As noted in other review, Clairol changed their formulas. Previously Color 32 Egyptian Plum gave me (a dark brown brunette) a very deep dark brown with dark plum highlights - I loved it! Now, the ""Burgundy Brown"" is the more correct color listing. (They need to remove the ""Egyptian Plum"" description from the box/labels since it no longer applies at all.)I like the deep auburn color the dye puts in my hair but when I want dark plum, I want _dark_plum_. So while the product does a pretty decent job, it's not providing the results that I'm looking for. Also, I used the 2 week Color Booster and found that it totally dampened the color :( Now instead of the bright auburn highlights showing through my dark hair, I simply have dark brown hair. I highly recommend ignoring the 2 week Color Booster pack entirely."
5,Glairol Natural Insticts Hair Color 28G Golden,Excellent product. I use it all the time. I would recommend to all those who like level 2 hair color.
2,Didn't work too well.,"I purchased Clove, medium ash brown, and used it to cover a small amount of gray. Now that I'm done, I can still see where the grays were, and it doesn't look a whole lot better. The process of using this product was messy, time consuming, and smelly. After going through all the trouble, the results were not worth it. I followed the directions precisely and left it in for 20 minutes (the maximum time). I won't be tempted to try this product again."
2,Misleading information.,"Product itself is fine. Delivery was fine also. The information states ""pack of 3"" giving the idea it's 1 kit x 3 boxes. It is really just 1 box with 3 items inside. By the time you pay the cost and shipping for 1 box you have twice the price you will find in stores."
2,Not good Covering gray,This didn't cover hardly any gray and I don't have a lot but they are all in front and this didn't cover them. So if you're looking for hair color to do that try something else. It did make my hair feel super nice after conditioner but no good for me.
3,The new version does not cover gray as well as the older version did,"Years ago, I used this product regularly, and was very happy with it, as it covered my grays well and seemed gentle on my hair. A week ago, I used this new version for the first time and was surprised that it didn't cover my grays well (especially around my temples). It's quite unfortunate, since I imagine that most people dye their hair in order to cover grays. I will give this product 3 stars, though, for being gentle on my hair and not drying it out. I was also happy with the color (Tweed) -- a nice, soft brown with not too much orange or red tones in it. I only hope the color fades to a tone I like as well."
3,New formula Natural Instincts,"I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts (Linen) for years, and was very happy with the product. I don't know if Clairol has discontinued that color, but I haven't been able to find it anywhere in my area, (Fresno, Ca.). Target, Rite-Aide, CVS, Walgreen's, Walmart, Von's Super Market, Save-Mart. They all have beauty products, but that color can't be found anywhere. I called Clairol and their customer service assured me that color was still available. In desperation I ordered 3 boxes from Amazon. The 3 boxes arrived in good time, and I proceeded to try the new formula. I was a bit disappointed at the directions and coverage. New directions said to apply to dry hair instead of wet. It seemed harder to get good coverage that way. I will go back to apply to wet hair. I hope it works ok that way. I think I liked the old formula better."
1,Why did you change a great product?,"To ClariolI love, love, love the old version of your medium brown color. Why on earth did you change the formula, with that stupid 2 week refresher that turns your hair reddish? On top of it, the newer formula dries out your hair and does not last as long. Please go back to the oringal formulas, please!!!!! I loved the older version, it beautifully colored my hair, and it made my hair silky smooth and healthy.GO Back to Orginal Version, or else this customer will leave you!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!!!,My mom used Natural Instinct for many years until they changed their formula. The worst part of it all was the 2 week color refresher! Turned my mom's hair into a fireball!!! IT'S PURE RED!!! (she used a dark brown hair coloring) She was very furious that she didn't leave the house for many weeks.I'm going to do a research for another ammonia free hair coloring. She won't be buying this brand again!
1,Does not wash out of your hair!,"This color is great if you don't like using harsh hair dyes, I'll give it that, but when it comes to washing out, it DOESN'T. Even when you're only doing the ""root touch ups"" like they suggest IT WON'T WASH OUT EVER. I have dark brown hair and my hair has been stained black. Since it's not like the ammonia hair dyes, it doesn't come out with Loreal color fix and bleach...well bleach is horrible, but it's what I'm going to try next to get this out of my hair, because I refuse to pay someone at a salon $300 to fix it. I know I may end up with no hair if I do that, so please don't lecture me. I just want to warn others that this does not wash out as promised, you're better off using a regular hair dye with stinky chemicals."
4,"To Gold For Naturally Dark Blonde, Good for Brunettes?","So I gave the Clairol Toasted Almond 4 out of 5 stars because I leave these Semi-Permanent dyes. They don't irritate my scalp as long as I don't wash my hair right before, they don't seem to damage my hair, the smell isn't bad at all, and there isn't an obvious line when it grows out.As for the color . . . I'm naturally dark blond so I wanted something to darken and deepen my color a bit so my hair color isn't so completely neutral. This color really means GOLDEN light brown. It's not to dark but with my already blond hair it made the color an unnaturally golden/coppery brown. It's not offal so I still ran around with it for a few days but it's not what I wanted either. For natural blonds I would recommend sticking with the other 2 light brown colors Tweed or Suede. If I were a natural brunette I WOULD give this a TRY if I wanted to ad some golden radiance to my color. I bet on a brunette this color would ad some beautiful depth and shine."
2,Washed Out,"I absolutely love the color however it washed out in a weeks time. I was so upset. I wrote them and they gave me a free coupon, but why would I use there product again for it to wash out another week later. I should have to just to my tried and true Feria"
4,Perfect color!,"I have a very pale complexion (""cool blue"") and this is the perfect hair color for me. I've tried other medium brown shades from Clairol, and this one is by far my favorite. It does make my hair a dark and cool brunette but it does not turn it *black* as I've heard others say. Use it if you have a ""cool"" complexion but don't if you have a ""warm"" one; there are better browns suited for warm skin tones. The color itself has faded a little bit after about three weeks, but that's about the amount of time it is advertised to stay so I can't really complain. Overall one of the favorite self-coloring brands."
2,Why change something that was wonderful!,"Why did you change your formula!! I loved your old formulat and have mixed two shades together for many years: 18rg and 28. This new formula doesn't mix well and my hair is like a teased mess after I shampoo! I have to use huge amounts of conditioner just in order to comb my hair after I shower. Please bring back the old formula - it was wonderful. Before , I had shiny, beautiful hair even with a perm and coloring - no more!"
1,The Worst Hair Color!,"I have colored my hair many times, and typically use Herbashine, but decided to give this a try because of the 2 week booster. I don't think I'm even going to use the booster because my hair is basically black using LIGHT golden brown, and it didn't cover my greys at all. The only reason this stuff gets 1 star is because the conditioner is nice, but they don't give you enough (I had to use the whole bottle for my hair, and it says use 1/3) I have long hair and one box of Herbashine is plenty to do all of my hair, I could have used a second bottle because this did not cover all of it thoroughly. Needless to say I'll be switching back in hopefully less than 28 shampoos."
3,wish I had the old formula,I love the color and wish I could find it in stores but the color doesn't last as long as it once did. I wish Clairol would stop trying to fix what isn't broken. I use the blonde but it ends up turning red in just a couple of weeks. I would love to have the neutral blonde color back it did much better and lasted much longer. The 2 week touch up is useless and there isn't enough of it in a pack to do much good.
1,BEWARE!,"This is NOT the same product as it used to be. Now, turns hair dry and frizzy. Color is awful and does not last (thank God!). So sad; it was a good product before formula change."
1,Color refresher is YELLOW,"I use this product for my roots/growout every 2 mo or so. The color it self seems similar to what it has been to me but I just did the ""color refresher packet"" which upon opening it was bright yellow. That should have stopped me right there....I used it anyways & my blond hi lights are now CANARY YELLOW! I have to use lemon juice or baking soda or something to get this awful yellow out!!!! It looks terribly cheap! DONT use the color refresher!!!!!"
1,Lost a customer,"I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts Midnight Black for a long time. I loved the original formula. The color was excellent and the conditioner was the best (wish I could have bought it separate it was so good). I bought the new 10 min formula to cover my gray with Black and my roots are brown! It is too ugly. I now have Brown roots and the rest of my hair is black. I don't like it at all. I don't understand why the formula changed. Why won't Clairol tell us the reason? Was the original formula hazardous to our health? If so, does this mean the new formula is even worse? The 10 min formula is deceptive. It does not color my hair to color I expect. I will not use this formula ever again. As a matter of fact I think I may be afraid to use even the original formula if I ever find it again. So long Clairol and thanks for nothing."
5,I'm glad Amazon had it!,"I've been using that hair color (Clairol Natural Instincts Golden Honey) for a while, but couldn't find it ANYWHERE - I had searched about 15 stores in 2 states! When I finally called Clairol directly, they found it for me on Amazon. I never would have thought to look for hair color here. SO - now I know where to look for those hard-to-find items!"
3,The old version was better,"Why do products have to change and ""improve""? Here's what I don't like: The color part is okay, the 2 week enhancer part is TERRIBLE. You wash it in, wait 5 minutes, rinse. It turned my hair and scalp orange (I used Nutmeg #28), it didn't cover the gray roots or where my hair had bleached out from the sun AT ALL. It was like I poured an orange popsicle on my head. And the smell was really strong, not in a good way. The next morning I washed my hair and the shampoo turned orange, the whole thing washed away (YAY). I will be throwing away the 2 week touch-up pack."
1,Color refresh ruins the product,I am not willing to pay the extra money for the product's change to include the color fresh packet. As mentioned by many others it turns your hair and scalp orange!! I don't know why Clairol changed a previously well liked product. It also now contains peroxide.
2,Too much work AND,"I found that having to put the color boost in a week or 2 weeks after dying my hair was annoying. I also found the instructions for the color boost to be confusing, since I had no idea what it was or how it worked. It didn't seem to be any better than any other coloring I had used before, and, maybe, not as good. Lastly, it LEFT STAINS ON MY PILLOWCASE! There is now a section of my pillowcase that is stained with a brownish (Lighter than the color in my hair, thank God) area where my head had rested during sleep (and, yes, I rinsed it VERY well). I have NEVER had a hair color leave color on my pillowcase before. I was shocked to see it, and VERY annoyed. I HAD a subscription for regular deliveries of this product, but I cancelled it. I won't use it again."
2,New Formula is Lacking!!,"I agree with those who say the new formula is horrible. I have been using this color Cinnaberry for at least 15 years. It was my go to color if I was feeling like a change. The most recent application left my hair clown red and horribly dry. Dont even touch the refresher packet becasue that is a joke. It totally changes the color and makes it even more orange! It used to last me a few weeks before fading. It lasted a week and started to fade. I dont know why they have to change formulas. If it isnt broke Clairol, dont fix it. I did my research and found a color that is exactly like the old Cinnaberry. Garnier Herba shine 565 Med Auburn Brown. It looks like the old color is supposed to and is shiny and ammonia free!"
1,"Please, Clairol, Bring Back the Old Formula","I have used Natural Instincts Linen for many years and have always loved how natural it looked. Not any more! The new formula doesn't cover as well and has an unnatural look. And the special solution you put on after two weeks makes it worse!! For the first time ever, my friends asked me what I did to my hair. If I can't find the old solution somewhere, I'll be forced to look at products from other companies. Please, Clairol, bring back the old formula!!"
5,the roaring twenties,This dvd was very fun and enjoyable to watch and is in excellent condition with no scratches at all. I was also impressed by the fact that it arrived within just a few days of submitting my order. This seller is obviously a professional who cares about his/her customer service and I'd highly recommend this seller in the future.
5,Husband loves it!,My husband has always been a big James Cagney fan. We started a collection for him for Christmas. Cannot find these movies in stores. Picture is crisp and clear for a very old movie. Thrilled with purchase. Have bought many more on Amazon so far. thanks!
5,"Waiting for this in DVD, then for the price to get reasonable.","Always loved this movie. Finally the powers that decide this put it out on DVD. However, the price was way out of line. This is not a shootem up gangster flick, even though there is some of that. It doeshave a romantic subplot and a glimpse into life in 20's."
5,One of the best gangster films ever made,"Humphrey Bogart & James Cagney give sterling performances as rival gangsters in this great film. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore; and if you decide to add this to your collection of classic films, be sure to get it in the original black & white version-it is a real ""crime"" to colorize all the wonderful old classics! END"
4,The Roaring Twenties,"This movie is from 1939, Hollywood's Greatest Year. It is considered one of the best from that year but I would rate it good but not on the same level as Wuthering Heights, Gone With The Wind, The Wizard of Oz and others. The story is a bit too slick and the characters not real enough. The intent of the filmmakers was not to make the film realistic, it is told as a ""memory"" but it doesn't affect me as much as more ""realistic"" gangster films. Cagney and Bogart are wonderful and a lot of fun to watch, the leading ladies lack something in their roles and presentation. The wonderful lines in the films have become classics such as ""He used to be a Big Shot."" The extras are very good and the commentary is interesting. Recommended and you definitely have to see it if you are a fan of 1939 and classic film."
3,Vintage Cagney,"This movie is a typical Cagney flick. His gait, mannerism's remained with him throughout his career. Jimmy is one of the best ever to appear in the movies."
1,Table of contents,"How can I buy this book online, when you don't display the table of contents? If I don't see that button, please correct me. Thank you!"
3,Smallish,"It's on the small side and I'm not crazy about the shape. It may hold 1 official serving of cereal, but I'd prefer something bigger. I feel the rice bowls, which ironically seem too big for rice, are a better option for cereal. That said, it is a decent piece of porcelain and is Made in Germany."
5,My son passed the Technician exam with ease!,I used this book to help my son pass the Technician exam and he passed with ease. Mr. West's approach makes learning some of the difficult concepts of Technician theory simple. My son passed his exam today with flying colors and he is only 12 years old!
2,Good customer service,Gun I ordered didn't work. Emailed jacks and they refunded my money the next day. I messed with the gun and it turned out the plunger on the tube wasn't working. Bought a 15$ one at harbor freight and out the tube on the. Neiko and now it's working just fine.
2,Weak,"It will not pump the types of grease I have purchased. The zerk fitting was hard to insert, and tore the zerk out of my pump when I tried to remove it. May be able to adjust the zerk fitting pressure. Wish I had bought a better pump. Waste of money. Hope to find some grease I can heat up and pump thru it."
4,A VERY ENTERTAINING READ,"FISH STICKS IS ABOUT THE RECENT FALL BUT RISE AND FALL AGAIN HISTORY OF THE NY ISLANDERS. IT IS PRETTY ENTERTAINING AND ENLIGHTENING. A BULK OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS, OPINIONS, AND LANGUAGE USED BY SUPER EGO MIKE MILBURY. (PLEASE SOMEONE MUZZLE THIS IDIOT)I RECOMMEND THIS MOSTLY FOR ALL ISLANDER FANS AND FOR SOME DIEHARD HOCKEY FANS. WORTH THE READ."
3,Pity- I liked the fisherman logo,"As one of the few who thought the fisherman logo was cool (and I'm not even an Islanders fan), I was hoping this would give me some info on that, but it barely gives any. Is anyone willing to sell a jersey with the fisherman logo? I'd love to have one of those. Good review of the Isles."
4,A must have,This is another toy from the star wars collection that you must get. I have seen many star wars items come and go so i am going out and getting it. I already have stormtrooper and another one. so hurry before they are gone. Just like transformers reissue collection they come and go. I wont miss any more collections
5,Cool product.,"i used this product last weekend, and thought it worked well. steve and i were able to compare our jump time to each other--though i wish we didnt have to share the air pod. meant loaning it to him after every run. a lot of people on the mountain liked it and had never seen anything like it."
5,First time Ann Rule reader,"My first adventure into reading true crime, certainly not my last. It seemed as though Ann must have been an eyewitness to Harvey Carnigan's life of crime. It was very well told, easy to follow, difficult to put down. Eight more Ann Rule books sitting on the shelf for me to read - and more to come."
4,I love Ann Rule books,"I'm a big fan of Ann Rule, so I have read a lot of her books and stories. Although the Want-Ad Killer was good, I like some of her books better. I still would recommend the book if you like her work.She did a good job illustrating this slimy, sleaze-ball, nut job, sicko from hell. No other way to describe him!"
4,Classic barbershop disinfectant,"This is a great product, which will sanitise any shaving implement against bacteria, fungi, viruses and almost any other patogen that could be found on a razor. Since vintage razor collecting is becoming more popular, Barbicide should also, since it is more effective and easier on a vintage razor than boiling ot diluted bleach. Highly recommended."
5,Barbicide is #1 next to Scrubbing Bubbles!,I bought this when I started buying used safety razors. Mine came from Sally Beauty. I've used it on 34 razors (double edge and single edge and injectors as well!) in the past few months. Works really well. I also use Scrubbing Bubbles for further disinfecting. I just discovered while cleaning up a 99 cent Schick Krona I got off eBay that had some rust from an old blade being in it for decades that if you use a toothpick while the Barbicide is still wet on the razor it will take off light rust! Keep dunking your razor to keep it wet and it works really well. Coke or really acidy soda also removes rust but is sticky. I'll continue to buy this product in the future. My batch right now is still good and has not gotten cloudy and it's been 3-4 months since I made it. Great product! Get a screw top glass jar to keep your solution in so you don't have to keep making it and keep it under your bathroom sink.
4,A cool workout cd,"Great for your workout, had it before but stolen out of my car,purchased it again because its an excellent club mix, was hard to find until I found it here on Amazon,indicating no longer available and/or for what it is,best of club hits!"
1,4 use wonder....,"I bought this product exactly 6 weeks ago. 6 WEEKS ago.... I was thrilled with its little red light that told me when my rug was dirty and when it had successfully vacuumed all the dirt up by sporting a small GREEN light... the first 3 uses I was completely sold... Then. During room 3 on the 4th use... it caught fire... not the room, the BISSELL... I removed the plug from the wall and watched with amazement as my 4 ... well, nearly 4 use wonder died... yes, I did try and plug it back in- I'm a dreamer I admit... more smoke. I was convinced..I bet this in not the product line that holds up bowling balls...Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this product!"
1,Worked Once Great! Second time....poof....,"I was so excited to get this vacuum (did I just write that?) and have it work tremendously the first time! I love the dirt indicator light that turns green when it's clean. It sucked up everything and did a great job. I went to use it the second time and half way through vacuuming....POOF! It stopped spinning, smelled like something was burning, it was very hot. I just ordered another one and hopefully my second try will work. I through out the box so have to wait until the second one arrives to send the first one back."
1,Impossible to purchase extra upper tank filters,"I have owned this vacuum for over a year and have had frequent problems with it, within 2 months the plastic release pedal which drops the vacuum from upright to vacuum mode broke, this took about 2 months and 2 different Bissell repair shops to get repaired. I have tried repeatedly to purchase extra filters for the upper tank since it clogs up so quickly and was told today that they are unavailable and to try making my own using foam! The vacuum is out of commission as long as this filter is drying and if you use heat to dry it faster it will fuse the filtering components and become ineffective, the belt just broke on my vacuum and it is difficult to remove the bottom of the vacuum to replace it once you manage to find one to purchase. This vacuum seems to be out of service and unavailable to me to clean my home at least 50% of the time! Really unhappy with this product."
2,Not great,"Well I have had this vaccum for just over a month and it has died on me. I was using it and the brush on the inside stopped spinning (the clear front allows you to see the brush moving while it is vaccuming, to see the dirt I suppose) and an awful burning rubber smelled came from it. I checked all over for clogs or something wrapped around the inside but found nothing. Also it is very loud compared to my old vaccum. Until now the noise was my only complaint. I need to get another one and it won't be a bissell."
2,Bissell okay for a house with only one or two people,"But it is not okay for a house with 4 kids, 2 dogs, and a cat. The sensor light (green/red switch) is hard to get off... you have to clean this filter, than that filter, than you have to take another vaccum and clean the hoses... and then the light switch is still not completely green! Too much hasle... did I mention that this was after only 2 uses!!! Needless to say, I returned mine to Walmart and am now off to find another vacuum."
3,Arrived broken,"I was very excited to get started with this vacuum. After 5 minutes of awesome vacuuming, the hepa filter on the side came flying out. Thinking I did something wrong I put it back in, long story short, the door latches are broken. The nice woman at Bissell is sending a new one BUT not a good start. I taped it shut and vacuumed the rest of the house. It really does a great job but I'm not sure I can get past it arriving broken. Hopefully, it 7 - 10 days when I get the new door, I'll be happy with this product."
2,Threw it away - a filthy dirt puking monster,"It works OK for a while then it turns into a dirt puking monster. Every other use requires major sugery to remove clogs. It's guts are only a little less complex than the human intestine. A good choice to send to college if your kid's an engineering student. NOT for people with allegies because you'll get coated with dust emptying it, unclogging it, and when it clogs it blows dirt everywhere."
2,clumsy vacume,"I am 35 with 1 child a husband(AKA 2nd child),and 2 cats. I run the vacume everyday, and in all Fairness to bissell I do not have much patents. However in the short time i have had this i have come to realize i dont need a little light to tell me my carpet is clean. The cord altho it has great leangth always gets tangled in the hose. If you decide to use the hose get ready for a wrestling match because its so hard to pull out and put back, and I cant tell you how many times the hose have fallen off during vacuming due to the fact that the slot thats suposed to hold it up on the vacume is not tight enough and their is no way short of duct tape to tighten it. Being that i run the vacume everyday i have bought one about every year for the past 10 yrs, I was sold on the neat little attachment that has its own spin brush. All said,this is not a user friendly vacume."
5,Absolutely Great!!!,"After shopping around and looking at a lot of vacuum cleaners, I came home and looked here on Amazon to see what was offered. Was I ever surprised when I saw this vacuum offered for the price and then I got to take another 25.00 off and I got a 3 way FeatherWeight vacuum as well. My vacuum was delivered to my door and I put it together without difficulty and then set about to vacuum. Oh my!!What a job. I have hardwood floors, tile and carpet and it went from one to the other without any problems picking up everything that it was supposed to pick up. It is so easy to use and it does a simply WONDERFUL job!!! Never again will I ever use a ""bag"" vacuum!!! Way to go AMAZON.COM for this great offer!"
4,Great!,This is the first time I have taken the time to review anything. I love this vacuum. I had Oreck vacuum for years. I loved the Oreck's but this is just as good if not better.
4,Good bagless vacuum cleaner.,"Bought this vacuum 3 months back for $79.99 and it is working good. Don't know why Amazon increased $50.Since there are so many models like 3593, 35933, 3596 not sure which one is best."
1,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time with this if you have a pet. This vacuum worked well...until we got a dog. Now, it barely picks up anything and leaves stuff all over the floor. The clogs are very difficult to clean since taking this thing apart is not exactly easy."
3,great on carpet; poor on hardwood,"I should start by saying that my last (and only) vacuum before this was a canister. Maybe I shouldn't expect this to perform as well on hard floor, I don't know. This cleaned the carpet really well and--like the other reviewers said--pulled up a shocking amount of crud and dust. The hardwood was another matter, though. It seemed to do an almost adequate job on small crummy stuff, but would not pick up anything rice krispy size ir bigger. As a mother of 4 small kids, I need a vacuum that will pick cereal bits and other food crumbs.This also performed better on the tile and vinyl floors that on the hardwood. I would not recommend this if your house (like mine) is mostly hardwood. If you have wall-to-wall carpet in most of the house, though, this would be a good choice."
5,This works very well,"It is easy to use and vacuums very well. It does break belts so buy a few extra, they are easy to change."
4,This vacuum really sucks... it's a good thing,"This vacuum really showed me how dirty my carpet was. My boyfriend used it the first time and soooo much crud came out. Unfortunately he forgot to pay attention to the dirty can and overfilled it accidentally just by doing a regular vacuum.The suction power on this vacuum is great, the dirt canister fills up nicely and is easy to clean when you watch it reach the fill line. Plus the sensor that indicates when the area is generally clean is a great boon.Only 4 stars because it can create a bit of a mess when you're emptying the dirt canister, especially if you overfill it."
1,Vacumn is a pain in the neck,I bought this vacumn because I have dogs and I read that it sucks very well and for simpicity of use.It features a zero on this front.Its noisy and the filter blocks up after one use so you have to clean out the whole system and replacing the filters is more expensive than having bagged vacumn. Its heavy and cumbersome and does not last long belt wise. I have to replace the belt every two months or so.All in all not a very low maintenance vacumn. if you just have light vacumning and not dogs that require daily vacumning of the house then its ok. But one could do better i think.I would not purchase one like this again
5,Bissell stands behind the product!!!!!!!,"Bought my Bissell back in spring and it met a very scary death in November. However, once I called up Bissell, they sent a BRAND NEW one (actually a better & newer model) without any questions asked!!!! They even paid for FedEx to my door.The vacuum is great, but the customer service and belief in their products is outstanding!!! I will never switch companies now. They stand behind the product! Buy this Bissell."
4,almost satisfied.,"2 minor issues on this vacuum.1. With carpet cleaning, due to belt location on rotating brush, there is uncleand area on the carpet. Like:##+###############+###############+###############+###############+#############Of course, you can shift vacuum path and clean all the surface,but I wish belt location was on the edge of the rotating drum.2. The angle between vacuum itself and floor should be smaller. I mean the angle can be changed from 90degree to 30degree, but I wish it went to 10degree so that the vacuum go under children bed or low table easily.I'm still satisfied with bagless, dust indicater, HEPA feature."
2,it WAS good....,"I have needed a new vacuume for some time and I did my research and bought this one brand new. It was great for about 7 uses....then the sensor light (red dirty green clean) stopped working, it lost suction and it smelled like it was burning up!!!! I checked the beater bar to make sure nothing was stuck or wound...nothing was...I checked the hose for suction, no suction. No matter how appealing it looks....just buy something with better ratings please!"
5,Best vacuum ever!!!!,"I purchased this vacuum a few weeks ago and I LOVE IT!!!! I am amazed and shocked at what it picks up, we have a cat and a dog, so our house is very furry, this vacuum picks it up and makes our carpet look better than ever!!!"
5,Fantastic vacuum for pet owners!,"I've had Dirt Devils and Hoovers, and none come close to what this Bissell does! I never realized just how much dirt and animal fur was being left behind until I vacuumed with this baby. My carpets look near-new, something I thought I'd never see again. Thanks to all here who recommended it! I researched many models, and this one had some of the best reviews. It is amazing to think that I only paid $105 for this great machine!"
1,Not so good,"EXTREMELY LOUD, doesn't suck all the dirt up, quite heavy and has a burning smell every time we use it. I would NOT recommend this product."
5,Two years and still going...,"I love this vaccum. The suction remains and it really does a good job. One of my problems was I would run out of vacuum bags and wait until they arrived, or I went out to buy more. This vacuum is excellent for rugs."
2,A horrible waste of my money.,"I purchased this vacuum back in January and was at first quite impressed with its cleaning abilities. It picks up dirt and hair very well. My carpet looked much improved after vacuuming for the first time with the Bissell. Two to three months after purchase, the brush rolls began to sieze up and stop spinning on a regular basis, causing them to break. I became diligent about cleaning the hairs off of the brush roll after each use, which is very inconvenient but I wanted to make the vacuum last. Even so, the brush rolls continue to break. I have gone through four rolls in a seven month period. I have spent on brush rolls nearly what I spent on the vacuum purchase itself.A woman at the local vacuum store told me that Bissells don't handle long hair well. I wish I had known! So, long story short: Yes, this vacuum picks up wonderfully, but if anyone in your home has shoulder length hair or longer, or pets, don't waste your money."
2,Vac which refuse to Suck !,"I have been using this vacuum cleaner for about a year now and I feel it is not a good one (even though I like the bagless feaure, light in weight and an OK price) here is why:(1) The suction is WEAK, many reviewers think the opposite and I believe they were mislead by the effect of the powerful brush! The brush scrapped materials from the surface of the carpet and gives false impression that lots of dirt is collected.(2) It picks up dog hair and dust ok, but not even a small object on the floor (especially bear floor without carpet).(3) The brush keeps rolling at high speed even when the vacuum is in up-right position. I think this is really a poor design.(4) Very noisy, it is louder than the one I had before (which was truly a powerful one).If you are looking for serious vac, I do not recommend this one."
5,Very Nice.,Beautiful etching and clear base. A little heavy because of the solid base. Once accustomed to the weight it is very nice.
3,Good!,Her accent and voice is very soft sometimes its hard to understand until you've listen to it a few times but I think its still a good workout. I've always worked out regularly so I do her advanced exercises.
1,Don't buy this!,"She goes way too fast on this DVD. Not only does it make it difficult to follow her, but you don't get to enjoy the poses or the stretches. It's difficult to understand her directions--so you have to watch her rather than listen. You can't do the poses and watch her at the same time, making this DVD completely worthless."
3,More active than Shiva Rea's yoga workout,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a prenatal yoga workout that was more challenging that the Shiva Rea prenatal yoga workout, which felt too gentle. I also bought it because I love ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1"" by Sarah's sister Karyne.It's not bad. It certainly is more active than Shiva Rea's, as I hoped. But I tend to compare both the yoga DVDs to classes I've taken in the past that were led by good instructors, and I just don't feel as stretched out and relaxed with these DVDs as I did with the yoga classes. But the instruction is pretty good and I would probably buy it again anyway.On the other hand, I would highly recommend the Vol. 1 workout. I owe the shape I'm in and my energy level to that DVD. I even regained definition in my arms and legs that I had lost."
2,I expected more,"I bought this workout because of the great reviews for Vol. 1, but I was very disappointed. The actual workout is only 17 minutes long. The yoga poses are rushed. There is no time to breath into the stretches. There are many modified poses so that you can choose your level. It is amazing what this woman can do with her pregnant body. There are some unique poses that I haven't seen in other pregnancy yoga workouts. But, I was disappointed with this purchase. I do not want to have to pause every pose so that I can get a good stretch, and at least 30 minutes of a workout. I don't recommend this yoga workout to anyone. Save you money."
3,Best for later in your term,"You'll get a decent workout, but I would recommend something else for the first half of your pregnancy. This wasn't my favorite workout or video while I was pregnant, but it was a nice deviation from walking. Personally, if I had to do it again, I'd do regular yoga for the first half of pregnancy, then add this in towards the end when it's harder to move, but of course, I'm no doctor."
3,Not as good as Vol 1.,"I purchased this item because I love the Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Volume 1. It's my favorite video. However, this video is lacking. It has no warm-up or cool-down. It's very difficult to follow her instruction because there is hardly any instruction. I've been doing yoga for 10 years so I don't need a ton of instruction, but I found myself having to repeatedly stop to figure out what she wanted me to do. The workout feels disjointed and awkward. Stick to the Perfect Pregnancy, Volume 1. I gave it a three because it is somewhat challenging, which can be hard to find in a prenatal video, so I will probably do it again."
3,it's ok,"Wife used this for both her pregnancies so far... late on (circa 7-8 months) she was still doing the advanced and getting bored. If you do yoga when you are not pregnant, this might not be the best alternative, if you struggle with yoga a few months into your pregnancy then this might be for you"
4,Great for all levels,"These work out videos are great, I have vol 1 and 2. There are not a lot of extra features, but the workout is not boring and 70 minutes seems to fly by. You might need to use the pause button a bit, as they both tend to move on to the next thing fairly quickly, and I have trouble keeping up. It is definitely a workout, you will feel it, even if you follow the beginner level."
5,"The ""Super"" Perfect Workout","I am often looking for a quick, but meaningful yoga workout to get myself going in the morning- and I was really thrilled with ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 2"" As someone who works out at least five days a week, I was worried that a pregnancy workout dvd might not give me enough, but I found it such a plus that this workout has both beginner and advanced levels clearly demonstrated! It had a really nice flow, the poses, movement, and stretching kept my interest and got my blood flowing. I think it would be suited for most at any stage of pregnancy, or even if you are not currently pregnant!"
2,Surprised how much I didn't like it,"I loved the Vol. 1 DVD, so I thought that I would love this one as well. Not at all! This DVD moved WAY too quickly, and it didn't feel like yoga at all. I honestly put it on for less than 5 minutes before I said ""forget it,"" and stopped. I'm in good shape, I generally like workout DVDs and have no problem following along, even when they move quickly, but this one wasn't even enjoyable. Stick with volume 1!!"
2,Stick w/ vol 1. Sara is not a yoga instructor and she goes way too fast,"I did this video maybe five times. The things I liked were the plank work for core. The set is really nice and relaxing. However even though in another part of the video menu, she goes over the yoga sequence she will be following, Sara just rushes through these sequences leaving no time to stretch the muscles. The benefit of yoga is to lengthen the muscles by holding some poses. She does these salutations really quickly. I did this with nonpregnant friends and they weren't feeling it. She just rushes too quickly through it. One particular section she does this weird downward dog to back bend thing and where you lift a leg and arm. It just doesn't feel very stable or safe and she doesn't give you time to do the exercise safely. The video overall isn't bad but I found myself tending to do other videos."
2,The Perfect Pregnancy Workout,"This DVD had good reviews, I wanted something that would stretch and relax and do some work too, however, I found this video to be very difficult to follow and I've practiced Yoga for years. I am just beginning my second trimester with my first child. I feel that the instructor moves way to quickly between positions, and it's constantly bouncing back and forth between modifications. I couldn't keep up and was very disappointed. The moves and poses look wonderful, but she doesn't give you the chance to move thru them and keep up. I found Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rae to be wonderful!"
4,"A rare gem, featuring two of the finest actors of the 1900's","For anyone who likes a good musical, this movie is a must see! In addition, if you, like me, are a big fan of the light-on-his-feet, gregarious Gene Kelly, and the bubbly, ever-energetic Judy Garland, this film turns out to be much more than that... It is a rare gem, featuring outstanding chemistry between two of the most engaging of MGM's ""golden-age"" screen personalities. The dance numbers between the two are fantastic, pure vintage Hollywood, and the chemistry between the two characters (both down-and-out vaudeville actors) as their relationship warms from hate, to like, to attraction, to love, is superb. I can only say that it is a pity that these two fine actors didn't make any more pictures together."
5,FOR ME AND MY GAL,This was Gene Kelly's first movie. And Judy Garland looks good and of course sings good. The title song is a favorite of mine too. It's not in color but the nostalgia of that film is enjoyable to watch. I'm glad that it's finally on DVD.
4,Obviously I'm a Gene Kelly fan.,"Quality of the product was very good. The case and DVD are both very acceptable.I bought 2 of this DVD and had one shipped to my Grandmother after she had told me it was her favorite Gene Kelly movie. My favorite is still Singin In the Rain. I thought the movie was still very good, and Judy Garland is a great actress as well. Definitely worth the money.Hope this helps."
1,big Gene and Judy fans -- but this is awful,"My kids (7 & 9) and I really enjoy old musicals. Sadly, this one did NOT stand the test of time. It was a good ""teaching moment"" for discussing World War II propaganda, but otherwise had no redeemable value. Aside from the first twenty minutes or so, the rest is unwatchable. Please check out the sweet title tune on youtube, but don't waste your time or money watching the rest. It is truly awful.Summer Stock and the Pirate, both with Gene and Judy, are much much better than this!!!"
1,One Word - Depressing!!!!!!!!,"This movie I think was just plain depressing! Just when you think something good and happy will happen, someone dies, people seperate, bones are broken, so on and so forth. This movie got alot of great reviews, and it was a fun movie, but for people who like complete happy endings, this film is not for you."
4,Really good movie,"I had some reservations about purchasing this movie because I had read about the ""hokey"" Gene kelly draft dodging and such, but I was plesantly surprised! I expected to see him shooting from foxholes with a big goofy grin! It really was a very good movie. And there were actually extras! I highly reccomend this movie."
3,for Judy fans only,"I love Judy Garland, but this film really doesn't hold up well. Judy's performance is typically brilliant, but plot is leaden and often less than believable."
5,I reall enjoyed the story!,"THANK you for this movie. It was fun to watch. It was about integrety, honor and respect. It made me cry. Thank you for making this movie available for me."
3,Not bad.,"There is no doubting that this book contains an awful lot of information. However, I did find it rather difficult to follow and contained lots and lots of text without many diagrams which would have made the concepts easier to understand.It appeared hard work to wade through so many pages of solid text but overall contained some useful ideas."
4,Great vintage performances,"Old-school guys like me who lived the 60's and 70's are a bit frustrated (to say the least) not to be able to see most of the acts they enjoyed back in the days. SO when I saw that DVD I knew I was going to buy it no matter what. And I am glad I did! 12 great tracks and vintage performances drawn from TV appearances from (probably) all over the world as you can even see during the Joe Bataan performance the RAI (Italian TV) logo at the bottom! All the performances are playback, but the remastered audio tracks are great, although the image color has sometimes faded a little bit. Enjoy Aurra, Instant Funk, Skyy (First Time Around is brilliant), Loleatta Holloway, First Choice, Bunny Sigler or Love Comittee and do the time-warp!!!!"
4,IN THE BEGINNING:,"Okay. What we have here is a concert with 5 original Whispers, Lakeside before Fantastic Voyage, the original Shalamar and I can't for the life of me think of the final group. But one of the 5 Stairsteps is prominent with this group. Great concert. Only snag is during Shalamar's part of the show. There are no closeups. Had there been at least a couple of closeups on Shalamar, this would be a 5 star review."
1,"Big let down, after the hype of hope for justice.","I am let down by the mystical poetry and non revealing innuendo that fail to inform the reader. I felt like the author has trivialized such a serious subject. The riddle filled poetry only hints at suspicions, implying that the author herself is only grasping at straws for many facts. If someone wants to know about Anna Mae they will be let down by reading ""Who would unbraid her hair.... The only good thing I find about this book is that it does get Anna Mae's name out and about and on people's minds.The book is not a who done it."
4,A Lovely Story,"I was really excited about reading this book because the premise sounded so promising! A bunch of elements that really intrigued me, especially a lost garden and the setting being the war era, which holds a strange fascination for me.This is a beautiful and well-written novel. The prose is flowery but flows well; the author is indeed a gifted writer. There were some parts of the story line for which I just didn't care, but overall I enjoyed it.One thing I liked most about this novel was the detailed descriptions of the suffering of London during the bombings. As Americans I think we are rather ignorant of how much the people of our mother land suffered, and this was definitely eye-opening. I appreciated the perspective.It's short and a quick read. I recommend it."
3,"Beautiful language, but leaves you wanting","This is a quick read and is full of beautiful language and imagery. The characters are interesting and the discovery of the garden keeps the reader engaged. The intersection of real books is an interesting technique, gardeners and readers of Woolf won't be disappointed. The end comes rather suddenly, and leaves you wanting more. The garden's function in the end and the narrator's relationship to it is rather disappointing"
4,Gardens and Life,"This is the story of a shy horticulturist in England during W.W. II, who leaves her labortory to direct a team of Land Girls, who grow vegetables for the war effort. Her personal growth is perceived and entwined with her relationship with garden plants. A pleasure to read for anyone who loves plants. Suzanne Love Harris"
3,Strangely wonderful,"This is a nice quick read, but it isn't pointless. The book opened my eyes to a lot of things that, even though the book takes place in the 1940s, still pretain to now. The end was sad, but it left me content in a akward way. I would say that if you have the time read the book because it is very well written, with a good story to back it."
2,not my style,"I'm not sure why this book appeals to so many people. It's clear from the beginning that the author is working really hard to be lyrical & passionate, & is in love with her own writing. It makes it impossible to enjoy the story, because the author's desperate effort is so obvious. Near the end she confirmed my suspicions when she writes, ""When a writer writes, it's as if she holds the sides of her chest apart, exposes her beating heart. And even though everything wants to heal, to close over and protect the heart, the writer must keep it bare, exposed. And in doing this, all of life is kept back, all the petty demands of the day-to-day. The heart is a river. The act of writing is the moving water that holds the banks apart, keeps the muscle of words flexing so that the reader can be carried along by this movement"".Blech."
3,average candy,i would say this candy is a good choice if you are a cinnamon and hot&spicy lover. on the other side is't just a jelly candy with cinnamon glaze so after a while the flavour is gone and the jelly without any specific taste remains.
5,Golf Happens,I really enjoyed this book. I am a new golfer and I found this book very informative. It provides the reader the history of the game. It also provides information and ideas to help your game. It has drills and techniques the reader can use to better their individual enjoyment and skill of the game. Much of the ideas are presented in a humorous way which helps in the readers retention. The author also shares some individual stories about when he was a golf club pro which are very entertaining as well as informative. I highly recommend this book. It is quick and worthwhile read!
5,Love these plates,"I have been searching for modern dishes that can withstand everyday use, dishwasher safe and have a great modern look. Well this is it! The food looks great when you serve it, and since they are a decent size I use these for side dishes or even breakfast."
1,"Well, it pumps...","I guess you get what you pay for. It fits a gallon jug, and it usually pumps (usually), but the pumping mechanism is separate from the fixed part... as in it is free-floating, and it can fall out. The liquid in the container can spill out. Overall, this is not a ""good"" product, only a ""functional"" one... and even that rating is marginal. If I were to buy another pump (and I will have to soon, I'm sure), I would not even consider these. I do not recommend that anyone waste their money on these pumps."
5,Really good read..,"I didn't expect to get what I got out of this book. It was really good and such a sweet story. Kind of sad, the love for this young guy to his baby boy. It was a really good story I loved to read...and I reccommend it."
4,Hanging on to max,"I very much enjoyed the book Hanging on to Max for many reasons. I liked how it portrayed Sam's character as not just another irresponsible teenager. The author's writing style of using flashbacks had the reader itching to get to the next chapter. I think the author grasped the hardships of being a teenager perfectly. It was a book I could really relate to. It is a book about a typical teenage boy named Sam and his life. He made some wrong decisions and got his girlfriend pregnant. Sam takes full responsibility for his new son Max, and not has to learn how to juggle homework and changing diapers."
4,hanging on to max,Sam is a sr. in hs when he finds out his girlfriend is having a baby and giving it up. sam decides he will become a single parent. He makes changes in his life and learns how hard it is to be a parent.I loved this book. It was interesting to read because it was all about teenagers and the problems they face. I loved the idea of a male stepping up and taking responsibility. I like how the author used flashbacks.
4,its an okay book!!!!!!!!!,This book was ok. It's about a highschool student name Sam and he has a child named Max. This is his senior year and he has so much things to take care of. It really was dramatic and astonishing. I gotta give propz to sam because he was doing all the work and taking care of his child. Many young adults go through this phase of sex and pregnacy. Sam's dad and his aunt is very supportive and caring. DO you think Sam will give up Max or will he keep him for life?
5,Great!,"OK i'm 13 years old and I just,just finished reading this book. AWESOME BOOK!!!!! you should deffinatly read it!It's one of the best books I ever read! So READ IT! I think just about anyone would like it, but it may be a little too mature for kids under about 12, depends on the kid but anyways, great book!!"
3,"Starts out great, then finishes weak","We read this book in our school book club last year. It was a good read, realistic dialogue, and had engaging characters. However, it was as if the author got tired of writing at the end. Without giving away the ending, it was disappointing how easily decisions were made and stuck to after a full year of the main character going to school and trying to take care of his baby. It was too abrupt for me."
3,Hanging On To Max,The book Hanging On To Max is a very good book but in ways kind of hard to understand due to the way the author wrote it. I liked it a lot though due the fact the i can relate to it my friends are young teenagers and are having kid its sad but its the real world.
3,Hanging on to Max,"I liked the book because it was a cute story. This story was about a teenage parent, and we need alot more of them type of books around. This type of book teaches teens like me that it's hard to be a parent at a young age, and there is a lot of difficulties that come along the way. I thought that this book taught a lot for being a low level book. It had a good story to it, but not a good ending."
4,teen parents,The book holding on to max was to me a good book. i thought it is a good book for teens to read coming in to high school. because it shows what u have to go through being a teen parent. If teens read this book may they will think before having sex with someone.
4,Hanging Onto Max,"Hanging Onto Max was a very good book to read. It talked about issues that a teenager my age would be going through. I felt comfortable reading it and discussing it with fellow classmates. The main character, Sam is the father who is trying to make the best of his life and his sons. He shows maturity and also his ability to stay a teenager at heart. I enjoyed reading about Max's little fusses and how Sam would deal with them. Sam's stuggle to keep a low profile about having a child showed throught the entire book. I didn't appriciate that too much. Plus the readimg level was too easy for my interest."
4,good stuff,"Surprisingly this was the first book I've ever enjoyed reading besides Son of the Mob. At the end of each chapter, I just didn't want to put it down. There was so much emotion and painstaking hours that Sam spent to assure that Max was okay. I look up to any 17 year old that could do what Sam Pettigreau did.I think thats awesome for a 17 year old to act on adult responsibilities when they were needed.I would reccomend the book to just about anyone. The book could keep anyone hooked on it, waiting, wanting to read more, it's just that interesting. The story line was great, it was intense, overall fun to read throughout the whole book. All i wanted to do was read it all this book all the time, and that's something i ""RARELY"" ever do, along with actually for once in my life bringing this book home. Thats truely a first for me, it was just that good."
1,worst purchase ever,"I am very glad that I spent very little on this book. It was a waste of what I did spend. One would think, that by looking at the cover and title, that this book would be about actually working on your car. It is not. It basically tells you to take your car to the mechanic every other page. I was very excited when I first opened the book, and flipped through the index, and it had a section titled ""DIY: clean your fuel injectors"" I was wanting to do this so I flipped to the corresponding page. It described how to pour injector cleaner into the gas tank.I kept on flipping through, and found more wastes of time,and even some incorrect information.I used to own a copy of ""Auto Repair for Dummies"" I intended to order that, but ordered this instead because it was cheaper. Auto Repair for Dummies tells you how to work on your own car so you can avoid most expensive mechanic fees. Do not waste your time on this book! BLEH"
2,"To pretty, not enough substance","I was very disappointed with the item and ultimately returned it (and I never return anything from Amazon!). I spent about 30 minutes reading through the book when it arrived, but it seemed to focus more on ""go ahead girl, you too can fix your car"" and less on ""this is how you actually fix your car."" I could have done less with the girly font, and more with useful diagrams and pictures. The text is dense and pictures few.I also bought ""Auto Upkeep: Basic Car Care, Maintenance, and Repair"" by Michale & Linda Gray and it is awesome. I have now been using that book, and it really helped me when I went to the mechanic last week to argue for a fair price."
4,Stereotypes,"This book supports the cultural assumption that all men know everything about cars. I'll give one example of how shallow it is. I looked up the section about if you're not getting any heat in your car. It states that you may have a problem with heater core, a valve, or the motor itself. It then shows a diagram with no illustration of the valve they're talking about. Left hangin."
1,"More interior decorating, than ""repair""","I was just given this book for Christmas, and the first page I randomly flipped to was How to Use a Seatbelt. The second page I flipped to was How to Remove a Bumper Sticker. Not exactly the repair advice I was looking for."
5,Great movie!,"Director Alejandro Almenabar made his directorial debut with this movie, enlisting the help of his buddies, actors Eduardo Noriega and Pele Martinez, who also appear in his fantastic follow-up, Abre Los Ojos.This movie will scare the daylights out of you without hardly showing any violence. Like The Blair Witch Project (only much better), Thesis relies on the suggestive power of sound, where the violence is filled in by the viewer. It's refreshing to see a movie about violence without a lot of it to depict it.The only if I would put on this movie is the protagonist's decision-making towards the end. She falls into the horror film ""run, stupid!"" formulaic scared victim.All in all, however, I recommended it."
4,Wow--Amenabar is a creative director,"At first watching this film, I was a little confused becuase I watched it without subtitles and I am not a native Spanish speaker. But after watching the ""Making-Of"" on the DVD, Amenabar's description of scenes and the subject matter of the film, it made much more sense. The shots themselves were a bit dark, but it gave the story an added mysterious quality. I loved the way the the viewer almost never saw actual images of the ""snuff"" films so it added to the viewers fear. By not being able to see, only hear, the films, it makes the viewers personal fears and imagination run wild. I would definatly see this again to pay attention to the small details in the characters personality and in the great directing by Amenabar. For his first large feature film, he did amazingly. This movie will make you want to see more of Amebabar's later works.Excellente!"
3,Película loca de Asesinato,"Pienso que esta película se hizo bien, espcially porque el director eran tan joven cuando vino en teatros. La línea del complot es difícil de seguir a veces, pero ofrecer una emoción buena para el espectador. Los ángulos de la cámara y el misterio cambiantes lo hacen una película interesante. Si usted no quiere sangre coagulada, esta película no es para usted, especialmente porque la primera escena del mueve es una cinta de vídeo de una mujer que obtiene brutalmente asesinado."
3,La protaganista abajo repaso,"Esta película tiene un foco en una chica y su tesis sobre imagines gráficas de violencia y los medios de comunicación. Si Ud. quiere gastar tiempo con esta personaje, sugeriría que Ud. conoce esta protagonista. Siento que ella se pone su misma en sus propias situaciones peligrosas. Sé que no habría una película si ella no estuviera en estas situaciones que crispa los nervios, pero ella se relea con otros personajes en que nadie debe confiar. No fue sorprendida cuando la audiencia aprende quien es la antagonista y aunque uno de sus amigos es inocente, él todavía es horripilante. También ella juega con los emociones del amigo inocente. Debió decidir en quien ella confía antes de viendo la verdad de los videos de Snuff. Ella es redimida un poco cuando ella dejó su tesis y para su obsesión escalofriante de violencia y la muerte."
4,subtitle warning,"This movie is good but I just want to warn people that the subtitles are not digital or optional, rather part of the movie image. So native speakers or people who want to practice their Spanish may be disappointed."
4,great movie,"wow- we watched this in spanish class this year and im very impressed. as much as i generally do not like subtitles, it actually added to the whole thing. im not going to retell the plot because im sure other reviews have already done that, but for someone learning spanish, movies like this are a good way to create some enthusiasm."
4,Prepare to be Shocked,"The things that make this movie really enjoyable are the unexpected twists and turns the plot takes. It is one of the most suspenseful movies I have seen in a long time, and the subtitles don't detract from that. So the movie itself is great (but if you are not yet desensitized to brutal acts of violence, you will probably be horrified). But there are some things the DVD version doesn't have that it should have. For example, you can't turn off the subtitles like you can with most DVDs. So even if you speak Spanish and don't need subtitles, you have to see the English words at the bottom. Also, there aren't very many extras that come with this DVD; at least as DVDs go. But the film is gripping and suspenseful, and if you're a collector of good foreign films, this would be a great one to have."
5,"A Powerful ""Thesis"" of a Film...","In my very subjective opinion, Alejandro Amenabar's Thesis is the film Joel Schumaker wished that he could've made when he did 8MM with Nicholas Cage. It gets into the subconcious in ways that many American films deemed as ""suspensful"" don't. I daresay that they only scratch the surface while Thesis burrows underneath. The film is about the darkness that lurks beneath the sweet and sugar facade, about the human condition and how far some people are willing to go in the world, even if it means their life to get an answer. I'm not going to give you a synopsis but what I will do is challenge you to a viewing if you haven't seen it. Track it down, make the effort, borrow it from your friend with the obscure film collection. By the end you'll see that Alejandro Amenabar is a master at his game and that a lot of these American film directors need to go back to school."
4,catty,"esta pelicula es ridiculo. Tenia nerviosa todo el tiempo y nunca sabia que occurira. Los personales principales hacia los papeles muy bien. Pienso que Amenabar es un director fantastico y sinceremente es un genio. Esta pelicula es muy interesante y impressivo para una pelicula hacia en cinco semanas y con poco pesos. Es un comenta de aspectos sociales, grafico, y increible."
4,Zach's Review for Thesis,"Tesis es una pelicula muy interesante. Tesis es un escalofriante. Amenábar es un director nuevo, pero el es innovador. Ana Torrent actúa bien.Usualmente, no me gustan películas de terror, pero me gusta Tesis."
4,sangre y suspenso,"Tesis es una buena pelicula de horror con mucho accion y buenos actores. La pelicula le da mucho miedo a los espectadores porque es espantosa y realista. El dato que esta pelicula es sobre una realista evento hace la mas espantosa. La pelicula muestra la vida de una muchacha que es el proximo victima de un asesino que graba sus acciones en video.El director era muy profesional y creativa. La banda sonora es muy espantosa. El montaje hizo la pelicula mas espantosa tambien.Es una buena pelicula por las personas que quiren sangre y suspenso, pero no es por los jovenes. La pelicula le dara a Ud. frialdades desde los dedos del pie a la cabeza."
3,Tesis,"Tesis es una pelicula de horror. NOrmalmente no me gusta las peliculas de horror porque solamente pienso que voy a vomitar. Pero eso no paso con Tesis. No senti mal durante Tesis porque fue un pelicula de horror con no puse su enfoca en sangre, pero en el resumen y las acciones y decisiones de los personajes. Con eso, hicieron una pelicula que me dio el choique de ganso, fue emocionante, y es un escalofriante. Lo recomiendo a todo la gente que gusta peliculas que te deja pensando."
3,Las Peliculas de Horror,"Cuando vi a Tesis, yo estaba muy critica porque no me gusta esta tipa de pelicula. Pero me gusta que el director no uso muchas imagenes inquietantes. Habia alguna escena que no me podia mirar pero el resto de la pelicula era mas interesante que repugnante. Me gusta esta pelicula mas que otras de horror porque tiene mucha suspense que demandaba mi atencion. Me interesa la fascinacion de Angela sobre el muerte, violencia, y Bosco. El director hizo un buen trabajo de mostrar las emociones confusas que Angela sentaba. Tambien me gusta que el cuento era imprevisible y no podia predecir las proximas escenas. Creo que la pelicula apoya una leccion vital: que no puede juzgar una persona sobre su aparicion. Entonces, yo recomiendo Tesis para las personas que les gustan una experiencia de confusion y suspense."
1,Kindle pricing way too high...,"I'm going to have to stop buying this series...I just can't justify this pricing model. The books have been out for 20 years or so, and are available for pennies on the dollar EVERYWHERE...it just makes no sense to have these priced at $7.99.These books should be $2.99 or less for the Kindle version...there is no printing or distribution cost to associate with it, and the publisher provides one digital copy for re-distribution.I'm done with greedy publisher & greedy authors...I have WAY too many other ways to spend my disposible income...time they all understand that and price accordingly."
2,False Advertising,Great book but what Amazon is advertising as the unabridged audio cassette edition is really the heavily abridged edition. Two 1-hour cassettes vs 18 hours for the unabrdged edition... Go figure! I feel just a tad raped...
1,Not memorable,I don't recall buying this so because the purchase wasn't memorable I decided to give it a failing review. I am not sure when I purchased this if I purchased it. But you would think that i would or else I would remember it but I don't. They should definitely try harder the next time.
4,Belkin DELL LEATHER FLIP CASE,The case works fairly well. The main screen opening is slightly off center with the Pocket PC inserted. The magnetic closure does not work very well with the unit inside.
1,Not designed for the X30,"I ordered this case because I liked the design, which incorporates enough storage space to serve as a combination case and wallet. The product description states that the case is designed for the dell axim. I was disappointed to find that it is not designed for the X30. The case slightly tapers at the bottom, so that the wireless enable and microphone buttons, at the side, are pressed down when you put the PDA in the case. The opening for buttons is misaligned, either leaving a space in the case at the bottom or covering the smaller buttons. The opening at the side exposes the headphone jack, but covers the jog dial. Furthermore, the opening at the top for the antenna is small and round, whereas the Axim X30's antenna is larger and rectangular."
3,Great coffee maker - for a while.,"I loved this coffee maker for all it's positive features - programmable, keeps coffee hot for a LONG time in its wonderful carafe, easy settings etc. BUT...after replacing it three times, it's time for a change. They work great for several months, even a year or so, then something always goes wrong and it starts dumping the coffee all over the counter and floor - not a pleasant sight when one first arrives in the kitchen in the morning. I went to great pains to try to clean out any plugged up areas and the parts came apart but the 'nipple', if you will, that pours the coffee into the carafe would not stay in place. The heating element (or some kind of spring) is now exposed, rendering the entire machine useless. I've had enough! Bought a Cuisinart today. Fingers crossed..."
1,LEAKED,"WHEN WE FILLED THE POT WITH WATER THE FIRST TIME, IT LEAKED ALL OVER THE COUNTER TOP & FLOOR.WE IMMEDIATELY PUT IT BACK IN THE BOX AND RETURNED IOT"
1,twice no luck,"so I read reviews, and said lets try it, first unit stopped working after a week, then I got a replacement and it stopped working after two days ! Stopped working means I press the ON button and nothing happens, it just sits there. I can maybe see getting one lemon, but two in a row...ouch! so I feel that the quality just isn't there, and at about $90 I would expect more. No more Zojirushi products for me."
3,ok but .....,"Purchased this coffee maker in Nov. 07. Worked great for 6 months and then stopped working. Water would not go through the maker. Called customer service who stated that I could return it for repairs at any of there service places (which I did). Now 2 1/1 months later, still no coffee maker. Repair shop wants $15 to ship it back. Zojirushi said they contacted the repair shop and told me I would get it back free of charge. Well still no coffe maker. I believe I will never get it back. Its a good coffee maker, but I'm not willing to shell out another $90 for a pot that will only last 6 months."
3,Generally favorable with one excepton,"We have had the coffeemaker--or the similar, earlier model--for over one year and we are generally pleased with its performance. The one negative, it terms of making great coffee, is that when the water is sprayed into the coffee grounds it does so only in the center of the cone. It takes much more coffee grounds to make a strong cup than if the spray wand was dispersing the water over a greater surface area of coffee. Often when finished there is a small dip in the grounds where the water was concentrated."
2,Good but not great!,"OK, like most of you I'm a coffee FREAK...for over 20 years I've been looking for the perfect coffee maker. I THOUGHT I found it with this one.For a while it worked just GREAT!Yes, the top of the carafe is hard to open unless you're Arnold...but I'll put up with almost anything for great coffee in the morning.However the one thing that drives me NUTS is that it overflows and makes a mess all over the counter and floor. (This morning finally pushed me over the edge...thus...this review.)I even returned this unit and got a completely brand new one and it too, after a year began exhibiting the same problem. Somehow, the coffee just does NOT drain properly out of the basket.OK, so I grind my coffee almost to a fine powder...I like coffee strong...I want it to talk to me in the morning.I GUESS that if you like your coffee weak then this is the coffee maker for you. For me...I've got to keep looking."
2,Useless for 10 cups of coffee,"This machine works reasonably well for up to 6 cups of strong coffee but anything beyond that is a disaster. We like strong European style coffee and the filter cannot cope with 4 or 5 large scoops and 10 cups of water. It floods the filter and there are grinds and water in the pot and all over the counter top. Also the plastic prong on the top cover broke within the first week and it is a slow pourer.I had to swing the arm back into the water chamber when making 10 cups when it reached about 8 cups as the filter was full to overflowing and wait until it had filtered down enough to resume. Finally it gave up the ghost and so did I. I have now purchased a DTC-975 BKN Coffee maker, here on Amazon , which seems to have good reviews on the whole, and is a 12 cup Thermal so fingers crossed it will do a better job."
1,SUCKY,"This product sucks! Don't buy!!!! Had it for one year and then it quit.I did proper maintenance by cleaning it monthly, but it still brewed at a ridiculously slow rate before crapping out altogether."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"Four months after we bought this coffee maker, it leaked out of the bottom when we turned it on, and now it doesn't work.Minor quibbles: because of its poor design the top is difficult to open and align for pouring - can't get a good grip on it, and the mark that indicates proper alignment for pouring is difficult to see.I don't know why I bought this. I have a Zoji bread maker, and numerous attempts to get customer support never received a reply."
2,You're Not Hot,"My major complaint is the coffee initially does not come out hot enough; it's lukewarm. The thermos is the main reason why I purchased this product, so the coffee will remain hot 30 minutes later for my family to enjoy. The temperature of the coffee totally defeats the use of the thermos. I have to nuke each cup of coffee or heat up the milk."
2,Too Many Issues,"We've had this coffee maker for a couple of months now and we're giving up on it. From the lack of water filter, to the poorly thought-out two-piece top, it has design issues.What finally did it in is it started overflowing. We had not had this issue for the first ... well, up until last week. After a thorough cleaning, it still overflows. We used all the tricks people have listed here, but it overflows both inside in the filter and in the funnel to the coffee pot itself.So it's done. Hoping to move on to something well designed and actually works."
2,Zojirushi - Not Quite Right for Us,"Although many like this coffee pot we did not. A #4 reusable gold filter wouldn't fit so you have to use paper, the machine feels top heavy and not very well made and the water reservoir does not lift out for filling. We ended up sending this back and went with the Delonghi which we are VERY happy with!"
3,thermos not as good as expected,"I purchased this coffeemaker based on all the glowing reviews.It makes a fine cup of coffee, and very quickly, but if a good thermosis important to you, forget this model. It keeps the coffee warmonly about an hour. My old Cuisinart GrindNBrew thermos was muchbetter."
4,Long-term assessment,"Five years after I bought it, my Zoji has just about died. Bad news for me. Good news for you because it inspired me to write about how well it performed over the long-term.Basically, I've been pleased with the Zoji. I'd go so far as to say it was the best coffee maker I ever owned -- if also the priciest. I experienced the overflowing problem a few times. Not enough to make me regret buying it. And that was the sum total of all the problems I encountered up until this week, when first the ""auto"" button broke, then the thing stopped perking about midway through the cycle.Now I need a new one, but considering that my first lasted five years -- I think it's a fair bet my replacement will also be a Zoji."
2,Good but not good enough,"This is a great coffee maker but full of design flaws. When put the lid on, not even real tight it will be impossible to get off after making coffee. The lid expands and makes removal it almost impossible.The thermal carafe must be directly under the hole or coffee maker or it will spill. The guts of this product are all plastic, and when you get the water extra hot as this product does, you can't help but get that plastic taste that you would not get with stainless steel.I would not recommend buying this product."
2,7 Month Lifespan,"I was reasonably happy with this product until it expired in it's 7th month. Still under warranty, yes, but their terms require you to ship the product to one of just a few 3rd party repair shops. You must also pay them shipping and handling to ship the product back to you after they have obtained parts and hopefully fixed it.$30 worth of shipping to fix a $50 coffee maker is hardly what I would call a warranty.Yes, it did make very good coffee. But the carafe lid sticking between the closed and pour positions (you have to twist it) was truly aggravating."
5,Finally! A well designed thermal coffee maker!,"I purchased this coffee maker about 4 months ago to replace a Mr. Coffee which had design flaws causing it to leak frequently. This ""Zoji"" is a dream of a machine! Easy to use, easy to clean, great tasting coffee, and stays hot for hours! No more burnt taste...and it hasn't leaked or overflowed a single time since I started using it!! No more waking up to a mess because I didn't place the pot PRECISELY in the exact spot it should be. I even tried to offset the pot to see if it will leak, and no problem!!! I am very pleased!!!"
3,quick but not hot enough,I have always had a stainless steel thermos and have appreciated the heat it can generate and maintain. I do notice that the stainless steel of this thermos is much lighter therefore not thick enough? Brews quickly but not hot enough as the Cuisinart I previously had.
2,Can you get your hand in the carafe to clean it? I CAN'T!,"WHAT are the people who design this stuff thinking? I don't want to put in some cleaner and wait and pour it out, I want to SCRUB my coffee pot.I bought it after reading so many good reviews on it - what are the people who review this stuff thinking? - took it out of the box, saw the flaw with the carafe, and thanks to Amazon, am immediately sending it back. Oh, and the quality? Incredible, it is lightweight enough to be made out of papier-mché. Is it?So, on goes my quest for a decent coffee maker. One that is apparently glass with a big opening for EASY cleaning, quality no object since they're mostly all junk today, probably a Mr. Coffee since a higher price doesn't guarantee a really good product, one that permits a permanent filter since I don't DO paper filters, and, MOST OF ALL, one that doesn't REQUIRE WATER FILTERS. What a scam, the requirement of water filters.Oh well, welcome to this century. What a world."
2,Zojirushi Thermal Carafa Coffee Maker (FLOP) DEAD in 4,"I was so taken in by the design and sleek style of this coffee brewer.What a mistake that was. The store where I purchased this raved and raved on what a quality product this company produced, in terms of bread makers. Well it appears to be a different story with the coffee maker. I paid $90.00 for this item on Jan 20, 2013, today is Jan 24, 2013. Coffee pot program buttons work but that is it. I have cold water sitting in the pot, coffee in the filter and noting. (DEAD), so I called the store where I bought it and they are not as excited on taking it back as the raves I received when buying. I also called the service department at Zojirushi and they were surprised at the issue and said the store should take it back. I can see this is going to be a pain in the ass. Anyway it is up to you, if you want to spend $90.00 and hope for the best, and then do so. Me I am going back to Bunn."
3,Not Good For Less Than Full Pot,"This coffee maker is fine if you make a full pot. The optimal brewing temp is 200 degrees and this one comes close at 180-185 degrees. The problem is there is no setting for making less than a full pot. The ideal brew time is 6 min, so with half a pot, the brew time is about 3 min, resulting in weak tasting coffee."
2,Great functionally but not in flavor,"I scoured over the reviews on Amazon for the right coffee maker to replace the shoddy one that I had from college. The Zojirushi fit pefectly. There is an abundance of positive feedback from other customers. After receiving mine, I agreed with most of the positive feedback. It's easy to use, cleans up easily, and makes a hot cup of coffee. I particularly was pleased with the Thermal Carafe, which was a feature I was looking for while shopping.My problems arose from the coffee itself. After trying different beans and varied amounts, I could not make a strong cup of coffee. In fact, my wife and I agreed that the coffee had very little flavor at all. We decided to return this item because of the flavor.For US$90 I should get not just a great functioning coffee maker, but also a great tasting cup of coffee as well."
3,For warm coffee lovers everywhere,"If you do not fill the carafe with hot water before you make the coffee it will not be hot. Can't believe I paid about half price for this and feel like that's too high. The hardware is bordering on cheaper made coffee makers, but it does make good coffee and quickly. You can have a cup or two of hot coffee if you don't dawdle-in 10 minutes it's barely warm. Highly overrated and overpriced everywhere, IMO. If you insist on having your coffee hot, this is NOT the machine for you. I found no mechanical or spillage problems with common sense use."
4,"Great coffee maker, keeps coffee warm for hours","I bought this to replace a leaky Cuisinart Grind & Brew. It makes great coffee; the carafe keeps the coffee warm for hours. It's also pretty easy to clean. A couple of caveats--my old machine had a charcoal filter and this does not. I noticed a big difference in the taste of the coffee when I just used tap water, so now I use filtered water and the coffee tastes great. Also, the controls are not totally intuitive. The program indicator light is pretty small so I always feel the need to double check to make sure it's really set up for my morning brew."
3,Good brew,Had this for a couple of years now and it is still working well. Makes a very good cup of coffee and the carafe keeps it warm for some time. Much better than the glass carafes that burn the brew if left for an hour or so. I wish it was such a slow pourer. I read that from other reviews but though that wasn't a big deal. I need to practice patience in the AM to fill my cup. OM.
2,"Works Great, Until It Doesn't","I loved this coffee maker so much, I bought it twice.The first one worked for several years, and it was great: the coffee was very well brewed, and the carafe is awesome. The temperature and speed of brewing seemed great for a full-bodied but not bitter coffee, and the thermal retention of the carafe was off-the-charts. I could finish a pot twelve hours after brewing and it was still passably hot.I recommended it to a neighbor, and they loved until it died. Then, when mine died, I ordered another exactly like it. Then IT died.The problem is clearly that the heating element/tube is sensitive to scale. Despite a semi-regular cycle of vinegar, my last one still gave up the ghost with no warning.If you don't mind replacing your coffee maker every 1-3 years then I can genuinely recommend the Zojirushi. Other than being VERY tall for a coffeemaker, it is perfect. Until it dies."
1,Very Disappointed... Don't Buy,"The Carafe on this unit is a big disappointment. The vacuum seal on the carafe has failed. Both water and air are seeping into the internal walls of the unit. This is preventing the carafe from functioning properly and maintaining coffee at a hot temperature for any long length of time.I called the customer service department at Zojirushi to report this issue. Boy, was that a big waste of time!I would strongly recommend getting a different product due to the fact that a replacement carafe will set up back about $38.00. Not worth it!!!BTW... the carafe lasted less than 1 1/2 years."
2,Quit working after a couple of months,This coffee pot was great when it worked but it quit working after a couple of months. It's sitting in the box in my garage. I would buy something other than this product.
4,hot n quick,"great coffee maker, makes full pot in eight minutes.Coffee carafe keeps it hot three and half to four hours.Put good coffee in and get good coffee out."
4,Seems OK,"Don't know what all the hoop-la is about the top being difficult to get off; it works fine, no problems at all. However, I have encountered difficulties switching from 'Auto"" to ""ON"" when I wanted to make coffee immediately. It might have been me, but I'm pretty sure it was the pot. Had to reset the time so I could make coffee immediately. All in all, it seems pretty good, but size # 4 filters are bit too big for the holder; you have to stuff them down to fit. Yes, I would buy it again."
4,quality brewer,i have owned this for nearly years and it has made flawless coffee since the first pot - haven't found a single reason to buy anything since.(updating April 2011 - still own it and it is still working flawlessly)
1,Zojirushi EC-BD15BA Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker,This coffee maker was a big disappointment from the get-go. The carafe is so thin that it holds the heat for about 3 minutes tops. There is no heating plate so one must rely on the carafe to keep the coffee warm which it doesn't. For the price paid this product is really a rip off and the manufacturer should be ashamed. I used this machine for two days before my wife went down to Sears and bought a Mr. Coffee for half the price. It has a glass carafe but we just poor coffee into the old carafe from our old coffee maker which we wore out. I highly recommend this coffee maker be purchased for use as an ornamental display object only. It looks good but the practical functionality ends there.
1,The coffee is hot but poor design.,"I purchased this coffee pot after extensive research and reading hundreds of customer reviews. My big gripe with previous coffee makers is that the coffee was never hot or was brewed so quickly that there was no flavor.This coffee maker definitely makes good, hot coffee. There is only one problem and it is significant. If we make more than 7 cups (it is a 10-cup pot) it overflows during the brewing process filling the coffee with grinds and flooding our countertop. Even with 7 cups this has been a problem. I'm using store ground coffee and not espresso grind so am very suprised to be encountering this.I would NOT recommend this for anyone who wants to turn on the coffee pot and walk away. We have to babysit it every morning and have issues at least twice each week."
2,Does not brew very hot coffee,"From what I have read, one of the most important things about a coffee maker is that the water temperature should be 190-210 degrees in order to brew the best coffee. When I first received this one, the temp was around 140 and it made much worst tasting coffee than my $25 Mr Coffee. I sent it back to the manufacturer who tested it and found that the temperature was too low and the carafe ""no good"" as the return slip said. They replaced it, but the coffee still tastes much worse than my old Mr Coffee and it cost 3 times as much.Waste of money."
2,Disappointment Galore!,"I bought this on Jan. 30, 2010 on the strength of the positive reviews. For the money I paid, I could have bought 2 ""Mr. Coffee"" coffeemakers!This unit never got the water as hot as I wanted, i.e. hotter than your run-of-the-mill and cheaper appliance. The water temperature never improved despite my diligent adherence to the instructions in the user's manual. I lived with it and would have tolerated it longer but it died on me on its 14th month of minimal usage (I brew coffee at home just once or twice a week, usually weekends).For something that's just 'good enough', $80-some dollars is too much to pay! Hence, the 2 stars."
4,coffee maker,"I love fresh coffee, all day long. This compact coffee maker does the job. It is simple and makes great coffee."
2,Our coffee often ends up all over the counter.,"It does it often enough that we cannot use the automatic settings, and have to stand over it to make sure that it's flowing into the carafe, repeatedly checking water level, and trying to figure out if it's actually going into the carafe. This is an absolute PAIN, and we might as well be making coffee the old fashioned way, pouring hot water into a cone manually (which by the way, makes absolutely better coffee). We tried different coffee grounds, making sure everything is absolutely clean and it still does it! I want to love the coffee maker as so many other people do, but there are just too many problems...the coffee tastes great...when it's not running all over the counter."
4,Good coffee maker for the price,"We've used this for more than a month and are quite satisfied with the quality of coffee brewed. The timer is very easy to set, which is not always the case with other makers, and the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for more than enough time. But like other brands of thermal carafes we have had (Braun, especially) it pours slowly and dribbly, unlike a non-carafe pot. That's one drawback, and another for this machine is the rather ridiculous necessity of having to cut the top quarter inch off a number 4 filter. That has to be done to enable the spray head to return to its proper position after you close the lid; otherwise the spray head will mash down the filter when it returns, preventing proper brewing. Anyone considering purchasing this maker should first measure the distance between their counter top and cupboards. This machine is too tall for us to be able to place beneath the cupboards."
2,Disappointed in build quality and performance,"I'm new to reviewing...I bought this coffee maker to replace a Bodum Santos electric vacuum pot... and I had high hopes.My out-of-the-box reaction was, quite simply: ""this is a really flimsy product"".When I plugged it in, my reaction to the red LED display was: ""old design"".Where the rubber meets the road:- Filling it is easy assuming you don't use the carafe. (Don't! It's really slow and awkward)- It makes ""just OK"" coffee - it's no different from any number of other percolation/drip machines. Not consistently hot - no idea why.- ""Pause"" doesn't really work - always let's some coffee drip.- Pouring from the carafe is a chore - super slow - and the screw top is thin so making it tight or loosening it is uncomfortable.It's going back!"
5,2 years.... still great,"I have had this coffee maker for 2 years and it's still working as good as day one. It brews quick and the carafe keeps the coffee hot for several hours. Hope it never dies, but if it does I'll buy another. Have recommended to all my friends."
3,earlier reviews fooled me,"I read tons of reviews looking for the best thermal carafe coffee maker I could get without spending $150. The reviews indicated that this was a great coffee maker and it is indeed OK. I gave up a Cuisinart that my husband had complained about (coffee not staying hot enough) and this maker does not even make the coffee as hot as are old one when it is first brewed. You also have to unscrew the top of the carafe to pour your coffee which is difficult at best and painful to your hands at worst.To make a long story short, I am really disappionted and will likely end up buying another one."
2,Not that impressed,"It's hard to rate this on its own merits. I had a cuisinart for three years and keep comparing this coffee maker to that one.The Zojirushi's thermal carafe is smaller than I would have liked and its very cumbersome to open- maybe once its broken in a little more it will be easier. There is this weird little ""cap"" that I assume goes in the top to help keep the coffee warm- it doesn't work very well because the coffee wasn't as hot as my Cuisinart (that stayed scalding hot almost all day). I'm not crazy about having another ""thing"" to wash and store and otherwise keep track of. It didn't come with a manual...warranty info...just the coffee maker. And the box was torn open inside the Amazom shipping box. Not just a little tear- the whole side was torn from the top to the bottom (didn't anybody notice when they packed it?). It does look nice and is apparently easy to program and use- I did it without the benefit of an instruction manual. Will buy another Cuisinart."
4,One complaint,The machine makes good coffee as advertized and the carafe keeps it hot for at least two hours. A major problem is the top of the carafe which can be difficult to unscrew and only allows a minimal stream of coffee to be poured therefore requiring a long time to fill one's cup.
3,Fresh Coffee,"I would have rated this product a five except the first carrafe came no where near meeting the Zojirushi thermal Specifications. Now that they replaced the carrafe we are very happy with the EC-BD15. We purcahsed this product because we have the large Zo bread machine and are very happy with it, used only for mixing and rising. Oven baking is still the best."
1,TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this and it worked for about eight weeks and then broke. It is under warranty, but the shipping costs to send it to an authorized service dealer is not covered. The coffee maker itself is unbalanced once you fill it with water and seems like it will tip over very easily. The lid is very difficult to screw on and off. Overall, this is a very poor quality product and not worth the money."
1,The worst Thermal Carafe Coffe ever !!,"This is the worst Thermal Carafe Coffe I ever had in my life, and have had many brands. She is beautiful and can be programmed for coffee to be done on time. There ends the good points. The thermal carafe does not keep the temperature for a long time and worst of all is the bottle cover. To open it when the coffee is ready, you must be Hercules. The cover is fine with bosses, who hurt his hand while doing to try to force it open. When making coffee, the vacuum is created even more difficult to open. If you want a good Thermal Carafe Coffe, look for a Rowenta. Note 1000!"
3,coffeemaker,this item does allthe things it is supposed to but the quality of coffee is not as good as other brands.
1,Had to give it a 1 because,"I got a thermal caraf because I wanted my coffee to stay hot. Cuisinart, it stayed warm when I put it in the fridge, until the next morning! So 6 hours later the coffee was hot enough to add milk. This one-NOT. The end - I want my coffee hot. My mistake for trying something new..."
2,Fussy Coffee Maker,"If you like to fuss around making coffee, then this is the maker for you. Step #1 is to cut 1/2"" off the#4 cone filter. Then after the coffee is made, you need to put the little cap on top of the carafe, if you haven't lost it or you cat thought it was his toy. Make the thing so it will take the #4 filter and out a place on it to store the cap and maybe it would be useful."
1,really bad design,"I sent this back before i pluged it in. who cares if it makes good coffee if the is no bucket to fill up water at the sink. You have to put the machine unter the tap or have a spare bucket. The coffee cone is under a fixed water return making it reaaly hard to fill,empty and clean. And no stainless steel cone, and it is not a standard size cone so you hunt down filters or cut them. This is much to incovienent to use every day. Clearly the designer never used this."
2,not the greatest for convenience,I thought I was going to love this product but didn't. You can't just brew and pour. The design was great but once I read the instructions I discovered that it wasn't worth the effort because I was using this to replace a much cheaper and easier to use product. I did return it and found a different one at the store.
4,Problems with Swiss gold filter,Even ground coarse with a full pot I can still get an overflow. An extra rim came for the Swiss filter but it does not fit tight - no matter how I try to spigot is too low to swing back over the grounds. So I have a good six cup coffee maker!!
3,One small design flaw,"Makes great coffee. But the lid is hard for me to turn open with my normal turning hand (my left) - I can't get a good grip and the lines on the lid hurt more than help. I do have success with my right hand, so it's not the end of the world. But why does it have to be that hard?"
2,"Good coffee, but a poor design","I bought this coffee maker about three weeks ago. It brewed a good cup of coffee and the coffee stayed warm in the carafe for a long time. However, I returned the coffee maker because the carafe lid was just too hard to open and close. Opening and closing the carafe was like struggling with a difficult jar lid. There were two other design flaws that annoyed me as well, but were not necesserily ""deal breakers"". (1)There is an arm on the coffee maker that must be moved into position before brewing. This arm extends over the coffee basket. Because the #4 filters are slightly larger than the coffee basket it requires a little extra effort to move the arm into place and keep the filter positioned properly. (2)The controls were inconviently placed on the side of the machine"
3,It's OK for its Price,"The Good: Coffee is brewed quickly, tastes fine, and it stays hot.The Bad: It doesn't pour well. The lid is crazy and hard to line up. The #4 filters the mfg. recommends have to be cut down because they're too tall. The Bunn stainless steel pour-over is a much better coffee maker but it's also twice the money."
1,Weak Coffee,"There are a lot of things I like about this coffee maker. It looks good, it brews coffee really fast, it's easy to clean. Unfortunately the thing I don't like about it is that it makes weak coffee, which is a show stopper for me and my wife.I have tried things like using two filters, using more coffee than normal, pouring the coffee through the grounds a second time. I have to say that the results really aren't worth the effort.I have never had this sort of problem with a coffee maker before, and honestly I didn't think that it would be possible to not get a strong cup of coffee out of one. I bought this coffee maker mainly on the reviews I read about it, but I can't recommend it at all. There have to be better machines out there, especially for 80 bucks."
4,Excellent coffeemaker with thoughtful design,"After checking the features and reviews on every coffeemaker I could find, I chose the Zojirushi. We have had it for about a month and find it to be an excellent product. My criteria were to have a thermal carafe that kept the coffee hot and coffee that was made with water hot enough to extract the maximum flavor from the grind. Both are satisfied. The carafe is easy to pour from and the lid can be turned to the pour position by feel; a nice bonus when I'm too sleepy to go find my glasses. The small cap that goes over the lid helps to keep the coffee hot. Also, when pouring water into the machine from the carafe it doesn't dribble or drip."
1,Very disappointed,I purchased this after doing some research and reading reviews. After I used this unit twice I returned it for a refund. The water was lukewarm at best and the sprayer didn't even get all of the grinds wet. I have now ordered a different brand with hopes of more success.
4,Best Cup of Coffee I've Ever Made,"I can't say it makes the best cup of coffee I've ever had, but it is the best cup of coffee I've ever made. I find the top a little difficult to screw and unscrew."
3,Zojirushi EC-BC15,"Great coffee maker. However, we need to warm up the carafe before we brew. If we use the automatic brew, the coffee is warm, not hot. The coffee maker does make very good coffee."
4,Good Machine,This is a good coffee maker. It has a couple of design features one of which is good and the other irritating. First it pours without dribbling. That is a feature missing in almost every other coffee maker made by anyone anywhere in the world. Kudos to Zojirushi.Second it has a water spout that you need to rotate out of the way to insert and remove the paper filter. The funnel that holds the paper filters is a little too small for the recommended filters. As a result you have to crush the top of the filter down to get the water spout back over the middle of the grounds. This is not a biggy but is irritating as the whole thing could have been ameliorated if the whole machine were half inch taller or the carafe were fatter and half inch shorter so the funnel could be half inch deeper.Good buy in any case.
4,Wish it brewed a little hotter,"I think it looks great and is easy to clean. I have not had any problems lining it up like some of the reviews have said. The only think I wish it did was brew at a hotter temperature. We got in, in part, because the reviews said it did have a hot temp., unfortunately, I throw a little milk in there and I have to microwave it. On the other hand, it does stay warm for a long time, and everything is cool to the touch so you can take it with you and enjoy the coffee."
4,zojirushi carafe coffee maker,"Very happy with my new coffee maker. Carafe keeps coffee warm for hours. Easy to use. Only issue is height, will not fit under my cabinets. Other than that, great purchase, very satisfied"
3,Zojirushi coffee maker,"This is a great coffee maker. The coffee stays hot for several hours. The thermal carafe is well made. The cone drip chamber helps to extract the all the coffee flavor. It brews quickly. Three stars becuase the housing is cheap, thin plastic and I am sure something will crack or break off within a year of so."
1,Stopped working in less than 1 year,"Bought this June 2010.... stopped working, when turned on nothing happens... waste of money for less than a year of use....."
2,Loved it for 18 months,"This unit was high on a consumer ratings website. I loved the idea of brewing directly into a thermal carafe. Brew temperature was excellent. Carafe kept coffee hot for 6 to 8 hours. Then one day 18 months later, it did not brew anymore. I tried everything. Lights and digital clock all work. I can program to come on or start it manually to no avail. At the appointed time, the ON light signals brewing, but it never heats the water and never starts to brew coffee. I am starting to lose confidence in the consumer ratings company also. Switched brands of coffeemakers. We will see how long the Hamilton Beach Brew and Dispense coffeemaker lasts."
1,Carafe leaks badly between inner and outer layers,"The carafe of this coffee pot leaks very badly between the inner pot and the outer pot, thus the insulating space between the 2 layers fills up with water, coffee, etc, and continues to leak relentlessly, forming and unsafe and unsanitary condition. When calling the manufacturer for instructions under the warranty, person on phone was helpful with the process, but clearly did not beleive there was any problem at all, she kept saying how ""strange"" such a leak is. Will see how effective the warranty is. Pot was purchased February, 2011, this is June,2011, the product failed very quickly for the money."
1,Piece of Junk,Bought it on December 29. Stopped working on June 24. Several dumps of coffee and grounds on the kitchen counter and floor. Piece of Junk
5,Love this,this is my second Zojirushi coffee pot. I have had a other brands in the past- but none as durable and reliable as this one- Love the stainless steel carafe-keeps coffee hot and I can't break it!
5,Zojirushi Coffee Maker,I have been making coffee with this machine for a month now and I like the product. It's easy to use and clean the thermos jar. It makes good drip coffee. The only complaint is that the jar's lid is sometimes difficult to turn to open and difficult to see to align 2 black dots on the lid which is also black plastic.
3,Great til it breaks!,"Bought this coffeemaker based on having great review and thermal carafe. Have loved it up til yesterday when it completely stopped working. I pushed the on button and the light came on but the coffee did not brew, nor did it make any sound. Yes, there was water in the reservoir etc.Called the manufacturer and will send it in for repair. Honestly, this is only six months old. Would not recommend buying it."
3,not much there,"after a great deal of research I decided on this coffee maker based on many of the reviews I had read. I was disappointed from the time I took it out of the box. It was so light and ""felt"" cheaply made, not much to it. Granted the coffee it makes is good, but I feel like the product could be priced quite a bit less. If you take the carafe away during brewing to pour a cup, you have to be real careful and fast, the hole in the top of the carafe is very small and can't handle a large flow, the machine has overflowed on my counter several times. It is easy to take apart and clean. I haven't used the programmable part, I'm afraid it will overflow. The carafe does keep coffee warm for some time. Overall, could be priced about 50 bucks less. Time will tell. . . ."
3,Easy to Use and Clean,"I have had this product for over a month and I have found it to be extremely user friendly and simple to clean. The major drawback is that the coffee dose not come out quite hot enough. Even if you pour a cup right after brewing, the coffee is more on the very warm side than hot. Another problem may be the height of the machine. It fits fine in my kitchen but if you have an older kitchen with low cabinets this may be a difficulty. However if you are looking for a very simple, time saving machine to operate and clean then this would be a good fit for you."
1,Flimsy!,Very disappointed when thus coffee maker arrived! The plastic construction was flimsy and it wobbled when I placed it on the counter. I can't believe someone would actually charge $90.00 for this!! Returned it the same day!
1,"Wish ""ZERO"" stars was an option...","There HAS to be a design flaw with this machine. I mean, how complicated can a coffee maker be? My first pot? Coffee all over the counter. WHAT? So, I get out the book. Verified it was set up correctly, used the right filters, settings, pot positioning, lid lined up just right, check check check. Next pot? Same thing. All over the counter. WHAT? So I take it apart, re-verify and do it all again. Guess what? Coffee spills out all over as it brews. Now this is just plain stupid - I don't care how hot it's supposed to keep coffee. If nothing ends up in the pot, does that feature really ever matter?"
2,Not what I was hoping for....,"This coffee maker is just OK. The biggest cons are that the coffee is not hot enough and that the paper filters don't fit very well (even the updated model that calls for a #4 cone filter). I would not buy this again, and I will probably buy a Starbucks machine to replace it as I've heard good things about those."
2,Cheaply made,"Typical made in China with cheap plastic. I guess it brews OK, buy can't imagine it lasting long."
2,Not too good,"I guess I must be a bit of a coffee snob but this coffee makers, richness and fullness when processing the coffee lacks a lot. The temperature of the coffee is a little hotter than Warm.After reading the reviews I decided on this one but I think I will send it back. I am used to my Barista from Starbucks and this one just doesn't cut the mustard.I am so glad I didn't sell my Barista I will just deal with it tempramental disposition and enjoy great coffee"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Although it probably would make coffee just fine, the Zojirushi Thermal Coffee Maker just didn't match my expectations. It seemed to be made of mostly thin, flimsy black plastic towering up 15 inches. Except for the nice thermal carafe, I didn't see anything exceptional about this unit. It just didn't seem very solid.So if I'm going to use a flimsy coffee maker that can pour the right temperature hot water over coffee grounds making flavorful coffee, I'll go back to my simple $7.99 white Walgreens Kitchen Gourmet, which probably makes just as good tasting coffee but looks less fancy. It's also less complicated without things that can go wrong. I can probably live without the thermal carafe, and I don't like black anyway."
3,No Big Deal,"After my old Delonghi brewer started leaking, I did a little online research while trying to decide which new coffee maker to purchase. Although this product has had some quality control issues, I decided to try it. I was very surprised at how flimsy it is, while my old unit was solid as a rock. The user's manual leaves a lot to be desired (and sometimes to the imagination), and the basket into which the filter is placed doesn't always seat properly. The water spout does NOT get pushed back into place when one closes the lid. It makes a decent cup of coffee, but that's about all I can say for it. For the price, it was a bit of a disappointment."
1,Wouldn't buy one again,"We have had this coffee maker for 6 months now and I get to like it less and less each day. I like my coffee HOT and this does not do the job. Even if I preheat the carafe and use a tea cozy, after an hour I am having to ""nuke"" it to bring it up to the temperature that I like. The size 4 paper coffee filters do not fit well, you must jam them in or cut them down. Placement of the controls around the side of the coffee maker is a disadvantage as you either have to fumble without seeing the controls or move the coffee maker to see the controls. Not a big deal the first time but every day? Wish we had spent the extra money and got a new Starbucks to replace our old one."
1,A great disappointment,"This product was a great disappointment. The first thing is that the #4 filter does not fit in the container. Then it does not keep the coffee hot. As soon as the coffee is poured into a mug it gets cool, and the thermos does not hold heat. I would not advise anyone to buy this item."
1,poor quality,"Coffee maker leaks all the time, flooding out kitchen floor. No matter how carefully we align the carafe, there is coffee all over the kitchen counter..."
1,DISASTER - DON'T BUY!!!!!!,"I had read all of the reviews and saw that there were a lot of positive and negative reviews. In terms of overflows, you have to be very careful how the carafe is put in place or else you will probably have problems. My big issue is that I only was able to use the coffee maker ONCE before it died. I ran a pot of water through it once to clean it (no coffee was used). I was encouraged because the brewed water temperature was 180 degrees and it worked fine. The next morning we prepared it to make coffee and it wouldn't do a thing. It had power but wouldn't brew. Don't waste your time or money ordering this one. One star is too high of a rating for this one."
2,Good but breaks,"Well, this coffee maker was as good as billed but there are some flaws. First, it is very tall so plan on having the vertical space available. More importantly, however, was that it just plain stopped working. Assuming this was a bad wire or something simple (it is a very simple machine in concept - boils water is all) I took the thing apart to find the problem. All wires were fine, there was nothing apparently wrong with it. I kept the carafe and junked the rest. This must have been a manufacturing problem so I got a good 4 months out of the thing and returned to my trusty Capresso."
2,Not crazy about this coffeemaker,"I think the coffeemaker does everything it's supposed to do except make a great cup of coffee!! Not exactly what I had hoped for! #4 filters are too big - no #3's available. My previous coffeemaker was a BUNN and I bought this one hoping to get comparable quality for less money. My advice, spend more and buy the BUNN. Just went out and bought another one. This will one go into storage to use in an emergency only. Don't waste your money."
4,First thermal for us -- we love it,"This coffee pot keeps coffee piping hot for hours, even without ""preheating"" the carafe by rinsing with hot water. We badly needed a thermal because we often drink coffee hours apart. I've tried the coffee over 12 hours later and it's still hot. Yes, the lid is badly designed for grasping, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. But we've found that turning the lid only a quarter turn past ""open"" works just fine at keeping the coffee hot. If you close it all the way, you'll have a tough time getting it back open! Another minor flaw was the lid's almost invisible ""dot"" but a dab of pink nail polish solved that problem. I highly recommend this product and am extremely satisfied with it."
5,Excellent build quality and brilliant design - Still Works Great!,I bought this one from Amazon in December 2004! Makes a perfect pot of coffee every single morning. Everything works unfailingly. We've been using the same SwissGold filter for nearly FIVE years with no problem as well.Do not waste your time or money on that $30 piece of junk machine you may be considering. Just don't do it. You will thank yourself in five years for spending the extra $60.**April 2011 Update**I can't believe I bought this coffee maker in 2004. It has seen almost daily use for 7 years and still works like it did on day one. Wonderful job Zojirushi!
4,Happy but not totally,"I bought two of these based on a high rating from another retailer. While generally pleased I find that the coffee is not brewed as hot as it is with my Starbucks coffee maker (the Barista 4 cup). The thermal carafe while keeping the coffee warm is difficult at times when it comes to pouring. Coffee just spills out from the top of the lid in addition to the pouring spout.. and yes, I do line up the dots, etc. I did find the manufacturer attentive as my original carafe was dented and they (through the seller I bought it from here on Amazon - The Handy House, an excellent seller...tops in my book) sent me a replacement. I do find it very convenient that the coffee reservoir detaches completely from the coffee maker. It makes clean up so much easier. Having lived with both of these (one at my office) I might now think twice about purchasing this brand over another based on my experience. A great product, but not as great as I thought it would be."
2,Not very good,"This coffee brewing system is not very good at all. I am very disappointed with it. The carafe is one of the worst I have ever seen. The lid does not loosen without a fight, you have to rotate the entire carafe, and it cannot be done without a lot of pressure.This is not an ergonomically designed system, either. Everything is turned 90 degrees, and makes for awkward handling."
5,5 years and still going strong,"Full disclosure, this is one of the three Zojirushi appliances I own (this coffee pot, a bread machine and a rice cooker) and I love them all. I've had this coffee pot for 5 years and it has never let me down. It the machine doesn't feel quite as heavy or solid as some brands (such as Cusinart), but the design is far superior. I agree that the water temperature you start with is very important and it never brews a HOTHOTHOT cup of coffee, but I prefer mine not to scald my tongue or to taste burnt. The thermal carafe is amazing and the coffee will still be warm up to 12 hours later. Hubby loves the timer function and has coffee wake us in the morning on a regular basis (maybe that's why I love this coffee maker so!). Paired with a Swissgold #4 permanent filter, this is a fantastic choice."
1,Good While It Lasted,"Bought this machine to replace the Cuisinart Thermal Coffee Maker that died on us after a year. The Cuisinart heating element went and the coffee suddenly started tasting plastic. When I read reviews I found out that that was typical of Cuisinart (and several people reported fires). So when the same thing began happening on the Zojirushi (funny plastic taste) after only 3 weeks, I decided to return it immediately and not risk any further problems. It's a shame because I am a big fan of the thermal pot makers for their ability to keep the coffee fresh and hot without a burner, but I can't seem to find one that will last. Trying the Militta thermal pot next, which got amazing reviews, time will tell."
2,Broken in 4 monthes,"We purchased this product with high expectations. Let me say, the coffee is delicious and stays hot for around 8 hours in the carafe. We couldn't be happier until it suddenly stopped working.We contacted customer service, who sent us a cleaning solution. Unfortunately this did not fix our problem either. Their solution now is for us to spend money to ship the coffee maker to a third party for repair.It seems to us that since this product broke after just 4 months, Zojirushi should really take it upon themselves to repair the coffee maker at no further cost to us. I strongly disagree with asking a consumer to continue to shell out money when the product is defective.Be cautious buying this product. We are very disappointed in the customer service Zojirushi has offered to us."
3,"Nice coffemaker, but it doesn't last long","I bought one of these in March of 2005, and it's already failing. I have to press 'on' two or three times to get it to brew the entire pot. Very irritating."
2,Very disappointed -- coffee goes cold fast,"It's true that the coffee is kept hot in the pot as others claim, but the problem is once it's out of the pot. Even coffee poured right after brewing quickly gets cold. I can't explain it, but it's true, and it makes this purchase very disappointing. Also, the lid for the carafe is uncomfortable and difficult to turn every time you want a refill."
1,Buyer Beware,"Our experience with the Zojirushi EC-BD15 Coffee Maker was quite disappointing. The first time we used it, water leaked from the reservoir onto our counter. We notified the Amazon vendor (Chefs Corner), who made it easy for us to return the defective machine and soon sent a replacement. Actually, Chefs Corner mistakenly sent us two replacements, and we immediately returned one. Unfortunately, the replacement machine that we kept was missing a part and, consequently, became clogged with coffee grounds and slopped coffee onto our counter. Furthermore, the carafe did a poor job keeping the coffee hot. Zojirushi clearly has quality-control problems, so we did not bother requesting another replacement. We cannot recommend this coffee maker."
4,Was skeptical...now a believer,"My husband bought this, and I thought it was very expensive for a coffee maker, and I doubted that it could keep the coffee warm without the typical warmer under the pot. I was wrong. The convenience of being able to take the coffee straight to the table is matched by how well this thermos keeps it hot. We bring a full pot to the table and read three newspapers each morning, and the last cups are always as hot as the first.The machine brews very quickly, is easy to program so that the pot is ready for you when you wake up, and it's as easy as any other maker I've had to clean. I like the fact that I can't break the pot, and I don't EVER have to worry about whether I left it on when I leave the house.So for all that, this coffee maker is worth the money, and it looks like my husband was right. Just don't tell him. ;)"
1,Dead within 2 weeks,"Quit working entirely within 2 weeks of purchase, probably made 25 pots of coffee before it stopped."
3,ok but did not last,"I liked it at first but the lid did leak, was hard to pour. Then after about a year it just stopped working. I expected more for the money. I've had cheaper that lasted much longer."
3,Messy - can't recommend,"So far this coffee maker has worked fine. However, it is difficult to pour a cup of coffee and not have spills on the countertop. The only chance you have at no drips is unscrewing the lid completely off. Otherwise coffee leaks out the top through the threads as opposed to only going through the opening. Also, the lid can be hard to unscrew after brewing a pot of coffee. If you have arthritis at all, I recommend looking at a different coffeemaker."
1,Don't Buy,I strongly recommend you do not buy the Zojirushi ED-BD15BA Coffee Maker. I bought one over a year ago and it has stopped working. I called the company and they said there is nothing they could do for me. A coffee maker that fails in a little over one year appears to be a product with planned obsolescence and escapes the one year warranty.
4,Fast!,"We purchased this product after we talked with someone else who already owned one. We have only had it for one month, but so far are very pleased. It makes coffee in record time, and the coffee stays fresh since it is stored in a thermal carafe rather than continuing to ""cook."" It is very easy to program -- no directions needed! Only complaint would be that the carafe must be unscrewed to pour the coffee; this seems slightly inconvenient, Since heat from the coffee causes the carafe lid to swell slightly, care must be taken that it is not tightened before making coffee; otherwise it can be difficult to open.Overall we think this coffee maker is great."
3,Can't stop the dripping,"My husband and I are coffee lovers. I took a lot of time and researched coffee makers. This one seemed like the best one out there. But, we are not able to pause and serve because it doesn't stop, the coffee keeps coming. And even after it is finished and we pull the carafe away, it drips. And I think the filter basket is cumbersome and takes a little while to get it properly seated. I am returning it and ordering something else."
2,Coffee Tastes OK but Maker Not Very Satisfying,"We have used the Zojirushi EC-BD15 daily for a month or so. The coffee it makes tastes fine. However, the machine is too tall, it seems to be flimsy, it is not easy to pour in the water and see the measure at the same time, the coffee holder is too small for a #4 filter to fit into properly, the mechanism to pour from the thermal pot is inconvenient, and the removable top is in two parts, one of which will surely get lost soon. Having used the pot for a month, I would not purchase it again."
2,overflow and underheat,i guess these coffee makers are luck of the draw because the one i got seems to overflow 50% of the time and the coffee doesnt stay hot. this is NOT for people who want to set the pot and forget about it because if it overflows it just keeps going. the filters have to be packed down dilligently as the lip of the filter tends to be pushed down by the how water arm as it swings across the top. this ofcourse tends to make it overflow.i would not buy this again
3,Good but not Great,"Has all the functionality of a good coffee maker as stated in many of the reviews. However the main points that leave it lacking are the screw in top for the carafe which is difficult to remove and painful to use. Must be careful when pouring coffee because hot liquid will come out the spout of the carafe and also the top. I wanted a thermal carafe to avoid burnt coffee, however the top does not seal the coffee in the carafe, it has a separate cover which to place over the top cover to reduce temperature loss. This is a poor design in my opinion. Overall, I think for the money it is a pretty good coffee maker. It is very good at what it does and the coffee will be perfect every time."
5,Best Coffee Ever!,"We are coffee lovers, and we drink a lot of it! This Zojirushi makes the best cup of coffee ever! We have tried just about all of the machines out there, using them until we wear them out. Braun has been a consistent favorite of ours, but we couldn't find the model we had always enjoyed in years past. We have enjoyed our Saeco espresso maker, so we initially purchased a Saeco coffee model. The coffee tasted pretty good, but the carafe leaked so badly when pouring, we just got frustrated and purchased the Zojirushi on a whim. We love it! It makes great coffee, and the carafe keeps the beverage hot and it doesn't leak! We would definitely purchase this model again, and when the time comes, we will purchase another Zojirushi."
1,garbage,"Unbelievable that this thing received so many good reviews. What a horribly designed piece of garbage. Shabby, ill-fitting, wobbly plastic construction. MADE IN CHINA. Standard filters don't even fit into the receiver. We had the cut off the top off of the filter just so it could fit. How is that making my life more convenient? In two days of use, it has over-flowed twice. Each time it had been set up by a different person. Both times it made a horrible mess. Just threw the entire thing into the trash in disgust."
1,Zojirushi Thermal Cofffee Maker,Despite all the hype about the thermal carafe it was a huge disappointment. Within four hours contents were cold. We returned it to seller.Les
4,Simplicity - Excellent Pot of Coffee!,"After looking at all of the ""bells-and-whistle"" coffee pots, we ended up buying this one. We have had it a few days and already love it. Simple to use, perfectly functional, and GREAT Coffee!Regarding the comments on the filter.... I guess I don't understand why people are having problems. We just put in the gold-tone filter from our old pot and we were done. Pefect fit. Just get any standard gold-tone cone filter.Overall, we highly recommend this pot!"
4,nice coffee maker,I bought this coffee maker so that we could accommodate a few guest at a time. It works great and keeps the coffee hot for a long time without getting that burned taste. This coffee pot works for us.
5,Excellent Coffee Maker,"My family Enjoys coffee, with a capital ""E."" While we use a French press on a daily basis, it's small. So, when company comes or when we have an early morning planned (thank you timer!), we pull out our Zijirushi EC-BD15BA. It brews rick, dark coffee and keeps it warm for hours in the insulated carafe. When we have to be at an early swim meet, we set the timer to have the coffee ready, and then we just take the whole pot with us for refills throughout the morning.I would highly recommend the Zijirushi EC-BD15BA for anyone who wants a drip maker but expects good results."
2,OK but not Great,"While it brews reasonable coffee, there are some annoying design flaws. The filler tube used to determine the amount of water in the reservoir is on the side of the unit and hard to see when you fill the reservoir. Also the cap for the thermal carafe retains brewed coffee inside the cap and you cannot get it out during cleaning.....not very sanitary. I had to drill two 1/4"" holes in the bottom of the carafe cap to allow drainage from the cap so I could drain the retained coffer and be able to clean the cap. The overall unit is unsually tall requiring a tall storage space, Lastly it is of flimsy plastic construction. I would not purchase another."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I selected the free shipping option on this coffee maker. It took about a week and a half to arrive and when it did, it was discovered to be Dead On Arrival. Almost no water gets into the water outlet from the reservoir. It sputters, steams, and heats the water in the reservoir, but cannot make coffee because almost no water makes it into the filter basket. The hot water just remains in the reservoir (yes the water outlet was swung out over the filter basket).I went to the manufacturer's website and attempted to contact technical support. In order to do that one needs to enter the product serial number. The website says that the serial number is on a silver label on the product. There was no silver label anywhere, hence no serial number.I gave up in frustration, and am returning this coffee maker for a full refund. Maybe I got the only bad one in the batch, but it sure wasn't worth waiting a week and a half to arrive.--Wayne"
5,Great Coffee Maker,At last - a thermal carafe coffee maker that keeps the coffee hot for hours and one that is reasonably priced.
5,My favorite coffee maker of all time!,Love this coffee maker! It arrived on time and was everything I expected and read in reviews. It takes #4 filters which are easy to find. The coffee is still hot hours later and it takes up less space on the counter than other coffee makers I've had. Make sure the basket fits properly although I've had no leaking like other coffee makes.
3,stopped working after 5 months,"although I really like this coffee pot, I have now gone through TWO of them. The first had a broken cover and I couldn't seem to buy just the cover to the pot and ended up buying another. the second one has suddenly stopped working and will not turn on."
5,coffee maker,Makes delicious coffee AND keeps it hot with the thermal carafe. Attractive and easy to use.
2,Don't buy this pot,"Most reviews seemed positive, so couldn't wait for new pot to arrive. BIG disappointment.... pot would not brew 6 cups. Grounds were unsaturated, very weak coffee. I experimented with using more coffee, but not any better. I contacted manufacturer to learn the pot is not designed for anything less than 10 full cups. So why have levels???I am returning this for a refund. J HALL"
3,Zojirushi ec-bd15 coffee maker,"This product was a disappointment to me. I expected much better quality for $ 100.00. I notice that the price is now reduced to about $80.00. Most comparable products sale for about $ 50.00 in stores.The only caveat this product has is the carafe, which does keep the coffee hotter longer. It has a v-shaped filter which cost about 2.3 cents apiece instead of the round one which cost .5 cents apiece, if you are cost conscious. Perhaps I did not read the description carefully. Quality of coffee is the same as my previous coffee makers. There is no setting for coffee strength, although I would set it at medium and never change anyway. Appears to be cheaply made with thin moulded plastic. Don't know about the electronics inside, but ok so far.Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee MakerWould not recommend for this price."
1,awful coffee maker!,"After researching and reading customer reviews, we bought this coffee maker. It was awful!! The coffee was never hot so it certainly didn't stay hot as advertised. It look sleek and cool on our counter but never lived up to any of it's hype. Don't buy it."
2,Definitely not up to par,"Being generous with a #2 rating.......Replaced a very nice Cuisinart with this junk.Did not come with metallic strainer as specified,both at Amazon and with the Zojirushi manual.Thermal carafe is truly junk compared to the Cuisinart.Does not keep coffee hot as did the Cuisinart.Does not pour as well as the Cuisinart.Manual says use #4 filter, except the #4 will not fitcorrectly unless you clip a portion of the #4 off.If you're used to quality (aka Cuisinart) don't ventureoff to this alternative.In short, I love my coffee, and am quitedisappointed with this product."
1,"Weak Coffee, Overflowing basket, Awkward Design","I'm afraid that this coffee maker has been pretty much a disappointment.First and foremost, it doesn't make very good coffee. The water is quite hot and it picks up some nice subtleties of the coffee, but the brewing speed is extremely fast which tends to create rather weak coffee without much body. The speed also makes the basket overflow extremely easily if the coffee is ground too fine or you add ""too much."" That's in quotes because in order to get a good solid cup of coffee, the right amount is ""too much.""The pot itself is rather quirky. To fully seal the vacuum pot, you need to add an external topper, which we've already lost track of, and to dispense coffee, you need to twist the cover, which can easily become stuck and require a good amount of force, to the open position. Finally, this unit is very tall and doesn't have enough weight at the bottom leaving it more than a bit tippy and awkward to place."
5,Makes a good pot of coffee,"We like everything about this coffee maker. The coffee taste great and the maker is simple and easy to use, plus cleanup is a snap. There were a couple of negatives mentioned in earlier reviews but we have not found the lid difficult to open, nor have we found the opening to be too small. For someone looking for a reasonably priced coffee maker this is it."
2,Stopped working after 6 months.,Zojirushi EC-BD15BAFresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee MakerPurchased this coffee maker because of good brewing reviews. Those were correct. However after 6 months of use the heating element has stopped working so it no longer brews. I would not recommend this to anyone. Too late to return and can find no info on repair except that it isn't worth fixing due to cost. I am tired of poor product life on electronics and small appliances.
4,keep the top off,"Previous coffee pot died. Same carafe style. This one works fine, makes good coffee but has two characteristics I would like to see improved upon. One, the top of the pot goes on after you make the coffee to better maintain temperature. If you leave it on it will still fit nicely under the filter and when you brew, the coffee goes everywhere except in the pot. I had to put a label on the side to remind myself. The other thing to consider is the very thin screw on lid. You turn this to a spot to allow coffee to pour. It can be hard to grip this and at times I've had to grab a cloth to get enough grip. Great product otherwise!"
5,Great easy coffee pot.,"This is a great coffee pot that keep the coffe hot for hours. I temped a half pot after 3 hours and it was still 165 degrees. coffee during brewing is 185 to 190 depending on the temp of the water you put in. Only thing I have a problem with is if you tighten the lid all the way on while it cold the lid gets stuck and you need a rag to loosen the top. (Because of the heat causing expantion) However, if you unscrew the lid a little before brewwing this doesnt happpen.Over all I would highly recomend this coffee maker."
2,Carafe defective,"RW: Never made particularly good coffee, and it was hard to get matching filters and other parts.But the last straw was that the carafe came apart; the base detached, and the warranty had run out.So we paid quite a bit of money for a coffee maker that lasted only a year and a half.Not worth your money. Not up to Zojirushi's usual standards -- rice maker, for example, has been outstanding."
4,Pretty great coffee maker,"I ordered this coffee maker after breaking the carafe of my old Krups machine. It makes very good coffee, looks great, and is simple to use. I ordered a Cuisinart gold filter to use with this pot and it fits pretty well where a paper filter would go. The carafe keeps my coffee hot for hours with no thermal plate. It is tall but has a (relatively) small footprint, great for my tiny kitchen.This is a great no-nonsense coffee maker at a moderately expensive price. It gives me what I wanted (thermal carafe, no warming plate, accepts gold-tone filters, insulated brewing), but if you're less picky, there are probably cheaper options."
4,thermal coffee maker,"I so far am pleased with this coffee maker. It is the first time I tried a thermal pot and it works great. I do not have to leave a pot on the hot plate to get stale, and the coffee does stay hot for about 3 hrs and is still quite warm at 4 hours, as the advertisement claimed."
2,Not Worth the Price,Bought this one as a gift for my parents Christmas 2008. It worked great until a couple of weeks ago when it just stopped working entirely. The warranty? 1 year. Product's lifespan? 18 months. I've had $20 Mr. Coffees last longer.
1,Well OURS DIDN'T WORK!,We had this coffee maker for 1 year whilst brewing coffee 2x a day and it simply refused to brew one morning and never again brewed. ALSO IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN 8 CUPS OF COFFEE IT OVERFLOWS ALL OVER THE PLACE CREATING A LIQUID MESS onto your countertop. Stick with Cuisinart or another well known brand that Macy's would carry.Not to mention this unit is poorly constructed and feels cheap.
3,Very pleased with the coffee. Not pleased with the stains the rubber pieces leave on my white counter.,"Makes very good coffee that's very hot (not sure what the other reviewer is complaining about there). However my review is more here as a warning to anyone that has white countertops (like the Corian ones) at home. This coffee maker has a non-skid bottom (for all those times your coffee maker goes flying off the counter, I guess?!?) that has these black rubber circles and if there is any water whatsoever under the machine which happens when you pour water in, it leaves little permanent circle marks all over my countertop. I've scrubbed with scouring powder and they've come off a bit, but not all the way. Oh well. So be warned if you have the same counters. Otherwise, I'd give it four stars."
1,Don't be duped!!,"Don't be duped by the 4-star rating, it's not reflective of this product at all. Here's why: 1) the brew pause function (to pour a cup while it's still brewing) does not work- it dripped coffee all over the plate each and every time I tried to do so; 2) the carafe is not well designed-coffee dripped down the side of it and my cup; and 3) the ""ON"" button stays lit after the brewing has finished, so monster-like sounds keep emanating from it well beyond brew time. (I had to push the ""OFF"" button a few minutes after the brewing had ended.) In all, a horrible product, especially with the steep price. For a point of reference, I am not a coffee snob like so many in these reviews. Also, I was replacing a six-year old Black & Decker coffee maker that had seen its last day, but had cost $39.99 originally."
1,Piece of Crap!,"Overpriced piece of crap. I bought it in April, only use it about 3 times a week. Stopped working in the first week of November about 7 months after the original purchase. Still searching for a good one, but this one is a dud!"
1,piece of crap,"The Zojiruchi Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker is a complete piece of crap. It overflows all overthe kitchen frequently. Sometimes one has forgotten to insert the separate filter holder, sometimes the works are clogged up but often enough it just does not make coffee. The carafe is good, but the coffee maker is garbage and I would seriously recommend that anybody seeking a carafecoffee maker buy something else. I have been using it for some months and am going to throw it in the garbage and get another."
2,Zojirushi EC-BD15,"The coffee maker looked very nice and was very quiet during operation. However, I was unhappy with the thermal carafe. It did not keep the coffee very hot. The bottom of the carafe seemed very thin and not insulated. Also, the lid was difficult to open. We had a coffee maker before with a thermal carafe that had a push button for pouring, was much easier to pour from. I ended up returning the coffee maker and purchased a different brand."
1,Broke after 2 months - Not worth the hassle,"This coffee maker is nothing special, the coffee tastes just the same as any of my other cups of coffee made with my Cuisinart (Thank God I didn't get rid of it!). After 2 months of service, it just stopped working and I knew I should've listened to the other post I read someone else with the same issue. Since the date of my return with Amazon ran out on the 3rd of October, I had to contact the company and now I have to ship it to one of their service centers. This is a lot of hassle for a coffee maker that I didn't even get that much use out of. Zojirushi should stick with making rice pots, because that is a great product and they make those very well. Coffee is not their forte!"
4,"Awesome brewer, until it broke","I have had this coffee pot for two years. It makes a fantastic brew and it works super fast. The programming function never failed me until this morning, when the element failed.The carafe is excellent, keeping the coffee hot for about 4 hours and warm for another 4-6. Clean up is easy.No complaints."
4,Great product,Easy to operate. Keeps coffee warm as advertised. Nice styling. Only problem is that the cap has to be loosened for the coffee to pour. I would recommend this product to a friend.
5,Great coffee!,"This is a great coffee maker. What else can I say? I own the 5-cup machine at home, which I love, so when I needed a replacement for the office, the Zoji was the obvious choice. The thermal carafe means I can make a pot for the ealy-shift, and the late-shifters are not getting burned coffee. To the reviewer who's only complaint was temperature loss, warm the carafe with hot water before brewing - just don't forget to pour it out! Now my only problem is training my neanderthals to re-close the carafe lid so everyone gets a hot cup!"
2,"Cheap, Disappointing and Mailing It Back","After doing extensive research on a thermos style coffee pot, I bought this. I am not sure how this thing has gotten so many good reviews. We have a Zojirushi bread maker that we love dearly but this is a piece of junk. I don't recommend buying this, especially at this price. It may not break, but it feels like it will and is poorly designed."
1,#4 Cone Coffee Filter Issue,"I have not purchased this product, so the 1 star has no meaning, but I do use #4 Melitta Coffee filters in my current coffee maker.What I do with the filters (and what the box instructs you to do)is to fold the bottom edge up and fold the side edge over on the filter before use.If the other folks who purchased this product are not folding their filters, this may cause the problem of the filter being too high for this coffee maker."
1,a Bust,We would not recommend this coffee maker. We purchased it in April of 2011. I worked OK until March of 2012 and then it ceased to function. We could find no way to check the wiring or find any fuses. When plugged in the clock kept time but the on switch did not work. We have now replaced it with a different brand.
5,Excellent... So Far,"I have been in search of the perfect coffee maker with a thermal carafe. This promised to be, but some of the reviews talked about problems that developed over time. I cannot yet speak to long term usage, but in the short term, it's great. Coffee taste was as good as any coffee maker I've had and it stays hot for hours (with no need to ""pre-heat"" the carafe).So, so far I love it."
4,Great coffee maker,It makes good coffee and it's easy to program to clean and the thermal container really keep it warm for hours like it says. I suggest not to grind your coffee too fine will make better taste coffee.
1,cold coffee anyone?,"All I was looking for was a good cup of HOT coffee, read the reviews till I turned blue..this had to be the one! Well, it's not, and the coffee is barely warm right after brewing...what a waste!"
4,Does the trick,"After going through two Cuisinart coffee makers in less than two years, I decided I needed a change and picked this one because of its simplicity and it's thermal carafe. It is all it says it is and makes decent coffee, but have two minor issues with this model. First when you place the carafe under the basket you have to be very careful that it is lined up properly before hitting the start button. You need to visually be sure it is lined up or the coffee can not flow into the pot and thus will overflow all over the counter. Second, make sure you don't fill above the 10 cup mark. Filling up to the reservoir overflow is too much water and the carafe will overflow."
4,Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker,"I like the thermal carafe, last cup is as good as the first. I have used subject appliance daily for about 4 weeks without problem or mishap. Amazon had the best price for this appliance and delivery was faster than expected. Most of the reviews, read prior to purchase, praised the Zojirushi EC-BD15 for brewing a superior tasting cup of coffee. On a first cup basis I cannot detect much difference over what I was able to brew with my old Mr. Coffee, a less expensive appliance."
4,great tasting coffee,This item lost 1 star due to small things but I couldn't give it 1/2 of a star. First the coffee maker was delivered in record time without ordering the faster rate. Makes good coffee which stays hot for a long time (being in the 100+ temp these days may help). Complaints: the cap that fits over the pot when it is done broke the second time I used it. The stem came off. To be fair I called them & they said they would send a new one out. Have not recieved it yet. The second thing is the rubber pads on the bottom come out if I slide it across the counter. Since it is so tall I usually have it out while it is brewing so the underside of the cabinets does not get the moisture. I have found it necessary to lift it up which is a bit of a hassle but doable. Otherwise I am completely happy with it. Used it on the auto mode & when I came home from my walk it was just finishing perking so had a nice hot cup of coffee to unwind with.
1,Dead after 5 months.,This was only used on weekends mostly and it still died after only 5 months of having it. Just stopped working one day. I had to go back to my trusty $20 Mr. Coffee.
2,"Sleek look, but overpriced and mediocre performance","Coffee is not as hot as promised by other reviews, carafe is somewhat flimsy and loses heat, and item is clearly overpriced for its quality.Also, unless carafe is left until it is finished brewing down to the last drop, coffee will drip onto the platform.All in all, not recommended."
3,"Not bad, but not what I had hoped for...","On the plus side, this coffee maker is easy to use, and makes fairly good coffee. The coffee stays fresh tasting longer than that from other drip coffee makers. However, the carafe does not keep coffee hot for as long as I had hoped it would. After a few hours, the coffee is only tepid. Additionally, we had a problem with the bottom half of the carafe separating from the top half. Apparently the seal had broken, and it will not stay together. I don't think that I would purchase this coffee maker again, unless the aforementioned problems had been corrected."
3,Stopped working after 6 months,makes acceptable coffee when it works. The cap for the carafe is a poor design and is easily lost as it has no place to store when coffee is brewing. Stopped brewing at only six months. Contacted company but no weekend support so will update when if hear back.
2,Maybe I had a defective one?,"I really like the style and ease of use of this coffee maker and I REALLY liked the quality of the cup of coffee it brewed. Unfortunately, anytime I set the timer for delayed brewing about a third or more of the water would leak out of the bottom of the unit all over the counter. I returned the product and was afraid to try again given some of the other problems noted by people on this site."
1,Buy something else,"It does make great coffee. Which is fine if you like slurping it off the counter. My unit leaks from the bottom sometimes. The ""sneak a cup"" mechanism jams open easily and jams closed sometimes as well. Both result in a mess. The carafe lid sometimes does not allow coffee to flow into the pot and it spills all over the place. I ended up having to remove the ""sneak a cup"" mechanism entirely and brew with the lid off to prevent spilling 3 cups of coffee on my countertops everyday. For the price this costs these flaws are simply unacceptable."
1,Weak Coffee Problem,There are Quality control problems with this maker. The coffee made started off medium strength (at best) and is now rapidly moving towards brown water. I have had the maker ~ 1 week. The filters don't fit the basket and the carafe has a weird slow pour spout that is irritating. Apparently they are not made in Japan. It will be returned. Pass on this.
1,Great IF/WHEN it works,"My Zojirushi coffee maker stopped working yesterday. I bought it 11/12/08 from Amazon -- that's less than 3 months. It simply will not brew although the ON button is pressed. I am going to try taking it to a service center. There are many reviews that say this same thing happened -- this machine has a problem. But when it works, it brews quickly and the coffee stays very hot in the carafe. We just haven't had coffee for 2 days now. :-("
3,"So disappointed, lasted 4 months only.","I really really liked this coffee maker. I bought it February 1 2010. On May 10 2010 the coffee maker's heating element must have quit. The clock and timer is working, but it no longer makes coffee. It comes on, but just sits there. I am so disappointed. I don't think it's worth the money to pay to ship it back for warranty repair. Looking for another coffee maker now.Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker"
2,Not Great Tasting Coffee,The machine is nice looking but the biggest issue is that the coffee does not come out very hot after brewing.... which I believe is why it does not taste very flavorful. I bought this based on the reviews but only a few of the many reviews point this out. I missed it when I was buying this but I have to tell the true coffee lovers out there that this is not the coffee maker for you. This arrived yesterday and I plan on returning it tomorrow.
2,"Worked great for awhile,,,",I was happy with this coffeemaker but at 8 months old it's not heating the water properly so the coffee is lukewarm. It's still under warranty but I'm sure it will be a hassle dealing with this. Wish me luck. I expected this to last for many years not months.
1,Wanted to like it...,"Nice machine, good sized carafe, good tasting coffee (when it works), but the darned thing overflows like crazy. We like strong coffee, and on weekdays we like to make a full pot, but apparently the water gets pumped into the grounds faster than it drips into the pot when there is a lot of coffee in the filter. We were not a good match, so it's going to be donated to charity."
5,Works Great,I have had this coffee maker for like two years it consistently makes good coffee for me every day. Do yourself a favor and fresh grind your beans too.
4,Works like expected,"Generally, I'm happy. The unit is lighter, less substantial than expected, soft plastic mostly. I like having a stainless carafe. Carafe comes with a plastic top that you optionally can place on the carafe to cover the holes used during brewing. Sadly the cap will allow you to place the carafe with holes covered back in the brewer opening making a coffee spillover certain on the next brew. I hid the cover to not do that again.Unit snorts a fair amount during brewing, so it's not quiet especially at the end.All in all the price is right, it looks good on the counter. It's tall but fits under our cabinets."
1,Basket Overflows and Floods Counter,"We purchased the Zojirushi Coffee Maker in June 2009. It makes good coffee but we've a recurring problem with the basket overflowing during the brew cycle and literally flooding the countertop. We've tried multiple brands of paper filters, different grinds of coffee, all to no avail. The only sure method is to babysit and turn the unit off manually when the basket is draining into the pot more slowly than hot water is going into the basket. Totally defeats the purpose of an ""automatic"" coffee maker. I've submitted a request to Zojirushi customer service to see if our unit may be defective, but I am pretty much ready to ditch it for something that actually works.Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker"
3,Improper Brew Temperature,"Starting with 10 cups of room temperature water, the machine initially dispensed hot water at 185 degrees, with the temperature climbing slowly throughout the cycle. However, it didn't hit the optimal range (195-200 degrees) until the very last cup. Another commenter remarked about how routing the hot water feed through the cold water reservoir was a poor design because it tended to chill the just heated water; I guess this explains the better performance as the water level dropped. I tried heating the water to 100 degrees before pouring it into the reservoir, but this had negligible effect.I plan on returning this unit. (Honestly, how hard can it be to heat water to the proper temperature?)"
4,Very Good Coffee Maker Even After Over 2 Years,"I've had this coffee maker for over 2 years and I thought it was time to review it (since I value reviews that aren't just initial impressions). I've had no problems during the time I've owned it. I really like this coffee maker - makes delicious coffee. The coffee is hot but not scalding, and stays hot for a long time. There really is no problem with the filter size as some have noted - a #4 filter is fine. The one drawback is that it is so tall that it does not fit under our upper cabinets (in our new house, it did in our prior house)."
2,Only worked under a year and a half,"I bought this April 08 and remember being disappointed when I pulled it out of the box because it felt so flimsy with cheap thin plastic. I thought we would give it a try, and it did make excellent tasting coffee. Kept it hot enough for me for 2 hours (which is about the same for all the coffee makers like this). The lid was very annoying, and often could not be turned open without using a gripper, and you have to take off and put on the top piece each time you brew coffee instead of the lid being one piece. Then one day it just wouldn't brew coffee anymore. For the price of this pot I would have thought it should have lasted longer and while I enjoyed the taste of the coffee, I don't think I can trust the quality of this coffee maker again. There should be a section for people to write reviews 2 years later so you know if the products really keep working or not instead of people writing reviews just right out of the box."
5,Zojirushi EC-BD15 coffee maker,"It is durable, easy to use. Uses less electricty to keep coffee warm by not using a warming plate. And very easy to clean and make the coffee."
2,"Loved it, but it died after 3.5 months","I really liked the coffee, the size, and the features. But the maker died suddenly this weekend, 3.5 months after purchase. It would not start brewing although the lights indicated power.UPDATE: I bought a replacement, and the replacement died in the same way 7 months after purchase. Very disappointing."
2,As temperamental as a maiden aunt with the vapors,"Makes good coffee, when you can get it to cooperate. The carafe must be placed rather precisely under the valve that lets the coffee flow from the filter; get this wrong and the machine barfs coffee + grounds all over itself and your counter. The device requires a level of accurate aim of which I am incapable in the mornings before I've had my coffee.Also, the little swing arm which drizzles the water from the reservoir into the filter does not reliably swing into place when you close the lid. And finally, it's very easy to hit the wrong button when trying to set the Auto brew feature, and to bump the time set buttons when you're just trying to turn the thing on. Nice form factor, good coffee but an altogether poor design. I would never buy this again."
2,Made in China junk!,"Had the exact same coffee maker for about 3 years and had no complaints until one day it just stopped working. I bought this carafe off of Amazon 5 months ago and experienced the exact same problem today. The coffee pot heated up, brewed about 1/3 of a pot and then just stopped. After I cleaned it thoroughly I tried again and the water would not heat up and it didn't pump water. Luckily I can return to the company for warranty repair (at my own cost for shipping). But Zojirushi needs to bring their manufacturing back to Japan and the US and STOP exporting Chinese junk!!! Coffee is great when it works and the Zojirushi products I have bought that are manufactured in Japan are top notch!"
2,frustrated,"I was impressed with the flavor this coffee maker produces, but very frustrated with the carafe not keeping the coffee hot. It is also IMPOSSIBLE to loosen the lid after brewing to pour a cup!!!! I had read other reviews, but thought it was surely not so bad. WRONG! I really wish I had paid attention more to the comments about the lid. Very frustrating. Wish I had paid more for a coffee maker that brewed to the right temperature:("
1,Doesn't last!!,"After extensive research, we bought this coffee pot in December 2009. Today, the buttons on the machine pushed in and would not pop out. After partially disassembling the machine, we found that plastic parts were broken inside of the machine. After only a year and a half of use, the coffee maker is unusable. After this experience, I would not recommend purchasing this model unless you don't mind replacing your appliances frequently!"
1,Do not buy this product,"Bought it, used it for 2 1/2 months then it died. It was beyond the return date for amazon and customer service for zojirushi is awful. I would not purchase it, not reliable."
2,below average coffee maker,It is a below average coffeemaker coffee tastes worse than my old maker the carafe only keeps the coffee hotb for a while not like i expected. cheaply made plastic machine
5,Whole bean grinder,The best coffee maker we have ever owned. Would like to see a coffee bean grinder included in future issues.
4,Great machine,Others wrote that getting the lid off was difficult. This was true at first but got better with time. Easy to clean.
2,didn't last a month,"Made descent coffee, carafe is nice, nice looking and work fine till it died. Got to replace Bunn HG that I need to send back every two or three months because they keep dieing. Well time to pull the Bunn out of the box again and look for something else before this one gives up the ghost and I have to send it back to Bunn for the forth time."
1,Lasted only two months!,"After only a couple of months it has quit working! Paid a lot of money for this unit, so buyer beware! It quits brewing and I have to repeatedly push the 'on' button to get it to make coffee. Not worth it! I went back to my old inexpensive maker. You should seriously consider this before buying this item!!! Not worth the money!!!!!"
4,Zojirushi Coffee Maker,Great Coffee Maker. Brews quickly. Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours. No burned coffee from a glass pot on a hot burner.
4,Grat Product,Great product. I will agree that the opening and closing of the product could use a little work. Keeps coffee just the way I like it! Steaming hot.
4,Good item,"Ordered this after reading reviews on this brand and several others. Also checked other appliances made by this manufacturer. We wanted a thermal pot. It makes good coffee, but the thermal carafe does need to be preheated before brewing. It doesn't hold temperature as well as expected (especially as compared to our Thermos brand coffee mugs) but it's still much better than a coffee maker with a heated plate, which cooks coffee. And Japanese companies make quality merchandise, so expect it will hold up well."
3,Keeping it Warm,"Compared to a Krups Thermal pot, this keeps the coffee warmer for a longer time. There are multiple parts to the top of the carafe, though, which makes for interesting mornings if you aren't fully awake."
2,Weak Coffee,"Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee MakerI am a fairly serious coffee drinker who roasts my own coffee. I currently have a Braun Flavorselect drip coffee maker with a glass carafe and wanted a drip maker with a thermal carafe. After reading the reviews on the Fresh Brew, I purchased it mainly because it was supposed to brew at the ideal 200F temperature. I brewed two pure water runs to clean out the unit and had no problems with leakage. I checked the water running through the basket with a digital thermometer and it read 180F which was discouraging. I then brewed 6 cups of Brazil Coromandel-Fazena Sao Joao. The taste lacked the complexity I got with the Braun and lacked body. The brew water was about 170F. I will be looking for a new home for this coffee maker."
2,"Adequate, with some serious problems","The coffee maker works well enough, but it has too many problems for a unit of this price level:1. The coffee isn't all that hot to begin with and cools rapidly in the supposedly thermal carafe. If you don't plan to drink it all within a half hour or so, you will need a separate, more effective, carafe to keep it in.2. If you do keep it in the stainless steel carafe, you're supposed to use a separate lid to plug the inflow hole. That's an additional component that is easy to misplace. Once you lose it, you're sunk.3. The lid sticks very tightly after the coffee is made, and it has no easy handhold. You can either make your hand bloody trying to open it, or find a dish towel to provide some cushioning. And you have to be pretty strong to get it open.I will use this maker until it needs replacement because having paid for it, I don't want to just discard it. But I would not buy another one, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
1,Doesn't work after less than 6 months,"This coffeemaker made made okay coffee but burnt out after less than six months of use. I contacted the manufacturer. The representative informed me that I would have to ship the coffeemaker to one of their approved repair centers for repair. I stated that this was unacceptable and I wanted a new coffeemaker. No dice. The most they would offer was free shipping to the repair center. In my opinion, a coffeemaker that stops working after less than six months is defective and needs to be replaced, not repaired. Therefore, I'm sending it back to Amazon in hopes of getting a partial refund. I also thought that the coffeemaker was kind of basic for the price, but I thought I was getting a really good appliance that would last a while. What a joke."
5,Zojirushi coffee maker--Ec-BD1BA,The coffee maker arrived early! I immediately made a pot of coffee. The maker made the coffee FAST. The coffee was perfect!! It was HOT and smooth--hotter and much smoother than coffee made by our older pot. The older pot was a different make--the coffee was the same brand I have been using. Operating the coffee maker and carafe (opening the top) was easy.
4,Be Patient,"Yes, it is true the lid is sometimes hard to open.Fix: use a towel to turn it with slight upward pressure.Plus: the coffee stay HOT for hours.ANDYes, the filter size is in between a #2 and #4Fix: cut the larger (#4) to fit.Plus: you get to practice patience.The coffee maker is quiet, fast and brews coffeee that stays hot for hours. If patience is not one of your virtues, look at this as a growing opportunity where your reward is a great cup of coffee."
5,Typical Japaneese Quality,"Got this unit in Sept after extensive research. Makes a good-great cup of very hot coffee, and stays drinkable hot for about 2 hours. FOR THE $$$$$, its the best buy in coffee makers-Technivorm and Capresso, probably makes the absolute best-but they're pricy and may not be worth it.Couple of tips make great coffee in this machine:1-Use filtered, luke-warm water-no COLD. Brew temp of my Zoji is 196 degrees-in the perfect zone. Using cold water it came down to 189, was like drinking sludge.2-You can use regular cone filters, just make sure they're patted down inside the basket3-Make sure the shower sprayer head is over the bed of coffee and NOT pouring in between the filter and the basket-1 big messThe carafe is easy to clean, the buttons are easy to set for morning brew and the quality is like that of a Toyota compared to some, um, uh inferior models. Buy one, you won't be dissapointed."
1,Piece of Junk,"I brought this with high hopes but it just stopped working. It is nothing more than one of those $10 coffee makers you buy at Big Lots. Besides it not working only after 6 months of rare usage, the coffee does not stay hot very long and really doesn't taste any different than a cheap brewer. I am truly sorry I brought this!"
3,Good product. Quickly broke. Repair only no replacement.,"Coffe maker was used for just under 2 months before it stopped working. Company would only repair, not replace, even under warranty. Meaning, we would be without morning coffee for several weeks while shipping two ways for repairs. Purchase this item with caution."
3,True what they say...,"All the things I read about it is it brews good coffee but its not very hot. This is very true. It works well, it is easy to use, but the coffee does not come out that hot. It comes out drinkable but by the time you get to the last sip it is warm at best. The thermal pot is great it keeps the coffee ""hot"" for hours. I found the best way to make the coffee a little hotter was to boil water then pour it in the pot to warm it up... then brew the coffee in the hot pot. That seemed to help but its still not very hot. Other than that it works great and its a nice design."
2,"Makes a good cup of coffee, BUT...","I was disappointed after spending $90.00 for this coffee machine. Cons: It is cheaply made, no insulation, very loud, and no water filter. Now the thing that makes me most crazy is the screw down cap on the carafe, it is extremely hard to open after you brew the coffee because the heat from the coffee distorts the cap,, making it next to impossible to unscrew to get your first cup of coffee. The cap has a thin edge with small bumps to grip, very bad design. It slowly gets easier as the coffee looses it heat. Pros: The water comes out at 200 degrees which is a good thing for making a great cup of coffee. The coffee stays hot for a long time like 5hrs. If you don't mind all the negatives than this is the coffee machine for you."
4,Great maker for the price,"This is a great coffee maker for someone looking to spend under $100. I thoroughly researched coffee makers in this price range and settled on this one despite the negative reviews.1. This maker is easy to use and easy to clean.2. The lid on the thermos is hard to twist if you tighten it too much. Simple solution: don't tighten it that much.3. The carafe is excellent and keeps coffee piping hot for two hours; it is still hot enough to drink without microwaving four hours later.4. The design ensures that the coffee never sees the light of day as it is brewing, so your coffee remains hot.5. I'm not sure what temperature this brews at, but it seems to be hotter than other machines I've tried in the price range.In all, this is a good coffee maker for the price."
2,Great while it worked,"Worked great for 1 week, then it just quit. Wouldn't brew for anything after 5 days of use. Really nice looking, and made great coffee when it did work, but for some reason it didn't last. We did use hot filtered water in response to some of the other reviews here that said that it didn't stay warm long enough."
4,Great coffeemaker.,"This is a very nice coffee maker. Seems to be well built, too. I enjoy having an insulated carafe; you can carry it around the house, onto the porch, etc. and have hot coffee for hours (it does keep coffee hot for hours, especially if it's fairly full). The coffee stays pretty fresh, too, rather than acquiring a burnt flavor. The brew temperature of the coffee is also excellent... I measured it with an accurate thermometer at around 190F at first; the temperature increases to around 200F for the later stages of the brewing process. Coffee becomes appropriately foamy when brewing, similar to using a pour-over filter or a French press, which I think indicates that the brew extraction is excellent.This coffee maker also has a convenient timer setting for those early morning when the caffeine is more important than the taste."
4,Decent coffee maker for the price,"Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker:Purchased this coffee maker about a month ago to replace a similar Cuisinart product. Here are our findings.Having compared both the Zojirushi and Cuisinart they both get the job done in terms of the task of coffee making. I am no coffee aficionado, but the taste difference in the coffee is negligible to me.Overall, the compare similarly. However...- while form factor of the Zojirushi is a bit smaller and more elegant- the Cuisinart with glass lined carafe keeps coffee ""hotter"" longer.- Moreover the Cuisinart also has a alarm the notifies you when the brew cycle is done.- Both are the same to program"
4,"Works well, makes a good cup of coffee","I have been using the Zojirushi for a little over one month and am pleased with my purchase. It brews quickly and efficiently, uses standard #4 cone filters, and is simple to use. The carafe keeps the coffee warm for a long time. It does not leak, unlike my Krups which leaked from day one. It fits nicely on the countertop and does not appear obtrusive due to its sleek design. Overall, I am very pleased. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the way the top is designed. You have to pull the entire coffee maker out from under the top cabinets (if you have it placed under cabinets) in order to place the filter, coffee, and water. So, that is a minor inconvenience prohibiting a perfect rating."
2,Good hot coffee but reliability issues.,"The first worked great. Nice, hot, good tasting coffee. But the 10's unit on the display stop working on the 3rd day. It made it difficult to set the time. Amazon promptly sent a replacement unit. The 2nd unit had a slow leak. The first morning I found approximately 1 cup of water had leaked before it started brewing. It was very evident that it was coming from inside the unit not an accidental spill. I had high hopes for the unit from all the user reviews. It did make a good cup of coffee but I can't put my faith in a brand that became defective within days. I will look for a different brand."
5,Perfect Coffee Maker and Carafe in one,"I have always used Carafe's so after my last one cracked I was looking for a new one and I found it. I have made coffee in this many times and the coffee comes out perfect everytime. I put warm water in it to start with and rinse the carafe with hot water so it will get a good start on being hot. I bought the Medelco #4 Cone Permanent Coffee Filter to go with this pot and it fits perfectly, my #4 paper cone filters also fit this.The filter/coffee holder comes off on this pot so it is very easy to clean and it is also very easy to use. This pot looks very nice and goes great with my stainless steel appliances so I don't have to find a cabinet for it, I can just leave it out on the counter.Not sure why all the negative reviews but I LOVE this coffee pot!"
3,Zojirushi EC-BD15 Died after 28 months,"This is an excellent coffee maker, so much so that we are about to order another. Thats because, our first just died, and although the timer and clock work fine, it will no longer brew. I hope that our next will last a bit longer, but at least we will have a second carafe that is compatible. This coffee maker does make excellent coffee and that is the primary reason that we are getting another."
4,It Does the job.,"I wanted to take the time to write a short review on this coffee machine. I was hesitant at first, buying a Japanese coffemaker, especially being Italian, but it seemed that if I wanted a quality thermal carafe at a decent price this was the product to buy. I've had it for a month and I must say along with the gold filter I bought with it, it is making a very good cup of coffee. Currently I'm brewing the Whole Foods Rainforest Blend. The coffee stays hot for at least 3 hours and stays warm for the whole day. It defineitely keeps the coffee fresh much longer than conventional carafes. I also like it because it's very fast, so in case I don't want to program it, I can still have my coffee ready within 2 or 3 minutes.The only thing I would change about it is that I would still have a warming plate at the base of the machine or a separate warming plate to plug in at the table. Otherwise it does the job it's supposed to do, which is a lot more than I can say for most products nowadays."
4,Zojirushi Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker,Good tasting coffee is reliably produced. Thermal carafe pours well and is easy to use. Flavor not quite as good as with the Newco OCS but hopefully the Zoji will hold up longer than the Newco that died after a year and a half.
4,Would recommend this product!,"We have enjoyed our Zojirushi Carafe Coffee Maker! It is a great looking machine and fits great under our cabinets! It does great at keeping the coffee very warm to drink throughout the morning! The only complaints we've had is that when the warming cap is on the carafe, it's difficult to get it under the base of the pot. And the little red ball in the cup-measuring part, gets stuck and doesn't show you how many cups of water you're putting in! But - overall we like the product and the price and would recommend it to others!!"
2,nothing great,"This product brews an ok cup of coffee. The only problem, and it is a big one, is that it often overflows. If the pot is not placed correctly, the brew cycle continues and brews onto the counters and floor. I have woken up to this mess a few times to many and am fed up. Time to look for a better brewer. I was dissapointed in the quality for the price. I bought it because I own the Zojirushi rice cooker and other wonderful products by them. The coffee maker is not one I would reccomend."
2,"Nice coffee, but hard to get to","This is a nice coffee maker. The coffee that it produces tastes good and it keeps the coffee hot for a long time. I have only two complaints.1. The lid is very hard to open if it is closed tightly. This is because there is a very small area to grasp on the lid. The lid needs to be improved in future models.2. The pot will drip almost every time you pour a cup of coffee.Other than those two items, this is a good coffee maker."
4,Best coffee maker,"I love this coffee maker. The unit lasts for a very long time, no problems, brews great coffee keeps the coffee warm and is a terrific product."
5,Great Product,Works great and keeps coffee hot for hours. Only problems we have had were our own fault. I made one improvement in the lid. It has a black dot that is hard to see on the edge of the lid. You line up the dot with the pour spout to open the pot so you can pour. Took a round file and filed a notch in the edge of the lid next to the spot. Much easier to line it up with the spout now.Our unit just failed today but we are ordering another just like it. The first one was used at least twice a day for 3+ years. It earned it's keep!
3,New Coffee Pot,"The coffee maker is nice to look at, it brews the coffee so that it is hot, but the pot doesn't hold the heat as good as I think it should. The top is very difficult to open and the little nubs on it (which I assume are there so you can get a grip on it) actually hurt my hand. The brew is good. It is an ok coffeemaker."
2,Not my cup of...coffee,"I read the reviews of this coffee maker not knowing the brand at all. The reviews were very positive, so I decided to give it a try, but was very unhappy with its design. First, it is much taller than most makers and barely fits under kitchen cabinets. Second, the coffee filter area is tight and does not fit most cone filters. This crunches the top of the paper cone leaving grounds in the holder (more cleaning required after each use). Third, it is true the controls are poorly placed on the right side of the maker (why, I do not know). This makes it very difficult to start and program without moving it from a good location on the counter. Fourth, the carafe top is in three parts which I am sure I will loose the top cover had I kept this maker in my home.So, as you can tell I returned this item due to its poor design and I am still searching for a suitable replacement."
2,Unhappy customer,We purchased this coffee maker because of the reviews. I will be more cautious in the future. We had a Delonghi coffee maker and were very happy with it until the carafe broke. Did some research and purchased this one. The cap to the coffee maker holds water that you can't even get out without shaking it vigorously. I contacted the company and they kept sending me replacement caps. They all did the same thing. I even drilled holes in it for more drainage but it didn't help. Will buy something else the next time.
1,Very disappointed,"I'm a fan of Zojirushi products, but it was my first experience with its coffee maker, and my high expectation was dashed by the quality of its brewed coffee, which tastes like water, even with extra coffee grounds put in. I'd exhort Zojirushi to fix the design of this machine, to deliver higher-temperature water. The design is beautiful and elegant, but alas I cannot drink the design, so am returning this product with regret, and sticking with my current favorite, the KitchenAid coffee machine (KCM222CU)."
2,Poorly Engineered Carafe and Clogs,1. Coffee carafe lid poorly engineered and clogs if coffee grounds overflow filter basket. This happened on three occasions including course ground coffee as instructed by manual. Due to the poor engineering of carafe lid the unit cannot be used unattended. (Coffee flows all over the counter) This is a critical part of the unit design for timed auto start.2. Carafe spout design pours very slowly and prompts the user to open it further that results in the lid coming off and spilling the coffee.Returned the unit and went back to Consumer Reports for recommendations.
1,Buy Something Else,"Had high hopes for this but what a let down. Coffee is drinkable right after brewing. Not hot. The thermal pot holds ""warm"" coffee for about 2 hours. My old(15 years) Krups thermal pot's coffee was almost too hot to touch after 5-6 hours in the pot. Will start looking again for another replacement. It could be I got a bad one but still disappointed in the brand."
2,Cheaply made and poor design,The bad:. The pad the thermos sits on is thin plastic and is already cracked.. It has this movable plastic spout for delivering the hot water to the coffee which is bound to break.. The shiny thin black plastic scratches easilyThe good:. Makes good coffee. Clock and timer very easy to setup. Thermos is light and seems to insulate wellOverall it seems very cheaply made and I doubt it will last as long as my precious Krups had.
1,disappointed,"The coffeemaker was defective, BUT, even if it hadn't been, I was totally unimpressed with the quality. I'm not sure where they get off charging so much for this thing...it's actually not even as well made as a Proctor-Silex or other more popular, less expensive brand."
1,heating element broke twice,"I did a lot of research before buying this product. I wanted a carafe so we could keep the coffee warm without using extra electricity or burning the coffee. Don't buy this one. The heating element broke within a week of use. I sent it back, got a new one, and it did the same thing. It's not an electrical issue, the clock still worked. It just would not make coffee anymore."
1,Broke after 1 day! NO KIDDING!!,"Like many unhappy buyers of this coffee pot, I did substantial research before I bought this maker (I bought a Zojirushi Rice cooker before; and that was super). I was totally shocked to find out the timer and the power went out of order after only 1 day's usage!! None of the buttons worked. I tweaked and tried different electrical outlets in the house without success. The carafe looks good, but the whole machine is useless nonetheless :-( Unfortunately, the machine was bought 3 yrs ago; only I waited 3 years to use it. So the warranty expired a long time ago. What a huge disappointment!! What a waste!!"
5,Excellent coffee maker!,This coffeemaker makes excellent coffee in a few short minutes. The carafe keeps coffee hot for many hours. It is easy to use and is the best coffeemaker I have had.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Coffee was not as warm as expected. Even fresh cups of coffee must be heated in the microwave. No adjustment for strength, and coffee seems somewhat weak. Should have gone with the Cuisinart."
4,Worth it,"Love the automatic brew setting and the carafe which I take to work with me and the coffee stays hot for hours. I agree with the reviewer who had a hard time opening the lid- that feature could be improved. Looks nice on the counter, cleans up well, brews up a tasty pot of coffee. I probably would not have spent this much money on a coffee maker made in China had I known but here it is and I really like it so I hope it lasts a long time."
5,"Great coffee maker, great coffee","I read all the reviews and ordered this one with trepidation. It came out of the box and after the first rinsing brew, I loaded it up with some joe. I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use. We've had it now over a month and I can honestly say we'll never go back to glass carafe. There are no bugs with this very simple machine so far. It does not appear to have a lot of parts that would go bad."
3,Coffee maker,We like the coffeemaker fine. None of the problems in the reviews we read are really that problematic. I was surprised that the coffeemaker itself is made of pretty light-weight plastic. It doesn't have the quality feel that my Barista or the Cusinart coffeemakers have. Only time will tell whether it will hold up to the others. The coffee is fine though. I don't love the lid with plastic topper but can live with it. I would still prefer to have a Barista like my last coffeemaker if they were still making them. It was awesome.
4,excellent product,"Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee MakerI ordered this product after seeing both good and not so good reviews, the good outweighed the bad. I have been extremely pleased with the coffee maker, the coffee stays hot for a long time, warm after 6 or 7 hours, and the automatic timer allows me to have hot coffee waiting for me when I wake up. It is easy to clean and program. I would recommend this product to anyone. Jane G"
4,Zojirushi Coffee Brewer,I am very pleased with the coffee maker and especially like tha I can program it and have coffee ready when I arise in the morning.
4,Excellent Coffee Maker,I bought 3 of these coffee makers over a year ago and all have worked excellent.....two of them are used daily. Coffee has very good taste and very hot....carafe will keep it hot but you can't expect it to be as hot as when it is first brewed. We have had many different coffee makers and this one is by far the best we have had. For the money you can't go wrong.
1,Worst Coffee Maker,"I just called customer service about the overflow issue with this coffee maker. It is unreliable and consistantly overflows - making a mess of your countertops and and drawers near it. Zojirushi first commented that they had never heard of this problem - even though it is posted all over the web. Then they changed their tune, and asked me if I was grinding my own beans - as that could be causing the problem. I brought to their attention, that if this machine could not handle fresh ground coffee, it should be advertised as such. I am throwing this machine in the garbage - where it belongs, as I do not have the time in my morning to watch my coffee brew, and jump up and pull the plug when it starts overflowing. Zojirushi needs to step up to the plate, acknowledge they have a design flaw, and refund any monies spent on this useless product."
2,Spill Spill Spill,"This COULD have been a good coffee maker. The coffee stays hot in the stylish metal carafe. And it tastes good too. BUT - - - oh my goodness, how many times have we had to clean up an ""overflow"" spill. So many!!!!!! No reason for this to happen. Even when we minimize the water and coffee amounts - spills aplenty. Not good."
1,Big Disappointment,"One of the biggest disappointments in a coffee maker purchase that I've ever made....it's poorly designed, cheaply constructed, coffee never seems piping hot and just doesn't brew a good cuppa jo....should have returned it but just never got around to doing so. I would highly UNrecommend it."
1,Not hot enough,"I was really hoping for the best with this item, but it is not to be. This coffee maker only reaches the optimal brew temp of 195-205 degrees for the last 2-3 cups of water. The first 7-8 cups brew around 180-185 degrees. I even tried pre-heating the water on stove to 100+ degrees before pouring it in and brewing, and it still can't brew higher than 185 for the first 7 or 8 cups. Might have to spend the $300 on a Technivorm, or just use my $36 Northwest Glass Yama Stovetop Coffee Siphon for the best coffee we have ever had."
2,"Weak brew, bitter flavor, not hot enough","Had a Krups Aroma Control for about 7 years until the heating element broke. Bought this because of the positive reviews but was very disappointed in the quality of the coffee. Using the same amount of water and coffee as I did with the Krups, this unit brewed coffee that tasted bitter and weak. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the temperature is too low and when cold milk is added you wind up with a lukewarm cup of coffee. I'm returning this and purchasing the Krups Moka Brew which will hopefully make coffee similar to my old Krups unit."
2,Works great...poor taste,"I was very excited with my new coffee maker initially.Great features, easy to use, nice looking etc. I'm verydisappointed with the taste of the coffee. I spent a month trying different brands of coffee, various grinds and several different water/coffee combinations with no success. It basically makes a lousy tasting cup of coffee. Very little flavor and it has a ""bite"" to it. I'm very disappointedwith the flavor."
1,"Lame, lame, lame.","I think this machine is lame. It is not solid what-so-ever. The carafe is a joke - as my coffee is luke warm within two hours. A small piece of plastic (the ""lid"") you have to put on after brewing just does not cut it. The review that mentions it does not really take a ""4"" filter is right on...you have to be carful the hot water spout (not sure what that is called) is over the ground beans and does not get hung up on the ""4"" filter paper....or you have a mess on your hands. Maybe I got a lemon - but the water also does not saturate the beans, leaving part of them actually dry after the brewing cycle. Weak coffee and a waste of beans!This machine is NOT worth anywhere near the $80 - $90 price tag. I would rather have a $30 Target special Mr. Coffee at this point...no joke."
1,Worst coffeemaker I have ever owned,"I have owned several thermal carafe coffee makers. This is undoubtedly the worst. Several times it has forced the coffee grounds out of the filter, into the basket, and plugged the drip mechanism. It then spills al over the counter. The coffee is also not very hot and gets cold more quickly than any other thermal carafe coffee maker I've ever owned. This is going to the trash and I will replace it even though it's less than two years old."
3,Good for the Money,"Its a good purchase for the money. Looks are ok, main reason I bought this model. Carafe is sometimes a pain to open."
2,Dissapointed,Nice sleek design. Keeps coffee very hot--sometimes--if you don't rinse the carafe with hot hot water first then not so hot.Nice programable feature. Coffee just does not taste good. You must have a carafe with some sort of glass thermal inside.These type of coffee thermal pots give coffee a weird taste. Sorry I bought it!
4,Good value,I saw on Consumer Reports that this was the top rated thermal coffee maker under $100 so I bought it. After reading some of the reviews I was concerned. The top of the pot is a little difficult to unscrew but certainly not impossible. The filters don't fit perfectly but with a little care it is not a problem. I also own and use a Capresso at our cottage. It has none of these problems but is also $75 more expensive. So I traded some convenience for a cheaper price and am happy with the decision.
5,Excellent Coffee Maker,"Makes delicious tasting coffee; faster, and less expensive than those K & T cup gadgets! Very stylish and unique looking, nice conversation piece for the kitchen."
3,QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES,"I'll start off by saying that this unit makes very good coffee and keeps it hot most of the day. It would only be fair to acknowledge that.I wish Amazon allowed you to give a 3 1/2 star rating, because that is what this deserves.ISSUES: Had this about 5 years now. The top lid became slightly warped and no longer closes completely...not a big deal. Also, there is a see thru tube running from top to bottom with a little red ball inside. This is the water level indicator and it stopped working early on. The little red ball is permanently stuck on the bottom. This IS a big deal because I have no way of accurately knowing how much water is inside.Would I buy another? Probably...makes very good coffee and keeps it hot most of the day."
1,Worked great for 1 month only!,"This was a great coffee maker until it stopped working one month after I bought it. The water leaked out everywhere and there was no way to resolve the issue other than to return it. Amazon.com is the best and made the return a very painless transaction. I love Amazon but I am really disappointed in this Zojirushi coffee maker, it really let me down big time."
5,Good Value,"The Zojirushi Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker does everything that the product claims. I usually add coffee & set the brew timer the night before. If I sleep in late, the coffee is still hot. The thermal carafe does a great job. No complaints."
2,It's an OK coffee maker,"In terms of what it's used for I think it's good (not great). Some pros and cons:Pros:-It brews coffee really fast.-Thermal carafe is an excellent. keeps warm for long time.-Timer comes in very handyCons:-I had to exchange due to leak in the carafe lid and even the exchaned one is leaking too (not as bad as first one though). it's an internal leak where water/coffee sips into the lid whereI can't get it out. this is the reason for 2star.-Too tall. it barely fints under my kitchen cabinet (miner)-puring the water is not as good as other coffee makers I've used before. there is no way to measure water amout you are pouring unless you use measuring cup.Anyways, that's my review. if it was for lid leaking I would say it would get 3 stars but leaking lid is not acceptable, especially 2 in a row."
2,The Lid is Torture!,"I had this coffee maker for over a year and the lid was ALWAYS too difficult to untwist with your bare hands. I always had to use a towel or the rubber pad used to open cans. Many times I gave up and had to had my husband open it for me. The worst of it is, that is how it pours - you have to twist it to get your coffee out - no easy button to open the spout. We kept is so long because the coffee stays hot and delicious. However, life is just too short to keep an appliance that DAILY causes you strife. I wish I had returned it as it is quite pricey."
5,Hot,"This coffee pot is hot! It looks hot, the coffee's hot and it stays hot! It also makes a great cup of coffee. Love the timer, too. Husband loves it."
1,Breaks Too Easily,"I bought this item and didn't start using it until 9 months ago. After only two weeks, the automatic timer stopped working. Now, 8 months later, it stops brewing and to brew only 6 cups worth I have to press the on button 3 or 4 times, because it keeps switching off. Called Zojirushi and of course they said it was past the warranty date and insinuated that I was lying about the time it was actually used for (he said that paople say all kinds of things). Will never buy another Zojirushi product!!!"
5,BEST Coffeemaker ever! NOT Update,"I love this coffeemaker. I even gave up my Braun for it. It does everything and then some. Makes Great coffee, keeps it hot and is easy to operate and clean.UPDATE:After one year it stopped working (warranty gone) I called and they sent me a packet of something to clean it with. Didn't work. I pulled out the old Braun and I've been using it without problem ever since. It doesnt have the bells and whistles and doesn't keep the coffee hot. so I put the hot coffee into the Zojirushi carafe. OK, so at least I loved the carafe right? Today the bottom fell off the carafe.Looking for a new coffee maker and I think I'll go back to Braun."
2,Another Average Coffee Maker,"The first arrived with a water leak over the control panel and it was returned. The second works, but there's nothing special about it. Other machines keep the coffee hot as well and are not so difficult to open. The plastic is cheap too and you have to turn the machine to see water level and controls. I don't need an extra plastic piece to keep the coffee hot. Even using a gold platted filter (not gold tone) and freshly ground beans the results are the same as my reliable Braun. It's being returned to the vendor."
4,"Zoji Great Coffee, small problems","I bought My Zoji about 2 months ago, after a little effort, trial and error I love this pot!As others have mentioned, watch your fill temp, too cold and you get less than perfect coffee!also if you grind your own it is very nice!Watch how tight you put the lid on the carafe,if the pot is cold the lid can be very tough to get off once the vacuum happens! (cold pot gets hot)That is about the only thing I wish they would re-design, it is hard to get a really good grip on the lid and the vacuum action can make this much worse!Lesson, don't over tighten, in fact just barely snug seems good enough!"
2,couldn't work it,"I couldn't turn the lid which is vital when brewing and then serving. The plastic swelled up and wouldn't budge (the design is too flat I think). Also, the coffee wasn't too hot. Judy"
1,Worked Great...for a year,Bought this coffee maker one year and a month ago. Worked great for a year and actually bought one for my in-laws this past Christmas. Sorry I did now. Stopped working one month out of warranty. Impossible to get a response from mfg. Same problem other reviewers were having. A few days before it went out completely it would brew half a pot and stop. Love the thermal coffee maker idea now and will be buying one from a quality mfg.
1,Disappointing,"Contrary to it's claim, this coffeemaker will not accept a #4 filter. It is also very difficult to open and very difficult to center properly for the coffee to flow into the carafe. Also, the cap to the carafe has to be removed before making coffee. All of these drawbacks taken together make this one of the worst coffeemakers I have ever owned."
1,Not worth the money,I purchased this product after lots of research. I wanted a coffeemaker that brewed a hot cup of coffee into a insulated carafe. I was very disappointed on how cheaply this coffeemaker is made. It fell apart after only four uses. All plastic pieces. It did make hot coffee and the carafe kept it hot for several hours. I was so disappointed that I returned it.
1,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!!,"I am SO disappointed with this coffee maker!! I was really looking forward to getting this so when it showed up at 6:30pm I said I was making a pot! Taking it out of the box I found a cheap plastic machine, but didn't want to jump to any conclusions until the coffee was made. Well, I couldn't open the carafe to get the coffee out and it took me about 4-5 mins to drain the contents . I am really shocked at all the rave reviews that were listed for this maker. My FREE Gevalia maker makes this look like a Wal-Mart special! I'm going to be shaking my head on this one for some time."
2,Nice features . . . but just not HOT enough!,"We really wanted to like this product. We LOVE our Zoji Airpot, and when our beloved Bodum Electric Santos finally became too cruddy to look at anymore (it's just impossible to clean thoroughly) we were happy to see that Hammacher had rated this Zoji maker as a ""Best"" and that it had received good reviews here at Amazon. Sadly, however, it's one fatal flaw for us is that the coffee is just not hot enough -- even when freshly brewed into the carafe. We really tried to convince ourselves that it was our imagination, but it wasn't. So ... the pot went back and we've opted for the Cuisinart DCC-1200 in Black and Stainless Steel. Not QUITE as good a cup of coffee as the Bodum, but close . . . and hot!"
5,"Identifying the protagonist will fool most readers, at first","Steinberg does an excellent job of setting up a ""straw man"" protagonist (the female psychologist), then switching reader identification in an unexpected direction. A masterful device, worthy of this finely crafted novel. The unabridged audiotape version is particularly well done."
2,Awful,"Relatively little suspense; ridiculous characterizations, extremely unlikely plot. Steinberg's _Nobody's Safe_ shows he can write; this book just shows that he needed some more practice after he wrote it."
4,An engaging novel that is well worth your time,"I have to admit, I had some doubts about the book before I started reading it, but I ended up a fan.The first chapter or two was a little slow going but shortly after the book took off and didn't stop.I really liked the characters, especially Patricia (the main female character). The play that goes on between Patricia and Brian (the main character - who's as compelling and dark as Hanibal Lechter) is done very well.My favorite line from the book...""Nod for yes, die for no."" A perfectly twisted line.There are some really good characters here as well as a nicely driven plot.It's a good ride and well worth the read."
2,"Rather dull, very predictable","This was definitely not a book that you can look forward to reading. Once in a while it would catch you, but it was a very disappointing novel."
2,Action happens late,I think Mr. Stienberg could have done a better job with this book. Grant it Brian Newman was a complex character.Brian Newman could have escaped a little earlyer in the book.If Brian Newman escaped earlyer he could have played some major games with his captors.Especially Patrica Newlly. Also I think Brian Newman should have had an ecounter with Newlly. Newman this animal but yet able to be soft and dominate the so incontrole Newlly deep down inside that character thats what she wanted A man who could take her like a man and be damned raw animal passion thats what Newlly wanted and thats what Newlly needed.
2,An interesting premise fumbled away,"I was expecting a Thomas Harris type villian, i.e. Hannibal Lecter; what Steinberg gave me was the big spider from ""IT"". What a let-down. I wouldn't say the book was a complete waste of time, but the action was predictable and the characters were cardboard cutouts. I kept reading on, waiting for Newman to develop into something but it just bogged down into some psycho-babble about man's evolution into something crueler, yet Newman showed the most emotion of anyone. The ending was particularly disappointing. .The literary equivilent of a made-for-TV movie."
4,Good Read,"Good read. Fairly well paced, great premise, sympathetic characters. Bogs down on some of the psycho-babble but enjoyable"
4,Great Thriller,Great piece of work. It is better than the authors other book which was good too. The book has a great start and an attention keeping pace.
4,"Solid, but full of bugs, ironically enough","I agree with the review above: It's a little dry. However, it is certainly thorough, and if you're willing to sit and work through the examples, it's extremely informative. Ironically, I found a number of errors in the examples. Guess he should have applied his own methodology..."
1,Far too theoretical - no practical application,"You need a math background including set theory, graph theory, calculus, and combinatorics, in order to get much of anything out of this book.And, what you'll get has no practical application at all to real world, every day, practical software testing.This book belongs in a senior level math or comp.sci. college class. Fascinating reading, but don't buy this book if you need to learn how to do software testing in the real world. Buy it if you've been a software test team leader for several years, and have some academic interest in exploring the mathematical robustness of your test suites."
1,Very hard to follow this book,"If you don't ""Memorize"" Chapter 1 and 2 It is impossible to understand this book. I realy did not like his approach. I prefer people explain to me and understand the example instead of forcing us to memorize. If you are software Quality Engineer and tester and if you think you can use example of this book to devlope test script, forget this book. it is useless without memorizing above listed chapter."
2,Techniques may be useful but be cautious of opinions,"Dr. Beizer appears to use the medium of a textbook on black box testing, which is the domain of testers without knowledge of source code or design, to promote the opinion that independent testing is useless except to protect the independent tester. Later, he admits that 80 percent of an average product lifecycle is maintenance phase, which he admits is an appropriate use of independent testers, as he admits also their use for specialized testing tools such as performance tools. His techniques may be effective but an executive level review of this book could be dangerous to the future of quality software engineering practices."
2,Bali full support wear,"If you are heavy busted...such as the DD or larger range I would not suggest this bra....the support is not adequate. It was fine the first few times worn, but after that the support is simply not there any longer."
2,Not a comfortable fit.,It was just not long enough for me. The bra kept working its way down and smashing my chest. The search for a good bodysuit continues.
1,cheap pants good for a couple days,"The material is weak. I tore them my second day on trail, and the waist button ripped out the third. They are about as usefull as a costume for a night."
4,A must own for Pauline 'studyers',"Professor should not need any introduction, as perhaps one of the finest Pauline scholars in modern history, his reputation still proceeds his books. This set is his notes and compiled research over years of study. The content is still extremely relevant and insightful to both the meaning of the text and current scholarly debates. It truly should be on every student's shelf."
3,"Good, but...","Now, don't get me wrong - this book has more good things going for it than bad, but the whole thing just seems a bit off to me. There is a lack of focus, for one thing. Whose story is it? Tracy's? Abigail's? Matthews? Charlie's? I also figured it out about 1/3 of the way through the book but I was written well enough that I gladly stuck it out to see if I was right. (I was, but my theory about the motive was a tad bit off). This is not Margolin's best work ('The Burning Man' gets that honor) but it is a good enough read for a long holiday weekend."
3,A good read,"I'm not a big fan of legal thrillers, but I liked this book. Although not as good as his other book, Wild Justice, this one was a page-turner, and only a few pages throughout the courtroom testimony were boring. I was a little disappointed by the ending, but I would still recommend this book."
3,obsessions,"though obstensibly about capital punishment, this cleverly plotted novel really focuses on two psychologically damaged characters. workmanlike,uninspired prose."
3,A good storyteller,"I've read all Margolin's books, and he's a good story teller, which is what you want in this kind of potboiler. But apparently neither Margolin nor his editors understand the difference between the verbs: to lie and to lay. It's not a killer, but it is a strange and annoying shortcoming for somebody who's an attorney and a writer."
2,Too easy,"Gotta say, you read enough of this stuff, you figure it out. I knew who the murderer was early on, there were too many ""hints."" The twists and turns were fun, but I was just waiting to conclude my case!"
5,Such a good read,"I love books written by Phillip Margolin. I think I have read everything he has written. I really enjoyed this book. The story was interesting. It moved at a fast pace. The characters were well-developed and likable. I was not able to guess who the ""bad guy"" was and , when you are reading a mystery , that is a nice surprise. I was sorry to see the book end. Maybe Margolin will continue the characters in another book. I hope so."
3,Upgrade causes multi-user problems and isn't worth it - Great buy for first time buyer,"Don't Upgrade....Besides everything being on one screen it seems not much has changed since 2004 version, which we where forced to upgrade out of if we wanted to keep using payroll.One major problem is we have 2 companies and now- with the new edition -our server has to have Quickbooks open for multiple users to access the file (which also takes one of the licenses). If 2 users want to work in the other file they cannot.Trying to talk with a Quickbooks represenative about this issue is like hitting your head against the wall, although they are nice. One will have you install it one way and the other the next way and neither way gets you to a better solution.Anyway, overall Quickbooks is a good value for the money if this is your first software package, but I don't think it is worth an upgrade even from QB 2004 ."
3,Quickbooks Premiere 2007,"Overall the program is adequate, however, leave it to intuit to make everyone learn their program all over again. I only upgrade because I have to in order to use their payroll function. From the 2004 version to the 2007 version the entire user interface has changed causing me to have to rethink every action I perform in the program.Overall the program works ok, but I wouldn't recommend it for people that don't understand bookkeeping very well. With its ability to automatically adjust cost of goods sold from purchase information and automatically ""reconcile"" bank vs. general ledger differences, it sets up the unsuspecting user for either open balance equity items to address later or incorrect cost information being deducted because of incomplete or inaccurate inventory cost information entered into the system"
2,Definitely not worth the price,"We ordered the 5-user package for our office, to upgrade from Quickbooks2004, partly because the Intuit sales material touts its time-keeping ability integrated with the accounting. The installation was long, difficult and complicated. The timekeeping function is unusable. As was the case with 2004 version, you cannot use the program until you spend a lot of time (a LOT of time!) learning all the intricacies and non-intuitive user interface. The really aggravating thing is that 2007 introduces a whole new user interface, which means weeks of lowered production while we learn the new program. Just unacceptable. We uninstalled 2007, re-installed 2004, and we are sending the 2007 package back to Intuit for a refund."
3,QUickbooks 2007 Very Slow!!,"I have been using quickbooks for 9 years, and Just upgraded from quickbooks 2004, which I have been using for 3 years. Quickbooks 2007 is very slowwww, and locks up and crashes a few times a week. I wish companies would debug and prove out before releasing. Positive side, there is some nice new features and layouts once you get to know the structure."
4,Quickbooks for everyone.,"I have been using Quickbooks for 15 years and can tell you that they have come a long way with many improvments over the years. I have helped many people with both business and personal record keeping get started with Quickbooks and have not hardly found one who did not say that they didn't realise how easy bookwork could be until they tried these products.I have started using Quickbooks Premier 2007 and can tell you that the Google search has been a lifesaver when it comes to finding past information. It is so much easier than searching through invoices or bills to find information that someone else needs from a month or a year ago. I will be recommending to everyone I talk to about bookkeeping that this is the best Quickbooks to buy.To the designers of Quickbooks, I say, ""Keep up the good work!"" and ""Thanks"". To all others I can only say try it you will not believe how easy it is to use."
3,No emailing invoices without Purchasing Business Services,"You would think that simply emailing an invoice to your clients would be a standard feature. However this is not the case. The option to 'Email Invoice' is available, but when chosen, launches browser and attempts to log into Intuit Business Services wherein the Login Failed, service not supported.Also, the invoice templates are ugly, amateurish looking and not easily customizable.At this price you would expect more. This software is definitely for the novice business user. Use Peachtree or MS Small Business Accounting instead."
1,Can not use this product,"I bought this product because I have a client that is working with Quickbooks 2007 and I wanted to be able to take their file home without upgrading them, but I could not get it to upload properly because it was previously owned. I will never buy a previously owned product again"
5,Quickbooks Premier 2007 Review,I found this product to be very adequate in its performance and it is very easy to install and log on to.
2,"Intuit is greedy and ignorant, hope they face compatition","I am using QB Premium 2006 now and just upgraded my PC to Vista.I did not imagine that QB2006 was not compatible with Vista (my fault not to check) and no upgrades are available and Intuit is not planning any, recommending to upgrade to 2007 version.$300+ annual upgrade seems too expensive!Software is good, but not great and there is no justification for the price, except greed. With so many users, Intuit should be able to provide upgrade compatible with Vista for less...Looking around for competitive packages - MS Office Accounting looks good (and MUCH less expensive) - I'll check that one out!"
1,I don't feel like a pirate,"I wish I had more to offer however, when I ran into my first roadblock using the Quickbooks Retail 2007 it asked me to register it. When I called to do that, they told me that the copy I bought was pirated!! Then they aggressively tried to sell me one at full retail. 45 minutes later, 1 supervisor and 1 manager, I was offered a 15% discount and all of the things that they already give you for free.I am very disappointed so far."
5,ARP Studs,"What is there to say about them? ARP makes the best product hands down. Make sure when you install them to use the lubricant on all of the threads. When you tighten the studs into the block, finger tighten, and then back them out about 1/4 to 1/2 of a turn. These studs will expand and contract with temperature change, so they need that bit of space to prevent block damage.Tighten them to a max of 80FT/LBS, going in 20 pound increments.Tighten order:9 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 87 | 3 | 1 | 6 | 10"
3,"But then, I dislike philosophy","This book is not horribly difficult to read, providing a line by line commentary on Nahuatl philosophy-poetry. However, if you're looking for an easy to read, general overview of the philosophy, I do not recommend Aztec Thought and Culture. It simply gets too detailed too fast."
4,Ridge Runner Outdoor Axe,"Pros: Compact, light weight reasonable pricedCons: Dull edge so you will have to sharpen. Handle is flimsy. Very thin it could use more girth on the axe head.Other notes shipping was almost as much as the cost of the axe but it was at my house with in three days."
3,"Nice axe, but...",This is a nice little axe. It came sharp and stayed that way while splitting some wood chunks for the grill. The sheath was an obvious after thought because if you put it on your belt the axe will slide right out of it. It would have rated 4 or maybe even 5 stars had it not been for the lame fitting sheath.
1,Don't bother,Spend a few extra bucks and get something that is actually usable.Very chheap handle and steel. Poorly balanced hatchet.
5,Why has no one made a movie of this book?,"Or better yet, an HBO mini-series to capture every glittering nuance? This book is peopled with unforgettable characters. Floyd Cox has to be one of the most loathsome characters in modern fiction. When superficial claptrap like When Stella Got Her Groove Back automatically goes to the big screen, it's a shame to see substantive novels like this one ignored"
4,This book was great!!,Your blues aint like mine was very emotional. From the beggining it catches your attention till the end. When your reading it you feel like your an actual character from the book.
5,Your Blues Ain't LIke Mine,"""The blues is something in your soul telling you they ain't no hope, shit ain't never gon' be right."" (p. 410)This multi-generational book begins in the 50's in the Mississippi Delta and carries the reader through to the mid-80's. Ms. Campbell did an incredible job of portraying the racial conflicts in this time and place. Definitely a book with adult content, I would highly recommend it to those who are trying to understand the origins of racial tensions in the South. Kudos to Ms. Campbell for an heroic epic. My only criticism is that the last quarter of the book is hurried up as she brings the characters forward to face the changes that came as a result of integration."
5,"A classic tale of good and evil, karma and how one event in life has the ability to alter all involved.",I read this book so long ago but it has stayed number one in my best books of all time.RIP Mrs. Campbell you will always be missed and remembered fondly.
2,A Novel of Many Flaws,"This novel is not the great masterpiece that everyone claims it is. The story is extremely slow moving and only encompasses three days of time. There is a great deal of repition and excessive detail. There is not sense of urgency or action as you might think a war novel would include. Many episodes, including Pilar's story about the episode in her villiage, Maria's rape, and Sodo's death could be ommited or at least greatly summarized. Although the book is almost five hundred pages long it could be summarized in ten pages. The love affair between Jordon and Maria is overly idealized and is extremely unbelieveable. Maria's bland and submissive personality and their dialouge make me physically sick. It seems appropriate to say that Hemingway had absolutely no idea about women. This book is not worth your precious time."
4,The Cultiure and Lifestyles of Japan,"Jack Seward covers the spectrum of Japanese Life and Thought in his book 'The Japanese: The often Misunderstood, Sometimes Surprising, and Always Fascinating Culture and Lifestyles of Japan. With a jaunty air he covers the need for hot springs and communal baths, matters sexual, crime and punishments and the colourful ways you can leave this world by disembowelment. He also looks at the humor in mis-translation and the Japanese thought on our miscreant Western ways.Its a good read and a must for anybody visiting Japan or a hard core arm chair traveller."
2,"Valuable info, but disappointing writing","I found Jack Seward's book valuable for the amount of interesting insights it contained, but I think that many of his views and assessments are outdated. In addition, he occasionally gets sidetracked by passionate feelings on certain subjects (America's high crime rate, prejudice against biracial children). These long monologues are extremely angry and at times offensive (Seward claims that crime is an activity engaged in primarily by 'Negroes' and that those who would rehabilitate criminals are 'bleeding hearts'), and I felt that they detracted from the book's credibility. I think Seward's book might have been revolutionary when it was first published, but I didn't find it very helpful in the year 2000."
4,cheap & great,"It's beautiful, look very nice and make my mom happy. The price was great because was cheap"
1,piece of chinese junk,it's a piece of junk made by the chinese. my nephew hates it ... his fart is louder than this gun.
3,Fun product not well packed and not very durable,We bought this for our seven year old son. The packaging was very poor and the unit was banged up. He did not mind the nicks and dents in the product. He loves playing with it. The trigger guard broke off after several days and he was disappointing but still loves playing with the gun.
2,Caps don't fire,Ordered this to use at a Civil War enactment at my son's school. He was very excited to receive it until the caps arrived a few days later. They just will not fire. The post in the hole where the caps mount is neither centered nor long enough. I tried centering it and we tried firing dozens of times. Never a pop. The caps have the model number it says to use for this rifle and work well in another toy gun. Shoddy or uneven construction. If the caps worked I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.
2,civil war musket,"My 8 year old loves the musket, but I was disappointed with the quality. What can you expect when it is made in China. I should have realized for the price that it would be low quality. The trigger has already broken, so I certainly can't recommend it."
2,Not right for use as stage prop,"Might be fine as toy for kids. I bought 4 to use as props in a stage production. I thought I read the gun was 53"" long which it wasn't. Needed to add a larger gun stock to make it look more accurate. Hammer and side plate looked realistic but I would have been better off cutting out of wood, adding conduit for barrel, 3/8"" dowel for ram rod and painting them. That is if you do it yourself or have a volunteer and don't need to pay someone."
3,One Problem,"My boys love these muskets... one problem though... The wood around trigger area breaks easily. I have one still functional, three that need to be fixed. A recommendation... Before you let your kids play with them, crazy glue a small plate of metal on the side to reinforce it. It would be a lot easier to prevent than to fix after the faxt."
4,A toy with history,Son loves this gun. Civil War musket was a huge hit since he's so into the Civil War video game. Well made & simple. Delivered right on time just before Christmas.
2,not all that great,"I bought this for my son along with a couple thousand roll caps. When I gave it to him him for valentines day we discovered that it doesn't use roll caps as the descripton implies but rather the single plastic cap type caps. So here he is with a gun and a bunch of caps that he can't use with it. The gun itself is ok, (nothing special and certainly not what I would describe as high quality as some other reviewers have said), but the fact that it wasn't as described makes me wonder if they have replaced the gun in the description with one that is more cheaply made."
3,Good filter but installation was a pain,"I bought this filter for my new house. It was a big pain to install if you don't have a special hole in your countertop already. I had that new hole drilled and the handyman noticed that the unit didn't come with some of the necessary parts. I called the manufacture to get them and they didn't help at all. We had to search for something similar. IN the end, I paid $700 to install it!!!!! It seems to work fine but I wouldn't do it again - at least not with this one."
2,A flawed budget thriller,"This is a little second feature from 1937, a low-budget detective story that contains the odd pleasure of seeing John Barrymore in one of his last films. The story, taken from a novel, is fairly entertaining, and the acting is competent. However, the print is terrible, and the sound is not much better. There is no excuse for selling any film in such poor condition."
2,John Howard just does not make a good Bulldog,"It looks like Bulldog (John Howard) is getting married to Phyllis (Louise Campbell) and giving up the detecting racket.Only this time the movie stats out with Phyllis' kidnapping. From there is Bulldog formula.The copy I watched is an Alpha Video poor quality 1937 version at 58 minutes. The screenplay based on ""Bulldog Drummond and the Female of the Species"" by H.C. ""Sapper"" McNeile."

2,not the best picture quality,"This movie is very good as were most of the Bulldog Drummond films, but the picture quality is rather poor."
3,just ok,"My 4 year old has so many little pony toys, this was her least favorite. If I'm not there to play with her, it's too hard to squeeze her fingers in there to ""get"" the ice cream cones or put the table on top. The toy is reallt sturdy though because it came down the stairs so many times to ""deliver"" ice cream and it's still ringing and in one piece."
4,very useful in games where the corps play big,"I liked the book overall, and found that a lot of background info was given to help anyone who cared learn about the big 10. The mega-corps are all very well-detailed, and some of the info has mucho potential as GM material and story hooks. However, I thought that the game info section with the rules could have been a bit better, such as maybe including general pay scale for certain types of shadowruns. But that's just me. Overall, the book rocked. Get it if the Big 10 interest you at all, and especially if you're a GM planning on some corporate espionage!"
5,anyone who injoys role playing games should play shadowrun.,shadowrun is one of the best rpg made. this is my opinion but you you should definatly should get it.
5,very essential,"a must have right away.words&music are really put together here the way they should be.timeless Jewels that Sound Stronger as time passes by.You Send Me,Only Sixteen&the Other Essentials here really showcase this Soul Giant."
1,It seems country and jazz don't mix,I mostly listen to two kinds of music - country and jazz. Guess what - they don't cross over. I will never play this album again.
3,Roland's review,"This cd is like a good cigar. It has a great start, and a silk smooth body, but kind of a bland finish. It is worth owning just to here Merle sing the classicis, he has that drop off of the table base in his voice, much like Bing Crosby, a very good effort by Mr. Haggard."
1,Merle Haggard - unforgetable,"I own just about every album/tape/cd Merle ever made. I am a die hard Merle fan...BUT....Merle, you are way too mellow on this one. This to me is a cross between smooth jazz and lounge music. Not COUNTRY!! I'm sorry!! Whenever you come to our state I go to see you but if this is the future, I'll need lots of coffee to stay awake while you do this segment of your performance. Sorry ""HOSS"", get back to basics."
5,Great read for novice and experienced alike!,"There are many books out about selling your home without an agent. This one in particular is the best I have seen. The author does a good job of not talking over your head with ""industry jargon"" and uses language that is easy to read and understand. The author provides specific ideas on how to effectively market your home, identifies each of the necessary parties involved in the transaction, and clearly details all of the costs involved for the seller which most people do not realize exist.As a Real Estate Appraiser, I have been involved in thousands of transactions over the last 5 years. Only after reading this book did I finally understand all of the complexities involved in selling and purchasing real estate."
4,Seem very strong and the threads really bite!,"These are great to work with. I don't know how well they last. Time will tell. They are strong, bite well with no pre-drilling necessary at all. I like the #2 square drive as opposed to philips."
1,I MAY not finish it --- LOUSY!!,"I usually LOVE Gregg Olsen's stuff, but this book REEKS! WAY too many people to keep up with, and trying to follow his story line is like trying to have a meaningful relationship with a MOTH! And worse than that, the graphic detail is just GROSS --- WAY too much information about homosexual sex. I am about halfway through the book and I am ready to just forget about it, but I keep thinking that he will FINALLY get to the point and tell me how this miscreant got the punishment he so RICHLY deserves. The main reason I read true crime is that it restores my faith that the ""bad guys"" get their just deserts, unlike O.J. and Cullen Davis, but I digress. Gregg screwed up ROYALLY with this one. Don't waste your money."
2,Graphic,"I was unable to finish this book. The explicit homosexuality described was too much. If I had known, I would never have purchased it."
3,book arrived fine - haven't read it yet,will save for winter reading - thank you for the prompt shippingthe reviews indicate I will probably like it but it has been such nice weather this fall - I can't see staying in to readwill tune back in next month after reading and give a fair rating
2,poorly written,My expectations of this book were really good based on the number of 4 and 5 star ratings. I was dissappointed and did not find the book nearly as compelling as other true crime stories I have read.
2,An ok book,"Way to homosexually graphic for me, I wish I had a warning, I would not have purchased this book. I know more about sex toys than I want to know"
2,Way too much information,"At first I thought this book was going to be really good, but as it went on and on, with no progress toward a resolution, I just had to give up on it. Olsen went into way, way too much detail about Eli's gay sexlife. I'm no homophobe, but after awhile, I became grossed out by descriptions of 'ball stretchers, cock rings and fisting'. It's like Olsen himself had the obsession. I would have liked to find out if Eli was punished for his crimes, but after reading two thirds of the book, and Olsen still dwelling on Elis lovers and penis size, I realized life is too short to waste any more time on this book."
2,Disappointing,"while the author takes us into the unseen world of the Amish culture, his graphic details about Eli Stutzman's homosexual escapades in front of his young son were a bit much for me. Also, I really do not care to know about the size of a killers penis when I am reading a story. How this was relevant to the plot one can only fathom."
5,Abandoned Prayers,"It was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The story was set partly in the area I live and there were so many facts that I can remember now from the past in reference to a couple of unsolved murders that it is scary to think all of those horrible things were going on in this rural area. The book tied so many loose ends from many years ago and really brought reality home. There are alot of sick sick people we did not even know existed. Unfortunately, they still exist and we hope Eli Stutzman dies a slow and painful death as he forced Danny to do. The book made us so much more aware of the ongoing and past atrocities committed in this small community. Unfortunately, it also woke us up to the fact just how naive we really are. It is shocking to know that Eli Stutzman is actually out of prison and able to commit his crimes on unknowing new victims."
5,Best True Crime Book Ever,This is the best true crime book ever written. From page one I couldn't put it down. Read it all in one night.
2,Is it so hard to believe?,"Sad to say... this story is totally believable (good things since it's a TRUE CRIME story). But it still shocks me that the ""Englishers"" are so ready to believe the Amish are incapable of commiting such crimes and that Amish are so ready to look past everything a ""member"" does."
5,One of my top picks of 2004,"This is probably My top pick for the best true crime book of 2004..It is equaled only by Jack Olsens~I~Which I read this year as well..This was a very well written book My True crime book club on yahoo groups all talked alot about this one..I have enjoyed reading Gregg Olsen over the years and he is getting better with each book. I wont give the story away here but it tells the story of the death of ""little Boy Blue"" with an Amish twist,..Great True Crime! Keep em coming Mr Olsen."
4,grizzly account,"In this true life account of the actions of a former member of the Amish community, we find out the details of the life of an evil man, but are left wondering why. Perhaps the answer is known only to the perpetrator, or perhaps he doesn't understand himself. Narcissism at its worst."
5,"Gregg Olsen brings ""Little Boy Blue"" to life for us!!","The story of ""Little Boy Blue"" is just what Olsen describes it to be: shocking! As a Nebraskan, I remember when Danny Stutzman's body was found frozen near Chester, Nebraska, and I followed local news accounts of the investigation. I didn't really know the story, however, until I read Olsen's account of little Danny Stutzman's life and death. Olsen's thorough investigation and interviews and his powerful writing of Danny's story leaves no doubt about the identity of Danny's murdered. So why has Danny's killer never been brought to justice??"
5,Great underwater housing.,"Bought this case for the Canon SD900. It works beautifully. Unlike other housings I've used, you can change all the settings on the camera from the outside. And if you buy it here you will get a bargain."
5,great service,"The product I ordered is hard to find in stores. I was delighted to find it here, and pleased with the quick delivery."
1,1960 Sartre meets Bodhidharma,"Zen Buddhism It's Practice and the Transcendental MIndImagine a Christian saying I am an atheist and I do not believe in God,Jesus was fairy tale but I am Christian. There you have it Existentialism is a dead a philosophy as there is these days. Its only rarely taught in a history of philosophy survey course.Warmed over William Barrett's irrational"
2,Mediocre,I can only imagine that if you are looking to buy this book it is because it's required for some sort of class you're taking in high school or college. It is poorly written and I wouldn't put too much thought into his interpretations.
2,needed better instructions,this product was what I was looking for but the instuctions were not that great I still have not installed them because I can not figure out how to put them on I am going to Air Shocks instead
3,Intermediate Musician,"This product is for those who have next to no experience on the guitar. He teaches very basic chords, doesn't even talk much about scales, and teaches 3 very basic fingerpicking patterns. I am a self taught guitar player and wanted to close some gaps in holes of my own teaching. I personally found no use out of this product. It doesn't mean it's bad, it's just wasn't for me. He's not the greatest teacher, but he does get the point across for the most part. If you know basic major, minor, and seventh chords, can keep a rhythm, and know some basic fingerpicking patterns... I wouldn't waste your money. If you're just starting and you enjoy folk music (That's all you learn is folk music), then this might just be the video for you."
5,start from ground zero,"Im just learning to play, self taught, and this 2 disc set is perfect. Its more than what I expected. All basic info from holding pik to strumming to switching chords and some runs with explanation of where notes are within chords. Hamburger has a great method and personality that really makes it fun."
5,Great value,"I was surprised that it covered folk music, though once I started looking for videos of other people playing those songs and saw the wide interpretations and variations out there, I quite appreciated this being a starting point for my education. Straight off the bat I feel comfortable changing lyrics, making me feel more creative, and he even encourages changing cords up. Sometimes I get a little strict about things, this is a nice relaxed approach and I'm loving it. I've started the dvd a couple of weeks ago and am only about halfway through the first video and I have enough practice material to last a couple of weeks without watching further yet. I like that it will take me time to get through this, it makes the cost even more worthwhile. If you like deadpan dry wit, he'll entertain you while you learn. Reading other reviews I see that some methods don't show how to play songs while you learn, so I appreciate this even more.From an absolute beginner's standpoint, this is a great video."
5,dvd content review,quick delivery...I am looking forward to the going through the lessons inside. Content looks as though it will cover the basics and some. I purchased this product for a review and enhancement of what I already know...thanks
3,Straightforward sales advice,"This brief sales guide offers solid suggestions for such powerful techniques as asking questions, listening to customers, taking notes, using call sheets and doing research to turn selling into a standardized, measurable and repeatable process. If none of that sounds new to you, the problem isn't you. But that doesn't mean the advice isn't sound. It is. Author Brian Sullivan, a motivational speaker, has packaged old guidance in a new wrapper that he calls the ""Precise Selling Formula."" He says nothing that is outright wrong and much that is outright right. We think his elementary but helpful book (and its accompanying CD) will be most useful to inexperienced salespeople who lack self-confidence, and who may need exhortation and reassurance. The author's earthy anecdotes, Kansas City optimism and self-deprecating but enthusiastic tone may be just what novice salespeople crave after a day in the trenches."
3,"Good music, insipid production","This is the best in all the MET Ring videos. Behrens is in a better element here and the cast is, on the whole, not bad. However, the production is rather boring and insipid but the orchestral playing offers considerable compensation."
2,Not at all enjoyable,"This, I'm afraid, isn't good enough to convert people to Wagnerian drama. While the traditional staging has its merits (such that viewers readily understand the essence of the polot), both the stage direction and singing fall rather short of expectations, and such an impression cannot be rescued by the fine performance of the Met orchestra.This is a performance that is better sampled through audio recording than via DVD."
2,Mediocre viewing and listening experience,"This Walkure production has drawbacks both musically and visually. While James Morris has the right size of voice for Wotan, his range of tone colour is seriously limited. As a result, his Wotan comes across as rather one-dimensional. Hildegard Behrens certainly looks the part of the warrior maiden. Unfortunately, her voice is worn and her lower register is virtually non-existent. Jessye Norman sings with a radiant tone, yet both she and her partner, Gary Lakes, are just not convincing at all on the stage for these roles. The other smaller parts are just adequately taken. The Met orchestra is on top form under the sure hand of James Levine. However, Levine's interpretation is not very memorable. The production is a rather traditional one and while it does not offer anything outrageous, it is playing a bit too safe. Some of the stage direction is in fact rather unimaginative and constricted. On the whole, just a mediocre viewing and listening experience."
3,Hard to Love,"Purchased this album after hearing about this band on NPR's Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me. I don't understand the prevalence of 5 star reviews. Honestly, this album is very difficult to love. There are a few tracks that have grown on me (for example, Quattro). But most of the songs are a combination of several of the following: slow, experimental, instrumental, devoid of hooks, entirely minor chords, plodding. Three stars is generous."
3,Rejuvenated,"Feast of Wire comes closest to capturing the excitement and atmosphere of Calexico's live performances than previous releases--meaning it's not quite as dull as Hot Rail or Black Light--and there are a couple of surprises along the way.I commented on another Calixico review that the band may be painting itself into a musical corner, but Feast of Wire contains a lot more variety than we're used to from the band. I don't think they're done yet.Joey Burns sounds more confident at the microphone, although the vocals are still the weakest aspect of this band. Paul Niehaus (Paul Burch, Lambchop) adds some nice steel guitar.This, plus the debut release Spoke, is really all the Calexico you need to hear."
5,"""It's the big one, Elizabeth!!!!""","Could it be: GOOD... NEW... MUSIC???!!!!! Hallelujah!!!!!!!Just when you thought there wasn't any good new popular music, along comes Calexico with the best album (thus far) of their career. Great stuff. Keep up the good work, boys."
1,"Slow, boring, not my style","I purchased this disc both on the glowing recommendations on this site and because of a particularly catchy song from a soundtrack. While the soundtrack song is on here, the rest of the disc stole all the energy and magic and I have distaste now for the one song I liked. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't this. The songs drag and are depressing. They lack creativity and there's no spark that goes along with music coming from people who really enjoy crafting music. Take time to listen to the samples before buying. I didn't and regret it. (Please purchase mine used above:). Thanks."
1,More quasi-Mexican hoo-ha.,"Another yawn-fest of boring pseudo-folk songs from this overrated Tucson band. White people professing their Hispanic influences is about as valid as Vanilla Ice pretending to be down with the 'hood, and using a Mariachi band as back-up musicians is just as offensive as John Courgar Mellencamp utilizing gospel singers to make it seem like he's a funk soul brother. Sorry, Calexico, but you're Gringos and you always will be--no amount of lyrics about migrant workers eating tortillas is ever going to change that. On top of this, the music is so laid-back, so devoid of energy, it's positively coma-inducing. It makes Giant Sand sound like Metallica. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
5,Best Album of 2003,"Calexico have always been good. Their music has always struck a chord with me. The one criticism I've had is that it veered too much into the spagetti western although it was some of what they did best. With Feast of Wire, they moved further away from that. Sure, its still there, but they've become more authentic. Songs like Guero Canelo, Black Heart, Not Even Stevie Nicks, Woven Birds, & Sunken Waltz make this by far the best CD of year (w/ White Stripes's Elephant taking 2nd). Many reviews use words like masterpiece to describe this album. I hope it isn't. To me it feels like the build up to something truly staggering."
4,Filling buffet,"As good a balance of familiar and fresh found, from one of the only relevant Tex-Mex sounds around."
5,Super collection of newer songs.,Listening to this comes as easy as a soft afternoon in the shade of maple tree. Each listen reveals more and does not tire. Recommended.
3,"For best results, see live","My first introduction to Calexico was seeing them playing live at Somerset House in London in the summer of 2003, and they were absolutely breathtaking. As with all live bands, the studio album is always something of a anticlimax, as it's almost impossible to recreate the atmosphere and rush of seeing them live. Still, it's a grower of an album and is a must for any respectable record collection."
3,worth a buy if you do not mind typos,"Clinical Application of Neuromuscular Techniques is an alternative to Travell's Trigger Point Manual if you do not do TP injections. It has great pictures, well explained treatment techniques (if you are up to date with your anatomy and medical terms) and lots of references. The disadvantage are typos (the editor must have had a bad day and was unable to write the German words for the references right, but also some English words are off!) Parts of the text are repeated in the book twice, what I thought is unnecessary and only adds to the number of pages but not the quality of content."
5,Great Book For Kids!,This is an excellent book for children of all ages. The pictures are amusing and fun to enjoy. I've had this book since I was little and look forward to sharing it with my own children someday.
4,Legion of Boom,"Crystal Method is my FAVORITE band/techno group of all time. I love them to death. I finally was able to pick up the long awaited new album (at least for me). I like it a lot. Its pretty good. Its not as groundbreaking as the past two, but its good. It a flawless combination of their previous two CDs. It has the darkness and synthetic feel of Vegas combined with the happy, poppy, guitarish sound of Tweekend. Its best described as a Dark Tweekend.Old fans, pick it up. Its a nice complimenter to the previous two CDs. Its probably the least out of the 3 albums, but its still worth it. New fans, I suggest picking up either of the previous albums, Vegas or Tweekend, before coming here. Legion of Boom isn't a good place to start. But then don't forget to pick it up, because its some pretty good stuff.Standout Tracks: Born Too Slow, True Grit, American Way, Bound Too Long, Acetone"
2,Legion of Snooze,"After the awesome releases of 'Community Service' & 'Tweekend', there is not a TCM fan who didn't realise the next album would be a failure. No way could the energy & beats of the previous 2 slabs be surpassed or even equalled.The tracks seem to almost be on auto-pilot; some of them proving blatantly boring & amateur.Not a total loss, though...there are 2 or 3 tracks that burst out with expected Crystal Method style; 'Bound Too Long' & 'Acetone' actually woke me out of a 'Legion of Boom' nap.The rest of the disc, i cannot recall anything unique or of good mention, even after several dozen plays in the cd deck.Diehard fans only should consider buying this, as it is a pathetic example of what Scott & Ken are capable of."
2,"ok, but treading water","Las Vegas/Los Angeles-based duo who have been the US'smost commercially successful producer of big beat electronica.The problem with The Crystal Method is that they essentiallyhave only one musical idea. They seem to recognize this, bringingin guest vocalists like Milla Jovovich (track 5) and ex-Limp Bizkit Nashvillian Wes Borland for this third album, but the better tracks are more or less reincarnations of 1997's ""Busy Child."" In other words, Legion of Boom might make a fine soundtrack to a video game or car commercial, but is rarely engaging on its own."
2,No longer breaking ground.,"Mainly this showing is just boring. And after seeing TCM in a DJ set, and hearing what they choose to spin for the crowd, I just can't listen to them anymore. They get a star for obviously having some technical skills... but that doesn't equal sounding good."
3,Not innovative: the Method that used to be,"I decided to give this album a shot. Having heard some of their earlier works, I figured their 2004 release should have something to offer. While not boring, I found it lacking. It didn't bring anything new to the table: same old Chemical Brothers-type beats (""High and Low"" are straight up Brothers!), with guitar riffs going with them (in the same style as BT's 'Emotional Technology'). Milla Jovovich's contibution in ""I Know It's You"" is lovely, but falls in the same sack of reused, stylish techno beats that used to be trendy back in the late nineties. Long story, short: can't give 'em more than 3 stars. Not a bad work, but seriously lacking any new contributions."
2,Sounds more like a Jam session than a record...,One my most personal seminal moments with electronic music was when the acid rock tinged 'Keep Hope Alive' hit my ears. Then the amazing 'Get Busy Child' followed it up with an even more amazing recipe for bouncy synths and beats.Many years later 'Legion of Boom' fails the attempt of making an exciting record. The beats are typically arranged and the musical arrangments seem to take me nowhere. I'm caught in a loop of the same sounds and the same tempos. They should have titled this release 'Moebius Loops' because every track has a real ground-hog day effect on me.This album is nothing new and it's utterly boring. It sounds dated and it lacks any innovation. It feel not as well thought out as previous works by these lads.
4,"Very enjoyable CD, but not exactly what I expected from TCM","I for one really liked this CD. Although it isn't perfect, most of the songs are very good. With a bunch of big beats, and electronic riffs similar to Vegas, it cranks out nice sounding tunes all the way through. Lots of funk-a-licious beats to break to, and some old style TCM, Vegas-sounding songs (True Grit) to bomb down the freeway to.All in all, I think it's a very good CD, but maybe not what TCM fans would expect."
4,TCM: LOB,"The negative reviews of LOB are encouraging me to pick up all other TCM records that I don't have.I remember liking whatever TCM song I heard on the radio. When I came across Legion of Boom at my local public library... yes, my public library, I borrowed the CD and loved it from first listen. ""American Way"" is the only song I'm ever tempted to skip over...I think this is an excellent record."
5,Crystal strikes GOLD,"Now, I am familiar with a few of The Crystal Method's older works but not all of them. I've always kind of admired them from afar sort of afraid to jump right in and give them the ""GO AHEAD"" signal. They have always produced body rocking head bobbing beats that make you want to get up and dance or just hum along to the tune all day long. This album was the one that got me hooked.I can play this c.d. from track #1 all the way through without skipping a song and not loosing the good vibes that I feel. Whether I'm doing housework, studying, playing video games or just getting ready for a night out on the town you cannot deny the incredible production that this album represents. I will reccommend this to anyone who wants to get into this kind of music or who just wants to know The Crystal Method more. They are on a different plane than Fatboy Slim and in my opinion, a much greater one."
2,Legion of boom??? Where is the boom???,"Well... I have been a method fan for a long time. Vegas and tweekend both have that sound that just makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Vegas and tweekend were PHAT sounding records. If you need a good dose of some synth bass, and some dope beats check out those two records.Legion of BOOM seems to have left out the BOOM. I would have to disagree with the other reviewers and say that this record has much less life and phatness than the other two. Nothing on this disc even matches the sheer in your face bass on PHD. If this record wasn't put out by the crystal method I probably would have liked it a bit better. (because I expect more out of the method) I do enjoy the disc, but I think the talent is there and these two could have done much better. No tracks really jump out at me as being any better than the others. All of the tracks seem to blend together. One other note... if you get a chance check them out live. They put on a quality show."
3,Not Their Best Work,"Crystal Meth has not really changed their sound (save for the new single), however the tracks are MUCH more repetitive and dark sounding. The single ""Born Too Slow"" sounds like a completely different band and is NOT indicative of what the rest of the CD sounds like.The CD overall is fair, but not their best work, which I think is Tweekend where every track was an individual masterpiece."
2,Lame Vocals and Lyrics wreck the tunes,"This new CD struck me by surprise in a bad way: it has lot more vocals than usual and the tracks have a nearly constant vocal hip-hop thing going. No thanks. I like my electronica a little less grimy. One person said listen to UNKLE, but that is also electronica with a voice-heavy hip-hop flavor. Be warned: this CD is quite different from Crystal Method's previous stuff. It is a shame because I liked their previous stuff."
4,Pure Meth.,"After listening to this CD a few times I've figured out what it's sound is, the way my ears hear it. It's The Crystal Method from beginning to end. It's a synthesis of Vegas and Tweekend, different from either but the same as both. If you bought it expecting it to be just like Vegas OR just like Tweekend, well, it ain't either.When I first listened to Tweekend I was dismayed to hear that it wasn't another Vegas. But, after a couple listen-throughs, all was well. They are different, no doubt. But, they're both great CDs. Same goes for Legion of Boom.It's got the eerie, almost sonar-like pings and echoes that underpin Vegas. It's also got the guitars that at first surprised me on Tweekend.If you're a fan of this band, have a mind open to the fact that these guys are artists, and that ALL artists evolve, grow and often change throughout their careers, then you'll like this CD."
2,A real disappointment...,"Having been to several of TCM's concerts in different venues, I was dying to hear this album. I can't say that it was better than their previous two releases but it's growing on me. I'd say half the album works for me and is truly different. A few songs leave me laughing because of the childish lyrics and undramatic bass lines. Maybe it's (Legion) so different that I have to learn to like TCM in a new way(?) I'll be pulling out my Vegas album again to recall the good 'ole days."
3,Once Again Skipping Every Other Song...,"What is with artists these days? Maybe it's just me, but I am getting pretty tired of buying CDs, and having to skip every other song! Ok it's not that bad. But it's frustrating to hear artists cursing people for downloading music when they should be buying the CDs instead. Well this is why we download music, because mostly artists are only interested in making money rather than music. I shake my head at the music biz. It's hard to find a decent, well produced, well vocally CD now a days. And 50% of the songs on Legion are made extremely well, it's just the other half that falls short, very very short. You've been warned..."
4,CM Keeps Doing What They Do Best,"Fans and newcomers alike will enjoy this release. It continues the same style of big beats with rock guitars and tough samples that their previous album, ""Tweekend"", utilized, especially on tracks like Born Too Slow, with its quality rock vocals, and the satisfyingly crunchy Weapons of Mass Distortion. But tracks like Broken Glass, Acetone, and Wide Open also harken back to the smoother, more synthesizer-based sounds of their first full-length, ""Vegas"", and serve to balance this album better than its predecessor. There are also a few nicely-executed doses of hip-hop and soul flavor to round out the diversity of the sound.I can't really justify giving this album 5 stars because it doesn't break much new ground, but rather fine-tunes an already successful formula. But if you enjoy big, driving electronica infused with rock sensibilities, it doesn't get much bigger or better than this."
2,"dull, dont blow your money","Being a fan of the Vegas Crystal Meth, I was excited when I heard ""Born Too Slow"" hit the air waves and couldn't wait to check out the CD. Turns out its a big disappointment. The guest appearances are uninspiring, the beats tend go no where, and there's just well...no kick. It's a decent album, but decent drum n bass aint worth buying because well...its drum and bass...you need something to keep your attention, something to set your act apart from others. Or at the very least some nice guest acts to keep intermediary songs fresh. Let me put it this way: the album will bore you to tears. Think some beats with an occasional repetitive voice saying ""synthesizer, crystalizer"" over and over. If you aren't paying attention it's nice to work to though.Stand out tracks: Bound too long, I know its you, born too slow"
1,What a let down,"TCM may be our next Milli Vanilli. How does a group produce a CD like Vegas and 5 years later produce something like Legion of Boom? The CD should be titled ""THE REGRESSION MOVEMENT"". This CD was so disappointing that I decided not to give them any more money by seeing their show in LA. When other artists (like BT) are out there developing as musicians and putting out music that is elevating the electronica genre it is a crime to invest in a CD like Legion of Boom. There isn't even a redeeming song to rationalize buying this...Well I should have listened to the other reviews. Don't make the same mistake I did."
4,Legion of 'Bust',"This is not The Crystal Method that was in Vegas. Nor are they the ones who were there for that Tweekend. This is new..And not particularly better. This is The Method's fade into using a Legion Of guest vocalists, busting the roll they had. Boom. Gone.Am I being harsh? All I know is that the only songs I've heard featured in any movie or commercial using their music have been the ones without said vocals. Weither that's for legal reasons or not, I don't know. I'd like to think the unwashed masses that are producers agree with me, but, again, what do I know?Listen to this only if you really like the Method, or are into Electro or Experimental Techno. If you're buying this just because you're a fan-girl of Wes Borland (should he have any fan-girls), well...don't.Guys, you disappointed me. I hope you can make up for it with your next release. I trust you will.- Henry"
3,Legion of Boom,"I have to say, I was very excited to purchase this new one when it first came out. After listening to the whole disc, I was a little dissappointed though. Although Chrystal Method is more of an instrumental type band than a strong vocal band, I did expect a little more. Now that I have had a chance to hear it a few more times I have to say there are some really great tracks even though they do lack vocals they make up for it with beats and bass. I would recommend this to someone that is planning a party or is a DJ, because I classify this CD as clubbing music because of the repetiveness."
3,Crystal furthers the big-beat method,"This American duo jumped into the UK's big-beat game awhile back, formulaic and predictable, but always exceptionally good. In typical Crystal Method fashion, 'Legion Of Boom' reverberates with speaker-shredding beats and thumping basslines. Just think The Propellerheads combined with the spacey soundscapes of Bonobo or Bowery Electric, the balance tipping towards dark ultra-chicness. The dance groove hasn't been sacrificed however, still propelled by hypnotic rhythms/beats, electronic shocks, and occasional guitar barrages, eg, Prodigy. The imagery combines e-induced dance vitriol and sci-fi time-warps, a CD where you can visualize the impending future and move your feet at the sametime. Highly recommended afterdark."
3,"Lazy, but OK","This is a pretty lazy effort from The Crystal Method. It's not bad, but there's not much to it. Yes, the beats are BIG, which is nice. But most of those beats are pretty basic, and once a song gets going, that's it - you don't have to worry about change-ups or breaks, just the same thing over & over again. Tweekend didn't break new ground either, but at least on that album TCM's technical ability was pretty awe-inspiring - there's all sorts of stuff going on in those tracks. Here the beats are pretty average, the composition is bland, and the lyrics are just painful even by electro standards. Even the guest appearances fall flat - Rahzel's talents are completely wasted.Basically, Legion of Boom feels like TCM is just going through the motions. It's not bad, but in a month you won't be listening to more than a track or two. I bump it up to three stars because it goes BOOM, and because John Garcia makes everything better."
4,Great Stuff,"How do you top a killer techno CD like 'Vegas'? It's hard to do and it's questionable whether this CD does it or not, but on it's own, this is a great electronica set. There is no bad music on here in my opinion, but there are some tracks that stand out more than others. 'Starting Over', 'Born Too Slow' and 'Bound Too Long' are the primary tracks for me, but the whole album is worth the listen. Is it better than Vegas? That's up in the air, but I love this CD regardless."
4,"I agree with ""Don't be hate-in""","I like this cd. I thought tweekend was lame! Vegas was awesome and this one is almost there, but can you really compare it with vegas? It is just a different album. If you like electronica from people like paul oakenfold ,the trance albums, combined with booming bomb beats, you will like this!"
5,"Some of Pun's, I Mean Fat Joe's Best Work","This album is so good it kinda sounds like Pun wrote it, oh that's right Pun did write the whole album. Don't believe me just compare this album to J.O.S.E and Loyalty you'll hear the difference."
4,I Can Dig This.,"Fat Joe is back with a new sound; there are some hot tracks on here even though there are some poor ones too. The hottest track is definitely ""John Blaze"", which features Nas, Big Punisher, Jadakiss, and Raekwon. The poorest track is ""Make Sh*t Better"". The track ""Good Times"", with Bone is real good. ""Don Cartagena"" isn't that bad, but Puffy ruins it. It still isn't bad, though. ""My World"" and ""All Love"" are really good. This album is good, nothing spectacular, but GOOD."
1,boo im hatin joe r u,if u think im cooler then fate joe say this reveiw was chelpful if not say it wasnt peace
4,joey crack is mad nice!,This is joey cracks best cd and shows just how good he and the terror squad are gonna be to bad that big pun will not be thier for the ride [rip] go and pick this album up$$
4,Dont sleep on TS,"fat joe can no longer claim to be th best latin rapper. the best tracks on this cd are all laced with Terror Squad. Cuban gonna blow up even bigger than fat jiddoe when he drops, possibly big pun status. dont sleep. just check ""terror squadrians"""
1,What is hip hop coming to?,"Why is it that every rapper all of a sudden thinks he's in the mafia? They put out a couple of CD's and all of a sudden they're a Don or they think they're Scarface. Hell, why don't they just bite off big silly Star Wars. Fat Joe could be Jabba the hut, Master P could be Darth Vader and Puff Daddy could be Luke Skywalker."
4,fat joe is an artist that has been under rated for many year,"Fat Joe, AKA Don Cartagena, has finnally received some long due recognition as a real street minded rap musician. Fat Joe's new founded level of sucess is due to the debut of Big Pun, a friend of Joe's. A new fan of Joe's may want to look back to Jealous One's Envy for not equal, but rap of the same style. I have been a joe fan for years and I am happy that he made it large, I like to see the videos. Just one thing, why puff daddy? I will say the same thing I said when puff daddy appeared on KRS1's more recent album, why? Record sales may boost a little for this album but what does that do for the long term hip hop fans that respect the music so much? I'll tell you what, we lose a little respect. And that is what cartagena is all about, right? e logan, Boston MA"
4,HOT TO DEATH,"FAT JOE IS TRULY THE LYRICAL DON OF THE BOOGIE DOWN BRONX. HE HAS TIGHT BEATS,CAMEOS,AND LYRICS.THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ALL HIP-HOP HEADS!"
3,A decent album,"Fat Joe is pretty good, but I don't really dig his style. This album is decent. It deserves three starz, but none more."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I was all set to enjoy a classic mystery. I couldn't do it. The setting was the usual sojourn in the country with innumerable suspects. The characters were stock. I couldn't keep them straight, and I had no interest in doing so. Maybe I would have enjoyed the book if I could have stuck it out to the end, but it wasn't worth it."
5,The Best of Sakamoto - Almost,"Contains a lot of Sakamoto classics like the funky ""Neo Geo"" and a symphony soundtrack piece from ""The Last Emperor"", all within a collection featuring a creative sequence that goes from one genre to another. There is some new work that is particularly strong, like the driving house-influenced ""Anger - Rare Force 2 Meg Mix"" and the calm (yet tense) Bossa Nova / Alva Noto ambient mix ""Insensatez"", which finishes the CD. The five videos on the accompanying disc are well-done and show Sakamoto at different stages of his career, including a precious early live performance of ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"". Since Sakamoto has too much tremendous work to fit on one compilation CD, it's not surprising that a lot of significant work is left out, like anything from what I consider his best CD, ""Smoochy"", and the best song from his ""BTTB"" CD - ""Aqua"". But that's more of a compliment. I thoroughly enjoy ""Moto.Tronic""."
2,Made in China. Burn failed usning itune. Poor quality.,"I have a lot of these discs that I bought several years ago which were made in Japan. They never failed. So when itune complained that the disc needs to be calibrated when the burn failed. I was truly surprised. It is made in China (marked above UPC code). I paid premium price for this kind of junk. Even the Memorex discs I bought in Walmart (made in Taiwan) are much better than these. BTW, I ordered CD-R (PHOTO) PRO but received CD-R PRO."
4,I believe my pack was old.,"I've bought the gold ones and they were great. But this time they were blue and the first one didn't write. only 40 x speed on these blue ones also. So ask the seller which color they have, ask for the gold ones."
1,NO LONGER MADE IN JAPAN! now made in CHINA! CAUTION,"I just recieved 5 sets of these 25pk maxell cdr pro. I am very sad to say they are GARBAGE!!! heres why:-just the print is not even and smudged on the cd's, unbelievable!-there are many artifacts/imperfections on the cd media side, this can guarantee caused cd errors-each of the packs i opend all had small particles, pieces of plastic floating around on all the discs and spindlesthese floating peices of plastic, god forbid if they go into your cd/dvd drive will ruin the drive-the ink on the CD's use to be a strong Phthalocyanin dye (deep dark green) now they are POOR off the shelf cheap cd dye'sI am very sad to see such a great product ruined.DO NOT BUY THESE, TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! i would give it negative star rating if possibleTHIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MADE IN CHINA!!!if you need a good cd and can spend the money just get gold delkins already."
1,"Cheap chinese ripoffs, NOT Made In Japan anymore!!","I just received these & found the same problem as the previous reviewer. These used to be top quality made in Japan by Taiyo Yuden. Now they're just overpriced cheap Riteks in disguise. I had this item in my cart for over a year prior to the last review. If I'd read it, I would have deleted this item. I feel totally ripped off & I've learned my lesson (read the latest reviews before finally ordering!).Don't waste your money. These are good for disposable use only, not for archiving your family photos ect."
3,Maxell CD-R Pro no longer Taiyo Yuden,"I was disappointed to find that Maxell's CD-R Pro discs are no longer rebadged Taiyo Yuden discs with the blueish ""super cyanine"" dye. The outer package has a paper sticker over the UPC indicating ""Made In Taiwan"" but I opened the cake anyway. Yes, they are generic Maxell discs by Ritek. Makes me wonder about the archival claims on the outer wrapper which, by the way, has ""Made In Japan"" printed under the UPC oversticker. Perhaps now that T-Y is owned by JVC they did not want competing branding?These discs will be okay for data use but only T-Y discs will play without skipping in my car stereo. C'est la vie."
5,Sweet!,I'm very happy with these discs.I've had no problems with them and Iwould highly recommend them to anyone lookingfor awesome discs!
3,Not pro audio gold media.,"These CD-R are no different from other Maxell CD-R, as far as I can say. Even though they are priced the same as professional grade Gold CD-Rs, they are not. They are not suitable for mastering or mixdown purposes. These may be suitable for business professionals who wish to reliably store data for a hundred years without degredation, but they are not suitable for professional audio applications, despite what their name may suggest."
5,"Great, Great Product!!",I truly think the Maxell Cd-r pros are the best blanks on the market!! Nothing can compare to it!! I've been using these for quite sometime and never let down!!
2,Smell is awful and not good for fragrance-sensitive skin,"I used this on the recommendation of a family member whose dermatologist had recommended this and they were having great results. I, on the other hand, did not have such great results. For one, this does not have glycolic acid like the other Glytone products. It's just salcylic acid. The fragrance is awful and for someone like me, who gets bad breakout reactions along the jawline just from certain fragrances, this is a bad combo. My face was broken out the entire time I used it and began clearing up when I stopped."
1,Not worth a penny,"I bought this when I ran out of my other (more expensive) acne-clearing toner. I read about 100 reviews on other sites and everybody said it worked like a charm. I used it twice a day in conjunction with a well-known acne cleanser, then a another store-bought acne cleanser (when I ran out of the expensive cleanser) AND while taking birth control and I still suffered with five or six nasty pimples on any given day. It was a waste. I've used a full two-thirds of the bottle now and there is zero improvement in my skin. My skin looked markedly better (though still not always clear) when I was using the other toner and cleanser together, so I dropped the money on those tonight instead."
4,Great Toner,"Works well on the skin, my face looked and felt fresh. You might break out in the first few times, but after that, the pimples stopped. It helped control my acne for over a month now!"
4,Great cleanser,"The formula in this cleanser is very good. My skin is generally dry, with some oil around my nostrils. This cleanser had no problem cleaning both the dry and oily areas, leaving them equal and clean. It has an adequate amount of foam and ability to lift. I have tried a lot of face cleansers and this is the best, with the exception of the packaging. The bottle is quite heavy and is opaque. So their is no real way to tell if you are running out until you do."
5,"Great price, great camera","I've been very impressed so far with all the features that I've used - the optical zoom that allows the extreme close-up shot without fuzziness, the quickness of how it's ready to take the photo in less than 2 seconds after turning it on, the easy shutter menu for which I haven't had to read the manual yet. But to get to all the other features, I will have to read it... soon! Until then, I'm having fun playing with my camera! And the best part was the great deal - I haven't found this camera for less anywhere else."
4,Good picture quality but slow,"I had minolta dimage before this.And i got this after that with more pixels and zoom. The quality of picture are no doubt great . Canon knows what they are making . The only cons i have found so far is slow shutter speed. It takes long time to store picture (upto 4 sec). Which is some time frustrating in parties? You wait to get ready for another picture. The click button is lot of time slow too, you need to push it hard to make it work.I hope this helps user to pick right camera."
4,"Does its job. Cheap, effective.",I bought it with the goal of controlling it from a computer. It doesn't have the flexibility of some other cameras for this purpose. But it works.
1,WORST CAMERA EVER,"Eats rechargeable batteries very fast - takes about 7 pictures before camera dies. And when it dies, the zoom does not retract. Very frustrating camera."
4,good item for easy use,"good price, very useful, hand carry okbut slow sutter, dark lensenow sertisfy"
1,This camera is an overpriced POS.,"I bought this camera March 1, 2005 from Best Buy, brand new (with a protection plan, thank god). On the 14th, it gave me an E18 error, and I returned the camera -- it was exchanged for a new one. Today, I received an E30 error. What do these E errors mean? God only knows -- it's not even listed in the manual.The focusing on this camera is disgusting, if you've ever used a ""manual"" camera. It does not focus on the correct object 50% of the time.Battery life is a complete joke. Expect to spend the price of the camera on batteries within the first six months of purchase. I've been through five sets of the AAs, rechargable and non, alike. The LCD screen depletes these batteries even worse, don't use it.I never even had a chance to explore the full uses of this camera -- it broke everytime I tried. I'm returning this for something reasonable!"
1,Camera is okay for beginners and non computer literates,Canon cannot make a camera that is not proprietary to their lousy software. You must load up their software in order to get the pictures off the card or else buy a card reader. When you plug it in it launches the Canon ZoomBrowser software. This software in its latest versions above 5.0 has the following big drawbacks:You do not see a Removable Media Drive like you do with cameras like those from Olympus. You also CANNOT...I repeat CANNOT copy the photos from the camera to any type of a non local hard drive using their terrible software or drivers which makes these horrible for a business environment because you must copy everything local and then manually move them around.We already rolled these out at my employer or I would have suggested that all 13 of them that we purchased be sent back as junk.As for the camera itself it is okay but I would personally never buy one.
3,Canon a510,"I bought this camera of Amazon. When I received the camera, the box wasn't sealed. The camera is nice, and it does have a lot of options. The sad part was that when I received it, I received a damaged item because the camera kept telling me that the batteries are dead and it kept shutting off. Amazon sent me the replacement, so hopefully once ill receive the new one I will fully enjoy it."
1,ok camera...rebate declined?!,I bought this with the iP4000R Wireless Photo Printer to get the $70 rebate for the 2 items together. I never got the rebate and after contacting Canon for a month they tell me they never got the box tabs. Of course I sent them with the rebate form. So now I have no boxes and no rebate. Very aggravating and disappointing!
5,great camera...as reviewed by others,"i read all the reviews on this and many other digital cameras, here on amazon and other sites, and am very pleased with my purchase. it doesn't seem to have any drawbacks as yet. excellent little camera."
3,Sloooow. No good for kids photos.,"Did extensive research before we bought this camera, so surprised and disappointed. Might be OK for static subjects, but we bought to take photos of our kids, and this is just no good for that. The shutter lag is interminable, and thus we never get the shot we want, even when set at the kids and pets setting.We put a rubber band around our old Nikon Coopix 1000 and are using that again. Much quicker. Who needs all those pixels for snapshots unless you're printing large photos. With the 1 megapixel you get thousands of photos on a small memory card, and the photos send much quicker via email/web.If you're shooting kids, don't waste your money - save up until you're ready to spend enough to get a camera with no shutter lag -- and be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars on memory cards."
2,"Canon A510 ""service""","Bought the camera as a gift. My son-in-law used it less than three weeks and it would not turn on. He is in Iraq and sent it home. I contacted Canon and sent it in. The turn around time was less than two weeks. It works now but they scratched it badly around the screws used to disassemble the camera and added an extra one on the display for free. Poor, poor repair. Just beware of Canon ""service"". I'm a long time Canon user myself and own 7 film and digital cameras and have had good luck with all of them but be very afraid of their ""service""."
2,Canon A510 camera...From L. Orr.,I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended??
2,Shutter jams,"I bought this for my son and within a few days, the shutter jammed. He was still able to use the camera by manually pushing the shutter open. He really liked it except for the shutter problem, until he dropped it in the river. He is waiting for it to dry out. If it survives this, I'll change the rating."
4,"Excellent camera, not ""top of the line"" but nice.","Good camera. Not the best, but a good value for the price. It's a camera I'd recommend to non-pros and the novice."
2,Canon Powershot A510 negatives,"I bought the Canon Powershot A510 two years ago and was very happy with the quality of pictures. However, during the past several months I noticed that my battery charge was not lasting as long as it should. I first blamed it on my charger and bought a new one. Its not the batteries or the charger, its the camera. It completely drains the batteries within seconds. The camera is now unusable and I probably won't buy another Canon camera."
2,"Maybe for a first camera, but not for a second...","I have owned a Powershot S200 for some years and loved it, but it finally gave up. I thought the A510 would be an upgrade...it is not. It is just as heavy and quite a bit larger. Night shots are very difficult to get right, and you can not trust the auto mode. It also has a less sturdy feel to it. Well I'm gpnna keep it but am certainly disappointed. As a first digital camera it is probably great, but if you are used to digital and are looking for an upgrade, this is probably not for you."
4,"Great camera, but lens has a bit of distortion","Overall, this is a great point-and-shoot digital camera. I'm not a photographer or an enthusiast, but the pictures I've taken with this camera look very good. The camera also comes with a sizable number of user-adjustable settings for those who want more control over their photos. Another big plus is the A510's use of SD cards and AA batteries, which make this a flexible and cheap camera to operate.On the downside, shutter speed is a bit slow in high-quality mode, which can be annoying when you're trying to capture an exact moment (blowing out candles, etc.). The only other downside I've noticed is that the lens tends to distort vertical lines, particularly toward the sides of the frame, more than other cameras I've used before. Despite these two issues, I'm glad I have this camera--it's a keeper."
5,Good value for General Photography,PowerShot A510 gives most of what you expect from a digital camera for a lesser price. Since it runs on 2 AA batteries you don't have to worry too much about batteries. Of course you are better off using AA rechargebles if you want to save a little money on batteries !
3,great camera for real estate but not for personal life,"This camera takes awesome quality pictures. I'm a realtor I use this camera mainly for shooting homes. It gives me professional image quality for work, but I tried taking pictures after work, portraits shooting & it's too slow for portrait taking. the capture is slow & if using the flash it takes the camera a while to reset itself, so by the time you take the shot, your subject moves your end picture is blurred. So I only think if you are taking pictures that are not moving or have your subjects stand there like a rock you're fine. Otherwise get another camera."
5,No disappointment,"I've had this camera for about 5 years now and I've used it in all kinds of situations, including night clubs, traveling, day/night, carnivals, etc. I have to say I have never been disappointed in the picture quality that this camera offers. The zoom is pretty amazing and the pictures come out great when you use it. The colors are quite true and, if you are anything like me sometimes, it allows you to have somewhat of a shaky hand and still take a focused picture.My boyfriend has a 'Nikon Coolpix S3' and when it comes to taking pictures at night, he just asks to use mine because his always come out blurry.It's definitely a product that holds up as time passes by, and gives Canon a good name when it comes to the quality of their digital cameras."
1,Received two defective units,"I purchased this camera because of its high ratings, but after one day, the lens cover began sticking. I returned it for a replacement. One day after receiving the replacement, the problem surfaced on the second unit. Canon needs to fix this problem."
2,Flash recycle way too long,"I used this camera for 3 days, and returned it back (to Amazon) yesterday.Why I returned it:- Everytime you take a picture with flash, the camera displays the picture for 3 seconds, after which it goes blank for 8-10 seconds. You can not take another picture till that time.- It takes 3-4 seconds to achieve focusSo imagine you're taking a picture of your kid cutting his birthday cake, and someone stepped right into your frame... you can not take another picture till 8-12 seconds until the flash is recharged, and it tries to focus again. By that time, the scene and moment are gone.I used to own a Canon A75 before (and a Canon A70 before that), so I'm a hard-core Canon user. But I am very disappointed with this camera. I would advise folks to check other forums on digital camera sites and then decide if they want to buy this camera or not. The user reviews are not pretty."
1,Go bad too soon,I purchased a 510 PowerShot in summer of 2005. After couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. I cound't take any picture anymore. I contacted Canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix.
2,The Not-Sturdy Sweeper,"The sweeping part of this Bissell works just fine but as many other reviewers have noted, the handle falls apart if you breathe on it wrong. My husband actually screwed the sections of the handle itself together but now it separates at the point where the handle meets the sweeper. And don't bother reading the directions about how to put this together. The handle problem persists no matter what you do.I'd recommend getting down to your local chain store (as much as I dislike recommending any of them for anything) and get a carpet sweeper with a handle that's in one piece. This one is not worth the hassle."
1,Worthless on hardwood floors,"The other reviews convinced me this product was what I was looking for - quick and easy cleanups in between major vacuuming. I unpacked it as soon as I got it and tried it out on the cracker crumbs on our hardwood floor left from lunch. What it would pick up was only the smallest of crumbs, and even some of those it just brushed around on the floor. I decided to return it immediately. Problem now is getting the handle unassembled to repack."
1,Can't even use this--------,I ordered this sweeper to pick up after my granddaughters withouthaving to take out the vacuum.What a mistake!This is so poorly made. The problem is that the handle does not stay on.When you push it the handle comes off in your hand. I tried everything to fix it with no luck.Would not recommend this.
1,awful,The handel falls apart - kinda picks up dirt - i would not purchase this again Bissell 2402B Sturdy Sweep Sweeper
3,Bissell Sweeper hard to handle,this Bissell sweeps just fine but the handle doesn't lay down easily. It may after some months of use but right now it snaps rather hard when you try to lean the handle down to clean.
1,carpet sweater,I was not pleased with this product. The sweeping area is too small. The rubber hose detached. I would not reccommend this product.
3,DOESN'T DO HARDWOOD FLOORS,"Despite the promo image showing this thing sweep over carpet and hardwood, it does NOT do well on hard floors. I expressly wanted something to pick up cheerios from hardwood floor, and this simply pushes them around. Seems to work fine on the limited carpet testing I did."
3,Bissell floor sweeper,Works great except the handles keep comming apart. Took duct tape and taped them together and they are fine.
1,Buy a Sweeper at a Thrift Store!!!!,"I had done quite a bit of research on carpet sweepers...I thought I had looked at some ok reviews on this sweeper. it is awful. it is loud, moves things around on the floor, whether it is carpet or tile. Didn't work worth a lick. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in bissell. Please don't waster your money. If you can go to a garage sale or a thrift store, get one of the old ones that just pick up everything, you only have to go over an area once and you don't have to pick the stuff up yourself.this sweeper has two rows of brushes and rubber at each corner. it didn't pick up anything and the noise it made was as loud as a small vacuum...horrible, DO NOT BUY IT."
2,"cheap, disappointing","I've had carpet sweepers before and was looking forward to getting a Bissell which I'd heard was the best around. Big disappointment. sorry but this one's cheaply made and doesn't do as good a job as the $20 no-name product I had before. The dual bristles and side bristles add nothing. The 3-part push-together handle keeps falling apart even tho I re-installed it according to the directions 3 times. ""Sturdy"" it is not. I do NOT recommend this product."
4,Bissell Carpet Sweeper,"We were tired of lugging out our vacuum cleaner to get crumbs and dust off the carpet in our dining/kitchen area. The sweeper does the job almost as well. The same is true for bare floors. The sweeper does need emptying after almost every sweep or else will not do the job so well. Others have mentioned the handle sections separating. This happened to us but since we used a hammer to bang them into each other, we haven't had a problem. Added bonus: our two-and-a-half year old grandson loves to sweep for us."
2,Barely Functional,"This sweeper is more like a child's toy than an adult's tool. It works only when pushed in the forward direction and barely does the job for small quick pick-ups. (If you pull it toward yourself, it just jumps all over the place and spills what little it has picked up.) My husband dislikes it even more than I do. Would not recommend unless purchased for a child."
3,Bissel Sturdy Sweep,This product works as advertised. My only issue is that the handle will not stay together. I am planning on glueing it together becuase no matter how hard I push to keep it together it pulls apart.
2,Dirt Pusher??,"I am very disappointed with THE BISSELL STURDY SWEEP SWEEPER. It does not perform well, at all. I can sweep over a small bit of paper 15-20 times before I actually need to bend down and pick it up by hand. It pushes dirt around the floor before sweeping it up. It's a total waste of time on carpets and does absolutely nothing! I went with Bissell because of its good name. I expected a reliable product that I could depend on. This is not it! I am not at all happy with this purchase!"
2,Big disappointment on dog hair,"I wanted a quick way to freshen the white carpeting (came with the house) without dragging out the big vacuum. I remembered using a Hokie way back when I was a chambermaid. But this ain't it.It worked acceptably on bare floors but no great performance. One the rug, it pushed the dog hair so it would pile it. It would have been funny looking if I hadn't waited so long to get the sweeper and then, had to send it back."
1,waste of money,it fell apart the first time we used it. the handle didnt stay attached to the bottom part of the unit.
1,:(,Handle keeps coming apart when you try to use this sweeper. Very annoying to use because of that. Does not clean that great either.
5,great sweeper,I really like this sweeper and it is not very heavy which makes it fun to use. It works well.
2,buy a swivel sweeper instead!,it works good on carpet and it is definatly only for in between vacuming. save your money and go with the swivel sweeper; its cheaper and runs on a motor and works soooo much better.
1,Bissel Study Sweep Only Goes Straight,"The picture made me think the cleaner would turn like the swivel sweeper but it doesn't. If you try, it will break. Bah!"
1,i really wish this sweeper worked properly but it just doesnt,I really wish this sweeper worked properly but it just doesn't. All the reviews about the stick falling apart are true. I do not see how it is possible to enjoy using this sweeper when the stick always coming apart. You have connect about 4 pieces of metal to create the metal pole which connects the little sweeper to the handle but within a minute of normal use it falls apart and does not stay together.For the few seconds it did stay together it did clean my rug pretty well however it is completely useless for ceramic tiles. I didn't try it on hard wood floors however based on the terrible performance on ceramic tiles I bet it would be useless on hard wood floors.
2,"does the job, but CHEAP HANDLE BREAKS","This does clean up hair, dirt etc on the carpet really well.On the third use the handle kept coming apart.Have put it together with electrical tape, but the bottom still comes out....Totally annoying. Bissel really could fix this problem quite easily and should."
3,carpet sweeper,A good quality light weight sweeper. Works well on hard floors and short nap carpets but not well on longer nap carpet.
4,Works for it's intended purpose,"Got this sweeper to use for quick, small pickups when getting the vacuum cleaner out and plugging it up would be too much hassle. It is better quality than a previous sweeper I used to own since the handles now screw into each other. I no longer have to worry about the handle falling apart. Does it work as well as a vacuum? No, but it isn't intended to. It was created for a certain purpose and does a good job."
2,Bissell sweeper,"I wanted tis sweeper mostly for my kitchen floor. Turned out to not pick up well on bare floors. It is good on carpets though. Try a more expensive one, I would say, if your need is as mine"
3,Works well on carpet not on tile,It is great for sweeping up bird food and stuff but does not work at all on the tile in the foyer.
1,Peach Tea,"4C Ice Tea Mix, Peach, 28 Quart, 74.2-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3)This had no taste of Peach at all. Returned for refund."
4,Effcee,"I really loved Disc 1. It's something you have to turn up loud and dance to. The songs are really catchy, and well written, with excellent beats and addictive vocals (a real breath of fresh air).Disc 2 really didn't impress me at all, and I don't think I'll be listening to it much. It's the only reason this review got 4 stars instead of 5.This is worth the buy for Disc 1 alone, trust me! If you're hesitant, you can always buy a used copy. I did, and mine came in perfect condition."
2,Get this CD if you like tribute bands.,"You know those karaoke section of the record store? You know what most karaoke music sound like right? cheesy versions of the original played/sung by some poor under paid musician? Well, this CD is for you... the entire second disk is a remix of 80's music without the wit and the bite of 2 Many DJs, Miss Kittin, Ladytron, Larry Tee or Felix Da Housecat. I bought this CD because ""Destroy All Djs"" by Bp Vs Effcee was actually okay and I was looking for more of the same."
5,Pie Crust,I used my original pie crust recipe but substituted part tapioca flour and part gluten free bread flour for a pumpking pie. Those family members that ate the pie made with the gluten free products and the traditional pie could not taste any difference between the two.
2,"Gripping, Unfortunately","It had seemed like a good book when I had started reading it, but, no, it wasn't, and for a lot of different reasons. The first (and probably the most annoying) is the way the author sets this character up: in a good story, you'd want to make your audience sad when they die. When Mordred died, I was very happy. When Arthur lived, I was disappointed. When Mordred didn't die, I wondered what the point of the story was. To make everyone hate Mordred? Um, that's already happened, Miss Springer. The second, is its details, which were not only boring, but pointless. The third, is that I couldn't stop reading it. Really, I wanted to rush this over to the nearest recycling center, but the book won't relieve you of its awfulness. If ever you concider this book, DON'T READ IT! I'd never read a bad book until I read I AM MORDRED."
1,There is no longer a line between good and evil...,"IT wasn't that this book was poorly written or that it was totally bad. It's just the author has taken both heros and villians and turned the tables completely around.In all the other books I have read, Mordred is an evil, treacherous villian no better than his half sister, the witch Morgan le Fay. Here he is portrayed as merely confused and scared. I for one am also scared. We have lost the boundry between good and evil and when that boundry is taken away people begin to really think good is evil and evil is good. And when that happens, total anarchy ensues.I highly recommend that you DO NOT read this book as well as it's counterpart ""I am Morgan Le Fay"". THe philosophy is too dangerous to get involved in.HOwever, if you're looking for a great story from Camelot I highly recommend ""KIng Arthur and His KNights"" By ANthony MOckler. I have read many king Arthur books and by far this is the best out there. At least someone can get the story right!"
4,Mordred tries to conquer fate with a twist of evil all over,"I thought the book was good.I'm 11 years old, and thought that there was a lot of description and detail. There was also a lot of gore and bloody scenes. It is very sad at the end, but I really lked the book. It is very entertaining and makes you want t o keep reading. A real page turner."
5,This is a real mind twister!!,I think this book was the greatest. It sucks you in and makes you want to keep reading. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to read about King Aurther. This book makes you feel sorry for Mordred. At the end you will have tears in your eyes.
2,I Am Mordred,"I Am Mordred, by Nancy SpringerIn ""I Am Mordred,"" Springer recounts the life of King Arthur's illegitimate son, the son who will kill him. Mordred's typically gotten a bad rap or been ignored in Authurian stories, and Springer takes a different approach and tries to show what led to him killing Arthur.Because Mordred was conceived by Arthur and his half-sister, he was considered morally evil as soon as he was born. Springer examines Mordred through the lens of today, where most people assume children are born innocent. In this book, Mordred is an ordinary teen, struggling to come to terms with learning who his parents are, sibling rivalry, and the feeling that he doesn't quite fit in.I thought the premise was interesting, but the book doesn't stand out much for me. It's a book I read, momentarily enjoyed, and forgot a few days later. I'd recommend this for fans of Aurthruian tales, or anyone interested in Mordred.2/5."
3,Arthurian Mythos,"This book focuses on Sir Mordred, Arthur's only son to his sister Morgana. It is a worthy read for would be Knights of the Round Table. In Excalibur, it is Mordred who causes Arthur's downfall to a final fated duel. In the process, he kills most of Arthur's knights single handedly or with the aid of his own minions of evil. A so so look at Artur's son. I rented it at a local library."
3,It's Ok,For $40 it is not worth it. There is 201 pokemon on it and mini games. It gives good descriptions but it is too expensive. Wait for the price to lower.
5,pokefreak,"this was ALOT better than the last pokedex and with a few minor adustments (such as sound off, and adusting the screen you can do these both in options.) its perfect (if only i waited for the price drop)"
1,ZERO STARS!!! This Item SUCKS! (for lack of a better word),"I have bought 2 of these and BOTH broke in less than 5 minutes. The first one's battery fell out as soon as my son started playing with it and his grandfather assumed he would just put the battery back in, but it didn't fix it. The screen went blank and it did not work after that. It still doesn't. Then I thought it was a ""dud"" Pokedex so I bought another one for my son. He played it for about 2 minutes and all the sudden the screen froze and it started making a clicking and humming sound. I took out the battery in hopes to ""refresh"" the Pokedex and even after taking the battery out it STILL made the noises!! So I put the battery back in, but it didn't fix it. For 2 months the clicking and humming sounds went on and on and on. I wasted $60.00 on these pieces of junk!)@(#!"
3,"Not much fun, but the alarm function comes in handy","When I got this, I expected a lot more. The mini games and capture mode are okay, but they get boring after a while. I don't play with it often, I only use the alarm function to get me up early enough so I'm not late for school."
4,Kaiba's (Yes... Real name...) review for this item.,"I am a pokemon fan, but this kinda disappointed me. The cover easily breaks off and the maker seemed to have a thing for red. Tip: Shut off the sound. IF you don't, you will go deaf. Actually, this isn't as bad as I said. Those things are trivial compared to the fun you'll have with this thing. you can catch pokemon and it looks nearly exactly like the one the TV Characters use. I enjoy this. I give this an above average 4 out of 5."
1,$50 for a toy? No kid is worth that. O.o,"Why do you think they invented the Pokemon games for Gameboy?Besides it's 50 bucks. It's at least $25. DON'T BUY IT, unless it goes down in price. Very low."
1,Sad,"I saved up for this toy my whole entire life i earned 30 dollars of hard work and spent the rest of my life savings for college and when i bought the pokedex i knew i had been ""ripped off"" and i didn't even fell like doing anything so i advise you to buy it until it is only $10. Because now my life is wasted."
1,Gotta trash em' all!,"wow! this toy is crap! throw it away today! i think your company should make a blow up pokemon so that my 6 yr old son can punch it without having to hurt himself. actually, i want one of your workers to come to my house and patch up all the holes in my walls! good thing is it's built strong to burn long. i think i'll buy one every time we go camping! well, CRAP got to go-my son's punching another whole in the wall!"
2,Not worth the hype,"I bought it on sale for $20 and it was still overprice. It feels like something you would get out of a kid's meal at a fast food restaurant. The graphics are very simple (black and white) and on the mini games sometimes hard to see. We even had troubles setting it up because the directions are not very clear. Yes you can track your favorite characters and see some stats, but even my seven year old's said it looked cooler on TV. In fact it has been sitting in a drawer since about two days after we got it. I would truly suggest passing this one over."
5,Best Toy,"This toy is one of the best toys my kids have gotten. The price was just a little bit high. But besides that, I love it!"
2,Waste of money...,"This Pokedex isn't at all what I expected it to be. A Pokedex is meant to be a Pokemon encyclopedia, used for checking information on Pokemon. This, however, has games, incorrect information, and a screensaver. Honestly, why does it need a screensaver? I doubt anyone's going to be playing with it for that long, if they play with it at all. Normally it goes for about 30 bucks. I got mine for 5 bucks, and would gladly have my money back. It has only the advanced generation Pokemon, no National Dex programmed into it, and they have stupid errors! For instance, spelling Sandshrew ""Sabdshrew"". Overall a stupid game with low replayability. Stick with the games if you want to have fun."
3,"""Calm Baby"" is better!!","This is a good DVD but ""Calm Baby"" is way better. It does not capture my daughter's attention like Calm Baby does...she is bored after 15 minutes."
3,"Cheap Mug, Quality shovel.",The mug fell onto the grass and broke day 1. The shovel is sturdy and it has a nice handle.
2,time consuming,"Easy enough to use, but after a week I still wasn't sleeping (this process takes several weeks) I just wanted to get to sleep like a normal person, and this was not helping. I ended up getting the nightwave sleep assistant and it worked in 3 days. It's also cheaper. One thing that I wanted to mention is that when I bought this, I read all of the reviews (there were only 4, I think) and they were all glowing reviews. After I got this and felt that it wasn't so great, I checked the reviews again, and the people's other reviews, I realized that they only wrote reviews for lifekey products, so they obviously were not impartial. I learned my lesson and now I always check the person's other reviews! Everyone probably knows that, but this is my first purchase here. Oh well...you win some you lose some........."
2,transmits ok,It does the job it is designed to do but I keep forgetting to turn it off so the batteries keep running down. I had to replace it with transmitter that had dc plug in adapter
2,DOESN'T CONNECT WELL TO THE IPAQ 6515,"I bought this so I could play my music from my IPAQ 6515 PDA/PHONE over my car radio. Due to the cell phone it has a mini audio jack so it required an additional adapter which it came with. However, It was almost impossible to keep the plug connected properly.I've used it for my IPOD which has a standard headphone jack and it worked OK.For me it wasn't worth the hassle or money"
1,Poor Reception and Very Sensetive,"I have used this product several times and have not yet had it work without static coming over the radio. Each time I used it there was substantial interference after just a song or two played.Also, if the unit moves or is moved during play, the player creates static or simply does not play."
1,Eh...Not so great,Doesn't work so good (lots of static) and the cord where you plug in the Mp3 player broke and i had to fix it with electrical tape.
1,YAKMALLAH!,"Going based only on the movie made from this book (Gymkata), I would have to say this is completely unacceptable reading."
4,The original Buck Rogers Novel,"This is where ""Buck"" Rogers first appeared. He's just Anothony Rogers, a WWI vet who sleeps for 400 years. He awakes to find American under occupation and leads the fight for their freedom."
4,Big tank!,"Got this for Skirmish Invasion of Normandy. Its a huge tank, and its tough, I ran through a full hopper and around 6 pods of paint with my x-7 with out running out of air, so most markers will have no issue. The only problem I had with this was, its a huge tank. It didn't fit in my normal pod pack, and I had to find one that it would actually work with, and second, its really heavy, so even if your not using a remote line this thing is going to tire you out."
2,"Good tank, leaky regulator","The tank was great once we got the leaking regulator fixed. Aparently when it was assembled, the threads were stripped."
4,Its ok.,"If your going to buy this tank you got to buy a remote coil with it because its just to heavy, trust me with your gun fully loaded and this thing on it, trust me buy a remote coil!!!!!!!!!!!ooo and one more thing if you dont want to wait a long time for it dont buy from dorosports they just take too long but if your cool on waiting go ahead."
4,Great tank buy!,"Great price, easy to use, quick fill is conveniently placed, tank gauge very accurate. Tank is a little heavy (comparable to a 20oz CO2)-really recommend a remote. This is not a HPA tank for running right on a marker. CAN'T beat the price for the size and quality of the tank!"
3,Great tank if you're a body builder,"Good quality, large capacity, and VERY HEAVY. It was so heavy in fact I returned it and bought two aluminum Pure Energy 48ci/3000psi tanks."
4,"wow, big boy.","It doesnt seems so big in the picture, but... IT IS BIG, man. Its like u are carrying a scuba by your self (joking), but no harness will fit this, I had to modify my harness to put this tank on. Has a great performance for long time shooting, so if u wanna do recreational paintball its a good option, just make sure is what u really want."
4,Big Tank-Low Price,This one is a no brainer. If you want a large HPA tank but don't want to fork over 100+ bucks than this is the tank for you.ProsBig and CheapConsBig and Heavy. Best bet is to run it with a remote.
4,Beast of a Tank,"This is honestly a beast of a tank it is very sturdy, and holds a large amount of air. it is also extremely heavy, i cannot even attach it to my ion because it will mess up the screws. with a coil however and a backpack or however you want to carry it its great! especially if you dont get free air refills or have to travel for your air."
4,"Good tank, good price","This tank is just like any other tank except what caught my eye was the price tag. It's a little on the heavy side (obviously) because of the size. But for woodsballers (with milsim markers) who go 20oz and up for CO2 and 50ci and up for HPA should think of remote coil anyway. I got this in hopes of one day doing a war game that will last for more than a day. I don't want to leave the field just to fill in the tank every 500 shots or so.For those who play all day or shoot more than a case of paint a day, get the bigger tanks such as this one. With the right harness, it's more convenient over all than not."
3,"Works fine, but weighs a ton","This is a fine working Air Tank, save for one fact. It weighs so much that it strips the screws holding my regulater to my marker. Beyond that, if you fill her up, you're set for all day. I'd recommend it for anyone with some good upper arm strength, the frail need not apply, especially if your marker weighs 8 pounds or more."
4,Nice Tank,"The Pure Energy N2 Compressed Air Tank (72ci/3000psi) was a good purchase in my opinion. I didn't want to spend too much for a tank, and I also didn't want to constantly refill. This tank was a decent price and I only had to refill 2 times for a time of 5 hours of playing, not bad. This tank is really big, so I recommend a Remote line coil, other wise you can do what I do, and just use it as a stock. It is comfortable to me, I am a big guy, so weight doesn't bother me, but my cousin who went with me said my gun overall was too heavy, and he is kinda ripped. The only problem I had with this was the shipper...It took them 3 weeks to ship this to me, I think it came from Louisiana, and I am from California, but that's not relevant to the performance of this can."
2,UUUUGGGGHHHH!!! THIS IS NOT ART,"I Found this story to be the tale of a self-indulgent, self absorbed, and truly arrogant man. Tonio Kroger is an unhappy soul who hides behind the claim of being an artist. How can one put down and demean the people he wishes to be like? Tonio is the victim of poor self esteem that could be easily escapable if he would only see that he is the cause of all his ""suffering"". As you all can see, I was not particularly fond of this selection but I give two stars anyway due to the fact that I only had to put it down 10 times while I was reading it rather than the 25 that normally accompanies this sort of reading."
2,Not her greatest performance,"With all of the wonderful violin DVDs available, I found this one a disappointment and a waste of time.I've seen Anne-Sophie Mutter in person, which provided a better performance, but as for DVDs of violin performers, try Nadja Solerna Solnenberg or Nigel Kennedy and enjoy some real passion."
5,"An Industry Standard, A Must Have","If you're serious about working as a voiceover artist, you must have this book in your collection. It's written by one of the top voiceover coaches in the business James Alburger."
2,"Sloppy, inattentive to detial, repetative, some good info, though","Has some good information in it. It's written in simple, accessible prose. But, honestly, there were so many typos within the first few pages, that I started getting distracted and looking for them. It's also quite repetitive, reiterating, rather than adding to a point or topic. (i.e. ""take as many VO and acting classes as you can!"")"
5,Raise your voice to sing praises,"Another book with how to and step by step instructions on taking care of your voice, marketing yourself,and what to do and what not to do to get work. You couldn't ask for a more simple explanation of how to get started in voice acting. Of course the rest is up to you!"
5,This Book is a Must for Anyone Considering VO Work!,"This book is loaded with nuggets you will use in your career. James puts it all together nicely. This book contains great information on the shift from the ""announcer"" (voice of God) voiceover work of the past to the new style of ""voice acting"". This book is a must buy. I have used techniques from this book and have gotten rave reviews on demo material. I am looking forward to someday taking a class from James."
4,it was touching and informative,"i think that maclean has done a good job in describing fly fishing. it really inspired me to try it sometime. it seems to make fly fishing sound like a relaxing sport... it conveys many moods. i got a point of view from living in the woods, the mountains, etc.. roughing it.. and i realize how much harder it is than living my good ol city life. it didn't usually get boring but too much description about fly fishing got me confused at times but other than that, it was clearly understandable and readable. i'm glad i chose this book for my honors english reading... it was more of ""lesiure"" reading than ""forced"" reading."
5,4 count rhythm,"This book evokes a pastoral time and sport with wonderful imagery and genuine affection. It took Norman Maclean most of his life to write this and it seems he chose every word with great care. Rocks in the river are""from the basement of time."" Readers will be ""haunted by waters""."
3,CAN RELATE TO THE CLOSE FAMILY RELATIONSHIP,"In reading The River Runs Through It,for an assignment for English Comp. class for college,at the age of 52. I found that the book was slow and dull in the beginning ,but picked up with interesting reading, and I couldn't set the book down, untill I had finished it.As I read it for the second time, I could see alot more to the book then the first time and could relate to the family almost as if it were mine in growing up. It was the first book I had read in years, and would recomend it to any one who likes to read.There is so much more to the book the second time reading it, that after reading it I want to read more books along the same line."
3,Not bad. Movie is better.,"I learned to fish on the Blackfoot and know (the new) Lolo Hot Springs as well as MacLean. I enjoyed the thoughtfulness of his prose and his writing style, but found that his story wasn't particularly compelling. The movie was splendid, and anyone who has not seen Montana cannot create the beauty of Big Sky Country without seeing the movie. The best words of the book are spoken verbatim in the movie. See the film and save yourself the time of getting through the book."
2,Z-z-z-z-z,"If you think fly fishing is better than sex, this book is pornographic. Brilliant (I guess, what would I know?) expositions on the art and technique pad the story. Take these out, and it would be a good short story (or movie) for the non-fisherman. Non-fisherman who aren't looking for a good nap should see the movie instead. It's not bad."
1,Better than the movie?,"After thouroughly reading this book, I found that I enjoyed the movie version a lot better. At times I found my self un-interested in whst was going on. Some books don't use enough details, but in my opinion this book used a few too many. I feel that the book started off extremely slow, but got better towards the second half. I was also rather un-happy with the ending. If I could rate this book with negative stars, i would."
4,Norman Maclean,"Norman Maclean, seemingly a realist writer with the ideals of a dreamer, has really touched me with his words. In 'A River Runs Through It' he manages not only to touch us with his own story and view of the people around him, but has incorporated the most endearing people into his story. He gives us a bit of insight into those people and what exactly makes them tick. It's a book about Montana, a book about brothers, fishing, preaching, life, and a book about loving those who we dont' always understand. And getting to know those people a bit better... and seeing that they may not always understand us. I really loved it."
3,"Tastes alright, nothing special",The low carb chai tastes alright... is the best that I can say for it. It doesn't taste a lot like chai to me. I will not buy it again.
2,Jobim Music Marvellous - Sound Reproduction Poor.,Hello Friends:My title says it all.The music of Jobim is unparralled. His beautiful songs desereve five stars.However the quality of the sound is very poor. Possibly produced from old original recordings without sufficient modern technological correction and filtering. Very poor quality.L.Roly Jobin.
5,Wave,"Being a former musician and having played many of these songs back in the late 60's hearing them again after so long brought back many good memories of club dates and road tours. The soft bosa nova sound is relaxing and takes you to another place. Compaired to the bone jarring stuff I hear my grandkids play, this is heaven."
5,Over and Over,"My father listened to Jobim while I was growing up. Mostly 8 track tapes. Even as a kid, while everyone else was listening to rock, I loved Jobim's sound. Now that I'm older, I can't get enough of the classics Jobim composed. ""WAVE"" and ""TIDE"" are certainly Jobim's landmarks. Easy listening over and over. I can never get enough of this one!"
4,The Music of Antonio Carlos Hobim,Jobim Music is to float on a cloud of dreams. I have most of his music performed by all the great Brazilian artists including aa superb rendition by Frank Sinatra {not Brazilian}Ilove this CD.Although it is Instrumental The music is divine.Jobim inspires love and romance in me.From Arti a 24 years GUY
3,Not what I was after,"Was looking for that warm samba/bahia/bossa sound and what I got here was dangerously close to elevator music. Maybe really high quality elevator music, but nevertheless. This guy is acknowledged as a master, and I have no doubt he is, but this flavor is sooooo smooth that it feels more like lawrence welk."
3,Nice but...,"It is a nice CD. I have always liked Jobim's music, but this CD was not what I was expecting."
2,One Enjoyable Track,"The title track, for which I bought the CD, was everything I expected. Unfortunately the rest of the CD was ""ho hum"". I'm going to donate it to the Public Radio annual CD sale."
5,**SAMBA HELPS ME**,"MAN! What can i say, ANTONIO was the best Brazilian Composer/Artist. He Wrote alot of Brazilian,Samba songs in the Latin sound th@ was populare in the 60's in all kinds of music Genrefrom Pop Vocal to as far as EZ Listening.I LOVE THIS ALBUM, from the title song WAVE, to th@ very artful cover picture. It reminds me of the movie poster for the 1959 movie, ENDLESS SUMMER, another must have and one th@ i have purchased from this wonderful site AMAZON and all its sellers.Thanx to all who wants to listen to me, and YES Happy Listening.Michael B. VA"
1,Format not for USA dvd player!!!!,"Couldn't watch it. I thought since it said ""all regions"" it would be okay. Not so. Don't get it unless you check it out."
1,I hate that the necessary info was missing,"I purchased this DVD and found it won't play on my Blu- Ray because it is formatted for another country. Why was this info nowhere to be found, in the ad or on the item? I want to send it back but they are ignoring my emails. what can I do?"
1,Worst possible blade replacement alternative,"Blade inserts are junk - poorly assembled, impossible to install, and way too expensive for what they are. Full blade assemblies ready to snap on are only 10-20% more and will always work; these don't. After becoming enraged with the stupidity of their product I just threw them away; the damage to my blood pressure wasn't worthwhile. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Trico 47-600 6mm Break to Fit narrow Refill,"I purchased a set of Trico 47-600 narrow 6-mm wiper refills for my 1990 Ford Probe. It was impossible to thread them through my wiper blades. When I measured the refills they measured 8-mm in width. The extra two millimeters makes all the difference in not fitting. Normal wiper refills are 9-mm, it appears the Trico factory is putting the same size refills in all their packages regardless of the labeling. Their quality control is completely untrustworthy. Do not buy these wiper refills for 6-mm narrow wipers."
1,product is fine but can be had for less than $7 at Advance Auto,"Same exact product at Advance Auto costs under $7 vs $11 here on Amazon. Come on Amazon, you're supposed to be the best price guys!"
4,Another good read :o),"After I read the Inspector's daughter I started straight onto this book and was not disappointed, I think it is actually better than the first Rose McQuinn story. The quirky characters are interesting and believable, the main charters likable and you find yourself hoping the best for them, and this is a good testament to Ms Knight's story telling skills. I hope the following books will be as enjoyable. If you enjoy an easy mystery read in a historical context I recommend this book."
2,NANCY DREW LIVES AGAIN!,"When I was a preteen and a 'tween' I loved to read Nancy Drew. Now I know what happened to her! She grew up, became the 'Inspsecter's Daughter' went to South Dakota and came back from Arizona, losing her husband and somewhere between her adventures with the Sioux Indians in the 'Inspecter's Daughter' and the Apachee Indians in her 'Dangerous Pursuits' HUH??? These books are so sophomoric and juvenile the author can't even remember a main point - where Rose and Danny were in America -- which State?? -- Which tribe of Indians??? Has the author never heard of research, writing notes, a proofer?"
5,Smartly funny,"I don't write reviews, and I don't purhase movies but I'm doing both for this one.What a great movie. In a time when most humor has really stupid sophomoric humor, this movie is smart, fast, clever and unexpectedly expected. Enough said. Rent or buy this movie. Watch it and prepare yourself to watch it again. Get a kleenex because you'll laugh so hard you'll cry."
4,An excellent printer at 54.99 or less only!,"The hp 3820 is an excellent printer.I have used the printer for over a year.The weak point is the cost of ink...My printer is trouble free and a joy to use.Watch out though,i saw one seller marking this unit up to almost 1000 bucks!!!!!!!!!!Dont be scammed!!! Dont pay more than 54 dollars for new and less for a refurb,which i dont recommend....Check the sales and buy new!!Please make sure the retailer has a refund/return policy of at least 30 days should you have a problems.Thank you 09/19/07"
4,Fold polyhedra using a square,"Although folding polyhedra is not my favourite, nevertheless I do indulge in it.Most of the polyhedra are folded as modulars. John Montroll folds them using a single square. Quite a challenge since most of the models are not simple to fold.Models in this book include tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, decahedron, double diamond hexhedron, triangular dipyramid, pentagonal dipyramid, hexagonal dipyramid, heptagonal dipyramid, triangular prism, pentagonal prism, hexagonal prism, sunken platonic solids and many others.I prefer folding polyhedra using modular techniques since they end up much more colourful. In this book polyhedra are folded using a square and hence only in one colour.At the end of the book, Montroll gives suggestions on how to expand on the techniques he uses in this book to create your own one piece polyhedra.Yes, I recommend this book for polyhedra enthusiast."
4,This book is really cool.,I really liked this book because it explains how to do all of the complicated folds. It also shows you a picture for each step so you can see what to do. I do not think that beginners should start with this book because some of the folding steps are a little hard to follow.
3,Interesting book but difficult models,"This origami book is interesting, and it contains many unique ideas. The models can be very elegant if folded well. That being said, it is almost impossible to fold them well, as most of them are extremely difficult to fold accurately. A _lot_ of patience is needed, much more so than modular origami, to really use and appreciate this book."
2,Will deprive you of the will to live,"There are some children's books that delight children and their parents alike. For the love of God, turn away from this book go buy one of those.My 15 month-old loves the bright pictures in this book and frequently brings it to me to read to her. Unfortunately, a little part of my soul dies in agony every time I do. A sample:On goes my diaper,One, then two socks,When I pull on my dress,I can play with my clock!Argh! I lost eight brain cells just typing that in, but if it saves another parent, then it's worth it."
3,"ok, not fabulous","Since my little 5 month old loves ""Good Night Baby"", I figured this would be similar. Although it's an easy and cute book to read, it's not small enough for baby to hold, and not soft enough either. It's cute, but not a huge hit."
5,The Best So Far,I have tried a number of brands of adhesive that is dispensed like the Tombow product. This is definitely the best so far. It reliably dispenses the adhesive. I also like the flip lid that protects the opening where the adhesive is dispensed.
3,Good perfrorances but the sound is a turn off,These are very solid performances of these works. You might say nothing special but they do allow you to engage with all the music well. The sound though is the dreaded Columbia/Sony sound which lacks a sense of air and space which makes for a 'dry' sound which is especially prominent in the first concerto. I enjoy the second more and do like the other 'filler works' that are included.
3,Three Stars,Not a book I couldn't put down -- maybe I missed the point. It is just a three star book from me.
3,The Scent of Water,To much environment descriptions rather thanthe meat of the story. I found it difficult toremain interested.Not too thrilled
4,A really good read!,"A surprisingly attractive novel. Having never read anything by this auther, I didn't know what to expect. What I discovered was a well written, enjoyable novel that I recommend for one's reading pleasure. A delightful adventure."
4,"A magical, lyrical read!","A tale of a woman trying to find out about her past relative who has willed a home to her in a small community in the english countryside. She not only learns about her, but at the same time deals with her own past, and meets wonderful people for her future. A story so descriptive, and imaginative that sometimes you wonder if you're awake while reading. A very gentle story, lovely characters."
4,The scent of water,"Elizabeth kept me enthralled with her character personalities and true to life experiences,a great read and very uplifting story that left me feeling happy"
5,Still Waters Run Deep,"I concur with all of the reviews so far. This book has never failed to comfort and calm me; I have read it at least five times and learned new things each time. As in her other books, Miss Goudge blends past and present in a way that dispels loneliness. Her characters are delightful, her garden and interior descriptions beyond compare, and her capacity for understanding suffering and bringing it into the light of redemption a rare gift. If I meet a Goudge fan I know I've met a person who sees beneath the surface of things, into the heart."
5,Let's talk about sax,"I'll admit that I didn't know who Greg Osby was until I saw his latest album Channel Three in the store. I was interested because I listen to jazz from time to time, and when I discovered that this album was on Blue Note Records, I was even more intrigued because they're known for putting out good stuff. I listened to the album and found that my notions were right.Greg is a brilliant saxophonist, which is obvious by listening to any one of the tracks on here. ""Vertical Hold"", ""Test Pattern"" and ""Please Stand By"" are wonderful examples of this, as is the aptly titled ""Fine Tuning"". In fact, every song is noteworthy. If you've worn out your Norman Brown albums and you need something new, then pop this in and as another reviewer instructed, don't change the channel.Anthony Rupert"
3,A bibliography...,"This simple bibliography compilation gives little to no other information. Also, finding some of the sources listed in the book are hard to impossible."
1,wrong Patak product sent,"What arrived at my door was not the mixed pickle which I ordered by the pickle relish, an entirely and utterly differnt Patak product which I find useless at best and unpleasant at worst. This is clearly a case of misleading advertising."
4,Something else from an original composer,"For hardcore Thomas Newman fans this CD will be a very pleasent surprise. This is something new from the unique styled composer, who we love so much. The score for the Good German isn't as melodic, and easy to listen, as all the other Newman-compositions. But it certainly brings some new flavour and a new side of the multitalented composer. The CD is quite short, but it's still enjoyable, although I would've nominated Newman's other score this year, Little children for the Oscar. If you like Thomas Newman, you should definately own this soundtrack."
5,A profound novel about a fugitive and a young woman,"Set in the Carolina colonies in the 1690's, Mirrors Of The Soul is a profound novel about a fugitive and a young woman, both caught up in dire and desperate times. Jared Tanner has fled England to escape a murder charge and the colonel who vows to see him hanged; Felicity James desperately needs a champion and protector. Together they seek shelter in the Carolina wilds, but that alone cannot hide them forever - each must confront their own personal demons to have even a chance of taking control of their own lives. A vividly moving, often blunt story of learning to face one's problems."
4,Good for beginners,I am now a full-fledged ceramics nerd. Many ceramics shops have been springing up in my area and I am now a regular at one. There is nothing better than turning a blank piece of pottery into an originally painted gift or keepsake. This book shows easy-to-do designs and techniques. A must-have for any other ceramics maniacs out there.
5,Interesting book,Bought this for my husband. He has looked at it repeatedly since he got it a couple weeks ago. He loves it!
1,Not helpful,"If this book is supposed to be a how-to book as its title states, it falls very short. I couldn't find anything of use for me, since I want to restore much more delicate models, than those shown. Even the things the author talks about do not really explain how to do anything.I should have paid attention to the first reviewer."
1,Not for the professional,"This book is terrible! All the author talks about is sand-blast, then throw a coat of paint on it. Doesn't talk about how to restore a product to like new condition. Absolutely no body work is shown, uses tools incorrectly, etc. Even the pictures in the book show pitting after completed paint jobs and other incorrect techniques.I am SO disappointed in this book. I should have listened to the other two reviewers who gave similar reviews."
4,"American Toy ""Fixer""","This is mainly for American Toys (which is fine), but, I was hoping for some Japanese toys also. But, still a good resource. Thanks."
5,Birthdays,"Since I got married, the birthdays (and other special days) have come at us fast and in force. For these reasons, we have been late on more than one special day. So, this calendar is a real life-saver. It can be used year-after-year, and it allows you to stay on top of all the special days that come around in the year. My wife has been wanting one of these for some time. By the reaction I got when I gave this to her, I would have thought I had just given her five dozen real roses and not just a calendar with pictures of them! BTW, the roses pictured in this calendar are beautiful, but the beauty to me is that we can finally keep track of all these special days!"
1,Light and Fluffy,If you enjoy grocery store tabloids then this book might be for you. Or if you live in Texas and experienced any of the subject matter then it might hold your attention. However compared to great books it just can't be ranked any higher than the one star I give it. It is reassuring to know that these girls managed to have REAL lives eventually.
4,Toy pots and pans,My 19month old niece LOVES her play pots and pans. She plays with them all the time - very durable!
3,Not as great as reviews imply..,"I just received these today after ordering them from another site and while they are cute and I am sure my daughter will enjoy playing with them, the quality is actually not what I was anticipating. The salt and pepper skakers don't have a bottom and feel flimsy like they could be crushed fairly easily, the ""sporks"" have leftover threads of plastic stuck between all of the tines, and everything seemes a little rough and unfinished. There are also little flaws of leftover plastic from where these must have been separated from each other in production on the side of each and every piece. The plastic does seem solid (other than the shakers) and once I clean up the manufacturing 'leftovers' of rough plastic I am sure my daughter will love them. Just be prepared to smooth out rough edges and peel off residual plastic before giving these to your child to play with!"
1,if you need POTS only,"We've got a Step 2 kitchen from our friends with TONS of extra stuff, but the two pots (the ones which actually make sounds) were missing.I searched on-line and found that for the set Amazon has the best price, however, if you only need Pot and Frying pan, as we do, go to Step2 replacement parts, they are 3 times cheaper than the whole set. If you got your kitchen from friends or other places, you probably already have plates and spoons, so why spend more on stuff you really don't need."
4,"Realistic, fun dish set",I was so happy to find a set that was not pink with flowers and that wasn't ultra-gourmet. This is a perfect simple set that lends itself well to pretend play. I love it with Melissa and Doug Food Groups.
5,"For toddlers, not so much for preschoolers","I purchased this set for a group of young toddlers (one-year olds). Very durable and would be difficult for a child to injur him/herself. The children love to dump and fill with the deeper pieces and stir with the utensils.I would prefer a more 'real' set with aluminum cookware, metal silverware, and glass plates for an older child, such as the child pictured with the description."
4,Just as I remember it,"I treasured this book as a child when my grandmother gave me a copy on my first solo trip to Ireland at age nine. It was difficult to find due to being out of print for so long. I was thrilled when I located an affordable used copy. The stories are just as I remember them. The book was written by the 3rd Irish President's (Eamon de Valera) wife, and they are written in such a way that they can be enjoyed by adults and children alike."
5,Lovely Book,This is my favorite children's poem of all time. The pictures are just beautiful. They offer many opportunities to interact with your small person.
1,the preview does not match the book,"The ""Look Inside"" preview shows an edition with illustrations by Paul Galdone. However, the edition of this particular book has illustrations by Ian Beck. This is not obvious if you are not paying close attention.Amazon engineers, you need to change this preview!! Your customers can google to get the poem if they are not familiar with it. Showing a children's book that is illustrated by a different illustrator is misleading!NOTE: my rating is for the misleading preview, not for the book itself!!"
5,Gorgeous illustrations!,"I found this book at the Tate Museum in London recently and was completely smitten with the beautiful illustrations. Both of my children loved to recite ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" by Edward Lear when they were small. Now my grandchildren will be able to have this book. I've never seen better illustrations of the poem. Wait until you get to the page where ""they dined upon mince and slices of quince"". It's too adorable!"
2,Only the first verse,"This is a visually appealing edition of the first verse only of Lear's classic nonsense poem. If the reader is expecting the entire poem, this book will be a disappointment."
5,Owl and the Pussycat,Lovely condition. I can not wait to read it to my grandson when he is ready. A perfect story to start with...not to long but fun.
4,Excellent stories...,"We actually bought this as a library replacement - but this is filled with great stories for the whole family. Nothing to scary, or boring. Great for car trips or even bedtime stories!"
2,"Great idea, but some details...","I returned it. As another reviewer said, some of the illustrations are outright scary. My kids are used to Grimm's fairy tales, fables, and all, but I prefer leaving it to the limits of their imagination when it comes to scary pictures. Some of them were not only scary, but outright ugly. Wondering what the illustrator was thinking."
4,great stories and illustrations,"great book for my sons and daughter; would recommend it for ages 8 - 12 reading level,but all ages for interest level. Beautiful pictures and a balanced choice of real-life hereos.Kids these days can thrive on this type of real-life good news to build up their own tendencies toward virtuous living."
4,The Children's Book of Heroes,We bought this for our 4 year old son for Christmas and we really like it. Our son loves books and this was a great addition to his little library
4,Values & Character,Bennett has produced the perfect teacher of strong values and character. It is a necessity for families who feel betrayed by the public schools.
2,Diappointed by the Illustrations,"I was very disappointed by the illustrations in this book. I ended up keeping the book instead of returning it because I liked (most) of the stories. They were well writte an, with the exception of some of the more fanciful/mythological stories, well chosen. However, some of the illustrations were very frightening/disturbing. I didn't find them to be appropriate in a book with stories meant for children. I ended up tearing out all the pages that I found objectionable and keeping the rest of the book."
2,"Agree with the content, not the slander","I've been doing a lot of studying in recent months on tithing and came across Mr. Johnston's book. Although I agree with the main thought that tithing being taught in the institutional church is not correct, I am very disappointed with his open slander and malicious criticism of those in the church. Although we are not to condone actions of those that are openly contrary to God's word, as another reviewer stated, Mr. Johnston is not expressing God's love in any way regarding the individuals he's addressing. Aren't we supposed to gently correct and restore??"
1,***ZERO STARS***,I kinda felt cheated after paying such a lot for such a badly written book. Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself practiced and endorsed tithing as we see in the Gospels. The book of Hebrews gives many clear references to the tithing principle for the church today. I felt the author's arguments and teaching were very weak and confusing; it's almost like he goes out of his way to modify the plain/simple teachings of scripture to suit his own brand of doctrine. Having been a faithful tither for nearly 30 years I know from experience that it pays great dividends to tithe. I give this book: ZERO STARS. Most disappointing!
2,"Had to dig through the poison, to find the meat!","The entire book could have been condensed into 20 pages if all the hatred, bitterness and name calling were left out. The author takes GREAT liberty in assuming things! Statements like, ""Your pastor is involved just as much, if not more than the televangelist"", are spilling out of the book on virtually every page and of course can't be substantiated at all. It's really a shame because the book has the potential to transform a persons entire outlook, unfortunately it didn't do that much for me. If you're really looking to explore the subject I would recommend a different author, or perhaps just research the scriptures for yourself. - Tom"
1,Zero Stars,"It is unfortunate that this book's usefulness as an authoritative source is compromised by numerous (glaring) errors. On the plus side the illustrations are first rate.It's a pretty book, but if you are looking for serious information, look elsewhere."
2,Missing cd-rom,"The content of the book is average, i expected more of it. The author makes a lot of references to the cd-rom that comes with the book, but if you buy the kindle edition you won't get the cd-rom."
1,Good idea but,"Good idea but, will not work with windows 8 and i dont know if it will work on line at all. I could not get the soft ware for windows 7. the scale work good if that is all you need"
4,Good scale but has a couple of limitations,"I needed a scale to calculate postage in a location where it could not be connected to a PC. For the price this seemed a good choice.However, the scale is somewhat slow resetting to zero after a postage calculation. It does NOT calculate USPS Express mail rates. It also does NOT calculate USPS First Class Flat rates for oversize envelopes (larger than 6-1/8"" x 11-1/2""). Since these are common mailings for most businesses, these rates should be available.In spite of these limitations it has been useful to us. We just had to put up a chart next to the scale for the missing postage rates."
1,Could not download postage rates,"Could not get scale working because we could not download postage rates to the scale at least so far. The scale requires an included RJ-11 to female serial connector to download postage rates and we tried the included cable and two others on two different PCs. The fact that they require, in 2010, an RJ-11 to Serial Port is bewildering. Pelouze really didn't want to help us and discouraged us from sending the scale back to them so we are now sending back to their distributor. We wasted at least 4 man-hours on this so far."
1,Poor choice,"I bought this scale elsewhere, was very disappointed when I tried to install it, am taking it back to the store and will now buy at Amazon -- but not Peluze.The box and promotional literature do NOT tell you that there is some fee (I couldn't find out how much) for upgrades of the rate charts.The box makes it vague about International Rates -- but limited to Mexico and Canada -- not a true range of uses.I took more than 90 minutes to go through the program installation, downloads of licenses and program and rates, and then the program would not accept the rates I had just downloaded -- error message was that ""rates are not compatible with scale.""I tried to get more information from their web site -- no help. I finally wrote an eMail to support, but no answer yet.I will not buy any other Peluze products -- good machine, perhaps, but specifications are NOT shown on in the marketing material or on the box.Karl LorenVan Nuys, CA"
5,Great postage scale,"I have had this scale for our school for 7or 8 years. My problem is I forgot to take the cord you hook the computer off my old computer and our technology dept took it and now I don't have the cord to download the new postage rate. But it has worked real well for our school and we have 1,000 students here"
5,Amazing,"i have to admit, like all of Donna Jo Nappoli's books, she takes my breath away. on some of the latest comments i cannot agree.honestly, this is one of the top three (in my opinion the other two are Sirena and Beast) As someone who has had a passion for disney, fantasy, mythology and fairy tales, i am at a shortage of words to describe what this small book did to me. I am 17 yrs old; and i can honestly say if you are a fan of this authors work, this book must be read despite other comments. I find The Great God Pan entrancing, magical and absolutely incredible. I cried halfway through it and continued till hours afterward.I highly recommend it for those who like stories with plots and intelligent details with stomach butterflies.PLEASE READ IT!!!!"
5,Pan falls in love,"this is a tale of love between the Great God Pan...dear lovers of mythology,... and Iphigenia, who was sacrificed by the Greeks to appease the gods so that they would bring up the winds needed to sail to Troy. We've only read two of Donna Jo Napoli's books so far, this one andSirena, but they were both wonderful retellings of ancient myths (in this case both greek myths). She is definitely worth reading.kyela,the silver elves"
2,Expected better but mildly interesting...,"I've read some of the author's other retellings and was a bit disappointed with this one. We meet Pan, the half goat/half god who basically flits around the woods with other mythical creatures all day. It isn't until he meets Iphigenia and falls in love with her that his life really seems to have a purpose. People with any background in Greek mythology know that Pan had a curse placed on him upon birth that he will never be loved in return. His quest to find Iphigenia again then seems a bit fruitless to the reader, but what we don't realize is that he may be able to save her from her father's mission to sacrifice her. This book needed more detail. I felt it was lacking in some other areas as well, as the plot meandered quite a bit. I did like how the author included a family tree at the beginning so we understood how everyone was related however."
2,"Nice Black and White Silhouettes, But Not Very Helpful","This is a small collection of some black and white examples of kimono. It may be useful for clip art, and general reference, as the images are lovely.It is not, however, going to be helpful in researching Kimono for historic, costuming, or other purposes. It contains no text, only the large images. I think a basic book of Japanese/Oriental clip art would be more helpful. I have to give it credit though, for being inexpensive, and focusing on kimono in many forms."
1,Design is NOT a pattern,I should have read the other reviews. This is not design as in garment pattern shapes and the printing is not too good either. Waste of time and paper...
3,Really Only For Children,"While this book gives a nice, simple, literally black and white overview of kimonos, there's simple not *enough* material. There could be more variety. However it is simple in the fact that there's no text, providing you with less distraction if you're really more of a visual person.Also, if you assumed this was a coloring book as I did, you'll be poorly dissapointed. Technically it could be used as one, but there's too much black area for it be used as such. If you could, get this book second hand for 2 or less dollars or a thrift shop, or from [...], where I got it."
5,Do you even NEED to read a review to know you need this?,"What are you thinking? Why are you reading this? It's the original five members sounding better in their forties than they did in their twenties ,performing all the songs you know and love (or at least should know and love if you have any taste at all) and the package has a bonus live CD. This is a no brainer if you're old enough to remember why this band was so great to begin with and still are great today with all three Taylors restored.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,Disapointment,"The band is not the reason for this bad review, it is those irritating area codes. DVD doesn't work in Europe. The tip to Amazon: please, mention this in the product description! It is totally stupid to purchase a product, then wait it four weeks and the find out that the area code is wrong! I'm going to return this item."
5,THEY STILL ROCK!!!,"I just happened to flip the tv to VH1 Classic Channel and they showed Duran Duran Live in London. WOW!! What a show. They had the original lineup and they sounded great!! I will be getting the DVD of their concert and add that to my collection. I love good music. I don't care if you're black, white, korean, or polkadot, if you have good quality music, that's what I crave for. And I'm glad to see Duran Duran back on the seen. Take it from a black man, those guys still have it. (And check out the live version of ""Save A Prayer"" AWESOME!!)"
5,"Killer DVD, for real! Duran at their very best","This is an AMAZING DVD that really captures the live-show energy that Duran Duran is most famous for. I had the priviledge of seeing the reunited fivesome live in person in 2003 and again in 2005 ... the DVD brings it all back! And this is, if not the best, among the best show of theirs I have ever seen either live or on DVD/video. They are TIGHT and having a good time.Unfortunatly I haven't had time to see the 3-D portion yet but my best friend said it is amazing ... like you are really there. But extras or no extras, this DVD is worth getting!"
3,It's fine for what it is.,"You need a 100 gram weight to calibrate the scale before you use it, and it doesn't come with it. Calling the company got me the information that 20 nickels equals 100 grams, but it would have helped to know that I needed a the weight."
1,Broke within 30 days!,"I purchased two of these units. One broke after 30 days. Not sure about the other one, as I gave it away as a present."
2,US Balance US-First Class Digital Hanging Scale,Item was not as described. Cannot read the display unless the item is laying flat then there is no need for the clip.
1,digital postal scale,I bought it to replace a small finger-suspended postal scale. This looked like it but had a digital display. It did not work consistently so I returned it.
3,OK -but you get what you pay for...,"I wasn't expecting much from this scale. And that's what I got. It seems to work OK, however, the display backlight isn't bright enough and I have to view it from an angle to read the scale. It came with two batteries already inserted and two extra batteries. The inserted batteries were dead. The extra batteries died in two days (after minimal use). The last display I read said ""LO"". I ordered a 10-pack of the batteries on a famous auction site for a mere $1.50 (with S&H included). If the new batteries work without dying fast, then I'll keep using this. When it worked, it appeared to calibrate to zero correctly, and measure accurately. Caveat emptor."
4,"Case is great, but don't buy it here","sterling123 is *NOT* selling this case. What he actually sent was a cheapo piece of vinyl crap, no explanation offered. Hopefully, Sena will decide to sell the cases here directly soon.Case is slim and elegant, doesn't interfere with the use of screen or keyboard. If you want to protect the screen when you're not using it (this case doesn't, which is why I only give it 4 stars), Sena also makes one with a flip-down cover -- because it flips from the bottom instead of the top, it's a lot less dorky-looking than the usual sort. Ideal if you carry it in a handbag or belt pouch and don't want a lot of added bulk or weird-feeling rubber."
3,Light entertainment,I have mixed feelings about this book. I found the author does a good job of pulling you into the story so it's easy to keep reading. The characters are fun but where my objection comes in is the constant emphasis on their physical attraction to one another. Every scene seems to have some comment in that regard and I found it to be overdone and hard to believe. Beyond that I really did enjoy the story and could recommend it for light hearted entertainment.
3,Against HisWill,A light romantic comedy. Easy reading. I would recommend this book to a friend. It was very entertaining and fun reading
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this as a daily deal for my kindle. I expected ""light"" reading, but this is so implausible I can't even finish it. The communication between the main character and the dog is completely unbelievable. Equally unbelievable, the dog psychologist who mistakenly thinks the dog has been neutered. Anyone who has seen an intact bulldog would never mistake it for a neutered bulldog. Just writing this so other people won't waste their money like I did."
1,awful!,"This book is awful. Too cute, too focused on ""will they or won't they"". The story is thin to nonexistent and what there is develops too slowly. I cannot believe I spent money on this trash. I gave up midway."
2,"Boring, boring","I couldn't get into this. The story premise sounded interesting but I got really tired of the constant sexualized descriptions of the characters. I just wanted to get to the story. It just seemed so poorly written. What's the old writing adage: ""Show don't tell."" This author never mastered that skill. Unless you like constant references to rounded buttocks and dazzling eyes, avoid."
2,Just. Romance,"Found this book to be too much of a romance with little ""meat""to it. I like a lot more of a story line than just he meets her, they attract and act on it."
2,I may not finish,"so I decided to go ahead with my review. I do have a rule against reviewing an unfinished book but.......this at 50% is just grinding on my nerves. A few have already mentioned the sudden switches in plot and characters without any spacing at all. Totally inexcusable even for a bargain. And the supposedly romance stuff is painful and excessively redundant......makes my teeth hurt. Love dog stories except for 1 kind, so I may stop just in case author has plans to off the dog! I do NOT recommend this book!"
3,Could have been five stars....,"If not for some serious, and I mean serious editing issues, I would have liked this more. You are happily reading along and then all of the sudden the scene switches completely to another character and location -- confusion -- you reread the sentence and and then finally realize that this was an editing mistake, should have been a new paragraph or even a new chapter.....and this does not happen once, it is throughout the book. But as for the story, it was amusing and I loved the dog.....a bit sugary, but heck, that is what dessert is all about."
3,Against His Will,"Only because of the issues I am having did I rate this only three stars. If it had been COMPLETE I would have certainly given it five stars. I am mostly enjoying this book BUT there have been many places where sentences are not complete and then it goes to another paragraph. This is very annoying and distracting. Hope this will be addressed before it is sold again. SOMEONE with editing experience needs to go through this Kindle edition and fix these issues.Otherwise, it is a completely enjoyable and funny story."
1,"Awful, awful, awful!","Read about 6 pages and got sick at my stomach. This is a terrible book written by a woman, trying to write like a man. Unfortunately, this woman can't think like a man. He can't help but notice that the female character has Luscious lips, etc. There is nothing realistic about this book.There's cuteness ad nauseum, even containing a cute dog named Muffin. Yuck! No wonder it was $1.99."
5,Perfect Summer Reading!,"Want a book to take on vacation, to the pool or on the plane? Something that's light, funny and frothy but still has a plot? Well here it is. Just enough tension to keep you reading. Even more fun if you like dogs. A fun romp"
3,Writing: Excellent -- Formatting: Not so much,"This was a very nice story, of the ""hunky dolt who becomes enlightened and vastly improved by the love of a good woman"" variety. It was a little difficult to keep track of the scene changes, though, because whatever formatting change (probably a blank line or three) indicated scene changes completely disappeared in the Kindle book, making the chapters rather dense and confusing as single buckets of undifferentiated words.As an example:...she was trying to tempt him.""How in Hell did you lose her again?""After mature consideration, and carefully reading through the surrounding text, one discovers that the scene and characters have changed to a different set entirely, but it's extremely irritating to have to work so hard for what ought to be a light read.Whomever she paid to convert this book from its print format should be ashamed to have done such shoddy work, and the author really ought to get her money back."
4,Fun reading,I enjoyed the story. I think one reason I liked it so much was the bulldog featured in it. It was a nice light read which everyone needs sometimes.
4,Against his will.,"Good story line and it kept my interest. At first I did not think I would like it but it was just what I like to read, it had romance and mysteries ."
1,Real cannibals that keep diaries are embarrassed by this movie.,A guy loves a girl so much that he wants her to kill him and eat him. She does. Later she dies. The end. Don't let that description mislead you. The movie is not that exciting.The same scene keeps playing over and over again. This is really nothing like a movie. It's more like a B-roll tape that you would screen for something good and might use 5-minutes of for a movie.This movie feels like it will never end. It's not so bad that it's cool. It's just bad.
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"Here's another one of the once competent director Ulli Lommel's recent micro-budget movies. This time it's about a young couple who meet on the internet, fall in love, and the girl eats the guy. Told mostly in flashbacks, with minimum amounts of dialogue, the story would be enough for a fifteen minute short film, but Lommel somehow managed to stretch it out to feature length and needless to say, the result is an extremely slow, very boring movie with lots of scenes that add nothing to the ""plot"" (if there ever was one). You sit around waiting for something to happen but it never does.Don't waste your time or money."
1,empty,"This film is slow and disjointed. No I didn't watch it more than 10-15mins but its enough to know this film doesn't have either the style or technique to get better.How can anyone get involved with the cannibal couple when their relationship is snippets between flashes of gore or her with a bloody face looking matter of a fact. These snippets are among other snippets of her in a hospital bed being interviewed by police then ones that prod the plot along. No character development since there is no character. The plot would have to pretty linear to survive its fragmentation; I think its all supposed to suggest a bad dream.The music is crappy, vapid and vaguely sentimental. There is a sensationalist air to the whole drivel."
2,Disappointing,First of all I didn't buy this from Amazon or one of its sellers. That was my first mistake. I could have read the customers reviews. I didn't hate it ONLY because I am a gore fan and there was a little of it (NOT MUCH) and Jillian Swanson has nice looking tits. (So much for my two stars) My second mistake was trusting Ulli Lommel. I really liked The Boogeyman but he messed this one up big time. The screenplay was horrable. Sometimes movies based on true stories just don't work. This story should have been changed where the woman was insane and killed several boy friends instead of just one. It is SO druged out. Over and over and over the same scene with her holding a knife. The religious cult idea didn't fly either. MY last mistake was NEVER trust a DVD by it's cover. Hey at least there were a couple of interesting previews from Lions Gate before the movie. Don't waste your time with this one.
4,Cyber City,"(Dito my review of Cannon Companion) Crammed full of info, new gear, and clarifying/expansive rules this sourcebook is a must have for those interested in cyberware, bioware, all new nanoware, what is does for you, how it works in you, and how to fix it when it breaks (and with the new rules, it breaks a lot). All of the above plus extensive sections on Cybermancy, Chemistry, Damage, Healing, and Surgery. Following other recent trends in SR products, M&M has misspelled words, and misaligned columns, has broken away from good old Shadowland postings, and refrences you heavily to other books forcing you to fork out the Y and own four different sourcebooks in order to understand a certain game mechanic to its completion. While those not gifted with photographic memory will possibility find the huge amounts of new rule varitations and expansions cumbersome, it is always a pleasure to figure out what it takes to build a friggin' ambulance in the Shadowrun future."
4,Good but a little over the top.,While a good idea they have way too much stuff. Who in their right mind would ever need almost 160 pages of rules and equipment. While adding far more depth and volume they added so much that using the book is a little tedious at first. Also they mad eit so that unless you are a street sam or cyber-monster yuo will never need this much ware'. Also who giver a rat's a-- if you fart in a public place you don't need bioware to prevent it and ant GM who uses that to penalise their characters should be drawn and quartered. SHadowrun is designed to be free flowing while this book covers a lot of holes in SR3 it also slows character creation and game play.All in all not bad and worth your money but be ready for an info overload.
1,Too flimsy to use.,Just a bit thicker than aluminum foil. Construction so flimsy that it flexes when pushed into the dough and will not cut clean through as a result. Avoid this one like a plague.
2,Cheaply made! Don't buy!,"I was looking for a 4"" doughnut cutter and purchased this product. I received the product bent a little bit and upon closer inspection I noticed the middle, smaller hole, was not exactly center. It is a very cheap, flimsy material and I have know idea how it will function as doughnut cutter but I have a feeling it's not going to work out well at all. I feel the list price of $35.99 is very misleading. It's NOT worth the $7.90 I paid for it, after shipping."
1,Beware,This turns out to be a European CD and does not work on American CD players. The Amazon.com listing makes no mention of this fact.
5,Cutest Rocker EVER!,This was my son's birthday gift when he turned 1 last year and he loved it. I now have a seven month old who is already showing interest in it. It's brightly colored and the dinosaur is a nice change of pace from the standard rocking horse. It's so cute & looks great in their nursery. I paid a little more for this rocker at a high end department store but at least I didn't have to pay for shipping & handling. Highly recommend this sweet little dinosaur...especially as a first b-day gift. A BIG hit!!
2,Why all the hype? A lot of people are lying....,I heard all about how great this book was. I love black urban fiction and one of my girls kept saying don't read other urban erotic writers read Zane. Well I am too damn disappointed because there is absolutely nothing urban about this book. These people could be white for all I know because there is nothing street or even black-sounding about the story. I should have known that with a man named Yardley. I say the ending is stupid too because it comes out of nowhere and doesn't make sense. This is not urban erotica street fiction. It is just a regular book with somebody trying to write about sex.
5,CAN'T BOX ZANE IN,"When mentioned the author ZANE most think of black erotica or urban fiction (don't know why because there is nothing ""hood"" about her books). Afterburn is a wonderful book that shows that she much more.A wonderful modern love story. I was waiting for the quote ""It's better to love and lost love than to never love at all"" when Rayne died. Also it shows that Everyone has a past before they come together and I was happy to see their past as well as their present. Can't wait to read the sequel to see Yardley's future. Great Book!!! Non-Erotic or other wise. Just a great Book!!!"
5,"Sexy, Funny and a Great Lesson","What a crazy story? What a cast of characters? What a mother? And that set of friends who are trying to help? What a tremendous amount of emotional baggage we carry around, with the help of various friends and past lovers who just can't seem to get out of our lives.Haven't we all looked at someone, been attracted and for whatever reason did no followup. Anybody that good looking must be attached. Or what can I say that doesn't sound too dumb? Or, I'm just plain afraid.And what an author that can bring this story to paper in one of the funniest, sexiest stories of the year. It's a masterpiece of what can go wrong in the dating game.The ending required the ending commentary. A good novel should tell more than a story. It should leave you with some thoughts. Afterburn certainly does that. There are a lot of cliches that fit but that would be telling.I'm glad to see that there's a sequel coming, these characters are too good to just drop."
5,A must read for single people,I have to say that this book is EXCELLENT. I read it in 2 Days. Iwas so wrapped of in the Rayne character because she reminded me of myself. Despite the sad ending. I feel that character the most. Thick or fat women forget how beautiful how beautiful we really are. I mean that. This book made me stopped second guessing my self worthy. I love Zane. I can't wait for the sequel.
5,AFTERBURN,"FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO COMPLIMENT ZANE ON THE COVERS OF HER LAST TWO BOOKS, SKYSCRAPER AND NOW AFTERBURN. TO SAY THE LEAST THE JACKET AND THE COVER OF THE HARD COVER BOOKS ARE SO INTERESTING. HOWEVER, I GIVE AFTERBURN FIVE STARS, SHE HAVE DONE IT AGAIN, PLEASE KEEP THEM COMING, THEY DRAW ME IN EVERY TIME. I HAVE NOT READ NOT ONE OF YOUR BOOKS THAT HAVE NOT KEPT MY INTREST UNTIL THE LAST PAGE AND KEPT ME WANTING MORE. AFTERBURN KEPT ME EXCITED FROM THE VERY FIRST PAGE. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER HOWEVER IS ARJAY. EVEN THOUGH SHE IS A DOWN RIGHT DISGRACE SHE KEEP YOU LAUGHING, HOWEVER I DID FEEL FOR RAYNE FOR HAVING TO BE RAISED WITH SUCH A MOTHER. I FELT THAT YARDLEY SHOULD HAVE DUMPED HIS FRIEND FELIX ,HE WAS NOT A FRIEND AT ALL, HE WAS A SLIMY ,DIRTY DOG.YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU BUY THIS BOOK, I WASN'T.. THANK YOU ZANE, FOR YET ANOTHER GOOD READ TO BE ADDED TO MY COLLECTION...."
3,Not looking for a lesson to learn,"I have read all of Zane's novels' and even though this one was a page turning from the begining just as all her other books, I was totally disappointed in the ending. I read her books to take me away from everyday life. I did not expect her book to hit me over the head with a brick, with such a dissapointing ending.I'm sure some readers may have enjoyed the ending to this book but compared to her other novels I was truly upset at how Zane was able to get you so interested in Raynes character, and then knock her off in the end. Again I see the wasted time everyday in life and I did not like thinking I had a good book in hand to read and take me away from the real world only to be given a sermon at the end of the book. Hopefully any furture books of this type will have a warning for her faithful readers who have come to expect a certain kind of novel when picking up one of Zane's books at the bookstore."
5,Great Book,This book is awesome and a true measure of Zane's talent! I would recommend this to anyone looking to spice things up! It also arrived fast and in great shape.
4,Great book...whack ending,"This book was AWESOME. It was juicy and had TONS of drama. Twists and turns kept me turning the pages. The only thing that could have been better was the ending. When I read It, my jaw hit the floor but the book was so good , that the end almost ruined it. The ending would have been great for another one of her books but this one was good as is. It was almost as if, she wrote the entire book, finished it then went back and added the rest. BUT it is worth the read. I read it in two days."
5,All I can say is...,"Wow. I truly did not expect the ending of this book. I was so mad, and upset, and angry at what happened at the end to cause such devastation to the otherwise love-filled story. However, at the very very end, I started to like the book again because it ended with mystery. When the next one comes out, I'm definitely going to get it.Great book. Just don't get mad at the end, and stop reading it... finish the book! Its well worth the read."
4,Her Best Book Yet!!!,"Zane has grown alot as a writer, and it shows in this book. The story was cohesive, well plotted and fluid. It's in the top 3 of books I've read this year!Congratuations Zane!"
4,Better than addicted,"""Wasting time"" was the moral of this story and how we all do it. Yardley deserved true love because he was one of the MANY men out here who get overlooked daily. (yes, he had plenty of material possesions and was still overlooked)Rayne was one the typical black females who felt her family history determined who she was. Us as women do that quite often. When all was said and done it was about love and the time wasted before it was proclaimed. Afterburn meant to me...following all the pain we now have love. Short lived."
3,DID ZANE REALLY WRITE THIS?,"Lately, I have been the oddball when reviewing some of the books that are SUPPOSED to be so hot. I was not at all impressed with this book. I think this novel was meant to be on a much lighter and serious note. It isn't sex and drama filled as Addicted, Nervous, or the others. I haven't been reading alot of reviews in detail because I don't like to know what is going to happen. Well, I thought Zane's novel should have been more exciting. To be honest, and I hate to say it because I love Zane, I didn't even want to finish it. Zane and Brenda Hampton are my favorite authors, but Afterburn just isn't cutting it!"
2,Zane (Afterburn),"Sad to say that this was not one of the best books that I have read from Zane. Although I know that there will be a second book, I think this one should have ended a little better than it did. Don't get me wrong I still think that Zane's a great writer but, with all of the back and forth in this title it could have been better. I'll just have to wait for the next book to see if my opinion changes and this thing comes together.R/DJS"
3,What the - ?!?,"Okay - I'm a huge fan of Zane, no doubt, but what were you thinking when you wrote the ending of this book!! I felt cheated! I actually thought - what a waste of energy these two characters went through during this entire book! Frankly, I was so perturbed I didn't even read the last chapter(s). I absolutely quit reading after I realized I was reading the part where her best friend was reading her eulogy. I thought - NOOOOO! She's suppose to wake up from a dream or something! What is this! What happened!! I am so disappointed with the ending. It really broke my heart. I love your work Zane but this one was a low blow! I'm sure other readers will agree! ...but waiting for your next book no less! Ciao!"
4,Ending,"You'll Love the book but it has a Bad ending though. The book is great, great story line, great everything."
3,ok book,i thought this book would have been a better read. i love zanes books. this one just didnt do it for me
4,Great read!,"Miss Zane signed this for me and I enjoyed it thoroughly! This was the first book that I read from her, but have a few of hers in my library. I liked how she illustrated the relationship of the two characters. I kind of saw the inevitable coming, but was hoping for a twist. It is an inspection of not taking anything for granted. Good read!"
1,Not erotic,"I thought this book was going to be ""hot"" erotica. I could bearly find a page with any action on it. When I read erotica, I want it vivid and hot!"
5,Zane has done it again!,"She has toned it down this time, but i could not put this one down. I fell in love with the characters. Like EJD said the woman does exotic things with words. Though the ending surprised me, and i cant quite see Yardley with another woman. keep it coming Z"
4,and the moral of the story is...,"Zane adds another level to her writing in ""Afterburn"" which follows Yardley Brown and Rayne Waters through a few difficult situations. I won't give away the end but this story will leave you with food for thought. Life is short so live today to the fullest since tomorrow is not promised."
4,Good Read,"This one was not one of Zane's sexiest novels, but it was very good. I think the ending will surprise a lot of people, it surprised me. This one didn't have as much heat in it as some of her other novels which is what she is known for. But if you want a good story that flows, I say get this one, you won't be disappointed. The characters are developed really well, and they keep you interested. If you are looking for the ""sexual"" Zane concept, you may not want to get this particular one, her other novels have more heat."
5,HEART WRENCHING IN THE END,"This is one of the best books every by ZANE. While reading this story...I couldn't keep the book down. I took it with me every where. I read it in two days, but coming to the end it literally had me shed a few tears. I felt as if I was the character in this book. Zane you keep writing...because I will definitely keep reading."
4,Zane... I'm impressed,"I LOVE it when Zane writes her short erotic stories. I have not been a fan of her novels...until now. Afterburn was hot, great plot, unexpected twists, and characters that I love to hate. I still think she is at her best when writing her short stories, but I will definately look forward to more of her novels."
4,Such a good story!!!,"I loved this book! I thought it was very interesting, although I will admit I was tired of the back and forth between the two characters. But I suppose that was the purpose of the book, the ending was sad but I can't wait to read the sequel!"
3,Why did she have to die!!???,For those that haven't read Afterburn I won't give it away. But for those that read this trajic story I'm sure you know what I mean. I'm still a fan of Zane but this book was too gloomy for me.
4,It was ight,"This was a decent book, good length and very detailed. The ending kinda of messed me up a lot though. But It leads right into the other book. Its a must read. Oh yeah have a lover nearby because this book will make you hot and bothered."
2,What's Really Going On!,"It's not a bad book but you don't really get what's going on until the end of the book. I think there's a lot of empty spaces in Rayne's life. The book jumps from the time she lost her virginity at 17/18 to her life as an adult around age 27/28. That's a ten year gap and we all know in ten years a lot can happen. Rayne don't trust relationships, not even with her best friend since 3rd grade, but the author never explores why she doesn't. The reader doesn't have a good understanding of Rayne's life with her mom its assumed. In a nutshell, it's one of those books that don't hold your interest so you put it down often and when you pick it back up you have no idea what's going on so you have to read back a page. Of course you finish the book just because...... Somewhere near the end I understood where the Author was trying to go with the book and appreciated the epilogue."
1,CAN U SAY BORING AND PATHETIC?,STARTS SLOWWWW U CAN PRETTY MUCH GUESS WHAT GOING HAPPEN.....BORROW OR RENT A YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY PLEASEEEE!
4,rather good,This four Cd set is rather good I found it very satisfing it isgood to listen too those great songs of the past.Morris
4,Great for one-sided decorating,"The bowl would be great for displaying Christmas balls or something similar on a side table. The only odd thing is that the snowflakes are only on one side of the piece, not the whole way around."
1,Disappointing,Much too verbose. The author is highly intelligent but highly verbose. Little useful information is presented.
4,excellent read for a rainy day,"Very well written novel. I enjoyed the book a great deal. The writer's use of language lets you visualize both the characters and the events around them. It was a little predictable, but a good read nevertheless. I have read far worse. This will be an author I follow. She can only get better!"
5,On a scale of 1-5 this book is a 10 !,"I have read all of the other review and they have really captured this book well. I had to add my 2 cents only because this is perhaps the best book I have ever read. (Well, tied for best anyway). The writing is superb. The story line is compelling and twists and turns. The characters are tormented, selfish and then courageous and self sacrificing. The emotions run the gamut. I do find some of the French Rev. graphics disturbing but those were in fact true. It is unbelievable that such atrocities occurred in our wonderful world at any time of our history. The characters were fully developed and I loved the addition of Phillipe to the story. If you read one book this month, let it be this one. It's remarkable. Great job KM.( ""The rebel and the redcoat"" is an amer rev story by this author which was also excellent. ""The Prisoner"" was also enjoyable.)"
2,Disagree with previous reviewers,"I count it fortunate that I read Karyn Monk's later books (Once A Warrior and The Witch & the Warrior)before I read Surrender to a Stranger. If I hadn't I would never have read any of her other books. This story was so lame. First I couldn't stand the ""heroine"". She was selfish and stupid. She is bent on revenge even if it means leaving her only two younger sisters alone. Then when she thinks she has her revenge she doesn't even make sure it is complete. The hero falls in love with her and I can't figure out why. He is like the Scarlet Pimpernel in saving people from the guillotine. His only shortcoming seems to be falling in love with selfish and absurdly stupid women. I read this with hope it would get better but it never does. I think I am being overly generous in giving it two stars. But if hadn't had some interest I wouldn't have been able to read it through. If only to see what really stupid thing she would do next."
1,This is a reprint and not a new Karyn Monk Book,"Unfortunately, I made the mistake of assuming this was a new work by Karyn Monk - only the cover is new. It took less than one chapter for me to realize I was once again reading a book which was about ten years old. A book I never bothered to finish because it was quite boring. Karyn Monk has the ability to become a superstar in the romance world but only if her publishers refrain from insulting her readers intelligence by reprinting her earlier work and labelling it as ""new"". Save your money & valuable reading time. If you are a new Karyn Monk reader try Once a Warrior or The Witch & The Warrior. If you liked either of those books pass on this one and wait for a truly new Karyn Monk book."
1,Hated It!,"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Karyn Monk. I have read all of her books. If I had started with this one though, I would never have read her other books. Her heroine is a selfish, stupid person who somehow attracts the hero. I found her to be totally unlikeable. I kept reading this book hoping it would get better. (Remember I read all her later books and loved them.) This book never does. The heroine has twin younger sisters that she leaves to go after the murderer of her parents. Not caring that if she dies, she leaves her sisters orphaned. When she finally is able to 'kill' the murderer she doesn't even make sure he's dead! This book disappointed me on so many levels."
5,What a great story and book cover!!!!,"I have read all of Karyn Monk's books except the latest and I love her writing. This book is no exception. I loved Armand with his many talents and intelligence. Was thrilled when she let Jacqueline grow and mature away from her snobbish upbringing. I bought this book not only because I enjoy her writing but I had to have it, as a keeper, for the cover as well. I wish more publishers would acknowledge the models or at least acknowledge the illustrator. Frank Accornero is one of the best along with Jon Paul and I love their work as much as the books. Now I hope a sequel is in the future as I would love to know what happens to Phillipe, Seraphine especially and Suzanne too."
2,Very Disappointed,"Having read Ms. Monks other books I was very disappointed with this one. Try as I might I could not like the heroine. She was not only spoiled but stupid. Throughout the first half of the book she constantly refers to her being from a privilaged family as ""god's will"". She even goes beyond being naive and believes everything she is told which ultimately puts the hero in danger. If you want a good Karyn Monk book try reading ""Once a Warrior"". The characters flow together and you actually feel like your part of the story. My second choice would be ""The Witch and the Warrior"". Good supernatural storyline."
4,savoy brown rocks!,"74 minutes of Savoy Brown ""the kings of British boogie"" They start off rocking and keep on the rest of the way. Old and new songs all sound great. Only thing I did'nt like was a little too much talking after the greatest hits medly. Buy this cd if you like Savoy Brown, it rocks!"
1,For diehards and completists only....,"If you love the early days of ""Getting To The Point"" or even the ""Lion's Share"" version of this band, look elsewhere....Simmonds still has the heart, but the group's performance here is thin and often as amateurish as a common bar band. If you want some compelling live Savoy Brown, get a copy of ""A Step Furthur"" (my favorite) or ""Blue Matter"", each of which has a side of live material."
2,"Weak Song Selection, Amateur Performance...","Very little to recommend here. Simmonds still shows a few flashes of ""semi-brilliance"" although they are buried somewhat in the mix. The overall performance sounds like an unrehearsed pick-up band. The biggest disappointment is the song selection; not one of the groups better known tunes is here. Yes there is a track listed as ""Medley (Greatest Hits)"", but ironically (or sadly) it doesn't include what I consider there best song ""Tell Mama""? So unless you're a diehard fan needing to complete your collection, I recommend taking a big pass on this one.Enter ""Savoy Brown Blue Matter"" in the search box for a much better ""live"" Savoy Brown purchase."
1,Borla exhaust,"This thing sucks A** i had before on my 08 Fj Cruiser a flowmaster super 44, a friend of mine told me about borla and he has the complete system i only had the catback , whenci bought the borla catback i thought that this thing will be loud as hell and have an even more agressive sound because of borla's reputation..When i fished installing this muffler this thing doesnt work, meaning it sounds completely stock no agressive sound, nothing just the sound of the fan and radio. I went took the borla out and went back to my flowmaster. Maybe i will melt this thing and make something functional for this thing. There are 139$ bucks really bad spent but on flowmaster there are 70$ bucks well spent.IF YOU WANT SOUND DONT BUY THIS!!!"
1,Watch,I would not recommend this product it broke very quickly and caused a severe rash on my daughter's wrist. (Made in China possibly with lead)

3,eeeeh..it's ok,"Ok here's the deal.The place they choose to record this is some huge stone church converted into a ""concert hall"" so the acoustics in this place could not be any worse, with a full 3 or 4 second reverb.Pretty much sounds like what it is-a cave. On top of that Mr. director figures- Hell since we are in a cave,everyone wants to see the ceiling,right? So the nitwit chooses to take pictures of the ceiling (grrr!) rather than the musicians who are playing thier a##es off trying to make this thing happen while playing in a cave.Come on guys,Bartok (especially this piece) deserves much better treatment.I must say though,I have always like Boulez's interpretation of this piece (I grew up listening to his CBS Masterworks album of it)especially his treatment of the final movement with a nice brisk tempo which keeps the excitement level high.."
5,Too good to keep to yourself!,"I'd be the first to say that this not the kind of book I would typically pick up to sit down with. But I'm glad I did. The Lesson of the Paper Clips is creative, clever and makes a great point. I've given it to several friends not only for the lesson it imparts but because it is simply fun. I recommend you hookup with this book."
4,Cheaper Than Therapy,"Who wants to be uncomfortable? No one. Well, ""Cheaper Than Therapy"" uses the coolest paperclips to remind us that consistent comfort comes at a heavy pile up or at a high price. The truth isn't easy to hear but it's indeed simple. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to function better in life. I'd also recommend this book to anyone who wants to say, "" I actually read an entire book today!"" I'm a busy one and for me that in it self was theraputic. Thanks Gina! :)"
5,An opportunity to grow,"Who knew that paying attention to inanimate objects could be so powerful? In ""Paperclips"", Ms. Greenlee has humorously and quite consciously given us a roadmap to sorting through the habits we all develop when faced with discomfort. Reading it again and again gives the reader a fresh way of envisioning life's way of offering opportunities to grow."
5,My first review because I put all the others off,"For procrastinating personalities, Greenlee's book is sheer perfection. It's so appealing and quick to read that it's a great thing to pick up while postponing something else. Then, when you read it, it really hits home without being preachy or judgemental. It's a real joy. Great for team leaders or company management to give to staff and great for staff to give to team leaders and management. It works for the old and the young. It's a classic. I'm looking forward to more in the series!"
5,I cannot look at paper clips the same way again.,"Gina has taken an everyday inanimate object, and applied it to our everyday lives.I am a professional procrastinator. I put things off until the last minute, then go by the seat of my pants. From the first time I read it, I have applied it to my personal and professional life. It has truly moved me to become more of an organized person and not let the ""clip pile"" get too big.I gave ""Cheaper Than Therapy: How to Keep Life's Small Problems from Becoming Big Ones"" to all my staff for Christmas. They loved it.I can't wait for ""The Lesson Of The Chopsticks""!"
3,soft paws,"Great idea but my kitten who is 5 months old had 2 of them off in 15 minutes I'm waiting for the rest of them to come off. I worry about the toxic glue too. A lot of work trying to get them on him also. If you are willing to go through all that and watch your cat eat them off, then buy it by all means. I will not purchase again."
