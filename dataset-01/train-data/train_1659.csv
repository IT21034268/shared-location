1,poor,why would anyone pay 558$ for a cassette player?this is just outrageous no one would pay that much money for a broken cassette player from 1984
2,Just Okay,"The Panasonic transcribers are good machines, about the best, but this one in particular leaves a lot to be desired. But all in all we've had the best luck with the Panasonic."
2,Works very well while it works.,"I have worked with quite a few of these transcribers over the years and this would be my least favorite. It works well for a while, but then the rewind and fast forward goes out on the foot pedal and then goes out on the machine itself. Normally transcribers last longer than these seem to. A co-worker has gone through 4 of them in 2 years. We keep asking administration to switch to a different brand, but they say these are cheaper. You get what you pay for, I guess."
3,not so good,"I do tape transciptions at home for doctors' offices. My previous Panasonic 930 worked fine and I finally wore it out. I purchased another model 930. However, this new one emits a very high-pitched squealing sound which may or may not stop when I eject the tape or tap the foot pedal. Slows me down and hurts my ears through the earphones. I will be following up with Panasonic."
4,microcassette transcriber,"I would recommend this transcriber to others. I originally bought this machine in 2003 for under $100. I have used it for over 5 years doing moderate transcription 5 days a week and it's worked great. Within the past 6 months it started to wear out ... the counter died first followed by the headset and foot pedal holes getting stripped, so I have to twist the cords to keep them in place, however for under $20 a year I really can't complain. Now it's under $80. I just bought another one."
4,A fine comic,"The title is actually Daisy Kutter: The Last Train, and it's an excellent graphic novel by <a href=""http://www.boltcity.com"">Kazu Kibuishi</a>. It's a sort of a space western featuring Daisy Kutter, a former outlaw of mythic repute who gets roped into one more gig. The story is simple and rather unremarkable, but its merits as a comic are many. Kibuishi seems to have mastered the subtle pacing and extended silences that make comics so magical, and he has chosen a level of stylization for his characters that is accessibly cartoonish without being cloying or absurd (think The Incredibles and Tintin rather than Mickey Mouse). One gets the impression he has taken all of Scott McCloud's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006097625X/"">best advice</a>, consciously or otherwise. Regardless, this is a real gem."
4,It filters the water,"We have poor water quality in our home and this does the job for our KitchenAid coffee maker. What more is it supposed to do? Make the coffee for me? I would buy one every week if it would. I wonder why KitchenAid does't make a filter that can also make your coffee? It seems that they would corner the market on coffee makers if they did. And it isn't as if people wouldn't pay for it, I mean I already paid $400 for a coffee maker that DOESN'T make the coffee for me, I would probably pay more like $500 for one that did."
1,Way too complicated,I am a contractor and needed some basic how tos on concrete work for a patio. Thought this was a good find. No way!! I felt as if I were in concrete boot camp. Too much information.
1,Dreadful Choice,"Here is that marriage of style and content that we look for in all great books. In this case, however, we have a shatteringly ignorant, vulgar and confused understanding of the subject matter captured in ignorant, vulgar and confused prose."
1,Ignorant,"This book reflects sheer ignorance of its subject matter. Those who rely on it will be disappointed or duped. Admittedly, there are not many books out there that cover this subject well, but they do exist, and their funtion and utility are all the more critical when one considers the confusions and falsehoods propogated by the likes of Paulson's book"
1,Not recommended,"I would give this book no stars if I could. I agree with the previous reviewer, this is not the book for someone who is seriously interested in Kundalini. This book for the gullible people of the world. There are many good books on Kundalini out there with far more credible information."
1,New age drivel,"I am researching Kundalini Shakti and thought this book may be of help. However, it soon became apparent that I had erred when the author stated that she had been instructed by 'higher beings', that the Aquarian age was forcing previously esoteric knowledge into the public domain, that the alignment of the planets would have some affect on my Kundalini and that I should indulge in free form dancing. The bulk of the text regarding Kundalini appeared little more that exercises in auto-suggestion and the actual chapter on how to release the Kundalini lacked precision. I could not recommend this to anyone seriously interested in Kundalini"
1,"This is wrong information, I can prove it ! RE: SOS","In the book the following is a quote from,"" With the end of the commercial use of the Morse Code this year, no sailor will ever again send an ""SOS"" signal. Those letters, by the way, stood for nothing. They were chosen because 4 dots, 3 dashes, 4 dots were easy to remember, easy to send, and easy to pick up."" I am a ham operator, and SOS is three dits 3 dahs and 3 dits, NOT 4, 3, 4, Because, 4 dots 3dashes and 4 dots would be HOH, HMMM? Who wrote this again ? Walter Jinright KG4BVD"
4,Great Work Out,"Loved this work out. I use this between gym visits to keep flexable. Great background, calm setting and a challenging work out. The only improvement that could be made is the length. I wish there could be more."
3,"Good for more advanced, not for average or beginner","I already purchased Ana Caban's Beginner Pilates Mat workout and was interested in adding resistance to it with the body band. So I got this DVD. However, I didn't find out until putting the DVD on that this is an intermediate level workout.Many of the moves are very familiar to me already from the original mat workout. So I was easily able to follow Ana's directions without an explanation of each move. Many of the moves are doable (for me, those focusing on the arms and legs). And the addition of the resistance band actually helps me to keep my body in control and stretches/strengthens those areas even more than the original mat workout. But the most intense moves like the teaser are still impossible for me to do as she does them.I don't see a ""beginner level"" DVD here unless I get the kit."
1,Ana-don't talk so fast!,I picked up this DVD for $5.00 at Marshalls with the intention of incorporating some of Ana's moves in my yoga and Pilates classes (I teach). I loved most of her earlier DVDs; she can be inspiring as her passion for Pilates always shines through poor production qualities. In this DVD she talked way too fast and rushed through the moves. Key for Pilates is to do the move correctly-SLOW and controlled. She failed to adequately set up the moves-highly frustrating as all the shots were wide and I had no idea how she was holding the stretchy band.If you want a really good intermediate Pilates DVD buy Golden Earth's Pilates Yoga Body Sculpting Ball Workout.
3,Still on the fence about this DVD,"I purchased this DVD last week. I have not done pilates on a regular basis and after a couple of tries, I've only been able to make it about 20 to 25 minutes through the DVD - it's really hard! (Don't get me wrong, I know it needs to be tough for results - but this is REALLY HARD) Additionally, I can barely hear Ana's instructions over the strange music. I feel like I will stick with it for the time being, but so far I'm not finding it as enjoyable as I do my yoga DVD (Mandy Ingbar). Bottom line - this is probably not the best DVD for first time pilates people and I believe Ana has a beginner's DVD. Also, sound quality stinks."
2,"Bad editing, sound and hard to follow","Even though there is no question on what David Leadbetter's has contributed to the world of golf, the Vol. 1 and 2 of this video really aren't much what you would expect.First of all, the sound is awful, many dialogs are lost because the sound of the wind hitting the microphone. Also, the editing is poor.The drills presented on the video are not bad, but Nick Price, who is the co-star of the video, makes a superfast backswing, not easy to follow for someone trying to copy a movement or correct a mistake.Considering the poor quality of the video and the hard to follow movements, this is not a video that would be much of an advantage for a golf enthusiast trying to improve his swing.Try something else!!"
1,Extremely disappointing!,"This is NOT for anyone who is even slightly in shape and who does not have a bad back! I should have known when she kept warning people with neck injuries or osteoporosis to skip certain exercises that this program is targeted to people who have such issues. I did not see that information anywhere prior to purchase. I have to admit I did not do the whole program -- after 45 minutes I stopped in frustration. Lynne Robinson obviously knows her stuff, but she talks A LOT between exercises, slowing down what is already a nearly movement-free program. (For example, she introduces the Hundred, but spends so much time on modifications that you don't actually get to do the full exercise!) Really a disappointing waste of time, and now I don't have time to do any actual exercise!Although I am not a newcomer to Pilates, I am not in the greatest shape. I was hoping for something that would help me get into better shape, and this will not!"
3,Regional problem,"The product is fine, however, I cannot play it on my DVD player. I did not know that DVD's are made for specific regions; this product was made to be used in West Europe, Australia and New Zealand regions, (I am in the U.S.). Just a heads up for future buyers, check out if DVD can be played any where or is specific for region."
4,The Leading Man Movie Jon Bon Jovi,"Jon Bon Jovi is really good in this movie. His character is one of greed, ego and ambition while watching you desire him and yet fear the outcome. We have all met a guy like this and it turned out just like we expected but we enjoyed the ride at the moment."
4,Bon Jovi is perfectly cast,"Bon Jovi may not be a Shakespearean actor, but he has chops enough to play a smarmy American that easy to hate, and even easier to envy. The film may be nothing more a series of ruses, but it is fun to watch the actors work. Thandie Newton is particularly good as the object of the playwright's affection, who nearly succumbs to the wicked charms of the awful American. Bon Jovi oozes with fake charm and star quality persona, which is exactly what the role called for. This nothing more than diverting entertainment, but it is fun nonetheless."
4,Bon Jovi shines,I thought this was an excellent thriller and Jon Bon Jovi was really great in it. I cannot understand why this film is not available for sale.I hope to see Jon in alot more choice roles he is well deserving of it.Please try to obtain copies of this film for your frustrated customers.
3,best book,Danielle steel is my favorist writer and her book remembrance is one of her best best novels.I enjoed reading her book very much
5,One of her best,"I have read every one of Ms. Steele's books, and I have to say that of all her novels, this one is the one that has always lingered on my mind. It is very well written - you feel as if you are breathing each moment of the characters lives."
4,Deer Gitters,"Little tiny pictures on the pack show how to assemble. Don't waste your time squinting.Lay the parts on the table and look at them. Then fiddle with them until they fit. There is this right-angle thing going on but they will go together. Sharp edges forward.I don't understand why these broadheads are so expensive. And these aren't even the real good ones (I wish I could afford them).Standby for a field test and report.""Cheap Humidors"" here on Amazon is the best place in the world to buy broadheads."
5,Play it again Tony Hatch,it has been too many years since I heard the wonderful Tony Hatch and the music and orchestra is fabulous..also great to hear Pet Clark singing those wonderful songs again..
4,Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine,I have been a subscriber for years and have now passed it on to a second generation. I like it.
2,Not terrible at all....,"....but dull and stodgy. There are typically one or two borderline-excellent stories per issue, while most of the rest have cliched plots, bland writing,and very slow pacing. Loren Estleman and Brendan BuBois are two of the better writers in the magazine, but quite a few others seem to lack much feel for how actual characters would think and act. There is often also a LOT of padding (extraneous detail). Definitely hit and miss."
3,Fun.....The First Time,"I got this for my birthday, and I had a bunch of my closest friends over for my slumber party, the only person who got to use it was this girl lisa whom i dislike, and the reason only she got to use it was becasue it broke. The whole night everyone didnt talk to Lisa becasue we think she broke it, but after reading the reveiws it seems like everybodys breaks!!! I gave the fun a 5 star becasue the first time is fun, but I wish i could give everything else a 0, how is beading hair educational anyways??It is a worthless sack of junk, i tossed it two days later."
1,Ready to try the Conair version!,"I bought this to try to keep my daughter's hair under control in a way that she would enjoy, but I couldn't get it to work if I used more than 2-3 beads on it - the hair just wouldn't go through the beads. When I got an EXTREMELY thin strand, I could get beads on, but the clip and beads would just fall off then. I'm now looking at the Conair brand one, because I still like the idea..."
2,Cheap piece of plastic junk,"My daughter actually LOVES this toy. That's why its so frustrating. It does, in fact, string beads (up to about six at a time) into hair. However, if you try to string too much hair at a time (more than about 6 strands of hair apparently) the interior gears fall off their tracks and it stops working. I've spent two hours in the two days since I bought this unscrewing it and reassembling the insides. The instructions say you should only use a small amount of hair, but you have no idea how little hair it takes to break this thing. The clasps that come with it are intended to grip larger hair quantities, so if you do use the ""right"" amount of hair, they slide right off along with all the beads you just beaded. AAAAARGH! If you get it, I recommend rubber bands or some other clip to secure the beads. The clips that come with it are useless."
4,Great gift for my 7 year old Daughter,My daughter loves this gift. She can even put the beads on her friends. The beads con be removed and used over and over again. It is very simple to do and helps with cordination. The ONLY negitive I have about this product is the they do not have smaller hair clsp. I have to put little rubber bands on the ends and then put the clasp over the band. My daughter has gone to gymnastics with the beads in her hair and she has also sleep with them and they stayed all night.
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this for my daughter's seventh birthday to share with her five-year-old sister. On our first attempt, the beads went on easily but all slid off when I put on the bottom clasp. We then tried more hair, but it would not pull through. It did, however, pull their hair. We finally got everything to stay on the third try. It broke the next time we decided to use it. I took it apart to try to fix the gears but could not get it to work. It looked like something had broken off, but there was no piece inside. I, too, would recommend rubber bands to hold the beads in place since the clasps are just too big. I would also consider how long the beads will actually be worn. The last time my girls had them in their hair, they took them out within a half-hour."
3,Fun but not built to last,"I bought this for my daughter's 9th birthday. It was fun, but not particularly easy to use on her hair. She has very course hair and if we used just a few strands, we could get it to work--but the clips would not hold. None-the-less, the girls enjoyed playing with it. After several uses, it broke. It is not made durably."
1,Complete Rubbish,Used it five times and it broke - a completely lame product and really upset my five-year-old daughter. Don't waste your money!!!
4,Hair Beader,"This seamed to be a hit at my nieces first slumber party. I bought this as one of her presents and we did all the girls hair. They loved it. Just remember if you want it tight you have to move very slow. Other than that, the girls really enjoyed it and that is what mattered."
4,Definitely very entertaining!,"This was my first Jennifer Crusie book so I was not sure what to expect. She definitely did not disappoint! The book had a little bit of everything all rolled up into one. I did think the story dragged a bit in some areas, so I found myself skimming through some of the book (mostly Em's point of view). All in all though, definitely worth your time!"
3,Reviewer doesn't fib...,"This was a fun, easy read; sexy; mildly predictable and probably my third favorite Jennifer Cruise book!"
5,"Way to go AGAIN, Crusie!","This was a fun and exciting read! I have yet to be disappointed in a Crusie novel. Although some parts were of a very serious nature, Crusie has a way of making you still laugh out loud! Great book from start to finish. You will never be able to guess who the murderer is, but it is fun trying to figure it out! You have just gotta read this book! It will make you a die hard Crusie fan forever!"
2,I thought this was going to be a darkly funny novel.,"The beginning is witty and I thought it was so good. However, the author wasn't able to maintain the humor and by page 200, the book becomes an overblown category romance. Even has the Harlequin Romance Hero clone, C J. The bad boy turned into Mr. Wonderful Husband Material, great in bed, great with the kid, etc. By the time, the cheating husband is finally killed, it comes as no surprise because that paves the way for the standard happily-ever after romance ending. The focus of the book is uneven. It starts out like a novel, then develops into a romance, with a little mystery thrown in the last third of the book. And, all the characters who've been out of school for at least 20 years, are still re-living their high school days/memories. I wanted to say to them Grow Up!"
2,A Disappointment,"After seeing this book appear on so many Amazon lists, I decided to pick it up. Unfortunately, I found the characters boring and unlikeable, the plot contrived, the writing clumsy at times, and the humor smart-alecky and unfunny. I almost gave up after the first 25 pages, but decided to continue because I was looking for a fun book. Sadly, this book wasn't very fun because the main character was unbelievable, annoying and unrealistic. Also, you could see almost every plot twist and turn coming a mile a away."
4,Great Book,"Tell me lies was a great book. Maddie is a woman's who's been through a lot in her marriage and had enough. She finally decides to leave her cheating husband. Her decisions happens right before C.L., the first guy she slept with, comes back into her life. Her husband disappears and C.L. shows her what life could have been like. But Maddie still wants to do what's right for her daughter Emily and isn't sure what life she should live.I like that the book stayed with the same POV's and didn't add one just for convenience. The characters were all great, the story was full of mystery and constantly had me guessing as to who did what, had funny dialogue, and some really sexy scenes. It's a fast easy read that will be hard to put down."
3,Satisfying read,"This is the first book I've read from this author and I liked it. Not the best, but I'll probably read another one by her in the future. I like that there was a suspense added to it. Not the same as other chiclit I've read."
4,Great book!,This was a great book from a much loved author!While this wasn't my favorite book so far I still enjoyed the book and the characters. I didn't agree with some of the life choices made by the heroine but it made for some very interesting drama. For the heroine (Maddie) or star of this slightly dark comedy life has been very blase and too perfect which changes with the arrival of her old high school love interest. The story begins with Maddie's discovery of her husbands cheating (again) and continues in some very interesting twists and turns.If your a fan of Crusie's previous dark comedy/romance books then you'll love this book!
3,Fun Fluff,"Comparing Jennifer Cruise to Susan Isaacs is like comparing Bon Jovi to Bach. It's no where near the same league--but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it!With a tad more believability, a lot more ingenuity and tons more fun than your typical Harlequin-style romance, Jennifer Crusie gives us a little sex, a little mystery and lots of small-town atmosphere. It's a fun read. A good diversion on a cold winter night. She's no Susan Isaacs (despite what the book jacket may say), but she is fun. If you're looking for some fluff with a bit more substance, give this and all her books a try."
4,Second Novel Even Better,"I read 'Crazy for You' by Jennifer Crusie when it first came out in paperback, and I loved it, so I went back out to find her first novel 'Tell Me Lies'. However, I liked her second novel better because there wasn't a kid, like Em, stuck in the middle of a marital dispute.I'm glad that Maddie got out of her relationship with that creep of a husband Brent. I'm also happy that she ended up with C.L. Sturgis, and that Em liked him too. The book made me laugh a lot and I could relate to the small town nucleus where everybody knows everybody else's business. I even liked the story book ending, but I really believe that Crusie did an even better job with 'Crazy for You', which I gave 5 stars."
4,A slightly flawed but still fun effort from Crusie,"There's no such thing as a bad Jennifer Crusie novel. All of the Crusie trademarks are here in spades - witty dialouge, great leading characters, love scenes that manage to be both steamy and hilarious at the same time. No one combines humor and romance better than Crusie. No doubt about it, you will enjoy this book. However, I must admit that as enjoyable as ""Tell Me Lies"" is, I think it is the weakest of Crusie's books. The female lead's life is so out of control - Maddie thinks her husband is cheating on her and preparing to kidnap their child - that I found it a more than a little difficult to believe that she was able to start a romance with her long-lost high school fling. I don't demand absolute plausibility in my romance novels, but this was just too much. The secret of this book is engaging in a little willing suspension of disbelief and just appreciate the humor in watching Maddie cope with her increasing bizarre and frequently funny life."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"If you've already discovered Jennifer Crusie, you don't need me to tell you to find this book now. If you haven't discovered her yet (try to keep up, okay?), you're in for a real treat. TELL ME LIES isn't laugh-out-loud funny -- it's howl-at-the-moon funny."
2,Plain Silly,"I have no idea how this book would get so many glowing reviews? What a waste of time this was. How a wife could find out her husband had an affair and instantly have one her self, it just was silly and stupid. The whole story was something out of ""Desperate Housewives"". If that is something you enjoy you will like this book, otherwise don't waste your time or money."
1,Ummmm.....,".....well I have to say that I was most disappointed with this book compared to Crusie's other FANTASTIC books.If you don't mind the idea of being able to cheat on your other half and morally get away with it because he cheated on you first, you will probably enjoy this book.I for one don't agree with it so I have put this book back on my book shelf and will not read it again.It has not put me off reading any other of her books, as I said before, they are FANTASTIC."
2,not entirely unforgettable,"""Tell Me Lies"" was a bit too much romance novelesque for this diehard mystery reader. The plot *had* potential for a decent mystery, but somewhere along the line, Crusie switched gears and made it a novel of relationships. This was disappointing for me, but I still finished it. All in all, ""Tell Me Lies"" isn't a particulary challenging, funny or even memorable read, but I'd recommend it as light reading for the plane if you were desperate and there was nothing else available."
4,Mystery & Romance All In One,...If you like mysteries and romances you get both in this book.I thought the book started slow but picked up as it went.Maddie (the main character) learns that honesty is better than lies.This is a good book and will keep you turning the pages.
1,Highly overrated. Not her best.,"I was eager to try Ms. Crusie as I had heard a lot of rave reviews about her Crusie-isms. Sadly, I found this book a waste of money. Her characters all needed to 'grow up.' The mystery & romance were neither convincing nor consistent. And, while there were many attempts to be funny, most felt forced & contrived.Exciting this was NOT! as I found my chores much more interesting. Fortunately, ""Manhunting"" is light years better than this one."
2,Readable but Not Much More,"This was an attempt at a romance/mystery howver, it really fell flat. It began interestingly enough-trying to drum up sympathy for a woman in a loveless marriage, trapped in a small town. Quickly, I lost interest as the novel continually jumped perspectives from the woman (Maddie) to the perspective of her 11 year old daughter (who cares) to the perspective of her old flame, CJ, who I never could believe was a rebel no one liked. Not enough time was spent on any one of the characters' development for me to even care about them. The murder of Maddie's husband was never fully developed-I never felt that Maddie was in any danger of being convicted of his murder-nor did I care. I kept asking myself-why doesn't she just move away if she hates the town so much. And the side story with her best friend was really unnecessary and has nothing to do with the rest of the story."
5,Thoroughly entertaining. You'll laugh out loud!,"If you're from a small town, you'll recognize and appreciate a lot of real-life humor in Ms. Crusie's delightful novel. Even if you've never traveled far from a major metropolitan area, Maddy is a character worth reading about and her world will entertain you. Treat yourself to this book. It's worth the money and the time invested.This was actually the first book I'd read by the author. I'm so glad I picked it up. [Admittedly, the feet sticking up out of the convertible on the cover drew my attention at first.] I've since located and enjoyed all of the author's books [through Amazon's Auctions & zShops, since many were hard to find]. If you love cats &/or dogs there's an added bonus in Ms. Crusie's work. She portrays animals in her books with warmth, humor, and individuality that's equal to her enjoyable human characters."
4,Pretty Good,"Whats really weird is that I was in the middle of this book when I saw the movie Hope Floats. I swear to God, except for the whole murder-mystery thing, they are the exact same thing, right down to the eight-year old daughter with glasses. It's a pretty good book, though, except I wondered for almost the entire book what C.L. stood for."
3,Good.. but Crusie's done better!,"I had one irk with this book, and it was the writing style. When characters were speaking it was always ""and Maddie said"", and ""and so and so said"" I got so sick of the and said style of speaking by the end of this book.Good book, but at times it could have been the latest Belva Plain novel with the theme and storyline of finding your high school sweetheart while your marriage is going downhill. The usual Crusie humor does lie beneath though."
1,O'Brien lets his intolerance get in the way of his analysis.,"O'Brien is one of those writers that I tend to disagree with but find engaging and well worth the time, so I picked up ""On the Eve of the Millennium"" as soon as I saw it. O'Brien has never hid his differences with Christianity and in particular Catholicism. However, in revealing his daily prayer for the Pope's death, his obvious hatred of Tradition Catholicism got the best of him. I stopped reading at that point and have no desire to pick up the book again."
1,What a Rip off!!!,None of the songs are from the original artists. Don't buy it!!! unless you don't mind that. Amazon should place a note besides the title when these kind of Rip offs are in the market stating that none of the songs aren't played by the original artist.
3,"Small, But Has Pictures","This was a Small Book with not too many pages, BUT at least it had pictures!!!"
3,"Lots of good ideas, but some frustration also","This is a cute little booklet with a lot of creative ways to wear scarves. It has some photos of live models as well as sketches of the ways to wear scarves with diagrams of how to tie them. BUT in at least one case, the descriptive text doesn't match up with what the diagram shows. And the diagrams aren't always complete enough to fully explain how to tie the scarves. Text alone just doesn't do it. I found myself frustrated and totally unable to recreate one or more of the neck-tie fashions."
1,You can just tell from the title...,"Was there no editor around when this went to press? Aside from being irritated throughout this book by its use of the incorrect plural ""scarfs"", I was also disappointed in the lack of useful information. If you are in the habit of wearing scarves (that's right, SCARVES) you probably already know as much as this book will teach you. The same goes for those who are in the habit of using proper grammar!"
1,this book is really old,"Maybe some of these 1980's styles will come back, but maybe they won't. Still, I would try some of the ideasif the diagrams were better; they also seem incomplete. The photo on the cover has been updated, but photosinside the book are ""vintage."""
2,SENSATIONAL SCARFS: 44 GREAT WAYS TO TURN A SCARF INTO A FABULOUS,ILLITRATIONS WERE NOT THAT GREAT! IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE SHOWN EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO MY FRIENDS.
2,Not so sensational ideas,"I did not find this book to be at all helpful. It contained very few actual scarf tying examples, then went on to show how to use scarves as sashes, throws, etc., which was not my interest in buying the book."
5,Book of Coral Propagation,This book along with Natural Reef Aquariums by John H. Tullock are by far the best I have read. I have bought many. To my amazement The Book of Coral Propagtion kept me up most of the night and thru the weekened. This is technical reading made easy. The result was I ordered differant equipment for my 125 reef set up and will approach it in many new ways.
5,Great shower at last!,I bought this shower head to replace an older (cheaper) rain shower knockoff. The old one sprayed water out every which way no matter what I did to clean out the holes. The water flows from this one evenly and gently making for a wonderful shower experience. It was easy to install in a few minutes. I highly recommend this shower head as a replacement.
3,too gentle,"good product, but the water seems to be too gentle. good overall coverage but you could find better"
2,A senseless slaughter of fine literature,"I have been a Kenji Miyazawa fan for a long time, and upon finding a (fairly cheap) version of Night on the Galactic Railroad, I was ecstatic. Upon recieving it, to my horror, they had changed ALL of the names and severely rewrote major sections. The original names are Italian, and they are changed to lame Japanese names to ""avoid confusion"". Pure arrogance on the part of the translator. The only thing that saves this title is the original material, which still manages to shine through. Buy the other version, or watch the animated version put out by Central Park Media."
1,angry,"I am soooo angry that this is the only translation in print. I want to use the story in classes I teach, but these idiots butchered the story. Miyazawa GAVE THE KIDS ITALIAN NAMES FOR A REASON! These so-called translators are too pedantic, too arrogant, or simply too stupid to get that. Sarah Strong wrote an excellent translation, which even includes an excellent readers guide. Granted, it's not really for kids, but the story was not meant only for kids. Come on Professor Strong, get it back in print!"
3,Ok,"I haven't been able to use this book as much I would've liked to. Maybe in the future as my career shifts, I will need it more."
3,Ordered PF46 but PF46E,I evaluated the AC Delco PF46 and PF46E filters and decided to order a PF46. The PF46E was sent to me. The smaller PF46E was intended to replace the PF46 but due to customer demand the PF46 is still available. Specifications for the two are about the same so it's not worth returning the PF46E but I like to get what I order.Good price and shipped quickly so I still gave this seller 3 stars.
1,Misleading photo and description,"The amazon photo shows 2 filters. I questioned this to the amazon support staff via email and they stated that it comes with 2 filters. When the package arrived, it ONLY HAD ONE FILTER! After again questioning the staff and recapping the info provided, they got back with me 1 week later and stated ""we have researched this product and it only comes with one filter"". Very disappointed as I could have bought the Mobil 1 filter for a few dollars less. DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT ONE FILTER!"
5,Pricy But Worth It,I've been going through a lot of CD players in the past few years. Either I don't like the way they sound or they have a problem with durability. I bought this Yamaha to solve those problems. In short it faithfully reproduces sound and I hope it lasts. I bought this at a brick and mortar store and although I didn't pay list you could probably do better on the internet than I did. Even at a discount you could still pay close to twice the price of other changers. But you get what you pay for.EDIT: Did I mention this player has great SPECS. I guess I just did and the sound you would expect for those kind of specs.
5,Great Carousel Player,"The player is one of the best carousel players I have ever owned. It recognizes and plays all my CD's without fail. I had trouble with my Onkyo CD player recognizing some of my CD's when I first put them in. This player plays them immediately and sounds good as well. I have only a couple of minor complaints. One is the CD Text feature is not available with most CD's. If this feature is important to you, beware. Second, the characters on the display are small and hard to see from a distance. Other then that the player is meeting my expectations."
5,easy to operate and great sound,it is my wifes gift for christmas. she said it is easy to operate and sound coming out of her old cd's was terrific compared to her old sony cd player.
5,Repeat Performance plus,"My last Yamaha CD player (which was my first CD player) lasted 20 years. I'm hoping to repeat this record or even increase the length of time this one works! Fabulous sound, easy to operate. Quality!"
1,Yamaha CD Player,"I didn't know that it was a part of a unit. It didn't have speakers so I was so disappointed because it was a Christmas present to my husband! Usually something will be typed saying other people also bought ( i.e. speakers, amplifier, etc.). I wish I had known!"
3,Music CD player,"The player works, but the advertising did not say that it required a receiver (an additional cost). The advertising did not say that it does not have a pause button, or a constant replay feature. These facts might have influenced my decision, if I had known."
5,Retro convenience ...,"I used to have a 5-Disc Carousel-Type CD changer .. and I've searched for some time to find one that met my standards. This machine is it! Read the specifics on the product and you'll agree that it has all the ""bells & whistles"" you will need .. actually more if you count the remote control. Quality of merchandise and it's dependable functionality are most impressive. I've used it for some time now, as I wanted to wait awhile before rating it. My intent was giving it a chance to prove itself before I made any snap recommendations .. as I'd hate for anyone to think I misrepresented the merchandise if it failed me after a review. It has never failed to work perfectly, and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting the same ""nostalgic"" experience."
4,Good buy & quality,"Mostly user friendly, front function buttons a little dark to see well. Remote is best for most use, esp. song selections.Sound is excellent, crisp & clean +decent anti-skip feature. Play while changing discs is great; pretty happy with this purchase."
1,Target practice,"This unit lasted 3 months and then just stopped working. The rub...when we returned it to Amazon, we were charged a $50 restocking fee. This product is best used at 200 years with your favorite rifle."
3,Display Panel Impossible to Read,"Like many other reviewers, I searched for a replacement for an old cd changer, a Sony CDP-C315, which finally became dysfunctional after 20 years of great service. Since the rest of my system consists of Yamaha components I tried the CDC-697. Yes, it is very easy to set up and begin using immediately. You should be aware, however, of the very poorly designed display panel. The lighting is red, which makes it impossible to read from any sort of distance during daylight. Even in a darkened room the size of the images is quite small. If you want to know what the cd track is or how much time remains on the disc, for example, you are out of luck. The figures in my old Sony's panel are white, far brighter, and larger, so I never had any problems reading the images from six or more feet from the changer. So unless you have incredibly perfect vision and you plan to sit no more than a couple of feet from your changer, I advise you to consider another cd player."
5,Yamaha CD Changer CDC-697BL,Excellent product. Easy to install and use with very good sound plus the convenience of a 5 disc changer and remote if desired.
2,Description Lacking Information,"There was no mention in the description or details that the carousel does NOT rotate when open to load discs. This makes it akward and difficult to load the 4 and 5 slots. For anyone replacing a unit like mine, a Sony, this is an unwelcome surprise. I agree with John W. The packing was poor as well. is anyone at Amazon reading these reviews?"
5,Great,This item was bought for a nieghbor lady who is very picky. She loves it! The one realy nice feature is the ability to play 1 disk while replaceing the other 4! The remote works well. even through the glass door on her console.
5,Great Product!,"Works as advertised, no problems with set-up, no problems with delivery,no problems at all, follow the directions, hook it up and listen to your cd's."
3,CD Changer is ok,"This was our second purchase of a cd changer. The first one we ordered was a Sherwood and skipped like crazy and didn't shuffle, so we returned it. This one, while it does not skip (thankfully!) doesn't shuffle correctly. But I'd rather have that problem than the skipping problem. Good cd changers are simply difficult to find these days."
1,Disappointment!,"Bought this 6 months ago after my third Sony changer up and died, thinking from the reviews this would at least last longer. Nope. Not only was it annoying to discover can only shuffle using the remote, but 6 months later it stops at random, stutters, sticks, and opens itself at random. When I complained to Yamaha they said take it to get fixed, but the nearest repair is 50 miles away."
5,Good replacement for our old and skipping player...,"Replacing a 12 year old Denon.The Yamaha is a simple, no frills CD changer. It installed easily and it is once again a pleasure to have 5 CDs in a row to play, shuffle etc.Easy installation...removed the old one and easily connected the new Yamaha."
3,Sounds good but....,"Sound is great. Clearly a fidelity improvement over the previous player (Pioneer) that died after maybe 20 years of service.The problem is it won't reliably play the assorted compilation disks that I have burned myself. I have never had any problem playing the aforementioned disks in any player, e.g., the ancient Pioneer magazine style player that this unit replaced, or either car player that I own. Very disappointing.The issue that others have complained about with accessing the back disks in the carousel seems like a non-issue to me.I would give this unit 5 stars if it weren't for the aforementioned play issue."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!There is NO WAY to rotate the CD tray/carousel so that slots four and five are accessible. I've bought two of these players and they both had this same problem.I returned the first one for a replacement, assuming the problem was a manufacturing defect. When the replacement player had the exact same problem, I returned it for a refund, and I am going to buy a different brand.Yamaha Customer Support said that this problem is apparently a design flaw. Although Yamaha no longer sells this player, I cannot believe they EVER shipped it with this flaw. I am completely shocked. I used to respect the Yamaha brand across the board, but now I think I'll narrow the scope of my respect to motorcycles and pianos, although I haven't driven or played either one recently, so...Regards to all, Kevin"
1,Disappointed,This CD player played CD's fine for 5 days. Then it would get stuck and just hum after about 2 hrs. of playing. Had to turn it off-on to resume playing. This happened on 3 loads of 5 different CD's. Amazon quickly replaced the player without a hassle. Recieved the replacement..playing the first 5 CD's same problem. Returned this one also. Will look for another brand.
2,Cant see the display so remote is worthless,"I bought this unit from Amazon because it was so favorably reviewed. It works great but none of the reviewers mentioned that the display size is too small, too dim to read from 6 feet away so their excellent remote is worthless. the model 600 unit has the same problem. If you think you can sit across even a small room and use the remote and read the display you are in a coma. I have excellent eyes and can't do it nor can any member of my family. I have to get up and go over to the unit with the remote in my hand to find out what disc is playing and what track. Another lauded feature is text display. If you have a CD that has that feature the unit shows the artist etc. Great idea except you cant read it. To make it hurt even more I have 15ish year old 5 disc Sony that has large LED display and it is lit brightly that I have no trouble seeing from 20 feet away. I rest my case."
2,Disappointed,"Having two Sony CD players fail me I decided to step into a Yahama Disc Player. The sound quality is superior to the Sony but as soon as the unit heats up from use it begins skipping tracks. I have not been able to succesfully play one single cd to the end. Now i have to go through taking the wiring apart, reboxing it, getting an exchange, paying postage and realizing, in all likelyhood, the replacement will perform the same."
2,Won't Play MP3 / WMA music,"This is a well made unit and a good value for the money, but it is not made clear in the Amazon specification page (or in any of the posted reviews for that matter) that this machine will only play standard music CD's - it is unable to recognize or play contemporary MP3 or WMA music files. I did not find this out until I opened the box and read the instructions. I bought this to replace an older CD changer that was also unable to play these newer music files."
5,AMAZING,"From unpacking the box and hooking up the CD player to my amp took a whole 25 seconds, and another 2 seconds to listen to my first CD on this marvelous machine. The Yamaha CDC-697BL is solid and quiet. Horray for Yamaha and congrats to Amazon for free shipping and rapid delivery. I would definetly recommend this product."
5,Great 5 CD basic changer,"For those who want an inexpensive, basic 5 disc changer this is the one for you. The CD's are easy to insert and remove in one step, without having to rotate the slots, and the remote works fine. I'd like one more control button on the changer itself, like ""shuffle all discs"" rather than having to use the remote, since one more remote is a pain to manage indeed. Thanks to Yamaha, for keeping this basic component available to keep the ""rack"" a viable sound alternative!"
2,Yahaha CDC-697BL,Unit would not play when I received. Amazon sent me another one very quickly. Excellent service from Amazon. 2nd unit worked.
4,Yamaha CDC-697BL 5-Disc Carousel-Type CD Changer,Very easy to operate. I have had CD-R music skip but it could just be the quality of the CD itself. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
4,Jessica A,"...[T]his book has a realy good way of telling you what was going on during the Holocaust, but without all the nasty details. The book also has quit a few Germen words in it. The book is not real hard to read, but at the same time not real easey to read eather."
2,boring and not worth reading,If you have read any other book on world war 2 than you will think this book stinks. All that happens is that they move from attic to attic and then they get sepperated then they get reunited at the end when the war ends.To me it's boring but that's just my opinion.
5,A Wonderful Adventure!,"I would recommend this book to parents who want to give their kids a special treat! The story is a very colorful, fast paced adventure. Beautiful to look at, hold and read."
4,70's Sonny,"In the Sonny Rollins cannon this would not be in my opinion one of his great accomplishments. The playing is solid Sonny and larry Coryell is wonderful as well. The sound here is very reflective of the times with several tunes featuring 70's disco rhythms. Harlem Boys is a barn burner of an opener and I fondly rememeber hearing Sonny Rollins perform this at the Bottom Line in New York back in the late 70's. Rollins is the most incredible musician I've ever seen live with a a non-stop flow of musical ideas that is almost overwhelming. Harlem Boys captures that feel for me. THis is not n the same league as Saxophone Colossus, Tenor MAdness , the Bridge or many of Sonny's earlier recordings but it is still very good. I deduct one star for the disco sound recognizing that it was refelctive of the times."
1,Rip-off,You can buy these in the health for store for $1.50 - $3.00 each. At your local Asian grocer for $.50 - $2.00 each.
3,It's up to you,"Likely some people will want just the complete set, without enhancements or the extended versions. On the other hand, this is a classic as it was being made and true fans will want to wait for all the videos in one package including Blu-ray, wide screen and extended versions."
5,Good Price/Good Movies,I had not seen all of Harry. This was good to get them all and I can watch them in order. All DVDs played well and looked great.
1,Guys this is not a complete series!,This does not include Part 2 which is still playing in some theatres ... wait til all off it comes out
5,Who doesn't love Harry Potter?,"I bought this gift set for my son last Christmas, (he was 12). It was a big hit. He was Harry Potter for Halloween this year. Of course Hermoine is my favorite character."
2,Disc skip,So the reason why I gave a 2 star is cause the order took alittle linfer that I hoped and one the the discs would freeze half way into the movie. I would have to fast forward threw it or the hole movie would freeze.
3,You get what you get.,"I'm not even sure why, with the 8-film box set out, you would want to buy this anyway, but if you do, be aware there are scenes missing. From every movie. It's a bit annoying.Also, there aren't many special feature, but I'm not big on that anyway. All in all, I do feel a little cheated by the missing scenes, but other than that, you get what you get."
1,Wait for the finished Saga,"This boxed set is a little misleading. It claims to have all seven years, when in fact it only has 6.5 years, as it DOES NOT include the Deathly Hallows Pt.2. For the price, you'd be wiser to wait for the complete saga, which I'm guessing we'll see around Christmas '11 or at the very latest early 2012."
1,Overpricing without regard,"I find it amazing that a vendor will contract with Amazon to provide product but not feel obligated to offer the same price guarantees on dropping prices as Amazon. Shame on you, shame on Amazon for letting you represent them.Steven Nussear"
4,Good buy,Got this for my son's girlfriend who loves Harry Potter. The movies are being enjoyed with no problems. Great buy for the price. My only complaint --had to go out and buy the part 2 of Deathly Hallows. Would be nice to have ALL the movies come with the set.
5,Harry Potter Collection,This item includes the 7 movies of Harry Potter. The case is the one showed on the images. The one I received was in perfect condition. No complains at all. I received what I saw and was described.
5,Perfect Set,I'm a huge fan of the books and the movies have just been added fun over the years. This boxed set is perfect for conserving space on my DVD shelf with all of the movies except 7 Part 2 in the case the size of a TV Series DVD container.
3,the reason not to buy this,"The reason not to buy this is that they aren't the extended editions that will inevitably come out. If you are like me and are extremely upset at buying a movie and then have an extended edition come out right after, don't buy this or any of your favorites until the extended editions come out. And if you are listening Hollywood, we want the cut scenes IN THE MOVIE, not features to be looked at separately."
1,The Most Insulting Boxed Set I've Ever Seen,"This boxed set is 7 movies in an 8 movie series, and it's not like the last film was some surprise last-minute addition. You get ALMOST the entire Harry Potter film collection... EXCEPT the conclusion! I'm dumbfounded that are people who would buy this instead of just waiting for the complete set, and I am saddened (though not surprised) that 1) the industry has so little respect for the consumer that they even MADE this set and 2) it will most likely be a profitable move for them.This boxed set is a perfect companion to other well-loved collections such as Star Trek: The Odd-Numbered Films, Star Wars: The Edition Where We Replace Empire Strikes Back with the Ewok Adventure, and the Lord of the Rings: Just the Deleted Scenes.The stupid, it burns."
4,harry potter 1-7,product played well. no stopping or pausing on discs.very pleased with the cd set.the movie was very interesting and even adults will enjoy the story and the nonsense.
4,Set of Harry Potter DVDs,"For any of us that haven,t seen a lot of the Harry Potter movies,buying the set is a must & a very cost effective way to do it. The discs are all in perfect order & we enjoyed the series very much.Harry Potter Years 1-7 Part 1 Gift Set [Blu-ray]"
5,Very good product!!,My daughter loved this gift I gave her for Christmas! She is a fan of Harry Potter and this case is beautiful! The videos are all in excellent condition!
4,excellent product for the price,"excellent product for the price,excellent to entertain my nephews and good price.I want to clarify that I am not a big fan of Harry Potter,for a better version you should buy the special edition."
3,missing scenes,"I bought this set of DVD's because I am a fan of The Harry Potter movies. I have seen the movies from one to six at least four times each. However, this set has some scenes that were deleted from the movies that I saw on T.V.Very disapointing."
4,A real joy,"I wasn't expecting much from this CD. I've often thought Jack was the only one keeping the Jefferson airplane musically afloat. I've had this on my ipod (yes I bought it!) for about week now and it keeps growing on me. The track Sweden which closes the CD is great, wonder guitars. This CD should stand up in any record collection along side the best Little Feat ,Gov't Mule and The Ban"
3,Really not needed.,"I had my own small engine repair business for many years. I can see the need for this type of plug in a car, but cannot think of one single reason to put a platinum plug in a small engine. I always change the spark plug each year while I am servicing the entire piece of equipment. Once you pull the plug out, it's just as easy to replace it with a new one each year for about $1.50."
4,Kinks but LEAD FREE,"This hose kinks quite easily and stands out in my yard (bright white for boats), but it's solid and does NOT contain lead so I can deal with those small problems.Most of the hoses on the market contain lead and actually give warning on the label not to use for drinking, pools, gardens, or playing in (spinkler fun or whatever). Believe it or not, the tell you to wash your hans after using the hose. This hose is food grade and one of the few hoses recommended by the FDA."
4,Fun Read,"If you like to see inside the pool hustle scene this book will take you there, Has it's share of humor and some parts that are eye opening. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it. Some of the characters will stay with you and when you're in a pool room you will pick them out of the crowd. I think anyone who loves this game would like to go on the road and win big money. David Mccumber does a good job of fulfilling that fantasy."
4,don't try to prove you're a writer by using words that most don't,"I have read four other stories about pool players and their experiences. All were very interesting and hard to put down, but this one. He tries to use words that are not often used and refer to subjects that an ordinary pool player might not be familiar with. Makes the book hard to read, understand and keeps me looking in the dictionary to get the specific meaning. When of course he could have used a word most people would be familiar with and that would mean the same thing. But to be honest I enjoyed the book and it is worth reading."
5,Great Book!,Great book! Would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in this subject. Very educational to people who want to know more about the pre-war lifestyle and culture of the ex-yu!Warning: not for someone who cannot handle the dark side of humane nature! it is a book about war after all.
4,Rugrats Season 1 DvD Set Review,I opened the package and found the DVD case to be excellent. The DVDs had no scratches on them too. The only time the sound stopped and the picture pixalated was for 5 seconds in the credits of an episode which is fine since I'm not going to go through the hassal of returning it then watching the DVDs all over again to make sure those are okay.The picture quality it just like it is when it aired which is better than some digitally remastered DVDs. My only problem is that the series intro is only played 1 time on each DVD and then episodes go straight to the title card from then on.
4,fun,love it. takes me back to the past! Nothing more fun than recreating memories with your kids that you had.
4,Bought for my son,"I remember watching Rugrats when I was a kid, now my son watches it and enjoys it just like I did."
3,Little disappointed,"I was really excited to receive this DVD (once again way before i expected it) and while the DVDs themselves are amazing, their case isn't. The case rattled when I opened the box and all of the plastic fittings inside were broken. This means that at least one and sometimes two, of the discs inside the case are free to slide around whenever it's moved. The third disc in particular seems a little scratched and there is a slight issue with one of the episodes because of this. Luckily the small amount of static only occurs during the last few seconds of an episode and the credits. I'm not sure if this is an issue with the postal service or the seller :)."
4,Rugrats Season 1,"I am very pleased with this DVD set now that I have it. I have a RCA DVD Recorder player a Sony DVD player,and a Sony Google TV Blue - ray DVD and the Rugrats set plays with no problem on all three.I'm now waiting for season 2 in the mail. I hope to see the complete Rugrats box sets released soon.Rugrats Season 1 (3 Disc Set)"
4,Finally arriving on DVD - season one.,"Season one of the Rugrats on DVD? Awesome! There are few problems with this set. For one, the case isn't what I think a season-DVD should be. Instead of being a paper box, it's plastic. It just isn't what I'm used to. That's the minor thing. The bigger thing that is sort of unfortunate is the price. $29 for 13 episodes is just a little too expensive. Those two reasons (mainly the second) are why I give this a four out of five rating. Other than that, keep them coming!"
4,Rugrats season 1,Only problem with the disc was one of the shows is damaged. It skips through and makes it hard to watch.
3,At Least It's Something !,"I love the Rugrats. It's one of my favourite Nicktoons. After years of waiting, we're finally getting the show on dvd. Sure, they didn't do any remastering, so the picture quality is a bit soft, but who cares ? We weren't going to get the show any other way except CreateSpace, since Nick doesn't care about the huge amount of fans that made them what they are. They either start a really popular show, then stop putting it out. Or they never even start the show in the first place. If you like Rugrats, get the dvd sets."
2,Really??,"Nice that Amazon has this available. But $36.00 for DVD-R??? Also, no remaster and zero special features?? To quote Bob Uecker, ""Personally, I think we got hosed on that call."" Nickelodeon should at least go the route they took with the Rocko series and put out an official DVD release. Even though they could have done better with that set as well. They really treat their greatest cartoons and fans poorly."
2,bad game- stinks,"You battle warrior after warrior. Don't you think that is boring? Well it certainly is. I have this game and the first level I played was fun, then the game becomes ssssoooooo boring! After the fifth level, I can't beat these stupid warriors, and I was endanger of throwing my psp on the floor. Terrible, terrible game. Also, the warriors look like monkeys in a colorful spacesuit! I suggest you buy some other game!"
3,"Good game, but save your money...","I played this game a lot when the PSP first came out. And admittedly, it provided me with hours of enjoyment, and it seemed like a fresh take on the Dynasty Warriors gameplay -- albeit the fresh take, visually separating tactics from strategy, was implemented in part to address some of the constraints of the portable platform.However, the PSP has matured a bit since this game has been released, and there are now other games available (notablyWarriors Orochi) that take the elements that made this game fun and take them to the next level.So if you're looking for a Dynasty Warriors game for the PSP, try some of the newer ones first. Then, once you've exhausted them, either come back to this one or wait for a newer one still."
2,chopped up battle field,"It's much like all other Koei's Dynasty warrior games, but the only thing is... (I know it's probably due to the hardware limitation) the whole battle field is chopped up in pieces, first you move like playing a chess, then you select which square you wish to move to, then a small battlefield shows up and you fight in it... Also, if the number of enemies increases, the distance of object PSP will draw decreases, That means if you have many enemies in which direction you are heading, your enemy will likely show up in right front of you out of no where."
2,"Hack, Slash, Yawn...","Repetitve gameplay? Hack n' slash boring platformer? Awful voiceovers? sound familier? how about DW 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!? If you have already wasted your money on 4 or 5, don't bother buying this. just read a review for DW 4 or 5 and it's the same as this."
1,PSP Dynasty Warriors,This game sucked. All the ones for PS2 are so much better. This one just sucks.
3,LAck of modes brings a fun game down,"OF course, like all prevous dynasty warriors games, this one is addicting and fun. The only problem, which turns out to be a big one is that you can only do one thing in Mosou mode. I would not recommend buying this game unless you are a huge dynasty warriors fan."
5,The best Clarks sandal I own,Due to a nerve condition the soles of my feet are super sensitive. I wear Clarks sandals and own at least 6 pairs. These are the lightest and most comfortable ones. I highly recommend them.
1,Very poor format,"This was the first book I bought (I now own 3 others on the 8051), and it is basically all text and very little to none in the flowcharts or drawings to help get the microcontroller programming concept across. It gives you alot of ascii text long program examples with wordy explanations that put you to sleep! The only book I've seen that took the time to explain assembly language programming for the 8051 is the one by Scott McKenzie (his chap.8 entitled ""Program Structure and Design) is worth the price of the book). Another book I would recommed for newbies is ""Microcontrolller Cookbook"" by M.R.James, as it's very practical and easily understood."
3,Missing sample software files -- nowhere to find,"I was working on a topic (5.8.1) and looked at 'sample software' p242. The sample software promised to be on the disks, are not on the disks. (LCD8.ASM)I browsed the given site (and many more) but no reference to the software of the book or any updates (if any).I find no other way to contact anyone but trying this review.Please let me know if I can download the example files (not on the disks) from somewhere.Thanks"
1,Try Another Book,"This book is disorganized, the examples do not work, and it is generally not well written."
2,"Poor editing + sound, hard to follow demos","Even though there is no question on what David Leadbetter's has contributed to the world of golf, the Vol. 1 and 2 of this video really aren't much what you would expect.First of all, the sound is awful, many dialogs are lost because the sound of the wind hitting the microphone. Also, the editing is poor.The drills presented on the video are not bad, but Nick Price, who is the co-star of the video, makes a superfast backswing, not easy to follow for someone trying to copy a movement or correct a mistake.Considering the poor quality of the video and the hard to follow movements, this is not a video that would be much of an advantage for a golf enthusiast trying to improve his swing.Try something else!!"
4,If you go to St Martin you need this,"For the first time traveler to St Maarten, this is an extremely helpful guide and was accurate. I would take it again for the next visit."
5,Bloody Good!,This is such a brilliant single! and got me on to his great albums...... It's not very often that you come across a singer which such sincerity in the songs he sing. And the confessional driven lyric is poemtic and beautiful to listen to....
5,High & Dry is the worst Radiohead song,"Radiohead is my favorite rock band and I own 21 of their releases. The reviewer below said that ""Babylon"" sounds similar to and is inferior to Radiohead's ""High & Dry."" This is ridiculous. ""High & Dry"" is a cheesy, generic, soulless pop-tune. The Bends has some fine songs, but that's not one of them. David Gray's ""Babylon"" is a million times better. Better lyrics. Better music. Better vocals. Better in every way. It's such a peaceful, natural-sounding song, and one of David's best.For the most part, I'm a fan of more complex music (like IDM and jazz), but sometimes I'm in the mood for something simple. That's when I turn to David Gray. No one writes simple, beautiful music like he does.If you're a fan of Van Morrison's Astral Weeks or slow, acoustic music, David Gray is for you. I highly recommend checking out his 1994 album, Flesh, or his debut, A Century Ends."
2,A little too pliable...,"This gooseneck is a little too easy to bend and, as a result, starts to correct itself over time. It looks nice but, unfortunately, is only useful when bent only a little."
1,"worthless, should not even be for sale","I purchased these with the hope they would be an improvement on the short goosenecks that came with a recent purchase of Amp-Clamps; a wonderful invention that allows proper micing of almost any guitar amp without using a stand. Instead, these are really pathetic. They resemble a gooseneck in appearance only. They will not hold any shape more extreme than a useless 5 degree bend. I find it hard to believe a human being actually was involved in quality control of this product. Utterly worthless for the intended purpose, they will either be returned or thrown away. I have not been impressed by anything made by On Stage but this product sets a new low.Save yourself the grief of being suckered into purchasing these."
2,Ridge Racer Lacks Fun,"The graphics for this game was pretty good, but it definitely takes a long time to get used to the turns, and you can get bored with this game very quickly. If you really love racing games then this is more of your speed, but if you are the casual fan like I then I would tell you to say away from this game or rent it first. I have 5 PS2 games, and this is the game that I play the least. I would wait for the Gran Turismo game, only because I have enjoyed those games in the past."
2,"Disappointing, indeed.","I got this as part of an amazon.com PS2 pack, and I wish I had returned it. It's hard and boring, and now it's gathering dust. Save your money for Gran Turismo 3."
1,Disappointing,"This was the first game I played with the PS2, and it immediately put me into a panic. I felt like I wasted a lot of money on the PS2 for graphics & performance & game complexity that aren't at all apparent in Ridge Racer V. This is a simpistic game with graphics that you'd expect to see on the original Playstation. Luckily, I loaded up Madden 2001 next and was treated to some of the advanced capabilities of the PS2. If you must have this game, buy it used. Do not spend the full 50 bucks for a new copy."
1,Ridge Racer V = Ridge Racer 1,"I haven't played the original Ridge Racer game since I bought my first Playstation back when it was first released. However, after making one lap of the track in RRV, I already knew how to take every corner, because it was exactly the same as the first one! What a pile of crap. I blew through all of the Grand Prix's in a day, and I am now thoroughly bored with this game. If you have never played a RR game before, then this might be a lot of fun (I know I enjoyed the original). However, if you've ever played any of the other RR's, you're wasting your time and money with this one."
3,Rent it but don't buy it.,"Ridge Racer was one of the three games in my game pack. In short this game is simply an improoved version of the origional PS1 version. The tracks look very much the same and the game play is identically. On the plus side the game has great music and the announcer actually adds to the game this time. You don't have to place first to move to the next track anymore and the familiar tracks are slightly modified. Graphically the game is great, from the light trails left by the lights to the cars themselves. On the down side the game is very repetative. I got tired of the game in under half an hour. The cars still bounce off the walls as before and you aren't able to stray off the track like in other racers. To sum it all up, my title says it all... ""Rent it but don't buy it."" If you are a racing nut then definitely rent it first, don't buy it without checking it out."
4,Exciting once you get used to the car manuevering,"If you've played the old PS Formula One games, then you'll like this game. It's challenging at first but once you get used to the car manuevering, you'll progress through the rounds.The game only provides two different views from the racer's perspective (in the car and slightly behind the car). The old PS Formula One games allowed three views I believe.Also, when you are playing head to head, there is ONLY ONE view (while in the car). So for those who enjoy a view of the entire car while racing, you are out of luck.All in all, this game is pretty challenging and I've enjoyed it."
4,great fun after practice,this game is a truly fun game for race fans. it is a little hard to get the handle of steering but after you get used to it you will love it. the graphics are great and it isnt really hard until you get farther into the game. the beginning lets you get used to it without making it impossible.
1,"No, No, No... Go away","I'm owner of titles as SSX, Madden 2001, FIFA 2001, Tekken and Ridge ""..."" Racer. And I cannot even stand see the box of the game. I had been played it a few times and its no fun, if you had play Gran Turismo before. This game is a complete waste of time and I will trade it or sell it soon. It had nice graphics but the game play ... big time. My recommendation to you is stay FAR away from this game and wait for Gran Turismo 3."
2,Where are the graphics?,I am very dissapointed with this game. I thought that maybe playing it a lot would make me like the game but no. It has poor graphics. All the cars are the same what changes is only the motor so you can't identify the cars. This game is a bit boring. But I'm thinking to change for DOA2: Hardcore. Before I got Ridge Racer 5 I had Midnight Club but that is the worse game ever made by human.
5,Worth to buy [...],"Graphics are so real, trees, beaches, .... cars, they all look real. ALso, you can see how you drive once you finished the track."
2,good grachics bad game play,"I've got to admit, I love going 311 mph on the airport oval. I also like the morning, evening, and night racing, but that girl has nothing to do with anything. The graphics are remarkable. When you are going as fast as ever and you let off the gas to make a corner, it decreases your speed by atleast 20-30 mph. I dont like the fact that you cant adjust your car and it doesnt give you money, just the next race to complete. It doesnt have enough cars to choose from, but atleast you can win faster cars, engines, and body styles. The track selection is not very impresive it seems as if they just kept the same track and modified it with inly 2 or 3 different tracks to choose from. It certainly wastnt worth the $50.00. The speeds are impossible to reach in real life( I went 311 mph) although that is kinda fun. When you are going that fast it has a major problem of understeer."
2,Can I have my money back?,This game was just a reminder to me why I switched from Ridge Racer to Gran Turismo. The graphics are decent especially in the replay but thats it. The controls are horrible and if the announcer would show himself on the track I would gladly run over him. The game itself has 14 courses (that includes the reverse)and 18 different cars. But there are only 2 different views to choose from. When I bought this I was excited and thought it was the racing game that was going to hold me over till Gran Turismo 3 comes out but I was wrong.
2,same o' lame o',"I just picked up my PS2 last night and I was so impressed with Madden 2001 and NHL 2001 but when I played RR5, I felt like I was being cheated. I am also a PS1 owner and RR came with the console when I bought it. This is the same game with a new paint job. Yes, the graphics are better and there are more cars and tracks to choose from but this is the same lame game. They really didn't take advantage of the PS2's capabilities. Don't waste your money on it. If you don't believe me, do yourself a favor and rent it."
2,Sure hoped for more.,"In brief, a bummer game to have purchased as one of 3 to go with my new console. As others have said, yes, it is pretty, but the gameplay blows. I'm a gamer from the word go, but I couldn't win on the first track in at least 10 tries, the physics are so bad. And if you can't win the first track, you never get to see the rest of the tracks or modes. Control is sketchy, due in no small part to how poorly the developer makes use of the PS2 controller (x button = go, left & right arrows = steering - that's about it - gas is ON or OFF, you're very much just TUUUURNING or your NOT, no finnesse, period - I'd rather play Midtown Madness 2 with my keyboard). The announcer really needs a smack in the mouth, he's so annoying (in his defense, the vapid dialog is what kills the entire voiceover effect). I love driving games, and expected this one to be THE ONE, as it was a top seller on Amazon and listed as a ""must have"" on ebworld. It was very much NOT the one."
2,Rent it first!,"I heard that the graphics were as good as Gran Turismo so I was excited to play this game. Needless to say, my sources were wrong. GT2 on the PS1 has better graphics, just a little slower frame rate. But the real disappointment in this game is the lack of feel in the cars. The physics are that of the original Pole Position on Atari. I am a real driving enthusiast and this game is not up to my standards, or the standards of PS2. And I also concur that the music and announcer get old fast."
2,"Good Graphics, Bad Gameplay","This game LOOKS good, but the gameplay doesn't come close to the graphics. This game has only 7 tracks, and they all look EXACTLY the same. Same tunnel, same water run, same highway stretch. The Gran Prix mode is boring because you race the same tracks over and over again. This game does not keep you playing. I played it for about an hour, and I haven't played it since. Don't get this game unless your a true fan of the Ridge Racer Series. I would wait for Gran Turismo 3."
2,O......K,"When i first got this it was hard. Then i played it more and more, I used the slowest car and i beet the game in about 3-4 hours. The game is to short, when you beet it all you have are the time attacks and the races were you try to beet a fake computer guys(time attack).And how the hell do you get medls!"
3,Ok....ya,"This is a grate game but vary short, once you learn the controlls its over. Also the onlly car i was able to actually drive was the slow one. I really dont care about the slow car becouse i beet the game with it but come on the game is to short and crashes...what crashes?"
2,OK?,"This game is crazy. I thought the theme was good (based on sections of track from #1), but since you had to earn cars, it was too confusing.Multiplayer:? No outside view, no Porche (Poor-sha, because it's German, for people who think it's poor-sh) based racers. What's up with that?If you buy a racing game, save this as a last resort. But you won't need to buy it if you buy Gran Turismo 3."
4,Fun racing game,"It's good fun racing, and a change from some of they hyper real racing environments. A really nice video game, in the truest sense of the word.Treat yourself.This is not a game that promises to change the way you spend your life, nor is it 'the greatest visuals, graphics, etc.' but straight forward entertainment, though I have to point out that the graphics are much nicer than many other games'. This will not hurt your eyes, I promise. Have fun."
4,"Not the best game I've ever played, but still fun.","I just got my Playstation 2 last week and I've been renting as many games as I could get my hands on. Ridge Racer V was the best game I've played for the PS2 so far. I really enjoyed this game, and I think I'm gonna buy it. I gave it only four stars though, cuz it's not a great game but it is fun. I'm not really a racing game fan, but I liked this game. The announcer's actually kind of funny (in a stupid sort of way), especially when he mispronounces ""comfort."" The control's aren't that bad, although I've never played Gran Turismo, so I've got nothing to compare with. I got the hang of it by the second day. Sliding around the corners gets annoying sometimes, as you have to adjust to each cars individual handling abilities. This game brought me into the racing genre, and now I too am awaiting the release of Gran Turismo 3 in June."
2,Average Game - Nothing New To The Series,"I too own the import of this game and while it certainly has flashy graphics it's very shallow and has nothing significantly different from Ridge 4.One ironic thing is that the first track is the exact same track from the first Ridge Racer game. When you play it you think, ""Wow, it looks almost exactly the same as the original"", that's how lackluster the track graphics are.There are also frequent and distracting problems with the game flickering, and the game is nearly impossible to play split screen.I'd recommend Gran Turismo 2000 or Metropolis Street Racer on Dreamcast over this one."
2,Bleh. Don't waste your time.,"I got a playstation 2 (opening day, no reserve ticket, 6 hours of suffering- thank you very much) and bought madden 2001 and ridge racer V. Let's just say I will immediately be returning the latter. Ridge Racer V was a big let down... not only did it take FOR-ever to load between scenes, but sometimes it would just hang up and make me restart the ps2!! I've had no such problems with the other game. Verdict: spend your money on something else."
3,"Not bad, not good","This game is nothing to get excited over, but it's not horrible either. The graphics are ok, but they don't compare to other launch games such as madden and ssx. Basically, I would say this game is about equal to Gran Turismo 2 for playstation. If you don't own this game, I would recommend waiting for Gran Turismo 2000 to come out instead of rushing out to get this one."
1,The truth about Ridge Racer for PS2,"This game [is not very good]I own 6 games for PS2 and this is the only game that causes the console to lock-up. Namco will not admit there's a problem. I replaced the CD with another CD and had the same problem. Namco says it's a problem with my console, but no other game has ever locked up.I heard some developers were having problems writing games for the PS2. I'm sure Namco is one of the developers that has had problems.I won't by another game that has the Namco name on it. Their support is useless.Save your money... don't bother with this game.The best game I have so far is Madden NFL 2001."
1,A total waste of time,"I got this on the cheap thinking that it would be a decent racing game. I was wrong. I didn't know what to expect, but cars that handle EXTREMELY unrealistically, graphics that are just average in my eyes (compared to NFS 2 Hot pursuit and GT 3) and a general unexpected hardness in gameplay made me sorry I got this game. The cars are fake, which isn't too much of an issue but you have to make the fake cars good. If you're looking for a fun racing game with realistic cars, go for Need For Speed 2: Hot Pursuit, and if you want a good driving sim, go for Gran Turismo 3. Rent this if you must, but don't spend a lot of money for it."
1,Will not play,Game cd will not load . Does not work . Game cd looks fine but is a DARK BLUE Color ? First PS2 game I own that is a DARK Blue Color ?
2,Not a good game,"Honestly I enjoy the ridge racer series. Ridge racer 5 did not turn out as good as I hoped. The driving mechanics are bad, I felt it was difficult to race with the vehicles. Drifting is difficult to control at times and the steering can be fustrating. The soundtrack was a bit annoying to me but honestly the backround voice doesnt bother me. Ridge racer 6 and 7 have better driving mechanics in my opinion so I can say it was more fun. Overall, I did not like this game."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I got this game about 6 months ago as part of one of the package deals someone was offering with the PS2. I was quite disappointed with the level and quality of play with this game. The graphics were great, but the realism of the driving engine is pretty weak: no crash damage, no control feedback, etc. Essentially, a poor representation of driving at speed.The car options are interesting, but not worth the purchase price of the game. To put it simply, I beat the game within a couple of hours of opening it, and I'm not exactly what I would call a particularly skilled game player. Do yourself a favor and buy Midnight Club or Smuggler's Run, which were more challenging and interesting racing/driving games."
1,Boring -- not enough tracks.,"This game looks great but is boring...I mean, really boring. I'll take Gran Tourismo or Driver on PS1 anyday over this one."
3,Am I missing something?,"The graphics are great. The announcer is irritating!!!! I chose the ""easy"" mode and made it all the way through 'til the end....is that it??? Is the only other option to ""keep going"" in this game to try a different car and/or difficulty level? If so, this game falls WAY short for me. I wouldn't buy it without renting it first for at least a few days."
5,It's original Sony PSP batery pack 2200 mAh,Great purchase because it is original Sony PSP batery pack 2200 mAh . Thanks Digitalisenterprises.
3,Battery Pack,I am not certain if it is my game or this battery....but it will not hold a charge anywhere near the lenght of time it did when the PSP was new. It works and it is the brand name so I am not certain what more I could have done.
3,"Great Price, but ships from Hong Kong!","The battery works great, the price was great, but the issue I had was the shipping. When I first looked at this product it never stated that it would be coming from Hong Kong. I only found out after I got and email from the seller stating that my battery will take 1 to 3 weeks to receive because it was coming from Hong Kong. The shipping time wasn't really a problem for me (exactly 3 weeks) but the fact that in the description there was nothing letting me know where it was coming from was. I think it is deceitful to not mention where it was coming from."
1,I too got wrong battery,"I also did not receive the battery in the picture. I've called the company telephone number which didn't identify the company just a standard cell phone message. I left a message, but haven't heard back."
1,PSP Battery,"I bought this batter on the recommendations of others, when I received the battery it is all puffy and squishy in the corners right out of the package. The battery wouldn't even charge, as for sending it back it's not even worth it. If these products are not authentic, please don't say that they are and when we receive them they don't even work."
1,Misrepresented and Wrong,"The product shown on the page was not what was received. Instead of an official Sony branded 3.6v 1800mAh PSP battery for the original model of the PSP, I received a cheap knock-off off-brand 3.6v 2200mAh PSP battery. The packaging doesn't even have correct English for the words printed on the back."
1,not very pleased,"This was not a gerat transaction. Shipping took over a month, and when i contacted the seller for tracking info, he asked me who i was. I allready provided with them with all that info and felt like they were jsut stalling. When the item finally arrived it was an extended battery back which wasnt in the description so this doestn fit my psp in the end unless i buy a new battery door. Anyway if you can avoid these guys i suggest you do.BOOOOOOOOO ! thumbs down dog."
5,recommended for pet groomers!,"I am currently taking a dog grooming class and my instructor highly recommended this book -- and I see why. The introduction includes a detailed explanation of the entire grooming process, including a breakdown of every grooming tool you need, including pictures, description, and usage explanation. The book includes a comprehensive list of alphabetically-organized breeds, with detailed step-by-step instructions on how to properly groom the animal. This is especially handy for the beginning groomer, but even the expert groomer -- it would be very difficult to remember all of the steps for every dog breed! The book also doubles as a handy reference book to show illustrated breed standards to clients who aren't certain of what look they want for their animals."
3,THE ALL BREED DOG GROOMING GUIDE,The dogs that I groom the most were in styles that didn't have any benefit to the styles I needed in Florida.
1,A Useless Book for me,I am mainly interested in learning to groom and particularly interested in learning about clippers. This 416 page book has only 30 pages of general grooming information and it is superficial. It has less than 3 pages on clippers which was also superficial. If you already know how to groom and want information on specific breeds this book might be useful. For me it is totally useless.
3,illustrations,"this book has every breed that you'd ever come across at work. BUT... We don't like the short grooming discriptions and especially the pictures/illustrations. Don't get me wrong, Lynn Miller is a great artist. Our fellow employees have agreed that we'd much rather see a photogragh or better yet, a before and after photo of some more difficult breeds."
3,Chris Sertzel,"A good basic book for beginners, but for advanced groomers, not so much. Some of the patterns are off and there is some misinformation for some breeds. Perhaps if this book were updated that would make it more applicable and marketable."
3,How is Russia Now?,"The story is about a spy that literally got away from the FBI - right under their noses. He is now (at least one thinks) living in Russia, which I am sure, does not treat him the same way it used to. Overall I felt the story was interesting, but did not come away thinking this guy did that much damage to the US. He just did not hold a very high position and he left after a short period of time. He was no Walker or Ames. Given this was the case my complaint with the author is that he tried to make the spying this lame did as something more exciting then it was, I am assuming to get more buss about the book. Overall the book is a fine effort, Wise has a lot of knowledge about the working of the intelligence agencies in the US and Russia and he likes to display that knowledge in the book. If you are a nut about true-life spy's then this is not a bad little book."
2,Facinating-True Life Story,"A factual depiction about a troubled soul, Edward Howard, the CIA and FBI. I particularly enjoyed it because I knew the person personally for a number of years and went to school with some of his relations. He was always somewhat of a mysterious person, always attending college someplace, but now it all makes more sense."
4,"Clean, crisp, tight","Very good fusion album, not overwhelming or overly busy. Fretless bass sounds nice, Johnson plays melodic lines. The tune ""Sword and Spectre"", part of the suite on the second side, is hauntingly beautiful.This album is hard to find, get it, it's worth it."
3,Scabbard has an odd paint scheme,"A nice sword, but the blade has minor warps and imperfections. Also the scabbard has a pattern of orange paint on it, presumably to give it a ""cool"" appearance. Looks kind of cheesy. (you can't see the paint in the photos)"
1,Interesting Idea ... but,"I was very eager to get this product. When it arrived, I was not impressed. The board itself was a nice idea, and the marked out area for the cards was nice. The rest was lame! Very limited explainations of card meanings and card placement meanings. The graphic design was not impressive either. The excerpt... looks much better than the design on the actual board itself. I don't recommend this item. But a creative person could certainly put the idea of this item to good use and make one of their own."
3,"Good, not great",I would say this is 100% good if it wasn't for the fact that disc three of the 5 was missing. I love this stuff and having a missing disc was a disappointing fact
2,it's ok for what it is,"but i didn't get what i thought was actual music, so i have returned it.- - - - - -"
5,Great Book!,I went to a book signing with my husband last night where we bought the book and met the authors. I watch Stefani every morning on TV and bought the man's version of this book for my son last year. We bought this for my daughter who graduates in the spring. This book is great - it tells you what you need to know in a short and easy format. I highly recommend it!
1,Not helpful,"This ""pamphlet"" might have been helpful to my mother 20 years ago but definitely not for a young woman in todays world."
1,not worth the price,"I bought this book, thinking the same as another reviewer, that it would be about DETAILS, not basic stuff. I was extremely disappointed. This is good for high school students or a high school guidance office, but it's not useful for someone who is starting out of college with a professional career. A MUCH better choice would be The New Women's Dress For Success, by Molloy.This book was extremely thin, 64 pages, and overpriced. I paid much less for a different book that was MUCH more informative and helpful."
5,Very Useful,I teach a class to women who are geting out of bad marriages and have been using this book to teach dressing rules. My students enjoy the book and often buy copies of their own to keep for reference.
2,This single not necesary,These three songs are on the album (LITTOS) Unless you want to collect everything of hers don't waste your money.
2,Poor reliability,"The speaker was fine while it worked. The circuitry just went out on mine, however, for the second time in just over a year of light use. I had it replaced the first time (at half of the cost of the original unit) and now plan to give up and buy something of higher quality. Quite a disappointment."
4,His voice is like floating on a cloud...,"I was on a plane heading back to the U.S. from Europe. The movie on our flight was Notting Hill. And the airplane radio played Keating's version of ""When You Say Nothing At All"" every hour as part of a pre-set program. He made the long flight bearable with his beautiful voice. Needless to say, I found myself timing the radio program so that I could hear that graceful voice every hour. Although, I believe Allison Krauss sings it wonderfully, Keating's deep voice made it even more beautiful. This CD I must own!"
1,horrible,"horrible horrible sickly sentimental ballard, i could feel me teeth rot as i listened. Ronan's voice is boring and the song is dull. Ronan should take his own advice, ie: you say it best when you say nothing at all - in other words sit down & shut up."
5,i think it is cool,i love ronan and i think he is really cute. and who thinks that ronan isn't cute must be crazy
5,aaaaarrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh!!!!! this SONG IS FANTASTIC!!!,THE LYRICS IS VERY MEANINGFUL AND TOUCHING!!! IT BRINGS MEMORIES AND MAKES ONE THINK ABOUT THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIP. GOOD WORK RONAN!! KEEP IT UP!!! ALWAYS LISTENING TO BOYZONE......RONAN KEATING!!!
2,Nothing in the Room,"Like the loft that the lead character envisions, this movie is a big empty space that could have used some furniture. Like a plot, or motivation.What the movie does have is a brave performance by Cindi Williams, some good supporting acting, and an occasional flash of noteworthy imagery (watch for the two creatures in white handing out rave invitations).But that's just not enough to sustain 80 minutes of unexplained misery. Pain without meaning or redemption is like a toothache. Dostoyevsky might have liked this movie. You probably won't."
4,Mesmerizing,"Most people who have seen this hate it. I saw it, and I loved it. In fact, it is spellbinding. The music is hypnotic, transfixing. The performance by Cyndi Williams is amazing. This is an experience you just sit back and let wash over you. Quite frankly, I haven't been this impressed since ""Eyes Wide Shut"" by Kubrick. I'm not saying Kyle Henry is the second coming of Stanley, but it definitely has the ability to put you in a trance. Hopefully this dvd is anamorphic 16x9 and has a commentary track with the director and Cyndi. No, this isn't a tidy little film that wraps up everything conveniently. It opens itself up to interpretation. I get it."
3,Excellant read!,"I'm very fussy about the westerns I read. I don't like graphic violence or language, but when it comes to action and suspense, this book has it all! The only thing that irritated me was the way Bat Masterson was portrayed, more as a frontier hick than a frontier gentleman. Was a bit disappointed that the ex-marshal/friend of Kilcoyn and Kilcoyn himself didn't have an old fashioned, face to face shoot-out. Otherwise, western enthusiasts, and action lovers will enjoy this novel."
5,Great One!,"I got this CD today after hearing my friends ""before the storm"" CD and i got to admit that Darude you sure do create great music! Hope to see more CD's in the near future"
3,Should have take MORE time,"I'm a little surprised by these reviews. I think a lot of people were looking forward to this release, including myself BUT after listening to a few tracks it just doesn't add up to the previous release. Now I understand most real listerns are tired of 'sandstorm' but that was a completly new sound. MY thought is this is not really a new sound at all or a repeat of a successful sound."
3,Rushed,"Darude made one of the best techno/dance albums a few years ago. Their awesome sound was played everywhere and sond such as ""Sandstorm"" ""Feel the beat"" and ""Out of Control"" were among the best singles to date, this album is not such a revelation, the fast darude sound is somehow gone and many songs are going in a slower tempo, the hit single ""Music"" flopped on the european charts aswell. I do like slower songs but the hit songs are lacking, some more time would perhaps helped them to make this album better."
4,DARUDE HAS FOUND HIS STLY!,"FINALLY... DARUDE HAS FOUND HIS OWN STYLE! YOU CAN TELL THAT HE IN FACT HAS SPEND MORE TIME IN SELECTING AND ARRANGING THIS TRACKS THAN ON HIS PREVIOUS CD . THE LATEST CD 'RUSH' IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN THE HIS FIRST EFFORT. 100% TRANCE!HIGHLIGHTS ... MUSIC, RUSH, PASSING BY & BITTER SWEET.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
4,"No Calm, but recommend","Not a bad disc, but I expected more. I suppose it is tough to follow up Calm. This album is little more than a collection of songs, I feel no flow throughout the tracks. Overall I recommend if you have extra $$ sitting around, but there are numerous better albums out there. If you do buy, check out # 5, 'Healing', it is the best song."
1,The headset didn't work!,"I did everything the instructions said, including installing the 4 AA batteries before attempting to use.. But for some reason, when I plugged the included headset into its port, the speakerphone shut off like it should have, but there was no sound in the headset speaker. When I picked up a different phone, I could hear what I was saying into the headset, but no sound was coming out of it.Also, when using the speakerphone, I noticed that the sound had some ""quiet intervals""; the sound would stop for a second or two. This became very annoying, so I just gave up with this phone altogether. I plan on returning it."
1,Not good,"This book is old. At the time of publication I'm sure it was great, but in 2011 the pictures in this book are just incredibly low quality. I was really disappointed."
2,Not the quality,"Not the quality one might think for the price. I received the set in a box, and one of the canisters was oval at the top instead of round for the lid to fit. With very little pressure, I was able to reshape the top! It is 18/0 and not 18/8. There are other stainless steel canisters of higher quality for the same price.... I'm returning these and going for one of them."
1,Not to buy,Oh this product is very bad. Please do not buy it. I bought this and within 15 days of buying and using I started getting rust dots on it. It is not made of 100% steel as they say it. My advice not to buy it.
4,Oggi Stainless Steel Canisters,"Very pleased with the canisters overall. The only issue was I don't recall if the description of the canisters indicated that the covers were see-through rather than solid. I was expecting solid covers. Other than that, they look perfect in our kitchen."
5,The perfect gift for a portrait lover.,"I gave this book to my girlfriend on her birthday, and she told me it was the best gift she ever received. I'm a photo lover too, and i must say that everytime i open this book, i find new faces and colors. Presented in an excelent edition. I recommend to all travel/portraits photographers. And the price is a bargain."
3,Enjoyable but abit oversaturated,"I have met Steve McCurry and viewed his slide presentation and am enchanted by his work. He captures his subject's mood and environment with a beautiful quality of light and color. Although I found it hard to maintain my enthusiam as there are so many images and no accompanying story with any of the images. I also wish that the book had been printed in a larger size. All the images are roughly 5x7 and larger images would have really made me feel as if the subjects were looking back at me. But please do not misinterpret this review, the book is a bargain. It is filled with pages and pages of wonderful images of people from areas many of us will never have the opportunity to visit, much less photograph with such intimacy. A great gift and a nice addition to anyone's table. I just wished it was bigger and had some text."
5,Captured Expressions,"I absolutely love this book. Yes, it is just pictures of faces, but it's certainly not boring. Since we look at faces everyday, and react to the expressions on them, it makes sense that these photos attract our attention. The emotions that McCurry captures are very well expressed and they give you an idea of how people around the world really feel. Most importantly, you can tell they are true emotions and not just posed pictures."
1,Insulting,"I am a Steve McCurry fan. His National Geo photos are stunning. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this composite of his work. The ad failed to show or i didn't notice that the book is about 5 x7 in size. My cover did not have the portrait pictured above; it had a somewhat poorly lit, mud covered child. Inside the 5 x 7 cover is a mish mash of much smaller pictures. It looks like perhaps it was assembled as a Christmas card book. For somebody who is skilled and gifted as Mr. McCurry, it is insulting to see his prized work reduced to small undramatic pictures. Grrrrr. My fault for assuming a photo book would have large photos in it. i would not recommend this book for anybody who is a fan of McCurrys and would certainly not recommend it for anybody unfamiliar with his work."
3,"Lots of pictures, but of poor print quality.","There are many wonderful and insightful portraits in this collection. Sadly though, the publishers skimmed on the printing and left this book sadly wanting in quality. However, the photos show an impressive breadth of society. From a child monk in saffron leaning against a stoop in Angkor Wat to a machete weilding farmer in Philippines, McCurry lays before us the depth of humanity. For the low price of under [money], it is a good deal. But only three stars for the small postcard size pages and poor print quality."
5,If the human spirit could be photographed....,"Steve McCurry would do it, and I think he has in this portrait compilation. I really love this book. Its well worth the price you pay. I agree that it would make an excellent gift. Its funny, I keep it on my desk and am amused when my visitors pick it up and can't stop turning pages! These pictures speak to you. An avid 5 stars here!"
1,Horrible presentation,"Very disappointed in the presentation of this ""hard back."" It's very small - about 5by7. And there are no captions providing any information on the photographs. But the size of the book is the big one for me. I would have gladly paid considerably more to have a proper coffee table book. But as it is, it's too embarassing to put out."
5,Amazing,"This book of pictures is amazing. I keep the book on my desk at work and am continually hearing people exclaim over the pictures. Many of them are simply portraits, but many of the pictures make a strong statement. A moving book for any who have traveled in the ""real"" world."
2,disappointing,the photographs when seen in national geographic's publications are indeed beautiful. that is why it is such a pity that they are compiled in a small book that is hard to open and is rather flatly printed.
5,Haunting Photographs,"These portraits are among the most beautiful I have ever seen. McCurry's work stands as a testament to the almost divine spirit of humanity under any circumstance. Because many of the young subjects were photographed a decade or two before military conflict, their expressions are even more haunting. I highly recommend this book."
5,How beauty can still prevail over pain and misery,"As an outsider, you can see that an afghan-child has many different faces. Some have asian features, some have blue eyes, some have green eye, and some have brown eyes. Its proof of how rich and beautiful the country of Afghanistan once was. Filled with different ethnic groups living in peace under one nation. A must for your book collection. Plus, price was great!Best"
5,Great gift!,"This collection of magnificent portraits makes a wonderful gift or coffee-table purchase. Steve McCurry (fellow Penn Stater and my all-time favorite photographer) has such a unique and remarkable gift - he captures the soul of the individual, whether two months old or one hundred years old, in a seemingly effortless manner. His portraits tell a story in the blink of a moment and I find them absolutely compelling and haunting and natural. I can't recommend his works and this book highly enough.If I had to gripe, I would say that I wish the book was larger and that the author had added accompanying text. Although the portraits themselves do not need any written commentary to enable them to be fully understood and appreciated, I was just curious about how he came upon his subjects and what his interactions with them were like."
4,A pocket Full of Portraits,"Here's the pocket-sized and pocket-book-sparing edition of the portrait photo-artistry by Steve McCurry, whose opulent ""Looking East"" I reviewed a few days ago. That book gives you many of the same pictures in a 14""x20"" format, with the highest quality of paper and of printing. This book is well printed, but at 5""x7"" the portrait faces can scarcely meet your eye.There's another way to get ahold of McCurry's portraits, on the covers of the awesome CDs of the Cantatas of JS Bach, as conducted by John Eliot Gardiner and recorded at churches around the world during Gardiner's epic Bach Year."
3,Okay Romance,"To me this book was very slow moving. I had a hard time to continue the book. I have never read a book from Carolyn Davidson before and after reading this one, I don't know if I will ever read one again for a while. Erin was hiding from her inlaw's, she was pregnant, Quinn was a bounty hunter hired to find her. He shows up on her doorstep and Erin was so willing to help him out. I don't know, it was just too easy going."
3,Sweet story...,"I found the plot in this book to be quite entertaining. When you read this genre as often as I do, some of the storylines can become a bit redundant. While this one has many of the elements you will find in dozens of other books, it does have enough little twists to make it interesting. With that being said, I would also caution readers that you will be reading about breasts and nursing... A lot. I honestly felt like a huge portion of the effort in writing the book was spent finding various ways to describe breast feeding. I'm pretty sure we knew about every instance in which the baby got a meal. I generally find nothing wrong with such occasional descriptive scenes; it just wasn't always pertinent to the story, yet it was included anyway. Plus, one of the love scenes was actually a bit, ahem, unappetizing. I, personally, don't equate tasting breast milk with romance, but maybe that's just me."
3,Enjoyable western.,"Cute story as noted in other reviews. Likeable characters. Pretty much standard fare. Nothing special although ""Quinn"" deserves a medal in my book for being dashing, sexy and a saint."
2,Poor Binding and quality,"The content of this book is in line with other books of this type. I purchased this one because it, reportedly was of the highest quality...hence the price. What I received was a poorly bound book, with a cover that doesn't completely cover the book and glue that is already losing adherence. It appears the publisher is no longer making the high-quality binded version but is still charging the high quality price."
1,tweezers - not so good,"The tweezers were expensive for the lack of quality. They have no resistance so when you try to use them, the arms seem to flex rather than being able to grip what you are trying to grip with the slanted tips, they seem to have a minute gap that does not hold. The Revlon black stainless with the slanted tips are the best"
1,"Fascinating subject, awful film","I adore Googoosh and her music. And this has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Let there be no doubt that the subject is fasicinating. The film follows Googoosh's life and career as well as tackling the role of women in Iran (before and after the revolution). Too bad the director, Zamani, is a complete amateur. This film features a bunch of interview clips that need to be heavily edited to be interesting and it keeps repeating the same archival footage over and over again.The repeated footage, along with the use of the triple-take trick are meant to emphasize the director's point. But the only thing they proved to me was that this filmmaker doesn't know what he's doing. There are so many flaws and cheap cinematic techniques used here that I wouldn't even know where to begin to describe them.This film is an insult to Googoosh and to filmmaking."
5,A Wonderful Piece of Art,"The true meaning of artistic documentary. The multi-layered documnetary has many things to say to all kinds of audiences. Fans of the diva can find information about her that is not found elsewhere and researchers who need to know the socio-economic, political and spiritual situation of the country and the nation will find it quite helpful. I recommend it specially to non-Iranians who do not know how oppressed and suppressed the ordinary women and artists are in Iran. This oppression have been there for centuries and climaxed after the 1979 revolution. Good news is that Iranian women have not died and one day will re-emerge gloriously, like what Googoosh did in the year 2000 and during her overwhelming world tour. For so many years she gave hope and promises of a rosy future to a dictatorship-striken nation in a religious third world country in which being a woman is a big offense itself let alone being the greatst diva of all times."
1,Very disappointing film,"I am very disappointed with the quality of this film. While the film attempts to cover both the life of Googoosh and the historical context of her popularity, it fails enormously!The film lacks a central narrative voice and uses badly edited video clips to make weak points. The film seems to have the quality of a beginner high-school film class student. Please do not buy this film, you would learn more about the life of Googoosh from Wikipedia.There are a few positive film reviews listed here. The authors most definitely were friends or family of the film-maker not honest enough to say how bad the film is. wow, truly bad film.- Roya in Manchester, UK"
1,The Worsest Film Ever Made!,"This is not a bad film. That would be too easy. It is the worst film ever made in the history of filmmaking. It's an insult to all documentarians. It's an insult to any art film ever made. The group I watched the film with laughed at the director and his incompetence almost continously. Fortunately, there were no eggs or tomatoes around or they would have been thrown at my TV! It's difficult to make a bad film about a powerful subject like Googoosh. Her story has been woven into the lives of many many Iranians. Kudos to Googoosh for staying away from this amateur filmmaker. Her son should have done the same. The film is ultimately a huge embaressment on so many levels that it does not fit this short review. Buy any of Googoosh's CDs and you'll learn more about her life than watching almost 3 hours of this pretentious, highly annoying drivel."
3,Good video....,but a bit slow and not produced very well. It is only good for people who are interested in learning about Googoosh's life.... and already know and love her.
2,"AM OK, but FM needs improvement","If you listen to AM, this radio is ok but the reception on FM could be better. It is especially prone to interference from strong stations so if you live in an area of strong reception you'll have a hard time trying to receive distant stations. I had a Panasonic radio like this about 10 years ago and loved it. Reception was much better, probably because it used Toshiba circuitry, which I've found makes a great radio. This model, in comparison is made by Sony instead despite the name on the front. Sound quality is great, providing you can pick up stations. If you live in an area with weak reception this radio will work fine but in case of strong reception I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
3,Good movie. Not the correct running time.,"I just wanted people to know that the Forum Home Video version of Chinatown Kid runs at 88 minutes, not 115 min. Also, it's full screen. Basically its the same source as the Ground Zero DVD."
4,Not Too BaD!,"This game was good! But much more needed to be added . Longer Storyline and more characters because the last series was better than this!More outfits, more lasting moments, more everthing!"
1,What Happened?!?!?,"Rented the game and glad that I did. If you enjoyed Fight for NY on PS2 like I did, and think Icon is a new and improved version, you are WRONG. Don't waste your time on this game..."
2,Could of been better.,I was a Def Jam fan until this game came out. Totally changed the whole game to a way that isn't fun at all to play. Good Music though
4,Better than the others,"This Def Jam Icon game is better than the originals. Good game for the PS3, a lot more involvment than the originals. Overall give it a B+, if not an A."
3,RICHARD REVISION,"Casi no lo he jugado, pero esperaba más, es muy extraño no se puede dominar bien a los jugadores, parece que funciona únicamente al ritmo de la música. Los gráficos son buenos. El tiempo de entrega fue bueno."
2,Its Ok,"its an ok fighting game though a little bit on the old side of things, like no vibration etc and they could have made the game better in many other ways but besides that its an ok game to play with friends, and the story line is pretty interesting it hooks you into it, but i mean you can only have like 1 profile etc which really sucks..."
3,Good game if you have time to spare,"I bought the game mainly because I had played previous versions of this game and I had enjoyed them a lot, this latest installment not so much. The players graphics are great and the feature to create your own character is done quite nicely but in my opinion what kills the game is its speed. The older versions of this game where more fast paced this game is really slow in comparison. That's why I give this game a 3 stars rate."
2,why change the style from def jam fight for ny?,"graphics awesome, soundtrack awesome...gameplay...not so awesome. the controls are stupid. they got rid of all the crazy moves that you could do and the game is basically hit as many buttons as possible to win. its very frustrating and boring. no tag team or fatal 4 way either. the game went backwards for improvment except graphics. i suggest buying fight for ny even if you have a ps3 or xbox 360. hopefully if they do a 4th def jam theyll have a way better storyline, more wrestlers etc and bring back the old controls"
1,HA,"my son likes this game....why i have no idea. lol i got it used for 6 or 7 bucks so no big loss , and i know the games old now. i just cant believe how def jam went from fight for ny , vendetta to .........this? the musics good. the fighting, controls, the build your own label story i mean TERRIBLE . ALMOST LAUGHABLE."
1,dumb,does not stack up to Def jam fight for NY york. in this game you can only create 1 character and if you create another character then the other one will be lost that happened with me. in this the environment beats you up for an example a car may spin and hit the icon world shakes kinda lame lame and another lame.
3,tough guy tough music crappy gameplay,yeah it was a nice concept to have fights base off the beat of what's playing. blah. but the gameplay feels like a tank moving. you went from wrastlin in def jam vendetta now street fighting? that's crappy. DJ:V was cool cuz of the story and the cool WRASTLIN moves. this is a big letdown. maybe they will go bak to wrastlin' if not DJ games will continue to be crappy
3,Read this book with an open mind and it is time well spent,"This book was an emotional walk in the dark. It opens eyes to the reality that our safety blanket of prosperity hides. After reading this book, it is impossible for a person not to humanize the poor that are often treated without such respect. However, it did get redundant. More importantly, without an open mind, this book does little for a complete understanding of the situation. It is easy to become emotionally appalled. The author did just that and in return created text so bias that a moderate truth can only be assumed."
3,Overrated (2nd),"This is to stress the point of view of another reviewer: the book was interesting at first, now after 70 pages I clearly miss some structure. We hear stories of different people, unrelated one to another. It is very repetitive after a while."
2,Overrated!,"I have to disagree with the rave reviews this has received. Though Kozol has undertaken a book on a lofty and worthwhile topic his treatise on poverty in the South Bronx is a disappointing, self-conscious soapbox report, which I liken to a teenager's first person school essay. This is hardly the stuff of a great writer. It seems as though people are more impressed with the subject than they are the literary prowess with which Kozol writes; there is nothing extraordinary in his writing, nothing at all. Bad job."
2,I found the book manipulating and one sided.,"My book club read and discussed this book. Some people were moved by the stories of the people. Others, including myself, felt the book was manipulating and only told part of the story. I felt it unfairly blamed the government, society and particulary Mayor Guilliani (sp) for the problems in the Bronx. There was little discussion about how much of the situation was owned by the people in the story. I am not totally unfeeling. I felt badly for the people in the book, especially the children. But I didn't need to be slapped in the face with the story the way Kozal felt I needed to."
2,Content with No Substance,"I had the misfortune of having to read this book for a sociology class. Sure the first pages were interesting, but the subsequent pages were so unvarying that I had to put it down. The paper I wrote for sociology on this book was not hampered by my not finishing the book. Why was my grade above average even though I did not read this book cover to cover? - because the whole substance of this book can be found in the first pages. Save your money and time, ignore this book."
3,a heart opening book,"I'm a student at Dover High School and just half way into thisbook my chest hurt and I felt as if I knew these kids. As if theywere talking to me, describing thier lives. Its very deep andtelling. I usually never cry, but I could not help myself. There was one paragraph in the first chapter that had described a young girl that had died from an overdose, and was left in the apartment, until her uncle (I beleive) found her. Her description was my exact description. A red headed puertorrican with freckles, that looked Irish, and she was only a year younger than I was. It made me think about how someone so similar to me physically can be so different from me emotionally just because of where she lived. That had an impact on me and how I look at things. The whole book had an impact. I had a lot more respect for my mother who grew up in the South Bronx. I never took the time to understand her, but this book made me."
4,"it was great, but hard to keep reading",one thing people generally stay away from is pain... not possible with this bookeye openingshockingenragingheart-feltIt's the most depressing book you will ever love
5,It doesn't get any better.,"Five measly stars could not even begin to do this book justice. Living in the city, and working with poor children, this book had no trouble wrenching my heart. Forget about stars- count the number of tears you shed reading it."
3,not that great,"I sympathized with the people that Kozol interviewed. I also think that this is an important topic and I am glad that it has opened the eyes of so many people. However, I felt that the book was a bit repetitive. I had to put it down because I got tired of hearing sad story after sad story, all it did was make me depressed without keeping me interested. Although I never lived in area as ghetto as the south bronx, I lived in the projects of new york city and am aware that people live in such horrible conditions. So it didn't surprise me, it just put me to sleep. Perhaps to someone who would find this stuff surprising its great, otherwise, don't read this book."
2,its a good book,this is good book for people of all ages to read because i can open your eyes to see what is going in he inner cities of America.
1,TERRIABLE RECORDING JOB.,"THE MUSIC IS ALL RIGHT, BUT THE RECORD MUST BE FLAWED.WHOEVER RECORDED THIS RECORD MUST NOT HAVE PLAYED IT OR THEY DID NOT CARE WHAT THE BUYER GOT. I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING RECORDS OF ALL KINDS FOR 65 YEARS. PARTS OF THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD AND PARTS ARE HORRIBLE.I WANT TO RETURN THIS ONE AND RUSS MORGAN,WHICH ALSO HAS REAL BAD SPOTS. IF YOU HAVE BETTER RECORDINGS OF THESE CDS I WOULD LIKE TO SWAP.I AM LOOKING FOR MANY BANDS AND SINGERS FROM THE THIRTYS AND FORTIES. THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE SPACE TO EXPRESS MY SELF. I DO NOT MIND PAYING WHAT IT TAKES TO BUY WHAT I WANT, BUT I DO LIKE TO RECEIVE FIRST CLASS MERCHANDISE. JACK FINNEY."
3,"Nice poster, but...","This poster arrived looking very crisp and new (as expected). I framed it in a poster frame (could not find the right size so I cut the poster down a wee bit). It has been a few months since I hung the poster and it is looking very wavy. I do not live in a very high-humidity area, nor do I have a swamp cooler, yet the poster is wavy and lumpy within its frame. I suppose it is user error, and not really the poster's fault. The poster (pre-wave) really does look great (as pictured). If you want it to stay crisp, a good quality frame may be a good idea."
4,"Half amazing, half almost there.","I love old Fates Warning, and still listen to it 20 years later.John Arch's return is flat out astounding - if you only listen to the first track on the album. ""Relentless"" has everything old Fates Warning vocals used to have: sweeping dynamics, progression, ebb and flow, decent lyrics, and vocal control that set Arch apart from his contemporaries.""Cheyenne"" just flat out drags - it's *almost* there in a few sections, but a 15 minute power ballad is lacking something. For anyone else it'd be a three star song, just not compared to ""Relentless."" Don't get me wrong, if you're buying the mp3s, $2 for both of them is the bargain of the century - but don't expect to be floored on the second track of the album like I was on the first.That said, I'd love to hear more, and hope it doesn't take over 15 years this time around. If that's it, thanks John. It was wonderful to hear from you again."
4,Pure Vocalist,Nice...I saw John with Fates Warning at the Agora Ballroom in Hartford CT in 83...How a pure emotion filled vocalist stayed away for so long is baffling! I was blown away then...and blown away after 20 years again...please keep the floodgates open John..we need more passionate vocalist in the metal scene..
5,Savory,1 of the best combination of spices I've ever tasted! It is too bad that they discontinued this item? I hope they consider bringing it back!
5,Terrific!,"I love listening to a really excellent singer of love songs and ballads.And, no singer, not even Crosby or Sinatra, surpassed Eddy Howard, as a ballad singer, when Eddy was at his best.There are 22 tracks on this CD. Unfortunately, not all of them are vocals ... and not all the vocals are ballads.But, track #19 alone, ""Don't Take Your Love From Me"" is worth the price of this CD!Other tracks which feature Eddy's beautiful voice are ""Our Love Is Here To Stay,"" ""It Had To Be You,"" ""Rose Room,"" ""You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me"" and several more.My only complaint is that Eddy's opening and closing numbers, ""Careless"" and ""So Long For Now"" are instrumentals, rather than vocals.If you have never heard Eddy Howard, buy this CD, and be prepared for a treat, because Eddy had one of the best natural voices of the past century!"
3,Slow but Good,"Ideal replacement. I borrowed friend's Makita Sander and damaged the pad. So this was a replacement item. Description was a little vague, so I wasn't sure if it was the same as the one installed. It was. Shipping was very slow. Seem like it took an extra week to receive item. I ordered a handle grip for the Makita on a Monday after I place order for pad. I received the handle the following Saturday and didn't receive the pad until the following weekend. I don't remember if company said next day shipping, but it seemed like I got invoice email several days after order. I wasn't pressed for item so slow shipping wasn't that painful."
4,As advertised,Quality product. Made of solid aluminum. Only complaint is adjust-ability of pin retainer. Instructions state should fit most major hitch brands but does not on Acura MDX hitch. Still too loose. Will have to modify myself.
4,More Classic Largo writing,"Climbing accidents and near accidents told in the classic ""Largo"" style. Each situation is colorfully written with lots of humor. Long then technically evaluates what caused the problem, and describes how to prevent such situations from happening. Keep 'em coming John!Just hope you're not one of the people in his stories!"
4,An adrenaline rush with every story.,"An excellent book for every rock climber. Whether your an expert climber or just a beginner, this book explains how a simple mistake could mean your life. Learn lessons the easy way by reading Close Calls by John Long."
5,78 cents and Made by Barilla USA,This pasta stays al dente much more than other brands I have tried. I am so impressed that I am going to make a point of looking for this particular brand from now on. Bulk shopping clubs sell this for $7 per 9 boxes.
2,OK WHILE IT LASTS,"THIS PHONE IS FINE UNTIL THE BATTERY LOSES IT'S CHARGE. ONCE FULL POWER IS LOST, THE MEMORY HOLDS ONLY A VERY SHORT CHARGE, REGARDLESS OF FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS TO FULLY RECHARGE. THE BATTERY IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE. THE WEBSITE TO SOUTHWESTERN BELL IS A JOKE. THERE IS NO VENUE TO INQUIRE ABOUT HOW TO REPLACE THE BATTERY OR WHERE TO FIND ONE. I HAVE BEEN TO EVERY STORE IN TOWN. THE PHONE IS NOW USELESS. RADIO SHACK AND STAPLES RECOMMEND STAYING AWAY FROM SWB FOR THAT VERY PROBLEM. THEY ARE THE ONLY COMPANY THAT HAS THE POWER WIRES FLIPPED IN THEIR BATTERY, AND NO ONE CARRIES THEM. OF COURSE THAT DIDN'T STOP THEM FROM SELLING THE PHONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
4,Well Worth Reading,"I've been a fan of Ashley Warlick since her debut novel, THE DISTANCE FROM THE HEART OF THINGS. One of my favorite novels of recent years.Her follow up, THE SUMMER AFTER JUNE was quite good, if not up to her first.Now, comes her third novel, SEEK THE LIVING.Once again, Warlick proves she is one of the strongest Southern writers working today. There are many paragraphs that you read, then have to just reread they are so beautifully written.There really isn't much in the way of story here, following a married woman in South Carolina, dealing with her brother, her father and various childhood friends. Up until the second half of the novel, not much happens. But, you really don't mind you are so caught up in the writing.As far as her previous work, I don't think this is up there with her first, but I think I enjoyed it more than SUMMER.Well worth reading."
1,Save Your Money,"Save your money and buy another book (The Idiot Guides are great). This book was awful. The format is very hard to follow, the recipes are more for winning ""Blue Ribbons"" at fairs and not actually day to day eating.I would not recommend this book to anyone canning for the first time."
1,"I wish I could comment on the content, but can't read the book!","Sorry to be picky, but the print quality of this book is horrible. I can't read the images or charts. The font size is also below average. I wear glasses, but even with them on, I find this difficult to read. Save your money on this one. There are plenty of other good guides to canning out there."
5,great canning book!,"This book has great ideas, and few really good recipes, my family is huge canners and this book is a good guide to follow!"
3,"It's good, but....","This is the definitive guide for County/State fair entries in my area (Idaho) but frankly, the receipes in the Ball Blue Book (also available from Amazon.com) are much more palatable. If you're canning to win at the fair, use this book. If you're canning to EAT, use the Ball Blue Book! However, the canning TIMES should be followed in this guide for safety (they are usually the same as in the BBB). If Amazon doesn't have either of these titles, check with your county/state extension service. They will probably carry them."
1,An ignominious addition to a canning library,There are numerous books and literature that provide more information in a more in-depth format available to the home canner. Virtually all of the most recent processing time information (ie not 3-4 years old) can be found at your local county extension. Skip this book and spend your $ on the Ball Blue Book or Putting Food By (but make sure to use the most recent processing times).
4,Save your money and search for the free electronic 1st version!,Simply type USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning in any search engine and you will be taken to several pages offering .pdf vesions of the 1st edition. I can't imagine too many things are different. It even has cups and tsp/tbs measurements to make one quart jar at a time. Worth checking out before you spend money on the book.
3,Unclear fuzzy charts,"Good recipes and information, however the charts are fuzzy and hard to read. It looked like they were photocopies of photocopies. Not acceptable in this day and age"
2,book was bound backwards,This book came bound backwards so the last page is first and the first page is last. I can still use it but it's a challenge to read this way. I should send it back but I will only use it for reference material so I'll live with it.
3,It was very easy to read and understand,I liked the book as I am learning to can more than just tomatoes as I made different jams so I wanted to can them rather than freeze.Loved it..
3,Mel Gibson,"My garden has been producing fruit and vegetables more this year than it has in years past. I decided to bottle as much as I could and wanted to be sure I was doing things correctly. I purchased this book and it was delivered within the time frame it promised. The book provided me the confidence to continue on, which was what I was wanting to hear."
5,The Many Faces of Dorothy Donegan,"""The Many Faces of Dorothy Donegan"" was music of the 20's and 30's played in Blues style. Every song takes you back to those times in Chicago. Excellent piano playing from a wonderful time in music. R. K."
4,This item does the job!,"In the desert, where I reside, dust abounds. It is easier to clean porches and patios with a blower. Prior to using this respirator I had severe allergy problems after performing the task of blowing the dust & debris from various locations on my property. Since using the respirator all problems are non-existent. I would certainly recommend this item to any one in a similar situation, although I feel certain that there are numerous other applications. I would recommend the purchase of **several** replacement filters."
4,comfortable,"I carve with a dremmel, lots of dust. I found this respirator to be light weight and comfortable. Bought extra filters which are easy to change but have yet to need to change them."
2,Don't fully trust it,"MSA filters are great, but the ones I purchased off here were faulty. Luckily, I realized that before I walked into anywhere full of asbestos and mold. I wouldn't trust these filters unless you bought them from a legitimate hardware store."
4,Decent Read,Pretty good book. Read Judy Blume books as a kid and always liked her. Not as good as I had hoped it would be but a pretty good read overall.
3,Average,"I've gotten a good bit of use out of this microcassette recorder. However, by no means is it something special, though I do really like the battery recharger/AC adapter. Of all of the tape recorders I've used, this is EXACTLY the same recording quality as the others. I would have given this 4 stars but then I thought about how much I paid for it and realized that it was way overpriced...of course one could argue that they all are...and I'd agree."
1,I expected much more . . .,The recorder has a constant buzz in the background and stops intermittently. It came without a cord to use without batteries. Not a good purchase.
3,okay toy,I wish this phone was a little more realistic looking as my one year old daughter favors an old cell phone to this phone.
4,"Good, but not the REAL thing","I think this is a great toy. My 9 month old daughter likes it, but it doesn't hold her attention for very long and it's never as good as the real thing. It's durable and the batteries last a long time, even if you forget to turn it off."
2,too loud,"Since this is a telephone toy, most babies will eventually put it to their ear to imitate adults. If this toy is put near MY ear and I press a button, it hurts my ear! There is no volume control, and while it is not that bad when you play with it in your hands, when it is by your ear, it is dangerously loud. I love Fisher Price--love the learning home, birdbath and puppy, but not this one."
1,This toy is the worst Fisher-Price toy I have seen.,"This toy was usable in the box for demo purposes. And the volume was fine. When we got the toy out of the box the volume cut down so low that you can not hear it if the tv is even on in the same room. I changed the batteries and after reading the instructions, it stated that the volume would automatically reduce to lower volume after removed from the box for better enjoyment for children. And it has no other volume control. So unless the house is totally quiet you can not hear what the toy is saying. I am a strong lover of Fisher-Price and expected much better from them."
3,Boring,"Honestly, I think this is a cool toy. It has lights, sounds and is educational. I gave it to my son for Christmas and he had zero interest in it, I thought maybe he was too young for it, but now he's 8 months old and still ignores it. He picks it up and looks at it for about a second and down it goes. I keep trying, but he just finds it boring."
3,Laugh and Learn Phone,"The phone is being used by a one year old. He like it OK but has a short attention span with it.. The phone only makes noise for a short period of time. As he gets older and learns the alphabet and numbers, I am sure it will b e more fun for him."
2,ok for a play phone,"My mil has this phone at her house for the kids to play with. it's an ok phone for the kids to pretend with. they don't even really play with it the way it's supposed to be played with. you can hardly hear the voice in it. and it sounds all distorted....they all did in the store. it's some times hard to make out the letter, too. it's not a very clear toy. great toy to play with, maybe not for the educational part...or even to listen to since you can't hear it. i'd get something different for educational and listening skills."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This phone is simply not loud enough. You can barely hear the phone and that is the whole point. I do not recommend it. Trust me, you will want to return it."
2,not worth it.,"my daughter received this as a gift on her first birthday. she already had a sesame street phone, so this one didn't make much of an impression on her. i tried to entice her with it, but it's so quiet...she couldn't really hear it. nor could i. it doesn't really matter if the alphabet flashes across the front of it if you can't hear it."
2,Not that Great...,I bought this toy for my daughter at 6mo. She is now 8mo and has not touch it since I bought it. I have tried to get her interested in it. No such luck.
1,Do not buy for sound quality,"I purchased this toy to teach my child letters and numbers. The toy was great in the store but when I purchased it and took out the ""display only"" plastic piece, the sound quality decreased 75%. I tried replacing batteries and putting the plastic discard piece back in but nothing worked. I finally called the company and spoke to someone who informed me that the toy had to be set to a certain decibal. I told her I could barely hear ANYTHING (I had to put my ear up to the phone) and that the sound decreased so much from the time I bought it in the store. Long story short, I believe this item is FALSELY ADVERTISED. I threw the toy away as soon as I got home!!!!"
1,Money is better spent elsewhere,"This toy is not worth the price it is being sold for. It does not manage to hold my daughter's attention for more than a few minutes. The music is barely audible, which can be a blessing in disguise since the music can get quite irritating. The manufacturers claim that the low volume protects the baby's hearing when held on the ear like a phone(in the original packaging, a thin plastic strip fits a small slit in the back of the toy and increases the volume). But my daughter prefers to look (the few minutes that she is interested) at the lights that flash on the screen instead. It is hard to see kids playing with it as a phone. The toy seems durable, but is very bulky. Overall educational value is low because it does not intrigue my child very much. Look for some other toy for your little one."
2,Boring,Just like everyone else the volume is way to low. My daughter won't even play with in more than 2 minutes if that. They need to do better! :)
2,Wouldn't spend the money for it again,"I do understand that they have a comfort sound level for the young kids with this phone. However what is the point of the screen if they can only hear it while holding it up to their ears? It should have a volume control on it. It is very cute with the letters and numbers. A great Fisher Price toy, but they really do need to fix the problem with the volume. Wish there was a way to keep the tab in so the volume would stay loud."
3,Educational but not fun,My daughter recieved this along with the Learning home for her birthday while I think that the Learning Home is GREAT I think that this toy stinks. My daughter has never played with this and I think that it is too quiet. I have changed the batteries several times but you can hardly hear it.
5,Super strong toy,"This is a cute and colorful toy. It is super durable, which is necessary since I have twins who are constantly yanking things out of each other's hands and waging war over toys. Thankfully I bought two, for which I am grateful."
3,Ring Ring Ring,"I bought this toy for my one and a half year old nephew and he seems to love it..for a short period! Though, I do wish the tunes are much longer! When you press the tune button (the 3rd button on top), the tune is super short and he would have to keep pressing it which loses a child's patience after a short while. It does teach you the alphabet by saying each letter only when you press that specific letter on the phone. Otherwise, it doesn't sing the whole alphabet song which I would love for any child to learn. It's definitely durable and will not break if you drop it. my nephew loves playing with adult's cell phones so I thought this will keep him interested, but he wasn't really. Go for something that can really teach you the alphabet and play longer tunes."
2,Too loud!,"Neat toy, however, the volume is far too loud for a toddler to hold up to their ear. The volume is not adjustable, and is ideal for the child to hold like a video game or a book. I advice shutting the toy off when the child pretends to use the toy as a phone and talk to someone."
3,"Not a waste of money, but not a #1 purchase","I don't think this toy was a waste of money. I think there are better toys out there that hold their attention longer. I have 15 month-old triplets and only one of them really likes it. It doesn't hold the attention of the other two.Durability-- well, my son likes the number 5, and pressed that a lot, and now all the letters have rubbed off that number. Other than that, it handles lots of throwing and banging and slobber no problemsVolume -- I agree that the volume is quite soft. If you read the instructions, it will tell you that it is designed to be soft for your baby's ears. The toy is meant to be held up to their ear and ""talk"" in it like a real phone. The volume is adequate, but I do wish it had a volume control, since my kids NEVER put it up to their ear (yet).Overall I think it's great if you can get it on sale!"
2,Way too loud!,"I have the opposite problem of what a lot of other reviewers mentioned. This toy is way too loud! For now it is ok, because my son is too young to know to put it up to his ear. But once he learns this, i will have to take the phone away from him. I have pressed the buttons and held it up to my ear, and it is extremely loud. It hurt my ears, i can't imagine what it will do to his. I really don't want my child to go deaf from a toy!I will give it 2 stars because it is fun, and my son seems to enjoy it. But again, we will not be able to use it for much longer."
4,great substitute for baby who wants YOUR toys,"Our 6 month old was always grabbing our TV remotes and our phones, so we got this for her to grab instead. We pretend to use it and let her grab it from us, and she LOVES it. It's a little annoying sometimes, but it has a great feature: an OFF button! It's very cheerful and she loves to play with it."
1,Better Phones Out There!!!,Too quiet!!! I know toys do not need to be loud but it would be nice if my 1 year old daughter could at least hear it. Look around before you buy this there are MUCH better phones to purchase!!
4,"Great Toy, But Poor Sound","My son (11 months) loves this toy! I think he likes the pictures, and the letters which flash on the screen. It can entertain him for a long time, and it is great in the car. The only problem is the sound is so low. I though perhaps it was the batteries, so I changed them, but the sound is still low.An overall good toy, and great for those adults who are bothered by noisy kids' toys!"
3,"A great play phone purchase, but needs improvement","I think this phone is made very well and I like the way it has free standing ""feet"" It is worth the money to have a play phone but it can get very boring if you are not playing with your child, i.e. teaching numbers, and keeping him/her interested in the phone, etc. It is a nice teaching tool for numbers and sequence. The large digital display is cool, especially in the car -the light illuminates the back seat."
4,...and it's a good projectile,"It's reasonably drool proof, lights up, makes noise and supposedly educational- what more could you want?"
3,Volume level is ridiculous!,Why would they make a toy with no volume control???? If you are not holding the phone to your ear it is HARDLY audible. I am going to take the tip from another reviewer and leave the tab in!
3,Volume Fix,"I was also unsure why the volume went down after removing the white tab, but I have found a way to increase the volume. Take the phone apart being careful not to separate the two halfs to far because they are attached. Next you will notice what looks like a small black botton switch attached with two phillips screws and four wires. This is the volume control and when the white tab is removed the switch opens. There are only two modes high and low so getting your volume back to the way it was while in the box is easy. Take the switch out and rotate it 180 degrees. Push the botton down and place it into its orginal location placing it in backwards. This will keep the botton down and the volume up. Hope this is helpful and good luck."
2,Definetly not loud enough!,I have a 3 year old and a 9 month old. They both like the phone but lose interest pretty quickly. Because they can't hear anything the phone is saying. I think they would play with it more if the volume was louder.
2,Too Loud for baby,"We were looking for a play phone to help us teach our 11 month old daughter about talking on a telephone. We purchased the Laugh & Learn Learning Phone. Our daughter loves it BUT the speaker for the sounds is located so that it is right by her ear when she plays phone. It will randomly play some sound (a phone ring, a voice that says ""Goodbye"") and we are concerned that it may damage her hearing. There is no way to adjust the volume or to have it make sounds only when we want it to except to turn it off."
4,Entertaining,"My 12 month old enjoys playing with this phone. Although, not as much as the phone by VTech. Because this phone is cordless, it is missing the ability to pick up off of a receiver...a major part of playing with the phone. She does enjoy pushing all the buttons and hearing the sounds."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this toy for my 11 month old to distract her on a 4 hour car ride. I originally got it because it was small and made a lot of noise. It didn't really distract her for that long, but it still keeps her attention somewhat. It's just a mediocre toy, but the small size is nice to keep in a diaper bag or something."
4,Good long lasting toy,"My 2 and half year old daughter rediscovers this toy ever so often. I purchased it when she was couple of months old. It works wells , its durable and not intrusive or annoying to the parents."
4,Fun but LOUD!,My son loves this phone! He received it as a gift when he was 6 months - didn't really get much out of it besides chewing on it until he was closer to a year old. He is obsessed with phones so this is a great gift for him. I love the music setting - he really gets his groove on to some of those songs. The alphabet and numbers are a little annoying but educational. The only thing I don't like - it's so loud if you put it up to your ear. My son usually holds it on his shoulder.
2,we can't hear it!,"My 15 month old daughter loved this phone while we were doing some christmas shopping in the toy store. It kept her entertained the whole time we were there, she seemed to love it, so we decided to buy it. Once we got home and removed the volume tab, the volume dropped so much that she can't even hear it at all. She won't even play with it. When I give it to her to play with, she throws it on the ground. I understand that this is to protect the childrens ears while they are holding it up to their ears, but what baby actually does that? We are so disappointed...it was so cute in the store. I don't recommend this phone to at all, it was a big letdown."
3,Nice but not phone like enough,"My son likes this toy, but i don't think he thinks its much like a real phone. It would be better if you could record your own voice for your baby to talk to. But, the one thing about this phone that bugs me the most is that it says I love you, which is just creepy coming from a toy."
3,Too Quiet,"In the store it has adequate volume, however when you take it out of the box it becomes so quiet the baby can hardly hear it."
3,Not Worth Buying,"This is a good toy because it interacts with the L&L Home but at the same time, sound is a *big* issue. My daughter (then 4 mos old) liked playing with it in the store because it sounded loud but then at Christmas, the sound was very minimal. I mean, she can't even hear it - *I* can't even hear it unless I hold it to my ear."
2,The volume is too low,"We chose this toy over another brand name toy phone in the store because it looked more fun to play with. It was loud inside the box, but after we took it out to play, we can hardly hear the music. We have to put it next to the ear to hear what it's playing."
2,Not that great,My daughter has had this toy for 3 months - she's 11 months old. She has no interest in it other than to carry it around and chew on the antenna. I'm disappointed with the graphics and the music/noises - it's very montone.
1,Can't hear it!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas when she was 17 months old. She is now nearly 2 and still doesn't play with it. I loved it in the store and thought it was a great toy. I loved that the numbers and letters show up on a screen while the phone speaks them. But once the demo tab is out, there's no hearing it. I called Fisher Price and they said it was not defective but made safe so a child won't get hearing damage when it is put up to her ear. I completely understand that but what I don't understand is how a child is supposed to push the buttons and look at the screen with the phone up to her ear. What a poorly thought out toy. I'm sure Fisher Price will stop selling it soon."
3,my 1 yr old loves the toy but has to be alone to hear it,"I purchased the phone because my daughter loves the laugh and learn house. She plays with it all the time. I had read the reviews before hand and couldn't understand why some people said the volume was bad. Now I know why. In the store it worked great. Once I took the tab off the sound dropped severly. Yes, I did change the batteries but that did not change anything. I am a mom of 3. If I had this for my first child when my house was quieter it probably would have been great. Three children does not make this toy great to play with amongst other people, very hard to understand. I have three other phones all with volume controls-- I understand when I put it to my ear its okay but most children don't put it their ear."
4,Keep the demo tag inside the toy if you want to hear it!,"I bought this for my 1 year old for Christmas. We took it out of the box and pulled out the ""demo"" tag (this tag makes the toy louder for in the store) for safety reasons. Well, my 1 year old who was infatuated with this toy when he could hear it (read: in the box) tossed it to the side and left it there because he couldn't hear it. I couldn't hear it either. I was about to send the POS back when I got the idea to shove the demo tag bag in and clip the end of it off, then cram the remainder of the tag in as far as it will go so my son couldn't pull it out and choke on it. It works great, now and it's one of his favorite toys. So, thanks Fisher Price for making a toy that only works properly with a choking hazard inserted into it."
3,Wish It Would Sing Full Alphabet,"I got this toy because my son LOVES the phone. I was hoping to distract him from the real deal and get him to play with this one. No such luck!This phone is a neat toy, but it doesn't sing the whole alphabet. It plays the music and shows the letters on screen, but doesn't sing the letters out loud. I wish that it did that. It says hello and good-bye, but I'm not sure which keys you have to press to hear that. It is fun and makes noise, but not what I expected it to be."
1,Do not buy this if your child loves noises!!!,"We bought this toy for our son and he played with it for 30 minutes in the store because he loved all the sounds it made. HOWEVER, We took it home and wrapped it up for his birthday and gave it to him yesterday. I took it out of the box and couldn't hear any noise--it was very faint. I thought the batteries were going out so I replaced them. Still, very little sound. He couldn't hear it so he did not want to play with it. When I read the directions they said that the toy's volume would adjust when taken out of the box due to federal guidelines or some crap. Fisher Price knows that the sound goes down once it is out of the box. Well, my opinion is--if the child can't hear the toy--what good is it????"
2,As entertaining as a calculator,"If my 2 year old would ever play with this toy I'm sure it would be educational for him. It plays a bit of music and says letters and numbers out loud as your child hits the buttons. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars for educational value was because it says all the numbers out loud except for ""zero."" When you hit ""zero"" it says, ""bye bye.""My 2 year old who loves to play with the regular telephone wasn't interested in this toy at all. There's nothing ""fun"" about it for a very small child."
3,"Looks fun, but babies get over it soon!","I bought this for my 10 month old daughter. She has begun to explore the world and I have notice her love for buttons and things that light up. This learning phone seemed like the perfect christmas gift.When it arrived I showed it to her and she immediately began to play with it. I found that it has three basic modes: numbers, alphabet and music. The screen is a very simple dot matrix system (like the baseball stadium's score boards) and what you can display is limited by the number of dots.My little girl enjoys her phone for about 1 minute but then she's attracted to the real thing: cordless and cell phones... Why? they have light up buttons and colorful screens... this toy does not!"
2,NOT THE GREATEST,"$16.99 is a little much for this toy. It is loud enough, people stare at me in stores and then realize it's a toy. Not educational at all. Music is okay, keeps baby entertained otherwise not worth it. It is an irritating little phone, but it is durable. It's been dropped out of the stroller atleast a dozen times already."
2,It is Okay,I thought that my one year old daugther would love this phone. I was at the store and it was loud and bright and so fun. So I gave it to her for christmas. When we pulled that plastic strip out it got so quite. She won't even play with it because she can't hear it. We have to turn off all the other toys and the T.V. and be quite just for he to hear it. I really don't like it. I think that they need to imporve that. Linsey
1,Unimaginative,"I bought the book after reading all of the reviews telling about how the book was so incredibly great. I read the book and found it to be a extremely easy read. The reading level of this book is somewhere around grade 4. It only took me two hours to complete the book and I found it to be dull and unimaginative. It was predicable and boring. I would recommend: The Au Pairs instead of this book or the Gossip Girl series. I would say not to buy this book, borrow it if you want to read it."
4,Never Put it Down!,"Summer boys was one of those novels that almost any teenage girl can relate to. I found it funny, sad, and full of so many different emotions. There was backstabing, betrail and close bonds that could never have anything come between them. All of these things happen in everyday life and that is why i could relate so much to this novel. I reccomend it to anyone for an amazing summer reading about, love, friends, trust, and boys!"
4,From an older teen,I really enjoyed this book. I didn't really get into in at first but then I ended up reading it in just 2 days. I really fell in love with the story I found myself reading more just to get to the next chapter about one of the girls. I loved the Beth and George story because it relates so much to my relationship with one of my best friends. I even cried with this book and I don't cry with anything. It was a touching and fun story I think it's a wonderful book for teens of all ages.
3,I bought this because of Amazon.ca reviews...,"And I must say, I didn't enjoy it as much as I like the Gossip Girl/A- List books. I found Jamie to be a bit clingy, and Beth was the standard out of place girl with a best friend whose ugly but cute.I also related uncomfortably to Ella. I know exactly what its like to be the girl who needs attention from guys and will do anything to get it.I will read future books. If only to see what happens to Ella. If the author reforms Ella (as it appeared she would at the end of ""Summer Boys"") I will be horribly disapointed. I can tell you from experience that girls like us, we don't go quietly."
5,So Very True!,"This book really suprised me when I finished reading it. When I first bought the book, I bought it expecting it to be like other teen romance books, like the Georgia Nicolson books, or books by the Smooch company. Instead, I got a book that explained emotions that teenagers really do feel everyday of our lives. I never expected this book to tell emotions in suck great detail and with such truth. I would recommend this book to all girls. You will feel just as I felt after finishing it. I applaud you, Hailey Abbott. You have truly surpised me!"
5,Great!,"Very quick read, but I loved it! It was cute, though, to me it was pretty unrealistic. Where were the parents when the teens were drinking and having sex? Great book, though!"
1,Are you kidding?,"Summer Boys is trashy, a waste of paper. The prospect of reading about summer love and broken hearts was appealing, but I could have done without the raunchiness. I got so frustrated with it that I actually stopped reading it. This book simplifies the whole relationship thing; it would have been nice if the characters had been a bit more complex. I think this author has some talent, but it's wasted on this book."
2,Summer Boys became a summer bore...,"It wasn't a horrible book. But it was in no way excellent or anything really special. The storylines were mediocre, the characters were just plain irritating, and it was altogether too predictable.Ella is your typical gorgeous party girl, Beth is the ""friend that is a girl"", and Jaime is the desperate-to-please, clingy girl. They all set their sights on boys - Jaime, her old flame Ethan, Ella, her sister's boyfriend, and Beth, her best friend George.Overall, it's a short read that may bring a little enjoyment, but I wouldn't waste money on it."
2,"Summer Boring, I mean Boys.","Sure this books a nice light read, looks cute and funny. Some may call it ""hot"" but seriously people this book is none of the above. Way to throw girls off with a sexy title, truly, this book is boring. It's really a pointless book that repeats itself constantly, Its all about three girls who are dateing boys, and it's not exciting at all. You really need more conflict in this book. Overall i think this book is stupid. Im sorry if you liked this book, but everyone gets to share their opinion, RIGHT?"
2,The Truth,I don't mean to poke fun at this book but I'm only 16 and I could have written it better myself. This is truly a terrible novel. If you are looking for something to read that has teenage romance and hookups then just buy a Gossip Girl...it's the gift that keeps on giving...#7 is coming May 2004. Don't waste your time on this pathetic portrayal of teenage life.
5,Good,Loved itI felt that it was a little strong at points but it really showed how strong summer romance could be!
5,The Best,"Older people may not like it. But for teens the book is amazing, we love it. I used to not like to read but this one made me fall in love with reading because it relates to teenage girls like me. My friends don't like to read but I let a few girls borrow this book and now they want more and more of Hailey Abbott. It's an awesome read. I hope you would buy it."
5,OMG !,"I cant tell u how much I loved this book ! Summer Boyz was perfect for me! It was exactly what I Love 2 read. Hailey Abbottmade this book as realistic as possible , which up to date activities and shows and books and stuff it was so good to read. I almost cried when I got to the last page :( But Im so glad I read it . omg ! do u kno wat would be the hottest thinig ever ?! If Summer Boys was turned into a movie !!!! I would definetly buy the movie or DVD . I recommended this book to all teenage girls who are interested in reading about love problems because their is a character every girl and guy can relate 2 ...xox I <3 Summer Boys"
1,Not My Favorite...,"This wasnt a very good book in my opinion. I've read hundreds of books and there were only two bad ones: Summer Boys and it's series, Next Summer. Unless your really into short, kinda racy, stories, dont read this one, I just wish someone had told me this before I read it."
4,Good Summer Read,"Although I finished this book in the spring time I think it's a good summer beach read. The situations are timeless so I could relate to thinking some of the same things when I was a teenager. First love, first broken heart, wanting a guy that you shouldn't, etc. This is not the best book I've ever read but to be fair I am older than the audience this book is geared towards. There are a few sexual situations in the book but in my opinion, they're handled responsibly and it is not graphic. So in all, I think ""Summer Boys"" is a good, quick read for teenagers around 14 and up. I would even read the sequel coming up ""Summer Boys 2""."
3,George is a sweety but the other guys are....eh,"I really like Beth's story because it was cute and i came to love George. But, the other two girls were quite boring, Just skip the parts that are about them and read about George and Beth. If you read the back though, you'll basically understand the entire thing."
5,really good book,"this is a really good book. it makes u root for the girls so that things work out w/ them and their boys. my fave character is ella, and i am a lot like her. it really makes me happy that this book is written in great detail, and i suggest it to anyone who cant find a guy worthy of their time. its a good book to read in the summer, and i would most definately buy it. and whats this i hear about them making a movie about it?! lmk more bout that i hope it goes thru!xoxopink suga bunnie"
4,Surprised!,"I was completely surprised about how much i actually loved the book. I found the three girls slightly sarcastic but most of all like regular teenage girls. I have to admit though i was bored by Jamie's story, she reminded me of a previous friend who went through the same situation. Ella's story was pradictable, she reminded me of the type of girl you love to hate. But I believe the best part of the book was Beth and George's story, i could relate but it was just a good story in general. I hope you read the book yourseld its worth the $10 at the store, trust me."
2,A flirt-esque Summer Series Story,"Four cousins: Kelsie, Beth, Jamie and Ella, always spend their summer at Pebbles Beach. Every summer, the four cousins hook-up with random guys who live around the beach- wierd. This summer, Ella has fallen for a rock-star who happens to be her sister: Kelsie's boyfriend. Beth has somehow fallen in love with her best-friend George and Jamie is ecstatic to be with her boy-friend who she met last summer again.This book was a scary, romantic reality story- which I found disturbing and incomplete. I hated Ella, and half-way through the book I was wishing that she would die. Jamie was so boring, and I couldn't have cared less about her. Beth was pretty okay, I enjoyed her story and I was really sorry for Kelsie for number one: having an idiotic sister and number two: being dumped by her boy-friend. The whole book was so cliche' and totally not my style."
4,Great Characters,"This was a really good first novel, but it could use some improvement. Although the characters are strong and realistic, the plot is unworthy of them. These characters are passionate and thought-provoking, but the plot is just a wham-bam shoot 'em up. There are memorable parts where the author shows what she can really do, like the scenes in the slave markets. The end is dissapointing, the big bad guy is defeated and everyone's problems are solved. As if an empire can be toppled by killing just one person. Hopefully in the author's next book she will allow the characters to use their minds instead of luck and violence. Having said all that, I still give the book a 7, because the charaters do make it worth reading"
5,Even my girlfriend read this book!,"I loved the book.. My sister gave it to me with high recommendations.. my girlfriend started reading it while I was and we ended up competing to read it, and she never touches a book without having to! Interesting social dynamic - although it covers slavery it is not a typical slave story. I would like many more books on this storyline but alas, the author has written only one other on the subject. READ IT!!"
2,Get to the point...,"...is what the authors needed to do with this painfully extensive book. Having now read the book in its entirety, I can still say that it contains little useful information and the useful information it does have seems to be buried and scattered throughout the book. One problem is that the length of many chapters (one chapter clocks in at roughly 60 pages) make them difficult to read in one setting, if you have a shorter attention span, or for that matter, a life. This could create a problem as stopping in the middle of a chapter and picking back up with it later may be counter-productive. There is lots of good information presented, it would have just been nicer to have it broken down into smaller chunks."
5,Excellent purchase,"For what I paid, this is an excellent deal. Amazon.com always has the coolest stuff available to purchase that I would have thought I could never find again from the good old days, at great prices. Thanks Amazon.com. I'm a permanent customer."
1,Very Poorly Made.,"The knob that adjusts the lamp head has broken off the studwith the first attempt to tighten it. It was a very poor designin that the stud head was round with two screwdriver like slotsin the head to grip the molded-on plastic knob. Turning the cheapplastic knob just allows it to break free from the shallow slotsand spin freely. There should be a tee bar on top of the stud toengage the knob properly. The other two knobs appear to be the sameway. The people at Designers Edge clearly have never tried usingone of these.On the other hand, the clamp was massively strong, as it should be.Many light clamps are so wimpy they can barely hold the weight of the lamplet alone allow any kind of positioning. Unfortunately, due to the failureof the adjusting knob, I didn't have the pleasure of being able to clampthis light somewhere under the sink or car and not having to dodge itevery 5 minutes when it lets go."
3,I liked it,I think this book was really funny but it was a little short and it kind of seemed dumb that all the girls in the story were obsessed with limited too.Maybe thats because its a limited too book.Probably for younger kids.Ages 8-10
4,Infected,"If you're a fan of Death Metal, extreme gore, or zombies, this is a must-own game. The plot is simple, almost deceptively so. You play the role of a cop who has to save civilians while hacking and shooting his way through hordes of the undead. I enjoyed the character custimization, and playing the game as the members of the band Slipknot was fun. The action is fast-paced, fun, and perfect in short bursts. Any problems? Well, after the first few levels, the action gets repetitive. You shoot zombies. Rescue civilians. Shoot zombies. Rescue civilians...you get the idea. Thankfully, there's a wide selection of weapons to keep the action going (chainsaws, missle launchers, machine guns, shotguns, ect.). I find it especially satisfying to hack through dozens of zombies with the chainsaw and see blood spatter in every possible direction. The soundtrack includes a huge array of brutal death metal, and it really gets you in the mood for some zombie slaughter."
3,No more infrastructure online play,The infrastructure online play has been taken down. So the fun that people describe in other reviews about spreading your infection through online play no longer apply.http://boardsus.playstation.com/playstation/board/message?board.id=pspnet&thread.id;=141022
5,super awesome blood and gore!,"This game is one of the best I've ever seen.In every mission,its all about killing.There are tons of characters and weapons.Plus there is also multi-player.This game includes the game plus PSP Version 2.00.Which has an internet.For violence gamers this game is gonna be a blast and for those who dont like that much violence but buyed it will be impressed.Also there are different missions like:Kill them all:which is self explained,defend:which you have to safe villagers and put them in an airplane,and more.This game is just awesome.Hope you found this review helpful."
3,Not the biggest fan,"I tried playing this game and right off the bat found the controls infuriating. For the life of me I simply could not keep the zombies off of me. I also wasn't a huge fan of the graphics, especially when there are games like FFVII crisis core and GOW Chains of Olympus out there that do very well with PSP graphics. I actually didn't play this game very much, after about 30 minutes I got rid of it. So it's entirely possible I missed the fun part. I guess I'm saying that this game completely failed to grab my attention and not anger me within that time frame. So it didn't stick around for very long."
2,Really laughable animation,"The animation of this first-person shooter is simply laughable. It's very crude. The graphics sucks, too, as you can barely see details on your enemies and you can barely make out your own shape. The control system is okay, but the sound effect quite annoying. The gameplay is rather repetitive. It's no Resident Evil, that's for sure. I think this game sucks and is a waste of money."
2,beat,"not worth it, i beat the game in two days and i didn't evnen play it that much. The mision are all wither aving people or killing all the zombies n a time limit VERY REPEDITIVE. not owrth it even though its 15 20 bucks and the online sucks"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is a bootleg unauthorized cheap version of a documentary. It has a somebody talking about these moguls and using fottage from MTV,B.E.T, videos etc..... to talk about the mogul with no actual interviews for this DVD. It just has still photos and recyled footage from other media outlets."
3,Misses the mark,"The producers of this project really missed an opportunity to share the business experiences and advice from three of the biggest players in hip-hop. Each segment gets side-tracked by the drama that showed up in each person's career. The drama has nothing to do with their career development. There are interviews with each CEO, but they're from other sources. It would have been more effective to obtain new, one-on-one interviews. Viewers would benefit more from examples of how to nurture a business career than examples of posturing, bravado, and drama."
2,so so at best,"This video was ok at best. The production was nothing to be excited about and the overall presentation was rather cheapish and unprofessional quality. The information was pretty dead on however, so if you're just looking for facts about these three individuals then feel free to purchase, just don't expect to be ""wowed"" with the quality."
1,Weak sound,Very poor sound - not loud without distorting. No real bass. FM reception poor too. The AC wall wart adapter is a pain - a straight cord would have been better.
3,smaller than expected,"compared to another 1/144 kit i've got(HGUC #122 AMS-129 Geara Zulu (Guard Type) 1/144 model kit)it's about 1/3 smaller.I know that in ""real size"" of them, Red Frame is smaller than Zulu. But the movable joints are less and some details are not as good as Zulu while both of them are HG level model.I bought Red frame for it has tachi. The tachi is good, but it's soft plastic.It's the easiest one I've ever build. They simplized the parts so it's easy for beginner to build.Overall the products of Bandai are always in good quality. It looks nice in detail.Since it's in a good price, I'll recommend you guys to buy one just to killing your time and have fun with it.My English is not very good, hope you can get my points."
5,Gorgeous Model,A truly fantastic model/figure. Perfect for various dynamic poses any collector or model builder will appreciate.
3,Avoid for Web Development,"Had this book not included ""multimedia"" in the title, I would have rated it lower. I bought the book to broaden ideas for Web design and found little substance. The book is a bit ""dated"": reference to common browsers included ""Netscape"" and ""Mosaic"". It was also very slanted toward a print media background. Even though it was about multimedia? Yes. One section highlighted two primary focuses of an effort: to inform; to teach. The Internet marries the print focus with automated processes (applications). Interactivity is not about choosing what to be told or what to display, but about being heard and making a difference."
5,A benchmark,"In my opinion, one of the best books available on video economics. The text is quite readable for a book on economics, as the models are explained with no advanced mathematics, mostly by examples or simple graphics. But all the relevant information is there."
1,Not working as advertised at all.,"The video ad in the Internet says this can inflate within 1 minute. Not true in my case. I have Accord 2003 and the idle rpm is pretty low. Plugged the hose into the exhaust and the air jack inflated very slowly. The pressure of the exhaust is no where near strong enough to lift the car. I even use my small 1.5hp wet vac that can be converted to a blower. No dice, this needs a lot more air pressure. I'm too busy to return this. I may rig something in future to use this for something else. DISAPPOINTING.."
2,Jacking around.,The jack actually inflates ok but when it is almost full it will shoot off the tail pipe. They need to find a way to keep it attached.
1,too basic for me,"Very very basic beginner's ""I've never braided my own ponytail before"" kind of book. Not at all as described (""100 black-&-white photographs"", ""these elegant braids will be turning heads..."") Puhleeze!"
2,this book,"In the picture and discriptions on Amazon I feel I was missledI thought is was a nice big book with nice pictures, or at least thats how they made it seem. When I got it it was just a tiny little black and white book with drawings of braids.good luckI will continue to shop at Amozon"
1,Lame Braids,Not worth the money. Looks like hand sketches and too wordy for anyone who doesn't already know how to braid. Poor variety of styles. Book is very small and hard to keep open.
3,more pics and less words,"As a tomboy I spent most of my life with short hair. Now that I'm soooo much older and living in a tropical environment I'm letting my hair grow; its cooler to wear it up and easier to deal with the humidity. The problem is how and that's why I bought this book. All photos are black and white, its size is small which makes it easy to carry but difficult to perch on my bathroom vanity shelf. I wish there were more step by step photos so I could have my Spanish speaking hair person do these for me."
3,Beautiful Basics,"This was far too basic! I was hoping to see some truly creative work and gather some new ideas. If you are not a braider, this will be fine, but if you want some exotic braiding how-to's this is not the book to get."
1,Don't buy it,"The book is thin, from the 80's and not updated at all. All of the braids in the book are what I would now consider very simple and common braids, although they may have been new fashion 30 years ago. Definitely not worth the purchase!"
4,Good Value,"The book is very detailed,also has illustrations.It was a good value for the money. I would have liked if the illustrations would have been in color. You would be able to see the finished product more clearly. I would recommend it to others."
2,disappointment,"I had cancer 2 years ago, and with the chemotherapy came alopecia. I mean I was really bald. I missed my hair so much. When it began to grow back, thick and curly (before baldness I had skinny, straight hair) I started to appreciate and love it. I started to take care of it: no more yanking a comb through it, no more rubber bands on pony tails. I decided never again to cut it, but to grow it forever. The BEAUTIFUL BRAIDS book was intended to help me choose and to achieve ""styles for every occasion,"" but it didn't. There weren't complete instructions nor helpful illustrations. Most of the braided styles looked like those a 10-year-old might create. I can do an English braid. I had wanted help with some styles a little more complicated and interesting. I didn't get it."
2,Nothing special!,"This book is really not worth the money, most of the styles featured in this book can easily be found on the internet, I am only sorry I did not read all the reviews before buying. If you can easily do a french braid it is simple to do any of the featured styles. However one positive thing I will say is it would be an excellent gift to give to someone who would like to learn to french braid! I am giving it to my 12 year old niece :)"
3,Miniturized,"Would have gotten better rating if it hadn't been miniturized, bought same guide for grand daughter 8 years ago but it was a 10 by 12 book. easy to read and understand. now it is smaller than a paperback. extremely hard to make out details on drawings. If you want a braid book this is a good one if you can find the older version."
2,updates needed,The book looks to be printed old. looks like it has not been updated since the 70's or 80's. Updated is a must.
5,Easy and pretty,"If you want to learn to braid your hair in a very easy way, get this book. It explains step by step and the styles are beautiful."
3,Thanks,Everything was fine with the shipment but the book was way too small. And the year of book was older then I had thought but that was my fault next time I look better. Nothing other then that. Thank you.
5,Excellent book and service,"The service that was provided to me by amazon was excellent. Even though, they did not charge me for the shipping the book arrived in 3 days form the they I purchased it. The book is excellent and I am glad I used amazon as my book service provider.Thanks"
3,Had to read it for a doctoral program,"I emphasize from the get-go that I HAD to read this book. No one reads books like these for the fun of it.But with that said, I did learn alot from Creswell. The book has a discussion about the differences between quantitative research where you are testing a hypothesis, and qualitative research, which often involves more case studies and social science research.Creswell also highlights mixed methods research, which is what I will be doing in my program.There are discussions about the different approaches to quantitative and qualitative research. The post-positivist approach where it is contended that nothing can be known with certainty. There is also a pragmatic approach and a couple of other approaches.The book was really dull. But I forced myself to read it, and learned some of the basic approaches to field work."
1,No Shipment. No Response,Ordered over 4 weeks ago. Wrote them an email. No response. No product. Not happy. I would NOT trust this provider. I have had to place my order with another vendor.
2,Bad odor,Well I guess I got what I paid for because the book had stains and smelled bad. I don't mind using used books but I must say this is the worst that I have gotten on line or from a bookstore. Oh well!!
3,research design,"The information in the book was useful. However, compared to other books of the same type and subject matter, the book is overly dense and at times complicted and confusing to read."
3,Really not needed,"I drained a 22 year old waterbed that never had conditioner. The water was perfectly clean and odor free. Perhaps the fact I didn't use a heater explains it, but I'm skeptical conditioner is needed."
3,I already reviewed this product. It's fine. It arrived in a torn envelope but probably because it was a liquid.,"I already reviewed this product previously. It's waterbed conditioner so I'm not sure what you want me to say. It's fine. It arrived in a torn envelope, but probably because it is a liquid and had to be checked during the postal process."
4,Bugs and Daffy Axes the Axis!,"While not a definitive collection(hence only four stars), this collection is a great look at how the Warner Bros. cartoons kept up the spirits of the those on the homefront, and allowed us to laugh at those who threatened us(Hitler, etc.). Russian Rhapsody is a great capper to the collection."
5,Educational,"With this collection, you not only learn WWII facts, you also learn about the mood or feelings of the people at the time. Great for students studying WWII in history class."
2,bugs bunny and daffy world war 2 films,I thought it would be all bugs bunny and his films during world war 2 only. Was wrong.It was other cartoon characters too. Could be i misread ad.
3,Good but not the best!,Never Trust Is just not Spotnics but it is a nice cd if you like Jarre or Space. Chart Toppers is just that.... a bunch of Toppers from the good old days.
5,HE SINGS THE BEST EVER: HEAVENLY MUSIC,"WHEN DONNIE MCCLURKIN OPENS HIS MOUTH AND BEGIN TO SING, TEARS JUST START ROLLIN' DOWN MY FACE.HE TOUCHES THE DEEPEST, INNER PART OF MY SOUL THAT MANY CAN'T TOUCH in me with their music, BUT HE HITS IT EVERY TIME.I HAVE SO MANY FAVORITES OF HIS, I COULD NOT NAME ONE, BUT 10.I look forward to his next 'new DVD'. Can't wait to buy it.LOVE U DONNIE"
5,Seeing This Movie For The First Time,"I saw King Kong as a child on late night TV. It was crap. A few nights ago I watched this movie in this DVD set. WOW! A completely different film experiance. This is truly a great movie-and very entertaining. If you judge King Kong by what you saw on TV years ago, you are making a mistake. I cannot recommend viewing the complete movie as restored in this DVD set more highly. A great movie experiance."
3,Poor Video Quality for a Blu-Ray,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.Length: 1 hour, 44 minutesAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 (black bars on the side)Audio: MonoVideo Quality: I would have guessed I was watching a DVD, not a Blu-Ray. The image was not sharp (fuzzy, blurry, soft). I have never seen the DVD, but wouldn't think it would be much worse than this. There was also grain in parts of the movie. Blacks looked good though, and I expected video distortion in the dark scenes. I have seen some of the movies in the Universal Monster set, and they have better video quality than King Kong.If this is the best video there is of King Kong, I'm glad I bought it. But, at the same time, I'm thinking I might sell it, because it is a pretty boring movie. I am mostly interested in the parts in New York City, and that is only about the last 15 minutes of this movie."
5,Great Canadian Show,"The second season of Robson Arms is also very funny. The action centers on the odd mix of tenants in this old apartment building. Gabrielle Miller is a delight as Bobbi. Other cast from season two include Alisen Down, John Cassini, April Telek, Laura Bertram, Peter DeLuise & Leslie Nielsen just to name a few. I've enjoyed watching all three seasons."
4,brilliant description of mental illness,"Set in a 1920s American mental hospital, this tells the story of a young woman's time there following a bout of insanity after the birth of her child. Written in the 3rd person yet simultaneously as if by Marthe herself, we read of everyday life in the hospital- interchanges with the staff and other patients, activities; and in paragraphs of strange poetic prose we see inside the mind of the woman.The title refers both to the snow that features throughout as Marthe looks out of the window; and of course to her state of mind. Coleman was inspired to write this book after her own hospitalization in similar circumstances. It's a brilliant attempt at making mental illness 'comprehensible' to the reader."
2,Interesting Movie of Low Video Quality,"good price, fast delivery, but barely watchable. I expected not the highest quality, but it was the poorest quality video I've ever watched.Fuzzy, Muddy, scratchy describe the picture"
2,Only 2000 miles and seems like already going bad...,"So I had the OEM one in my Durango for 210,000 miles and this one after 2,000 miles is already acting up :-("
1,No booklet!,"I'm so disappointed with the packaging that I haven't even listened to the CDs yet; for one thing, there's no booklet whatsoever (and I bought this new, at full-price, not second-hand), so I have no idea what the tracks are. I'll be able to find out, sure, but still, it's very annoying. Second of all, I'm not sure if this is with all the boxsets, or just mine, but the CDs themselves have absolutely no design on them, so it's impossible to know which side is the playing side except by trial and error. I don't think I've ever seen something so stupid or careless before. What a huge disappointment. I'm giving this one star, even though I'm sure the music is sublime, because I feel cheated, literally.Complete Verve Studio Master Takes"
1,bad customer service/return policy,"I ordered a set of blue kneepads, specifically blue because I needed them for a costume. Paid for overnight shipping to get them here. When they arrived they were white.Not only did this leave me high and dry (had to hire someone to make blue covers for some other kneepads), but I was unable to return these ones...when I clicked on Amazon's handy returns link, I got a message saying that for this reseller I'd have to call Amazon's customer service. I did that, got put on hold, and gave up.So now I'm stuck with a pair of kneepads I don't need, which cost twice the price they should have because of the overnight shipping.Buyer beware."
2,Aimed at a really low level,"I tried using this book for an undergraduate computer security course I teach. I found the level pathetically low, and found only a few scattered sections to have any value for someone with a basic knowledge of computers (like what a first-year student in CS would know). It seems the authors have aimed their book at a general audience; if you want something at all technical, look elsewhere."
4,wonderful coverage of scope,"It covers the complete scope of securityextensively.The chapters are in depth and quiteexhaustive, no stone is left unturned."
3,okay textbook,"If you're looking for comprehensive technical guidance, this is not it. It works well as a textbook and provides a lot of information but I feel that the information is rather general. It would be great for someone just started in security to get a broad range of knowledge but if you want specific, look elsewhere."
1,Terrible book,"I bet the authors never wrote a single line of code for an OS or security software. The book, except for chapter 2 & 12, is basically a collection of paper abstracts. It is indeed a waster of time and money."
1,useless,"This was a required book for a security course at my school, the money would have been better spent on paper to print wikipedia articles which are just as relevant and useful as this book. If you are looking for a book to learn anything about security from, this is not the book for you."
1,lower quality in many ways ('96 version),"Mine is second edition (1996). Not sure how much it evolved since then.I had it because it was required by the class (about 10 years ago). I didn't like it but thought it was my fault for not understanding at that time. Now I know a little better about the field and when I read it again, I found it was really bad: the materials are organized not in a logic manner; it is pretty random about what it covers in more detail, what less - mostly just stacking up stuff, plus repetition without much a point; hardly any insightful explanation beyond copying materials that you probably can find more easily by google or wikipedia; even the text typing and diagram quality is poor and inconsistent ..."
2,"Rated this book, my ratings were deleted, here it is again!","Good book but not for beginners. The author fails to explain many concepts to a level of detail that makes it easy to understand. This book can easily be understood by computer security expert! I spent hours asking these types of questions ""What does he mean?"", ""Why is he assuming I know this and that?"", ""Where is the example"". Hard to understand concepts can easily be undertandable by giving examples. This book doesn't give you examples much. Encryption algorithms without examples? oof!"
4,good but it could be better,"The book covers a lot of the computer security field. You should have some mathematical background that is not very well explained at the beginning of the book, otherwise it is very difficult to understand some of the proofs."
2,"This book from the mouth of experts, to the ear of experts.","No effort on the part of the author(s) to explain to the novice person. The book assumes you know what it talks about. No samples that completely illustrate the algorithms. When you wonder what the hell is he talking about or what is he trying to say, and you say OH!, may be this is what he means and you want to look at a sample, NO SAMPLES!!. Lazyness thrives in this book. This book gets a 2. This book is for people with advanced level in crytology. With all the respect to the authors, a good book talks to its audiance, not to itself."
3,Good material but ....,"I'm not an English guru nor a native language speaker; but I feel bad when seeing typo or grammer errors in a professional book. I have no idea how did some of poorly phrased senteses made it through the 3rd edition!! It's just a bad feeling when reading such book versus a simple fluent web page on the same material. Also the outlining of the book is a little tricky. Most chapters are over 60 pages and they need better outlining. Other than that, the authors know what they are talking about and made a good effort to sort plenty of introductory materail in a text."
1,This information is very dated.,"Except for the cryptography section, this book was of no use to me. At school, this is the required class text but our professor told us to forget about it and go buy Hacking Exposed. I suggest you do the same if you want a more Hands-On practical approach."
3,received a different book,How am I going to review this product when your seller sends me a book from a different publisher? Content is almost the same and I need this book for the computer course. I am not happy at all that I paid for this book but I received not exactly what I purchased but something similar. I expect Amazon to be checking their sellers carefully so they sale what they advertise.
2,Book Shipped never received,"I ordered the book on August 24 and expected recieve date was by September 14. I still have not received the book on September 21 and requested that the seller send another book, which they would have been happy to, while using the standard USPS shipping again, but they would not ship Priority Mail with deliver confirmation so I can actually see the tracking information. Then do not expedite shipping, which usually receive books by the 3rd or forth day. The company claims to be shipping out of Deleware and I receive items from Deleware within two days. I would like to see the company ship with delivery confirmation but I don't think they will acutally do that. Needless to say, they refunded my money and orded directly through Amazon (no sellers involved) for a little extra cost with Super shipper Savings."
1,Nice in theory; does not work,"I bought this device in order to be able to use SD cards for my phone in my Canon camera. It does not work. I have tried it with the SD card with which it was sent as well as three others. None work.Moreover, none of the four SD cards including the one with which it came was not recognized by my XP (operating system) computer.It would have been a nice idea but it just does not work, at least in my camera or on my computer."
1,All smoke and cameramen,"If you want to see Ms. Nova stripping behind a smoke screen and watch cameramen filming one another this is the DVD for you. I was rather wary about buying this DVD when I saw that it was a macdaddy product, I think macdaddy should become a poppa burger at burger king and give macdonalds a break. Save your money."
4,"Decent, but lacking in the ""Comprehensive"" department...","This text is a massive compendium of1) The names of different natural medicinals.2) WHAT these medicinals are used for.3) What is known (if anything) about how these medicinals impact mainstream therapy (i.e., prescription or over the counter drugs).What is not included is HOW to use these medicinals -- so if a patient wants to know, for example, what the safe dose for a particular medicinal is, or how to prepare it, or test another preparation's potency, this book has little to no useful information."
3,natural medicines comprehensive database,"I have a question about your ""new book"" for 62.00 and I don't know wherelese to go to ask. I'm very interested in this book , but I want to have the 2005 edition, None of the info available reveals what edition it is, so I'm unwilling to buy it until I know, can you please let me know?"
1,Not Recommended for any buyer. It does not work properly.,"Personally, I do not recommend this product for any buyers because it does not work as described in the website. I used for 3 days a single flies or insect did not trap. When i read the website it has really good description thus i paid little more but this not was i expected, I now decided to return this product. I do not recommend any buyers waster money buying this item."
5,Always Loved the Pointer Sisters,"These sisters are true entertainers! I love watching the dvd...if you are feeling down and out, just watch this dvd! These talented sisters deserve more accolades and exposure. Even now, they can put some these young artist to shame! The only thing I wish is that none of concert was edited out. I would have loved to hear some of the dialouge the Pointer Sisters were having with the audience...they are so much fun!"
3,Good sounding headset,"My only complaint is that the head set is a bit on the tight side (for me) which is not adjustable. I have a small head so this is surprising to me. If you like a very tight sealed fit, these are just the thing, they completely cover my ears generally well. In a long session and if you wear glasses they can cause a bit of uncomfort being so tight... Maybe in more time they will loosen up a bit?They sound just as I would expect from Sony, very good."
3,not the best deal you can find,"When I received the package, the style of the box that the headphone came in looked really old.The presentation of the item in the box reminds me of the past decades.Anyways, the headphone is good in general, great sound output clearity, fair wire length, and foldable design.However, the down part is that it hurts user's (at least myself) ears after 15 minutes or so, and the pain cannot be ignored.(the cup diameter might be the cause, so if you have big ears, make sure to consider this factor.)"
1,This is NOT a cordless headset!,"Cordless headsets do exist, but not at this price -- I've found out to my chagrin. I don't know how anybody could describe this as a ""cordless headset"" seeing as how the headset has a whopping great cord coming out of it, which needs to be plugged into the phone before it can be used. (Note that it only needs to be plugged into the phone, not into the base unit, so you CAN walk around, if you've clipped the phone onto your belt or something like that.) I'm keeping the phone, because I needed a new one, but I'm not a happy bunny: I feel as though I was conned. A couple of other, minor complaints: (1) the headset only works with the microphone on the left, not on the right; and (2) there's a really stupid flip-panel which performs no function whatsoever except to make it that much more difficult to dial a number. (It can be pulled off, however, with brute force.)"
2,Not a good value,"This phone (at least the unit I purchased) had very poor sound quality and range. I noticed a slight amount of static when standing right next to the base unit, that only got worse as I walked away and behind a few walls. To compare, I did the same thing to a VTech unit that I purchased last year for the same price (but with a digital answering system) and that phone was silent (except for the sound of human voices on the other end).Best to spend your heard-earned cash on a more worthy unit."
1,You get what you pay for,The price of this phone is a reflection of the quality. It is cordless and my particular model will allow me to plug the headset in and walk around but the sound quality is horrible. Withut the headset using the handset alone I think you'd be better off using some cans and string. This is not a high quality phone.
1,Phone did not work - new purchase,Bought this phone for my daughter - It never worked. Charged it and Charged it - all it did was flash and never was able to use it. I returned it.
5,Awesome!,"Awesome CD - A must have for Michael W. Smith fans, and Christian music fans! All in the Serve is the first single - great song. Hang On is the best on the CD... upbeat - your kids will ove dancing to it!"
1,BEWARE ISRAELI PROPAGANDA,I WOULD LIKE TO START BY TELLING YOU PEOPLE SOME FACTS SINCE 1974 ISRAEL HAS GOT 1.24 TILLION DOLLERS FROM AMERICA AND JUST WHO DO YOU THINK IT COMES FROM THATS RIGHT THE U.S. TAX PAYER THAT IS HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE 4TH BIGGEST ARMY IN THE WORLD AND THE JEWISH LOBBY A.I.P.A.C. ARE STILL NOT HAPPY WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. U.S. SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS SUFFER BECAUSE OF THESE SCUM THIS POWERFUL JEWISH LOBBY STOPS DEAD ANY PLAN TO BUILD ANY NEW SCHOOLS OR HOSPITALS BECAUSE THE LEFT OVER MONEY CAN GO TO THEM WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT A MILLION OR TWO WERE TALKING 4-5 BILLION DOLLERS.

5,weather reporting,"This forecaster has made my daily jobsite reporting accurate and complete. Working for a home remodeling company and needing daily data, this tool provides clear concise information at all times. It will stand up to being left outside in some rain and snow without any apparent side effects."
5,Black Dahlia Murder just Amazing!,"This is by far one of the best cd's in 2003 and I just found out about them. My best friend has been bugging me to give these guys a listen and I always said later and later. Until I went to the New Jersey Hardcore and Metal Fest and saw these guys there with a hole lot of other great bands. When these guys got on the stage the pit was F'n insane and I left knowing I had to pick up this cd. These guys you really can't be compare to any one else. The vocals are so different form anyone else. And the musicians in the band are just amazing of how fast they can play and still be on time. The stand out tracks are Funeral Thirst, Cantagion, When The Last Grave Has Emptied, Thy Horror Cosmic, The Blackest Incarnation, Hymn For The Wretched, and Closed Casket Requiem. The hole album is great from top to bottom and is worth your money. If you ever have a chane to see these guys live go and see them you won't regrete it. Thanx for reading"
2,Uh...,"Yes, you're right, this band is not original in any way shape or form, and their vocalist...just makes me angry, this band would be better if all the members were on the same skill level, but the vocalist is just down right bad, while throughout the CD the instrumentals are changing, it sounds as if this guy is singing the same verse over and over and it just makes me want to break this CD...with my ass."
1,Sounds repetetive and again over used...,"I realy do not know what these posers are trying to prove by trying to sound like they're true metalheads when their far beyond from it! The black dahlia murder's "" unhallowed"" is again another trendy and over used bullsh*t mallcore album and band. Die emo kids... Your not metalheads."
4,"i swear, this is some hardcore metal.","okay, the drums, they're insane. the drums make me want to hit people. the guitar is fast and heavy, but nothing especially original (i'm thinking Lamb of God here). if you like metal of the hardest, blackest variety, you won't be disappointed. somebody didn't like the vocals. the vocals would be special if it were one person, but it's two, so it's not a cup overflowing with talent. however, the vocals work really well together, and i like them. pretty gravel-throat, but not too bad. if you don't like gravel throat junk, this still might make you happy."
4,Dissection in America,"Let me just say that Black Dahlia is very much influenced by Dissection. If you're into Dissection, then you will probably like B.D.M. Great melodies and excellent drumming. They mix the deep death metal growls with the high screaming of black metal. Another plus is the price. Only $9.99 for full-length album. The lyrics are a bit cheesy, but hey, that's metal for you.Enjoy!!"
1,OMG!!!!!,"Do not listen to ne of these really good reviews!!! TRUST ME!! i have a ton of heavy metal cd's and believe me...THIS IS NOT A GOOD METAL BAND!!!!!!!! I mean, it's kinda ok but when that really stupd sounding low voice starts singing, it just sounds like a joke. And all the songs sound the same!!!!!!!!"
3,regirgitated elephant monkey,ok this band sounds like a regirgitated elephant monkey. well the bottom line is that they are horrible and i can make better music by banging pots and pans together and pretend i have something stuck in my throat and need to growl to get it out. In the vast sea of metal/ hardcore these guys are the tiny plankton that the whales eat.
3,Ok....,"Well, i bought this cd, after i heard one song from them. the song that i heard was great and they reminded me of the agony scene on steroids. but when i put in the cd, and opned the booklet, i saw the cheesiest lyrics in the world. good music, great style. nice sound. but the lyrics make it not as good as it should be."
5,One of the best in its league,"The Black Dahlia Murder is one of the best up and coming bands IMO. They fused the unforgettable sounds of At The Gates and early In Flames with elements of brutal death metal and grindcore as well. Trevor Strnad's duel vocal assault makes you wonder if there is a backup vocalist? Nope.And don't believe people that call this metalcore. That's ignorant. Now, I'm not one of those elitists who's like ""m3t41Xc0r3 15 1t3h 5uXXX0r"". Believe me, there are plenty of great bands under that genre that stand out and don't bore. The Black Dahlia Murder is melodic death metal/grind all mixed in one whirlwind.Also, check out Vehemence, Beyond The Embrace, Arsis, Enforsaken, Through The Eyes of the Dead and Becoming The Archetype for bands like TBDM."
3,Hmm...didn't live up to the hype for me,"I bought this CD after reading so many great reviews. I even saw them perform live, and it didn't appeal to me too much. If you like fast death metal in the vein of Darkest Hour or The Crown...then this is for you. Personally, I like a little more groove and variety to my music. The vocals are interesting, and their talent is clear...but every song is so fast, and it just gets old after a while."
5,Metal.... Metal.,"Black Dahlia Murder does something to metal that is seldom heard. They mix many different styles, everything from death metal, to more new age hardcore breakdowns. a vocalist that can range as well as anyone, and some of the most metal looking dudes you could ever hope to see. my friend popped in this CD and i thought my head was going to explode, the next day i went and bought it after pawning my turntable to make money. thats how good it is. If you like this CD just wait until you see them play live... unbelievable. The Black Dahlia Murder gives me hope that musicians won't have to cry on stage to make it big."
2,Hmm....,"I guess im pretty much the only one that thinks these guys are way overrated....this album dosnt entertain me at all, the production is dry and 'sandpaperlike', the songs are mediocore no standout tracks at all.... I wouldnt recomment this album."
3,It's Okay...,"I was really looking forward to this release, I thought it would be cool, but instead its something that I've already heard. I mean, it sounds like any other hardcore band. I've noticed that only a select amount of bands in hardcore that don't sound like the rest. This band falls in the category of generic sounding hardcore, nothing new here."
4,Joan Bennett makes this one worthwhile,This version is a nice remaster of an interesting but minor noir title. Paul Henried delivers a good performance but Joan Bennett is the one to watch here. It's a shame the film didn't focus on her more.
4,can vampires truly fall in love?,"in this story the author told a tail of a a vampire who motives in life has taken a drastic change. he somewhat was lost in a cold world searching for something,or should i say someone he as well didnt comprehend.in the end of the story you find yourself asking yourself, if love is actually a true feeling? or is it something decievefull? or can someone manipulate truth to their advantage. overall this story was good, it reflected a diffrent perception towards vampires. the understanding that not all vampires are the same, they are all unique with diffrent gifts. the story was moving, captivating. the author showed alot of passion in this novel i loved it!"
4,I hope you enjoy reading it as much as i enjoyed writting it,I had a lot of fun writting this novel. I hope that all who read it fall in love with the characters as much as I did writting about them. Thanks
3,It's OK,"I'd been using Glytone's KP kit and when I ran out, thought I'd give KP duty a try (had a gift cert.) It's OK, but I like Glytone's product and system much better. My KP has started coming back since I stopped Glytone, along with ingrown hairs. KP duty is a bit clumpy and I feel like I need to use quite a bit to get a good scrub, and lots ends up on the shower floor (compared to a little going a long way w/Glytone.) Don't think I'll buy this again..."
2,Disappointed,"After trying the KP Duty Moisturizing Therapy and being very disappointed, I decided to try the scrub. As was the case with the moisturizer, the scrub has not relieved my KP at all. The only positive thing I have to say is that my skin does feel slightly softer after using the scrub. However, to maintain this softness, I have to use the scrub at least 3x a week, which is more than the recommended 1 - 2x a week. I still have KP and after using this tub for approximately 2 months now, it hasn't been worth the money or the promise of eliminating KP. I am very disappointed and truly wanted and expected this product to work."
1,Don't spend the money....,"I tried Derma Doctor about six months ago and followed the directions to the ""t"", and used the entire bottle, it did not make any difference for my skin. I was surprised because I actually read about it in Cosmopolitan. I was really disappointed just because it was so expensive. I'm going to try something else."
2,It's okay,"This did make my skin a lot smoother, but I think that has more to do with the fact that I was using scrub and moisturizer regularly rather than this particular scrub and moisturizer. Using the Bath & Body Works regular scrub and regular body lotion seemed to do just as good of a job. The bumps were just as red as they always have been. When I bought this a few months ago, most of the reviews were so-so. But the dermatologist recommended it to me, so I bought it anyway. I won't buy it again, because it is very expensive and I went through the lotion so fast for how expensive it is."
2,Waste of money,"I have bumps on the back of my legs, people told me its from shaving and tight clothes you get ingrown hairs, so I stopped both and had no luck. Then someone told I had keratosis pilaris, aka chicken skin. Then I found this cure, supposedly. Well 40 dollars later and a month after using it I am not impressed. I will say it made my skin smoother and it lightened it a tad bit but this is as good as any other exfoliator and is not worth 40 dollars."
5,regency the way it should be!,"What can I say, a Regency isn't supposed to take itself too seriously...and this one leaves you smiling. In fact, you should be smiling the whole time you are reading this book. There are twista and turns, but never for a moment are you in doubt that love will some how win out in the end."
2,In the minority here,"While this book wasn't awful, and a rating of 2.7 would probably be more accurate, I found all those dogs annoying more than amusing. The book is something of a farce, more than a romp. Knowle is obnoxious to begin with, his encounters with the dogs are sometimes amusing, and he does grow on you. It's just that I never cared much what happened to the lovebirds, and so much of the story was ridiculously farfetched. Faulty book."
1,"Never finished it, so maybe it would have gotten better","I really enjoyed 2 other Barbara Metzger books, and this one had some great reviews, so I bought it too. This was too hard to like right from the beginning. The premise of why the hero needs the cottage was too far fetched. Just leave the girl alone and go find another solution to your problem. You don't need the money. I just found the hero mean, and didn't want the heroine to like him. Why like somebody that is so nasty from the very beginning. Leave the poor girl alone!Anyway, I gave up after a few chapters because I didn't see anything funny about a mean hero and a sweet heroine that has to tolerate all that nastiness.I did enjoy Barbara Metzgers A Suspicious Affair and Snowdrops and Scandalbroth, and would recommend them, but not this."
1,It did not work!,Did it work? NO. I tried it for a period of 30 days and no weigth loss. My mother also tried it for 30 days and she had no results. The only thing that did work as promised was the fact that the patch did not come off the skin with normal wear.
1,Jean,"I really like Mario Lanza, but I do not recommend this CD-many of the songs have so much noise it actually distorts the tone of Lanza's voice. I think most of these selections are available in other collections, so choose something else."
3,Good Disc if it were made with La Luna standards,"I liked this DVD a lot, but not as much as her La Luna. She still performs very well, but the DVD menus and navigation are not as great. No lyrics feature. A person in an earlier review is right; her voice does get drowned out sometimes. I think the guy who said she is lip-synching is wrong, I don't notice it. However, I still enjoyed everything else."
3,"Hilarious, Over-The-Top Lip-Synch Fest!","Lovely Sarah wears outlandishly hilarious costumes whilst she mugs and vamps her way through most of her EDEN album, with a few other songs mixed in. She sounds ultra-fabulous (if you love her voice, as I do) and it makes the video even more hilarious when you realise that she is lip-synching her EDEN album (and a few songs from other albums)! I could (and do) watch this over and over. I don't give it 5 because there are a lot of artifacts on this dvd."
5,I love Sarah,"She is the most beautiful & talented performer I have ever seen. Being italian she brought back many memorie's of my grandparent's & parent's, who were very much into music,particularly opera. I cannot wait to receive this video. She is the best. P.Russano Ft.Lauderdale, Fl."
4,No words to describe it!,"Not only is Sarah Brightman beautiful, but her voice is incredible! This video brings you back in time to the last twenty years of her career. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Frank Peterson. Watching it once will wanna make you see it again and again! I really recomend it if you are a fan! It's the next best thing after seeing her live."
3,Beautiful but Disappointing...,"I am sorry to previous reviewers here, but I don't think the concert was perfect to have 5 stars. I'll give just 3 stars. The songs, men's dances and Sarah's voice were beautiful but it's hard for me to experience a real concert feel. I think the concert was just one sided presentation not like being *one* between the artist and audience. Her voice was not vivid to hear except when she just speaks because echo effect was too deep during her singing. The accompaniment sounded like studio version. So, I strongly suspect some(or many) songs were lip-synced (very skillfully). And the stage was rather dark and reddish.In spite of some negative points, some songs including ""Nella Fantasia""(by Ennio Morricone) are too beautiful to forget. I also liked the super jewel case of this dvd, which is beautiful and creative. If you like to hear angel voices, I highly recommend you to try ""A voice of an angel in concert"" by Charlotte Church, a 13 year old angel."
2,Disappointing Video Disk,"The overall production is lush, and while the camera focuses intimately on Ms Brightman, her voice is centered elsewhere. I think the poor management of vocal sound is the principal problem to the detrement of the entire album. Her voice sounds as if it were emanating from a shower stall down and off stage, while the strings, horns and percussion have the up stage sound presence.I presume Ms Brightman has a glorious voice. Too bad the sound people did not release it unharmed. I am extremely disappointed overall with Sarah Brightman's One Night in Eden DVD."
1,La Estafa Mas Grande,"Aunque reconozco que Sarah Brightman tiene una de las voces más espectaculares y hermosas de nuestro tiempo, no puedo dejar de pensar que este video (One Night In Eden) que reproduce su concierto en Sudáfrica, es una burla para cualquier amante de la buena música.Muy bien lograda y demás decir que hermosa su presentación en escena, pero obviaron por completo el sonido original del concierto, haciendo una remezcla muy clara de lo que son sus grabaciones en estudio. Para ello, es preferible comprar de una vez sus CDs de audio, y ahorrarse dinero en esta estafa tan grande como lo es este video.Simone Di StefanoVenezuela"
1,What is this?,I strongly recommend you to rent this DVD before buying - I am sure it will save you some good money.- I kept asking myself while I was watching it: - what is this? what is this? - and before you might think I am an old-obscure-dark-fashion person - I tell you I am not.
1,Amazing... Hail the Queen of Lip-synching!!!,"I am sure that all the performances except a few songs were lip-synched. I think she actually sang only ""Wishing you were somehow here again"", ""Music of the Night"" and ""Time to Say Good-bye"". You will notice it easily if you compare the difference of the sound between those three and others. Obviously, lip-synched songs sounded very weak lacking ""her spirit"". ""Deliver Me"" is a clear example. It even made me laugh.(Look at the choir who don't seem like as skillful as Ms. Brightman in lip-synching!) What a disappoinment!!! I don't understand why she chose that way. Maybe she is too old to actually sing many songs in a row before audience without technical support. Ms. Brightman, I don't want to see your appearance, stage manner or dancing. I just want to see you sing with your passion communicating spiritually with the audience. If you can't sing, simply quit singing, please..."
5,"Marshall Fine's Editorial Review is ""Out-to-lunch""","Marshall Fine Editorial Review is clearly ""out-to-lunch"". Sarah Brightman can sing me to sleep any time. Her voice is angelic and I would shadow her door any day."
3,Shoot the sound man!,"The other reviews speak volumes, but I must stress a point that drove me to distraction through the whole performance...the sound man should be shot! Apparently, during post-production, the fool thought it would be 'nifty' to soup up Sarah's voice a little. I mean A LOT. Flanging, chorusing, the works. It differs from song to song, a few times it's almost gone. Then it returns, crushing her silky crystal voice into a muddy mush. It's something one would do to mask problems with pseudo-singers like Paula Abdul or Madonna. NOT something that should be done to Sarah. Sorry. The annoying sound recording bumps this otherwise stellar video down a couple of stars. I hope the same sound guy isn't working on 'La Luna'...."
4,cost effective,"great mid and high range sound, little or no bass, difficult to mount.......excellent in harsh environment, perfect for boat or UTV."
4,Good product for the price,The speaker pair arrived as promised in new condition and once installed worked perfectly. I upgraded the speaker wire however as the wire supplied was both too short and the gauge was not thick enough.
4,"Not an all purpose film, but has VERY beautiful colors","Kodak Portra 400 VC is very, very punchy! That makes it ideal for autumn colors, landscape, and almost anything with color. This is also a good film for some portraits, when the sunlight isn't too harsh. For studio work, this film is absolutely awful, and I would use something like Portra NC or just Portra. But for everything else, its kinda hard to beat this one."
3,Not Versatile,"This is a very limited versatility 400 speed film better suited to the studio than real life applications. I've found that it is grainy unless used in a very controlled environment. Even good lighting outdoors produces less than satisfactory results. With the right lighting, the film does produce very pleasing skin tones. However, the amount of work that requires is frustrating unless you are a primarily and most comfortably a studio photographer. If you do much shooting outdoors, skip it."
5,Works well!,"Works really well for smaller projects, trim and the like! Also gives a more controlled touch when hammering both trim and small nails."
4,"beautiful, shiny, no smudges, great for contacts","LOVE this mascara. Makes long, shiny lashes. There is no smudging (even in the pool or ocean!), no flaking, and the formula does not bother my very sensitive lashes and skin. I have no problem wearing contacts with it since it stays on the lashes and doesn't flake or smudge off. To remove, I just get it wet and gently press my lashes with my fingers... and it comes right off in little ""tubes."" No pulling or tugging on lashes necessary. This product offers great length but it is not really a volumizing mascara. While it will make individual lashes look plumper, or more substantial, it will not give the illusion of more lashes."
1,HORRIBLE- get a drug store mascara instead!,"This is a horrible mascara- i have better luck with Cover Girl Lash Blast and Maybeline Great Lengths mascaras. This apparently has 'fibers' that help lengthen your lashes- i followed the very precise directions to a T, and all it resulted in was a very watery application that got all over the place. We were 20 minutes late for our date b/c i had to take all of my eye makeup off to reapply all of my makeup! I've NEVER had to do that before. I use both drug store and brands like DIOR and Lancome- this mascara is horrible and definitely NOT worth the $$$$ that you pay for it. Save your money for DIOR SHOW or get a few tubes of Lash Blast...don't waste your money."
4,Phenomenal - but getting it off the eyelashes is another story,"Best mascara I've tried, hands down. I don't know what other reviewers mean by gently washing it off. I can swim and shower with it and it stays on, no smearing, nothing. The only problem I have is getting it off my lashes. I've tried several different eye make-up removers and find that the only way it comes off is by rubbing it off with a remover (not desirable). And for me, gently pulling isn't good for the skin or lashes either.If they sold a remover with it I'd give it 20 stars."
4,"great substitute for Trish McEvoy ... ""lash tubes""","I was sad when Trish stopped selling her ""auburn"" mascara (tube-style), as I am a strawberry blonde, irish girl who looks a little silly with black mascara on. This Medium Brown color from KissMe is a great replacement!The tubes are great! no mess under my eyes, and it comes off easily with water -- no scrubbing, no chemical ""eye-makeup remover"" needed.My only criticism is that the mascara takes on a hard-crunchy feeling to it, and my fiancé says it feels odd. But it looks great!!"
2,Mascara Hype,"There is a lot of hype surrounding this mascara. As a first-time user, here is my break down:Pros:Good staying power (you have to let it dry out well)It does come off just with warm waterCons:It is NOT true medium brownIt provides more length than volumeIMHO, this is an ""ok"" mascara. Not worth the price and hype. I have tried cheaper mascaras that deliver far better results."
1,Blinc Mascara,Terrible product - it flakes off in tiny bits shortly after application and I will never buy it again. Would not recommend it at all.
3,Informational but not practical and little bit egoistical,"Some interesting stories and informations are in this book, but not practical exercises (for this you must take a course). Author uses too many times words ""I"", ""My mom"", ""My dad""Author never read a holy bible, but he made a conclusion like ""If Jesus knew bad times - years, days, months (from Chinese Astrology) he could avoid death on the cross"". The fact is that Jesus intentionaly died on the cross..."
1,VERY CULTIST AND EGOTIST BOOK,"This book is a serious disapointment to the student of Taoism. This author is attempting to make himself a guru, instead of teaching and sharing the ways of the Tao."
2,Definitely NOT the best video. Only shows pics and music.,"This video has some good pictures of Diana, but it is only a bunch of pictures and some music that plays as you watch. Not worth more the big bucks unless this is the only video you need to complete your collection. A&E Biography is a much better choice, or the Legacy of a Princess."
3,"Not the best, buy it if you must have everything out there","It's recorded in EP mode instead of the better SP leading to a visible lack of picture quality. If you own or have seen much of what is available at Amazon or elsewhere you've already seen most of the footage in this tape. The music wasn't too bad except that there was no dialog, just the music, I got tired of seeing the Princess or someone else say something and not being able to listen to them."
4,super duty bed cover,"I had this cover on my wish list for some time as it was the obvious choice for my truck since i already fitted a trac rack system . The only problem was the price which was around 500 $.The current price is more realistic and the cover itself is very well made. However,some of the supplied hardware was missing and i think the instructions need better pics/diagrams."
1,Not for the Shower!,"I have now received, and returned, two of these products. On both units, the clock went haywire after the first day. On the second unit, the fm selection went haywire, sometimes working and sometimes not. The idea of a radio/clock for the shower is a good one, but this product does not deliver. It obviously did not work in my shower as directed. The unit was supposed to be water resistent and made for the shower, but it does not work that way! I could understand if I had gotten a defective unit to start, but when the replacement unit did not work as well, I have to be suspect of this product."
1,Wilson Shower Mirror with Radio,"Do not buy this item. First it is so heavy that when you hang it in the shower the hooks holding it break (this has happened twice). The mirror is not fogless, the radio reception is horrible and the flourescent light goes very dim after about three uses. The company sent me a 2nd radio after a problem with the first and that one was worse than the other."
1,Piece of garbage,"This product is completely worthless. The radio reception is dodgy, at best, slips repeatedly, and is not loud enough to be heard over the sound of the shower. The mirror is not fogless, and, worst of all, TURNED BRIGHT BLUE within the first week of use. No kidding, blue. So, I now have a mirrored shower radio and (1) the radio doesn't work, (2) in the shower, and (3) the mirror is useless. This product is a piece of junk."
1,Piece of junk,"The only component that works is the radio. The clock is broken and resets itself everytime I try to turn the mirror lights on. I tried to hang it, and the plastic screws supporting the lanyard broke. I was even stupid enough to send it out for repairs; I found the screw still broken at the same spot, and the clock still at 12. I dare not use it in the shower to test it's water durability. I only keep it because my husband got it for me."
1,A waste of my money,"I was extremely disappointed with this product. The radio reception is bad, the clock would stop working randomly, and the mirror, not being a fogless mirror, is absolutely pointless in the shower. For what the product turned out to be, I payed too much."
1,Waste of Money,"After a few months of use, both hooks that hold the radio up have snapped off. The tuner slips onto other station, rust has been leaking out of the non-waterproofed container, and eventually it just stopped working altogether. Absolutely a huge waste of money for a product that wouldn't be good out of the shower, but even worse in the shower."
1,Weak and water,"First I found that the radio was only almost water-resistant. Just splashing the mirror a few times managed to short the radio out. The tiny tabs that hold the mounting rope to the back of the radio broke within the first few days. I wrote Wilson and they sent a second set. Those lasted a few more days before breaking off in the middle of the night sending the radio crashing around the tub. The lights are really dim and the radio hard to tune to a clear channel 50,000 watt radio station just fifty miles away."
5,Buy it,Get the album if for no other song than Dolly Parton's 'Travelin' thru'.She wrote it and it is THE BEST!!!!
5,A soundtrack that actually is a soundtrack,"I really liked the Transamerica soundtrack. Like most people, I usually buy a film's soundtrack after having enjoyed the music in the film. In the past, I've bought soundtracks that don't have any songs that actually featured in the movie. The Transamerica soundtrack had many songs from the film, which was pleasing.I've never really been a country/bluegrass/gospel fan, but I think I might give these genres a try because I really enjoyed the music on this CD. I especially liked the song by Duncan Sheik, ""I Am A Pilgrim"", and Dolly Parton's ""Travilin' Thru"". I also liked the fact that a number of David Mansfield's score pieces appeared on the CD.All in all, it was a very good CD, and if you liked the movie, you'll definitely like the soundtrack (even if you've never listened to country in your life)!"
5,Great bag for skiers,This is a high quality bag in which you can fit your boots helmet gloves and more very easily. Boots have separate parts on the sides. With two handles and being a backpack it is very easy to carry it. Material made is high quality. I recommend it to anybody looking for a good boot bag.
5,Wonderfully Thrilling !,"What I loved most about Volume 5 of Tenchi in Tokyo was the in-depth emotion that was portrayed throughout the episodes. It satisfied my wonder of how the situation between Tenchi and Sakuya would turn out, or at least how it seemed to turn out, and kept me on the edge of my seat at the same time. The emotion, action, and peacfully calm moments were nicely balanced out. Also, unlike some of the other Tenchi in Tokyo volumes I viewed, each episode in this volume had something special about it that set it apart from the others and contributed in an important way to the plot of the whole series. I highly recommend A New Love to any Tenchi fan or Anime fan. Enjoy!"
1,Missing bottles,"Be careful because you don't get what is described. I ordered this one because the description said I would get 2 bonus bottles. I did not get the bonus bottles so I contacted Amazon since, at the time, Amazon fulfilled the order. They said they could only refund the money but if I reordered, I should get what was described. I then contacted the company it was sent from, Greencupboards, but they said they couldn't help me as Amazon shipped the item. I returned the sterilizer and reordered. I still didn't get the 2 bottles so I returned it again. Amazon still said that they didn't know what happened. Very disappointed."
1,Not sure why I bought it,"This is an unnecessary bulky item that you won't have room for in your kitchen. We could never return it and it just took up room in the kitchen. We never used it, either. We just put all the bottles in the dishwasher. If we had to sterilize something, we used the Medela sterilizing microwave bags."
4,Clear Audio and Comfortable,"This headset has a good microphone and speaker. It is much better than the Body Glove EarGlove headset that I used previously. The microphone transmits your voice so clearly that the person that you are speaking to often cannot tell that you are on a head set. However, the microphone is adversely affected by wind. It does not come with any foam over the microphone to help mitigate the effect of wind. Other than that, it is a great headset."
4,No ones perfect,"I purchased this radar detector a while back (months and months ago) and its worked flawlessly. It has indeed prevented many a speeding ticket, and its always fun to find out where the police are hiding. This model has a lot going for it; the text display is wonderful, it has three settings (bright, dim and dark...dim is best for night) and a battery saver! Here's what I don't like about it...it doesn't remember your last settings when you turn it on and if you mute it, it stays muted from then on...and will not make a sound again unless you unmute or turn it off/on. I would prefer it if it muted for just that one band and automatically started beeping at the next band it picks up. But no one is perfect, I'm happy with the product...pick one up! Helpful tip: make sure you don't put it behind your windshield wiper -- it obviously won't be able to see anything. Enjoy!"
2,Trouble with X & K bandwidths,"I do a good deal of interstate travelling and I replaced my broken 950 model (broken spring in the selector button) with this one, and I'd rather have the 950. The 1650 I purchased has trouble detecting X & K bands (not sensitive enough), at best it is inconsistent. Otherwise, Ka and Laser works great but the V2 detection/cloaking is also inconsistent (maybe too sensitive) and seems to go off without any reason (no police around for miles)."
1,Title says it all,"Though I enjoyed some of the actors in this film in other films. I think this film is biased towards those who believe in evolution.It makes Christians look like idiots, which they are far from, and trys to hammer into the viewer that Christians or any religion for that matter, must be in the wrong.Even if they wanted to express their views on evolution so passionatly , they could do it without making Christian's look so wrong when they have no real 100 percent proof that Christians are totally wrong. Also I do think if a film was made today discrediting evolution , in such way , overacted way, making all Christains look right, I bet not many people who believe totally in evolution would go and see it. I'd bet my bottom dollar they wouldn't. They would be too offended."
2,please read the original,"Thankfully, due to the internet we may read original source documents concerning important historical events. (...)Mr. Bryan was a hero of the Faith and it is a blessing to read the closing argument he prepared, but was unable to deliver. If only our Christian statesmen and pillars of the community would speak in such open terms with such a glowing love of God and neighbor as he did. We have been beaten down by the godless backlash that followed Scopes, of which this movie is an example, but it is time for a new generation of brave Christians to face the threats which are destroying western nations from the inside out. Please let yourself be transported to the wholesome, healthy, holy, righteous vision of society which William Jennings Bryan represents and presents in the original source. This movie should have portrayed Bryan as a great man on the side of a greater Truth and Darrow as the slimy, worldly-wise man he was."
4,"Excellent film, if a big over-acted","This is an excellent adaption of a great American play, although a bit over-acted, especially by Fredric March. There is absolutely nothing subtle about his performance. I also found Gene Kelly's performance to be quite good. I think his character should be found to be just as annoying as March's, just as self-righteous in his own way. The ending of the movie is one of my favorites... with Drummond slapping the 2 books together as 1 when he walks out. That to me is the most important message of the movie, that science and religion can work together."
4,Great movie,"This (Science vs God) movie held my attention all the way through but what Spencer Tracey movie does not? He is sharp and witted as usual. Good acting even if it feels a bit dated, still love it.This is not so much a movie review but a plea to all Spencer Tracey fans to request that his movies be put in a dvd collection. Just him, I know there are already great Spencer and Katharine collections but this man has some absolutely amazing movies on his own. There are so many of them I am learning, and this one is one of them. Other movies like the Judgment at Nuremberg, Edison the Man, the Old Man and the Sea, and yes Guess Who is Coming to Dinner.I want to see a full collection DVD set and not just of his light hearted films but his great dramas. How about you??"
1,Incredibly Boring at Best,"This movie is terrible. When people make a movie, you assume they would try to make it entertaining at the very Least. Don't waste your time viewing this film. It lasts way too long and you'll be happy when its over. Even if you do like the movie, it has a terrible ending. Hardly any of the conflicts are solved, and you're left with a feeling of disgust. That is only if you manage to make it through the entire movie. The songs in it as well are way too long and sound terrible. To sum it up, this movie is terrible."
2,Show Trial,"Spencer Tracy is always worth watching, but this film is static, didactic and predictable. People who praise it love its agenda, but are tone deaf about what makes a movie a movie. Now, nothing prevents propaganda from achieving artistry. But where an Eisenstein or Riefenstahl can fill a screen with action and drive, Stanley Kramer can only pull off an ideological back-to-school-night that does nothing to change or challenge minds.There's no drama here. The prosecution writes the script. The defendants are buffoons. The verdict is foreordained. The gallery goes home happily reconfirmed in its moral refinement. In short, a Hollywood show trial."
3,disappointing,"fifties style hollywoodizing...artificial crowd scenes...Tracy and others act like they are doing a light comedy. No power anywhere, neither Darwinian nor Moses-ian."
3,Inherit the Wind,"A classic movie - however, the facts are distorted and doesn't reflect the real story. It needs another part - the rest of the story about an ACLU case using a part-time teacher who never taught biology/evolution in the first place. The movie turns out to be a hatchet job on religion."
2,Slanted Without Historical Basis,"Although the acting in this movie is quite good, especially by Spencer Tracey, it is highly controversial. Many people, including myself, are offended by the negative portrayal of creationists. I also found out that the movie, typical with ""The Hollywood Twist"" is far from the reality of what happened in real life. ..."
5,Great Movie,"Spencer Tracy, Fredrick March and his wife are aweseom alone with Dick York and Gene Kelly. This is a wonderful movie."
4,gimme that old time religion,"this was a really cool movie and spencer tracy is awesome (as always); his arguments and speeches were the coolest I've seen in any movie, ever. And it gives you something to think about. I only had one objection to this movie and that is you'll walk out hearing ""give me that old time religion"" in your head for days on end (I say this from experience) and it's really annoying."
2,DVD not compatible. Read the fine print.,I was not aware that this version of the DVD would not work in our DVD. It was not compatible.I am returning the DVD to Amazon.com.
3,excellent musicians!,"Im more of a hard fusion Guy. A teaser track got me to buy this CD. Good, just not quite my style, so only the three stars. Jazz guys should give it a 4 or 5."
4,"Excellent, some very compelling thoughts","I am most interested in Dr. Anderson's discussion of a comprehensive strategy for rebuilding the African American community. Living in a small urban area, Battle Creek, Michigan, it is my belief that we can develop a comprehensive strategy for our community. I would love to have the opportunity to talk with Dr. Anderson about the development of a comprehensive plan."
2,"Good music, bad recordings.","The tracks on this cd are from radio broadcasts and difer a lot from the studio recordings released. Also, there is crowd noise present in the background during the selections. But if you are a die-hard Shaw fan, it might not matter. The band is GOOD!"
3,Very grainy unless lighting is perfect,"This is a very limited versatility 400 speed film better suited to the studio than real life applications. I've found that it is grainy unless used in a very controlled environment. Even good lighting outdoors produces less than satisfactory results. With the right lighting, the film does produce very pleasing skin tones. However, the amount of work that requires is frustrating unless you are a primarily and most comfortably a studio photographer. If you do much shooting outdoors, skip it."
5,A Great Break for entertainment,"The quality of the entire boxed set is excellent. It made the purchase of my Blu-Ray player worth it. I had no problem viewing this region free version. The product arrived in excellent shape & well packaged. I missed this show when it was first aired & started watching the reruns on DirecTV and was totally hooked. I ordered the series when I got tired of only being able to watch 2 episodes a day which is how they were aired. If you can get over the credibility of the initial concept & just suspend belief & go with the flow I think you'll find this was, in my opinion, one of the best series ever on TV. One word of caution when viewing the final episode stop it at the point of ""4 years later"", then watch the ""Final Break"" episode. Then continue viewing the final ""regular"" episode. It will make the end clearer & make more sense."
3,"A fantastic TV show, but this item is not well priced.","Prison Break is/was a great TV show and if you have not seen it, then you should. This is one of the best TV shows to air on TV. Great cast, everyone can act. I will not spoil it in any way by talking about the plot (do they ever get out etc.), i advise you buy it and watch it, the production values are extremely high with Hollywood people like Director/Producer Brett Ratner (Rush Hour / X-Men: The Last Stand).Crystal clear Blu Ray, on a large LED TV it looks impeccable.Sadly though, this box-set, is not well priced.Try this one instead, it is from France, but it is Region Free and it default to English for both Audio and menus.Prison Break Complete Blu-ray Collection incl Final Break-23 Discs [French Import, Region Free]The Show is 5 Stars, the price on this box set is not great so i gave it a 3 star, i would never give it a 1 star, that might scare someone away from great TV/Blu Ray watching.I hope i saved you some hard earned money."
4,Hot stuff,"A graphic tale of a daughter drafted into wanton behavior by her lustful male family members, starts strong, ends on a wimper."
2,Too bad it is fiction,"I just saw this movie & was really enjoying it until I did an google search for ""Jennie"". This movie is fiction according to the relatives of the Churchills and her ""personal"" history. She & Randolph had numerous affairs and wasn't the faithful loving wife portrayed in the movie. She also cheated her sons out of 860 pounds left to them by their father, who she said didn't love them. Not a very nice or sweet ""lady""."
1,Where is it???,It is now 23rd December and this has still not arrived! If or when it arrives I will revise my rating.
3,You've Been Warned,"I absolutely love English period pieces and this one sounded like a gem especially since there isn't much film on Winston Churchill's mother. I couldn't wait for the June 10th release and was able to get a copy reformatted so I could play it in the U.S. Big potential. Remick did win the Bafta award for this role. I wonder what she was up against. You can see she's acting. Not in the same league as Sense and Sensiblity, Duchess of Duke Street, Six Wives of Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Poldark, North and South, Wives and Daughters, Howards End, Emma, etc. Course Remick is no competition for Emma Thompson, Gwyneth Paltrow or Glenda Jackson. And Ronald Pickup as Lord Randolph - at least a half dozen spots you wonder how unreal his behavior was for an educated Lord. Hard to describe the way he portrayed getting his way at times. Do wonder where the glowing reviews come from - distributors? Better to spend your money on one of the ones I listed above. If not you HAVE BEEN WARNED."
5,Well worth the wait.,"I remember seeing this when it first came out...on a tiny black and white portable set. In the typical Masterpiece Theatre way, it was exquisite...almost fairytale in style. I was entranced by Lee Remick...the most beautiful ""princess"" I'd ever seen. A woman with brains as well as beauty, combined with cunning and attitude. It was also a joy to see an American woman navigating the shoals of British politics as if she'd been born to it.I was so upset when it seemed to disappear after the initial showing...wondering if it would ever turn up. I also wondered if it would be as grand as I remembered. It was well worth the wait.One final thing: If any viewers ever get to London, head to the American Embassy. You will see a statue of Sir Winston Churchill on the grounds.I think Sir Winston's mother Jennie would be proud...don't you?"
3,The Rocker Airsofter,"this is a good starting gun. the only problem is the mags,you can't get extras. <THE SCOPE> rip it of the gun and buy a [PELLET RIFLE] scope. normal scope rings don't fit on the rails and those scopes are a lot cheaper then the full 4/9 scopes that fit on the real guns.over all its a great gun."
1,PSG Sniper rifle junk,I guess for a little over 20 dollars what should be expected. barely shoots 20 feet. the magazine quit working in about a day. it would have been more fun for my son to take 2000 pennies and throw them at his target
4,This gun shoots fast,The gun shoots pretty fast. the only thing is the clip. mine came broken because there was a peice of plastic jammed in it. just take out a couple screws and it will work fine. the scope sucks but who cares the gun shoots fast/
2,MOXBIB Redux,"Pointless stories, turgid prose and no sex. It's like talking to Stu himself (without the crumbs).This tome will make a fine addition to your Scrabble library. Otis Steiner."
2,Cheap,Pretty but fell apart. When I took them out of the box one of the Celtic charms fell off. I wouldn't reccomend them.
4,great guide for beginners,"I have worked with many divination tools over the years, mostly tarot. One I didn't have a lot of experience with was runes, which is why I got this guide.As with many books by this publisher, Llewellyn, this book gives a good overview of the subject. There is not a lot of detail here, but enough that you will have a good understanding of the subject to the point where you'll know if you want to pursue it deeper, with other, more advanced materials.I think if you're interested in divination tools, even if not specifically runes, this is a good guide. Even if you never use runes yourself, understanding of their history and how they work is fascinating."
3,Stick with one Naming,The disturbin thing about this book is the fact that the names of the Runes are taken from both the Elder and the Younger Futhark. For the beginning student this can be very confusing.
3,Not bad for the beginner,"This book has a fairly decent (but short) description of the divinatory meanings of the runes, with some brief sections on their magical uses. One thing that bothers me is her inclusion of the blank rune, which is clearly a relatively modern addition which *some* prefer to use, but which most historical purists reject. That said, I still reference it when I want a fairly quick reading, because she does have a decent amount of insight on the modern implications of rune castings - especially when it comes to elaborating on certain runes appearing in combination with others."
1,Confusing and awkward,"I bought this in an attempt to save money, and promptly returned it.I had very little foreknowledge of the runes, but I knew enough to realize how awkward and irrelevant the interpretations are. The author writes in an almost stream-of-consciousness style that, at times, sounds like a TV psychic. In two different sections of the book, the author attributes completely different meanings to a single rune. The literal name of the runes were only explained for half of them, and there was little, if any, actual historical background on the runes. I exchanged this for Paxon's Taking Up the Runes. While still a bit New-Agey, it was definitely better than this. I wish there was a zero star option."
1,Not very useful,"This is not a book I would recommend for those serious about the runes. It is very shallow and not up on its runelore. For those serious about learning the runes, you would be better off purchasing ""Northern Mysteries & Magic"" by Freya Aswynn, ""Runelore"" by Edred Thorsson, or ""The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Runes"" by Sirona Knight."
1,Reality check?,"I don't enjoy trashing anyone's work, but this book is quite simply bad. The rune meanings seem to have been derived from a certain other less than accurate Rune book put out circa 1982. Personal interpretation is one thing, assigning new and unrelated meanings to symbols over 2000 years old is another.For esoteric meaning, try Thorsson, Aswynn, or King, and for historical perspective Ralph W.V. Elliot and R.I. Page are your best bets. Leave this one by the tabloids at the checkout counter."
5,Liked it a lot.,"Great beginners guide to the different runes. I'm giving it as a gift this year with a set of runes to someone who has never had any. I was a bit wary at first about this book but now that I have it and have looked at it, it goes into what each rune means and how different runes are used. Its not a heavy tome about runes but a pocket guide and will make a great start for anyone wishing to learn."
5,A Must read!,Amazing book! Really leads you in the right direction as well as leaving you with a open mind on the use of rune stones.
5,Great for those who understand Magik,"This book is small, yet compact with information for those who understand that magik is within us. Those of you who are on the path to knowledge, well this book is for you.Don't let others deny you of your power, their ignorance will only hinder their selves. Stand strong, this book can and will help those who are naturally attuned to the future, and strong with magik."
2,"Cheap, but is it good value?","This is fairly typical of the inexpensive mass-market New-Age manuals available. It may be a handy booklet on divination, but it has little connection to the historical runes. It could just as well substitute any set of symbols and do the same job.Anyone following the Northern Traditions will be disappointed, perhaps even offended. The author follows Blum's lead in creating a superficial divination system complete with the spurious ""blank rune"". She adds a little influence from other New-Age rune writers, but makes no effort to access the wealth of interesting and powerful historical information that can be found in a university library, or even on the Internet these days. The 3 main rune references she cites are Blum, Fitch, & Conway, need I say more?Some may find the book handy for its techniques, but if you want useful information on runes, you will need to look elsewhere."
1,Perhaps You Get What You Pay For?,"Although Ms. Peschel's book is indeed affordable, the information contained within it's covers may not be entirely accurate or useful beyond a somewhat superficial context. This book does not touch on any of the very important aspects of runic lore that are inextricably connected to the mythos of the Northmen or the creation concepts that are also very much central to the workings of runic energies, both in divination and magick. What's more, it does not endeavor to go beyond the outward manifestations of runic forces, leaving the reader somewhat lacking in understanding of the actual workings of the Wyrd. Also, as a word of caution, using this book as a guide for rune magick could prove to be more harmful than useful as well. Perhaps the book could be useful to a true beginner, although I would be more inclined to recommend Tony Willis' book as a preferable alternative."
3,Practical Guide to the Runes,"This interpretation just didn't do it for me. The interpretations of each rune felt inconsistant, more like a compilation of other people's interpretations. This is not to say that another person wouldn't find just what they need in this book. It just didn't click with me."
2,"A basic book, good for starters, but a little shallow.","This is a small book, both in format, pages and scope. I guess it's a good introduction to runes if one has no idea whatsoever about them, but it focuses too much on divination, which I don't find as important as the archetypes and profound meanings of the runes themselves. It's a 'light' book alright, so it may suit some readers. For serious, scholoarly studies, refer to Edred Thorsson."
3,A good introduction,"I liked this book because it is a simple and inexpensive introduction to the runes. There is a lot of basic information in this book. It also encouraged me to look deeper into the history and the spiritual foundation. The runes have a wild and primitive energy not found in tarot cards for me. Very elemental.The book encouraged me to make a set of runes of my own from the limb of a maple tree that fell during a storm. I didn't make the WYRD rune though. There was something very transformative about making my own runes instead of buying a set.I don't feel that there were enough warnings in the book though, about delving into the unknown of spiritual realms.."
2,it's new age not old traditions,"the blank rune is not a rune; it is a new age invention and has nothing to do with the historical aspect of runes. the definitions are not exactly consistant with meanings given in other books. ideas on usage, for example bindrunes, are very good and even inspiring. :)"
2,You get what you pay for.,"You got to hand it to Peschel, she really wants to write a good book on runes, but this one falls short. Her source material is very bad and although she puts forth a valiant effort to make sense out of all of it, since she is starting from false assumptions, the book is ultimately flawed. The rituals are Wiccan in nature and so are the rune meanings which is not a good place for a beginner to start. On the plus side, she does have a whole section on carving runes and shares some interesting insights on bindrunes which keeps it from being a total loss. In the end it would be better to shell out an extra ten bucks for a better rune book. Remember Egil's Saga: the wrong runes carved on a healing charm made the recipient sicker."
5,Perfect Intro,"Of all the books on the runes, this is by far the best introduction to their use. Other popular books are filled with questionable theory, dubious philosophy and semi-invented religion. This one is so straightforward that it is a pleasure to read, easy to understand and practical to use. No, it is not the final word on the runes. Nor was it intended to be. But if you are interested in a basic introduction to this topic, Peschel's book leads the list."
5,New Dictionary of Theology,"A good reference work, a ton of articles of all kinds (supposed to be over 600)lots of excellent authors/contributors, should help me a lot with vague phrases and definitions. I like the fact that it is a one volume rather complete reference."
2,"Well...I was excited about this book, but now...","I have almost completed the Daisy Mesh Vest pattern, but wanted to forewarn those of you who want this book. I was thrilled to get it initially, as the patterns and photography looked really good. After this project, though, I am seriously not sure if I will try another from this book. I consider myself to be an intermediate/advanced crocheter, and I have to say that the directions for this vest were not clearly written at all. I have been able to figure them out as I go, but I don't like spending that much time frogging and redoing my work. Let me make myself clear-I have NEVER had to work so hard to figure out what the pattern is trying to say. Overall, the pattern is really simple, but the directions make it waaaaaay more complicated than it needs to be.That being said, there are some really gorgeous things in this book, so if you are willing to take some extra time to figure out the directions, you might like it."
2,Not a good book for someone who lives in Europe...Patons yarn not available here,"I have just started the Open-work cardigan (which is the red cardigan on the back book cover). In the instructions the number of stitches is off and thus within my first two rows I found an error and had to start over. WARNING...count the stitches accurately before beginning the patterns. Very frustrating. I also did not realise that this book is written with patterns directly from the yarn company Patons Design, a yarn that I cannot find in Italy. I bought the book on Amazon.co.uk, the English Amazon. I am not very pleased with the patterns themselves as they are on the ""old-school"" style of crochet and not contemporary or unique at all. I do hope to not find any more problems with the instructions as I continue this pattern."
3,Just what the plumber ordered,Just what I expected since I had one already......good delivery though. Just don't like giving my money to such a conglomerate but nobody local had it. SHOP LOCAL!!!
4,Review,"Very nice text for working/restoring a Volkswagen Beetle, and even other air cooled relatives (mechanicals, headliner, door overhaul, and others). It is almost full color, which is a treat. The only problems I have with it is it is a soft cover (can get damaged easier) and some aspects are left to the experts. Oh, and it is in British English, which is not really a problem, and makes the text more interesting. ;-)"
3,OK book,"It is a book with mostly general info, not much of a true restoration book such as what head light was used for this year, good general vw shop book."
4,How to Restore Volkswagen Beetle,My son tells me it is good but he needs to get a more basic book of how you do things before he can gain the full affect from this book.
1,Promotional Item should be Prohibited!,"I was disappointed with the delivery of the CD ""surrender"" by Johnathan Butler because the item was a CD stamped ""FOR PROMOTIONAL USE ONLY"" and therefor should have not been sold. It almost borders on the illegal guidelines of ""unjust enrichment"" Shame on you for your participation in this deceitful tansaction. i hope that I remember never to purchase from you again. Have a good day."
5,Pure Heaven,"Awesome!!!, I love music but this CD touched my soul and I was moved by every song. If you have a true love of music then you will automatically know what I mean when you hear this CD."
5,Simply Wonderful!,"I have followed Jonathan Butler since his entrance into the contemporary smooth jazz field in the early 80s where he was sometimes overshadowed by George Benson because both had similar talents, i.e, extraordinary guitarmanship as well as an equally impressive vocal range However, Jonathan quickly stood on his own merit and has an added dimension because of the South African flavor of his compositions. This newest outing is positively wonderful. It is equally balanced with the same amount of vocal tracks as instrumentals and all are simply exquisite. There are no duds/fillers and the production is top-notch. Unfortunately, I think this album, a recording gem, will be lost in the shuffle due to poor advertising/air play/promotion. But I urge you all to go buy this outing from a premiere jazz instrumentalist/vocalist. You will not be disappointed."
1,Not Water Resistant to 50M,"Product specifications for this watch indicate it is resistant to 50M. I ordered this watch and found that the manual shows that this watch is ONLY water resistant. When I went to return this watch, I found that I would only recieve a refund of $5, less $9 for shipping, making this watch a $4 watch. I gave it to my 4 yr old. It was not worth returning."
1,Wish I could review this product,"Wish I could review the product, but the incompetent people at Direct sent me Prenatal DHA for Pregnant or Nursing Mothers?????? Since I am over 50 I find this funny. Packing Slip indicated the Seabuckthorn Seed Oil-but alas I received the wrong product. If you want the wrong item go ahead and order from this company. Also don't bother trying to call on a weekend as they are closed. So now I have to wait to hear from them, wait to get the correct product and possibly send back the wrong one.Update: 3/10/11-Seabuckthorn Seed Oil capsules-did absolutely nothing for me."
3,I like it,"It takes awhile to really notice any changes, which honestly is expected with natural vs. chemical. I've been taking it at night before bed for about 2 months, and haven't noticed any side effects or serious improvement in my skin or hair but my stomach isn't quite so irritable any more. I'm ordering more now and will update if it is worth the money."
1,I HATE THIS POTTY!!,We bought this potty for my 2 year old and thought it would be a good choice for her. I was so wrong! There are so many peices which is a blast for my 2 year old to take apart that isn't even my problem. The darn thing is a pain to clean if she isn't sitting on it perfectly and pees sometimes it goes into the bottom of the potty which isn't flat has a bunch of little dividers in the bottom. Its hard for her to sit on correctly its tall and she is in the 75 percentile for height. We don't even bother with the blue part that goes around the bottom it just adds more height and we took the lid off because it kept falling and hitting her back when he used the potty. I am sorry we paid the money for this worthless potty go with some thing a little simplier.
2,Stains Easily,"I appreciate the versatility of this potty and the soft cushioned seat. However, the cushioned seat becomes permanently stained the instant it comes in contact with the smallest amount of poo. It is bound to happen, folks. Very poor selection of materials."
1,Worst potty yet,"This is my third son and my third training potty this is the worst potty I have yet. Having three sons we always need the deflector which doesn't stay in place even if you don't touch it, which any little boy will be touching. The bowl sits in an bigger bowl but the sides dont meet and little boys who pee sitting pee into the bigger bowl, which is not easy to get apart to empty, creates a giant mess. Very nice soft seat otherwise a nightmare. Mother of three and all were potty trained early this is not helping this child."
1,Messy & Stinky,I don't have anything good to say about this potty chair. It i so messy and stinky. Somehow when my son pees it gets into every crease and crevice. Pee even gets into the well under the pot as well as outside of the potty too. Even when you clean it after every use it STINKS. The soft foam seat acts as a sponge and soaks up the pee. It still smelss like urine after cleaning it with bleach. While we used this potty my bathroom smelled like a nasty public restroom. My advice would be to by a potty chair with the least amount of seams like the Baby Bjorn products. Beleive me I have tried several different types of potty chairs and rings. 4 in all. So far I like the Baby Bjorn Trainer that goes on the regular toilet the best but if my son was just starting out I would get him the Baby Bjorn stand alone until he was ready to transition to the trainer that goes on the regular toilet. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS POTTY CHAIR. Good luck!
2,too small....,"I bought this potty for my son, and now he is in the process of potty training, I really dont like this seat...It is just way to small, he is average size 2-1/2 years old....I gave 2 stars for the toilet paper, and wipe holder but we never use it.....More recommend fischer-price, froggy potty....."
2,Hard to Clean,This seat is hard to clean and the pee leaks into the bottom and all around the sides. Plus the seat cushion gets cracks in the plastic and pee soaks into the seat cushion itself which as you can guess stinks and is impossible to clean.Its going in the trash unfortunately since there are no replacement seat cushions available.
2,leaks and difficult to clean,"Looks great. Love that it has a soft seat and lid with toilet paper holder (and supposedly the seat can go on a ""big potty"" too?).But shield or no shield, pee sprays or splashes out nearly every time my son uses it, either onto the floor or his underwear, or down into the bottom of the potty/ NOT into the pan like it's supposed to! Just a bad design. And it has so many nooks and crevices it is hard to clean!We have loved this one: ""Safety 1st Comfy Cushy Potty"" No leaks, soft and easy to clean!! http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1St-Comfy-Cushy-Potty/dp/B000LRGQ0A/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid;=1289337929&sr;=8-15"
3,Kids love it but not durable,My kids both loved the soft seat which made it easy to them seated while potty training BUT the plastic cover that surrounds the soft foam has split on the inside seam. When I wash it or wipe it down water gets in where the split is and everything I am trying to wash away gets caught inside the seat cover. Also the blue lid is not attached well and broke off within days of having it after my toddler pushed back on it. The blue removable step stool and small green splash guard is very useful.
4,Good value,"Great product. It may not have the bells and whistles, but those just distract from what the kids are doing, and make it more of a toy in my opinion. It transitions through different stages so you really get your money out of the purchase. Lightweight but sturdy. Comfy for lil bums. Easy to clean."
5,"""bible for genealogy of Isaac Lewton family history","I am a direct descendant of this family and own a copy of this book. Although much documented is yet to be ""verified"", I consider it my family bible. There is so much information, pictures and records of family correspondence from those that are no longer available. Information is compiled up to 1984, and has not been updated, but considering the history that is available in this book that dates back to family originator circa 1700's, it is WAY beyond what any family member could begin to compile for themselves. It has provided me with invaluable notes, family folklore, and with the onset of internet since this book was published, a way to locate information and connect with other descendants with their own information and chapters in the Lewton family history."
2,"Could have been better,","overall this game is nothing like goldeneye and doesn't even score any where close to the quality of perfect dark. I rented this thinking it was going to be another perfect dark but its not. Maybe because it's made by ea and not rare, maybe thats it. But overall if your expecting a game like perfect dark you can pass this one up."
5,"""The name's Bond.James Bond""",TWINE is the best 007 game yet!It even has full speech!(unlike most N64 games)It has great graphics(with the N64 Expansion Pak)and the sounds are very realistic(it sounds like EA recorded the sounds)EA did a great job on this game!
2,In all Honesty,"This game has got great graphics, even better than the previous bond - Goldeneye. (I loved Goldeneye that was a great game) But.....the very detailed graphics have SLOWED DOWN the game. Compaired to goldeneye this game runs VERY SLOW. The controls are also different. The game play in this new bond compaired to the older one (goldeneye) is just terrible.If you have to choose between the new one and goldeneye buy goldeneye. If your looking for an awsome second bond for the nintendo 64 your going to have to wait. Unless you like graphics over game control don't buy this game!"
4,James bond 007 in The World Is Not Cool Enough,This is another good bond game on N64! The Levels are a bit of a challenge but what the hell who doesnt like a good challenge once in a while right? Some of the Levels though are also confusing but fun! I like this game for it's crisp graphics and selection of weapons! There is also a good selection of gadgets!Many Levels to do if yur up for it! Sure you might say this guys dumb we beat goldeneye with over 20 levels! Well this game may not have as many levels as Goldeneye but the levels sure are more of a challenge!Now it comes down to the final review the Multiplayer! Multiplayer on this game is fun also especially with the addition of bots! Now you can play with yur self all you want yeah I said play with yur self! This game is fun fun fun!
3,Not quite like the first one!,"It looked like it was going to be great, like Golden Eye. However, I guess the new designer couldn't quite pull it off. Don't get me wrong, it is still sort-of fun, it is just that the gameplay restrictions, sound, slow loading, and multiplayer game kind of stink in comparison to Golden Eye. All in all I recommend that you rent it first and try it out."
4,Bonds Back!!,"I got this game for christmas this year and i compleated it on agent less than a week later, it is a fun game even though the levels are short, its not as fast as GoldenEye the graphics are just as good with a little more detail. GoldenEyes multi player was the best i have ever played (until i bought Perfect Dark)so i expected this to be good as well but no, the levels are plain and boring and the bots move around like retards. The game follows the movie more than GoldenEye witch is good but buy GoldenEye over this, Perfect Dark is better than both of then."
3,EA vs. Rare,"The first game goldneye is a much better game than the world is not enough. First, the graphics in w i n e are very bad, and that is WITH the expansion pack. Also, when there is a lot of shooting going on at one time, the game runs very slow and I have been killed many times because of this. As well as running slow, their are to many video clips of what is happening to bond, like when he is talking to M and King. Finally, the weapons in goldeneye are much better compared to w i n e. Stick to goldeneye"
4,Great game falls just short,"First of all, I've never played Golden Eye, only Perfect Dark, so that is what I will use as my benchmark.At first I wasn't that impressed. The visuals aren't that great, the weapons are ok but not fantastic, you need a controller pack to save, and some of the objectives were too hard to figure out. After playing a little longer, I've really gotten into the game though, and I know I'll be playing it for a while.Still, it falls short of Perfect Dark. Perfect Dark is a phenomenal game... definately check it out if you haven't played it. Perfect Dark is by the same production group that did Golden Eye, but for some reason they didn't develop The World is not Enough. Oh well..."
3,"good, but not quite perfect","the game is very good. let me get that out of the way first. the graphics are amazing, the guns are way cool, and the multiplayer bots make for a fun game even if you are the only one playing. and the controls are set up so you dont have to pause to change to gadgets. okay, now for some of the bad things, too many controls. with the added jump and crouch buttons you now have to use every button except the L button. if you fail a mission it will either make you start over right there, or just flash MISSION FAILED across the screen making it hard to finish the level for practice anyway. and the only other problem is the lag. i dont know why, but the game takes time to load just like a playstation game. it does that for every level. over all, a good game with a couple of problems that i think RARE would have not done, but EA did a good job making an over all good game."
3,A Little Disappointing,"The World is Not Enough is a wonderful game- as far as the one-player missions are concerned. The second functions of weapons make play a lot more entertaining. The missions are also not too easy, but not too difficult.What really lacks in this game, especially in the wake of Goldeneye, is the multiplayer. The play in versus mode is fast, but it is too easy to kill opponents. The boards for multiplayer are also, in a word, lame.This game is worth buying, but not if you want it for multiplayer. Rent it first."
5,Great Game!,"This is much better than Goldeneye but there's 1 problem. If you are really good and beat each level fast, the game is pretty short, this doesn't have as much levels as Goldeneye. But it's fun to play over & over again!"
4,"Good, but ther is better","First of all, I'm going to keep this short. This game is really good, especially coming from EA, which usually makes sports games. It is better than Goldeneye in graphics and on 1 player, but Goldeneye's multiplayer is much more fun. However, since it is not by Rare, I thought it wouldn't add up. However, I was thoroughly surprised because the 1 player is better than Goldeneye. Better graphics, weapons, etc. But I don't advise you to buy this unless you already own Perfect Dark or played it and think TWINE is better after playing both (NOTE: Play PD with an expansion pack!). Perfect Dark is many times better, especially in multiplayer. However, this game is still really good and I would suggest everyone to play it."
3,I good game that could of been so much better,"TWINE is a good game,but it would be a N64 classic if it had about 5 or 6 more levels, a better multiplayer, and more game options. I beat the game on agent in a about 2 hours, Special agent in about 2 and a half, and 007 agent in 3 and a half. Paying ... for a game and only have 6 hours of gameplay is not right."
3,the world is not enough,"If I had known this game did not have a memory, I would never have bought it. I E-mailed Electronic Arts, & they could care less. I will never buy another EA product again. This game is NOT even close to the game ""Goldeneye"" is."
3,007: Not Golden Eye,"A mildly entertaining, albeit, mindless distraction worth only a fraction of the cost it was sold for when new. Hero/sociopath bond blasts his way through ten minute long levels full of euro-terrorists and slightly above playstation level graphics (game originally on playstation), complete with 70s car chase music to remind you that this game merely exists to complement a movie and not to provide a compelling or unique experience. Still, if you can get it for really cheep (under $5.00), you really like the 007 franchise, and you have a gun fetish (there are a lot of guns!), I'd recommend this title."
2,Very bad Bond sequel... no where CLOSE as good as CORE's,"After Playing CORE's version of Bond this game sours in comparison. The controller is no where even close to use as a 1st person shooter. The graphics are sharp but stale looking. The two-player environments are WAYYY too small and confined. Save your money and go CORE: GOLDEN EYE, PERFECT DARK or wait for the PERFECT DARK sequel."
2,Wow... A Disappointment...,"The World is Not Enough came out just as I completed Goldeneye. Now, I thought that the sequel would be AWESOME, considering that Goldeneye is a terrific game. However, I was disappointed when I got TWINE. The graphics and the dialogue are cool, and the gadgets are terrific, but the levels are way too easy. Your enemies die in a couple of shots. Also, in Multiplayer, you don't have much health. Two shots, you're dead. Another terrible thing about TWINE is that it takes time to load, which is strange, considering that it is a cartidge for the N64. At first, I thought that EA Games was trying to take my money, because in order to save games, you had to have a Controller Pak. Borrow this game first, to see if you like it. Then buy it."
2,EA screwed this up,"If only Rare made this game, maybe it would of been better. I can't even compare this game to Goldeneye or Perfect Dark. Here are the reasons why I don't like this game:1. When you start a level, you have to wait 5-10 seconds for a level to load, which is really annoying.2. You have to use a controller pack, so without that, the game is worthless (I think EA really wants your money)3. The game doesn't even have half of the levels Goldeneye or PD has!4. You don't have ANY enegry and you get killed quick5. You can't blow up anything like you can in GoldeneyeSo compared to Goldeneye, Id skip this game."
4,Pretty neat game BUT....,"Mainly it's a super neat game that's got slightly better graphics and voice recognition than Perfect Dark.BUT,I've had this game for 3 days and I'm on level 6:Night Watch.It is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT!!You can't kill a single person(if you run out of your lousy 12 darts,stun someone with your watch laser then punch someone twice-twice because they fall down and dissapear!)whitch I think is extremely lousy!Also,Electra's head bodygaurd,Gabor,walks around in a light brown dress coat and if he wants to even walk around that O-so-certian-corner that you,James Bond,may be standing at the GABOR dude sends about 5 gaurds to lock you back up in your state room.I also think Multiplayer mode could have some better stuff like better slections of guns and stuff like that.Overall, If it was a life or death situation I would suggest this wwwwwaaaaayyyyy over Perfect Dark."
2,What a disaster,"I bought the game, and I was pretty dissapointed, the graphics are better than Goldeneyes but graphics arent everything, the game lacks in many departments, such as the enemies AI, they are pretty dumb, and a few levels start to [tick] you off because you keep getting spotted and have to wait for this long cinimatic to roll through. The multiplayer is horrible and the game just doesnt have what it to takes to be called a second goldeneye"
5,"hard, but easy","I thought this was a great game. I rented it over a weekend and I beat it two days. Of cource I was playing all day! Some levels were hard, but some levels were easy. It was nice after beating a hard level to do an easy level. I think the programers did a great job with the graphics because they were so detailed. I didn't mind the three second wait while the game was loading. Overall this was by far the ""Best Bond!"""
2,A Nice and Slow all around Sloppy Game,TWINE's graphics are nice but the gameplay is really bad the controls are a little screwy and if you want a really good shooter for N64 I think you should consider Perfect Dark that game is the best game for N64 out and has been ever since it came out.
1,Disappointing,"You would expect a sequel to outshine the original. This is not the case with TWINE, which is unfit to pick up Goldeneye's spent shell casings. The graphics and game play are a step backward in this otherwise compelling 007 series."
1,You Dare to Compare this to GoldenEye!,"How can anyone compare this game to GoldenEye. My brother bought this game and returned it after 3 days. If you are looking for a better game than GoldenEye, get Perfect Dark. I wouldn't play this game if it were a gift to me. It's horrible."
3,Squirrel Nut Zipper,"Good candy, Just like i remember as a kid. They need to be ordered in the cooler months or they would get sticky."
1,stay away from this thing!,"The worst pos I ever listened to. It sounds like it's coming out of a cardboard tube, and it skips if you look at it the wrong way. Save your effort for something that works."
3,Childhood memory,"this was one of my favorite movies when I was a teen. But after reading the book and seeing all the non hollywood versions, it,s really not the best.tim dalton is in the best"
5,Hauntingly Beautiful!,"This video was the first black and white movie I had ever seen (with the exception of Lon Chaney's ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" and Mexican Cinema star Cantinflas). After watching this movie I became a weird teenager who was all into black and white movies.Yes!!! I know this version doesn't exactly follow Bronte's novel, but it is still a spectacular film with a plain but pretty Joan Fontaine and an intimidating tall dark and handsome Orson Welles. Who can do it better than good old Orson?!!! The whole plot makes the story perfect for the effects of black and white film. I've seen all other versions and I must say that none of them come even close to this one, in my opinion.Tip: I you are loyal to Bronte's novel to the death and wish to compare book with film, you might be disappointed. If you wish to see this film and are a fan of black and white film and period pieces, you will definitely enjoy this film. Heads up for the DVD release April 24th, '07!!! It's about time!"
5,Jane Eyre,"I have this original version of Jane Eyre with Orson Welles. I fell in love with it as a young girl watching it on TV. It is truly wonderful. I also have the version with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsburg. Hauntingly beautiful. I recently purchased the newest Jane Eyre from Masterpiece Theater. This is an updated version with just the most subtle hint of spice, also wonderful. Anyone who loves the Jane Eyre story should treat themselves to all three versions. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Spell Binding,"This is the most engaging movie I've ever seen. I was a fan of the book and this is the only film adaptation to, in my opinion, do the book justice. Every time this movie is shown on television I tune in, no matter what the time. It's worth losing sleep for. You will be captured by its mystery, its ever present sense of longing as Jane Eyre strives to find her place in the world. She searches for a place where she can find love and a home. Watch this movie and you'll find love and a home for it in your video library."
3,Stresses the Gothic elements,"My first impression- it was very gothic. Quite dark and ominous with eerie music adding to the look and feel. This was quite a stark contrast to the 1934 version, that's for sure! It was much more faithful to the novel than 1934, but it still changed quite a bit as well.I found Joan Fontaine to be slightly too subdued in her performance as Jane. I know Jane is suppose to be reserved, but I think it was taken too far- almost to her having no emotions at all. Orson Welles as Rochester's performance stressed Rochester's dark and troubled side- completely ignoring the character's sense of humor. Once again, stressing the Gothic elements.Look out for a very young Elizabeth Taylor in an uncredited role as Helen Burns! This version was certainly more faithful than 1934 and much better made on the whole, yet I'm afraid I don't share the love a lot of people seem to have for it. It still changed a bit too much for me and was at times overly dark."
3,Not Our Jane,"This film is visually stunning but is unfaithful to the book. In fact, they use text for narration but the text is not from Charlotte Bronte's immortal classic; it is the not-so-great stuff of the screenwriters. The young Jane is amazing but Joan Fontaine as the grownup Jane is all wrong. She's too pliant, not totally true to herself like our real Jane. Perhaps that's not Miss. Fontaine's fault, but the screenwriter's, given she's a luminous actress. If you really love the novel, which is to really love Jane, the 2011 film is the very best version."
5,WonderfulWV,"I received this DVD in a timely manner. As promised, it was new; still wrapped in factory cellophane. I would definitely purchase again from this supplier."
3,"Orson Welles is excellent, but the plot veers from the book!","I watched this early one Sunday morning. Orson's Rochester is quite good, but I cannot say the same for the rest of it. Sequences in the book were blown way off the map - when Jane leaves Thornfield, she DOESN'T go to Gateshead, like this version shows she does! Jane's hairstyle looks frightfully strange, although she is a well-acted character. For my money, there are better versions of Jane Eyre, such as the one with Timothy Dalton. It's a longer version, but it follows the book much better!"
3,Could Be Better,"Jane Eyre was such a wonderfully written book that anyone following the plot could have made it wonderful. I think that thoguh this version was better than the 1996 version, it could have been better. The special effects were cheap and unrealistic. However, the actors did very well in portraying emotions and showing their feelings. I wish that it could have been longer and followed the book a little more precisely."
2,A Complete Re-Write of the Story,"I bought this because of a mistaken belief that at least Orson Wells would have been respectful of Charlotte Bronte's work. I was wrong. The original story was completely re-worked beyond recognition. Frankly, I don't see what the makers of the movie gained. It is obvious that a great deal of money was spent making the movie. Why not do it right instead of turning out this poor cribbled thing?"
2,Don't Bother,The other reviews tell about missing parts but I hadn't read about the over-acting and dramatic interpretation of the great book. I understand the era in which this movie was produced but it did no justice to the book at all.I was disappointed but I am old enough to know better and I should have seen this coming.
2,"An Uneven, Flawed Attempt","I had never seen this ""Jane Eyre"" in its entirety until I recently bought this DVD. I remember flashes of brilliance and that's what I saw when I finally sat down and watched it. The casting is ridiculous: Joan Fontaine being too old and Orson Welles acting way over the top. Robert Stevenson was certainly not at fault and I'm sure he couldn't control Welles, who kept wanting co-directing and/or co-producing credit and David O. Selznick trying to control the whole thing when he had sold the property casting and all to MGM.The design and lighting are marvelous and the first part of the film about young Jane is incredibly compelling. But Joan Fontaine is just too sophisticated for the role.I have just ordered the British version starring Timothy Dalton and hope it is better."
1,"overly dramatic, untrue to the book","Not only does this movie not adhere to the book in the least, leaving out such details as Jane's cousins, it also makes her determination to leave Rochester after learning of his wife seem paltry. An over-use of mist (every three scenes or so) where the mist-machines are all too visible, and thunderstorms every other scene add to the lack of realism. Rochester's crazy wife is only seen once, for about 2 seconds, where she jumps out at Rochester and tries to (as it seems) bite his neck. The characters are one-dimensional. The fact that the entire movie is dark, gloomy and gothic makes is almost funny, especially once you've seen (for the third time) Rochester, wearing a long black cape, leave his dark gloomy castle with a scowl on his face, mount his black horse and ride off with a yell into the darkness with mist swirling in his wake."
3,Janet!,"We think this version is quite good, but could be improved, because they missed out, or reararanged the order of important scenes!Despite this the acting quality was good, although Orson Wells is almost too ugly to look at! Also Joan Fontaine is WAY too pretty for the role of Jane!!!It has some good points, such as, NO ONE SPOKE IN FRENCH ACCENTS, (not even Adele!!)We have seen 3 versions of Jane Eyre, in our veiws this is the 2nd best!!We advise you not to watch this version first! Because it strays from the plot!!Make more please!!!!!!!!Jane Eyre Police!!!"
1,a disappointment,"The only good think about this is the story- the actors are horrible. I expected more from both, specially Orson Wells. It is black and white or the technical quality,( although the sound was bad- I had to turn my volume to 70 to hear it passably)- but those were not the only reasons I did not like it. Jane Eyre was supposed to be 18, not thirty and Joanne Fontaine could never act, Orson Wells was always glowering and abrupt."
3,Good Bad Film,"This is not a movie for you if you are looking for Masterpiece theatre.If, however, you enjoy the Mystery Theatre 3000 kind of film, strap yourself in for this one. It is so ludicrous and utterly preposterous that it is entertaining in its own badness. Where else can you see Pat Morita portray an illustrious herpetologist who hunts 30 foot poisonous snakes with nothing more than a stick? Let me just say this...wait for the drop-kick. You'll be rolling on the floor"
2,Skip this one!!,"King Cobra tries to be a monster/ horror movie but it just doesn't work. The special effects and the story are weak and the snake looks ridiculous. Combine this with below par acting and you have one bad movie. If you must see this, rent it, but I must advise you to save your money, this one is not worth buying."
3,King Cobra,King Cobra is about a mutated snake named Seth. He is mixed between a rattle snake and a cobra.When a lab explodes Seth is unleashed in a small town and starts to kill who ever is found in his path. The town soon finds out if they don't stop this snake they will all be dead. The special effects were very well done. The acting is good too. The plot could have been changed a little more to make it more exciting. Still it is a fun movie to watch every once and a while. The dvd is exellent. The dvd has an 8 minute making of king cobra. A great trailer and a production commentary by David and Scott Hillenbrand. King cobra is a great movie to add to your collection of snake movies. Recommended!
1,no star.,Stupid movie...very cheap price movie...very bad characters... very bad scripts....This movie will entertain only for kids around 1-10 years. That all I can say...
1,Yikes!,The previous review must have been written by the producers. It's as obvious as the screenplay. Shame!
3,COILED TO STRIKE,"KING COBRA is another giant snake movie; this time around it's a genetically enhanced cobra and rattlesnake that wreaks havoc. Pat Morita ""stars"" as a herpetologist who is recruited to destroy this giant snake named Seth, which escaped from its laboratory when a shot up techy decided to try something new and blew the lab up. Character actor Joseph Ruskin plays the scientist who managed the project, and lost an eye in the fire. The snake is on the loose during a beer making festival (that's original), and it chomps on a few locals before being unceremoniously killed in the end. Director Hellenbrand stages some nice scary moments early in the film, but he never shows us the full snake (budget probably didn't allow), but the close-ups are pretty effective.Not a bad snake movie, but not a classic either!"
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY !,Ok lets get to the point. This is clearly a rip off of anaconda wich wouldnt be so bad if had been pulled off well.i realy wasnt expecting a great movie here but i at least thought it would be watchable....to bad it wasnt the script was weak (a giant snake being caught in a big plastic tube get real)the acting was terrible( oh no! its a big snake)...get the idea the effects were really bad the whole thing was done with a cheaply made animitronic snake that looked like the rubber ones you had when you were a kid the snake attacts consisted of this snake standing eye levle with people makeing single strikes at them it looked like a big hand puppet.i knew it wouldnt be great but this was horrible if you want a decent snake movie get anaconda
3,Intertesting reading tracking the journey of Martha's climb.,"Marthat Stewart in herself is an interesting woman. She must have strong leadership to get where she is at. And honestly I was hoping to read more about her leadership capabilities, how she organizes her days in some depth and some of the obstacles she had to arise from. I did learn about her upbringing, all her successful steps and how she buys this and decorates and entertains that. It was good reading, but I was hungry for more and did not feel the price tag was worth it."
3,Study tool,"I purchased this for the members of my Bible Study because they enjoy having a format to ""take notes"" as they read ahead for the next week. The questons call their attention to important details in the readings. I am using the study as one of six sources that I pull together for the weekly sessions."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"THIS THING SUCKS! NO, WAIT, THAT IS AN INSULT TO THINGS THAT SUCK! IT IS OFF THE CHARTS! IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH MENTIONING ITS NAME! It is about the same size as the original controler and has a turbo button feature and a programable freature and your thinking ""hey this could really be useful."" WRONG! THE A, B, X, Y, Black, and White buttons are virtually unresponsive unless you press REALLY HARD. Also the thumbsticks are too sensitive. GET SOME OTHER CONTROLER!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!"
2,What's the use?,"Mixed bag, this.This controller is the same size as the original X-Box conrtroller, which is a bit big. For me, that's a down-side, but some users prefer the bigger size to the S-Controller.Another unique function is that is is programmable, which is good for fighting games, but... what else?For me, this controller was a wasted purchase, so it stays in the pouch it came with (which is quite a nice perk, actually)."
2,Not as pictured not a duke clone,this controller is not what you see in the picture. You think you are buying a large controller similar to the original x-box controller (the duke) but what you get is the compact version. The buttons are not sensitive enough because it is cheaply made. If you're using this to play a fast paced game you'll get killed every time. if you don't mind a small controller go with a pelican brand. Its just as good as microsoft's but at a fraction of the price.This controller is not that comfortable to hold either the only good thing about it is the price everything else is lousy.
2,Very mediocre,This kit has several problems. The arms keep falling off. It's unable to keep the shield on tightly. The weapons don't stay on securely. Keeping the gun in it's hand is a shore. Many may be put off by the scale of the F91 it being one of the samller mobile suits in the Universal Century timeline. It looks puny next to my other mobile suits like the Zeta or Nu Gundam. It's an ok kit. If you want a good version of the F91 get the robot spirits version instead.
4,very nice set.... will be very versatile,"The pieces are all beautiful. The silvery ""swirls"" are basically a muted gray and the black looks like it's been softened....it's not glossy like the piture appears. They're still beautiful. My fave pieces?The mugs are stinkin' awesome. I also love that you get 5 pieces for each of 4 people. Most sets only offer 4 per person.This will look great with the turquoise of this season, the red of next and the pink of the future. Just buy some tall smoked glasses and you're good to go."
5,Great Book!,"Well written, honest and easy to read - this is the kind of book that gets dusted off every year or so and re-read."
4,Hellcat History,"A smashing history of the F6F and the author, from its introduction to the fleet til shortly before the end of World War 2. I would be happy to recommend this book to any of my aviation friends and particularly those who have had the pleasure of flying this magnificent machine."
4,A pilot's story,"This is another in the genre of fighter pilot's biographies, much like Robert Johnson's ""Thunderbolt"". Like the others it gives some background and then concentrates on their war experiences. Like many of them, I found it engrossing and full of information on the aircraft and what it was like to fly them in combat.In this case the aircraft is the Grumman F6F Hellcat carrier fighter and the combat was the carrier war in the Pacific. The author had flown other planes, such as the F4F Wildcat, in other theaters, such as North Africa, but the focus is on the Hellcat against the Japanese. The author became the US Navy's first Hellcat ace of the war."
3,Entertaining yet misleading...,"The movie was very good. It was entertaining..err for the most part (there were a few dull moments). The characters seemed realistic, though the main character was too goody goody and nice. As for the story, it had somed great parts in it but was on average just good. One thing was that I was expecting a scifi-ish movie. This was sorta more of a melodrama that made comments about human nature. The story was somewhat fast near the end but the ending was totally disapointing!! They don't tell you anything what so ever. Don't get me wrong. I don't want everything explained to me..in fact i hate it sometimes, but this was just..lame. Personally, it was a good movie that got undeserved raves. END"
5,This is as good as it has every been,As someone who has spent their working years designing earth stations like you see in this film I was so impressed that the technical detail was so good. Small technical errors are forgiven in a great film overall. This film played out a scenario I have pondered over many times. Late at night in a earth staions during performance tests I have kicked the antenna off it test axis and looked around at the many carriers out there.... Jodie Foster played that role so well and I enjoyed every moment of a thinking persons film..a rare output from any studio. END
4,"True to Dr. Sagans optimistic hopes for someday discovering we have ""neighbors""","Well written and consistent with Dr. Sagan's espoused views in his other works. The movie that it inspired was similar but, of course, much more superficial as movies are wont to be.I would highly recommend this as an intriguing look at some of the issues and implications that would surely arise should we someday find ourselves faced with proof that we are not alone in this vast cosmos."
4,Deeper than most si-fis,"On the surface it is just another sci-fi about the possible existence of extraterrestrial life, but on a deeper level it raises a lot of interesting questions. Can an experience that a persons has prove the existence of something even if nobody else shares that experience? This movie, ironically, in contrast to Carl Sagan, seems to make an argument for the existence of God, in that some people seem to have experiences of God that are as real to them as this contact was."
5,eye opening film,i think that this film is a perfect example of the biggest question of the world. is there life out there? this movie portrays a realistic example of how the world would react to the discovery of intelligent life in space. this film is perfect if you want to feel absolute awe and emotion.
5,Astronomical,I loved this movie...this movie has inspired me to become an astronaut...I'm no longer afraid to have my own thoughts and beliefs no matter how much people say that I'm totally crazy...
4,Nice Movie,"The first part of the movie is pretty slow, but it escalates in a frenzy of action later on. The sound and picture quality is superb. I reccommend this movie to anyone who like sci-fi type movies. Life is out there."
4,A good movie becomes A GREAT DVD,"In some ways, this adaptation of Carl Sagen's novel does not work. There is very little chemistry between Foster and McConaughey (a relationship totally changed from the book), and the ending could have been better scripted.But I like this movie in spite of its shortcomings. It is a rare combination of an interesting plot line and great special effects. Jodie Foster gives a good performance.But if you're on the fence about buying this DVD, consider that it has great commentary tracks (by Foster, Zemekis, et all) and some fascinating behind the scenes explanations of how the special effects were constructed. One of the best packaged DVDs for the money.As a movie, this is good, not exceptional. As a DVD, it is a worthy addition to your collection."
3,Something disappointed!,"I was something disappointed with the movie by several reasons: It was given too much to the show... to substitute the message hidden in the infinite of the ciphers of the Pi by the idea of the plans for construction of a machine that allowed a space trip, it was at poor least; There is the attempt of reducing the contact to the encounter and it proves of the existence of God, which is anecdotic; It is full of clichés ""everything is inside of us, since we believe ""; This film is, for me, far away from reaching the statute of film of the year that many tried to attribute!"
5,CONTACT {BLU-RAY},"This is a really good movie I think. Jodie Foster did a great job. She's smart, & one of the best actors of our time. I am glad they shot this in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio so you can enjoy the whole movie as it was meant to be seen. The video is absolutely beautiful. One of the better Blu-rays I've seen. I can't comment on the audio too much as I listen on external speakers hooked up to my stereo. It sounds good in regular stereo anyway. There are some nice extras too. I say if you like this movie & are thinking of buying it in Blu-Ray, go ahead. You won't be disappointed."
3,Half decent.,"Havent read the book yet although i have it. At the beginning of the movie i enjoyed some of the dialogue concerning M objects and other jargon we amateur astronomers and professional cosmologists use. But, and this is a spoiler, when she finally gets to go on her journey and she finds her dead father its pure bs. Typical hollywood stuff no matter the science behind it. Ill keep it on the shelf but doubt ill watch it again anytime soon."
4,wow,"I don't need to say much since most of the reviewers here are right on with their opinions of Contact, but I have to say: the scene where the radical religious terrorist destroys the first launch site literally had my mouth hanging open...I'm not easily shocked my movies, but the special effects combined with the cinematography of that sequence had me in complete shock...a truly awe-inspiring film."
5,Excellent,"I'm a believer in extra-terrestrial life for the exact reason this film's characters believe in them: if we were alone, it would be a pretty large chunk of wasted space. ALIENS EXIST! this film does a masterful job at how people would react to this message received back. and there is a powerful message about faith and science being able to work together, though that message may seem a bit heavy-handed.On a side note, i doubt we'd ever come into contact with aliens, and not for the lack of trying, but just because the distance is far too great. i would love it if we were to contact other beings, but it wont happen just yet."
3,"Excellent movie, poor dvd edition","This is an excellent story. Jodie Foster is compelling as the child that never stopped believing in her dreams, in spite of everything. Oscar-worthy performance by her and her costar (Matthew M.)Very watchable movie that can handle multiple viewings.However, this dvd edition's ""extras"" come up VERY short. Audio commentaries sound canned & non-interactive. They would have been better off adding alternate language tracks.There is NO theatrical trailer on this edition, which is a shame because Contact had a very good one.Buy this dvd because you like the movie (which is good), but dont expect to be thrilled with so-called collector's edition bonuses. I'd rather buy a ""no-frills"" dvd than buy this one expecting something extra."
3,Good but flawed,"This is NEARLY a superb film. An extra-terrestrial communication is picked up and (eventually) Jodie Foster goes on a very surreal space trip while apparently not moving. Foster is excellent throughout, but the film is spoilt by a crass sub-plot concerning so-called religious right politicians who try to prevent her going on the misson because she doesn't believe in God. The over-coiffured Matthew McConaughey looks far too well groomed for a priest, and is unconvincing in his role.There are some great moments though, and some excellent special effects, so there's enough here to interest the average sc-fi fan."
5,Great Turnaround time,"Thanks so much for the quick turnaround time with my order. I was really pleased on how well the item was packaged and even more pleased with how fast I received this item. I've always liked this movie and had it in VHS form but wanted it on DVD, unfortunately I had been unable to locate it in our local stores. I took a chance and found here, again thanks so much for getting the movie to me as quickly as you did."
2,The Worst of the Best,"Robert Zemeckis' worst film. Jodie Foster's worst performance. Given the potential of the crew, this is one of the worst movies of the 1990's. It's nearly as bad as Twister and bad for the same reasons: lazy direction with 2 minutes of visuals serving as compensation. A real low point in the career of some brilliant artists."
4,the sum is greater than the parts,"I really disliked this movie the first time i saw it. My biggest dislike was for Matthew McConaughey charachter which I thought was way overdone. After viewing it again i still have problems with McConaugheys simpistic and intrusive portrayal of a ""modern man of faith"" but focused more on his messages which represent genuine skepticism but eventual reconciliation between science and religion. Jodie Foster is awesome as usual - its terrific seeing her in a Sci-Fi movie and I hope she does more of this in the future. The DVD Video and Sound is very good and adds a lot to the ambience and impact of the film."
5,"Smart, emotional, brilliant!","You'd have to be into that whole ""thinking"" thing to appreciate this movie. I was a little disappointed with the ending the first time I saw it, but after seeing it a few more times, it all began to snap together. This is NOT a cheap sci-fi B-movie that you can just half-watch and then go on with your life. It's one of those that you are thinking about long after, and it slowly begins to fit together.I didn't think that this movie was offensive. In fact, I felt somewhat spiritually empowered by it. One of the big messages in the movie is that faith is something that cannot be explained or proven, not even by science."
2,"Jodie Foster, Meet Larry Summers","In Contact, Jodie Foster plays Ellie Arroway, abriiliant astronomer, maybe the smartest woman in thewhole world. Mathematics and science are every bit asnatural to Ellie as knitting a scarf or whipping up asouffle. Ellie's on a one-woman mission tofind intelligent life somewhere out in the cosmos. Itsure ain't in this movie. Here's how she quantifiesher excitement:""You know, there are four hundred billion stars outthere, just in our galaxy alone. If only one out of amillion of those had planets, and just one of out of amillion of those had life, and just one out of amillion of those had intelligent life; there would beliterally millions of civilizations out there.""OK, here's what I get: ""one out of a million"" of fourhundred billion leaves you with 400,000. So before youeven get to the second ""one out of a million"" you areout of millions to get one out of. This is not evenclose, and would probably get you a summer in remedialmath at even a crappy public high school."
1,Is this what passes for popular entertainment?,"This movie symbolizes everything that's bad about pop sci-fi. A deep, meaningful movie that made no real sense, had a plot that DRAGGED, and was filled with countless scientific blunders, unfounded assumptions (evidently you have to be an atheist to be a scientist), and ultimately left the viewer asking the inevitable question ""What the hell was that all about?"". If you truly like science fiction avoid this movie at all costs."
1,Intellectual Dishonesty at its Best.,"This film is filled with absurd factual and scientific inaccuracies that are an insult to any remotely educated individual. Even an introductory course in Physics will allow for the dismissal of a large variety of claims made here. Worst of all is the presentation of fiction as fact, which discredits all fields of science and aids in spreading ignorance. Clearly this movie is meant to be a tool for religious doctrine.Contrary to the movie's disturbing claims, the percentage of people who believe in a spiritual being is NOT 95%."
1,One Lame Movie,"The theme of this ~~film~~ is the foolish assumption that superior intelligence will confirm the ignorant and arrogant belief that GOD does not exist. While state of the art science clearly proves the impossibility of evolution, atheists desperately cling to the Darwinian fallacy. Ironically, if there was a personal contact with ``benign aliens`` who confirmed Divine Creation, the evolutionist would probably still attempt to justify his own misguided position. While there are ``billions and billions`` of stars in the universe, this failed film gets 1."
1,How can so many people have given this movie 5 stars!,"This movie was terrible. It had a lot of potential, and in the end was just one BIG let down.The first device gets blown up... but wait... we built a second one so its okay. Then the f'ing alien looks like her father! get out of here! The film starts off good (I'll give them credit there,) then it just goes to heck about the time the first device gets blown up.It's like the writers had all their creative juices flowing, then half way through the story they decided to smoke crack and then finish."
3,"Nice movie, but it misses the deeper message of the novel","I enjoyed this movie and would have given it a higher recommendation had I felt that it followed Sagan's story more accurately. In typical Hollywood-liberal fashion, it misses the point by painting Religion as the villain. Sagan, in contrast, successfully merged religion and science in a gray tone, rather than the cliche-ic black and white that Hollywood prefers. Without giving away the book's ending (if you liked this picture, you should DEFINATELY read the novel), let me just say that his brilliant and incredibly thought provoking ending was completely ignored. Big mistake. However, Jodie Foster's performance still saves this version."
5,My favorite movie,"My favorite movie - please note that this movie is written by Carl Sagan and appears to be about aliens and outer space. Nope. Get that concept out of your brain. The movie is about HUMANS, and how our society will react to news of aliens or other civilizations.How does humanity deal with all the potential issues this causes with religion and other beliefs? Watch the film to find out! It's great!"
5,love this movie,"I love this movie and just had to own it. while the ending (last 30 mins or so), are a little hard to understand (they really dont get their point across well), its a great movie."
3,A little dissapointed,"The movie was good. I love Jodie Foster, but the ending was a let down for me. Was expecting a lot more."
5,WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!,"Contack is the 90's version of 2001. It is a work of art! Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump, Back to the Future I, II and III,) has done it again. Sagon would have loved to have seen this film. It questions faith, the world and everything. Jodie Foster was a complete knock out. She is quite simply the best actor alive. William Fichtner, also impressed the hell out of me. James Woods, the evil Mr Kitz was a perfect portayel of a sleezy government man. WHAT A FILM!!!!!!! END"
5,Wow!,"This movie is totally outstanding. Finally, a movie that makes some sort of sense when science is involved. Unlike, armageddon which made me sick becuase it was totally unbelieveable."
1,terrible,"it was long, unengaging and frankly, the end was not creative in the slightest. Don't know what else to tell you."
1,Unspeakably terrible movie,"I am shocked and disgusted that this movie has received such a high rating. Hands down, this is the worst movie that I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through."
1,This movie is terrible,"She rides through space and time to <spoiler alert> meet her father on some tropical beach. Of course it's not literal, but that doesn't give it the right to be crap."
1,Dont Waste Your time,"The ending to this movie really makes you feel that you wasted a few hours of your life. I cant even think of a worse ending that they possibly couldve done, its like the writers tried to make up the worst ending imaginable"
5,Watching it again so many years later... what a ride!,"I really enjoyedContact, written by Carl Sagan. So I remember, years ago, of having high expectations for the movie version. I was ready for an outstanding performance by Jodie Foster, but Matthew McConaughey was very well suited for his role as well.The ending, as you probably know, is different between the movie and book versions. And in the book, there are more than one travelers allowed to go into ""the Machine.""I started watching Contact again as I was running on a treadmill, and I was surprised that it held my attention so well that the miles just melted away (a 7 mile run). And I recently watched a NOVA segment on ""mirror neurons."" The acting of Jodie Foster and the girl who played her as a young girl, using my mirror neurons, had me ""living the experiences"" with her.Great, great film."
4,The ending doesn't bother me at all,I don't know why it bothers others. Jodie Foster is wonderful as her character is given the gift of faith at the end.
4,Excellent movie.,"Contact is one of those movies you have to buy. The plot and story are very deep and something everyone can relate to. Religion vs. Science, Space, Love all major parts of this movie. The special effects are terrific! All star cast including former President Bill Clinton, Jodie Foster and others. Watch it and then buy it..."
2,Great premise destroyed by Hollywood touch.,"This movie is another example of how truly good sci-fi ideas are mutilated by the hollywood feel-good pandering ending. A good premise, which I would expect from Carl Sagan, and does bring up a good issue debating the meaning of religion in a realm of science. But then it goes way overboard, bringing in the extremists and the ending is laughable when the alien turns out to be in the likeness of her father. I did like the cinematography and as an amateur astronomer I liked the images of stellar objects, but the movie ends up sucking up to the lowest common denominator. C'mon Hollywood, I dare you, put more effort into making good movies, and leave the pandering to the media blitzing campaigns."
5,A Journey into the Unknown,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is insightful, engaging, and dares to be mysterious. Knowing it is based on Carl Sagan's book adds to the intrigue. I read a lot of science fiction. This movie is one of very few that allows me to maintain a great sense of wonder -- even though I already know the ending, I'd watch it over and over."
4,Required Viewing,"I read the book when it first came out and loved it. The movie was different, but fulfilling. It is an excellent treatment of material that is hard to express as a movie the masses will want to see. This is one of the few science-based films made; most are science-fantasy or space-operas. The DVD adds to the final product with audio commentaries and effects explanations. Read the book, buy the DVD and share it all with friends."
4,A fun sci fi story,I am not a Jody Foster fan but I really enjoyed this movie because of the science side of the story. They took a lot of pains to get the science fairly accurate and that made it easier for me to into the story. They even showed a bluish cast of the surroundings on the alien planet that would result from not having an atmosphere to screen out the blue part of the light spectrum. Having Carl Sagan write the book was obviously a benefit in the making of the movie. It must have provided a motive to make it as scientifically accurate as possible.
4,Pretty good Blu-ray of a Great Movie,"Great movie, if you haven't seen it already. The HD quality is pretty good, but the supplements on this Blu-ray disc aren't very comprehensive (certainly nothing new added since the old DVD). Menu design is bland, but if you can get this movie when it's on sale, then I'd say it's definitely worth it if you're a fan."
1,Contact,I liked the movie but got ripped off because the dvd stopped in the middle of the movie and I couldn't watch the whole movie. It sucks because I can't find a way to discuss this problem with anyone. I would not recommend using this company for dvd streaming.
1,Ripoff,"BUYER BEWARE ! The DVD I got was not the movie.It was a commentary about the movie ,not the actual movie. therefor I felt I was ripped off . I think the movie was great and I wonted to add it to my collection. So take heed and be sure to read the product description and get what you're paying for."
1,A horrible distortion of Carl Sagan's message,"Did Carl Sagan write this horrible movie ?! I expected something profound and spiritual... this is ""junk"". On a more positive note, the sense of wonder evoked by the introductory scene does persist in the rest of the movie. Too bad it is supported by ""junk"".Some positive (+) and negative (-) points :- The ""we all need beliefs"" argument rears its ugly head more than once. This is apparently the morale of the story.- Also according to this movie, prosperity and technology makes people less happy and connected (guess in the Middle Ages everyone was everyone's best buddy - crime ? wars ? what's that ?).- In this warped alternate universe, SETI is actually useful and approved by private individuals, instead of being a big government boondoggle for scientists.+ Shows that faith can only validate itself in violence.-+ ""Useful science"" and paranormal beliefs are both portrayed as negative."
3,A Solid Piece of Sci-Fi,You could buy worse films than this one. Its very entertaining but it does lag in spots. The acting is very good and the storyline is about something that everyone thinks about at one time or another. And there are the right amount of special effects to keep everyone happy.
3,Contact,"I read the book before seeing the film, always a mistake, as the one genre is not like the other. There are many constraints, primarily budgetary and temporal, to making a film from a book. By reading it after seeing the film one is not disappointed by the lacunae left from editing out ""extraneous"" material in the interest of brevity, and the written version allows the reader to enlarge on relationships and side plots. This instance was no exception. Although I enjoyed the characters, and certainly the actors chosen for the parts were perfect for them, I felt they were a little ""flatter"" than in the book despite being real people. I also preferred the resolution of the father-daughter situation in the book to that in the film. The best feature of the film was the opportunity to actually see some of the technology and locations of astronomical research."
2,PLEASE DON'T WASTE MY TIME WITH MOVIES LIKE CONTACT,"Unfortunatly, I wasted my time watching Contact. To tell you the truth, I expected much more out of this film, especially since it was written by science fiction genius Carl Sagan. Jodie Foster, however, gave an exceptional performance, while Matthew McConaughy's character had absolutely no purpose. Secondly, I was expecting more of an ending. I know that some people call it a genius ending, but I just don't get it. I felt like I was being ripped off. Robert Zemeckis stole my money, made me sit through two hours, expecting a smash ending, and... what do I get? A lame ending. Who needs that? There are plenty of movies with crappy endings. I do recommend viewing Contact, just for the sake of it. There are one or two moments that are entertaining. However, this is the type of film that can only be watched once."
2,Good right up until the very end . . . then . . .,"Believable, well-acted, and fascinating, right up until thevery end."
5,A top notch Bluray release!,"As others have stated, it would have been nice to have this in 16:9 widescreen format. But that is minor and does not decrease my rating of this Bluray release of Contact at all. This is by far the best this film has ever looked. A masterful transfer by Warner Brothers and another quality release that deserves to be in your movie library. 5 solid stars."
2,Could be good but it's not - DVD review,"I was so disappointed in this movie. First of all were the stereotypes (illusion of dead father, typical currupt politician, boss who cares only for himself, truth about ETs is hidden).Second, it's simply not developed. It is 'wanna-be' deep. It uses a lot of 'big' words to make the viewer think they are watching an intellectual movie when they are not.Third, pacing. The whole movie builds up to a 36 minute ending. This includes the all important following of the ET's instructions. By this point, I really didn't care.Fourth, depth. It tries to touch on many points that it never probes any of them in depth. To see politics in the Space Program I recommend The Right Stuff (even though it is cleaned up version of the space program). All the questions the aliens left Ellie with, that she never really probed them about.The 'reunion' scene has been done better in Star Trek.Pass this one up for a real thinker. There are a lot of good Sci-Fi movies out there."
5,for Carl,"This is science fiction, and should be watched as such. Many of the premises are credible, and many are incredible. I'm not sure that I would call 26 light-years as deep space (26 thousand ly would be), that would be our close neighbor, but it makes the possibility of a message being received and resent in 52 years. The first time I watched it, I was not thrilled, maybe since it seem too far-fetched. I recently saw it again and was able to enjoy as straight science fiction. I was not sure what to make of the relationship between the preacher (Matt), and Jodie Foster. I think he was added to buffer religious sentiments."
3,"Jodie is great as always, but....","Jody Foster is a wonderful actress and in the film she shines. Too bad there weren't some other actors in the film that could arise to her level of excellence. Her character is a person of intelligence, sensitivity, imagination......What was she doing hanging out with the ex-priest...Matthew what's his name. His character is a person of no substance...very surfacey kind of guy. Jody's character is a mature human being; Matthew plays an angst ridden teenager.Little too much of 2001: A Space Odyssey for my taste."
1,Science v. Religion,"The old Science v. Religion is a classic bout of the ages, but this incarnation of it was, sadly, lame."
1,Carl Sagan is probably rolling in his grave...,"I am a fan of Robert Zemeckis, however, I think he did not honor the memory of Carl Sagan when he made this movie. Zemeckis' style is very centered around character relationships development. I think that two of the greatest films that he has made certainly hit upon these points (Forrest Gump and Cast Away). The film version seems to lose the great character development that the book emphasizes. If you are going to buy this, make sure you read the book after you see the movie. This isn't to say that I think you should see anything more than the first scene, of course."
4,good suspense but too long,"I really enjoyed this film. Despite a slow start, the middle and the end of the film are GREAT. The audio commentary is very interesting, never boring. I expected many more ""Extra Features"". The film is superbe on large screen of projector."
5,One of the greatest pictures of 1997,"At the end of the year of 1997 i was a little bit disapointed for the pictures that were on the cinemas, but after seeing this one this apreciation changed. A great adaptation from the Carl Sagan book, it is a history that has the characteristic that acording to your beliefs gives to people diferent messages. Watch it with a wide criteria."
5,Best movie EVER,"This movie really makes you think - about politics, religion, science and ethics.Carl Sagan was a brilliant man and it is a shame he did not see the final result of his work. A real tribute to him that should not be missed by Anyone"
5,"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES, A MUST SEE","This is a movie that everyone should see at least once in there life. The movie was just really good. What makes it so good is that it is very believable, VERY BELIEVABLE, but yet leaves you wondering and thinking in the end...The movie just grips you and doesnt let go! The acting in it is amazing and this should have won a lot of awards. Everyone that i tell to watch this movie never really believes me that its good, they think its a typical sci-fi boring space movie... But after they watch it they sit back and are like WOW that was really good! its surprisingly VERY GOOD MOVIE. DEFINATELTY A MUST SEE!!! 5 stars!!"
4,Not bad,"The movie was phenominal in its day. But now looking back and watching it new, its interesting to see how nieve mankind really is in some of the things we assume in that movie.I also, have to say i do not like the fact that they see to demonize christianity at every chance in that movie"
5,Contact: A fitting legacy for Carl,"""Contact"" is one of my favorite movies of all time. The concepts it explores, both scientific and spiritual, are dear to my heart and not, as some believe, mutually exclussive. As long as imminently talented people like Robert Zemekis and Jodie Foster nurture the visionaries like Carl Sagan, Issac Asimov and those who follow, we will continue to evolve and we will do it in style. I am certain that some of those future visionaries will be inspired by this movie. Jodie Foster gives a dynamic performance, as good as anything she has done before. The special effects and the musical score are incredible. I have owned the VHS version of ""Contact since it became available and it was one of the first movies I purchased on DVD the first week I had my new player. This movie deserves a place in any video library and it is a must have for anyone who believes that we are not alone in the Universe."
2,No Science,"I do agree with the guy who wrote review from Los Angeles on May 11, 1999, this movie is about faith, God but REAL science. I can not understand: Since the woman came back without any evidence, why people just keep asking her, why don't they send another man into that wonderful ship again? And this movie just stop here with some words ""...I believe that"", ""...I believe her"".... Actually, you could believe anything and nothing real! Question: shall we believe that every one from us has had the outer-space experience in our night dream?The second star I gave to this movie is for the first 2 minutes and when the woman touching the sky with her finger.Nothing better than Year 2001 and Year 2010, not at all."
3,Fell asleep every time I tried to watch it,"Some movies are so compelling that, even if I start the movie after midnight after a full day of work, I can get through. I fell asleep three times trying to watch it. The buildup to the ""Contact"" was a let down when we actually experienced it. As for McConaughey, if he was so religious, why did he sleep with Foster in the beginning of the movie. The ""Contact"" scene had a ""What Dreams May Come"" quality to it. The only that made the movie worth seeing was Angela Bassett's revealation at the end. It's not a movie to avoid but I think you'll be disappointed."
2,Disappointing ending,The previews hyped this film so much. I had so many expectations trying to imagine what it would be once contact was established. This ending is all they came up with? What a waste!
2,Why Jodie...?,"This movie has just about everything right about it - apart from the usual ending which is totally ridiculous. If you were about to send someone into a machine which you didn't understand, to somewhere you had no idea about etc etc (aka Stargate experience) - why send Jodie? She spends the entire end of the movie crying - I can't really see a marine getting too affected by all that."
2,"A science fiction ""Field of Dreams"".","If you saw FIELD OF DREAMS, well, this is the sci-fi version of it, with a woman building a spaceship instead of a man building a baseball diamond. Like so many movies in all genres in recent years, it is overblown and pretentious, actually fantasy with the trappings of science fiction. It is technically excellent, of course. Movies with multi-million dollar budgets generally are. If you are looking for a movie that is really Serious with a capital S, don't miss this one. It is serious, all right, but it is not much fun."
4,Good mix of science fact and fiction,"It seems that the best science fiction is written by real scientists: Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, and Carl Sagan. Even though ""Contact"" is Sagan's only novel, it's a very good one, with a firm basis in real-world science. Adapted to the screen, it loses a lot, but the story is compelling, and the cast does a very good job of making it work. The special effects are impressive, too. One day, we may actually receive an interstellar welcome. The scenario presented in ""Contact"" may not be all that far off the mark as to how and what that message may be and how we'll work on reading it."
5,In my top 10,"My review of this movie can be summed up with this quotation from the movie: ""You wanna hear something really nutty? I heard of a couple guys who wanna build something called an 'airplane,' you know you get people to go in, and fly around like birds, it's ridiculous, right? And what about breaking the sound barrier, or rockets to the moon, or atomic energy, or a mission to Mars? Science fiction, right? Look, all I'm asking, is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision. You know, to just sit back for one minute and look at the big picture. To take a chance on something that just might end up being the most profoundly impactful moment for humanity, for the history... of history."""
5,A beautiful movie!!!,"That's all I gotta say, and I am picky about movies! I really enjoyed the great acting and the passion of everyone involved in the movie. And the way of crossing two different belief systems to the end was amazing work!"
2,Could have been so much better,"First, the very opening of the movie is fantastic - almost worth the discounted purchase price by itself.The special effects are really quite good.The acting ranges from good to poor but, is generally passable.The story development and character interactions are OK if one hasn't read the book.However, if one has read the book there is such a distortion of both characters and their interactions and loss of sophistication and nuance as to be quite maddening.Ah, for what might have been!"
2,Hokey Hollywood junk,"Everything wrong with Hollywood movies is found in this movie. The central concept of how the Earthlings would deal with knowledge of the existence of an alien civilization is dealt with in a superficial and melodramatic way. The actors' were all melodramatic, though some of this may be blamed on the screenplay. Foster gave a very bad and unconvincing performance. When push came to shove, she wimped out in her defense of her atheism (though that's the screenwriter's fault). She was horribly miscast. To this day, she still looks like a teenage tomboy. Only Skerritt and Hurt gave convincing and interesting performances. If you're watching this on cable, skip the first 40 minutes. If this is truly an accurate rendition of Sagan's novel (which I haven't read), then I owe the film's makers and actors an apology. But from a purely cinematic viewpoint, it's extremely disappointing."
2,Beware of bad discs!,The movie content is great! However the volume has to be opened up 300 percent to hear anything on this disc.
2,Disappointing!!,"Robert Zemekis' Sci-Fi flick is filled with potential. Great use of President Clinton images. Realistic usage of CNN anchors and reporters. It's special effects are visually stunning. The problem is the script. The storyline lags behind the technical portion of the film and in the end, it left me with a bad taste and plenty of open holes that are just not believable. It tries to be like ""Close Encounters..."" and ended up like bad religious version of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" without the nukes! I was just not impressed with this effort!! Sorry!!"
2,Silly and contrived effort,"This movie could have been better if it simply had aspired to be a science fiction movie only. Instead we are treated to a bad script, an annoying love affair, and an overly sophomoric and contrived ending. Loved the concept and special effects, but ended up feeling embarrassed for the actors and their performances."
2,Three little words: Read The Book.,"Read The Book.A brilliantly written saga dedicated to furthering mankind's intellect, outlook, and inner peace.The movie didn't understand that. It is dedicated to furthering the career of Jodi Foster. Little beyond that.Even if I am wrong (which happens), please read the book before embarking on the magical, mystical voyage of cliches that you will presented with here. You will be a better person for it."
2,Not bad until last the 1/4...,"...when it becomes at turns drearily predictable and unpredictably schmaltzy.The best thing about this film is Jodie Foster...so easy on the eyes, and such a talented actress to boot! She projects a very attractive spunkiness and tenacity which fit her slightly masculine features perfectly. The rest of the cast, which includes James Woods, Angela Bassett, and Matthew McConaughy (sp), are pretty competent but they can do only so much when the script goes south towards the end."
1,The most offensive movie I've seen in years,"This movie purports to be about science, but it posits science as something one takes on faith. I believe that would be religion. Science is about method and empiricism. Carl Sagan rolls in his grave, as do Einstein and newton.I'd sooner watch films of penile surgery."
1,"Pathetic, Uninvolving, New Age Mess","Silly, self-important nonsense masquerading as deep profound Science Fiction. Jodie Foster plays an utterly humorless and emotionally icebound BUT totally brilliant young woman (a type of role she is becoming tiresomely expert at) who is supposed to be carrying a torch for the appallingly inept Matthew McConaughey. The lack of chemistry between them makes a significant part of the story rather hard to swallow. Namely, one can't believe that Foster's walking iceberg has any interest at all in the McConaughey's inane all-purpose guru.This movie is to serious science fiction what a Hallmark card is to Shakespeare. Slight, admittedly rather efficient, but ultimately forgettable."
1,What a Bummer!,"Will anyone please explain to me why Foster meets her space alien - who turns out to be her own dead father - on a tropical beach? What is this supposed to mean? This film offends just about everyone: science fiction buffs, scientists, atheists, religionists, those who believe in aliens, those who don't, and most of us hoping for alien contact of the Spielberg kind. If you think there's going to be lots of interesting special effects, fast forward the film after the first five minutes to the last ten minutes. This should save you hours of boredom. Also, is this what Carl Sagan wrote? Shame on him if he did! Zemeckis's own Forrest Gump could write a better story! I have a feeling the book ought to be different, but after this movie I'm not interested enough to bother finding out...."
1,SAGAN'S FOLLY,"Foster and McConaughey land in bed the first day they meet?!! Give me a break. Like Mr. Garrison of ""South Park"" said, ""I waited two hours to see the alien and it turned out to be her G**D*** father!"""
1,"It took a long, long, long, long time","to sit through this crapfest. (not to desecrate an excellent Beatles song to describe this movie.) It's been done before, but Sci-Fi was never this...boring! you lose interest after the first hour of pure pretentious dialog, and it doesn't make up for it as the interesting parts (actually GOING through space, etc.) take up less than 2% of this, this pile of crap. When our Jodie actually meets an alien, it's her dad. Woo-hoo. Invest another half-hour and you can watch Titanic, with twice the emotion and quality, but if you're looking to be bored to death, Contact is the way to go."
5,Multi-dimensional,This movie is so layered that every time you watch it you catch something new and it makes you think of a multitued of possibilies.
4,Fantastic Movie!,"I have always loved this movie and the Blu-Ray version is fantastic! Though a little bit of artifacting can be seen as a result of the upscaling of the movie, overall its not terribly distracting and the audio is great (at least on my 2.1 sound system).If you love this movie, I recommend adding the Blu-Ray version of it to your library!"
3,Good image,"Excellent film, the image quality is very good, the audio option in Spanish is just directed to the public in Spain with Spanish accent, not neutral Castilian or latinExcelente película, la calidad de imágen es muy buena, la opción de audio en español esta dirigida para público de España, con acento español, no en castellano neutral o latino"
5,"Tight raps, bangin' beats!!!!!","BABY! ha,ha...... This music has me wantin' more. P.I.N.A has a great singing voice and the raps from Dougy D. and K. Cee put it over the top!"
4,"My Favorite Band, the Band of Renown","I am a die hard fan of Les Brown, so in my book there are no bad recordings by the Band of Renown. Only bad technical quality. However, I don't recall when Piccolino was ever a theme for the band. One of his best known recordings, Leap Frog is better known as the bands theme. The fact this CD is of lesser known recordings, not just the hits, Sentimental Journey, etc., makes this a recording worth buying."
2,Sentimental Journey,"Bought this CD for this one song, but it lacks all the verses. Just not what I expected."
1,not what expected,"Unfortunately, this was not what we wanted. Was in need of a bowl for our tree frogs to use as a 'pond'. This was way too small and lightweight. Purchased a heavier and larger rock bowl for our tree frogs."
4,Great Water Bowl for Small Box Turtle,"This product works for my small Box Turtle and is easy to clean and refill. The material is strong and has good weight to keep it from moving around in the aquarium. The product I got had small two tiny holes near the top of the ramp and thus I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. This product replaces a plastic plant tray I filled with water for my turtle. Overall, this product works and is priced right."
3,Not the color advertised,It was the size and shape I expected but not the color. It arrived light grey instead the dark reddish brown as shown in the pic.
2,Reptile Extra Large Bowl,"This is a nice bowl for my Russia Tortoise. It is the extra large size and she enjoys being able to go walk up the ramp into the water. I am disappointed though, because it leaks through the plug in the bottom and gets the substrate all wet. Now I am going to have to spend money on another, or find some kind of a resin patch."
5,Great Ramp Bowl,"I bought this for our first terrarium for our hermit crabs. We have a 5 gallon tank so this product worked well for us. After sloping the substrate from 4 inches down to 1 inch, I placed the ramp bowl in the corner toward the 1 inch side. The crabs have not tipped it over to date. I added their sponge to this bowl and it seems to work very well.But for our 2 crabs, this seems to be the perfect size. Will definitely order a larger one if and when we decide to get more hermit crabs."
5,Lightweight and good size,"I bought this for 2 tiger salamanders. It works great. I wanted something that they could crawl into and burrow under with out too much work. I set it on top of my moss and one of the tigers has made that its hiding spot. It is sturdy and light, just what I wanted."
1,Not Even Worth 1 Stars,"This has got to be the dumbest of all dumb movies , bad acting , bad story, bad film , not even worth one dollar"
3,The Aliens are cool,I won't say much here because it's all been said already. I will say that the Aliens look cool and I like the weapon that the kid finds.If you are a person that enjoys smoking dope or getting drunk while watching a movie then you won't go wrong with this choice.
2,Warning! Nostalgists Only,"Although watching Laserblast for me brings back a time when films like this were seen in abundance on Saturday afternoon television in the early eighties, and has a great, cheesy B-movie feel that you can only really get from films made in the seventies, it is a bad, bad movie. The acting is terrible, the plot makes little sense. (Who is the man in black and why doesnt he stop Billy when he gets the chance? Where are the people in the ""city"" scene at the end? Who are the guys in the plane?) but there is a bizzaro quality to it that will make it appealing to schlock lovers, mostly credited to the grunting green faced mutant-Billy. The DVD is in widescreen, but the trailer advertised on the box is nowhere to be found. The picture quality sadly does not improve much from the VHS version. If you remember seeing this way back when and look back at it fondly, by all means get it while its still available. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
5,Fools are digg'n deep on this one....HAAAAAA!!!,"I agree with all of you....there's a whole generation (Gen X..in my humble opinion) of men today that seen this obscure but very enjoyable film. It's up there with ""The Dark"" and others.....yes...we have seen a lot TV growing up in the late 70's!!! Mention this film at a party and brings together all types of peeps from various backgrounds....Analyst, Lawyers, Ex-Con's, Poor, Rich, the connected... Etc...Etc!!!! Thank God for Amazon...now if I can just find a reasonable copy of War of the Gargantuas....1966!!!!"
1,"Strange, campy '70s sci-fi","I can't recommend this movie. I saw it when I was 10 years old, and even at that age (and a sci-fi freak) I thought it was bad. Let me put it this way: I saw it as part of a double feature with Disney's ""The Cat From Outer Space"", and it made that poor excuse for entertainment shine in comparison. (Then again, there are a bunch of people that gave TCFOS 5 stars on Amazon, so maybe I'm off base? Whatever.)Think ""Corvette Summer"" with cheesy special effects. Only for the avid collector of bad '70s sci-fi."
1,retarded in so many ways,"this movie was a cult ill give it that, but the whole idea of a lasergun that would turn you into a rabid freak, is totally insane! it is rated PG, but there is a nude scene. The guy that does mandarks voice on dexters lab, plays a character"
1,Ripped off ...!,"I also own the 2002 version. I planned on taking the GMAT several months ago but, due to recent world events, I had to deploy overseas just before my test date. Now that I've been out of ""study-mode"" for 8 months, I thought Kaplan's latest version would be a good way to build upon the 2002 version.WRONG!At least for the GMAT portion of this package, the introductory test and lessons are no different than the ones on the 2002 version. I don't know if the GRE or LSAT tests are different, but the GMAT IS EXACTLY THE SAME!Save yourself ... and buy the 2002 version- it's worth 5-stars."
2,It could have been a good product,"If it was designed better. First, during lessons, there is this annoying voice over talking all the time. You cannot concentrate on reading. Then, the program is trying to be... funny. What for? GMAT is not a comedy. I want to study not laugh. Next - the lessons are designed very badly. You really cannot learn from them at all.There is a room on the market for a good GMAT software, hopefully someone will make it. This is not it, thats for sure."
1,Buy the actual tests,"I don't see why people buy anything fromKaplan, Princeton Review, and Barron's etc.when they can purchase the actual tests.Each one of these ""prep"" tests are differentin some shape or form from the real test.Usually the questions are as not well thoughtout as in the actual tests. Many times theyare more complicated or less complicated than required.I can't think of one reason to buy their products."
2,Yawnsville,"Okay, so the first half hour is pretty entertaining. After that it descends into tedious boredom. Not enough fight scenes, not enough T&A;, and no monsters. There is a cowardly canine companion, however. So yeah, skip it unless your a die hard 80s sword and sorcery completist. If youre interested in exploring director Matt Cimber's work, I suggest you start with his crucial work; The Black Six.The package is awesome. Nice print, widescreen, good special features, a CD containing Ennio Morricone's score, and a somewhat amatuerish comic book. I almost kept my copy just for the audio CD, as I'm a Morricone fan, but in the end this one got traded in."
3,hundra review,"Hundra was a good movie for a rainy day it had action,humor and a little drama.I don't recomend to people who don'tlikea just good sword and sandal movie."
3,How to destroy a franchise,"1) Take out everything that made the first two games cool2) Add new crap that doesn't work and makes you want to punch the developer in the face.3) Come up with the most god awful plot and unbelievable events to ever grace the 360 to date.Controls are a nightmare. I could go in the bathroom with a notebook and take a crap and come out with a better control scheme than this. I also now have the god-like ability of making a door swing open to hit my opponent by merely making a gesture with my hand. This is crap. But worst of all, AND I MEAN WORST OF ALL, is that the cool finishing/blazing moves that I loved from the first two are nowhere to be found.I guess it wouldn't be THAT bad of a game if I wasn't comparing it to the first two but this is retarded when a franchise of this calibur switches to better graphics on a next-gen system and comes out being not even close to the equivalent of the other two. I can smell Electronic Arts from here. And they smell like garbage."
4,Fight....for a day,"The game has defenetly improved in graphics since its last tittle, fight for NY. The controls are easy to master but the counters are a bit tricky to use. One of the major options in this game is the ability to use your own sound track in the fighting scenes. In general you donthave to be a hip hop fan to enjoy this game, you can fight to punk, rock, metal or if you like.....classical. The enviroment will come alive with whatever music you choose. The only down fall to the game is that you can finish it in one day, if your really devoted to it. It has a medium replay value and the mini game of managing your rappers sales is a good way to earn money to buy bling. Overall, i beleive the game is worth buying, its fun and what better way than to releive strees than kicking the crap out of your friends."
1,horrible,"this has got to be the worst game that i have ever played. i have have the first 2 games and this was a complete let down. i have never been so frustrated playing a game in a very long time. it's very repetative and there's not much to do in the game itself. i honestly dont recommend the game for anyone, its that bad."
1,Icon is quite a few steps back from past great Def Jam games.,Compared to any other Def Jam game his one should not exist!!! Its been out for quite a few years longer but DJ Fight for New York is leaps and bounds past this title.My biggest peve is theres no power meter to judge how much life each opponent has but instead the screen gets really red....thats just one nag among the 15 others on the top of my head.
1,"Boring, non sense, No!",Did you play Def Jam fight for NY?That was a fighting game... I tought that this one was going in the same way but ooh deception.Not recomended at all!
3,Def Jam 2,yeah i like def jam ny betterthis. is just an ok game.. the controls from DJNY to this DJI are not same in any way.. . jkMicrosoft shoulda made the 360 able to read n play DJNY
2,repetitive frustating and slow moving,this game have a pretty solid create a charater and the story line is somewhat interesting. i also like the way you can dress your charater in the latest fashions. The graphics look pretty cool when you first start. on the negative side is the fighting mostly this being a fighting game i dont recomened it. the amount of charaters that you have to choose from is weak the last game had alot more. your gonna hear the same couple of songs over and over if your favorite song is on the game it won't be your favorite for long. i got this game for $60 plus tax the game is'ent worth $20 I say if you dont belive me rent it hate it and take it back.
4,Not the same as the previous games but still fun!,"Yes this game is different from the previous Def Jam games but it's not as bad as most people are saying it is. There are some things to get used to which makes it frustrating for someone who liked the original games.But then again, each Def Jam game has been different from one another.In Def Jam Icon it's a whole different fighting system. Unlike the last games you have to actually use the song while fighting. You must use the rhythm of the song to your advantage. You use the songs and the rappers differently.Overall with the exception of the short storyline the game was very enjoyable."
1,Wow...,"This game is a let down. I was waiting for the next installment for a long time, (over a year). I would think any game in production for longer than a year would be, at the very least, mediocre. WRONG. This game doesn't make it past unsatisfactory, not by a long shot. As many others have stated the controls are terrible. I actually controled the game better with a banana peel, and one of those paper fortune tellers. People ""give it up"" for the grafix. I won't agree. They are not impressive. That might be biased on my part because, I read reviews that compared them to real life. That is my fault. The sound track. I'll leave it at that. Story you ask? Not very good, I reply. In the end this game was a waste of time. If I was the CEO of EA, I would work on hiring a full time wizard to give people the time they wasted back."

1,The worst game I ever played!!!,"I have played several 007 games and this one is the worst.Tomorrow Never Dies is alot more fun.There are several things you can not do in The World Is Not Enough that you can do in Tomorrow Never Dies. You can not do stunts and stealth attacksyou can not shoot out windows and blow up things,the enemies do the same thing every time you kill them,the levels are not very detailed and they are very hard and worst of all,there are no good cheat codes for this game.I do not reccomend this game to anyone!"
4,OK,Its a good game but not as good as Goldeneye.I reccomend you rent it first.Its a good FPS though.
5,"""Bond............James Bond!!""","""The World is not Enough"" is a true James Bond game as it has high speed action all throughout as u follow the adventures of the world's top secret agent. The game follows the storyline of the movie and even has superb clips from the movie before and after each level of the game as an extra bonus.The graphics are also great for a ps-one game and it exceeds the expectations I had of it.The game offers over 20 high-teach, way cool gadgets from Q's lab. There is also an improved AI from the other James Bond games as characters have more realistic features which make them seem more human-like.This game is one of the best games on the ps-one console and as usual I hope - JAMES BOND WILL RETURN"
3,Great game,"This game is really fun. I really liked how it incorporated clips from the movie and how much it really follows the plot line of the movie also. Cool gadgets, not much thinking involved, though. It's a great game for someone who just wants to veg out and shoot people with a silenced walther ppk. Or if that's not your bag, then you could always try out one of the few different machine guns. I would have liked to see more guns."
3,Not up to the usual standards for Commander Bond,It's fun but that begins to wear thin after a while. It lacks real depth and imagination. It obviously was packaged and marketed to coincide with the film. Unfortunately the product should have been properly developed to meet the needs and expectations of 007 fans. This is quite a letdown for Commander Bond.
2,Bond James uhh I forgot whoops!,This in my opinion is not a very good game! It has poor graphics poor gameplay and does not follow the storyline! Some of the mission are so ridiculous that there not even worth trying!No multiplayer yes no multiplayer! This is a bad version of the game! If you want a good version of this game get it on N64 it has multiplayer and alot of others!This in my opinion is not good!
3,BOOO,"At first I found it was quite a cool game, but then after I realised that there was not much to it and less fun than 'Tomorrow Never Dies.' In that one there is a car and skiing but in this game the only skiing you are doing is in one level and it is not proper skiing. Perhaps the weapons and the picture were better but 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is more fun."
4,Good game but easy!,This game was the best shooter game I played in years and the graphics were super. Although I thought it was extremely easy. I mean I beat the game in 1 week. I was extremely disappointed when my mom bought the game and returned it in a week. Although their was many weapons to choose from and challenging objectives. I would buy this game after you rent it.
2,Definately not GoldenEye,"Although this isn't a bad game, this game is a far cry from Nintendo 64's GoldenEye. It has no multiplayer mode, a limited arsenal and presents no real challenge. So if you've never played GoldenEye, you'll probably like it. But if you have, don't expect the same level of game play ( i recommend renting first)"
2,TWINE sucked on PS1!,"The Nintendo 64 version was much better-It had better controlls,Better graphics and Most of all had MULTIPLAYER!,Everything in the PS1 version just simply sucked apart from it had better Audio.But don`t get me wrong neither versions stood up to Goldeneye,and to this day no Bond game does(Latest Bond game is From russia With love).TWINE(PS1):5.2-MEDICRETWINE(N64):8.4-GREATGOLDENEYE:9.3-SUBPERBPerfect Dark:9.5/10-Better than Goldeneye!"
3,Not the best bond game but still an o.k game.,For one the controls can get annoying. The missions are difficult! I am close to beating it i got like 3 levels left and i am totally stuck on it. I know what to do but it is physically impossible! I guess its an o.k game if you are a fan of the 007 games. It is better then the n64 version which sucked! But overall its an o.k but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who gets frustrated easily and are not a fan of the 007 games.
3,"A good shift from ol' Seattle, but it's outdated.","This sourcebook describes the United Kingdom of the Shadowrun Universe, with its misteries and dangers. It presents all info in the Shadowland Style, with some hilarious comments, and has the same high-quality graphics as all Fasa Products. The book also presents rules for druids and new totems. The catch is, it was one of the first sourcebooks, written for SR1. So, most of the rules presented don't fit in with SR3 or even SR2, and probably have been incorporated into the game. And the History section lacks some ten years (it stops around 2050). Anyway, it's a good book if you intend to run the UK, but be aware that some hard updating work needs to be done."
2,If you like to blame yourself ...,"People who like to blame themselves will love this book.Unfortunately, blaming other peoples behavior for your own failure to incorporate a belief system into your life, isn't particularly honest.True, there are some Orthodox Jews who lead less than exemplary lives. But, this is not a function of their Orthodoxy as Ms. Margolese would like us to believe. People who blame others for their own failures, simply cannot confront their own problems.Unfortunately, the truth is that people who leave Orthodoxy do so for a myriad of reasons, none of which are honestly explored in this book. As someone with a sociologist's background, I would have, at least, expected, a legitimate sociological analysis to support her conclusions. All she provides is carefully selected anecdotal evidence to support her thesis."
2,need a magnifying glass,I used to subscribe to tuffstuff all the time but since I've slowed down in the collecting world I stopped subscribing. I did however subscribe a year ago just to kinda keep up with things. WOW did they cut back! You can't even read it anymore. They've made the print so small that you need a magnifying glass to read it. I'll find another source for my information.
2,What did 18V turn into?!?!?,"If you're a fan of old 18V do not pick this CD up if you're not into collecting CD's. They have COMPLETELY changed their sound. All these people who listen to Good Charlotte and Lost Prophets (or whatever pop punk band is famous now) will love this CD. The people who give this CD 5 stars are the same ones who have probably never listened to an old 18V CD. To the people who are harrassing the reviewers that are giving this CD a bad review, we've been 18V fans for a long time. They let their real fans down. I didn't have the heart to give them a 1 star..."
4,not the greatest obsession........but okay,"Poor old Eighteen Visions......THey just can't seem to figure out what their going to do. Their last record ""Vanity"" Was a good blast of Metalcore/Hardcore rage and fun. Now, with this, they seem to go more for a rock approach. Are they tired of the musical climate they helped innovate, or are they tired of being dubbed ""fashioncore"" or faggots, just because of the way they dress? I don't know. This album was just alright for me. Hopefully, their new Self Titled album will be at least a small return to form.Favorite songs: ""obsession,"" ""I let go,"" ""This time"", ""Bleed by yourself."""
5,They Gone'd and Dun it agian!,"This album is nothign short of perfect. Although it almost sounds like an entirely different band, this album is their greatest! A lot of people are probably going to hate it because on a heavy scale, if Vanity was a 6, and Best of was an 8, Obsession is a 3. While the album is not very heavy, it has a lot to offer musically. The opening track starts off with an almost techno beat then goes into pretty much what you'd expect from this band. But the next trach is, I have to admit, radio rock. But it is still one of their best songs. The main difference on this album is that most songs are 90% singing, and are very catchy. But, there is still screaming in breakdowns and such. Some songs almost sound like Stone Temple Pilots, some sound like Finch, and other sound just different in general. The best 3 tracks are ""Tower Of Snakes"", ""I Let Go"", and ""I Should Tell You..."" (which is well... an emo song). This record is still flawless."
3,"great cd, but not that great",i bought this cd without hearing what the band sounds like (which i do a lot since i have bmg music service and get a lot of free cd's). I wasn't dissapointed with the cd but i wasn't really moved either. the band lacks a real unique sound. It kinda sounds like all the other metal/pop on the radio and MTV. If you like music like that you will probably love this cd. If you don't you'll probably like it
4,Different...But Good,"If you are a big Trustkill freak, you NEED to get this. If your not, you may want to listen to this one a few times over before you decide on making a purchase. Eighteen Visions obviously is influenced by a lot of Punk bands, and this CD shows it. You can tell that they have some Punk in them by listening to the guitar riffs in some of their songs on ""Obsessions"". Even though it seems that this band has some Punk in them, the brutal melodies and ear-piercing screeches that most Trustkill bands express are still present. Their lead vocalist really knows how to sing, and it compliments the band's guitars and bass very well. The drums are also great. If you like this CD, then you should also pick up a copy of ""This Is Love, This Is Murderous"" by Bleeding Through, or ""The Oncoming Storm"" by Unearth. Both bands are similar to Eighteen Visions."
1,what the hell is this,"if you like what eighteen visions used to be, then you're going to HATE this album. they used to play quality hardcore. now they just sound like this trash i hear on the radio everyday. that's right, eighteen visions has just turned into another hot topic band. Seen you'll see kids wearing parachute pants and huge studded bracelets wearing their t-shirts. i'm sorry they have to give up what they were good at and sell out. but this is just my opinion. if you like what you hear on the radio these days, you'll probably love this cd. but otherwise, avoid at all costs."
1,how many bands can we try to sound like in one album?,"From this question, thus 18v was born. This band is worshipped around where I live and I just don't get it. They really suck. The vocalist tries to sound like Chino Moreno and Scott Weiland all through the disc, and it's quite obvious. Every song follows the same formulas in song structures. Verse/chorus/shorter verse/chorus/sometimes a bridge/chorus/end. There is only like a minute worth of good material on this CD and it is the brutal as hell breakdown on track 5 (of which the rest of the song is horrible) Their older stuff isn't any better either. This just isn't a good band. Extremely annoying and over-rated."
1,Whos the sellout?,"To the ""Funk"" guy below me who talks about how this band sold out so ""all the teenyboppers on mtv"" would like them, you say your favorite band is Avenged Sevenfold? Um, last time i checked, they sold out even more than any band ive ever listened to. They are one of the most played bands on MTV now and your criticizing 18V for trying to get played on MTV??? What a hypocrite! Avenged sevenfold sucks now, and so do youI dont even listen to 18V, i just left this review cuz your an idiot"
4,CHIPPER,"got some catchy parts, nice guitar work, totally different from all other previous albums. the singing is new and improved, it makes for a good listen on the ride down to the beach, but there are some heavy parts too, lets not forget that my friends. heres what some people may be saying. ""what the hell, why isnt it all screaming, james and the boys have gone soft!"" theres still a thousand other bands with screaming, i love screaming too, but theres a good mix in this album, melodic and enjoyable, short but sweet."
5,IMPRESSIVE,"18V has really taken it to a new level with Obsession. Don't get me wrong Vanity was good, but Obsession is even better. I would reccomend this CD to everyone. There are so many different musical elements that I believe could appeal to almost anyone. Trust me this is a CD you don't want to pass up. Do yourself a favor and get it today. I cross my heart you wont regret it."
1,Selling Out,"Well....I bought this cd cuz this band was opening for my favorite band (Avenged Sevenfold)......and it sucked. Reading these reviews, hearing people say they sold out and others say they didn't. Well first off, getting yourself on a big label isn't truly selling out, I agree. But changing your music in a big way so that all the teenyboppers on mtv will like it truly IS selling out. This band sure as hell did it. Earlier cds are much better than this one. This cd sounds like it could have come out 10 years ago, just without the screaming (which is minimal). Tell the guys to start over from scratch."
2,"Pick up ""Best Of"" instead","Most bands mature and get better with age. Not 18V, This CD is still not a bad CD by any means, but its still not ""keeping it real"". Its just not the 18V that the most die hard of fans fell in love with, no breakdowns, or the hard driving rhythms that made 18V who they are today!, There is just nothing on this offering that made the past 18V albums so metal. I do like the fact that James Hart has a good voice, and carries the music well. Jason S. made a good decision by leaving this band and sticking to what made ""Saved by Grace"" who they are! I hope Cali falls off into the ocean!! Congrats 18V, you are now a pop band, hope that you are proud that can go tell your friends how well your jouney to being the next ""Guns N Roses"" is going. Will you do my hair James?"
1,Just leave it alone.,"Eighteen Visions - ObsessionI really thought there was good reasoningbehind buying this new 18V album, but I was wrong.Even after Vanity, which wasnt as bad, I thought maybetheir roots would at least show a little on this album.Wrong again. The production and sound is really goodbut the music , lyrics, and James voice is horrible. Theopening song is such a dissapointmentand sets a bad tone for the rest of the album, personally the onlyonly song I can stomach is ""Tower of Snakes""I know bands change,but somtetimes a turn for the better is needed, and I honestly dont thinkthe band can listen to this and be satisfied with the final product. If I werein this band I would beg Trustkill to pull this from the shelves.(2/10)Recommended if you like: Velvet Revolver - Contraband and EighteenVisions - Vanity"
4,pleasantly surprised,"When I first checked this band out, I was ready to lump them in with the ENDLESS amount of copycat screamo/hardcore bands..screaming one minute and crooning the next about their girlfriend. I was happy to find they weren't like that. They actually write catchy songs..and I even sensed some old school thrash riffing in there that really makes your head bang. I like this cd and hope they continue in this style."
3,good but not like before by artand crimes,this harcore metal band from o.c. ca came up with their third complete album (obsession) this album its good but its not as hard as their first one (untill the ink runs out) but this guys puk a heck of a show and i got to give it to them the albums sounds grat live so if u have the chance catch them at warped tour and check this album out.
4,obsession... desire... no depression here though,"alright, so here it is, a cd that was 2 years in the making and i have to say i think this record is pretty exceptional.for those who said there were a hardcore band, your view of hardcore is warped. no, 18v, was a metalcore band, about as metal as you can be without being a full blown metal band. this record is more mature than anything they've done in the past. a lot more singing, and a different singing style provided by james hart.this record, believe it or not, kicks bleeding through's ass, for anyone who said this record is a disappointment to them, and the new throwdown is a lackluster korn ripoff with breakdowns, at best.this record, though i'll admit bares a striking resemblence to that of stone temple pilots, is probably one of the better records trustkill has released as of late.download a couple songs, see if you like 'em, don't buy it if you're expecting nothing besides metallic riffing with big pit clearing breakdown parts."
2,Blah!,"I am no hardcore afficianado to speak of, but I am a huge Eighteen Visions fan, and frankly ""Obsession"" just doesn't cut it for me. There are some high points, but that is not the point of any album I am supposing.Even after three listens I am not impressed. I thought ""Vanity"" was sort of step down from the totally intense sound of ""Until the Ink Runs Out"" and ""The best of"", but ""Obsession"" is just a fall down a flight of stairs.I am truly bummed that the album came out the way it did. This is not a hardcore album, and do not buy it if you think it is. James Hart comes of sounding like Scott Weiland half of the time."
5,Job well done,"true, the new disk is very different from their previous albums. although Obsession does feature some slower, more mellow songs like ""i let go"", ""i should tell you"" and ""lost in a dream"", their heavyness is still present throughout the album. ""this time"" combines hard rock verses with a booming sing along chorus. and eighteen visions' hardcore roots are clearly evident on ""Tower of snakes"" which features a HUGE, mosh-ready breakdown and powerful chorus. the solo featured in ""crushed"" has a very classic feel to it, but it still fits perfectly with the in-your-face guitar riffs. every song on this album is exciting. 18v did an amazing job creating an enormously diverse, yet strong and powerful soundtrack to those driven by obsession, desire, and depression(as well as anyone else into heavy music)...overall, a creative and true hard rock/ metal/ whatever you call them album...LOVE"
2,More from Mem Fox,"I'm a fan of Mem Fox. I use her books in my class. This one, Hunwick's Egg,is a little disappointing. The main character finds an egg and we all expect it to hatch. But it doesn't and I missed the point of the book.If you like Mem Fox's books, then give it a try."
4,More than just an exercise book,"This book is divided into four sections, the first two of which form a fascinating 31-page essay that begins with observations about architecture and clothing style expressing a society's body image, recounts ""old cultural prejudices"" in the west that the body is sinful, and relates the essence of physical exercise to mystical practices.The third section is an introduction to Psychocalisthenics that explains the purpose of each subset (""series"") of exercises in it. The five series revitalize five anatomical cavities, which awaken five corresponding centers of awareness (five realms, not four planes). The final section is a pictorial description of how to do the exercises.The text promotes the set of exercises to a general audience, so the references to mysticism are short and sometimes sketchy. Because Ichazo speaks to a 1984 readership, the book is slightly dated, particularly when addressing ""current"" trends in exercise."
5,The Best Way to See New York: Through a Beer Glass,"With its useful maps and anecdotal entries, this pocket-sized guide is the perfect companion for a day or a lifetime spent in the New York metropolitan area. It lists location, atmosphere, menu items, tap and bottled beer brands of all the important and some not so important watering holes in NYC and beyond. I never leave home without it. I am constantly making notes and additions to it though as it is slowly become dated. I only pray there is a revised edition on the way."
4,Excellent all-round introduction to Castoriadis' work,"Cornelius Castoriadis was one of the most original thinkers of this century and this book provides a good entry point for those interested in the matters his thought touches upon; Society, Philosophy, Autonomy, Psyche. It also provides, for those somewhat familiar with his work, an insight on the way his thought changed historically. Of particular interest, the last chapter includes an interview with the man himself in which he answers some of his critics. However, you must read some of his other publications if you want more in-depth treatment of the various subjects."
3,Good Clubs,Good set of clubs. The customer service rep was very helpful in replacing one of my clubs which had a loose head. Good weight and response. Easily drives over 200 yds. Build quality is decent. Not the greatest but great for the price. I would recommend for beginners.
4,Good buy,"This hammer is one that I've been looking for. It is just the right size for my jewelry projects and the price is right. Most of the crosspeen hammers are too big, if you can find them."
4,Great Ideas,This is a very colorful presentation of letterheads and logos. Each page has a large picture of the letterheads and business cards -- makes it easy to view and spur ideas. Each page is dedicated to only one letterhead design - so you can see the details!
2,Strange smell and taste,"Strange/odd smell. Also, the taste is just odd. It doesn't taste like Vanilla to me. It doesn't say organic anywhere on the packaging though it states so on this Amazon description. If you find something better, please share/comment. I'm going to search for something else that is organic, vanilla ground bean."
2,Not great,"Disappointed with the lack of flavor in this vanilla. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the vanilla had an unusual taste. Would not purchase again."
3,Ragamuffins of the Fifth Ward,"I enjoyed the book because Shamokin is my home area. After reading the book I purchased books for relatives. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you charged me $3.95 per book for postage & handling and the three books were shipped together. If I'm not misttaken, the postage & handling cost more than the books! Does that sound fair to you? Thank you.-"
4,Excellent Ambient Music in Surround Sound,"This is one Diatonis' finest pieces of work next to Ambient Life. I found I connected to it on more of an emotional level. It isn't ear candy but rather music that subtlety evokes an emotional response. The surround sound element really enhances this effect as well. I would not suggest buying this album if you want to disassociate for your current state of mind. It simply won't let you, it's deep. The sound of the album reminds me of Eno in some places but is primarily in a category of it's own. It is a CDR and I've had no problems playing the album but apparently some 5.1 systems can't play a cdr.Great Album!"
3,Not Versatile,"This is a very limited versatility 400 speed film better suited to the studio than real life applications. I've found that it is grainy unless used in a very controlled environment. Even good lighting outdoors produces less than satisfactory results. Odd that it performs poorly outdoors when Kodak states it's intended for outdoor use. It's been my experience that it is terrible outdoors with overblown shadows, uneven and grainy images, as well as too much contrast for a portrait film. With the right lighting, the film does produce very pleasing skin tones. However, the amount of work that requires is frustrating unless you are a primarily and most comfortably a studio photographer. If you do much shooting outdoors, skip it."
2,Questioning price,"Why is this book, Painting Snow and Water being sold used for $59 when the bar code on the back cover says it is $19?"
4,Musical Showers : Enhancing your bathing experience,This product is a must have if you like singing in the shower. The built in mirror is handy for those in shower shaving moments.
1,warning,all i can say is dont buy this item because the seller will take your money but u wont receive anything in the mail. i ordered it like 8 months ago and still have not received the cd so dont buy it!.
2,Not as Great as Lead to Believe,"The book was almost 99% pictures which was to be expected and I liked the color illustrations, but my biggest gripe is the lack of written detail about the battle. Four pages just doesn't cut it and on the first page, the author mentions military units that just didn't exist at that time or played a part in the battle. He mentions the IVth Panzer Korps, which I believe he means the XLVIIIth Panzer Korps. The German 2nd Caucasus Army is mentioned, and no such unit existed unless he's talking about Army Group A. Its easy to make a book of pictures, but if your going to write about something, it would be nice if the person doing the writing knew what he was talking about."
5,VERY GOOD,I totally diagree with the other reviewer. I thought Sean and Olmos were great together on screen. The movie kept me on the edge and Sean looked beautiful as always. I have this movie in my film collection as I'm a huge fan of Seans. I definitely wasn't let down. I would give it a very good rating!!!
1,Awful,"One of the worst movies of all time. If you remember Olmos from his powerful brooding character in ""Miami Vice"", you'll be surprised to see him with terrible lines, a squeaky voice, and a ponytail. Sean Young, who played the beautiful android in Blade Runner, simply doesn't know how to act. The script is terrible. Literally, 10 minutes in, you'll have figured out the entire plot. Awful."
4,A must for those interested in the South Seas,"In this book, the authors make what seems to be an autobiographical account of a year of traveling and adventure throughout the South Seas. They decide to travel in different directions and meet again after a few months. They write in turn about their own experiences and stories as narrated to them by other characters, covering a wide range of stories, from the mere description of island's habits, to beautiful native stories, to what must be the most thrilling and yet poetic treasure hunt I have read. Possibly a slightly minor work from this authors, better known for the Bounty books. Yet, if you like the mystery of the South Seas a little more than its adventure, add that fifth star to my rating. Please bear in mind my comments are based on a first edition of this book, dated 1921, which I own. I write the review in the hope that it will be useful since there is none to date, but I have not actually read this new edition."
3,Broke within 1 week,"I bought this toy for my son. The toy broke within 1 week. The pond sticks and keeps saying the same thing over and over again, the blocks, when put into place, sing the same song, one short verse, over and over again. Unfortunately, the little birds get stuck saying the same things as well. It wasn't worth the money for us. My son does like the shapes though. Hope this is helpful as a lot of reviews have been for me. Thanks."
2,fun but watch out,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 7 months old. I thought the toy was great and so did she. It was her favorite toy for weeks until a block got stuck in her mouth.After this happened a second time, I threw the toy in the trash. I am so surprised that Fisher Price would make a toy that could be dangerous to babies. I was thinking of getting rid of the blocks and keeping the birdbath but the blocks were her favorite part. She enjoyed taking them out, listening to the sounds and playing with them. I had to literally pull the block out of her mouth because it was stuck. Luckily my daughter wasn't hurt, just very upset. This toy is very cute but please watch out if you're buying it for your little one."
4,Nice but doesn't attach to Learning House ....,"My 1 year old enjoys this toy as much as her other toys (average) but I was disappointed that it didn't go with the Learning House as well as I'd hoped. The indention on the side of the base of the Learning House was bugging me because it looked like something was missing there (the empty ""cradle"" for the phone next to the phone book bugs me too by the way) so I bought the bird bath thinking it went there. If that is where it is supposed to go, it doesn't fit into the indention very well, doesn't attach to the base at all and the colors don't even match exactly. On its own it is nice and I've gotten compliments from friends. It is in a separate part of her playroom as the Learning House now though."
2,STUTTERING BIRDBATH,"I thought this was the cutest toy, so for Christmas I bought it for my daughter. In two days the singing birds would get ""stuck"" and stutter until you turn it off. Very disappointing!"
3,Looks cute but not worth the money!,Save your money - I recently purchased this toy for my 8 month old son. I have since returned the toy. Overall he was not thrilled with it. What bothered me about the toy is that it was so noisy - all the music would go at the same time and it sounded terrible. It also didn't seem to be constructed well - my son is quite strong with his hands and arms and I believe with time he could easily break off the bee on this toy. Just not overall impressed.
3,"Great Toy, but quickly broke","My daughter recieved this as a gift for christmas. It was wonderful because she had been having a hard time learning to sit up. But this toy made her want to sit up. Within a week of christmas she was sitting on her own. It's now midway through January, she still loves the toy, but I believe it has a short in it. It keeps repeating itself like a broken record. It's not even a month old, and it's already broken. If it didn't break so soon, I would have given it 5 stars all around."
2,very dissappointing toy!!,"I saw this toy and REALLY wanted to get it for my 10 month old for christmas. it was much smaller than I though it would be. within a month something went haywire, and now the music and bird voices get stuck and keep repeating until you turn it off!! Its so cute, but their really isnt much to it, and my daughter could actually care less about it, even when I play with it with her. overall this was dissappointing considering the $24.99 cost for the toy."
4,"Great, colorful, and loaded with activity.","My 8-month old received this gift and is enthralled with it. We've had great fun with it in just the 24 hours she's had it. The colors and the various things that this toy has are quite engaging. I have to say the one draw-back for her is it's height. When sitting in front of the toy she can play with it as any child her age and ability can. However, when she hits certain features on the top part with her hands, it sometimes causes the toy to topple toward her and bang her in the face, making her cry. No injury, just hurt feelings."
1,What do you do with this toy?,"I thought this toy looked adorable on-line and had to have it for my 10 month old daughter. However, compared to the pictures it is very small. There is really not much to do with this toy for the money paid. You can not press the buttons with numbers on them. All you can do is slap the blue bird bath water and then it will count for each time you slap it. The birds are not removeable and bounce up and down when you hit them. As for the bee that is under the bird bath it is so small that my daughter does not even notice it and it doesn't make much of a noise. My 2 year old son is not even interested in it and he plays with all her other toys. I would not recommend this toy."
2,Not as durable as you think,"While this toy has great educational potential and is aesthetically pleasing, I eventually threw ours out. It kept getting stuck on one annoying, repeated sound, which was clearly not intended, and no matter how much my daughter or I tapped or pushed or pulled other items to try to spur a different sound, it wouldn't stop. The only way to stop it was to turn it off -- which meant it wasn't interesting, because it doesn't light up or make noise when it's turned off. Maybe we just got a bad one, but I won't buy it or recommend it for anyone else, just in case."
3,Birds smash little fingers!!,"My 6 month old got this for Christmas and right away he loved it! Especially the little birds on top, but unfortunately he has gotten his fingers smashed several times bobbing them up and down! He is also at the stage of pulling up and has fallen with it several times causeing hurt feelings from getting hurt by his favorite toy! But overall, he enjoys it and plays with it all the time! Just wish we could tame those birds!"
2,Vegetables got stuck in my babies mouth,I also experienced a problem with the vegetables getting lodged in my daughters mouth. I gave this toy to her when she was 6 months old. We took the vegetable pieces away from her and let her play with the rest of the toy because she does love it. Be sure to carefully supervise your baby if they are playing with the vegetable pieces.
1,Great toy... for a few days... before it breaks,"Bought this for my 9 month old. She loved it. For a few days. Then the electronics broke and now it just repeats the same 3 words over and over again like a broken record. Probably wouldn't have been a n issue if I had bought it from a store and could return it, but Amazon's return policy makes this difficult now that I've thrown the box away.Either buy another toy or buy this toy from a store and avoid amazon, in case it needs to be returned."
3,my daughter loved it...but had a piece wedged in her mouth,"Bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old and she absolutely loved it. Played with it every day while ignoring other toys...read the reviews before purchasing it and another reviewer commented that one of the leaves on the vegetables became wedged in her childs mouth. My daughter constantly had the vegetables in her mouth, I believe they were probably her favorite part of the toy along with the BZZZZing bee. But last week she too got the toy wedged in her mouth and I really had to work to get it out...luckily no teeth were chipped and she turned out to be fine. Needless to say the toy was put away and I called Fisher-Price who had me return the toy at their expense and will send me a refund of the purchase price. I believe if more people called the company when they experience a problem the toy could be restructured as a safer toy for babies in the future."
1,Be careul with the teethers!!!!,"My 8 month old son LOVES this toy. However, while playing with the star shaped 'carrot' he managed to get the 'leaves' stuck in his mouth. It took a little gentle tugging to get it out. Fortunately, my son was unharmed, but the indicident certainly scared us BOTH!! My husand has since cut the 'leaves' off all the veggies."
4,"important information in here, anoying way to deliver it","Used the book in Organizational Theory. It is an easy ready, lots of pictures and charts, very interesting information contained within, however delivery can be anoying. The executive's voice is always talking to himself and appears to never have done anything right. its audience is for people who know what MBO and TQM stand for, however even if you dont its got great information contained within. 200 or so pages, very easy read ."
1,Useless,"A 32Mb card is completely useless. It won't hold even one game. This one was bought by accident in a rush, thinking it was a 32Gb for this price. The seller also stated it was new, yet it came without packaging and was clearly used. I'm just out $20, since it isn't worth the hassle to return.*Edit- Seller called me repeatedly BEGGING me to change the rating I gave him from neutral to positive, saying Amazon would close his store because of it. He also promised me a refund, but the check never showed up. He claimed to be a disabled 80 year old man, I'm sure that's a load of crap too. Take my advice and don't buy anything from this guy."
1,Wow!!!! WAY overpriced!!!,How the heck can they ask $40+ for this? 32 megs is tiny!!! One demo on PSN EASILY exceeds 32 megs. This is a total ripoff.
1,don't throw 20 bucks down the drain!?!,"Why would you sell this item in the store if it already comes in the value pack? That does not make common sense. This card holds up to 8 songs and 4 games. That's it? The 512mb will go down to $70 by Christmas and the 1gb will go down to $100. If you have a PSP and are a music, game, video, and photo lover, put a memory stick on your list to santa."
1,Useless,Its completely useless do to its low Memory.. make sure you read the whole title before you buy. its 32mb's not 32gb
3,yes and no,for simple camrias 32 megs is a fine thing the card worked well but did not have the space that i could have used i found out that 8 gigs is the max a psp can cope with with out mods witch i will not use and they only reccomend 4good item just not enoughft memory spaceto down load and store full games and incorectly processed music files
3,Did not receive package as soon as I had hoped,"The memory card was fine, however I had to wait a little longer than expected, it was a gift for my son & the seller emailed me a week & 1/2 after the order was shipped to say he had been on vacation & the package had been returned because he had not put enough postage on it?? But the product was fine once I finally got it."
1,It's a lie....,"The pic shows it's 32 MBs, but the product I got in the mail was only 1 MB Memory stick. I called the company that sent it to me, and they said it was an error on Amazon's part."
3,OK,"THIS IS AN OK CARD IT WORKS GREAT ON GAMES,PICTURES,AND ANY OTHER WEAK CRAP YOU WANT TO PUT ON THERE BUT MUSIC IT HOLDS 4 OR 5 IF YOUR LUCKY 6 SONGS I MEAN IT TAKES UP ALOT OF SPACE I DELETED ALL OF MY GAME INFO AND IT DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME ENOUGH SPACE TO PUT ONE MORE SONG BUT AFTER ALL IT DOES WORK RIGHT?"
1,Suckage...,"Honestly, I can say I do not have this product but people, ask your self; am I gonna buy more than 5 games and download more than 100 of my fave mp3 songs? If they are both yes, at the least you need 256MB (Id get giga pack personally). Then ask yourself; am I one of those people who are single task people with 2 games and 15 songs? if yes this is for you. but for $50 more, you can get a 512MB. If you havent gotten a PSP yet, and your goin to download lots of stuff. Just get Giga Pack. The giga Pack is the smartest friggen thing they have had yet."
2,"Great to have, but not enough memory","This is a great item to come with the system but is one of the first thinkgs you need to buy in addition to your first game. The 32MB of space is fine for saving game files and putting a couple of songs on your psp. But if your like me and want to use the psp's video functionality then you will need to get a bigger memory stick. I hae about 5 game saves, 6 songs and i could only fit 30 seconds of video on my psp."
1,Seriously?,This is a good way to toss money away. First of all the movies in the deck are not forgotten in the least. Many get regular play on cable. And some of the choices are awful. Earth Girls are Easy was never a terrific film. Including Invasion of the Body Snatchers? That movie still towers among the great sci-fi classics and is very well known. The info on the back of these cards is weak and you can learn more on almost any website.This is a very poor product and you can't even play cards with them.The Good Captain
3,"Not great, but not bad either...","I can't say that I did not enjoy the book. For a debut effort, it is a decent piece of work. The pacing is good, the plot twists are nice, the characters are likeable. And yet it seems like the book was written by a very eloquent high school overachiever, not a woman with a law degree. Something seems amiss. I am, nevertheless, looking forward to reading the rest of Meg's books."
2,Not a believeable Plot,"I had just finished reading Dirty Secrets Club which was quite well done and reached back to read China Lake, which had been highly praised. It's a plodding read, has a not very believeable plot and a heroine who has a big "" Kick me"" tattoo across her forehead for all of the foolish escapades she engages in. I would have expected someone with a little more appreciation for consequences given that she is a lawyer by training."
4,It made *my* heart pound...,"If you love suspense, you need to go out immediately and find a book by Meg Gardiner. Meg, you've been hidden in the UK for too long! I really enjoyed The Dirty Secrets Club, but this one was even better. At one point, Evan's sister-in-law tries to illegally take back custody of her son while Evan is locked in the back of a police car, and I thought I was going to literally jump out of my seat! And that was just the beginning! This story of a cult gone crazy really makes you think about what we as a society can control, and what we can't, especially as Evan tries to get help from the police, who don't know whom to believe. And I never expected the final twist. I think I especially liked the quiet times in the story, where you got a real sense of Evan, Jesse, and Luke's normal lives. So often you only see the characters in a suspense novel in the midst of chaos. I will definitely be reading (or listening to) more of these, likely sooner rather than later."
2,Some of the worst writing I've ever suffered through.,"I gave this book 2 stars because as an idea, China Lake wasn't THAT bad. Nor did I mind the silly plot or characters - it was the writing itself that killed this book for me. As a few other reviewers have previously stated, this book contains some of the worst metaphors and clichés ever printed on paper. If anything, this book will give aspiring authors faith that they can probably write much better than Meg Gardiner. If you like amateurish, unchallenging prose - then this is your book. A beach book to be left in the sand indeed."
5,Pulp fiction for the 21st century,"I'm not surprised that although this has a number of five star reviews, it also has a fair number of one star reviews. This style of writing isn't for everyone and I'm going to try to indicate whether the individual ""you"" reading this will like it or not.I grew up on the pulp fiction of the 40's, published on cheap paper in magazines with unbelievably garish covers. These were overwritten stories that produced a visceral effect on the readers.The stories were taut, fast paced, and also preposterous and unbelievable. And I with many others loved it.If you're not willing to park your brain somewhere while you read this, you won't like it. This is for those who enjoy admittedly trasy fiction which is skillfully handled as this is. Suspension of disbelief is required for this, but if you're willing to just relax and be taken on a roller coaster ride, this is the book for you."
1,A real beach book,"This mystery is a real summer beach book. It is meant to be taken to the beach and left on the sand. Maybe some surfer will use to light a fire.Actually, it is a bit of a hoot at times. The author liberally uses adjectives to the point of gluttony. Women have ""masses of toffee-colored hair"" Men sport ""tousled ebony curls.""All the women are cooly professional meddlers except for the fat, sweaty, brain-dead females of the congregation, while the men are either defense lawyers with noble goals, strong in their disabilities or heroic fighter pilots with piercing blue eyes and sea-burnished skin. Unless, of course, they are the evil fundamentalist groupies who have pustulent skin, greasy hair and braying voices.Maybe the author should stick with ""bodice-rippers"" and leave serious thriller writing to the professionals who can actually draw characters."
1,Cheap-O Radar Detector,"I bought this Radar Detector a while ago, the suction cups are very bad at holding it up, it's a very weak and cheap detector. Definately not good enough to provide accurate detection, I'd definately not recommend this product."
4,Baby loves this toy!,"I bought this when my daughter was 7 months old, and she was immediately fascinated. At 9 1/2 months, she still loves it! My only concern is that it is a fairly heavy toy overall and the tambourine is quite heavy and hard. She has never hit herself or anyone else with the toy or its detachable instruments, but I do watch her closely because of this concern. Overall, I think this is a great toy; fun and musical but not too loud or annoying."
3,"Not so easy for young children, and not the best out there","Disappointed with this one. It's a hybrid of sorts: it tries to be a song maker, a piano, and a stacker all in one. Unfortunately for small children, it's too bulky to really stack, and the drum and tambourine are too difficult to remove. The piano plays pre-set songs, or tracks of songs, rather than notes, so children have to listen thru before they engage again. Would have preferred individual sounds as (at least) an option. Because of the way the sound settings work, and the ease in which the cymbal can activate, ours essentially plays one song over and over again. We were definitely hoping for more, although it's not without its charms at times."
5,"great musical, interactive toy","my daughter loves music so I got her this toy. It really helped her as she was learning to sit up at 5/6 months because she could hold on to it while she chewed the toy. She loved the lights and the fun music and now at 8 months loves taking it apart and chewing on the instruments and shaking the tamborine and drum. The music is nice too, not your typical annoying baby songs, though she loves the symbol, so we hear ""John Jacob Jinglehimerschidt"" alot. It's a very cute toy and one her daddy and I enjoy with her."
3,Dance Baby Dance Building Band,"My in-laws bought this toy as a XMas gift for our 9 month old daughter. While my daughter loves the music, we quickly became concerned with it from a safety perspective. After about 2 weeks of use, the toy shorted out. We could smell a funny smoke odor coming from the base near the battery compartment, and the toy would no longer play music (it just whined and sounded like an old cassette tape stuck in a player. While the drum and tambourine are still functional for her to play with, they are heavy for a child's toy, and can cause bumps and bruises unless you are VERY CAREFULLY watching your child."
3,Broken before we had it 2 mos?!,"Bought this for my 4 mo. old son for Christmas (got it for a great price at Costco). He played with it a lot - loved it. His dad & I thought it was a wonderful toy, until it shorted out with no provocation after only about 1.5 months of use. We've tried to find a replacement, but seems it's not for sale anymore. We are very disappointed and plan to return for a refund at Costco."
4,More to Kansas than Dorothy and Toto,"Written for middle school students, this history is spiced with tales, photos and sidebars seldom seen in history books. My daughter loved the book because these characters match her fictional favorites for fortitude and impact. ""Hey, Mom, listen to this..."" Apparent exhaustive research, unusual photos, strong creativity. The story-telling charm is off-set, however, by misspelled words, omission of prehistoric eras, and rewrite of characters who are not socially mainstream or exemplary. Kansas was more diverse and colorful than this book portrays. Was truth thinned to assure that the book would ""sell"" to schools? History is meant to be rich. It is about life, itself."
2,No Thank You,"Skates has brought new information to bear on the invasion plans. That is my only reason for giving this book any stars at all.Here are some of my reservations about his Monday morning quarterbacking:1. Choosing the best way out of the situation may have been logical for the Japanese but it did not fit their mind-set at the time.2. Despite the feelers put out by some leaders, the country was still in the firm hands of the warriors who had no intention of surrendering.3. Suppose we do rewrite history and carry out the invasion. Given Skates' best case, we would still have lost many soldiers' and sailors' lives as well as many more lives of admittedly poorly prepared Japanese defenders. No thank you."
1,LOW-FI RECORDING,"I was looking for an instrumental album of early to middle 20th century music to sing-a-long with, [and party to] on New year's eve when I came across this CD at Amazon. I know it is a cheap CD but I did not expect it to be such low fidelity. The worst part is that it is a live recording with a bunch of folks singing that are not good singers and can't seem to stay in key. This is not something I will ever play at a party or anywhere else. I regret that I was unable to sample the album before I purchased it, as I would never have bought this CD otherwise. To my ear it sounds awful with cacophonous crowd noise, off key singing and low-fi music."
3,ok,"While these can be useful to protect my dog's feet from the freezing cold in the winter when I'm trying to walk him... problem is, they don't stay on, no matter what I do. They come flying off even though my dog is just only walking."
4,Excellent primer on pastoral care,"Sarah A. Butler's book is an excellent primer on pastoral care for those who are entering a caring ministry either on a professional or lay level. The sections on ""Listening"" and ""Focus on Feelings"" are good basic stuff, but absent in most introductory pastoral care books. I am making this book mandatory reading for basic Clinical Pastoral Education students and it should be mandatory for any lay ministry training. Experienced parish pastors and chaplains will find it a good review that provides needed ""capatability checking"" for their own pastoral ministry. The ""Spiritual Application"" sections at the end of each chapter are thought-provoking and pedagogical."
5,Voices in Standards,"This recording did not disappoint me, it was terrific, the choice of songs was excellent! it literally made my heart jump!"
1,Extremely Cheesy,The best thing about this CD is The Lew Anderson Big Band. They are very tight. The trumpet players are burnin. The New Four Freshman actually ruin the CD. They sing out of tune at times and sound more like Kareoke singers. It would have been much better without them. Big disappointment. If you want to hear some great Four Freshman check out the real Four Freshman With Saxes.
5,Sick Beats,"Virus Syndicate is an awesome group. Anyone that like rap, dubstep and club hits should check them out. Awesome grime group. Their videos are pretty sick too."
1,Hideous,"It sounded like a good idea, but 95% of this book is hideous. I don't get the point of buying silk ribbon to cut it up and knot it all over a sweater. Especially when said sweater is already made of some over the top fluffy dangly yarn.I'm sorry I wasted my cash. There's nothing in there that inspires me. how sad is that?"
5,"Fabulous, exciting!!","What an inspiration this book is for a beginning knitter. I am very structured and conventional in everything I do, yet KNITOVATON has shown me the way to knit without fear. The designs are exquisite and best of all I can follow the instructions without problems. I have already finished making ""Gelato"" and can hardly wait to start something else. So much fun!!!!! I look forward to KNITOVATION Book 2."
1,Not worth the money,Get this book from a library before you buy it. I'm glad I did. Saved money better spent on more yarn.
1,AND VOGUE EDITOR PICKED THIS!,Boring. That is the best review this can be given. The editor at Vogue could not even have looked inside this book! Don't waste your money.
3,trendy,"Knitovation is based upon a very intriguing design idea - putting together basic squares and rectangles, in different sizes, to make various garments. This book contains more than 25 patterns, designed in just that way. With only a few exceptions, however, the garments are somewhat boxy (well, what else can be expected from squares and rectangles?), and attempts to compensate for or hide that defect are made with heavy use of glitzy, fuzzy, fancy novelty yarns. The photos are good, as are the instructions and diagrams, but there simply isn't enough here that I'd like to knit."
4,"Good Concepts, Poor Yarn Choices","I liked this book for the project ideas. Knitting basic rectangles and squares and joining them in creative ways to come up with usable wearables has a lot of appeal. The recommendation in the beginning of the book is a must: make paper models of the shapes and fold them as directed in the pattern to figure out what to do with the knit pieces. I wish there were diagrams with each pattern showing the assembly process. As others have said, the yarn choices are bizarre. In some cases, they hide what the garmet is, making it hard to decide if this is something I would want to try to make. Some projects seem a waste of paper and ink -- who would really knit six squares to sew together into a cube? I will definitely use some of the patterns, but will substitute my own yarn choices."
1,Sad book,"I really disliked this book, the designs are repetitious and not inspiring at all. Comparing this to Loop-d-Loop, which I loved, just shows how far from gorgeous, creative or amazing a set of designs can get.I am so glad that Amazon will take stuff back"
5,I'm Deaf and it's okay,"I bought this book for our son's pre-k teacher to share with the class. It was also used for his kindergarten class. It's the only book like it's kind that I know of out there that can help explain so much to others about what a deaf child is going through. How they feel and what the ""outside"" world is like for them. Covers alot of the angers and frustrations and fears that deaf children face on a daily basis. I highly recommend this book for ANY parent of a deaf or hearing impaired child to get this. If not for your child and others but also for yourselves to help understand and open up a bit of understanding. My son went through EVERYTHING that the little boy in this book went through and it let others know that ""hey this is normal"". Don't hesitate to add this to your library today!"
1,dosn't work,"I have seen this short film before and loved it, however i can not get this to work on my computer or any other play back device like dvd player or game concole."
3,"VCD, not DVD!",This VCD might not play in some DVD players. It was manufactured and distributed in Asia for use with their technology. This is not stated in the description.
3,Short film fell short,"The only reason I gave this product a 3 out of 5 is because compared to ""Thriller"" this elaborate short film did not surpass it. It had potential. It had Michael Jackson. It had great special effects. It had great costumes. Yet the script lacked substance and the dance sequence did not flow with the dialogue. Actually, everything seemed cut and paste, with no real connection. The extra ghost dancers, they just seemed cluttered. When I was watching the film, I kept on thinking, ""I wish there was less special effects."" Sometimes seeing the ""real"" thing is more classic and beautiful. Michael Jackson is a great dancer, and seeing ""This is It"" is much nicer than seeing ""Ghost"" simply because there was no special effects added to great live dancing. Yet, I do recommend for MJ fans to see it. I also think it would be great for Halloween parties, etc. Its still a fun film, just not a ""masterpiece""."
1,I got a bootleg copy when it was suppose to be new,"I bought what I thought was a new copy of Michael Jackson's ""Ghosts""When I received it July 16, 2009 I was so excited. Excited that is until I found out that it will only play in my computer. We tried it in our dvd player, xbox360, and playstation 3. All we got was ""No Disc"". I know I will never get my money back, I'll just take this as a loss. I buy alot of things from Amazon and I am disappointed and seriously hurt by this matter."
2,Was not able to watch it.,Disappointed I was not able to watch it. It would not play in any of the DVD players or in my computer.
4,mj,I don't know why I waited sooo long to purchase this dvd. It was great and I plan to watch it over and over like I have with everything about MJ. The film was a little grainy but still worth it.
1,Skipped terribly,"I tried to watch this video multiple times, but it skipped/stuttered throughout the film. It was agonizing. Contacted the seller multiple times and never heard back. Now it's unavailable. Hmpf."
1,not happy,"I ordered the video and it wouldnt play in anything, not even my PC. Was never told about the difference in the videos. I cannot aford to go out and buy another player, just to see this video. Was told it could be copied on to a regular dvd disk and then I could view it. Well I had 2 copies made onto reg. disks and they still wont play in anything. So Im not very happy."
2,michael jackson's ghosts dvd,"I tried this dvd in our computer when I got it and it worked fine and then I tried to play it in our dvd player and it won't play, when buying a dvd make sure it is from a store and new I bought it used, it is my mistake and one that I will not make again."
5,Ghosts,"Michael Jackson's ""Ghosts"" is one of the most ingenious and imaginative videos ever produced. It is a classic for Halloween. He was such a talent and will be missed."
5,Michael is the best.,"I love this video. It has everything you love about Michael, plus some surprises."
5,I love Ghost,"I had received my vcd tape of ghost, who cares that you can only play it in your computer, the point is this is michael jackson performing 3 roles, and the best dance moves you will see, great story. I played it now probably 20 times, I love the song, infact I downloaded it off Itunes, 2bad. He is so cute in this movie and I could imagine he had fun making it, especially working with steven king. Great buy. You will love it. Michael jackson is the best, and this is truly a good story line."
1,Wishing for bluray...,No rating for me. Product is okay for what it is but I just wish they produce this in bluray format like Moonwalker/This is it. I actually wish they will enhanced and make blurays of his previous videos. For me VCD is soooo yesterday.
5,"I love this Toy, is so cute and fun","I bought this toy for my nephew. Unlike all the other reviews, i have no issues with this toy. I was testing it on hardwood floors and carpet floors and it rolls just fine. And the popcorn pops like its supposed to. It might not pop as fast as a regular popper does but it has bigger wheels that have to spin. And ive had no issues with the handle either. All in all i feel this is a good toy and i cant wait to see my nephews face when he gets it."
3,Disappointed,"This is a very cute toy. However, the head of the combine doesn't turn very easily and so the corn doesn't pop much. The biggest disappointment is the handle. Why would you make such a cute toy and put a flimsy, junky handle on it? The child gets frustrated with it and doesn't play with it much. It should have had a sturdy handle like the toy lawnmowers have so children can push it more easily."
1,No POP at all,"This item is very cute if you just want to look at it. The wheels were very hard to turn on both carpet and hardwood surface (for an adult), and even when they did turn, the corn did not pop. We were very disappointed with this purchase, and returned it for a full refund."
3,Decent Toy,"I bought this for our 1 year old son for his birthday and he likes it ok. I really like the John Deere design of it and the popping noise is perfect - enough fun for our son but not so loud that it bothers us. It works really well and it is also very durable. My son carries it around sometimes, rather than pushing it, and it has been thrown, jumped on, laid on, etc. The only thing I would change about this toy is the overall height of it. Our son is about 31"" and it seems a little short for him. I would recommend this overall, though."
1,TOTAL waste of money!!,"This looked so adorable and perfect, but it must have been tested by Paul Bunyun because no normal baby could exert the amount of pressure needed to make this toy function. When pushed, the wheels simply skid motionless along the floor and no ""popcorn"" is popped. Even my older kids found it depressing and nobody played with it. It's sitting upstairs in my attic. Even the mice find it boring."
1,Very unappealing,"In reading customer reviews after I bought this, I was intrigued with the review that referred to the book as showing ""interior design as art."" Aha! Now I know why I found this book so unappealing. The book doesn't seem to be about decorating real homes for real life and real comfort. The book comes off as one author's idea of how to impress other people. These ""settings"" (I can't honestly call them homes because they are so chilly and phony looking) may work as backdrops for a cocktail party, but I keep wondering as I look at these pictures where the people who have to live in them actually go when they want to relax after the party's over. A dreary and depressing book because the settings look like rooms from Yuppiedom of the 1980s. Ick."
1,Useless,"I am giving this book only one star because I expected more from Bilhuber. The photos are fuzzy and the text is so vague that it cannot possibly help the reader in search of practical solutions. There are only a few hints or guidelines and I did not appreciate the broad generalizations. To make matters worse, there wasn't a single picture in this book which impressed or inspired me.It's not even a nice coffee table book since the photographic quality is so poor. A HUGE waste of money!"
1,Boring,"This turned out to be a boring book which the author filled with photographs of rooms reflecting surprisingly similar decorating approaches. I don't know this particular author, but if Mr. Billhuber writes another book, I recommend that he bring in photographs of room styles that are more varied than these. I think this could have been ""editted"" down to one story in a magazine instead of being stretched into a book. I lost interest in these rooms very quickly."
5,j'adore this book!!!,"Jeffrey has a unique way of explaining something so simply and the results are spectacular! I just moved to a new apartment and am already filled with many ideas for what to do with it, can't wait to get started. Bravo Bilhuber! I'm a believer."
2,Long on style but short on reality,"This book did not live up to its promise. It's long on style but short on reality. Style in this case isn't such a good thing because what this author's sense of style conveys is design for design's sake instead of design for the sake of life. I find that more than a little sad. Perhaps this look play s in New York where image sometimes is m ore important than substance and where showiness counts, but it doesn't feel like a good fit west of the Hudson."
1,A little cold and unreal looking,I was disappointed because the rooms are a little cold and unreal looking. They look more like the kinds of overdone or over-planned rooms you see when you walk through show houses than rooms my friends or I would want to live in. I don't know the author but I liked the book's title. Unfortunately the book didn't live up to its promise.
4,Solid Information on Design Techniques,"For those of you seeking pretty pictures and how to copy the rooms, look in a different book or a magazine. The pictures are only incidental to the information inside. Instead, you will find out how this designer thinks so you can begin to see solutions and develop your own ideas. This is not a ""step 1, step 2, etc."" book, you will have to think and apply principles yourself."
3,Unexciting considering the credentials of all involved.,"Rizzoli is known for some of the most delectible art and coffee table books on the market, so I'm surprised at how grainy many of the photos are in this book. Maybe they did it to mask how unremarkable some of the rooms are. I'm sure these highly textured rooms fare much better in person than they do on the printed page. Bilhuber isn't the greatest writer in the world (he occasionally sounds like Auntie Mame), but I actually found some of what he discusses fairly inspiring. Also, he had the good sense to include Benjamin Moore paint numbers for his favorite paints (including a nice selection of whites...and judging from what I usually overhear in the paint store, people have trouble picking out the correct white for their home). I wish more design books included such useful info."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"These USED to be great. Just ordered a replacement for one i purchased one to two years ago and the difference in quality is incredible. The new one was very thin and cheaply made. I phoned Chattanooga to see if perhaps I mis-ordered. The story I got was that due to the war, they had to use a cheaper quality canvas and since the canvas was flimsy, they had to use less filler. Sounded like a story to me in a fantastic attempt to substitute inferior quality and cut costs but retain the price of their product. Play the patriotism card and no one will complain! Two red, white and blue thumbs down Chattanooga!"
5,great value and price!,"We are so pleased with the hot packs we ordered! Same quality product we have been ordering through a therapy supply place, but we got thru Amazon for less...and free shipping! GREAT!!!"
5,Works for me,I was beginning to have daily chest pain and was becoming a bit concerned. . This was going on for a month or so. I began taking this and the chest pains went away in about 4 days. They rarely return and never as bad as they were. There are no side effects with this to my experience and I'm very sensitive to such things.
2,Arjuna Extract Review,It is difficult to know how this herb is working because it is supposed to be beneficial to the heart. I am taking only on the advice of a physician.
1,Norton Messed Up Bad!,"I bought the 3-user license of the Norton Internet Security. On my PC's and even my new Dell laptop it just refused to work: 1) It slowed down the PC's tremendously 2) e-mails would seem to be sending out as they found their way to the ""sent"" folder....but they were never really sent out 3)have been trying to work with it for over a month with technical experts trying to solve the problems without success and finally bought their competitor's software which works fine. 4) I am too late to get my money back from Norton. No more Symantec things for me, they stole my money as far as I am concerned."
1,Norton Internet Security 2005,"TERIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. My life is too short to deal with this c$#p! I only wish I had read the reviews before I bought this junkie software. I also was a loyal Norton customer. I remember using Norton utilities in the good-old days of DOS and I never had any problems. Unfortunately, I suspect that Mr. Norton has long ago sold out to Symantec and he's on a beach somewhere. Now we have to deal with a faceless, heartless (and money grubbing) corporation. The anti-spam feature works intermittently and unreliably. Further, customer support is a JOKE. Here's the lesson I've learned: Before buying any important software or hardware, check the internet for user reviews! Ignore the ""editor"" reviews since that's nothing more than corporate hype.PS. If you look at the customer reviews in this section, see if you can find the one that sounds like a corporate ad. I'll bet that guy works for Symantec. ;-)"
2,Great difficulty with Intrusion detection,"There is a great deal of difficulty with installation errors especially with the Intrusion detection feature. Many of the home customers that I support are not sophisticated enough to go through the knowledge base solutions in order to fix these ""permissions"" problems. Also, sometimes they don't even work. I have to install and reinstall the software several times without success.This is the first time in 14 years of using Norton products that I have had these problems. I am seriously considering switching to Zone Alarm Pro Security Suite."
2,Slows the system down!,"I am not a fan of virus protection applications in general because of the overhead it puts on the system making them slower. Immediately after installation of the Norton anti-virus application my computers were measurably slower and performance continued to deteriorate. As I replaced each computer I opted to use the products available directly from Microsoft. The Microsoft anti-virus apps do not tax the system like Norton or others that I have used and I applaud them for making their products available. I would not recommend a third party anti-virus product when Microsoft offers a ""Best-in-Class"" solution."
5,Strummin,"As always with Augustine products, these classical strings are of great quality and very reasonably priced. Saving a small amount of cash on cheaper strings just isn't worth it when you hear the quality you get from these. But spending 5 times the price for some of the other clasical strings just makes no sense either - these strings get superb qulaity, that is the main one. The fact they come at a great price too is a bonus."
2,A and D strings don't last!,"I used to use Augustine's regularly but I had some quality control problems with their strings. Also, they're just cut long enough barely for a 660mm fretboard. One other thing is that they don't last as well as Pro-Arte's...especially the A and D. The Red's play easily but don't sound as nice as the harder Blacks, which are really a pretty good sounding string...just wish they could fix the other problems! Using D'Addario composites now which sound great and last much much longer."
3,Eyeglass/contact lens case,"It's a nice size, but the glasses case isn't sturdy enough to be much protection. Even canvas would have been better."
4,Very versatile,"I travel every 3 weeks to Europe, and this is a great way for me to keep my glasses and contacts together when I travel. I can take my contacts out, and put my glasses on during long flights. The soft case provides the right amount of protection, and it doesn't take up a ton of room. Highly recommended, great price and great design."
3,"It's nice to have everything together, however....","I like the idea of everything being in one case. The bottle for solution and rewetting drops is also very cool on the contact side. What I don't like is how flimsy the eyeglass side is. I wish it was a little more sturdy to protect my glasses, like a leather case.... it's a great idea and I'll use it until I find one like it available in leather."
3,A fascinating character,"This is the story of Joseph Duveen, the man responsible for building the most famous private collections (later museums) in the U.S. As a dealer, he was the first to fully understand that art travels where money lives, which is to say from Europe to America.There are many lively anecdotes recalling his relationship with Morgan, Mellon, Altman, Widener and, most of all, the diabolical Berenson (thanks to new material that surfaced recently, the confidential contract between the expert and the dealer is very well described in the book). It is true that this book is not entirely satisfactory because it is somewhat confuse and too anecdotical, but the main character is so fascinating that it still makes for good reading."
2,A Disorganized Spiral of Facts and Anecdotes,"I completely agree with the other reviews who found this biography a disappointment. With the author's background in biographies of other art-related individuals and the ability to review the Duveen archives, it is quite surprising that this book is so disorganized and ultimately uninformative. While there is a overall chronology to the chapters, within each it's a spiral back and forth between times and events. Also the author never really presents thoughtful analyses of key questions for anyone who would wish to read about Duveen or Berenson based upon her extensive investigation of the lives of both individuals. While there are numerous anecdotes and brief comments by contemporaries, one really ends with no understanding of how history should view either man."
4,Strength and Weakness,"Strength:1)Introduces Thermodynamic in a understandable manner2)All homework problems are engineering-related, allowing better grasp of knowledge3)Helpful example problems with great illustrations and step-by-step explanation4)There's a chapter summary of equations and conception throughout the book. This is great for test preparation.5)Vivid analogies to convey abstract concepts such as entrophy, enthalpy, and exergy.Weakness:1)The book mainly covers Classical rather than statistical thermodynamics, which mean students in chem, physics, and chem engineering will not be fully prepared for future courses in thermodynamicsOverall, this is very good way to start thermodynamics, especially if this is the first time encountering thermo. However, if to continue to take more thermo, this book focuses main on engineering rather than other disciplines."
4,Introductory thermodynamics,Its a very nice book on thermodynamics for beginners. Its not extensive but covers the basics with some applications which is required for any fresher course.
2,Drastically Different from 6th ed.,"I bought this book for a class that required the 6th edition, thinking that the problems would be different but the layout would be the same. Not so much. The layout is completely different; one chapter in this edition has been broken into two by the sixth. As a result, this book was completely useless to me."
4,Good intro to engineering thermodynamics,"I have used this textbook for my engineering thermodynamics class and have found it to be a very interesting and straightforward text. Cengel and Boles begin with the basics and build up to more advanced topics. The problems in this text are challenging and reinforce concepts learned in previous chapters. Answers are included with some of the problems so that you can compare your answers when you finish. Examples are numerous and generally very helpful. However, this text has its drawbacks. The notation in the examples can be confusing and sometimes don't make mathematical sense. In addition, Cengel and Boles have a number of mistakes in the answers they provide. Despite these detractors, I definitely recommend this text for anyone wanting a solid introduction to engineering thermodynamics."
4,Good Book,I don't usually write reviews of books that I have purchased but I felt that I had to for this one. Does a great job in explaining the concepts and doesn't leave you lost as it moves through the chapters. It is written clearly and easy to follow. You can E-mail me @ ohnopk@hotmail.com if you need to buy a solutions CD. See my other reviews for more solutions CD's. Great Text
2,Incomplete,The solution manual was incomplete. Manual only contained about 1/3 of solutions for each chapter.
2,Ordinary,"Book is fine for looking at and talking about pictures with your little one. Nothing new here. Sound quality of recorder is poor and get's in the way. Only good thing about the recorder is the hole in the middle of the pages is fun to look through. My son likes that he recognizes children and images from the video in the book, but we have other picture books that are much better and images much clearer to identify. Not a bad book, just don't expect too much. Ordinary picture book."
3,The dvd is great!,"My 16 month old daughter is not too interested in this book, but she absolutely adores the dvd. She watches it atleast 2 times a day and she talks about what the dvd shows all through the day. It helps a lot with learning the sounds of the alphabet, animals, and just watching other children interact with one another."
2,Purchased book for 16 month old,The pictures in this book are nice but the recording device is terrible. I liked the concept of the book but it did not live up to my expectations.
3,Great music - boring videos,"This is the videos from the first albums after the 1985 reunion. If you are a fan, you would like to see the band now and then in the videos - this is not happening often here. Some of the music is great, especially ""Perfect Strangers"". ""Call of the Wild"" has a nutty video."
2,"Good listening, Terrible talking","I got this headset to use with Skype. While they make a good set of headphones, the mic is next to useless. You virtually have to scream into the mic in order to be heard. Given the fact that the mic is what distinguishes this product from a headset, you would think that the mic would work properly. Unfortunately, I didn't learn this fact until after the return period ended, otherwise, these would have gone back to the seller.If you want something that you can use for talking, find something else. These are terrible."
3,Almost a great book,"Smart, well written material with three dimensional characters place this book head and shoulders above most fictional fare. So it is regretable that Kay ended the story so quickly, and with so little of the care that made the first three quaters so very good. I can only assume that the editors had their way over Kay's objections, the publishers were concerned with paper costs, or Kay got bored with the process.Still, Kay's ability to weave a story makes me eager to sample his other writings, if only to determine if ""Lions"" was a fluke, or if Kay really is one of the best writers available."
5,Classic Kay. A near perfect novel to immerse yourself in.,"Once again, Guy Gavriel Kay fashions a world similar toour own, weaving history and fantasy into an unforgettabletapestry of strong men and women in time of holy war.Conflicts between duty and the heart are given bittersweetvoice in a setting reminiscent of Moorish Spain. Palaces,walled cities, murder and betrayal provide the backdrop foran unforgettable climax, which will result in a life takenand a culture transformend."
3,Too realistic for fantasy too fantastic for a historic novel,Although the style and storytelling of Kay meet his usual high standards this book had one major flaw in my opinion. For those with knowledge of medieval Europe it is playing in spain during the reconquistada and the major character looks a lot like El Cid. Kay's work has been based on medieval episodes and places in Europe for a while(Tigana - Italy; A song for Arbonne - southern France) but not before did he come this close to real events. With the amount of research into the events Kay should either write a 'real' historic novel in which at least major events and important persons have their own name or he should get away from reality and write once more 'real' fantasy.
4,I like this author,"I've read a number of Mr Kay's books and have enjoyed them all.They seem to be part mystery, part fantasy and part action adventure with a healthy dose of emotion.All of this is tied to very well developed characters that the reader can either like or dislike, but always understand.Give him a try."
5,This book is simply brilliant.,"I am not a man to cry easily, but this man had me sniffling in a crowded train. This novel is, in a word, brilliant. G.G. Kay has the ability to create vivid characters, witty dialogue, and very emotional prose. I rank novels according to the Alexlit scale. I've given the ""fabulous"" rating to only a few novels - they can be counted on the fingers of a maimed hand. But ""The Lions of Al-Rassan"" is one of those novels. Read it."
5,Spoiled Me,"I have to agree with another reviewer, Kay's novels have spoiled me and made me less tolerant for things I would have read before. His style is hauntingly lyrical, his stories heartbreaking. I can honestly say he is one of those writers whose work causes me to come away changed."
5,The Lions of al-Rassan,"""The Lions of al-Rassan"" is one of my favourite novels by Guy Gavriel Kay. It is well written, like all his work, although perhaps not as densely written as ""Tigana"" or ""A Song for Arbonne"". Although technically falling in the fantasy genre, the worlds of these novels are very strongly modelled on the cultures of medieval (?) europe. In the case of ""The Lions of al-Rassan"" it is modelled on the clash between the Islamic and Christian cultures in Medieval Spain. The book is a great, well-paced read, with very character-driven plot. I now have two copies at home, so I have one to read, and one to lend to friends."
5,A work to treasure all your life . . .,"You do not have to be a fantasy loyalist to fall hard for this one, only someone who appreciates fine writing and heart-catching storytelling. I own all of Kay's books, and dearly love his FIONAVAR TAPESTRY. But THE LIONS OF AL-RASSAN is something very special even so. Grand, romantic, funny, richly detailed, with characters you care deeply about and exquisite writing, this book is one to treasure for a lifetime! It achieves true tragic stature."
4,Historical Novel of a Medieval Spain That Might Have Been,"If you're at all familiar with Medieval Spanish history and the stories surrounding Spain's national hero, El Cid, then the basic plot of _The Lions of Al-Rassan_ won't come as any surprise. That said, in Guy Gavriel Kay's capable hands, you will still cry at the ending that you know is coming all along. The novel is set in an analog of a Medieval Spain that might have been, at a point when the three conflicting religious groups who share the peninsula are living in a fragile peace with each other. The story is told through the eyes of three main characters, one from each religion: a Jaddite (Christian) warrior, Rodrigo Belmonte, who is the El Cid character, an Asherite (Muslim) warrior, and the female Kindath (Jewish) physician who loves them both. Their personal lives are affected by events on a grand historical scale; you will be drawn into their escapades and dilemmas as the story marches to its inevitable conclusion."
4,Islanders from a historical perspective,"The video on this production is pretty good considering that most of the source material is 25 or so years old. The only criticism is that the feed used for most of the games is NOT the Islanders TV feed. I have my own copies of several of these games with announcing by the Islanders TV crew, including their post-game programming (1983 Islanders Game 4 vs. Oilers and the 1984 Isles vs. Rangers Game 5 among others). If I could have these, surely the producers of this set could have obtained them. Listening to CBC announcers or ESPN announcers is definitely not the same. That aside, it is an enjoyable group of games. Only the Isles vs. Maple Leafs 2002 game is questionable in its inclusion. Enjoy the days of hockey with no on ice, or on the boards advertising and some helmetless players!"
5,Buy Buy Buy,"I purchased this for my Islander fan husband and he loved it!This was well worth the price and since these are past games, you can give it as a gift for any occasion."
3,Let's Go Islanders,"The first few games are very poor quality film. It would have been nicer to have more ""glitz"" regarding the pre game and after game. The quality of film gets better eventually, but not until 2000Watching the Islanders is like traveling to the past and watching the greatest team to ever hit the ice. The Al Albour night game is fabulous and worth the price of the DVD."
4,Must for (Oldtime) Hockey-fans,"Great Hockey for good price. Video-quality is partly very poor, but highlyenjoyable stuff anyway. Lot of physical Hockey here... Bobby Nystrom is worth the price all alone!!!"
3,old days,Didn't like the first game had one of Nystrom's goals missing. The game against the Penquins during the Randy Carlyle days was hazy looking. But the bright side makes me want to see the entire Stanly Cup finals that the Islanders played.
4,Science Fiction as social commentary,"A nice try as a commentary on our society, the rich versus everybody else, but compromised in some areas. For a more compelling look at the human condition in the sci-fi format, try another sleeper, not yet on DVD(too new), ""District 9"". It makes the later ""Star Trek"" genre look as if it has nothing to say. The social commentary is superb."
5,"a dry, funny, bizzare, dark satire of wealthy society.","a bold use of incest in this dry, satire of an arrogant/wealthy society"
2,should have been better,I expected this to be a really good film but I found it rather dull and a bit stupid. The only thing that I liked was the gloopy scene at the end. If only the whole film had been as good as it's climax.
2,Not for everyone but decent effects,"I rented this movie while living in Japan several years ago and was struck by two things: interesting effects and I paid too much.The story focuses on a young man discovering a horrible secret about his family when they host a party of flesh melding, limb swapping madness for a bunch of mutants (or something like that) and then discovers his true purpose there.The story is weak, the acting is third-rate, but the effects of joined bodies and malleable flesh are not bad. I've seen worse excuses for a horror movie, but then I've also seen many better. This is a good example of a movie where the story is written to match special effects thought of in advance."
1,Can I give it a NEGATIVE amount of stars?!?,"This is on the top of my list of THE WORST movies of all time!!! It is so disgusting, weird, and pointless that I don't understand how it can even exist! Don't get me wrong, I fully enjoy and appreciate horror movies--I've lost count of how many I've seen and I'm not too picky--even rather terrible horror films I've seen (such as ""R.S.V.P."", ""Real Killers,"" or ""Slashers"") are infinitely better than this schlock. The movie is sort of ""normal"" at first, your typical bad horror movie cliche with poor acting and no plot, but then the main character discovers incest within his family which escalates somehow to a town-wide conspiracy/cult/group (which only he and a friend have managed to avoid) who all get together to... I don't even know what--have sex while eating each other?! or... something. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT waste an hour and a half of your life watching this piece of trash!!!"
4,I really liked this story...,"I greatly enjoyed reading this book, which kept me awake until 2 AM a few times while I was working on finishing it. Consumption tells the story of a dying culture whose ability to live ""on the land"" is slowly eroding into conformity with mainstream metropolitan America and Canada.The reason for the four-star review is due to some strange character development - while I appreciated Patterson's effort to weave an interesting story of many lives, there were some characters (Victoria's father and mother) that I wished were better-developed, while others (Amanda) that I could have done without."
2,"Lot of promise, and then it just drags on","Author has a remarkable talent for creating characters whom you think you might care about, but in the end... not so much. Author is an MD. I am an MD. His medical information is accurate, albeit depressing. Tuberculosis is a depressing disease. As its moniker suggests, it ""consumes"" everything it touches. If the author's intent is to create a novel that reflects this disease's processes, he succeeds. If it is to create a gripping story that you care about... not so much."
3,Life in the Arctic Wasteland,"This was a pretty good read, but Patterson has a tendency to digress in a bit of a wind-baggy way (he also exhibited this tendency in The Water in Between, but that was a much better book). The best parts concerned life on ""the land"" juxtaposed against encroaching modern life - excellent descriptions of dog-sledding, making igloos... I could have done without the heavy dose of medical information."
5,The Mackenzies : lily,I got the whole collection of The Mackenzies I didn't konow about this book until I look on her web sight .I'm glad I bought this book because it was good
2,It's a good thing that I bought it at a bargin bin.,"I pick up this book at very attractive price. I hope it can spice my sex life with my wife.The problem is that we both hate the male model in the book. He's a big turn off for both of us. I'm an even tmpered person. But when I see this male model, I want to punch him on the face. My wife doesnot like the other black female model either.If you like the models in the book, it may not be a bad one. Since it has pictures in every page, I cannot read it without irratated by the pictures."
2,The one up side.....,"The one good thing about this product is this. When the motor that spins the discs burned out, I was able to buy the identical product with a different problem off of ebay for $20 and replace the motor. So many people have a problem with this product that you can easily pick up an extra one for spare parts.....sad.I tried to just buy the motor, but Sony has some deal with the manufacturer so they won't sell this $2 motor to anyone but them."
1,You can't handle the truth,"My DVD no longer works.... Why? I thought it was the discs. I purchased brand new discs opened the package and placed directly in the unit without touching anything elese... Nothing happened. I have always loved SONY brand name. I just finished reading what others have written, I am having a hard time handling the truth... Unforetunately, I have to concur with others that this unit is NOT something to purchase. I hope that its current status of 'Unavailable' is because the people at SONY read these reviews as well...."
1,My advice?,"If there was one piece of advice I can offer the potential buyer of this product, it's this: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER.I've experienced all the issues named in all the reviews before me. I bought this player a while ago, about two years or so, and after minimal use, it has completely stopped working. It does not read any disk at all. It sounds like it's trying to read and play, but I just receive a small ""cannot read disk"" error on the LCD.It's a shame really. I really like the ability to have a multidisk player that couple play multiple formats. And I've always thought highly of Sony. Well, I certainly feel like the fool now. It's really surprising that all the user reviews on this product have the same thing to say, and have experienced the same problem."
4,Good straightforward background to housing,"Although a little dated, this book provides a good, straightforward, easy to read background on housing in America. It touches on the historical reasons why we prefer the single-family suburban house yet also explores other housing types and their origins."
2,disappointing,I was attracted to this book because of its title and description. I was looking for anecdotal descriptions of the evolution of housing... don't want to take the time to go back and remind myself why it was dissappointing but I quickly discarded it as not fullfilling my expectations from the title and description
5,Shadow Skill Anime Collection,This is a good anime collection. It was shipped on time andarrived in good condition.
2,Terrible on Amazon's part.,This book was well written and was hoping to add it to my collection. Upon recieving the book the print was so awful you can barely read it. I should have never and will never buy a book directly from Amazon again. Any other sight would be better.
4,Not Bad at All!,"Fun - Yeah, I'd make her dance.Educational -Pros - She encourages young girls to do ballet, or at least make SOMETHING of life instead of become just obsessed with fashion. And since Mattel doesn't provide too many accessories with her, young girls may create their own clothes for her - develop their creativity.Cons - Her body is totally unrealistic - ever read the tale of the girl who had plastic surgery to look like her?Durable - Yeah; her head doesn't pop off like THAT, her hair is easy to maintain, not falling out, and she doesn't come with so many accessories that get lost.Personally, I prefer it that her legs are pink. Then she doesn't lok so naked when you take her clothes of - she looks like she's wearing stockings."
3,No ballet poses,The arms do not bend so you cannot put the doll in real ballerina poses. My 4yr old granddaughter noticed this first but she still likes to play with it.
3,Very nice,I just ordered this for my three year old and found it at a great price on Amazon. So yes she does love it and I am very pleased with the purchase
3,WARNING!,"I wanted this toy and was about to get it when me and my mom found out that her legs are PANTED PINK!Can you belive it?If the legs were not pink,I would get it!"
1,Bad Facial Detail - Larger Than Normal Head,"This doll, like many of the newer Barbie's, has a head that is larger than it was a couple of years ago. The eyes have excessive painted lashes, which makes it look goofy. The upper lid has no ridge to add needed 3 dimensional details. To see better looking older dolls, do an internet vintage doll search; so that you can compare the head sculpt of the new and older versions. As mentioned in a previous review, the head sculpt and painted details have become steadily worse since the early 1980's. Newer, male dolls like Ken also have heads that are too big. Mattel should look back to 1977, and start over again from there. The head, face, and painted detail was much better indeed!"
3,Fun but unreal,This barbie is a very fun toy! but it owers my 3 yr old daughters self image. She thinks she has to be just like Barbie. When in realiy if Barbie was to be made into an actual human she would be unrealistic. It would not be my daughter with the problem...Poor children of this generation
5,World of Hurt,"I loved this book! I got so attached to some of the nurses and pilots. The last chapter was the best, I cried through the whole thing.This is one of those book that I will not sell or give away. I am sure I will read this again."
5,Mary Powell shows her nursing soul,"Read it in one night! Different tone of other Vietnam nursing books I have read. Shows us what she felt as she went and how the world was already treating the vets who were coming back. Mary seems to have remained true to her nursing while understanding the underhandedness of the political structure of the war. Appears to have psychologically been able to go on with her life in spite of what she had gone through. Again, I am sorry I was in junior and senior high during Vietnam, because I would have been there with her."
4,Fruits of the famine,Interesting book not as good as the others she has written but a good read. This book is set in the time of the deppression. It's kind of sad but as i said earlier still a good read.
5,A story that left me breathless !,"Bonjour, my dear Sister/Author,I am done with the book. To answer your comment on your ""signing"" I did not like your Story...I Lived It !!!!! I could not put it down..I read at work, the first evening I covered the first 83 pages. The 3rd night I totally fell in love (big time) with Benjamin Grayson...I still want to meet the guy ;-)... And I was going on guessing who was who.. and was right most of the time... you think and feel the same way I do..I read not with my eyes but my heart..Amanda's heart..The only thing that made me sad was that I discovered the book , like all the others had a......last page, I din't want it to end..And as I am writting this review for you, I want to go back, forget all that I read and start all over again...All in all, I was truly, fully transported by the characters. What a beautiful, heart tugging story!!! Thank You, my dear L.Katherine!!!!! What a trip you put me on, my heart is still dizzy....Love, Clémentine de Blanzat."
4,Things Hard to be Understood Provides Easy Answers,"David W. Cloud has done a masterful job on what will become a standard reference work among Fundamentalists--especially those with an affinity for the KJV. How refreshing to read a book which provides real answers rather than merely changing, adding, or deleting the words of Scripture! Cloud uses sound logic and solid primary sources when presenting his arguments. He is also honest enough to admit some difficult passages evade easy explanation, while defending the integrity of the text. I highly recommend this work as a reference guide to pastors and laymen alike who desire to be ready ""to give an answer."""
3,But the head might rip off,"Our family found these Ballerina Barbies were not that durable. Two out of three have lost their heads. It could be the girls' technique of clothing removal, but the other Barbies we have are intact...However they still play with the 'short neck'ones!"
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter, it's suppose to be a working sewing machine, nothing fancy, just a straigt stitch, but it doesn't do anything, it's worthless and please don't spend your money on it!"
1,Cheap and FRUSTRATING!,"I bought this for my daughter last christmas when she was 6. We have tried various times during the year to find the 'knack' to get this ""machine"" to work, but each time Mom gets frustrated and my daughter gets disappointed that the stitches don't stay in--Yes the stitches are supposed to be like the flour sack stitches, but the flourbag-type stitches don't actually work/loop 80% of the time. It would be better to actually to save your money and wait till your child is old enough to be taught and supervised on a real machine. Otherwise, your child will think even real sewing machines suck as bad as this toy and will never want to try a real one. A total waste of money...so sad, cause it looked like it could've been so fun."
1,Horrible,"Horrible horrible horrible! Did I mention it was horrible? It never worked from the time I took it out of the box. The needle was stuck in the down position, the presser foot is so cheaply made (plastic) that it wobbles like it's going to fall off. The thread was completely stuck under machine with no way to open it to fix it. Absolutely horrible. I got this machine on sale for $13.00 and it isn't even worth $0.13."
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"I went against my better judgement and purchased this for my daughter's birthday. She watches me sew and really wanted a sewing machine for herself. I read every review and even explained the negative feedback to her but she didnt care. So, today on her birthday I played with this thing for hours and couldnt make a single stitch. I tried the tension in every direction and just couldnt create a stitch. So guess what? Back to the store it goes tomorrow. Lesson to anyone else considering this item...PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Shouldnt a sewing machine company like SINGER be able to produce something better than this for kids by now?"
1,poorly made,"This machine is very poorly made. It is flimsy and cheep. The tension is really difficult to set and the thread breaks a lot. You basically have to take the protective shield off (by unscrewing it) and get to wear the thread base is. This happens about 10 times a sitting. My little one loves to sew, but this was quite discouraging."
1,"Received as a gift, never worked from day 1","I'm an avid sewer and a friend was very thoughtful and bought this for my 5-year old daughter so she could sew with me. But, from the moment we took this out of the box, it never worked. It skipped stitches, is extremely loud, and is very, very cheaply made. I would not buy this and instead, save a little more money and buy a used low-end sewing machine. My daughter sews on my machine and the only problem with that is getting my own sewing done :)"
1,NOT a sewing machine!,"Don't let the Singer name fool you. I'm not sure why they endorsed this item. It is a waste of your money to purchase this non-sewing machine. It is for looks only. If you truly want your little one to learn how to sew, buy a low-priced sewing machine and teach them to be careful of the needle. I wish I could give a better review, but all this item did was disappoint my daughter. I returned it and am waiting on the $37 Michley (a brand I've never heard of, but it got better reviews!). The jury's still out on that one, but I hear it is better than purchasing this for your eager learner."
1,"Bought it, tried it, returned it",I bought this machine a few days ago because my daughter is very interested in sewing. I tried it that same night and returned it the next day. Stitches come undone right away. It sounds like it is about to break apart while you are working with it. Do not spend the money!
1,sewing machine,was not what granddaughter expected. This company does not take returns. I was told to donate it. Will NEVER purchase for them again
1,No stars,"What a piece of sh it!! Don't waste your money, wish I had read reviews before my purchase. I'm so mad and frustrated that Singer would put their good name on this worthless piece of sh it."
1,Not worth it,I bought this for my 5 year old. I wasn't expecting anything fancy or great but I couldn't even get it to properly do a zig zag stitch. It's going back to the store!
1,AVOID THIS COMPANY! WORTHLESS TOY!,"I purchased this item somewhere else but decided to look at the reviews after the Christmas morning disaster, (should have checked the reviews prior to the purchase).The machine does not work. There are no stitches as stated on the box or as demonstrated on the sample cloth. There is no way that any ""fashion accsssories"" can be made as stated on the box. My 7 year old daughter was crying with disappointment.Ofcourse an email to the company has so far gone unanswered. SHAME ON THE COMPANY FOR TREATING CHILDREN LIKE THIS!"
1,Do NOT buy!,I only gave this one star because zero stars was not an option! Never worked from day 1. My daughter is so disappointed and so am I!
1,Horrible,"I bought this toy for my daughter for christmas, she is always playing with mine,I saw this toy with the protected gaurd and bought it for her. I did not have high expectations for it, I thought it would work good enough for her to make pillows, etc, but the stitches did not stay in. The machine is worthless and it does not hold stitches. I have a habit of buy christmas gifts though out the year as i see them, so even with a reciept i was unable to return the gift to the store. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!!!!! I would either buy your child/grandchild a used sewing machine or wait until they are older to learn on the ""adult"" machine. I would have given zero stars if option was given. Singer needs to pull this item off the market. HORRIBLE! :-("
2,Only buy it for basic practice for a very inexperienced youngster,"Bought this for my daughter who is ITCHING to make something - she is 7. Eventually got it to sew a straight stitch decently but it continuously messes up and once you pull out the fabric a few stitches have already come undone and it is almost impossible to tie them off. My daughter likes to run a scrap of fabric through it and it got her familiar with the pressure foot, the needle, the handwheel, and keeping the fabric straight while helping it throught the machine. Is it worth the money for a good straight stitch practice machine and basic parts tutorial? Yes, because it keeps an inexperienced seamstress off a potentially dangerous adult machine. Is it what it claims to be on the box? NO."
1,broke too quickly,"We had good luck for about two months and then it topped working. No matter how carefully we follow the instructions, we can ""sew"" a length of fabric and at the end, there's nothing to show for it. We're looking for a better machine now because this is completely worthless."
3,OK,had no installation help or instructions. Suggestion; test fit the opening with the door in the open position since more clearance on top is needed for the door.
2,CRAPPY AMAZON,"Amazon grouped all 3 of Audiovox's digital picture frames together despite MASSIVE differences. Please DON'T count on the resolution till you read chart below taken from data on Manufacturer's site.DPF1000 (10.4"")# 4:3 Aspect Ratio# 640 x 480 PixelsDPF800 (8"")# 4:3 Aspect Ratio# 800 x 600 PixelsDPF700 (7"")# 16:9 Aspect Ratio# 480 x 234 Pixels"
2,Not worth the money,This is a low priced unit -- I was very disappointed with the quality of the display and the burn-in effect when you set the unit to the calander mode. Not recommended. There are better systems out there-this one is going back to the store
1,Not so easy,"Got this digital picture frame for the ability to download pictures directly from camera with USB cable. Frame says ""Loading"", but after ten minutes, says ""No Media"". Ended up sending back to Audiovox, they sent it back with someone's personal pictures so I assumed it was working. Again plugged my camera in, same problem as I first had. Response from both Audiovox and Electronics Expo were ""it should work""."
5,excellent,great digital picture frame -- easy to set up and use for those of us who are technically-challenged.
2,What a difference a stage makes!,"I saw Adel Salameh solo on stage in Paris recently, and he was brilliant. His lute play was original and captivating, his technical performance unsurpassed. So naturally the first thing to do for me right after the concert was to get his CD. I couldn't wait to listen to it, but once I did, I doublechecked the cover to see if I had really put the right CD in the player. While it is still interesting and authentic Palestinian music, his out-of-this world lute play is drowned by vocals that leave no room to his sheer brilliance. What a pity! So, if you like vocal Palestinian music it's not a bad little CD to get. But if you are looking for a solo album of Adel Salameh's, better wait for now."
4,An alternative view of Italy,"This book is a welcome diversion from the self-indulgent, romanticized views of Italy provided by books like ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" As an American who once lived in Tuscany, I felt a sense of deja vu as I read Wilde-Menozzi's memoir, especially when she talked about the soul-splitting that can occur when you abandon the security of your own language and culture. People often talk about Italy in terms of light and warmth, but it can also be full of shadows, and one can't live there without coming to terms with both sides.This is a beautiful book, especially in that it embraces the paradoxes of two different cultures without favoring one over the other. It's not an easy read, but anyone who wants a better understanding of Italian life would benefit from it. I wish I'd had the book on hand while I was living overseas."
2,Not a True Rave But Close Enough,"Yet Again this is another CD I picked up In Europe. It's not the best Rave CD I've ever purchased, but it still has a few good tracks like 1, 2, 11, & 13. The rest of the tracks are just OK. But its still worth it. PLUR!"
5,COOL KNIFE NO BETTER THAN $80 CUTCO,"I bought this knife thinking it would slice through meat, seafood, veggies much better than any other knife I have owned. Certainly the most expensive single knife I have ever purchased. I have since used this knife along with my thirty year old nine inch Cutco. Cutting the same meat, seafood and veggies; I compared the two for ease of slicing, dicing and food pieces adhering to the blade (a nuisance for sure)Here's what I found. The much more expensive Shun slices nor dices any better than my old Cutco. It was slightly better with less sliced pieces adhering the blade, but not much. Bottom line, save your money. Buy a Cutco.PS I am not a professional chef. Those guys might need a Shun for their self esteem. However, my biggest fan (my spouse) loves most of what I cook so I am doing pretty good in the self esteem department."
2,All the collectionThe,The collection was very good except there were no closed captions. It was very hard to understand sometimes. Good selection of films.
3,an ok film,"No real comment, I watched it and enjoyed it but would not watch it again.A good gift for someone who likes Alec Guinness."
3,"Reviewed the collection. Except for Kind Hearts which stalls, jumps,, skips, stops, the other are good. Please send me replacem","Reviewed the collection. Except for Kind Hearts which stalls, jumps,, skips, stops, the other are good.Please send me replacement of Kind Hearts and Corronet"
5,Guinness Collection a winner,"If you're a fan of 40-50s British comedies then at the very least three of these will delight. Kind Hearts, Lavender Hill Mob and Ladykillers alone make this collection a prize. Guinness in Kind Hearts is in top form in all EIGHT roles."
3,Four out of five disks work,Collection contains five discs. Movies are all classic Guinness and good entertainment.One bug though - one of the discs won't play the last third of the movie - and that happened to be the one I wanted most - Kind Hearts and Coronets.So the best I can say is - It's OK - and that's being kind.
3,Alec Guinness 5 film collection,"I love this collection. However, I didn't get an opportunity to see all of the collection, my problem was with the product. The Man in the White Suit had problems and Kind Hearts and Coronets did not play at all. I tried them on two DVD players to make sure. Please let me know how to return this item. Thank you, I would appreciate hearing from you about this matter."
5,Another Guninness Please,"Take a time machine back to postwar England and enjoy life, love and death with Sir Alec. My top pick is Kind Hearts and Coronets but the other films in this collection settle upon you like a visit from an old friend. Lovely! Suitable for families, anglophiles and film fanatics alike."
1,ripped off,"Of the three discs we tried, one was in English and two were in French. His movies are great and we were very disappointed."
2,Big disappoinment,"What poor quality control. The dvd for Kind Hearts and Coronets skipped and stopped. Contacted customer service. I was instructed to wash the disk at least two times which I did. Then it seemed to be ok.What a waste of time not only to have to wash it, but then to watch it again to make sure it was viewable.The collection has 5 dvd's so I guess I'm forced to watch the others right away before the return privilege expires. Never happened to me before. Big disappointment."
1,BUY JAPANESE VERSION ON EBAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can sum up my review of Initial-D in three words, DUBBING SUCKS ASS!!!!! Buy the Japanese version on Ebay. I'm a huge Initial-D fan and I can say that America has ruined Initial-D. With all this new hype about American drifting will have us seeing people doin half-assed drifts with P.O.S. civics and crap like that. The days of Initial-D and drifting underground are over, and it sucks."
2,Dont buy this DVD!,"I love Initial D, I've been a fan for a couple of years now & I was somewhat excited about the ""new updated CG scenes"". I'll say the ""update"" is a welcome advantage, that's about all thats good about the DVD. The Dub is awful, I mean really awful, I know dubs are rarely done well, but still. The new music is crap, totally changes the mood of the races, the euro beats are better, & I dont even listen to that kind of music. Please listen to me, get the import version it's way way better & cheaper too, you can find all 5 stages on ebay for like $60. Thats season 1 & 2, the movie, an extra side story movie and the battle stage(just the racing)."
