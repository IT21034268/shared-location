1,my dogs are not deterred...,"Seems like these would work really well since the knobs are very sharp. Came home after first using them and my smaller dog was laying on top of the mat. Second instance I came home and there was hair all over the couch which means my big guy had been up there.I thought for sure this would work, there's no way I would want to sit on them but my dogs weren't the least bit fazed."
3,training mat,"This mat is very well put together and the idea behind it is very good, makes sense however it did not deter my cat they just went around it, could be bigger maybe that would help."
2,Not going to work for me...,I found my kitty sitting on the X-mat rubbing her face on the spikes. So apparently this isn't going to work for my kitty. :) I'm sure it's great for the right pet.
1,Not useful with cats,"I've had an issue with a cat who won't stay off my counters when I'm trying to feed him and the others. A cat behavior book recommended this mat so I bought it. Tried it out last night - cat doesn't care at all - just sits or walks around on it any way.I'm going to try the other method recommended which I think will be more effective as it kept my cats from clawing my office chair and buy the double-sided surgical adhesive tape from the pet store. I was hoping I could have a once-bought, long-term solution but looks like this product isn't it."
4,great product,I have a very high strung german short hair. I bought this product for our deck steps. This keeps him off the deck and away from screens at the doors and windows.I highly recommend this product.
5,A great deterrence,Was leery but this product worked immediately. Cats don't even try to get on chair now. Very pleased with price and quality.
4,Solid praise,"Crockett is classic. He mixes bluesy guitar with thoughtful lyrics and this album takes full advantage. The worst songs are good and fun, the best songs are absolute masterpiece."
4,A pair of Classics,"Two classic recordings from the golden age of folk music.The Version of MTA in the consert section is a gem , and my personal fav."
3,Historical enthusiasts only,"Obviously, This was recorded many years ago. The sound is barely passable.I've read about her and supposedly she was da ""BANG"" way back when. I've never ben a great fan of these old recordings since they often times tell little of the actual greatness of these singers. Her biography was more fascinating."
1,The Rope-Dancer,"Victor Marchetti's The Rope-Dancer is a poorly written suspense novel which I can't recommend. Littered with quotes from Nietzsche, it reads like a poorly written Ayn Rand novel (and yes, I'm aware of the redundancy of this remark) with characters to match. The themes of bureaucratic rivalry and in-fighting and the psychological 'insight' that egotism is a central component of a spy's psychological makeup are repeated throughout the 350+ pages. 'Critical' remarks about the conduct of the Vietnam war (published 1971) and an occasional operational tidbit are about all that I found interesting in this novel."
5,worth your t ime,"Several years ago I heard Susan Sutton speak on the pilgrim nature of the Christian life. The teaching, taken from Psalm 84, was a blessing. So, too, was Susan herself. She was totally genuine, without pretense or put-on. In her own quiet way, she radiated the kind of peace that many of us long for. A QUIET CENTER is not a theoretical theological study, it is the fruit of life lived out and challenges walked through. It is also a testimony to the faithfulness of God toward those who faithfully seek Him. Susan doesn't live in monastic seclusion. She has a busy and fruitful life, filled with marriage, family, ministry, and friends. What she shares about finding and building intimacy with God is real, practical, and do-able."
3,Device Physics Review,"This is a so so book on device physics, I think that there are better ones out there, but it is easy to follow and the problem sets are okay."
2,allergy alert,"Read labels,especially the ingredients list VERY CAREFULLY before drinking any tea blend.This tastes great, but,I woke up at 3a.m. and had to go to emergency, because I had difficulty breathing. Probably due to the red tea I took earlier that evening."
2,Good Earth Red tea,Thought it would be interesting to try. Prefer the standard Good Earth Tea. A bit bity in taste for me.
5,Yummy Cinnamon Tea!,I've loved Good Earth Teas eversince I had it iced at Good Earthrestaurants. Just Excellent Tea!
2,Very cute shoes but don't hold up well for the money.,"I got these shoes about two years ago, but I didn't wear them much at first. They were a little tight and a bit more dressy than I needed at the time for my very casual workplace. In the first year I probably only wore them maybe 5 or 6 times. Last May I got a new job and started wearing them ~2-3 times per week. It took a while to break them in to the point of being comfortable. Now, 9 months later the soles are all damaged and worn down in the back and the leather is splitting from the sole in the front on both shoes. For the over $200 price tag I really expected to get more life out of them since I don't think I've been wearing them very hard. My husband and I have been a Fluevog wearers for over ten years, but in the past few years we've been disappointed to have many issues with durability."
1,dull look at an interesting topic,"I've been to the region and taken better pictures than these with my Instamatic. Man with cigarette lighter wrapped in his face covering! Wow, is that, like, deeply symbolic or something? Somebody should tell David Turnley that there is a rich culture in Baghdad, and a tumultuous period of history going on. Next time, try to take get pictures of it."
5,beautiful picturebook,I bought this book as a gift for a friend who absolutely loves pansies. Every time I talk with her she thanks me for this book -- she loves to just sit down and page through this book admiring the beautiful works of nature. She is one happy little camper. I'm glad I found it!
5,I love this women!,"Helen Hadsell nous démontre clairement par ce livre tout le fonctionnement de l'esprit et de sa force de réalisation et d'attraction illimitée. C'est un guide très complet pour se servir consciemment de son subconscient pour gagner des prix, toutes sortes de prix. Sa méthode est claire et simplement expliquée, elle est facile à suivre et à appliquer. Avec de la persévérance les résultats sont certains. C'est absolument à lire !"
3,Make sure you buy HomePNA 2.0,"One of the reviewers wasn't satisfied with this product due to reliability and performance. Note that there are two different standards for HomePNA products (www.homepna.org).The HomePNA 1.0 is at 1Mbps, and HomePNA 2.0 is at 10Mbps and the 2.0 spec'd products have more horsepower to overcome line interference, static, and all the other stuff that can come on phone lines. I have a 60 year old house with pretty bad wiring, and my HomePNA 2.0 works great 24x7.So, make sure you buy HomePNA 2.0 capable hardware. This Linksys bridge is a 1.0 model... they Linksys also offer a HomePNA 2.0 capable model. The difference is 10 times the speed and robustness. Make sure you know what you are buying."
5,Love Linksys,"I have a DSL modem, which I've been using for a while. I have another computer in another part of my house which, until recently, was used to access AOL via a dialup line.I installed a phoneline interface on that computer, put PPPOE on it, modified the AOL access to go through a LAN, and bought this box. I connected the AOL computer to it via the phoneline network interface and connected my computer to it via a LAN card.Now both machines can access the internet via a single DSL modem. It worked first time. No muss, no fuss. AOL access is now completely reliable, and it flies!I was very impressed with how easy it was to make this work. I have some understanding of networking, but not a lot. If I can make this work, any literate person can."
4,the best,i think everyone should get this product. since i first used this product i realized how easy to use and how simple it made my networking life
4,Good start for non-engineers,"The language, as its title says, is non-technical, and sufficiently down to earth and basic that it is recommended lecture for those starting in the industry.Recommended to read first, before moving to more technical and engineering textbooks.More illustrations could make it even more complete.Randall Croes"
4,Biodiesel310,It's a okay book. i completed a course in refining and had this book. If you don't understand how different units work or new to the business this book would be a good place to start. easy explanation of process and useful diagrams.
3,Refining,"Book is not bad, not much technical information in it. I would have liked to see more information written about the various process's. Just gives a very broad look at the refining units."
3,Overrated,Recommended this to students but they found too much bad information. Maybe nontechnical means not worried about details being correct.
5,The crarinet concerto---WOW. I love this cd.,This is a wonderful album. All three soloists are excellent and Franklin Cohen is one of the all time great clarinet virtuosos. The Cleveland orchestra is perfect...as ususal.
2,There are better recordings of these works,"These performances are very good, but I would recommend the recordings of Robert Marcellus for the Clarinet Concerto, John DeLancie for the Oboe Concerto, and Bernard Garfield's performance of the Bassoon concerto. The performance of the Oboe Concerto on this disc is particularly dull. Why purchase this when there are better alternatives?"
4,Wild!!!,"I am new to experimental music, and I'm glad I got this CD. I think it's a great intro into such ground breaking sounds.Some tracks I enjoyed more than others, but my mind has expanded, and for me, that's the important thing!"
1,Not What I Expected,"Having loved Dirty Old Man which deals with many different aspects of sex in a delightful, funny, entertaining way, I was disappointed with what I call the ""crude"" flavor in this disc."
3,Vintage Quicksilver,"After having had the privilage of enjoying Quicksilver live at the original S.F. Fillmore during the summer of '68; they became my favorite band. I loved Moby Grape, Sly & the Family, the Dead, Love, Vanilla Fudge, Electric Flag and The Sons of Champlin...but the cast of Quicksilver,(primarily John Cippolina) were just too f'ing cool! It took me a year, but I convinced my parents into purchasing me a brand new '69 Gibson SG Standard...because that's what John played.Naturally, my favorite track on this CD is the studio version of 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You'#one of their earlist, most flawless recordings#. The live versions of 'Gold & Silver' and 'Who Do You Love'are wonderful #it's like being at their gigs#. Also notable are the studio versions of 'I Hear You Knockin' and Acapulco Gold and Silver..the whistling is too cool. ENJOY!"
1,are you kidding?,"For more than 40 years, I've followed the San Francisco music scene and a huge fan of QMS and Grateful Dead, but this album is a mess. It sounds like a compilation of someone's mediocre bootleg audience tapes haphazardly put together for the sake of selling it to make money. This is not historic material that will ever be listened to more than once. Wish I had my money back. Stick with the Capitol released originals. Happy Trails is still your best choice if just wanting to hear the best from this band. Too bad there are not copies from soundboard tapes of live shows such as the Dead's 'Dick's Picks' series as QMS was truly one of the best SF bands live! But do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Should have stayed 'unreleased and lost'."
5,Finding His Bearings via the Middle Way,"This is the story of a young man raised in the quiet reflection of a Zen monastery, but thrown suddenly into the noise, confusion, and chaos of mainstream America. The author paints a vivid picture of his struggle to adjust to a kaleidoscopic, loud, and sometimes rude new culture. He examines differences in assumptions, values, and customs, and explores the meanings in those differences. He also describes how, in the end, his Buddhist upbringing helped him come to terms with the changes.This book is clearly and vibrantly written, and very enjoyable. It's also an eye-opener. I loved it."
2,Very Repetitive,I felt that the author stretched the focus of this book by repeating the main point of the book over and over again. I would have perferred to learn more about how this problem came about in the first place and maybe how and why other religions have handled it.
1,"A disappointing, obtuse defense of clerical totalitarianism.","McInerny's basic point is that it is the Holy Father who knows and teaches what is required for our salvation: everyone must submit to the Pope. Canon law forbids dissent.Anti-papal Catholics are non-Catholics. Papal teaching cannot be rejected. A Catholic does not have a free conscience. McInerny's basic idea can be summarized again like this: a Catholic anti-modernist flees to the Pope as an infallible pastor, just as Protestant anti-modernists flee to the literal words of the Bible as infallible truth. As a response to important and profound ""modern"" questions about birth control, divorce, sexual ethics, women in the priesthood, this book is a throw-back, with the obtuse response -- punish the dissenters. That is what has gone wrong with the Church!"
5,What Went Wrong With Vatican II: The Catholic Crisis Explained,This book came ahead of the promised time and for only .01 cent it came in impeccable condition. Yes I would recommend this outfit to my friends.Thank you.
2,Humanae Vitae -not- Vatican II,"The author dose not discuss or defend the Second Vatican Council. He mearly concentrates on the effect of the dissent in opposition to Humanae Vitae, but dose not explain where this mind-set of self-rejection of Catholic teaching becomes acceptable in Catholic society today."
4,Excellent,"My first reaction when I began reading this book was that the title was (as someone else said) misleading. Those who are looking for a book about the liturgical reforms that arose from the council should look elsewhere. However, I think McInerny presents a good argument for the cause of the current crisis of authority in the Catholic Church. The book is short and leads to a neat conclusion that ties everything together. While it may seem like all the discussion about Humanae Vitae is off topic, it is not, and in fact it allows the book to work in two ways: both as a discussion of the current tension between the Magisterium and dissenting theologians, and as a good description of how conscience is supposed to function for an individual Catholic."
3,Good but I had higher expectations,"Rather than the title ""What Went Wrong With Vatican II"" this book should have had a title about the fallout after Humanae Vitae because that is it's main focus. It is an easy read though and, looking back now, was probably one of the first books by a main-stream publisher to critique the post-conciliar situation in a sound way. I think that it was fine for a few years ago but there have been more and better treatments of the subject since it came out."
1,"Objection to being published under ""Idiot""","As a Counselor & Spiritual Director I am very interested in women's spirituality. I was attracted to this book but will not buy it because I find it insulting to myself & my clients to be under the title ""Idiot."" I would think this publisher would find a more positive approach to their books."
3,It's not worth it!b,"If you have the normal CD then don't buy this one. The extra song is not that good. It is the same thing to pay US$12,00 for only one song. If you are a big Hole fan, don't have the normal album and are rich, then this album is for you...."
3,Does the job - assemble with care,"My husband needed a huge storage/display unit like this and it does the job. When it's full, move it slowly. As others have noted, have two people on hand to assemble and move/roll the partially assembled unit with extreme care - the particular board panels crack easily."
5,Disc Tower,"I received this item two days late but it was shipped over the Labor Day holiday with could have delayed the shipment so that was no big deal. None of the pieces were broken when I opened the packages and there were no pieces missing after it was all put together. It's perfect for anyone that has a bunch of CD's, DVDs or Blu-Ray Discs and wants to keep them all in one place. It's very heavy when assembled and it takes two people for assembly. I'd recommend this product to anyone."
1,DONT BUY IT!,"HORRIBLY MADE PRODUCT. ONE OF THE SCREWS BROKE THREW THE FAKE WOOD AS I WAS WORKING ON AN OPPOSITE SIDE, NOT ABLE TO REPAIR. CHEAPLY MADE, SCRATCHED UP, SWIVEL DOESNT STAY INSIDE THE HOLE SO IF YOU TRY TO MOVE IT ACROOS THE FLOOR THE WHOLE RACK WANTS TO TIP OVER. I ALMOST JUST THREW IT AWAY BUT I'M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK. VERY DISSAPOINTED. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Oak Finish Large 4-Sided Spinning Multimedia Storage Tower,"The tower is big and very sturdy. Building the tower totally a different story. The instructions were not easy to follow. Three people had to review the instructions. The tower took five attempts when finally it was layed on the foundation without the screws to see the final picture. It was then, that we all started to place the screws in place.After building it, now the tower received compliments. It hold manys CD's. VHS takes up alot space. DVD's seems to take up space too, to my surprise.Delivery took very long. I was support to get free shipping but was charged for the shipping. Not clear on how this works. Amazon says free shipping on items $49 and over. Meanwhile, my tower was $151. With shipping cost of $67 (to my surprise) the final price was $218.Thanks."
4,Massively Awesome,"If you have a metric ton of Blu-Rays/DVDs/CDs/VHS(really? people still have these?)/etc, then you need one of these. It's a very attractive piece of furniture and holds an incredible amount of DVDs. Assembly could have been a bit easier as the instructions can be confusing (took me a couple tries to get it right). But once it was assembled, I had a nice, big case to hold all of my movies."
5,1945 - 1950 Decca Studio Masters on CD - Jolson's Best,"This 2 cd set contains 58 out of 71 Decca Studio masters from 1945 to 1950. At this time, Jolson's voice had its deepest and most soulful, resonant tone. The highlight is the set of eight Stephen Foster songs, Jolson's last recordings. It's hard to name another major singer whose voice and sound were at their peak at age 64. Jolson is amazing, and this set is a bargain."
1,NOT Paul Schwartz,"I bought this cd because according to the info from [store name], the composer of the CD was Paul Schwartz. HE ISN'T!! I thought it was going to be similar to the two ARIA CD's that I have that were more electronic and operatic music. This was hard rock music and the composer was a guy named Paul Genet!! So [company name] has it wrong! It is not the same composer."
4,Thank you for some good advice!,I was so surprised when I started reading You and Him as I've never really identified how I act in relationships. Things have been rocky and I was tired of making bad choices with men. But this book showed me that I was always behaving the same way - I'm a controlling Goldilocks. Bet that sounds confusing but it won't if you read this - the Goldilocks styles are the way women act in relationships. And I recognised myself - I try to control everything through fears I have. My advice is read this and see how you fit in. It also helped me understand how men think which is in the second half of the book. I hope you learn like I did!
5,When my heart was heavy this book lifted my spirits!,I thought there was something wrong with me when it came to men - I always had unhappy relationships and never understood where things went wrong. I'd read other self-help books but it was like a fog lifting when I started Dr. Spurr's book. It made so much sense to me and hepled me identify my own behavior - and how that kept me locked into a certain relationship style. Let me tell you that this book showed me how I might enhance the way I was and understand men better. It has helped and the chapter on compatibility is amazing! It all made so much sense. If you need to improve your relationships than try reading You and Him!
3,Good Songs,"I bought this for the songs and while iu like the songs on the CD I could do without the ""children's voices"" to sing them. It makes it to cartoonish and takes away from the songs."
1,Don't buy this CD,"The CD itself is really bad, the music is like salsa style of music but the songs does not go well with the music, it is very boring for children, do not buy it you wil be very dissapointed. In the other hand Amazon, returned my money without sending back the CD, that is great but anyways i just leave the CD on a box because i can not evven give it away because the musuc is terrible."
5,Great Spanish Children's Music CD,"This CD tops my daughter's list of favorites. She loves to sing and dance to the songs and requests ""Bamba Bamba"" almost daily. Most tunes are upbeat. The children's voices make it attractive to young ones."
5,LOVE IT,"My bilingual daughter loves this cd. Everytime we get in the car she begs for ""Bamba"" - aka ""La Bamba"". I highly recommend."
2,Underinformative and overopinionated,"This book was a disappointment. It is very small, short, and in large type. There is no discussion of exactly who the electors have been, exactly how they were chosen, and why, throughout U.S. history. There is no mention of how the college originally functioned, or of why the current system developed. There is no explication of unfaithful electors, their motives, or their fates. The book is less information about the electoral college than a politically conservative defense of it. The book needs updating based on the 2000 election; for example, the book repeatedly defends the college by stating the college magnifies the victory margin of the popular vote winner. The book leaves the reader wondering if the writers would defend the college if the outcome in 2000 were as predicted, with the Democrat winning the electoral vote but not the popular vote, instead of the actual (reverse) result."
5,Goth Like the Good Ol' Days,A beautiful male vocalist.Traditional Goth music: perfect for those who are Elder Goths or who can appreciate Goth music of before...I purchased my disc last week and it has not left my CD player in my car.Do I need to say anything else? Buy it.
1,Best hardcore band.,Norma Jean are one of the greatest hardcore/metalcore bands of our time. Especially for christians.
5,A fantastic album!,"This album has your feet tapping all the way through it....not to mention having you singing along! I know the guys, so I guess that has some influence on how I feel, but this really is an amazing album and well worth getting your hands on a copy! In my opinion the best tracks are Alba Vinyl, Fiona, The Breadman, and Dead and Gone. Go! Buy it now!!! You know you want to!"
5,bon boyage,"Charlie and his family were personal friends with our family. He wrote this out of the grief of his two boys' death.Charlie packed for the big trip himself recently and sailed for a distant shore, the victim of ALS."
4,Really nice writing experience,"I'm kind of a 'pen' nut and pick up pens frequently. This pen, the Client, is one of the best in my opinion. The thickness is just right for a comfortable feel. I don't need to squeeze it to prevent it from rolling through my fingers because of the rubber grip. That means I can relax my fingers while writing. The ink and tip flow smoothly and never blotch or clog.This one is just as good for fit and performance as my $250 Waterman pen. Enjoy your writing!"
1,Inspired wedding of misinformation with lack of substance,I was tempted to give this book TWO stars until I realized it wasn't intended as a work of fiction.Mr. Klein's apparent lack of knowledge about classic beer styles and the history of brewing is equaled only by his propensity for expressing personal opinion and heresay as if it were established fact. Knowledgeble beer drinkers might want this book for it's unintended humor-value; I would most certainly NOT recommend it to the novice seeking to learn more about beer -- go for Jackson instead.I will give Mr. Klein credit--he appears to have sampled a respectable amount of beer.
1,Probably the worst beer guide ever published.,"For a couple of years now, Bob Klein's book has been the laughingstock of brewers, homebrewers, and beer connoisseurs in the entire English-speaking world. His ignorance of beer and brewing is matched only by his wooden palate and unquenchable arrogance. Choose Michael Jackson, Roget Protz, or Tim Webb instead."
1,I Laughed! I Cried!,"As the current Undersecretary of Olfactory Sensations of the International Association of Beer Enthusiasts named Dave, and current holder of the prestigious Otto Award for Excellence in beer criticism found on the web (presented by none other than Otto himself), I feel obligated to suggest that this volume by Mr. Klein is highly problematic. While Klein's book is certainly exhaustive, one is left with the impression that his knowledge of beer styles and brewing is sketchy at best, and that his palate is rather idiosyncratic. However, for a mere $5.95, the humor value alone warrants a perusal."
1,A Hilarious Parody!,"Klein is a master comedian! God he cracks me up, page after page of words lampooning those snooty beer reviewers that need not be named. Oh lord, I'm busting my gut, ha ha haaaaaaa! Don't take my word for it, pick it up and you'll blow beer out your nose it's so funny! And to think all the reviewers here thought he was serious! Ahhh ha ha ha ha HHAAAAAAA"
1,Disappointing,"Maybe its not the worst book on beer ever written... Ok, I take that back, it *is* the worst book on beer ever written. Steer very clear."
2,Not Trustworthy,"You simply can't trust his ratings. Anyone who raves on and on about Rogue products, e.g., giving Shakespeare Stout 4.7 out of 5, has simple lost it. Anderson Valley brews, which are generally undrinkable, are also rated high.It's not that he gets nothing right; it's just that he gets lots of things wrong."
4,Montana Salutes you Bob Clear!,"Think ""Big"" is too small a word to describe Big Sky Country, that's why we all don't need no darn BEER FOR DUMMIES book. A good day on the range, or in the Governer's Mansion, is finished off with a good plate of MONTANA beans, a steak or wiener, and some clear bubbly beer, freshly minted and reviewed by Dangit We Salute You BOB CLEAR!Like I told Ralph D.Peck and my Good Buddy J.Prendergast over a Good Old American Heinekinn and shots at Executive 'White Level' Chitchat meetings SEVERAL times, that Good Ol' Bob Clear shur knows 'bout beer. Bet he'd be a good man to take over Peck's job someday. If he can shoot straight like an honest American!Yes, sir. MARC RACICOT of MONTANA"
1,Great website!,I just found your web site and I really like the ability to rate books and provide feedback. I read through some of this book at a bookstore and I have to say it was awful. If I wrote this book this bad I'd be ashamed to put my name on it.
2,This guy couldn't tell a beer from a hole in the ground...,"While some of his reviews are descriptive, some of the ratings he gives are freakin rediculous. This guy only gives Duvel 2.9, but gives Heineken a 3.4....what the? Duvel is regarded by many to be one of the best Belgian strong pale ales in the world, while quite the opposite could be said of Heineken.I bought this book for 25 cents from the library, but it wouldn't be worth any more than that. You're better off spending your money on anything written by Michael Jackson."
1,Not a troll,"I am not a troll nor do I play one on the Internet. I do, however, think that there are many, many better ways for a true beer-lover to spend his or her money than on this ill-conceived, poorly-researched, sadly-executed, literary equivalent to an enema."
2,What's all the fuss?,"I don't understand all the glowing reviews and utter pans this book has gotten. It is probably not the worst beer review book ever written but there are so many better ones out there that, ""Why bother?"" What does annoy me about the book is that it is written in what I would call ""pseudo-wine review prose"" with lots of beautiful, but ultimately meaningless terms tossed into the reviews. In all honesty, I would recommend any of the works of the respected beer-critic, Michael Jackson, over this one."
1,The worst book about beer I've ever read,"In my honest opinion, this is the worst beer-related book I've ever had the displeasure to read. The beer reviews are often contradictory, paradoxical, or just worthless for their lack of concrete information about the beer. I would not recommend it"
5,Truly Breathtaking,"What an accomplished work! I don't believe any other author has approached this subject with the knowledge and skill of this author. The intelligence and scope of this award winning book is awe inspiring. No beer expert's library is adequate without this astounding volume by the most reknown beer scholar in America. Bravo, Herr Klein!"
1,Tell me why?,"When my Daddy read this book he started crying and has barely stopped since I was 4. I'm only 6 so I don't know about beer, but I know a bad thing when I see it. Mr. Klein, why did you do this to my Daddy?"
3,"Super-pretentious, but still useful","One of the few books in my ""vast"" collection that I refer to constantly. The rating system is excellent (0.0 to 5.0). I still think that this book is very, very pretentious (the author has ridiculous comments about which food pairings go with which beers, as if it were fine wine. Dude, they are just beers, ok ?).But still, I give this book thumbs-up."
1,Bad prose and uninformed commentary make a poor combination,Stay away at all costs and if you are given this book as a gift politely inquire as to whether a receipt is available. You'll need it.
1,A good book for kindling...,"but unfortunately not much else. This book provides only warm and fuzzy beer reviews which are little more than personal preferences disguised as objective commentary. The lack of beer knowledge exemplified in this work is astounding. Miller Lite rates objectively higher than Hoegaarden Grand Cru, Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, and Thomas Hardy ale? Pub Draught Guinness in the widget can is too foamy? Sam Adams triple bock is the best beer in the world? Sheesh."
1,Klein and beer; Oil and water.,Klein and beer just don't mix in this book at all. Sly and witty words don't make a review ... an open mind does.
1,Why Oh Why?,"Don't buy this book, it is a big waste of time. One should not rate a beer on personal preference but rather with an open mind. The End."
1,Huh?!?,"After reading such uni-stellar reviews from names I actually _know_ from the world of beer, I just _HAD_ to get this book...Any serious beer lover/hobbiest or candidate for the BJCP exam would do well to steer clear of this material. I'm sure Mr. Klein meant well, but this book misses the mark. Actually, from where it puts you, you'd need a GPS and a fast plane to get anywhere near the mark in your lifetime. Jackson or Eckhardt would be my recommendation."
1,"What was he thinking, that he is a beer god.",When I first got this book as a X-mas present I thought it would help me understand the depths of what a beer could be. It turns out that his reviews are as bland as a bud. It is sad that he is misinforming so many people out there.
1,Skip it,"A book full of factual errors. Best used as comic relief but is certainly not a credible reference book. His palate is as suspect as his knowledge of beer and beer history. Doesn't matter how many beers one has tasted if you don't know what you're looking for. Lots a awards cited from organizations no one who is connected with beer has ever heard of. Beginners should look to Micheal Jackson's Pocket Guide, as it is a superior book."
1,I don't like this book,It is full of pseudo-highbrow wine-tasting verbiage which is used inappropriately for the most part.
5,Very Enjoyable,"I found this guide well-informed and quite enjoyable. I appreciate authors who know their subject and from what I discovered in this book, Mr. Klein knows beer better than most."
1,Example,"Page 191: Orval scores 2.1; Pabst Blue Ribbon scores 2.1. If this sounds about right to you, then by all means buy this book. Otherwise, you are better off trusting your own judgement when tasting beer instead of this ""guide""."
1,"Oooh, he's updating this fall!","Now we'll get to see if Bob has tried to make his reviews more than a few colorful, useless adjectives based on one bottle or draft sample. While I commend the quantity of beers sampled, it would be nice to see him do a good job comparing and judging beers this time. If he really still thinks that a large number of mass-produced American Light Lagers are better than *objectively* better (read: no additivies, adjuncts or fillers) lagers and pilsners from smaller breweries, let alone some of the best beers in the world, well, he's entitled to his opinion but any semi-serious beer judge would laugh in his Brussels-lace-covered face. I'll be looking for this book in the local B&N before I plunk down any money, here or elsewhere -- given the uselessness of the 1995 version, I suggest the same caution for anyone considering the purchase of the update."
2,THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR AN UNBIAS REVIEW,"After forcing myself to read every single review, I felt the need to review this book in order to help others confused by the previous 5 star or 1 star reviews. The truth is somewhere in between. Klein does think he is reviewing wine with all his flowery words and he is inconsistant with clearly comparable brews. However, the hard info defining the different types as well as bringing to light new brands and even known brands with unheard of products deserves some entertainment value. Which brings about the most important part of this review. Buy this for entertainment purposes only! Don't take the reviews seriously as they are absurdly overstated and inaccurate!"
2,I give this book a 2.0 on the beer scale...,"Weak and watered down are some words that I use to describe this book. Moreover, I am totally confused by some of his ratings. He appears to give very low ratings to what can be considered benchmark brews. Take Samuel Smith's Pale Ale, he gives it a 3.0 when most experts will tell you that it is one of the finest examples of the style. A similarly confusing rating is fixed to Fuller's ESB - many Bitter producers use Fuller's as a target to shoot for. Meanwhile, Miller High Life gets a 2.4 [....].Basically, if a beer is a Trappist or an Abbey ale it is automatically a good beer according to Klein; yet other ales are questionable in the book. I am a huge fan of Trappist and Abbey beer, but the world of beer is much broader than Klein's book would lead us to believe.Pass on this book and buy Michael Jackson's books; he is far less nebulous and capricious when it comes to describing different beers."
1,I agree with the last reviewer,"the author is definitely a commen(sic) tater, as in his commentary resembles what you might expect from Mr. PotatoHead. San Fransisco Beer Institute, sheeh."
1,Poor Commentary,"I thought this was badly done, thoughtless, and insipid commentary. It certainly doesn't deserve the mindless positive reviews that pack this page and serve no other purpose than to insult your intelligence. I do not recommend this book and I hope readers interested in beer will do themselves a favor and check out any of the books by noted beer author Michael Jackson instead."
2,With Art in Mind: A Collection of 60 Art Lessons,"This book is skeletal at best, with no art standard connections and very dated material. The best thing about this book is the illustrated examples, too bad the lessons are so lame."
3,A Good General Guide,"This book has a great deal of good, general information. It's a very helpful overview without getting too specific. Depending on what you are looking for this book may or may not be good for you. If you want specific product reccomendations, look elsewhere. After reading this book I still had to research different types of products and read up on product reviews. I wanted more from this book, something I could take to the store with me, if you will and use as a guide as to specific items I could benefit from. This was not it."
5,A Very Informative Book,This book has a wealth of information for women of color and some very great looking and artistic pictures.
3,"If you own a lot of books, then buy this . . .",The only reason I rate this book lower is that it is not the kind of pithy book I want when I pay for a book by a great teacher. This is some of the verses of Padampa Sangye (alias Acharya Kamalashila) and it was fine . . . but there are so many much better books by this great great teacher!
3,Nice set of software. Fair price. Read the license.,"MS Office XP is the best Office to date. It has minimal bugs, and number of nice usability features. The educational edition sells for what the suite should normally be priced at. The full, non-upgrade price is obscene.Read the license carefully. Not only must you be a student or teacher, but you must agree to stop using the software the day you graduate or stop teaching. If you wish to continue using MS Office, you're obligated to shell out four times as much for the retail version.You should look carefully at the other office suites available. MS has been king of the hill for awhile, but Corel's suite will easily handle everything 95% of MS Office users need, at a fraction of the retail price."
2,Don't educators deserve security patches?,"While I thoroughly support Microsoft Office over any other similar suite, I strongly condemn Microsoft for denying upgrades and patches to educators. Given the price for this version, denying a full upgrade to the next version is certainly fair, but Microsoft has issued a plethora of patches, many of them involving security issues, to this version and denying them to educators is both prejudicial and dangerous. In addition, it just isn't good business!"
5,microsoft Office XP Standard for students and teachers,I am happy with the product. I am not happy with the fact that I did not recieve the ... rebate/ special offer coupon with my purchase as stated in you add. ...
1,Explodes for no adequately explored reason; still overpriced,"Not only do we continue to buy this overpriced software, but it continues to explode for no adequately explored reason, as well.As long as there was no actual choice, if one had to create Word files, then at least it kind of made sense to continue spending the money.However, now there is no reason to continue with the money flushing. StarOffice is a great deal cheaper even than the student discount, works the same way, reads and creates Word Excel and PowerPoint files i.e. MS Office formats, and is all in all an entirely serviceable product.And yes, StarOffice runs on Windows too."
3,Review for Office XP for students and teachers.,"To start, Office XP for students and teachers is too [spendy]compared to Office 2000. There wasn't enough of a description of the product. The shipping in 24 hours is a plus."
5,Microsoft Office XP,I rated this product so highly because it does everything I wanted it to do. I needed MS Word and now have it. The price also helped with the decision.
2,I wish I had read the reviews.....,"Had I read the reviews on this product, I would have reconsidered my purchase. I didn't know that I would not be able to load it onto both of my home computers or even load it at home and on the laptop that my daughter takes with her to college. I'm told that if I want to install onto 2 computers that I have to buy the full version of Office XP Standard and even that will only load on 2 computers. I shouldn't have to buy 2 copies when I have 2 home computers and 2 children in college at the same time."
1,Disappointed,"I like the functionality of this version of Office XP 2002 however as another customer has posted a caveat in his review, I did encounter a very rude awakening when I installed this version onto my desktop and then onto my laptop having read somewhere that it could be licensed for up to three computers. Well I was wrong. I do not recommend this product, no matter how attractive the rebate is. Its not worth the money. You're better off buying the full suite verson elsewhere."
2,Why buy the cow?,"[website] is a complete MS-compatible suite absolutely free. [website] is... freeware. At that price, it makes no sense to pay bloated MS fees."
2,Some nice software but overpriced,"I bought Office XP only to find Open Office two weeks later which is free and nearly as good. Power Point is better than Impress in Open Office, but for the light use I make of it, I could easily use nothing but Open Office.If you have 130 bucks to spend go for it, but I would recommend seeing if Open Office will work for you especially since you don't have to buy it and you don't have to worry about licensing...If it is Free its for me...this aint free :(--Joey"
3,willow action figure,nice collectible--figure looks a bit different than picture on the box- good stuff
4,"A little heavy on the religious education, but fun","Even though I found all the background on the Jewish faith and religion kind of like sitting in a religion 101 class, the story was cute. I especially loved the ending, which made me think that there's another story about the therapist somewhere - she was almost like Mary Poppins-ish. I wish we'd gotten to the show/feast sooner, and that it lasted a little longer, but this was a great first book that was enjoyable."
1,Got to Page 69 and I gave up,"""The Matzo Ball Heiress"" by Laurie Gwen Shapiro proves the old saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" The cover of this book looks fun, but the inside is a dull book. Heather Greenbolz is the thirty-one heiress to the most famous matzo company, who may look perfect, but her family is crazy. I only got to page 69, and just gave up because the book is dull and 69 pages seem like 269 pages. Just do yourself a favor and skip this book."
4,Good but not great- and some of these facts are fiction!,"As an orthodox Jew, I was dismayed that there are such glaring mistakes in this book. Yom Kippur is not ""when you fast to mourn the dead."" (page 16) And would a kosher guy really marry a gal who doesn't keep kosher ""out of the house?"" Poor confused children....BUT, the book is fun, taking a look at American Judaism, sad that it is. Great main character and her supporting cast (family) is a blast. Jews will enjoy this- the rest of you- I don't know!"
3,"Meh, okay","I'm a huge fan of chick lit and Red Dress Ink books, but this book didn't really do it for me. There's a bit too much angst about Judaism and often the angst seems unnecessary and over the top. The characters are likable and the plot has great potential but the author doesn't really deliver. It's fine but it doesn't really provide the distraction I want out of this type of reading. It was a bit too easy to put down."
4,Pure Fun and Full of Humor,"I'm new to the work of Laurie Gwen Shapiro.... I haven't read any of her stuff before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. I was really pleasantly surprised. I found her new book ""The Matzo Ball Heiress"" really funny, unique and truly different.Main character Heather Greenboltz is surrounded by a million and done crazy characters and I loved meeting each and everyone. The humor she runs through the story is first class.I really enjoyed this new addition to the Red Dress Ink family and think that Ms. Shapiro might be its newest hit!Cheers!"
1,No !,"Had to read for my book club. Not my kind of thing. Willing to try new authors, but this will not be one of them."
2,Nothing Super about these dvds,"You can take the Super out of Super Slams. I remembered as a young child watching the original when it came out, and thought it was great. Not so when I watched them all again."
2,"If you want to be depressed, just read this book.","What can I say, this book was totally disapointing and depressing. Right from the beginning, one bad thing after another. Never any joy or happiness. You'd get a little peek at the h/h possibly being on their way to getting back together and then the hero would say and think something really stupid and we'd be right back to Nikkie hating Wade and not wanting anything to do with him. I skimmed thru a good portion of this book just to get thru it. Even tho there is a HEA ending (sort of) I would never have read this book if I had known it was such a heart wrenching let down. It could have been so much better. There were so many typos and editing problems that it was very distracting also."
2,marginal at best,"I have an unamplified directional set of rabbit ears which works just as well, and in some cases better."
4,Great Expectations,"I live in a difficult area as far as TV reception is concerned,under a mountain, and this antenna is by far the best of the four that I have used. I can now view two local news channels with a reasonably good picture and a third which is watchable.The apparatus is well designed and sits unobtrusively on the TV."
4,RCA ANTENNA Amplified,"Having another of this same model, I purchased this for another TV. It works fine at my location in a suburban location, the amplifier is a bonus to enable reception of distant stations."
2,Indoor TV antenna,"I live in a particularly bad spot for TV reception and have been forced to use cable. This antenna brings in several local stations but the quality of the picture is unsatisfactory. So, unfortunately, for me it's either back to cable or try an amplified outside antenna.Miles Kennedy"
1,returned it,"I bought 4 amplified antennas to test which one worked the best for home. This was the most expensive one. The first thought was it has got to get better than this. I had to keep changing it to get a good picture, and to many times. It is not were close to cable. Audio was good, but so were all the others. I took this one back, but I kept a GE."
1,It looks fancy,"No better than a regular rabbit ears antenna. I moved it every which way, I even daisy chained it to my old antenna so see if it atleast helped. I get better reception with the basic plain antenna oddly enough."
3,Okay but not great!,"When I bought my new flat screen TV/VCR/DVD combo, I thought I would ""upgrade"" my antenna as well. I have to admit that I now receive two more channels and some of the others come in clearer now. The only thing I don't like is that every single time you go to a particular channel you have to fool with this antenna to get a clear picture. My old antenna once you set it for a particular channel, that channel always came in clear and maybe the others a little shadowy but it was always great for that channel. This one is not that way,if you set it say for CBS to come in clear and you surf the other channels during a commercial break when you come back to CBS you have to twittle with the antenna again to get it to come in clear even though you never touched it when surfing through the other channels. The non powered rabbit ears with the halo works just as well.The positive is that Amazon's price was a lot less expensive than the competitions."
1,"yeah, beats a bare wire","Like other reviewers, I found it requires constant adjustment for the UHF loop, even though all my UHF stations broadcast from one of two locations within about 20 degrees of each other.Also, while the gain on the amplifier is adjustable (and adjustable separately for VHF and UHF), it is not adjustable down to zero; you must turn it off using a very stiff, teensy tiny fiddly little 3-way switch on the back (third setting was bypass, e.g. for cable).Since some local channels (both VHF and UHF) are strong enough that even minimal gain setting was too much, my switch got a lot of use. But it broke after 2-3 months.Why only 1 star? Because of the crummy design. Good signal quality (which it has, once adjusted) is the minimum expectation. I'd like to be able to easily use the device.So I'm looking for a replacement."
3,OK for the price,"Generally a good antenna. I live in the Chicago land area and couple channels don't come out at all with my old out side antenna (channel 2 and 11). this inside antenna works better than my old outside antenna. Couple channels still don't come out very clear but very viewable. You have to adjust it a lot to get fairly clear pictures. Using flat sheet of tin foil on one of the arms improves my worst channels. My dad bought one and put it in his attic. After a lot of adjustments, most of the local channels come out clear. I think this antenna is as good as any outside antenna if you mount it up high in an attic. This will require some work to bring power to the antenna and run the cable down to the TV."
4,RCA Amplified ANT 1250,"All in all the antenna works great. I was able to receive four additional channels that I was not able to see before. The only drawback, I just hate to fiddle with setting the reception for each channel. I was spoiled using the no longer marketed Jensen940 amplified antenna which had a feature to remember the signal settings for each channel watched. This antenna would be a perfect one if it incorporated that feature!! As far as performance, considering it has 45 db amplification, it works much better than most on the market. The receptions are clear with very little, if any, ghosting on the channels once you set the dipoles. I have tried other brands and found their performance lacking; so of course, I took those back. Looks like this one is a keeper.As far as price, Target has a very reasonable price of around $28. I have seen this priced much higher, which to me is a price overkill considering the RCA ANT1250 has no electronic features for it's operation."
3,"Depending on where you live, this may not help you","I recently purchased this item hoping for better reception and less tin foil for my home in the hills of Los Angeles. If you live in an area that is hard to get a signal already, this item is not going to help you much. Compared to my other antenna with out the tin foil, initially the reception was a little bit better, but not enough to get a clear picture or audio, and I could only receive about 2 of the 5 local channels. With tin foil, a lot of tin foil, I can almost get those 2 channels but with less than perfect picture quality. I thought having UHF and VHF dials and being able to control them manually would have a better impact on my picture and sound, but I find that I have to keep them both on MAX. Not an impressive difference from the other power antennas with only signal strength dials to keep me satisfied. Again, I live in an area that is almost impossible to get a signal, so this product might perform better in more urban areas."
1,Defective power source,"The power source does not work, and I have been having a heck of a time finding a replacement. Also, my reception is worse with this antenna when it does work."
2,Dipoles became loose and did not maintain position,"This antenna was working pretty well until the dipole hinge began toloosen and could no longer maintain position. I tried tightening itbut there was no good solution. So ordered a Terk antenna and I hope it will last longer.Even if it worked well enough, it was not worth my money because itdidn't last."
1,Not worth the money you pay for it.,1) You get only 4-5 channels and that too of not great quality reception.2) UHF/VHF amplication also does not work well.3) It is as good as a rabit ear antenna.
2,ok but needs a little force,"I got this antenna because I have DISH Network and they don't offer local channels so I wanted the local channels to look like digital from the antenna and this was on sale. It also shows a graph, but I can't believe its the truth but its a LIE! I rather get a $100 or a $200 antenna more than this. Also, I rather trade this with a 10 year old tv because it don't work like the way I wanted it to work. The only good thing about this is that its on SALE! Its on sale because no one bought it!"
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"This was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever watched. Partly due to the low-budget quality coupled with terrible acting and writing. It was so slow that at times I felt like I was watching an old talkie. There is a 10 minute short film in there somewhere, but it is hidden with so many montages and worthless scenes in an attempt to make a full length movie out of every second of film they shot, that I don't know what happened to the real story.Thankfully I bought this with a free 3$ credit from amazon, but I would gladly pay 3$ to get that hour of my life back."
4,The New Life,"Worth buying solely for the first two pieces, Incipit Vita Nova, a lovingly unfolded song - half tribute, half lullaby - for string trio and David James's exceptional voice, and Glorious Hill, for a quartet of voices, which showcases Bryars' ability to write vocal music which changes constantly but maintains an essential succinctness of expression. Bryars manages to personalise his source material and create music of depth, imagination and cunning."
3,This book was confusing!!!!,"I can't say that I didn't like ""Jimmy""s Girl."" I did like it for the most part...but.....I didn't like the fact that I had to read the same thing 2 chapters in a row. Hearing it once is good enough for me."
3,Almost works but falls flat...,"I picked this one up with great eagerness, wanting to know what happened to two ex-lovers who met again later in life. Would they see their younger selves reflected in each others' eyes? Or would they find they'd grown apart?While the author answers these questions, somehow the people in this book just didn't come alive to me. They seemed flat stereotypes, not real, vibrant people. I found myself growing impatient to find out ""What happened"" but there was way too much space given to the build-up before the reunion of Emily and Jimmy (her high school sweetheart) and not enough focus on their time together.Also, each chapter is devoted to the SAME event told by either Emily or Jimmy's point of view. I found this tedious to slog through and somehow irritating as well. In short, this one left me cold....although I managed to stick with it till about halfway through the book."
2,"A great idea for a story, but so much was missing","This was a really wonderful idea for a story but I felt it lacked the passion it needed to truly captivate the reader. Emily's character was much too practical and uptight to be an intriguing main character. I felt like I didn't really get inside her head while reading this book because the writing seemed to emphasize surroundings rather than feelings. You got the feeling she was a deep person, but she just never completely opened up on the page. The character Jimmy was a stronger character because his feelings were more exposed to the reader and he was more dark and temperamental; I enjoyed the chapters where he was narrating. This story had so much potential, all it needed was two strong main characters and more passion."
2,Little to Recomend,"I bought this book because of it's supposed similiarity to an author I like. I was very disapointed. The plot line is weak, something you could find in any number of other books. It's poorly written to boot and is not very believable. Two people that are both happily married begin to wonder about the what might have beens. And of course, they have to go off and find out. To predictable and slow moving."
2,Tripe,"First swimming lessons and first loves take place in the shallow end of the pool. Emily and Jimmy never got past the 4 foot mark. Her married life is like playing house, and his is a sullen refusal to get on with it. All because they've nobly carried their torches for 20-odd years. Emily and Jimmie can fantasize themselves as sacrifices, but Stephanie Gertler's competent writing can't make them interesting."
3,Something's Missing Here,"This novel explores the rekindling of first love from the perspective of a 40-something woman and man. Languishing in an unfulfilling and boring marriage, Emily contrives to contact her first love in order to paint a series of pictures relating to his Vietnam experience. Jimmy, a sort of loser in the south, sees this as his chance to feel important in life again and exorcise some pain. There are many unbelievable things about this book, including the ease with which their spouses ok this obvious weekend affair. Why don't they kick up a fuss? And if nobody has the energy to object, why do the main characters choose to return to their marriages? The whole thing is somewhat distastful. Why not put all of this energy into improving their current relationships?"
3,Jimmy's Girl,"OK story. High school sweathearts reunite after many years, catch up on one another lives. Lady in story couldn't make up her mind if she wanted her present life or wanted to dream about ""what could have been"" with her high school boyfriend"
5,Awesome,"I read this a while back, but anything by Leslie Kelly is a treat!She's one ofmy favourite authors. Read it, you won't regret it."
4,Lock on No.23,Excellent photos and descriptions. i worked on them for years and they referenced and photographed all of the right stuff
2,A typical technical analysis book,* Very limited* Not practical in real life market settings*Contains very little info on the various technical analysis approaches to the market.* Ignores some of the most common successful working methods of technical analysis.* INTERESTING THEORETICAL READING NEVER THE LESS
4,Nice assortment,"Another good collection of Wellman stories, well written and enjoyable. ""Ever the Faith Endures"" is my favorite here, a nice little tale of a man visiting a distant British relation and finding out a surprising family secret. ""The Theatre Upstairs"" is a nice weird story of revenge, while the title story features a Nazi general taking over a Romanian castle with only one occupant (not hard to guess who the occupant was). Over two dozen stories in all, with something for everyone."
5,Not Just Morning Mood... All Day Mood,I have been looking for a copy of this music for years and this arrangement is my favorite.
3,"Good, but not great","If you liked Kazemachi Roman, then you have to buy this. As an album its not as good, especially the first half drags a bit. The second half picks up with some nice laid back catchy tunes and stellar guitar work. The recording of this album is kind of weird though, be warned, it sounds somewhat muffled. Nothing to worry about though, if you own Kazemachi Roman, then you must own this too."
3,"Good progressive metal, but not my style","One of the other reviewers liked ""Paradox"" over ""Fear"". I would rank them equally. It is correct that John West never lets loose on this, its very similar to his last release with Artension. (neither does D.C. Cooper on ""Paradox"") I'm not a big fan of the ""grand"" or ""regal"" style of metal presented here, but I am not disappointed by any means. If you want to hear John West belt it out, get his solo effort ""Permanent Mark""."
4,Very complete I refer to it often,I am a 15 year veteran of the custodial field and have used this text extensively. I teach the custodial trade and recommend this text to all my students.
5,very informative,I am new to the custodial field (3 yrs) and have found this book to be very helpful. Easy to read and great for on the job reference.
2,Not worth the money to me.,"Maybe if you're clumsy and not very innovative you would get more out of it, but basically, I've only been one-handed for under three weeks and I believe I can do better than some of the tips. Typos, poor illustrations. Maybe for $6 or $7. Women may get more out of it. But, if I can figure out that shoe tying description...nah...I'm sure I can find a better one on the web, probably with pictures."
5,Promising Book`,"This book has been well received at the International Children's Amputee Network Web site....There is a nice set of photos of how to tie shoes there, and discussion of this book. I'm glad this book is available."
1,Yet Another AWFUL Australian Comedy! They Do Make Lots Of These!,"This movie is terrible just like most Australian so called 'Comedies"". It is about two young girls who are enrolled in a school with one of them having aspirations to get a better education. Delta Goodrem once again proves that as an actress she is a bad singer and in this movie she looks terrible as a blonde' As she once sang""Out of the blue, I watched this movie It was awful too, Maybe get a refund from who?""."
2,Palm Protection OK - No Protection for Back and Sides of Hand,"The palm of this glove does provide protection against a hot pan, however the material of which the rest of the glove is made provides little or no protection for the rest of your hand. This lack of protection means bumping against an oven rack or anything else can cause a burn. This is not the level of protection I expect for kitchen work.Furthermore the bottom of the glove is very narrow which makes donning the gloves difficult."
1,burnt finger,"Today I tried these new gloves for the first time. I took out of the oven (425 degrees F) a nice foccacia on an aluminum sheet pan. The hot metal instantly (well, within a couple of seconds) burned my index finger, right through the glove's yellow Kevlar and gray leather overlay. No blister, but four hours later it's still tender. I'm giving the gloves to my daughter for summer garden work, where the temps usually stay below 100. I think she'll be safe."
5,A Masterwork which hasn't received the credit and attention it would deserve.,"Keith Jarrett reminds and illustrates with this CD how much Johann Sebastian Bach was influenced by Friedrich Handel. Keith Jarrett is able to capture the richness and mathematical perfection in this pieces as Glenn Gould is able to capture them for instance in Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations. I was surpiresed that Jarrett with his Jazz background was able to play this pieces in such a neio classical clarity. I actally expected the CD to have a Jazz influence like we have with Jaques Loussier when he plays pieces of Bach. As already mentioned, the pieces illustrate, how much Johann Sebastian Bach's music and clarity was influenced and inspired by Friedrich Handel. Keith Keith Jarrett proved to me that he is a great Pianist and this CD should earn him the appropiate respect which he deserves."
3,Fairly pleased,"Works well enough, but some of the controls are odd. For instance one button is used to turn on the tv (""TV""), while an entirely different one is used to turn it off (""Power""). Also, it is not very compatible with the RCA TV's that include the ""Guide Plus"" menu. There is no menu button, no exit button, and no guide button, so it is always interesting to try to clear the guide screen once the TV is turned on, and once it is cleared it is impossible to bring it back up with out turning the tv off then on again.I was able to find my signal well though and have not had any connectivity problems, so it does its job. Overall, I'd say it is as expected for an $8 remote and you would probably get your money's worth, especially if you don't have a guide menu or anything like that. Oh and a caveat, I did not try it with a DVD player or Cable box or anything like that, so I couldn't tell you how it works as far as those electronics go."
1,RCA Universal TV remote control,"As I have written before on this product..once again I will repeatmyself. The ""PRE CH"" does not work. This is a faulty product."
3,Messed Up Love,"This book is not that great. It is hard to get into a book if you don't really care for the main characters.The main character Dalton Moss is messed up. She is engaged to her boyfriend who lives back east, and sees another man who lives in L.A. who also has another serious girlfriend.Her fience comes off like an a-hole also because he gets mad when he finds out about Dalton's boy toy, but he also had something going on with his ex-girlfriend when they were working together in Africa.Also Dalton's friends are weird. Her friend Ava seems like a woman-child, probably due to the fact of her mob family and the step-mother almost the same age as she is who has sex with Ava's brother when their father is away. Her other friend Electra is as messed up as well."
5,Awesome!!!,I thought this book was GREAT!!! It was real and funny! Looking forward to the next one Ms. Amanda Hill!!
2,Boring,"This is another entry into the chick lit genre issued by Red Dress Ink.I am not sure what is up with this series lately, but I have not enjoyed any of their recent books and this one is no exception.I did not care for any of the characters and the whole storyline (the main character dating (secretly) two men is boring, boring, boring.The end was incredibly predictable and this was a total waste of money."
1,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled by the packaging of this DVD, or even the title menu itself. This is NOT the original Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers that so many of us know and love. This is the ALL NEW Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers. Needless to say, when I invited my friends over to watch the old movie in all its greatness, we were beyond disappointed. Don't make the same mistake I did. Only get this DVD if you really want the all new version. VERY dissapointing."
1,0 stars,"Like everyone else who was duped in hopes of landing the original masterpiece, I was grossly offended by this production, hosted by a blinged-out Marv Albert and an intolerable, swollen Frank Layden. This was intended to be a small surprise gift for a friend's wedding and, after viewing this piece of shit, he promptly defriended me."
1,False Advertising!,"This is not the Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers from 1989! This is the stupid sequel that for some reason has the exact same title. I only bought this for the slam dunk contest highlights, mainly the '88 Jordan highlights, but they are not here and from what I can find the original is not available on dvd!"
1,Not the real thing!,The reviews below are right! This is the sequel and not the original. I hope Warner will do something about this. Don't buy unless Warner released the original version.
2,"it's a shame that this stuff really happens, but ignoring it doesn't make it disappear","these guys don't play . . . not entertainment, but a decent information overview for parents and training film for teachers and cops, probation & parole."
1,"Please, don't waste your money on this garbage","You would really need to be out of your mind to throw your hard-earned money to the garbage by buying this. Unfortunately, i bought Vol. 1 last year and i have regreted it since then."
5,The Most Sacred on High-Truly Amazing..............,"I concur with the first reviewer about everything in this Box-Set, except the Lord Nelson-Mass, I find it superbly done. Arguably, the 6 Late Masses are the finest ever written. I can't think of another composer's Masses which are better, maybe Mozart or Beethoven, but neither have 6 as fine as Haydn. As for this set, I have listened to excrepts of the Gardiner set and this set seems much better. The soloists seem to sing exactly on cue and the music is perfectly synchronized. Good Luck finding a reasonably priced set. Found my set on the Amazon UK-site. At that time, the currency converison was much cheaper than the US price."
1,One word GARBAGE!,"Pure Garbage. Cheaply made. The insert is to narrow for the handle bar of mini bike, don't waste your money on it."
3,Smith,"This novel ""Smith"" by Leon Garfiel who is award winning author writes about a boy ,Smith,who has a trouble life.The story happen around the middle ages in Europe.

2,Logitech Support,"As far as it goes this is an excellent web ca. As a stand alone with flash the pictures have a tendency to be washed out. The display panel on mine failed after 3 monthes. Logitech sent me a replacement right away. However they down graded the camera to the Clicksmart 420 (worth 1/3 less). They said this is there policy on replacements. As long as your camera works, fine, if it fails then you have problems."
4,Great buy for the buck!!!,"By using the light enhancer in a dim room I was very impressed with the quality of video. I only used it once so far sending a video email to my friends and familly back home, but received many replies commenting on how well the picture and sound came out. Very impressive. The video I made may have sold a few more!!! The package when received was missing the memory card, however, the supplier was very responsive and helpful with their custmer service. I'm very happy with the product."
1,clicksmart 510,this camera was good for the first month of use.Anyone that wants to use this camera needs to know that it loves to feed on battery life. Mine just keeps on dying continously and i am finding it most imposabily to keep up .. If youre looking to obtain a fairly new Logitech ClickSmart unit.. look for it in the local dump .. i've now gone with the Sony unit that has 200 mins+ per 2 AA batteries!
2,NOT GOOD ON WINDOWS XP,"I am a huge logitech fan. However, I have to say this is the first logitech camera I am seriously diappointed with. I own the logitech Quickcam Traveller, Quickcam 3000, and this Clicksmart 510. All work great on XP except the Clicksmart 510.You can use the clicksmart for just about everything else but MSN Messenger. It freezes everytime within a min. or so. I have done a clean install of XP and still nothing. Finally wrote Microsoft, they say it's not compatible at all with MSN, and logitech still claims it is. I have another friend with same camera and same problem. Don't waste your money on this camera if you use XP. Any other OS, should work great if you like to use MSN messenger. Also, won't work with yahoo either. It freezes and gets errors. Hope you find this helpful."
4,Great Webcam,"I purchased this camera at a local electronics store....It was on sale for 99 bucks and for the price it was well worth it...As a webcam image quality is good, with smooth clear video which I like more than my Creative webcam. As a digital camera it's not quite as good, with images coming out so-so, but not terrible either. For the price you can't expect it to take the best looking pictures as a more expensive professional type digital camera would, also it is only 1.3 megapixels, but i'm happy with it and recommend it to beginners who want to buy a digital camera or someone looking for a good webcam and don't want to spend lots of cash."
3,Pretty good....if you CANNOT spend more than $150,"Picture quality is ok. Ease of use and webcam abilities are excellent. This is great if you cannot afford to spend $300+ on a real digital camera.So, 2 stars if you are expecting a good digital camera. 5 stars in the 'get what you pay for catagory'."
4,Good multi-use digital camera/webcam,"This camera is great for entry level use in digital photography, the pictures are of adequate quality. You can use it for 90 sec's of digital video as well and when attached to your computer acts as a webcam (great for family if you have high-speed internet access) Bottom line is, for (the price) don't expect much in quality of photos, but plenty of features."
1,ClickSmart - out of focus,"I bought this product mainly for the price, so I guess I should not be surprised by the quality it turns out. No matter where I set the lens to, my pictures are always out of focus."
2,Pelikan Pen,"Too light for its price. Good looking pen, but when you hold it in your hand, it feels like a 9.99 pen."
5,Very pretty,"I'm not finished with the cross stitch yet, but it's easy, so I don't anticipate a problem. It's very pretty, everything is included, and the material is good quality."
4,Two Hearts Wedding,"The contempary style is what I wanted for the couple I am stitching it for. The only problem I have with it is the needle, the eye is to small to get three strands of floss through."
4,Anniversary Gift,This was a 10th anniversary gift for my son & daughere-in-law. It was time consuming but turned out beautiful. They loved it.
1,Buyer beware: Does not work with Windows 7,"My son requested this game for his birthday. I wish I had known that it does not work under Windows 7. I've had to deal with the issue of StarForce Protection drivers on some other game CDs. In the past, I was able to update the StarForce driver so that it would work. This time, NOTHING I did would work. I am really good at computers and troubleshooting. I researched the problem on the Microsoft and StarForce websites. When nothing would work, I called technical support at Ubisoft. The customer service representative told me that this game does not work on Vista or Windows 7. I thought I would warn other unsuspecting customers before they lost their money."
1,BROTHERS IN ARMS EARNED IN BLOOD,"THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH THE FIFTY DOLLARS I SPENT ON IT. THE ACTION IS JERKY, SIGHTS ARE WAY OFF, INFO BOX'S POP UP AT THE WORST TIMES,ND IT TAKES SEVEN TO TEN ROUNDS TO KILL ONE GERMAN SOLDER. THE CARBINE IS USELESS AND THE YOU NEED A BAR OR MACHINE GUN TO STAND A CHANCE TO GET A HIT."
3,difficult game,takes quite a while to install..This game runs fine in windows xp..Do NOT try to run it in windows 7. If you do next boot windows 7 will no longer run. This is due to the anti-pirating software in the game. It is a difficult game but well written and the graphics are pretty good
5,Great Game,I liked it allot. I have played 2 of the set. Looking forward to playing Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway.
4,Nice Game-Loads Easily When Using DVD ROM Drives,"Brothers In Arms: Earned in Blood is a friendly game. It plays well on my old 1.5 GHz AMD machine with 512 MB of RAM using Windows 2000 Pro. I run it at 800x600 using an old ATI 9600XT graphics card with 128 MB of video RAM. It does take a bit more horsepower to run than Brothers In Arms: Road to Hill 30, only because of the better and more realistic graphics.You will enjoy it if you like nostalgic WWII games."
1,stay away,"if you have trouble adding 2+4+6+7, and need to be spoon fed every single idea, possibly this book is for youimo, it is everything that is wrong with pedagogy and textbooks in this country; the simplified powerpoint like style; the discursive prolix writing; ideas explained backwards, even the large page format, whichmakes it difficult to READ...ughyou want to know why text books have such outlandish price tags ?just look at all the superfluous stuff in this onetry Feedman Pisani and Purves, 4th ed; you will be a lot happier"
2,Review of Stats,"In OK condition, it has writing in it and its clearly an older book. It serves the purpose."
4,Happy Customer,Item was in very good condition and arrived quickly. I was very pleased with this purchase.
2,"HALF THE SEASON, SELECTED EPISODES",JUST AS MY TITLE STATES IT IS NOT EVEN THE FULL FIRST SEASON. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PURCHASE. OK
4,Time for go to bed...,"Somehow I don't think I should be laughing at Tor Johnson. After all, it wasn't entirely his fault that he is a big block of muscle with a far-off look in his eye and no acting talent evident. But knowing that doesn't stop me from laughing paralyzingly hard at every joke they make at Tor's expense. Equally terrific is John Carradine's organ playing (to which Tom Servo shouts ""One more time"" after the 15-minute piece is completed), the treatment of the mysteriously twitching resident in the basement (the penguin noises threw me into hysterics). The jokes start to lose steam as the movie wanders into a bland conclusion, but anyone who wants to admire the finest work making fun of a non-actor this side of ""Mitchell"" and ""Eegah"" should enjoy this. Also, read the ""Van Damme"" section of Mike Nelson's book for more slab-o-non-talent delights."
2,"Some good, some bad.","Greetings from Tromaville!The opening two PSA's are hilarious, but the feature is so dull(even with The MST3K Posse), that I take away three stars. Buy it if it's the final MST3K video you need for your collection."
4,Time For Go To Bed!,"I'm a big MST3K fan, but I admit this one had to grow on me a bit, but I love it now. Tor Johnson is obviously amazing as always and he carries the film. Either way it is worth it for the shorts at the beginning. Posture Pals and Appreciating Your Parents are two of the best. Could you be one of the Posture Posse? Think about it won't you? Push the Button Frank!"
5,Miss Whiting is White Hot!,"I really enjoyed this cd. A great selection of favorites and some never-heards. I'm usually a little apprehensive about any compiliation type collections, but this really hits the nail on the head. Two discs, 45 titles...you can't go wrong. ""My Foolish Heart"" is of course a favorite, but I never, ever get tired of hearing it."
5,NO ONE SINGS BETTER,"WHAT A SINGER! WONDERFUL CLEAR VOICE, PERFECT DICTION, WARM INTERPRETATIONS. MAGGIE CAN SING IN A WHISPER, STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG WITH GLORIOUS LOW NOTES, OR IN FULL VOICE, BELTING OUT WITH THE LUSTIEST OF ORCHESTRATIONS. LISTEN TO HER WONDERFUL RENDITION OF Come Rain or Come Shine AND HER FULL-VOICED RENDITION OF Why Don't You Believe Me? MARGARET WHITING SINGS THEM ALL THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE SUNG. I DISAGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER OF THIS CD RELEASE THAT JO STAFFORD WAS MORE EMOTIONAL AND HAD A SEXIER SOUND THAN MARGARET WHITING. I THINK IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE. STAFFORD'S VOICE WAS VERY CLEAR, BUT COLD. MAGGIE IS A SINGER'S SINGER AND A WINNER!"
1,packaging poor,"The electric razor was packaged in a box about 12x12x12 with one sheet of bubble rap and most of the bubbles were broken, this product could have easily been damaged upon shipping. Also the razor was advertised as new but when I got it the back was cut open. Would not do business with this seller again."
3,It is a Help Book!,"This book is focusing mainly on the theory side of the program i.e. discussing what each tool; pallet, menu, etc can do for you. However, the book is missing the important side, which is the practical side i.e. tutorials, projects, etc.Talking generally, as a beginner to InDesign i did benefit from understanding what the tool can do for me, but I dono how, where and when to use it.I think this book can serve as a reference (OR HELP BOOK)."

3,suspect trail rating system,"This is a good book as far as informing you where the trails along the front-range are. However, his rating system is suspect. First off you just can't rate mountain biking trails with 3 tires, and this fool thinks every trail is simple. Beginners beware some of the trails he rates as easy are pretty darn hard. 3 stars because the direction to the trail heads is excellent."
4,Very Fun Christian Music!,"Billie Crockett has a number of light-hearted Christian Songs on this album. My personal favorite is ""The Wake up Song"" which is a fantastic song to brighten your morning and put a smile on your face. I also enjoyed ""41 Lawnmowers"" and many others, which use lighthearted words to make you think about serious issues in the life of Christians. The only problem I find with the album is that it is a ""live"" album - and the background noise can be somewhat distracting at times. However, if that doesn't bother you, the album gives a good variety of Billy Crockett's best songs."
5,Best live album I've heard,"Billy doesn't get to your town much or at all? Me neither. But this album is the cure! It has more of a ""you are there"" feel than any other live album I've heard. It also has several songs that are only on out-of-print studio albums, too. All that, plus the recitation of ""The Crockosaurus"", add up to a must-have for any fan of Billy's music."
4,ball teara of a book,"Still working my way through this great book. Learnt a lot from it. Lovely prose style that makes it easy to read with out patronising me. I would not have guesed he's a neocon (according to his Wikpaedia entry. Had not heard of this book before reading about it on AMAZON, so was ignorent of the impact it had after 9/11. Recomended to any history buffs."
4,"Good, but a little repetitous","I enjoyed this book. It is well-written and literate. It makes a good companion (or counterpoint) to Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Steel, and Bacteria"" -- successfully persuading me that more than early environmental factors account for the rise and continued material success of Western cultures vizaviz other cultures. I'm not as convinced by the book's central premise -- that the success of the West on battlefields is accounted for by its origins in the Greek polity of ancient Athens. OK, so it may be to some extent true. But, by the end of the book, I found myself positively irritated by the number of times this had been offered as a reason for everything. Also, the chapter on Viet Nam made me want to gargle with a good clarifying mouth wash: yuck! That said, the actual battle descriptions make engaging and thrilling reading."
3,doesn't hold up,"Exciting, and the thesis is alluring and thought provoking. As you go through it, however, it is less appealing, the logic has a lot of holes, and one tires of the didactic presentation.Interesting, but that was it for me..."
1,Western Triumphalism,"This book is pure nonsense. There is no such thing as ""Western Civilization,"" and the notion of the West as opposed to the East is pure fabrication. What is exhibited here is ideological Euro-American cultural triumphalism. The battles may be wonderfully described, but the organizing thesis that there is a Western manner of warfare, and it reflects Western cultural values is pure fiction..."
3,Hanson was far better in is precedent book,"""Carnage and Culture"" by Victor Davis Hanson is an answer-book to Jared Diamond's ""Guns, germs and steel"" : if the UCLA's biologist explicated the western supremacy of the world with environmental and naturalistic causes, the historian from Fresno explicated with military reasons ; the West won cause he introduced a new way to warfare(this idea is not original at all, but was introduced by John Keegan).This is a two-faces book : Hanson is good, often wonderful, when he describe battles and their horrors, is disputable when he express his ideology, sometimes ridiculous : English soldier of the XIX century was better than Zulu warrior only for gun, not for liberalism. Hanson was far more convincing in his precedent book ""The Western Way of War"", dedicated only to ancient Greece.How many stars ? It depends from your political view : one if you're radical, two if you're liberal, three if you're moderate, four if you're conservative..."
5,one of the most well writen military history books i've read,this book by hanson is a masterpiece the way that he shows the evolution of the western way of warfare and the way that their culture has made them vertually unstoppable and the way that hanson shpws this without being preachy and rude and too opinionated he just displays the facts and the truth is so obvious. this book is a must read for anybody that likes military history !!!!!
1,Another book about the supposed marvels of the Greeks,"Carnage and Culture reworks the tired old thesis (so common in histories about the ""Rise of the West"") that the global dominance of the West in modern times can be traced, in a linear fashion, to the Greeks. Not a surprising thesis for a Classicist, but one that is untenable nevertheless. Despite the fact that this book is about the rise of the West (which did not occur until the 16th century), nearly half the book is about the classical world. Moreover, the decisive battles which created the global empires of the 19th century are almost entirely overlooked (with a nod to the Zulu War), as are the wars of decolonization in the latter part of the 20th century. What about the Battle of Plassey? The Opium War? The War of the Golden Stool? An interesting military history, but not the claimed bill of goods."
4,A must read for historical warfare fans !,Definitely worth reading if you like military history ! Very well written and easy to follow ... just found it slightly repetitive in terms of the ideas which he wanted to put across. If you're a warfare fan don't miss out on this book !
4,Interesting view on Western warfare,"The book gets a bit repetitve, but overall is a very interesting viewpoint on why the West wins wars. What is interesting is that it differs from most similar attempts, such as Kennedy's Rise and Fall of teh Great Powers and others in the primary view that economics wins. While true, Hanson ties the success of the West to not only technology or economics, but stresses the importance of intangibles like discipline, organization, and focus on complete victory.If you liked books like Rise and Fall, this will be an easier and wirthwhile read. This is not a story-telling history book in the model of Stephen Ambrose, etc. But, very well written and willing to focus on the wins and losses in Western military history."
4,Eye-opening,"Before I read this book, I always assumed the dominance of the West was due to some luck; quick to use firearms, a few good generals etc. This book shows how important free markets, free minds, and liberty are in waging war and maintaining power. Magnificent book."
5,an excellent book,Hanson does an excellent job of illustrating the cultural and philosophical basis of western military dominance. His style is both very readable and scholarly. He falls in a tradition of such greats as Werner Jaeger et al. This is a wonderful and much needed treatment of a fascinating philosophical problem. It runs counter to the superficial accepted PC version of reality and is very refreshing.
5,Everything advertised and more,"I've heard that Victor Davis Hanson's books were good, but this is the first one that I've read. It is everything advertised and more. The basic thesis is that culture is a major input of success in war and that the ingredients of Western culture have been the most successful since the Greeks of about 5th-century B.C. In examining a series of nine battles, from Salamis to Tet, Hanson firmly makes his case.The bonus is that he makes this book so fascinating. I've never been interested in reading about ancient battles, but Hanson brings the participants and events alive. This is that relatively rare non-fiction book that I could not put down."
5,Fifty-One Pages of Viet Nam,"This is a superb book for anyone who wants to learn more about military history. Mr. Hanson offers a very clear view on how he sees Western culture and its effect on history. I recommend several of his other books that I have read.The primary point of my review is that EVERYONE in the United States should read the 51 pages of this book devoted to the Viet Nam war. Every myth is demolished, every pseudo-historical lie is rebutted. and all lessons learned are clearly laid out."
4,Time marches on,"I found the book quite interesting and readable, but I felt that the author was fairly ethnocentric at times. I also felt that as the book progressed, Hanson became less and less objective and more inclined to include his own personal feeling about morality and politics (compare the tone of the Tet Offensive chapter with that of Salamis).All that notwithstanding, I find that Hanson is good at emphasizing his point (many many many times) and would gladly buy another of his books.Interestingly, reading this has given me an interest in reading Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" to compare and contrast the 2 books.As an impulse buy, I was very satisfied and have developed a burgeoning interest in military history."
4,From what I've read so far...,I'm about half way through the book and so far it seems very well thought out. My biggest complaint is how Salamis is glorified and Thermopylae's contribution to the Greek defense is downplayed to a ridiculous extent. Overall Carnage and Culture is a very well thought out book that explains Western military dominance.
3,"Some sticks, some doesn't","Ugh, it's the spaghetti strategy applied to military history! Hanson throws so much stuff on the wall that some of it is bound to stick. The problem is that some of the sticky stuff is excellent (indeed, bordering on brilliant), while some is just plain wrong (indeed, foolishly and demonstrably so). The entire project is guided by a conservative ""reclaiming the west"" motif that will make Hanson a darling of everyone from William Bennett and Pat Buchanan to Lynn Cheney and Diane Ravitch. It's a shame, because the book is extremely readable without the righist diatribes, which can only make cringe those without an ideological axe to grind."
5,Alice,I loved this version when I first saw it on tv. I still do. Thank you folks at Amizon for helping to build my Library. Your tops
4,Just like I remembered,This version of Alice in Wonderland is just like I remembered! This was the one I watched as a child and I was thrilled to see it on Amazon. Great movie!
5,Alice,"Great video, a favorite of our family since it aired on TV. I got copies for my daughters (age 26 and 29) and they were delighted. Much better quality than the old VHS tape recording of the TV airing and both ""Alice in Wonderland "" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" are included."
5,a true gem...,"This is my favorite version of Alice in Wonderland, and I haven't been able to see it in years since Blockbuster decided to get rid of its entire VHS section and not bother replacing it with any DVDs. I'm so happy this includes both parts of the story. For those of you who are only familiar with the Disney version, you are in for a real treat!! Especially when Alice is on the wrong side of the looking glass.. with the Jabberwocky!"
5,Reliving a childhood memory,I was thrilled to see this movie out on DVD. I had been renting every single version of Alice in Wonderland off of NetFlix trying to find the 1985 TV version that I so clearly remembered. I bought a copy for all of my girlfriends that used to come over to my parent's house to watch it when we were 7. The cast of characters that perform are far better than the newest made for TV versions AND it is funny to see some of them again. The music is infectious. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in made for TV movies or Alice in Wonderland/Thru the Looking Glass.
5,Brilliant film!,"Brilliant film. I have Alice in Wonderland taped on video and i have been looking for Alice Through the Looking Glass for a long time. While watching it last week, I discovered that Part 2 is also on it, so I saw that for the first time the other day. What can i say? Brilliant acting from the whole cast, especially Natalie Gregory who plays Alice. i recommend it to anyone. Children and adults would love it."
2,a minority opinion,"I'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia. I had not seen this movie as a child; those that say it's faithful to the book must have read something other than Lewis Carroll's Alice. However, the kitsch value is considerable; cheezy music and costumes, pure 1985. That being said, the Jabberwock was pretty cool in that ""Godzilla-man-in-the-rubber-suit"" sort of way. Also, the set design was very handsome. It's too bad that the lighting technology of the time couldn't have been more varied; everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional. The film that comes closest to Tenniel's original Alice illustrations is the 1933 Paramount b & w version; it's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on Turner Classics."
1,Kids didn't like it,"I remember watching the TV version of Alice in Wonderland starring Fiona Fullerton as a child which I thought was excellent. Unfortunately, all the reviews for that version stated that the quality was so bad that it wasn't worth it to buy the DVD. After looking at the different versions of ""Alice in Wonderland"" that Amazon had for sale, I decided to buy this one. Unfortunatley, after about 15 minutes into the movie my two children ages 12 and 7 both wanted to stop watching and quite frankly I agreed with them. The kids stated that it was just too ""weird"" and I happen to agree with their opinion."
1,Hollywood Square Hell,"Wholly cow! This thing's earned a five-star rating here!?!? I bought this as joke because I remember what a riot it was in 85. Boy, it just shows how widely people differ in taste. The musical numbers are just putrid, and about half of the has-been, Show-biz cast always looks grieved to be wearing those community-theatre-quality costumes. Maybe if ya were a kid when this came out, or had a small kid ya get some warn fuzzes off it, but I think it's schlock at it's schlockiest."
4,Amazing cast of stars from the 80's....gives life to Alice in Wonderland,"If you liked Irwin Allen stuff like lost in space, you should love this versionof Alice in Wonderland. What we have here is a nice little tale, without cgi, asall actors are dressed up for their characters. The big big bonus for this movieis that we have a boatload of actors/actresses from the tv land of the 80's doingone role or another. Its like seeing your friends again...even if most of themare now gone.This movie is split into 2 parts...so after the end credits of the first part,just wait and the second part will eventually start.Once again, i really loved this movie cause it has lots of memories and it wasgreat to see Telly Savalas as the C. Cat. I do miss his smile and acting.Enjoyable movie..and a keeper of course."
4,Childhood Memories,"I bought this movie because my brother and I were remembering it from our childhood. We had recorded it off of the TV when it originally aired. We loved it and wanted our kids to have a chance to see it, too. The songs are great and you'll love picking out all the old celebrities like Ringo Starr, Sammy Davis, Jr. and many more. Keep in mind that it was made for TV so the screen goes black whenever there is supposed to be a commercial break and it aired in two nights so the opening and closing credits run twice. It includes Alice in Wonderland (pt. 1) and Through the Looking Glass (pt. 2). The special effects were great in 1985, though a little cheesy to watch as an adult 25 years later. The Jabberwocky (who appears periodically in the second half) may still frighten young sensitive children. Over all it was a great movie and my 5yr. old son liked it enough that he wanted his other cousins to have a chance to see it, too."
5,Memories!,"I was so excited to get this video. It was one of my favorites as a kid, and now I get to share it with my niece!It was great! Perfect condition.. So THANK YOU to the SELLER!!! A whole new generation is going to enjoy it now!"
3,Loved this as a kid!,"I love this movie, brings back great memories from childhood! Just wish they would remaster it or something. We're spoiled with the quality of kids movies now. ;) The cast is incredible. I'd say it's ok for ages 8+ because some of the characters are scary. Lots of fun though!"
3,???,I remeber this movie being so much better when I was little. but it was nice to see again and it will be ice to show to the kids.
5,do your self a favour and see this movie,"This is without a doubt the greatest version of Alice in Wonderland ever. I used to watch it as a child and surprise surprise my copy was taped over. After years of searching i'd given up looking for a copy and when someone suggested I try amazon i didn't actually expect to find it here. When i found it here I thought i might explode with joy and excitment. Even though it isn't available in Australian format however i'm bying it anyway and having it transformed, expensive but highly worth it. Overall this is costing me around $150 australian dollars. I would pay 1000 times more just to see this one more time. Outstanding cast and crew the greatest version ever. This can't even be compared to the 1999 version."
2,Please ! Read the Book,"So much is lost in the attempt to make a movie of this book. What is nonsensical yet delightful comes off as silly in the translation. I cannot warm to Irwin Allen's production of ""Alice"" despite the very good performance of Natalie Gregory, the movie never really gets off the ground. The various stars are not at their best in their roles and actually seem miscast in many instances. I am inclined to blame the director as the comedians and actors all are talented individuals apparently not allowed to actually get into their characters. And the songs penned by Steve Allen are mediocre at best and embarrassing at worst. A shame and a waste. My advice, read the book and let your imagination do the rest. Lewis Carroll does not need Irwin Allen and neither do you."
3,Half a movie,"Well, I was happy to find this movie on Amazon and even more excited upon receiving it in the mail. HOwever, when I watched it, I noticed the movie only went up to a certain point that I don't remember being the ending. So, I kinda feel I got half a movie. :/ I even turned the disc over to see if maybe it was a double sided disc but that also didn't work."
5,Alice in Wonderland DVD,"I recently purchased the 1985 Alice in Wonderland with the second part Through the Looking Glass on DVD. I have watched it and it plays great. I also love that I finally found it on DVD and did not have to resort to buying two VHS tapes separately on eBay somewhere. I hadn't seen this movie since I was very little and it was such a treat to see again! I always remembered a few little parts growing up and it took me a long time to track down which version I was remembering. It is a musical that ran on TV with many singers and actors from the 80s. I admit that now that I'm an adult, I do fast forward some of the songs. I was happy to see the scenes of the movie that I had remembered for so long. The jabberwocky was just as scary as I remembered! Overall, I am very satisfied with the whole buying cycle and the product. This is a great version of Alice in Wonderland for any child."
5,Alice!,"My family has this movie, recorded on VHS, from it's original airing in 1985... As you can imagine, it's pretty beaten up. Now, we can share it with the entire next generation growing up!"
5,WOW!!,"This movie is EXCELLENT!!! I HIGHLY recommend it. My kids are transfixed, and there is nothing objectionable. WONDERFUL movie!"
4,"Mini-series Enjoyable and Tuneful Version of ""Alice""","Of the many, many versions of the classic story this is one of the better ones! Natalie Gregory is a charming Alice and the songs by Steve Allen leave you humming. This video and ""Alice Through the Looking Glass""- which were shown together as a TV mini-series- play a little fast-and-loose with the original story (as most adaptations do)but the music, guest stars, and little Natalie make both of these videos fine for the whole family!"
4,Great to have on DVD,"Just so it is clear for others considering purchasing this DVD - it DOES have both Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. It is on one disc which is nice so that you don't have to get up to change the disc. I remember watching this when I was very small and I enjoy it just as much as an adult as I did as a child. It gives a great spread of stars (if you remember them), and entertaining songs. The special effects are from the 80's so it's very funny to watch now. This is another one of those things that you're either a die hard fan of, or not. I don't think adults would really be into it if you hadn't seen it as a child."
5,Life-long favorite!,"Since I was 8 years old, I have been in love with the 1985 Harry Harris's ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" The music and song lyrics have haunted my mind with only good memories throughout the years! Even though I am 28 years old (will be 29 this year), I still love this movie.I have to congratulate Harry Harris for his wonderful directing skills and the music composers for the beautiful music! I also thought that Natalie Gregory had the most beautiful singing voice, so I tried to sing like her! Thanks to Natalie, I had taken singing lessons. I am now a pianist, singer, songwriter, and actress, and it is all because of the motivation from this movie!"
5,YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I'VE WAITED FOR THIS!!,"OMG! THIS HAS REALLY MADE MY AUGUST!THIS IS THE BEST ADAPTATION OF THIS STORY EVER DONE, EVER! I THOUGHT EVENTUALLY I'D JUST HAVE TO PURCHASE THE VHS TAPES, JUST SO I COULD OWN THIS. FINALLY! YIPPEE!!THANK YOU SONY FOR FINALLY RELEASING THIS CLASSIC TREASURE AND ON TOP OF IT THE PRICE IS OUTSTANDING.. THANK YOU AGAIN!!"
4,"Ahh, the good ole` days!","I remember watching this as a small child and loving it to death! I recently had a hanker`in to watch it again so i found i here and loved it! I've watched it 2000 times since I bought it and it is the greatest thing ever! When I was small I never realized what a star-studded cast was in it but now I look back and these are some of the most famous people of their time. I remember watching the Jam song, sung by Carol Channing, and my mom would always scream at me because she couldn't stand it!"
5,Alice In Wonderland DVD,"I have been looking for this for years!! It was own of my favorite tapes when I was a child! As always, Amazon makes it possible for me to find just about anything I want for a lower price than anywhere else! Thanks Amazon!"
4,missing links,"I was extactic to find this movie! Once recieved i viewed it immediately to find that there were very many missing pieces to a puzzle that once was full. The lion and the unicorn were missing as well as phyllis dillard and the jam song. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum were absent, and the singing flowers were a now show. In fact, the clip that is on the back of the case is not even in the movie. In my opinion, the entire story line was changed just by editting these few and important pieces of the movie. It didnt even end the same..i was very dissappointed!"
5,Very Excited!,Okay I actually just ordered this and have not received the product but not worried have bought tons from Amazon! I watched this when I was very little and have a daughter now and have always wanted her to see it! Thought it was interesting that they have not played on TV for a very long time as this is the best Alice in Wonderland every made! If you have not seen this version I recommend 100%!
4,Great Childhood Classic!,I am so glad I was able to find this product on DVD!I had seen this movie as a kid and always wanted to get my own copy.Very happy with product and highly recommend to others who remember it from their childhood days
5,Wonderful Trip Down Memory Lane,"I was pleasantly surprised at the up-dated quality of the video itself. Sure enough, it actually DOES have both the first and second movies on the one disk. It operated wonderfully, even in my cheap dvd player, and I was able to use the closed captions from my tv so I didn't miss one crazy name or word! The whole experience was exactly what I had pictured for strolling back to my childhood."
4,Alice,"I have loved this version of Alice in Wonderland since I first saw it! I can't believe I actually found it! I only had one problem and it wasn't Amazon's fault...I paid extra for UPS shipping, and UPS gave it to the post office. I was not happy about that. If I had wanted to recieve it in the mail I would have paid USPS shipping, it was cheaper."
5,"Great cast, and fun to watch","Enjoyed this thoroughly. Great all star cast. Movie is in 2 parts (about 90 minutes each part). Enjoyable, funny and good for adults."
5,PERFECT!!,Swear I have already reviewed this but it says not... sooo... it was in fantastic condition and played perfectly and did have both parts on the dvd. It was unclear in the description if both parts were indeed on the dvd (might be something to make clear)... I LOVED this movie as a little girl and was thrilled to watch it again and share it with mycildren.... THANK YOU!
5,Cant believe I found this!!!,My grandparents videotaped this on a cassette for me and my sister when we were young. The quality was fair for the time. With all the moves the tape was lost but I always remembered this version. When I read the book I realized how closely this mini series came to the actual book. Love! Love! Love!
5,speechless!,"omg I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie online, I absolutely adore it!! also, I was shocked to see how many others loved this film as well - no one has ever known what i was talking about! aahhhh, words cannot describe how awesome this movie is..so creative and different from the other versions. and i completely agree with the person who left the comment about how there should be a soundtrack! sure it may be an old movie, and we've all become adults, but there's still that 8 year old version of us inside that's dying to sing to these oh-so-catchy songs hahah."
4,Tried for years to find this!!,For years i told my friends about an Alice in Wonderland movie where Alice is chased around by a dragon thing. I remembered that it was very frightening to me when i was five. I bought it and suddenly i had proof...that movie really did exsist. It is exactly the way i remember it...It is incredible (if a little campy...but what do you really expect?) and its still fun to watch even as a 23 year old. What a treat!
3,Interesting,"I got this because my husband went to school with Rick Rubin and was good friends with him then. He found it interesting, course, Rick doesn't keep in touch and I think he isn't a very nice person. My hubbie keeps in touch with all his old high school friends and Rick was one of his closest. But, Rick's loss."
5,Great book!,"This has got to be one of my favorite books, along with the two previous ones in the triology. The action is great, the characters are real, and it manages to be both serious and funny at times. A marvelous adaptation of Arthurian legend. Read it!"
2,it's a downer!,"I was looking forward to this Vanilla tea and the Mango-Peach-Pineapple. VERY Disappointed. No flavor all with either one. The Sweet and Spicy I ordered has flavor and it's tasty, but the other 2 are not worth the money!! Don't waste your money on the Vanilla or the Mango Peach & Pineapple ones. Stick to the sweet and spicy. I'm very upset because I bought several boxes of each and I can't even drink it!!"
1,Has an artificial vanilla flavor,Sorry but I was looking for a nice madagascar vanilla smooth tea and this one had a very artificial flavor and the smell of it is very unpleasant.
5,my favority tea,this is my daily tea. it's not bitter at all if you use water that is just steaming no need to boil. tastier than green tea and just as good for you.
1,Eat crow much?,I have read many reviews by people who mock people who say that the sky is falling. Guess what: the sky fell.
1,A mediocre amateur vocal group,"Speaking from a wide exposure to many top-quality professional vocal groups, the ""New Vocal Collective"" is composed of obviously amateur singers lacking good vocal technique directed with mediocrity. The actual pieces performed include some of my most favorite vocal arrangements and compositions (the reason for my purchase of the CD). Unfortunately, the renditions on the CD don't exhibit the brilliance, beauty and originality inherent in the scores.If you're going to support an amateur vocal ensemble with the purchase of a CD, or if you're just looking for great singing, there are dozens of top-quality groups out there that are much more deserving of your monetary support."
4,interesting context,"For someone who already knows about Genie, this doesn't add much to the story. It fills in some of the mundane details about daily life, but nothing remarkable. However, the book is good at providing context: the mindset of the research community, the Chomskian ideas being tested, and the academic politics that shaped the research on Genie -- and that shaped her life during this brief period that we know about."
2,Genie,"In 1970 at the age of 13, Genie was discovered by social services in California. Strapped to a potty chair, she was raised in social isolation, hidden away from the world. When discovered she was emaciated, malnourished and had little, if any, speaking skills. Scientists immediately flocked around Genie, wanting to study her. For four years she lived with one of the scientists, until funding dried up and he dumped her into state foster care. This book provides a chronology of the scientists who studied her, the science of linguistics and Genie's story.Overall, I was not impressed by the authors writing style. It was often boring and uninteresting. The author spoke at length about the science of linguistics and provided countless information about the scientists. I wanted to learn about Genie, not necessarily the science of linguistics and the scientists who mistreated her. I felt that the author also treated Genie as an object rather than as a person."
5,Videos purchased in Europe don't work on American VCR's,"Unfortunatly, Europe uses a different format (PAL) for VHF video than we use in the US. I would not use the review above to gauge whether or not to buy this video if you are purchasing it in the US. Even though I have not seen the video, I am giving it 5 stars (because I'm forced to choose) to offset the negative review above."
1,Never got to see the video. Very dissappointed,"I purchased this video back in 1999 when I was visiting on the Island of Ischia. Unfortunately when I returned back to the states I could not get the video to work on any vcr. I am not sure if their tapes and equipment are different than ours here in the states. If your tapes can be played on our equipment here in the states I would be interested in purchasing 2 of the video's. Thank you, Denise Dambra"
2,Markers arrived with two dried out,"Two of the markers were completely dried out when they arrived. It's hardly worth returning a package of markers, but my daughter is an art nut and she was really disappointed that 2 of the 5 were unusable."
4,Helpfulf for advanced students or those living in Japan,"This book gives a number of formulaic sentences for covering situations in the workplace or while entertaining, such as appropriate ways to congratulate someone for a promotion, express sympathy for a loss, commiserate while visiting someone in the hospital, apologize for a guest having to witness a domestic scene. Each sentence has a lenghty commentary describing its apporpriate use. This would be very helpful for an advanced student living in Japan. However, beginners can't use it very well."
2,VERY BASIC.,"HAS NO FEATURES AT ALL.,DISPLAY IS FADED AND HARD TO READ.WELL BUILT AND STURDY.I USED WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA TO GEOTAG."
1,Too fragile,"I bought this item for Chrismas and by march it stopped working, after a change of batteries. Because it was more than 30 days after purchase, the item is not returnable, so now I have a $100 electronic paper weight."
3,Poor form: a built-in EULA upon bootup,"Warning: the first thing this unit does upon boot is force the user to read and agree to a EULA (End User License Agreement) before being able to use the unit. Some people may not care, but I do."
2,Limited use,"I got this last summer to do hunting in the national forest(texas) and it really is nothing more than a fancy electroniccompass. The trackings and routes are nice, and it has evaluation.Eats battery like a starved dog.This was my first GPS .. and it died after light use .. 8 months.Maybe a dozen weekends. The keyboard buttons barely respond anymore.It has no abilities to connect to a computer and up/downloadmap savings either ... The more you use your GPS unit, you willlikely expect that functionality.Or maybe not !"
2,Great (For a while...),"This is a pretty nice unit, especially for the price. Liked it, good back lighting, good documentation, reasonable controls, etc..Only problem is that it would power back up in a pristine state, loosing all my waypoints, options, etc. I held for 30 minutes on Magellan TS phone support, and the website wanted too much personal information for on-line support (for my tastes at least).So, I'll return it and try a different brand. If this unit wasn't defective however, I would have been a pretty happy customer (hence the 2 stars.)"
2,100 No longer supported by Magellan,"My eXplorist 100 is only 4 months old and is defective. It's been treated very carefully but it will randomly clear the screen, lose the satellites and now is clearing all data... very frustrating.When I contacted the company, they say it's no longer supported and they won't repair it or honor the warranty (they are offering some sort of trade up, but I can't find out what the offer is yet as they say the phone system is having 'technical difficulties').So I loved the 100's price and features, but if you buy it, realize that if there is any issue, you are on your own."
4,Good product.,I thought it was a good product for the money. I found it cheaper here than anywhere else. We wanted it for geocaching. It is not a product to put in your car to tell you to turn left at the next street. We have used it on a couple geocaching excursions and loved it. It was worth the money for the fun it has given us. I would buy it again.
2,Inaccurate and no support,I really like everything about this unit except for the lack of accuracy mine exhibits.1) At sea on a 23 foot boat the GPS read (in 3-D positioning) that I was 109 Ft above sea level.2)When hiking it often shows my return track many many many yards off of where it actually IS. Like on another side of a river...3) Called Magellen and got absolutely NO assistance.I do have friends who have the same model and theirs work great...I just got a lemon.
3,Creepy!,"This sturdy little book has six pre-cut stencils. The designs are a good size for projects, and are easy enough that kids can handle them, but detailed enough to delight adults. I've used them to decorate windows and party bags and cards. The insects presented here are a butterfly, a honeybee, a praying mantis, a housefly, a beetle, and a dragonfly."
3,Mediocre performance,"Competent performance, but light on interpretation compared to otherCole Porter jazz interpretations I have heard. OK for light listening but it will stay on my shelf for the most part."
4,naturopathy for the 21st century,"this book is very informative and an easy read. can be a little wordy at times though, The book arrived in amazing condition for the price I paid. I love Amazon for their fast and effective service."
4,70-Plus Minutes of Essential Chapin,"Essentials gives you 12 self-penned songs from one of popular musics great storytellers and humanitarians. While Chapin had only four bona fide hits, you get a generous sampling of key album tracks and concert favorites. [The only glaring omission is ""Circle.""] Unlike other releases in The Essentials series which all limit song selection to 12 tracks and consequently a relatively short playing time, with tracks like ""Sniper"" (9:57) and ""30,000 Pounds of Bananas"" (10:58), you get over 70 minutes of music. RECOMMENDED"
3,It's What's Missing,"Minus two stars for not including Harry's two best storytelling gems: 30,000 Pounds of Bananas & Six String Orchestra. Some gold is on the surface. Some gold is buried, and sadly overlooked."
1,Unlistenable,"Sorry Harry but your songs did not age well at all. Taxi is the only thing here worth listening to. W*O*L*D could be the worst song of all time. Wow, can't believe how bad this is. Avoid this mess."
5,Harry Chapin....yes!,"The EssentialsThis is a collection of Harry Chapin's top songs. I'm an avid Harry Chapin fan. After listening to the CD, you won't be able to get Taxi out of your head just like you couldn't when you first heard it. Go, Harry, go. We need more new singers like you!"
2,Not quite pleased,I thought the cd was going to be studio versions of the songs. Instead it is live versions that do not sound well. You can barely hear Chapin sing. Not quite pleased with this purchase.
4,Very Enlightening!,I have to say that this book has definitely expanded my knowledge and view of many things written in the bible. The middle section of the book I did not find of much interest so I skipped over it but overall I have acquired a different outlook on many things mentioned in the Bible.
4,This Geiger's clicking like crazy,"Meet Teddy Geiger, the talented, model-cute 17 year old singer/songwriter whose debut album is a sure-fire bet to be a huge hit. Fans of James Blunt, Daniel Powter, Daniel Bedingfield and K T Tunstall will identify with this album, especially the fresh-sounding first single ""For You I Will (Confidence)""Second single ""These Walls"" is a ballad about facing up to life after having your heart broken.""Cause everybody tries to put some love on the lineAnd everybody feels a broken heart sometimesAnd even when I'm scared I have to try to flySometimes I fallBut I've seen it done beforeI got to step outside these walls""Other good tracks are ""Thinking Underage"", ""Look Where We Are Now"" and ""Seven Days Without You"" (a version of the Avion single, and my favorite track), but there really isn't a bad song on this album.Watch out for this husky voiced cutie-pie, he's another Geiger you can count on.Amanda Richards, March 31, 2006"
4,Yet Another Mayer Wannabe....,"One listen and look at Teddy Geiger and the first thing that comes to mind is John Mayer. I had never heard of the kid before CBS' ""Love Monkey"" (which WAS a good show, thank you very much), and immediately downloaded some of his tracks off CBS' website after each show's airing. People can argue, and rightfully so, that Geiger is just another in a long line of acoustic guitar-playing songwriters. However, with this much talent at his young age, it won't be too long before he's in the same class as Mayer, Tolcher, and Broussard."
5,Amazing Start To A Promising Career,"I just bought this CD about a week ago and I LOVE IT. He sounds like a mix between Gavin DeGraw, Matthew Nathanson, Michael Buble, and even more artists like them. This guy's a keeper. He has the best qualities of jazz-y artists, combined into music written from his heart and beautiful guitar work. It just makes you feel like you're in a coffee shop. AND HE'S ONLY 16. I'm amazed. You have to hear this for yourself for you to truly grasp what I'm saying. Keep in mind I'm listening to this CD right now; it's incredibly soothing and catchy.Don't be like one of my friends and compare to him to Jesse McCartney, because that's far from the truth. Teddy Geiger is for real. His raspy voice makes him sound mature for his age and there's not the typical sign of teen angst in there. It's deeper than most younger artists you hear, so give this CD a try if you like true-to-your-heart music that's acoustically driven and not just for the teen crowd."
2,Puleese not Mayer,"Teddy G seems to have talent, but what is unfortunate is the NOISE in this CD. Instead of a vocally driven CD, we have instrumentation galore - and unfortunately that comes from the music company, not the artist. Hopefully, next time they will let fans listen to the VOICE without wincing at the blaring background music.And that is the difference between Teddy and Gavin DeGraw. Gavin's CD is pure masterpiece - we hear his voice, we hear the rasp. Geiger, to me, has much more talent and must less nasal annoyance (and less attitude) than Mayer. If he was another Mayer, I wouldn't have bothered to buy this CD at all.TG is young and will do well. Hopefully the next CD will showcase his real talent."
3,THE ALBUM,"I love ""Air Dry"" great song.....all of them are great songs....but this guy sounds like ""john mayer""....but he has his own uniqueness (??) and I love the show Love Monkey which introduced him, but yet CBS dropped it...but VH1 picked it up - so PEOPLE, PLEASE WATCH....it's ""sex in the city"" for guys...."
2,Unimpressed,"Teddy Geiger's age shows through, both in the quality of his voice and the songs that are presented here. It's like someone shoved Jason Mraz and John Mayer into a food processor, and this is what came out. I am just...disappointed.I wouldn't recommend spending money on this. Download, if you must, but don't pay."
5,Teddy's CD is great,"It a refreshing CD of music. Really good songs. And he's a true artist. He's not a decoy, like so many other pop artists out there right now. The strongest song is the first one - These Walls. It's so catchy, you'll be singing it all over the place. Definately worth buying!"
5,Amazing,"This guy makes me want to cry. His songs and music are extremly well written and most importantly, he's for real. He's not manufactured like a lot of the artists these days and when i found out he was seventeen, well it totally blew my mind. I NEVER buy cd's, but i am planning on buying this one. I recommend this cd for anyone who is looking for an escape from all the fake, lip syncing, manufactured artists that there are so many of these days, cause this guy is pure talent."
5,Jack Jack Jack,"Bruce Campbell is one of a kind!!! His Writing, and Directing, and Acting is fanominal! This series I recamend as a Bruce fan!"
4,Great Fun...,What a fun show. Not quite as good as The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. but worth the money I paid just for the laughs. The theme song is great and Bruce Campbell is awesome (as always).
4,Great Series - no special features though,"This is a great series, especially if you're a history geek. Granted it's not historically accurate, but you'll catch some references that others don't.I only saw a couple episodes of the series when it was originally on, because of the station it was on's horrendous scheduling, and wasn't impressed. But I bought the series anyway to give it an honest viewing, and because I'm a Bruce Campbell geek. Classic Bruce Campbell style....Wish there were some special features or commentaries though..."
2,"Worth watching, not worth buying","The show is actually quite funny and made me laugh quite a bit, however, by the last episode, the jokes become stale and predictable. Overall, I think it was fun to watch once, but it will be a long time before I watch rewatch an episode."
2,Jack of All Trades - The Complete Series,"As much as We like Bruce Campbell, we are sorely dissappointed in this series. The focus on modern politics etc is unnecesary and distracting. We were looking for a post-revolutionary enjoyable romp, but that's not what we got. Bruce is good no matter what you put him in, he's even funny doing a commercial for body wash, and the potential was there for him to be really amusing. But the script and other ""UNKNOWN"" actors just kept dragging the whole thing down. Such a dissappointment. I would like to get my money back on this one."
2,Huge Bruce fan ... however..,"I love Bruce, and if your a Bruce fan then you understand. This series is as you expect a Bruce series to be, funny, goofy and fun. However, as this series develops, is takes on what I can only describe as a juvenile and childish sense of sexual innuendo. The innuendo keeps getting worse and more juvenile as it progresses. It's like watching a 13 year old making sexual jokes around his buddies. It becomes about what words can I twist to insert a ""clever"" sex joke. I can see why this one got canceled so quickly. Really disappointed."
1,"An intriguing idea, gone horribly wrong","This series is embarassingly badly written. The humor, if you can call it that, is on the level of a 4th grade boys' locker room. The ""history"" is beyond questionable... clearly no effort was made for any sense of accuracy. Even as a 'spoof' it falls flat. The surprise isn't that it only aired for one sesaon but that it aired at all."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I enjoyed ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. It seemed, and based on other customer reviews, to follow that this would be equally enjoyable. Each episode is a mere twenty one minutes in length. Little or no story made for a real snooze fest. I'd like my money back."
1,"Silly, Childish and Silly",I purchased this item because I had enjoyed Bruce Campbell in Briscoe County Junior. This is no Briscoe County Junior. There is nothing funny about this comedy and one can easily see why it did not last or make it into the mainstream. The cast continually try to over do the lines with the result that even good lines become unfunny because of the delivery
2,Surprised,"I was surprised to discover this series had been released on DVD. I watched it when it first came on TV, being a Bruce Campbell fan, but was very disappointed. While the 2 stars were good & had great chemistry as a team, the stories were just too silly and I wasn't surprised that it didn't last long. It's hard to believe that this show has been released on DVD and not Special Unit 2, a smart funny clever show that actually lasted 2 seasons. I've been waiting for SU2 to be released."
3,Disappointing.,"I was disappointed in this series. It has great costumes and characters, but there is absolutely no cohesive story line or plot. Just a bunch of characters running about making suggestive remarks to each other. I didn't even watch the whole first dvd and sold the series to someone else."
1,Not for Children,"I would rate this as a PG13 to R -for TV viewing, based on the heavy inferences in the dialog. I purchased this after viewing the Brisco County Jr. series that Bruce Campbell was in. I looked forward to his action filled - Family rated - style from Brisco. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The inferences are about what you'd hear on teen-age ""B"" movies."
1,Childish but full of sexual innuendos,ImmatureThis could have been better.It was silly enough for my kids to watch but there are blatant sexual innuendos through out each episode. They could have kept the innuendo and targeted an older audience but the childish story line and unbelievable plot was too corny for an adult comedy.This was a disappointing buy.Anyone interested in buying my copy I'll sell real cheap!
4,Um...Bruce Campbell...,"I knew this was a Bruce Campbell series and didn't know what to expect after seeing movies like ""The Man with the Screaming Brain"" among others. He's not the best actor, and this series makes fun of that. It is filled with historical inacuracies, poor plot, and little character development. It's best features are special effects and costumes/props. But...it is still Bruce Campbell, and therefore...funny."
3,More about design than actual code,"The book is much more about how to design a service than about TCP/IP. If you want detailed explanations about sockets, you will not find them here. But if you want different scenarios to design a service, this is the book for you. The code snippetes are trivial and poorly explained."
2,Total Letdown and unispired,"Okay, I have no idea why I am seeing so many awesome reviews on this CD. I got ""Towers of Advince"" after reading the reviews, and it was justified. That CD was very original sounding and flowed nicely. It was technical, but didn't lull you into boredom like Spiral Architect or something.However, ""Fragile Mind"" COMPLETELY stinks. Every song sounds like the previous one, and they all sound like copycats of ""Towers of Advince."" Seriously, some riffs are straight out of their last albumn. You know how some bands just make a new CD that sounds like their successful one? Well this is like that.I'm not saying this band sucks - because the last CD was one of the best progressive CD's I've ever heard. But this one put me to sleep. I've tried getting into it, but it's just the same sound over and over."
1,breaks easily,"this product would probably be fine if you connected it and left it alone. I disconnected mine a couple of times, and the prongs break off very easily if you're not right on the target when reconnecting. I'm looking for a new cable."
2,Didn't Last,I bought this and it was awesome for about a month and then the switch started messing up I had to have the switch turned just right like between monitor selections in order to get the video signal through. I would steer clear of this switch and spend a little more on a better one.
4,works as it should,"small basic manual vga switchconnected two pc's to it and plugged output into tvpush left or right button and swiches vga inputit's pretty small and does what I needed it to do: save me the trouble of having to disconnect/reconnect a TV to two different PC's, and didn't want to use my power-hungry (thus retired) KVM switch. This switch uses no power"
3,Works adequately.,"If you need to split your VGA output, well it splits it. I haven't tried it on a run longer than 6 feet, so I don't know if you need to amplify the signal. Knob on front is a little tough to turn and the inputs on the back seem loose in the case. Otherwise it works as described."
1,"GREEN, not white.","The description does not state a color, but the picture is quite clear - this item is intended to be white (or maybe off-white). What I received could only be described as ""olive green"". If this were going to be installed inside a Humvee, it would be perfect. On an office desk? Not so much."
3,Epidemiology on Valium,"This book reviews the Hantavirus outbreak in the Four Corners region. It is written from the standpoint of a (cautious) epidemiologist. Other strains of Hantavirus are discussed. The history, vectors and environmental influences are examined. A comprehensive review of Hantavirus...But dull. The authors writing style drags. They repeat themselves frequently, make little jokes that are too dry to carry their own weight, and use an annoying 'literary' technique of stating a premise and then adding ""but that is not the way it happened"". After 100 pages this wears on the reader.Too bad! The material is unusually balanced, dispassionate and clear. A good introduction for a student considering a career in epidemiology - but hardly an enthralling night's read.For _that_ I would recommend ""Virus Hunter: Thirty Years of Battling Hot Viruses Around the World"" by C. J. Peters or ""The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance"" by Laurie Garrett."
1,Not worth your money,"I have bought this product on two different occasions and while I did lose some weight (about 10 lbs the first time, 5 lbs the second time) it made me horribly sick both times. Constant bouts of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."
1,use to be great,"I used to take this product, it was great when it had ephedra, but now that it doesn't it doen't it is just not the same. Too bad i really use to love it"
3,it's ok,Ripped fuel is alright if your on a budget but i would recommend Oxy Elite Pro if your serious about losing weight
2,Cheaply made costume,This costume is very poor quality and very itchy on my daughter. The crown is bascially foam that is squashed and will never stand up the way it's meant to... also way to large for a child. Very disappointed in this costume.
2,Flimsy costume with a no return policy,"I purchased this as a costume for my daughter. I found this costume to be flimsy and not worth the $27 charged. In addition, the company had a no return policy (which was not well publicized during the purchase transaction) so I am stuck with a junky costume. I do not recommend this product"
3,ok costume,"just an ok costume, nothing special,you could probably find it at target or walmart after halloween for half the price."
5,My daughter loves this!,"My 4 year old wanted to be Glinda for Halloween, she loves this costume. I let her wear it as much as she wants now that Halloween is over, it fits perfectly. It's kind of hard to get on & off, the sleeves are very snug. But, that's my only complaint so it's not so bad."
3,"Cute, but I wish the quality was better","Got this for my 4-year-old daughter for Halloween. She loved it, but complained that the sleeves were a little itchy. For as much as it cost (about $30), I was hoping for something a little more sturdy-- if my daughter would have tripped or something, the costume probably would have ripped in two. But it was cute, and my daughter loved the crown."
5,Essential reading,"I attribute much of what I do in practice to this book. The text is very readable and the information is presented clearly. If I were allowed only one book on acupuncture, this would be the one."
5,Bridge of Light,One of the most beautiful pieces of music composed by Keith Jarrett and very different from his Solo piano and trio works. An essential addition to anyones Jarrett collection.
5,Very un-Jarrett-like,"The five-movement piano and violin sonata is worth the price of the disk. Jarrett fans will not recognize his hand in this. It lies somewhere in a triangle between Ravel, Shostakovich and Alban Berg. Each movement is compelling in its own way; the fourth movement reaches a tense, transfixing climax. I also like the first piece on the disk, for violin soloist and string orchestra. I have not been able to appreciate the piece for oboe and strings or the piece for viola and full orchestra; maybe that's my fault. It doesn't matter, because the piano/violin sonata is a revelation."
3,Bridge to Nowhere,"I am a long-time Jarrett fan, enjoying both his jazz and classical albums. His The Melody, At Night, With You is one of the most gorgeous recordings ever made. But this is contemporary classical music of a most forgettable and unmelodic sort. It will satisfy some conservatory types, no doubt, but I fear that most listeners will be bored if not irritated. Alas."
4,Holding Water!,"For an element so basic, water's looming on the horizon as the big issue of our times. Strangely, it hasn't been addressed much or weighed much on the public consciousness. I've been a fan of Wyland for a long time, so I have to applaud the artist's growing concern for raising awareness about the future of this precious resource. Hold Your Water covers a large amount of information territory in one of the most accessible, and dare I say, funny, ways I've seen in a book of this type. the graphics were clever, and some of the sources suprised me (George Bush, Sr?), but it appears that addressing environmental issues is going to require big efforts on both sides of the aisle. It still seems weird to hear from the Bushes and Mahatma Ghandi side by side. But the point is well taken. The water issue isn't going away. The question now is: will we prepared to handle it before it becomes too large to address."
4,True Love IS Powerful! --'Two Hats' Bears Witness to This Fact.,A very poignant piece for loving God and His People everywhere and right now (No Excuses) ...Perfect to view with the entire family!
4,Knorr Classic Brown Gravy,"I usually buy this in the grocery store and the price was much better online. Unlike the American products, each package yields 2 c. of gravy. Better bang and flavor for your buck."
3,"A must have if you are a Bond fan, if not, don't bother.","Bond clips from DRNO to AVTAK with a few photo's of TLD to GE.As I said, a must have for Bond fans."
1,Perhaps it's a bad copy,"There are some great songs on this two-disc CD set. However, the copy I received was poor. The sound was distinctly distorted, and I'm no audiophile. I noticed the distortion on the first song of disc 1, and the distortion was evident on both my computer (Windows Media Player) and on my CD player. This was a new CD set from one of the subcontractors for Amazon, not from Amazon itself. I don't know if that made a difference."
4,Door Handle replacement spring,Works as expected and received in mail very quickly. I was quite impressed with how quickly and easily it was to locate and buy this product.
2,Small Gas Engine Repair,"This book is very in-depth. From beginning to end it describes types of engines, troubleshooting,and individual engine components or systems. The book is certainly not a book for someone that does not already have a working knowledge of engines. The tech information and drawings are very confusing. There is little doubt that Mr. Dempsey knows all about engine repair. It is not a book for the average person that wants to learn to repair a lawn mower. If the author's intention was to provide a teaching text--in my opinion, he missed the mark."
1,don't bother,"If you like just reading about small engines generally, this is your book. If you actually want to fix a specific engine that you have, you should look for more specific information elsewhere."
5,My Shop's handiest Manual -- can't get by without it!,"The best, most universal content -- this book is mandatory for anyone working on those smaller engines -- Fantastic Deal ---- You should buy one of these -- it's neat !! XLNT Tranzaxion! Would buy again! Rating AAAAA+++++"
4,Prayer.,This is a valuable book for people wanting to move further in prayer and spiritual growth.It is well written and easy to use.The exercises could be of great use in finding oneself in the process of spiritual maturation.Definitely some suggestions here for the use of spiritual directors.
1,Rip-off,"I was so glad to find this on DVD that I failed to read the customer reviews before I bought it. Big mistake. Many of the finer scenes that I remember from the mini-series are missing. The quality of the DVD is excellent, and the sound is good, but about HALF THE FILM IS MISSING!! Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding in the lead role, but it's hard to tell from this mess. What an awful shame to cripple the film this way, just to fit it on a single DVD. Have they never heard of double-sided DVDs? Hopefully, with the interest generate by Scorcese's new movie, someone will do a proper release of this very interesting telling of the Hughes story."
1,A major disappointment from original release on T.V.,TNT showed this a few years back and I recorded it to VHS without the commercials and I find myself watching that fuzzy old self-recorded VHS more than this DVD! They added a couple of meaningless scenes and removed many major and important ones. Watching this DVD after seeing the TV version (same applies to the VHS version) makes me feel sick! Wait till it comes around on TV and skip this one folks.
1,Robert Balaban,I was extremley disappointed in the movie a far cry from the first showing on TNT. Really cut up and hard to understand is there any way of buying the uncut version??????????????????????
1,Zero Stars -- Bait-and-switch,"I bought this version and was ripped off. Out of the 215-minute movie, they deleted 40% of it. Critical parts of the story are missing. They did not sell the movie as an abridged version.In addition, the sound is so bad that it's very annoying to watch it. The sound has a great deal of phase shifting. If the original is in this shape, it needs to be restored before selling anymore copies."
1,SAD,"I too was all so excited to see this on dvd and bought it without reading any reviews.I did not think I needed to because I saw the movie twice on TV and thought it was excellent . I told my girlfriend all about it and we sat down to watch it and I kept saying all throughout the movie ""Hey,they left something out"" over and over again. I live in Shreveport Louisiana and I was real let down when they left that part out when he showed up here and wound up in jail.I bet ya'll would like to know more about that.Well I guess you will have to see the movie.BUT NOT THIS VERSION.THEY CUT OUT WAAAAY TOO MUCH!!!!"
2,Amazing Howard Hughes,"Despite what the Amazon description reads this is NOT the full version of the TV mini-series, The Amazing Howard Hughes. It's only 123 minutes long and it a severly ""edited"" version of this enjoyable program. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS PRODUCT! Wait until the full version is released, hopefully sometime within this millenium."
3,Short changed,"So much has been cut from the movie I lose track of the plot and start to lose interest,Im sorry for the cuts in the movie"
1,Terrible,"Well I thought I was going to be the only one who hated this movie, but now that I've read the other reviews, at least I know why it's so bad. I hadn't known it was going to be so cut up. It's so disjointed that it's impossible to follow. And, I hate to say it, but Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this is sub-par. Every role I've seen him in (up to this point) has been outstanding, so this was a major disappointment. The only good thing I can say is that I am VERY glad I was able to see this before purchasing it, so now I don't have to waste my money. Watch ""The Aviator"" instead.. it tells a lot of the same story, but it's done so much better, and the acting in that movie is incredible. This movie is barely even a story. Disappointing!!!!"
2,Amazing Howard Hughes,The original uncut film is excellent.The re-released cut version leaves a 50% out. I agree with the other disappointed reviewers.
2,this move now sucks,they cut parts out of this movie it's not worth the money i paid for it .now it really sucks!!!!!
2,"Dated, dry movie about one the most mysterious men ever.","This movie is the most boring biographical movie I have ever seen. Its educational value is lost due to its boring nature. Its entertaining value is virtually non-existant. Toomy Lee Jones, playing Hughes is the only bright spot. Considering that it was made for TV in 1970s, it is understandable that film lacks truth, for example, in regard to Hughes sexuality. So, if you need some serious info on Hughes, you'd better read a book and if you looking for plain cinematic entertainment, you willl not find it here."
1,Don't be fooled by the (1994)!,"The Amazing Howard Hughes is a shockingly substandardmade-for-television production originally shown in 1977. People""will little note nor long remember"" Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this stink bomb that one of the television networks whipped together to attract viewers interested in Hughes' then-recent death. If you're keen on checking out a cool portrayal of H.R.H. Jr., see Dean Stockwell in Coppola's, Tucker: A Man and his Dream, or even Howard Hughes himself in Welles' F For Fake. That's the straight dope. END"
2,Not really standardized Valerian,"This Nature's Way product like others says it's standardized but when you get it, and look at its ingredients, only 220mg of it is standardized and the other 800mg of Valerien Root isn't. This is a very deceitful practice and I'm finding that this is a common problem with so called standardized anything."
3,"Helps with anxiety during the day, but did NOT help me sleep....","I have PCOS, and deal with extreme changes in mood at the end of my cycle. I originally bought this as a sleep aid, but when it didn't work there, I tried it during the day for my moodswings. I wasn't going to attempt this at all because this actually jerked me awake at night. It made me drowsy at first, but gave me shoots of energy every time I started drifting off.Somehow, it helps me during the day, though. It isn't like an anti-depressant; it just calms me and does make me a little drowsy. I figured I was one of those in the minority that gets excitable from valerian and hesitated to use it during the day. But, the energy shoots only didn't occur with daytime use. So, it doesn't work for what I intended, but it is of some use. I can't vouch for the quality of this product becasue it's the first valerian pill I've tried."
1,Ugh the smell,"Not sure this stuff really does anything to help sleep or relaxation, but it does smell like feet for whatever that's worth."
2,Different and sub-standard product delivered by Nature's Way,The bottle I received had a green top- not as pictured on Amazon. The bottle I received was marked 100 capsules while the bottle put on Amazon by Nature's Way said 90 capsules. The capsules I received had less total in each than Nature's Way on Amazon The capsules I received from Nature's Way gave me headaches and kept me awake for two hours.- only one taken each evening. I was hoping to get a cheaper way to desensitize some leg muscles at night like Valerin from Wonder Laboratories- Valerian does none of that.
1,these stunk,"i heard these were good for you by dr oz so i bought them, but couldnt stomach them especially the smell"
1,did nothing for me,Had hoped for this to help me sleep. For me it did nothing. In the morning I had a headache.
2,It's an overview for someone with mild interest,"I agree with ""Mystic's"" review. If you are looking for just some generalized information about surfcasting, this is a nice little intro. It's handy to have on your bookshelf; but it is by no means a ""Compleat"" look at the subject. Novices will come away with too much generalization to make good decisions, and experienced surfcasters won't find the detail they need to confront specific issues about tackle, fish species or techniques. Like too many ""how to"" publications, it's written with an orientation toward East Coast lore, techniques, attitudes, and species of fish. If you fish the Pacific Coast, this book will add nothing to your knowledge, and will in fact mislead you. Yes, the information is dated, but since surfcasting books are VERY rare, this one gets points for just attempting to cover the subject. It's a book to have, but treat it as an introductory primer only."
1,DVD's for movement,I thought this product could be used for the elementary school where I work. There was too much talking. The students were not kept busy enough. It was very disappointing.
1,Hip Hop Homeromme,"Awful!Julianna appears for about 5 Minutes in this Video. And I think kids don't learn that much by watching this. (There's a 5 minute track about 1 + 1 = 2 .... come on!)The music is boring und monotonous and the dances are idealess. (Just Juliannas dances are ok, but as I mentioned she appears for just a couple of minutes.)If your kids like monotonous techno music with bored spoken song-texts that are called ""Hip Hop"" and really still have to learn to add and subract single numbers ... have a try.(I know that it is spelled ""subtract"" ... but the inside of the box says, that the video will learn the kids to ""subract"" ... so I took it over so far. By the way ... if there is an orthography-video available by this publisher ... don't by it!)If you want your kids to have fun with math, let them watch Sesame Street, they will learn more by watching this. Only if your kids are really fan of Julianna, you might have a try."
5,great for kids just learning to add and if they like dancing,"I took a chance and bought this dvd for my granddaughter who is just starting to learn to add. She is in kindergarten. She loved it. But may I add... I think part of positive reaction is she loves to see kids dance, as she learns new moves from them. It was like a dance video with some math snuck in it!"
2,"Daddy and Daughter say ""Two thumbs Down""","My little girl is a big fan of Lazytown and of Julianna Rose Mauriello so I thought this would be a good DVD for her. Especially since she's just learning basic math.I was wrong.My daughter was quick to point out the poor production value. ""Daddy, why does it sound like that?"" ""Daddy, why are there lines buzzing through the kids?"" ""Daddy...why did it suddenly get loud?""AWFUL sound quiality, Video that is riddled with noise and a post-production inserts of Julianna Rose Mauriello throughout the video to make it look like she was part of the production.I can't help but feel that Mauriello was probably sorry she got involved with this one.The math songs talk a lot about how fun math is but in most cases only share one or two siple 1+1 problems.My daughter is the judge here: ""Daddy... this is pretty bad. Why are they doing that song again?""Daddy and Daughter say ""Two thumbs Down."""
3,A mixed bag,"Christoph von Dohnanyi is a great conductor, but his set of Schumann symphonies is not an unqualified success. The best thing here (and one hopes it will be reissued in a bargain series in the future) is a deeply felt, noble peformance of the Symphony No. 2. The First and Fourth symphonies are both good, yet they both seem a bit to dogged and relentless to really take flight. Dohnanyi's approach to the Third keeps the middle movements flowing along to avoid the blandness of routine that creeps into so many performances, but in doing so, he also misses most of the varied and endearing emotions of these movements. Recorded sound is good, but I must say this: Having heard this conductor and orchestra in concert several times, I think it's a real shame that no recording company ever caught their glorious sound quite right."
2,The Alienist It Aint!,"Any attempt to liken this book to the masterpieces of Caleb Carr are totatally misleading. The only commonality I could ascertain was the similarity in time period, otherwise it was totally eclipsed by the rich texture, obvious detailed background research and sheer literary talent of Carr. The now obvious marketing ploy of linkage to Carr falls little short of false and misleading advertising.The only real comparison to Carr that I can truly recommend is Margaret Atwood's fascinating ""Alias Grace"" which also delves into early insights in the field of forensic psychiatry while at the same time maintaining the excitement of an ""un-put-downable"" thriller."
4,interesting first overview,"I was looking for a first smell/flavour of life in Australia and this book offered me a good primary insight, along with two three tips;Loads of comparison with Britain/life in UK..."
1,Seller did not send the item - only a small portion of it.,"I ordered the set and only 1 of the 10 readers arrived, obviously well-used and worn. I expected the rest of the set to arrive and weeks have passed and still nothing. This was to have been a Christmas gift for a grandchild and now it is too late."
3,Missing Book,This arrived missing one book - the Max book. I am not sure how to get only one of the books replaced but was disappointed that it was not a complete set! The rest of the books are amazing.
4,IT WORKS!,"I first purchased the first series with ""Max the Cat"", in 1982, when the school system decided to utilize a new approach to reading WITHOUT using phonics, a sight word memorizing technique. That's when I decided to teach my son how to read. I purchased all four series, and susequently taught all four of my sons how to read prior to entering kindergarten. Knowing how to sound words out, helped them become better spellers as well as readers. I am presently purchasing these series again for my grandchildren. You can't go wrong, once children know their alphabet by recognition they can easily read with this phonetic series. The questions at the end of each booklet, helps them with comprehension also."
4,Excellant reading for the new reader.,My daughter is just learning to read and these books give her the confidence and motivation to continue reading. The books are large type with plenty of sight word recogition. I would recommend these books to all kids learning to read.
5,Gus,"My favorite is Gus. I just love Gus. And, that huge great revelation at the end when he has no fuzz! It's great..."
2,"Weak, and short lived",My wife has used these for a few weeks and I can scarcely tell when she has sprayed it on. The scent is quite pleasant but seems to disappear within a very short time.
3,It works but not as shown.,The one you sent works but it doesn't look a thing like the picture. You should sell what you advertise.
5,Wow!,"I just heard a few songs of this album and all I can say is: WOW! How did these classics not make the cut? Oh well, at least I can look forward the Lost Tapes 2, comin out soon.Best Track: Doo Rags"
5,This is Hip hop pt.1,This is a classic the beats are raw he put this came out a day after my friends birthday I like this everbody sould buy this.
3,Good but overrated by reviewers here (3.5 stars),"This is a dope collection of unreleased Nas tracks but people who are sayin it's his best album & better than Illmatic are crazy. Some of these tracks aren't that hype & have that ""new Nas"" sound to them, but still a solid release worth having. Better than Nastradamus, most of I Am besides a few tracks like the Primo produced ones, God's Son, Street's Disciples & possibly It Was Written. Stillmatic is slightly better, that's like a 4 star album to me, & Illmatic is of course, not to be arrogant but as any true head knows.Anyway cop it, it's hot none the less."
4,where'd you lose 'em,"Nas delivers some prerecorded material (half of which I have heard years ago). It's got no weak spots, all good songs but no great 1 or 2 to get it 5 stars (I would've liked to see ""Silent Murder"" on this one). Features no one except Nas (AZ talks in the background on one song). Production is handled by some bigger names and is good. L.E.S. and Hill Inc. each do 3 songs, Alchemist does 2, and Precision, Al West, Rockwilder, and D-Dot all do 1. A good cd to have for his fans.#1 - 8.5#2 - 8.5#3 - 8#4 - 8#5 - 9#6 - 8#7 - 8.5#8 - 9#9 - 8.5#10 - 9#11 - 8.5#12 - 8.5b. Nasir Jones (9/14/73)b.

3,good cd,it's good but it's not that great. 3 stars at the most. I don't see how people gave it 5 stars. People think that just because an album is good it deserves 5 stars. 5 stars means flawless and the lost tapes is not flawless.
5,I bet the person who lost these tracks was fired!!!,"Its a good thing that these ""lost tracks"" were recovered because if not we would be out of some classic Nas material. I have always been a fan of Nas's music and I was really glad when this was released. Every song on this album is good. I can't wait for his next release, but first I need to go back to the store and buy this album again because I let someone borrow it and now it skips. I cant have that!!!! So Nas....your about to get a 2 for 1. Cause Im gonna have to buy this one again. But I dont mind because this album is that good.this is a must have for any hip hop fan and especially for Nas fans."
5,Should Be Renamed Best Tapes,"How can a collection of songs be this good. I personally think it's ironic that these songs (some made in 1997) are better than 98% of the hip-hop albums out there. At first, I was skeptical about getting the album. But after hearing Stillmatic, I was eager to hear anything I could from Nas. D*mn, this album was just like advertised; no videos, no gimmicks, no bullsh*t."
4,Nas's Best Release Since Illmatic,"This isn't even an official album, yet its one of the best hip hop/rap albums of all time. A Must Buy."
5,Another Classic 5 Stars,"Just when u heard ""Stillmatic"", Nas brings us another banger. ""The Lost Tapes"" is an album with unreleased classics. You can hear that Nas has never lost his magic touch. The beats are real hardcore and don't be afraid there are no Braveheart member on this one. It's just another classic."
2,Waste of time and money,"There is a reason why I thought this might be a waste of money and its quite clear after hearing this CD a few times why my first instincts were clear.There's a reason why these songs werent put on other albums. THEY'RE HORRIBLE. Jigga man said it best when he said ""spark when you started but now you just garbage"". NAS is the most over rated MC on the market today, if you don'tbelieve me pick up his whole collection, then write me an email. I get more out of reading emily dickinson for 50 mins then putting this garbage in my head. No good beats, no good hooks, just a bunch of fast talk about stories that probably arent even true. The people who gave this album a good rating are quite obviously unstable.If you want some REAL east coast rapJAY-Z Resonable DoubtJAY-Z Blueprint (and Blueprint 2)Biggie- Ready to DieShyneMase- Harlem World"
1,1 mic,"Nas should've retired after Illmatic. Sure, this is better than Stillmatic, but that's like bragging about winning the special olympics."
1,Yawner,"This CD is not very good. No song really sticks out and the beats are pretty monotonous. Buy Illmatic and I am..and avoid this stinker. Also, pick up all of Jigga's CDs cos theyre a lot hotter than this!!"
5,return to roots,"this is Nas's closest attempt at recreating the magic of illmatic. The lyrics are all as serious and issue conscious as ever, plus without the top 40 beats, makes this only an album for serious rap fans... Any teeni-bopper can enjoy 'THe Blueprint', or even do a degree 'Stillmatic', but the lost tapes is a return to glory, that I personally believe Nas never left.Another perfect album."
3,cracked cd case,"The CD is great, but the CD case was cracked. this made me concerned but everything was ok."
3,It's Ok......,"Drunk By Myself, No idea's Original and Poppa was a Playa are good tracks. Blaze A 50 is the best song and the rest is ok, except for black zombie....that song stinks......."
5,Profoundly Rewarding,"Having been disappointed in the past by a CD of some symphonies by the Georgian composer Giya Kancheli (b. 1935), I was not expecting much from Abii ne Viderem (""I turned away so as not to see""), I nearly turned away from this CD as so not to hear any more of his music, but lo and behold, what I heard was profoundly rewarding, and when I get time, I plan to reaudition some of his other works and see whether I judged too hastily a few years back. Kancheli is from Georgia, an ancient region that was for many years a captive of the Soviet Union, and his music is a blending of ancient and modern, something like Aarvo Pärt, but different, at once serene yet quietly disturbing. ECM has thoughtfully included a booklet with notes on the composer and the music, and has recorded this quiet music in a beautiful and appropriate acoustic."
5,Great boots:,"Work outside as a carpenter. Boots give me bout 2 years service,comfortable. Purchase from Amazon save about $60.00 . Way to shop."
5,nailer,"Ninety percent of nail gones are not equipped with a case, which this one comes standard with along with safety glasses and oil. The magazine hold 2 strips or 72 nails. Its operating pressure ranges from 70 to 120 psi. The tool weighs in at 7.5 lbs which is actually farelly light for a framing nailer. This tool fires like a dream it is extremely low maitenance and exceptionally dependable. Ive replaced my o rings 1 time in three years of steady usage, and that is almost unheard of."
3,Reliable but....,"I have owned my FR350 for almost two years. It has been a reliable nailer but has a tendency to double strike (drives two nails). This is a function of trigger hold time and can be mastered but not easily. The gun works great ""on the fly"" (holding down the trigger and hitting the board with the armed gun) but some frown on this technique."
5,Everything I needed,"A year ago I rented a framer for deck alterations. A neighbor brought his Porter Cable over to help. His FR350A was better balanced, looked better built and seemed more responsive. So last week when HomeDepot advertised them at $119.00 I bought one for myself and one as a Christmas gift for my son."
5,Super Nailer,"I bought the FR350 and also Porter-Cables roofing and 15ga. finish nailers. All three work perfectly, and are priced much less than others. They all came with a case and all wrenches needed for adjustments, and a pre installed Milton quick coupler fitting. I'm very satisfied with all three nailers."
5,A Must Have!,"I just finished building a 2 floor barn and purchased 2 of these nailers. Could not have worked at a quarter of the speed without them. Very few problems in over 10,000 nails. I purchased 2 so when a friend was helping on the day I roofed and sheathed we both had one! Also it saved from changing nail sizes. I'm about to move onto a 1200 sq ft garage project at Easter and know that these nailers will make quick work of the rough work."
1,Made in Taiwan?,"I purchased one of these tools for use by a couple of the new guys on the crew. I figured I would save a few bucks and the new guys wouldn't notice. Since the day we have had it though, we have had nothing but problems. O-rings, bumpers, drive pins! I talked to the guy at the service shop and he said that Porter Cable was just buying these from some company in Taiwan and slapping their name on it. I am disappointed since I have long been a fan of Porter Cable power tools and they advertise that they make their stuff in the USA. Trust me, if you are a heavy duty user go with the Hitachi or a Bostitch. They won't let you down...or empty your wallet!"
4,Home user,"I bought this for work around the house, but was worried my compressor may be to light (2.5 @ 90). I have used to for a few jobs now and it works fine.It drives the nails and makes the job of toeing so easy. I regret not buying it sooner. A couple of things, it's easy to use and hey it's a porter cable. Nail sizes like 2"" are not easy to find but the 2 3/8, 3 /1/2 are. Make sure you order the free safety trigger so you don't double nail things. Amazon list the 800 number. Great gun for any 2x4 work your doing."
2,worked great at first,I bought three of these guns because the first one was excellent at first. I framed a few houses with the first one and bought two more. then the firing pin bent on the first on after only a few months of work. I've always used Bostich nailers with years of service before any problems. I feel this gun is not reliable for production use. Now I buy Hitachi round head framers.
5,FR350 Nailer,"Excellent nailer. Powerful, rugged,lightweight. It's a joy putting a nail in an area that would have been very difficult with a hammer."
3,Jammed every 5 nails,"I recently bought this nailer to build my deck. After 3 hours of struggle ... I gave up. I finished up the work hand nailing. Later a friend who also happen to have the same nailer, claimed that this nailer is the best in the market, came over to check it out. But it is what it is: a lemon ... 'may be'.Next day I returned the nailer."
3,A little off the mark,"I think Porter-Cable has designed a nice lightweight workhorse in this nail gun, but it doesn't come close to the performance of other PC tools. My main problem is that the round heads tend to catch on the nail gun magazine between clips causing it to misfire and/or jam. The nails I used were correct, so I know this isn't the problem. This problem has occured numerous times over the course of 5,000 nails. This could have caused severe problems on my Trex Deck, but luckily I was able to get a feel for when this would occur and constantly had to check the magazine before firing. It also is not consistant in countersinking the nails. I had to go back over several of the nails in my deck and pound them down. Maybe I just got a bad gun. Please read the other reviews and make your decision based on everyone's opinion and not just mine."
4,Good value,Since this is the only framing nailer I've ever owned I have no comparisons but the gun has performed very well over the 7 months I've owned it. I get occasional double bounces but I love the face that the rubber foot comes off which gives you a ridged foot for toenailing. The only jams I notice are when I add a stick when there is only a nail or two left in the slide. So I've gotten in the habit of shooting out until the gun is empty.
1,Nosepiece problems,"I have had the gun for less than 2 years and had the Nosepiece replaced twice. The third Nosepiece has broken and I think I will just go back to my Stanley-Bostitch. The flush nailer, feel and weight is great!"
2,Should I buy one more...?,"Up until last week I would have given the FR350 a stellar 5-star rating but now I'm wondering if 2 stars is over-rated.I'll try to sum up the sad story as quickly as possible:I fired the first nail back in August of 2001. Last week (Feb 2002) its last nail was fired (probably approaching nail # 20,000.) After taking it into the repair shop, they unload the bad news... busted firing pin (or whatever it's called). Unfortunately it's no longer covered under warranty since I purchased it back in December of 2000 (even though it sat on the shelf for another eight months unopened).So here's the dilemma, do I buy another PC or do I go with another brand and possibly pay twice as much??Like I say, up until last week, I thought the FR350 was top-notch."
1,Find another Nailer!,"Don't waste your time with this nailer. I am a huge Porter Cable Fan and have many if their quality tools, however, this one does not due the name justice. I didn't get ten nails out before the thing jammed. After taking it apart to get the nail out, it jammed again. I immediately returned it to the Depot and bought a Hitachi."
5,Brio is Best!,"I purchased this at Tuesday Morning for one dollar and 99 cents. It was well worth it! My son loves it! The little car is wooden with a little plastic on the wheels. By son is a train lover so for 1.99 we indulge him.Brio is a durable brand but does have more plastic pieces that the Thomas and Friends brand that is mainly wooden. That is the only fall back for me. It pulls perfectly behind Thomas, Percy and Gordon. It is the same scale at the Thomas so they work beautifully together!"
3,Does NOT fit Mazda CX7,"I'm giving this a 3star because I don't actually know how well it performs, so I don't know if it is terrible or not. I just know that this is the incorrect filter for a Mazda CX7.The part finder lists this as the replacement filter for the Mazda CX7. This is not correct. It is too short, too wide, and too tall. According to the Wix website, the proper part number isWix 42885 Air Filter Panel for select Fiat models, Pack of 1.according to the Wix website [...]Mazda CX7 Filter (42885):Length: 12.204""Width: 6.909""Height: 1.929""Wix 42793 Filter:Length: 10.000Width: 7.000Height: 2.350Here's the Wix Filter Look up on their website[...]"
2,not worth the money,I bought this almost 2 years ago and have already had to replace one of the metal sides as a hole rusted right through it with in one year. I do not think this product is worth the amount that is charged. I would look for something made all of compost plastic as metal is a poor choice. There are other products that charge a lot less that I would consider also.
3,expensive handle,"I bought this particular model of composter because of a previous review that called it the ""cadillac"" of composters. It is nice and big and I have not used it for long but the handle seems to be the best part of the design. I do not particularly like the way that the door comes off and on because I have to hook one side, bend the metal door around the curve and then double latch. There is a slightly annoying tendency to unhook before it gets latched.I just bought another composter that has a similar design but is made of plastic and without a handle to crank it around. Plastic seems like it will be more durable because it is less likely to rust.Overall, a nice product but perhaps not worth the extra cost over competing models."
4,Compact ComposTumbler: A good idea needs some help,"The Compact ComposTumbler is generally a good design for use on a deck, especially with the heavy duty crack to rotate the drum. Unfortunately, the door design is lacking. In order to open the door, it must be removed completely, then replaced. Replacing the door is not an easy task, because latches must be placed directly into catches while simultaneously re-curving the door to the round shape of the unit. My wife refuses to do it, because it is too difficult for her, and she does not feel as though she should have to spend so much time just closing a door.Attention to a little detail would drastically improve usability of this unit."
2,Was this a bootleg recording or what?!?!?!?,"The music here is pretty amazing!!!... but, it sounds like somebody with a cheap cassette recorder stuck it on the ground next to the drums and pressed the record button. The low frequency of the bass and the lower drums kept cancelling each other out. Otherwise, this would have gotten 5 stars from me."
4,Perfection By Design,"Randy's book sits prominently in my family room along side other Porsche books and is one of the few that is up to speed with some of the latest offerings from Zuffenhausen. Writing a book on the 911 is nearly impossible because there is so much out there. You have to know where to start and where to end,--and just how much to stuff in the middle. Randy pulls this off with a great selection of photos, most never before seen, and accurate detail of the nuances of the famous 911. The only negative I can find is what puts a book in the top 5% of books, and that is matching copy to photographs,--on the same page. This is extremely hard to do because it is generally unpredictable, where one paragraph or photograph will start or stop. That, along with a handfull of errors in photo IDs keeps it from perfection by design itself but it's nicely assembled and beautifully printed. Anyone with a 911 in their garage should have this book to help explain their addiction to normal people."
3,Interesting Concept for a Film,"I caught this film late at night on t.v. It is completely different than what the cover suggests. However, it is interesting to see how a ""one character"" film can be pulled off. It is an often sad film, but the lonely ""Link"" (as I refer to him) had some amusing moments. Watch for the scene in which he eats berries and they have a bombastic gastrointestinal result! Not a bad film, just different."
1,Not Much Point,"Well, what can I say about this movie? Kinda catchy cover on the case, but that's about it. There's really not much point to the movie. There is a ""man-ape"" who's family was just killed by humans making him the last of his kind. The movie may as well end there. Basically all that happens is we get to see him walk around the african countyside just taking in the scenery. Might as well be watching National Geographic than this movie. We get to see him watch elephants, birds, being scared of the big cats...and of course his daily eating of plants and going to the bathroom and sleeping, etc... WOW!!! Actually, they should have called it ""The Missing link's live cam"" Horrible movie."
1,Shallow,"The book is as shallow as the process. ""Let's pressure our 3 year old into taking yoga so that he gets into THE nursery school so that when we summer in the Hamptons, we won't be mortified when we tell our friends where he's going.....""The parents need a reality check, and the authors of this book need to chill out."
5,The most perfectly shaped wine glass,"I bought four of these at the local supermarket for $13 each, after searching for the perfect wine glass for weeks. These are exactly the right shape for a delicious red wine - big bulb, but not like a goldfish bowl; nicely tapered, and interesting Deco-ish shape for the stem. Dinner guests always comment on their beauty and how they make the wine seem expensive even if it's not. You just want to pour a glass, swirl it around, stick your nose deep in there, then take your first sip. You just feel elegant drinking with it. Anyway, Amazon's price of $10 per glass is a steal (with free shipping), so I got four more."
2,A Red Herring!?,"The confoundingly selective content of this book leads me to believe it was written as a disinformation tool to help shift the blame for 911 away from the Bush administration. On the other hand, if you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK with that famous single Magic Bullet (the case for which was made by Mr. Posner in his earlier work, 'Case Closed'), you'll LOVE this book. I give it two stars despite the content because the actual writing is engaging. I give it no more than two stars, however, because it is, in my view, essentially an unconvincing snow job."
1,I was surprised. Book is NOT really about Clinton.,"Not much in here about Clinton. Lots of stuff on the FBI and CIA, which I'm not as interested in. Agree with another reviewer who said the book is boring to read. Last chapter on the Saudi interrogation is good but only about 12 pages long."
2,Posner's book filled with incorrect information,"I have only read a little of Posner's book but have found the book full of inaccurate information and will lead me to question his research and information. For example, he says that 59 people were killed in the bombings in East Africa in 1998 (pg8) when the correct number is 224. He says the Lockerbie trial was held at the Hague (pg23) when in fact it was a Scottish court sitting in Kamp Zeist and had nothing to do, either geographically or politically with the Hague. I am very familiar with the Lockerbie bombing case and many of his ""facts"" about the investigation are distorted or wrong. The relationship between the CIA and FBI has been rocky, to say the least, through the years. For the sake of America I hope this is fixed but for an author who has written as much as Posner to have so many facts wrong in only 30 pages of a book, causes me to question all his facts and ultimately, his conclusions."
1,No Qualms,"Gerald Posner is an opportunist and a disingenous researcher. To say nothing of the fact that he obviously has no qualms about stealing the title of this book from a man whose legacy he did a diservice to in Case Closed. (JFK: Why England Slept). Tragic. If you are looking for something to start a fire with, I highly recommend you purchase this book."
5,Disclosure; after the fact,"The question is, why they can't them be more honest, themselves. We (public) aren't supposed to know everything, if we did, we wouldn't be able to sleep at night."
2,"Not that great, and GROSS overuse of footnotes","The story I found ho-hum, nothing really that amazing. I thought the official 9/11 report much more interesting.I was particularly distracted by Posner's overuse of footnotes -- not to be confused with endnotes, where an author documents his sources and are good, Posner likes to have footnotes sprinkled about on most pages. This style is annoying b/c apparently (or as near as I can figure), there is no threshold in Posner's mind as to what qualifies as a footnote versus a regular paragraph. A skilled author could easily have incorporated the relevant content of the footnotes into the main text.Overall, ho hum. Wish I didn't pay so much for the hard-cover version."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Talk about voice , voice and more gorgeous voice. There's seemingly nothing the Sutherland voice cannot do. Take about spectacular singing! This is UNREAL, if I didn't buy this set I never would have believe a human voice can sound like that. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Can I give 6 ou 7 stars??,"I've read all the reviews, and what can I say more?Sutherland seems not human. Her voice is so pure, so beautiful...Her technique is realy PERFECT. She was so young and fresh...This record does not deserve 5 stars. It deserves much, much more"
5,To the angry Callas fan...,"This is your review...Ok, I see that a fellow Callas fan has come here to do some bashing, but does that mean youSutherland fans need to be equally as childish and go to Callas recordings to bash herunnecessarily? I'll just say that my blood pressure rose sky high when I saw those mean reviews.I've never been so outraged in my entire life! And y'know what, I can play this stupid game too.From now on I'll make it a commitment to listen to a Sutherland recordingly each week, and ofcourse, assess that it's terrible. And as a result, you'll be hearing more from me, buster! This is justthe beginning!Aren't you just playing the childish game too?? And this basher of sutherland has done enough damage. And do you condemn him. Stop this. You've already put up a lot of one star review that you've never heard. Be the better person, stop this now! Beware of the Sills crowd. I actually think they planned this. Go to their site and check out their reviews."
5,Sutherland is the greatest diva in all the world,"And this is the recital of a lifetime. If you want to hear the greatest bel canto singing ever. Check this one out. obviously, we have a Callas or Sills basher here. Read the long reviews of Sutherland, ignore the children."
3,Useful to a Point,"Without an ounce of automotive experience, I took on the project of getting a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle that had not been touched in 25 years into good running condition. For some tasks, this book was very helpful; for others, however, it was so general and vague I was left scratching my head. Many walkthroughs were not detailed enough to include important information about things that might happen, or things to look out for. In short, it worked great for some repairs but should not be relied on as the only source of direction when working on old Volkswagens."
2,Not a good service manual; too generic. Better ones out there,"The book is very basic and clearly written from that perspective. Too general. Chilton and Haynes are very general. Not up to date either. 'How to Keep Your Volkswagon Alive ' by Tosh Greg is an outstanding book that is extremely detailed, up to date and covers everything you could imagine in any VW model, especially Beetles. But it covers them all, all years. That book is a better buy for the money and so detailed. I bought it after this one and regreted the first buy. The Chilton VW book here is not bad.....just not the best and not very well done when compared to others. I am not saying....I'm just saying. Keep rolling......Ed"
5,An excellent book for advanced users,"This book presents principles drawn from very large scale designs, like microprocessor. If you are looking for a book describing testbench implementation, another book, ""Writing testbenches functional verification of hdl models"", is more suitable. If you are working on very large scale and complex design verification, this book will be very helpful. The discussion of simulation optimization, X/Z state, X/Zero/Random initialization during simulation is very insightful."
5,Julian Samms rocks,"The Samms Agenda by Alison Kent is one hot scorcher.Julian Samms is a no nonsense, by the book operative for SG-5. His latest assignment is to get Katrina Flurry to safety and watch over her until another agent takes care of the threat on her life.Katrina Flurry a society columnist is coming off of a bad relationship. She didn't realize until it was too late, that what she was led to believe about Peter Deacon was all lies.Now there is a hit man out to silence Katrina. Julian and Katrina are on the run. Once they are at the safe house their attraction sets the night on fire. But danger is lurking.The Samms Agenda is a heart pounding, palm sweating, fan yourself read. This is a must read series."
4,nastalgic,"I saw this film years ago, The story line is a good old fashioned battle against all odds to victory. Good movie."
3,HOLD YOUR LINE!!,"This movie is entertaining. The plot is a little predictable, and the acting (including Kevin C.) is pretty lame/corny! There were a few times that the actors could have held their line (dialogue). But, if you're a cyclist, it's a must see! Sit back and enjoy...and hold your line!!"
5,loved this movie,"I saw this movie on TV years ago and loved it. I thought the storyline was terrific. There's plenty of action, family situations, love interest, but, mostly, this movie engages you -- it forces you to care about the characters. It's a great movie. Three words: keep tissues handy!"
4,Since watching this film I only wear Lycra,"The Flyers. What a movie! I was a 14 stone mass of loose flesh until I saw that film now I'm trim. tanned and terrrific. I love Kevin and I cried in Waterworld, but the Am Flys were the greatest. Keep peddlin'."
4,Inspirational (if a bit cheesy),"I first watched this movie 15-years-ago at a sports training camp. It was used as a tool to get us pumped and worked extraordinarily well. It still serves as an inspiration to this day and regardless of the number of times I've seen it, I always feel rejuvinated by the end."
3,Do you know the two actual bike racers in this movie?,"Eddy ""the cannibal"" Mercxx was the person who started the race. They used his nickname for the principle bad guy in the movie when they called him the ""cannibal"".The other real bike racer is the hitch hiker, girl friend of David. Alexandra Paul. She is an ironman triathlete in real life, although that came later in her life than when the movie was made."
5,"A feel-good movie, even if you don't care much for cycling","I've seeb bits & pieces of this movie on & off through the years, so when I had the chance to snag a copy, I did.Not one of Kevin Costner's better known rolls, but still well-played. There's some nice camera work and well-done riding sequences as well.Overall, it's a good movie, even if some of the soundtrack screams 80's, and in this case, it's not a bad thing!"
4,Rocky Balboa on a bike,"If you like 80s feel good movies (e.g. Karate Kid, Rocky series) and you are a cyclist you could not get a better movie.Kevin Costner plays a realistic role as a neoprofessional cyclist encouraging his brother to make a name for himself. I think Kevin must have put in miles on the road to get in such good shape. The movie flirts with fun, romance and some family issues. In the end it is the fight to win against the odds that will draw you in."
3,"Pretty good, especially if you are a bicycling fan.",Kevin Costner (before he was famous) starts in this movie about bicycling brothers. Not bad.
3,Trite and predictable,"I can't understand why so many people like this movie. It's completely predictable (don't worry, I won't give the end away), and works so hard to tug at your heart strings, that it goes overboard. The cycling in the movie is decent, but nothing to get too excited over.I guess, people who really like stories about family coming together, overcoming adversity, and bittersweet endings will like this movie. I got annoyed with how cheesy it was and with the fact that I had the ending figured out very far in advance. I did not enjoy this movie, but I can understand why people might. If you are getting this to enjoy good cycling, forget it. If you really like sad stories, you may like this, but don't blame me if you don't."
1,"""Like New""","Received this DVD quickly, but the ""like new"" condition, was a bootlegged, black and white version of the movie. I was VERY disappointed."
4,Motion sickness,"I think the book does a great job of capturing those day to day situations that we think often, but dont really know how to express."
4,Relatable Poetry,"Terry O'Neal has written a book of poems that most anyone can relate to because she shares heartfelt emotions about the pain of a broken friendship, or how someone who isn't Black cannot know what it feels like to be Black. She's pretty direct, with a teensy bit of a lyrical touch, but her words are still effective. It's an overall nice book of poetry and is recommended."
4,Get the restrictive trigger.,"Good gun, but be careful with it. Has a tendency to double fire with the regular trigger. Thought I was getting the hang of it, until I put a nail an inch and a half into the side of my hand. Got the restrictive trigger immediately after that and have not had any trouble since. I have several nailers and this is the only one that I have ever had a problem with double firing. Do yourself a favor and get the red trigger from the start. Only take a few seconds to change out."
4,Porter-Cable FC350 Clipped Head Framing Nailer Kit,"I borrowed this nailer from a friend because I was building a work bench for the garage. It really kicked out the nails! They went through the 3/4"" MDF and 2x4s like butter. It is a bit akward because of of it's size, but I did like the angled magazine which allows eaiser access to corners. I am looking to pick one up for myself soon, as I have a shelving project for the garage."
4,A NICE NAILER,"I havent had my fc350 long but Its really nice thus far . I bought the combo kit for 449.00 and the compressor does nicelyas well . I have only fired senco 3 1/4 "" nails and so far problem free . I did however install an inline oiler which corects ( I'm too tired to go to get the bottle laziness ). I toenailed without problems even with the rubber toe guard .I ran 80 psi air and the 3 1/4"" nails stopped flush in treated pine which was wet !!!Some say nails are hard to find ( Its due to the nail manufacturers dont all post the boxes as to full compatability on competitors nain guns ). The FC 350 uses 30-34 degree strips . I'm told paslode nails will fire good as well.Get an inline oiler and use QDs on it (I also run an oilesstrim gun and oil will damage it ). I highly advise a swivel on the gun side of your hose ( It reduces tangles and twisted hoses)"
2,GM window crank,"I've tried window cranks from several companies, the knobs at the ends keep coming off. This one is no different. The crank is a little longer you get more leverage, thus, less force on the knob, so, it tends to not come off as often as others. The knob is easier to snap back on than others. Don't waste your time ordering one from LMC, theirs is even worse.Bottom line, if you don't want a crank with a knob that comes off every time you open or close the window, don't purchase this one. Your best bet is to find an OEM unit, new old stock, wrecking yard or someone parting out a truck."
4,Good product,"I bought this for my epiphone Les Paul. It worked great and it provides everything that is required to have a nice and smooth fretboard. I especially liked the 800 grit cloth that comes with the kit to work on the frets themselves. They are shinny now and a hear a lot less buzz.The reason I took a star off is that the ""02"" conditioner was a little dry and it took some work to get the fretboard wet. For what I saw in reviews and other videos this should be a lot more fluid, so it seems the packaging took a toll on mine and could be a hit or miss for this product.Overall I would recommend it for everyone to do a quick good cleanup every 6 months on your fretboard. Your guitar will thank you!!!"
5,good stuff,"A must have for any techs, luthiers, or gearheads who want their guitars to be in tip top shape! Note: unless you know your way around your guitar from top to bottom, read the directions. Used this to bring my buddy's dean back to life....great tool at a great price, plus its hard to find unless you have a guitar repair shop in your neighborhood"
5,The truth about this product,"This product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar. My fretboard hasn't been cleaned/oiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry. The cleaner removed visible grime, the polish cloth shined up the frets, but most importantly, the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel. I am very pleased with the product."
3,"Interesting, but full of errors.","Who wants to use old heroes in his/her own campaign? Some characters might be usable as Major NPCs (as a rulers). I hope that for the next update, writers should READ the novels and AD&D rules before making something. Who have ever heard Drizzt using his ranger spells, even though he cartainly has level and wisdom for that. Drizzt also knows Dragon lore - profiency. Druids cannot be any other alignment than TN, even in Moonsheas. Why has Flight Arrow been marked as a weapon profiency? Etc, Etc... thats why only 3 stars.Sweet water and light laughter!"
1,Poorly designed and made,"the lock/unlock lever can not be pressed easily to unlock the clamp. The push rod from the clamp arm to the adjust screw pops out very often, you have to push it back to its position.Pay few more bucks and get a Stanely or Irwin"
2,Not like the real stuff,"Not that great. After living in Mexico City for nine years and drinking the micheladas there, this does not live up to that standard."
4,vise-grip 10LW,Product was just what I was looking for.Had a hard time finding this item.Product arrived on time and in perfect condision.
4,A Sea Story of Eventual Triumph Against Overwhelming Odds,"Mr. Jackson demonstrates several talents in this, his first book. First, he made me care about the characters. The fact that this was based on a real event makes the murders even more horrific and the courage and determination of the heroine more moving. Second, his descriptive powers made it easy to visualize each scene as I read the book. Third, his handling of dialog is excellent; a good thing as there is a great deal of it. If you like history and if you like stories of human struggle and determination and tragedy, you will like this story."
4,Beautiful movie,"While this movie is a great deal ""Style over substance"", the sheer beauty of the film will keep you on the edge of your seat"
5,Favorite,"This is my favorite move. It's just beautiful shot, has an excellent script, and is made all the more amazing by the wonderful mostly unknown actors."
5,Hidden Gem,"This is one of the most underrated films I have stumbled across. With stunning scenery, amazing acting, a script which somehow blends two parallel plot lines seamlessly, and so many little surprises for those who can recognize the many art and culture references, it is unlike any other film which I can think of. It is especially rewarding for fans of Salvador Dali as it seems to be almost an homage to the deceased artist. It is similar in many ways to the films of Wes Anderson and also Guillermo del Toro; Wes Anderson because of the deep human themes at the root of the film and the ironic way in which these are presented and Guillermo del Toro because of the surreal, fantastical nature of the film."
4,Eye candy with just enough story to hold you in place.,"Remember when you were a child and your parents would read you a story before bed? Remember how you imagination wandered and how the story became more fantastic than the words on the pages? The Fall takes you back to that time.The cinematics are visually stunning, even breathtaking at points. From dramatic wide angle landscapes, to close up personal interactions, the film keeps you held between a world of harsh realities and enthralling fantasy.Underneath it all is a story told from the perspective of an invalid drug addict, but seen through the eyes of a child. There is a dichotomy between the two that allows a magnificent fantasy to unfold out of the real world suffering and blossoming friendship of the characters.You should see this film for the visual experience alone, but it is the characters that will keep you glued to your seat."
5,Can't miss film,"This is a movie in the vein of The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen. It's a story within a story. In the main story, an injured man and a girl are in the hospital together, and the injured man is telling the girl a story.The images conjured up by the story for the viewer are truly extraordinary and reflect the director's truly unique vision and style. Shot on location primarily in India, the outdoor settings are so extraordinary as to appear computer-generated but are mostly real.This movie deserves to be seen in high-def on a big screen. Enjoy it."
4,Remove all expectations...may take multiple viewings,"When I initially watched the film, I didn't like it very well. I watched it a second time (approximately 1 week from the first viewing) and it was better for me.I was anticipating a 'Disney-type' film with a dramatic twist, but find it better if I remove all expectations and simply watch it for what it is...However, I wouldn't consider it a 'block-buster,' merely a film that is good from a 'b-list' perspective.Cheers! ;)"
4,great for the big screen,"The scenery is gorgeous, and the movie is surprisingly funny. The story is not very strong, at times sounding like a children's book (though it is a bit on the dark side for kids), but it is a delight to watch. The costumes, the locations, and the scenes are all so beautiful. It's definitely not a mainstream movie, but if you like visual decadence this movie is a must-see."
4,The Fall,This is a wonderful movie by the artist Tarsem. Lee Pace is amazing in the movie as well as the little girl playing opposite him.
5,The Fall - a breathtaking film,"This is a film like no other. If you expect a deep and complex storyline you will probably end up disappointed but if you want to enjoy some breathtaking imagery and an unusual way of telling a charming story - then you will love this movie.If you were wondering why you invested in a Plasma screen then this will justify your investment !!What puzzles me is the recommended minimum viewing age (16??). My kids, 9 and 12 are totally enchanted by The Fall and i could see no reason for them not to be watching it."
5,Breathtaking,"I have little to add in the way of analysis to the excellent reviews that came before mine, but I'd like to add: indeed, go see this movie, it will take your breath away. Catinca Untaru is unbelievable in her role; the costumes and scenes are of sheer beauty, and the story never predictable.IMHO: a masterpiece."
1,"A dull, pretentious, unimaginably awful ""art"" film.","Good cinematography and a fine performance from Lee Pace can't save this turgid, two hour examination of false teeth and monkey murder under puke green skies with a child heroine whose ""english"" is often incomprehensible.Joining the ranks of one name luminaries, the artist formerly known as Tarsem Singh (now simply called TARSEM) leads vewiers on an often visually arresting but ultimately grotesque and pointless non-journey through the hospital bed stories of an injured stunt man. Its all depressing in the extreme and in the end leads absolutely nowhere. There is no meaning and no emotional involvment and I found it impossible to care about anything that happened in this tedious exercise in excess, depression and ultimately, the emotional abuse of a child. The production is so overblown and in love with itself that it becomes a text book example of style over substance. This is the kind of film Terry Gilliam would make if he had no talent."
1,THE FALL,"THIS MOVIE WAS THE MOST SUCKIEST MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN, HAD TO SHUT IT OFF HALF WAY THROUGH IT"
5,Wonderful movie.,I stumbled across this movie and i was pleasantly surprised. The interaction between Roy and Alexandria was interesting and funny at times and the movie is just a visual treat with beautiful costumes and exotic backdrops.
5,Amazing Journey,"I will admit, just looking at the cover of the DVD case, when I picked it up in Blockbuster, I wasn't very excited about seeing it. I'm not normally one for the strange artsy movies, but my friend recommended it and he said it was one of his favorite movies. So, I went ahead with it.The story follows the very unlikely relationship between a young stuntman and a little girl, while they were in the hospital after their accidents. The girl takes a liking to the young man and he begins to tell her a story about an evil ruler and the journey of 5 men who wanted to kill the ruler. There are plenty of fights, a little romance, and you find out that the stuntman actually has a deeper reason for telling the girl the story.The costumes are breathtaking and the acting was wonderful. This movie is definitly on the top of my list of favorite movies. I recommend at least renting it first, because the movie is definitly not for everyone. But, you should see it at least once."
5,LOVE IT,"This movie is awesome! I even sent my mom a copy for her birthday. Amazon said it would arrive right on her birthday, but it didn't get there until three or four days after the fact.Never the less, this is a great DVD!"
5,Redemption,"There isn't much I can add to the many positive reviews here by way of recapping the plot, so I will only comment upon the sheer beauty of this wonderful, unusual film. You simply must see it on Blu-ray, on as large a screen as possible*. I was mesmerized by it. Add to the stunning visuals the thoroughly heartwarming performance of little Catinca Untaru, and you have one of the most charming, yet mind-blowing, films I've ever seen.*I had the pleasure of watching it thusly on myModel C 106 HDtv format Mw Manual Pull Down Screenvia myPlayStation 3 80GBandPanasonic PT-AE900U Home Theater Projector-- a hi-def video setup that cost me under $2k. You will, of course, still need to spring for an appropriate audio setup."
3,"Built up to be epic, but falls a little flat","This was a beautiful film to look at. Tarsem's work is visually stunning, and looking at the previews I was excited as to what an awesome film this must be. I felt like maybe it could be another ""Pan's Labyrinth"", but mixed with the visuals of ""The Cell"". I was dissapointed because it definitely wasn't that. I loved some aspects of the movie but really disliked others. The real life story of Alexandria and Roy is tender and heartfelt, but when we delve into the fantasy world the story becomes a bit two dimensional. I wanted to love the characters Roy created in his story, but most of them were not very fleshed out and at times the acting was really hokey and wooden. The story was even unintentionally silly at times, like it was almost a fairytale for children and not adults. It was a flawless and lovely world for the eyes, but the subplot wasn't enought to be a cohesive tale that transcends into the flawed, real world."
3,Beautiful,"The storyline was ok, but the film itself was breath takingly beautiful. The colors and locations were worth watching. I only wish the storyline had been better. Its hard to pin point what I didn't like. Overall though, it was worth watching."
2,Doesn't live up to the promise,The previews for this film were filled with amazing visuals. The preview shots were the only good parts of this movie. The story was weaker than the synopsis would lead one to believe.
2,Bimbo movie: Gorgeous looking with no brains,The movie looks outstanding but that is not enough to sit through the movie when the story is awful. There is a reason it did not make much money: the story is missing.
3,I did not fall for The Fall,"The Fall is being added to the shelf of DVDs/BluRays which look great, score great, but then turn out to be not so great...i.e. didn't try before buy...I must admit I was taken with the trailer - The Fall looked like an amazing adventure, with beautiful backdrops and scenery. However, the story just doesn't do much to really grab us and reel us in.More a fest of visual beauty than a great story, it's a mediocre adventure, but hats off to the talented young Romanian girl playing the 'lead'.I couldn't finish the movie unfortunately - I had far more exciting stuff to watch."
3,Overall rating,"Item was bought to work in a tight work area, which it accomplished. However, the quality of pliers construction of poor quality,finish materiel rough. Not up to a USA standard made tool. Overall high cost not consistent with product quality."
5,GETTING A EXCELLENT GRIP,What a great TOOL!What a excellent PRICEWhat a Perfect CONDITIONWhat a Fast DELIVERY
5,"Sadly discontinued, this is a GREAT tool","I bought a couple of these years ago to use on my WorkMates and they are great. Typical quality ViseGrip construction and ease of use second to none. I still have them and won't give them up for the cheap imitations out there. Sadly, when I contacted Irwin (March 2009) about this products availability, they told me they had been discontinued. If you can ever find them anywhere; they are an excellent tool and a perfect third (and fourth) hand when you need a safe and solid hold down."
4,"A fine set, but not a first choice","Solti's Bruckner is very dramatic, less spriritual than other conductors like jochum or furtwangler but indeed a fine set.His interpretations are more powerful and insightful in Bruckner's earlier symphonies. His eighth is my least favorite in the set. He doesn't bring out enough of the hidden, compare it to Karajan or Celibidache. But the best in the set is the 6th. The March of the first movement is so towering that it doesnt even compare to anyone else, and i have the 2 jochum sets, the karajan, the titner, the wand and scrowasowski!....You can't even believe it!...The timpani is so loud that it makes you feel like you are the one in charge of a march entering heaven!All in all, a very good set to start out with. But try jochum or karajan who are far much more mysterious and monumental than solti."
4,Great bag for the money,"Bought this bag on a closeout last year and took it on a section hike of the Appalachian trail. Although the temperatures didn't get down to 20, the bag was great. Temps were down in the low 40's high 30's at night and if I fully zipped the bag I'd be sweating. Comfortable bag, and it does have two loops near the feet in order to hang and dry, so I don't know what the previous reviewer was looking for."
3,"Darker, Sadder","This album seems like one of McMurtry's darkest. I've always liked his gritty style and realistic portrayals, but I thought this CD was a little too negative. Certainly worth owning, but not on the top of my McMurtry list."
4,Choctaw Bingo Is A Hoot,"Sometimes a song reaches out and grabs you... Choctaw Bingo did that to me. Within the first 30 seconds I was slapping my leg, laughing and imagining the characters in the song. James McMurtry has a way of doing that to you with his no nonsense songs that speak of life. Go for this album."
3,One hit album....,"I bought this for Choctaw Bingo, which I thought was incredibe music the first time I heard it on RadioParadise.com, even better when I listened to the lyrics (incredible! -- make crystal meth 'cuz his 'shine don't sell, strap them kids in, put a little bit of vodka in their cherry coke). Unfortunately, the rest of the CD hasn't done much for me (came of to me as kind of standard singer-songwriter fare), so I haven't listened to it much since I got it several months ago. The rest isn't BAD, just not my cup of tea right now, but who knows? I wouldn't write it off as not having the potential of being one of those CD's I pull out one day for the hell of it and I hear something in a new way and it suddenly grows on me."
1,Marginal story with almost offensive language,"I picked up this book in an airport while on a long, unexpected layover, looking for a fun escape. The author supplemented the very typical chick-lit formula with incredibly crude sexual references. Perhaps it's just my American prudishness, but when telling a friend I'm busy at work, I seldom say things like ""I'm tied to the fax machine by my tampon string"". I ended up leaving the book on the plane for the next unwitting sucker. If you are going to purchase chick-lit, look elsewhere."
2,Just okay...,"This book took me a lot longer to get through than most books of this genre as I found it a little dull. I kept waiting for the actual story to start (The ""fake wedding"" isn't really even brought up until about 2/3 of the way through.) None of the characters are particularly likeable and at times I found the ""British slang"" to be a bit disgusting (for example in one scene Katie says she'd 'rather drink a cow's menstrual blood'- not a very nice visual!)I don't think I'll be jumping to buy this author's next book!"
1,Not my favorite,Honestly I just couldn't get that interested in it. I haven't finished it and I doubt I will
2,Dissapointing.,"I thought this would be a good book, but it was a big dissapointment. It was easy enough to get through, but it was a pain. Katie was quite pathetic and the language was just plain horrible. I do not mind some language in a book, but this was just way over the top. Brits are not as crude as the people in this book. Try a differant book instead."
4,Standards Matching,I have used this book in my 4th-5th grade classrooms for the past 5 years. I am so impressed by the fact that it meets so many of our state standards. The materials not only prepare students for the items they will see in standardized testing but also make it fun. In fact I am purchasing a second book because mine disappeared after I suggested several other teachers use it.
2,Okay,"I wouldn't recommend this. Since every state standards differs a little, it definitely didn't help me in my classroom. My students can do some of the boxes, but others they have not been taught yet."
2,Many errors in book,"As a fourth grade teacher, I was really excited to use this book. I really liked it, but in January started having a parent correct the Friday tests. She found one mistake after another. In five weeks' of tests, she found four major errors in the answer key. I have not gone back to check all the work that we did up to that point, but I don't want to use the book anymore. I will not use it next year because I don't want to go through the whole book and grade it! If they get all these errors fixed, it will be a great program. In the meantime, don't waste your money. If you've already purchased it, check your answer keys. Your students could be getting more answers correct than they think!"
5,Eerie and page-turning,"Wow. This author has an amazing ability to get inside of her characters heads- maybe closer than you really want to get. She writes from seven points of view- representing the seven so-called virgins who are taken into the prophet's household. There is lusty sex, mystery, and drama throughout this excellent book. I read it in two nights- couldn't put it down. My bookgroup is going to discuss it next month- one of the BEST book choices we've made."
4,Dynamic Tale for Snow Days,"Jane Rogers successfully captured my imagination in the first two pages and until I finished this novel of women I couldn't put it down. Though the women are all speaking from an 19th c perspective, I was amamzed how skillfully Rogers threaded the timeless issues of faith, self-esteem, the desire for self-expression, the need for love and compassion in such a fashion as to speak to the women and men of today. Throughout the book I saw sometimes tiny, sometimes huge aspects of each women in myself. This is one of the best books I've read in years, don't miss it."
2,"Umm, sure","A sure narrative pull does nothing to hide the obviousness or clumsiness of this tale. Told through the voices of four of the seven virgins a British evangelical has taken into his home, this is an old story of faith lost. The period trappings and subplots into workers' agitation surrounding the community fail to morph into any compelling metaphor for the efforts of the evangelical and his followers to create a better world. The sections ""spoken"" by the brutalized Martha are nauseatingly condescending, and the other three fail to go through anything resembling the journey Rogers so clearly wishes for them. Feels like a wasted opportunity."
3,If you like Oprah's picks....,"The best way to describe this book is ""Atwood lite"". The premise and early telling of the tale are interesting, with promising characters. About halfway through, the book unfortunately shifts into a predictable tale of jealousy and longing. Rather than allowing the characters to develop (which one would expect through the multiple first person perspectives), the plot is pushed forward with clumsy devices. Still, some characters remain intriguing, and the pages turn quickly. This book is ideal for people who are used to reading best-sellers, and want slightly more literary value."
2,"Read ""All You Need Is [ouch!] Ears"" instead.","There is very little here that isn't also in George Martin's earlier and much superior (and ungrammatically entitled, alas) ""All You Need is Ears"". The stories retold are altered, seemingly to jibe with Paul McCartney's relentless post-Lennon rewriting of Beatle history. Veracity aside, this tends to make them banal and humorless.Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,A Great Read For Producers and Recording Musicians!,This fascinating look inside the 1967 Sgt. Pepper sessions is told by perhaps the only insider who attended every recording (with one interesting exception) with a mind unaltered by chemicals.
4,Really Really HUGE book --,"This is a massively oversized hardcover, with glossy pictoral covers, 638 pp; My copy seemed a little bent out of shape for being so huge. Claims over 800 color and b/w photos, just about anything you'd want to know about Dobies; over 5 pounds of book, and prepare for projected expensive shipping costs (really, really BIG book) by the Queen of Judges, Mrs. Nicholas;"
5,Love this book,"I love this book. Has so much information in it and the pictures are wonderful. It is huge. Wish it had a bit more background info to it but is a wonderful book,"
5,Great Product,Salsa was fresh and exceeded my expectations. Have been unable to find this product in my grocery store...so was pleased when I found it online.
3,"Good Selection, but...","This is a very good collection of Edith Piaf's early songs recorded between 1935 and 1947 when her voice was as sweet as a ""little sparrow"". Most songs are from the 1940's. All are remastered mono recordings. However, while the noises have been minimized, I found most of them a bit dry especially those on the first CD. This might be due to the remastering equalization setting that trades off the brilliance of sound for the lower audible noise."
1,Rip Off Alert,Direct Source label is always rotten remakes. Don't support these inferior versions of great music.
3,not agood value,"I do finish work with a big Co. They buy these guns because of the price.I want to do my best work always,I expect the same in my tools, these things are heavy,large,and amazingly loud.They kick back harder and leave this great big hole.The down time fiddling with them long since lost any savings.Not a good value."
2,DA 250A Porter-Cable finish nailer,"I just purchased this nailer and have used it for about 50 nails so far. The hair-trigger is verrry touchy. Bumping delivers just one nail okay, but requires a good aim attaching casings to jambs. What gets cumbersome is the local unavailability of P-C finish nails. Another brand I am using jams badly. The manual is straight-forward in saying only P-C approved nails are going to work okay. I guess I'll try to get them via mail-order. The nails P-C provided with the gun worked flawlessly, so I will adjust to its finicky diet."
4,Great piece of equipment - it really got the job done!,The pump took care of our problem. We now get hot water in 2-4 seconds compared to 30 or more.And it showed up when you said it would.Totally got the job done.
5,No longer waiting for hot water showers,The Grundfos 595916 1/25 Horsepower Comfort Series Recirculator Pump (in our case installed in a separate hot water recirculation loop) has transformed the shower from a three plus minute wait for stable shower temperature to a 10 second (or less) instantly stable temperature saving both a substantial amount amount of water and patience. Wish we had done it years ago.
4,Easy On Your Ears,"This is the debut CD by Chris Casper and Chris Ryan, and released by KIDSIX RECORDS. Most of the cuts are modest, cautious compositions. The cuts allow listeners to sample the composing, singing and accompanying styles of both Chrises. Each lead sings the pieces that they wrote solo. They share duties on those composed together. With one notable exception, the melodic lines are simple but pleasant to the ear. It is difficult to assign musical genre to the pair. You can hear hints of Jazz, the lyric repetition of R&R, vocal 'rounds',doppler sound effectstraces of ""Dr. Pepper"" like tones. Yes and even Reggae rhythms.Cut number eight: TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE is the most complex melody harmony combination and also has the best lyrics. It is with this cut in mind that we can expect EVEN better things to come from this team."
5,"Good Bargain,.Good performances.","David Hurwitz has some fairly bogus reviews here, and tends to be biased against certain performers. Still, he's done a good job here at Amazon pointing out good recordings and couplings that I might tend to flip past at a music store or... scroll past here at Amazon. This one is a real gem, and an excellent value.The Cleveland Orchestra rarely makes a bad recording. Their sound tends to be ""lean"", in that individual detail is the goal. There is still a certain warmth to the playing on this recording, and a level of folkyness. Here we have Dvorak's best symphony (the 7th), his most creative symphony (the 8th) and his most exciting symphony (the 9th) all played with a consistant level of flair and wonderful interpretation. I think this might actually be my favorite reading of the 7th symphony and the filler on the second disc, the Scherzo capriccioso has always been one of my favorites. I'll be coming back to this set for sure."
5,Bravo Cleveland!!!!!!!,"I am a huge Dvorak nut (wouldn't that be a good name for a type of actual nut?), and I am very happy with this recording. I have listened to recordings from New York, Berlin, and even other Cleveland recordings. I have listened to Deutsche Grammophone and RCA red label recordings and others. I must say that this is my personal favorite of the bunch.Though I think other recordings are equal in talent and quality, this seems to me to possess the right balance of somber mood and grandiose epic depending on which movement one is listening to. This version of the 7th is amazing and I have yet to find a Dvorak 7th I enjoy this much. The 8th and 9th are also very good, but I admit there are other amazing versions out there depending on one's preference.This is an amazingly rich and clean recording. Highly recommended."
3,Dvorek at his best.,"Dvorak is always wonderful. The engineering could have been a lot better (very uneven sound quality), but great music by a great composer and well performed."
5,Very nice recording,"This is a very nice recording of these symphonies. I had been trying to find all three together for a while, and I was so happy when I found this. I would highly reccommend it to anyone who enjoys Dvorak."
3,Plain-spoken to a fault,"Dohnanyi produced a decade's worth of recordings from Cleveland that were technically impeccable and yet faceless as interpretations. In concert he is an estimable and even exciting condcutor, but you'd never know it from these plain-spoken Dvorak symphonies. All Czech color has been drained away; these are among the most bleached-out Dvorak readings I've ever heard.Usually it's not fair to characterize a major artist's work with such blanket generalizations, but I can't bring myself to describe any of the symphonies in detail. The opening Allegros are disspiriting, the slow movements cautious, the scherzos devoid of earthy folk rhythms, the finales underwhelming instead of thrilling. Apparently there are listeners who admire what Dohnanyi does here. I can't praise it except as a sleeping aid."
5,Inexpensive and works well,"I bought these to use with my drill press and building with wood. There isn't much to elaborate on, they are C clamp pliers. They were relatively inexpensive and holds my work down tight. The pads do not have teeth so it will not mark the surface. I'd recommend these."
3,so small,"its a nice set but the add didn't clearly state they were only 6 inch set. if id ever need a small one i know where to find it , id have rather had the 10 inch set"
4,Need a clamp?,If you work in a shop these are a tool you have to use at some point to hold something. Have worked great for me
2,too small,"It is hard from the picture and description to realize how small this clamp is. Besides, I found that the price from the local hardware store is much cheaper but it is not worth to return it."
5,Works as a topper clamp,"I purchased six of these clamps to use as topper clamps, so I can remove the topper without any tools. They have never let go."
2,i dont like,"not what I expected the tamoño of the throat is not expected qe seeking out bigger, but for what I need resuelbe me halfway."
3,items were different,"a few of the items were different from the ordered ones, some of them did not have the swivel mechanism for clamping."
4,Must have,If you work in a shop then these are a necessary part of shop work. Many uses and Irwin quality.
3,3500 watt generator,"The engine starts very easily and runs reasonably quite, however when I connected the generator to my R.V. it would not run the air conditioner that is rated at 2400 watts. I turned off all other devices and tried again with no success. I was really disappointed that the generator (rated at 3000 watts) would not handle the a.c."
2,It Never Really Came Together,"I really tried to like it, but found the relationship between the hero and heroine to be boring. I had no idea it would in any way involve a smuggling plot and I've yet to read an enjoyable book with the hero or heroine being a smuggler. :( Also I just didn't like the hero or heroine as people. They are both unpleasant with her being very judgemental and him being very uncaring. I'll admit these are my perceptions after reading the first third of it, I skimmed though until about the halfway point when they get to Egypt, then I just gave up and read the final chapter. I didn't hate it, but I would certainly not recommend it to anyone."
2,The Perfect Wife,"I did not care about the characters, they were all an inch deep. I did not think the plot at all believable. And I think Victoria Alexander took a mental vacation and this book is the result. Poor effort in my opinion."
2,Too Many Characters Running All Over the Place,"This book tried to be too many things but none of them well. It wasn't focused enough for me in terms of either plot or character.If you want smuggling during the Napoleonic Wars, try any of Stephanie Lauren's Bastion Club series, especially ""Captain Jack's Woman.""If you want Egypt, try Loretta Chase's ""Mr. Impossible.""There were too many characters - the devoted servant, the innocent daughter, the loyal butler, the dashing sea captain, the sexually-awakened bluestocking, to name just a few. The hero and heroine weren't very compelling, and their backstories didn't convince me of their motivations.The mystery is not satisfactorily explained at all and the villain conveniently dispensed with.It might have been improved with more fleshing out, in, say, another 200 pages, but the plot would still need some more interesting twists to keep me reading."
4,"A very thoroughly researched, well written book","The topic of Japanese Brazilian migrants in Japan is one that very few people outside of Japan or Brazil know about. I'm glad to see that there was a book written about this issue, especially since it involves the complexity of race vs. ethnicity and issues dealing with feelings of isolation, sense of belonging and cultural acceptance, something which we all strive for. Mr. Hotaka Roth did an excellent job of researching the experiences of these migrant workers and presented them in a very honest way. You could tell that he dove into this project fullheartedly by the fact that he made an effort to not only learn Japanese and about Japanese culture, but that he also learned Portuguese and the different nuances of Brazilian culture. Unlike a lot of research books, this book was not dry and did not drag on forever. It was quick paced and easy to read and understand. It keeps the reader interested and each chapter presents itself with new themes."
5,The best of its type,"If you have a moderate to advanced background in Catholic theology and its history, terminology, and key figures, this book is the absolute best book. It lays out each topic systematically and thoroughly in clear language. I bought a new one to replace my old one. I used to teach theology and give talks and this book was my best-kept secret!"
2,better off buying seperately,"buying the bundle pack is a ripoff...121.99 for the 8 dvds in the bundle pack equals out to about $15.25 per dvd, which you can buy them seperately on amazon for about $5-8 a dvd...i bought all 8 seperately on here and my total was $57, less than half of the bundle pack and i got all 8 of the exact same dvds. i give a 2 just because of the price."
5,Buying this 16 disc collection is the best deal!,"Buying all episodes currently available on DVD at this price is the best value. This 16 disc collection totals 96 episodes, and includes: Serial Killers, Historic Cases, Medical Mysteries, Crimes of Passion, Sex Crimes, Convictions Overturned, Death By Poison and Kidnapping Cases. Buying each set separately costs more, and this entire collection makes a great gift for the Forensic Files lover or for your own library."
5,5 star,"definitely worth the price! shipped over seas and it arrived earlier than expected. if you like csi, criminal minds etc... you will like this! its even better because its real life cases."
3,forensic files,"I received 2 kidnapping videos. . I'm sure that is a mistake.Can you please look into this matter.I received sex crimes,crimes of passion,poisen,serial killers,cases overturned,medical mysteries and 2 kidnapping videos. Also my packages are arriving w/o my last name on the box."
1,Pictures are Deceiving,"I originally ordered this product because I wanted the iron casing to use as a ""cage"" for my son's stuffed animals. I do take blame for not paying closer attention to the description, which says ""Basket Liner"" and that is what I got. NOT WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE! I was in a hurry and should have looked closer, but it would be nice if the picture matched the description. It's not even worth it to return the product because with shipping I wouldn't be getting my full refund."
5,Hard to find liner,"We have had 18"" wall baskets for a few years and it is difficult to find the cocoa mat liners for them. Most wall baskets are of different sizes. I was glad to find them on Amazon. It saved the time of running around to different nurseries looking for them. The liners are of good quality and were shipped promptly by the supplier."
3,"Good glasses, poor packaging","The glasses themselves are very good. However, the packaging is unacceptable. Expect some of them to be broken."
4,Porter Cable MS-200 medium crown stapler,"Excellent product, lightweight yet sturdy enough for the most demanding projects. Have used this product on fence and deck projects without any problems. Easy to load and operate, if a jam happens, very easy to clear and return to work. Uses a variety of staple lengths."
5,Hydor heater is great.,"I recently set up a 25 gallon rimless cube tank. I wanted to minimize what was hanging on the outside of the tank so I purchased this Hydor. After a long search it seemed Hydor was the only game in town for a inline heater. Well, it's great! Takes a few minutes to connect and that's it. No leaks, no fluctuations. I have it connected to my Eheim Ecco. Working for a month now in an unheated room and it is dead accurate and does not fluctuate. As some others noted it does make an audible click when it turns on but mine is inside a cabinet so it really is barely noticeable. Less than the click of a pen. And if it wasn't for that I'd have to check to even see if it's on.Great product, stop looking this is it."
4,"Discrete, can really warm the water well","The inline hose heater is fabulous. My 1st night, I accidentally turned the temp to about 90 degrees, the dial on the unit rubbed against the wall as I was making hose adjustments. I only had 2 starter goldfish who subsequently died but since that once goof, I haven't had a problem with it. I must say that I like less contraptions in the tank."
5,Brand New Must Have,I was looking for it as a gift. Its brand new so of course its in great condition.
5,"Awesome purchase...fast, efficient, and easy!!!!!! VERY HAPPY!","I recently purchased the Hotwheels 35th Anniversary Set: Snake and Mongoose Match Races 1:64 (Purchased on 06/25/2009). I received my order EXTREMELY fast and in MORE THAN EXCELLENT CONDITION. NO MARKS, NO SCUFFS, ONLY PERFECT!!!!This was a gift for somebody and it arrived on time...faster than I expected and this was the easiest transaction that I've ever made online.I would order from here again.Keep up the awesome work!!"
2,very confusing - some details are based on Beta-2,This book shouldn't be sold anymore because its based on the beta version of Visual Studio.NET (which the authors states in the introduction) - so some samples won't run without small modifications which is very confusing for beginners. And putting an ape on the cover isn't very approiate either.I like the authors other books 99 code samples for Visual Basic.NET much better.
3,The author looks intense,"Is this cover along the lines of Wrox where the author/s are featured on the cover.I don't mind the look of this author, although he does look rather intense and he could do with a shave."
5,VERY SWEET Harmonica,"When I got this I was really pretty excited. It was about half the size I thought it would be. I actually had to count all ten wholes (notes/tabs), just to make sure there were really 10. The gold plated model is gorgeous, awsomley small, great feel and quality, and sounds really nice. This thing sounds as nice as just about any 100$ harmonica out there by Hohner or Suzuki. On top of that you get 2 harmonicas in one. It's a really nice piece. You will really enjoy playing and looking at it. It will fit anywhere."
2,Bloody Puck,"This product exudes a good enough sound when played but the edge of the instrument is sharp so when I played it, I was bruised by the instrument. Otherwise, it's 'okay' for a beginner."
5,Great Gift!,"I bought this set of glasses for my parents for christmas, and they aboslutely loved them. They shipped quickly, and had plenty of buffer time before the holidays. They are very fragile, but if taken care of, are perfect! So far we have only broke one, but I would definitely buy some more if need be."
5,ACDelco 15-73469 Heater & Air Conditioner Control Assembly,"I am a DIY person and I am rating the stock replacement ACDelco 15-73469 Heater and Air Condition Control Assembly. It was very hard to figure out which was the correct unit that worked with my 2005 Chevy Cobalt Four Door Sedan as some of the units fit the Saturn's etc.. But, after some work figuring this out the unit I bought is a direct replacement for my car and it is working great. Installation is not so hard but if you have not preformed this type of replacement I would not advise you do try it without some good instructions and You Tube video on how to disassemble the dash etc. This will keep you from making a broken mess of the dash trim parts."
4,Great Album,"A wonderfull collection of Abkhazian Songs, a must for every Abkhazian, or anyone near to Abkhazian Culture. Disturbing was just the fact, that Abkhazian Songs were put together on an Album with Adjarian (Georgian) Songs. But over 20 great Abkhazian Songs let you forget about this minus!"
3,"Cool, controlled Mahler -- shades of Boulez","Chailly's Mahler gets such positive reviews here that I can only shake my head and suppose that a lot of listeners like cool, controlled Mahler. Why? Then I remind myself that Pierre boulez takes much the same approach. He's more original than Chailly, because often Boulez's phrasing has never been tried before. Chailly does everything that's in the Mahler tradition; he just tamps it down a great deal. The first movement here will be a touchstone for anyone testing this CD. If you don't mind that the pacing is calm, unexcited, and steady, Chailly will be satisfying. To me, however there is no point in restraining such a passionate, conflicted composer. I'll stick with Bruno Wlater and Bernstein in the First."
3,Good for other things,"This vise-grip does not prevent the rounding of seized bolts, it rounds them off, and almost ruined one of the flare nuts on a brake line.However, it does pinch cut-off brake lines very effectively. It effectively stopped a drip, while I worked on the other end of line"
1,Received Rotten!,"Bought as a Christmas present and when recipient opened jar, was rotten and had to be thrown away (which recipient NEVER throws anything away!)I wish I could share a better story, but this is the truth...just be careful what you buy online."
5,Pliers With Attitude!,"These work great for any needle nose application, but the tip is a little bulkier than a non-locking plier. The locking mechanism is easy to operate; just grip the object with the plier and tighten of loosen the screw until the lock closes. Remove the plier and tighten the screw another turn. Now, when you regrip the object and close the jaws, it will ""snap"" down and lock.If you are gripping a bolt end-on, rather than sideways, the jaws will flex slightly when you twist the bolt. The release lever lets the object loose with a pinch on one handle.Every tool box needs an assortment of vise grips for survival. Add these to your collection, you never know when only a vise grip will do."
2,Raid driver supplied on floppy for a board with NO floppy port,"If you are building a system, don't get this board if you are planning to use XP (any flavor) or need/want a floppy drive on the system. Give me a break Intel! This board doesn't support such ancient technology as a floppy disk drive!! What I found really funny is that the board comes with the raid drivers supplied on a floppy. Intel made my system build a little more difficult. 12 USB ports is nice, guess I'll be using a lot a them!"
5,Solid P38 Board for 45nm CPUs,"This is a workhorse board for someone not interested in spending $200+ for the X38 chip set and wants the upgrade path to the new e8000 and q9000 CPUs. Yes, over clocking is not a feature but then we are not paying for a board to OC to begin with."
4,good,dp35dp is good board but don't have floppy drive connection is bad for install window XP. no proplem with window vista.
1,"Is this an Intel mobo or a PC Chips mobo, I can't tell the difference.","This motherboard is another failure for Intel.The board does not support floppy disk drives, yet the RAID software is included with the motherboard package on a floppy, this is absurd.I needed to flash the bios on this motherboard and guess what, you need a floppy disk drive in order to flash the bios but the motherboard doesn't support floppies.The Intel Windows express bios software would not work because of a ""internal programming error"", there is no bootable .iso bios software on the Intel website for this motherboard, but intel provides files and provides links to websites that instruct you on how to make your own bootable .iso image to burn a bootable CD in order to flash the bios. Absurd.Also, Intel does not provide a boot record for the .iso so you have to copy a boot image from a bootable CD in order to make your bios flash CD bootable, this is absurd, and I haven't been able to make this work."
5,Vivid & Magnificent Recordings of Enigma & Planets,"Monteux's renowned 1958 stereo recording of Enigma Variations still sounds fresh today. His reading is deceptively simple at first, but this is a kind of performance that leaves vivid impression and warm poetry deep into your heart after repeated listening. Karajan's earlier stereo recording of Planets is equally outstanding. Both recordings have very open and expansive sonority of early stereo era, beautifully remastered without losing warmth of the original."
5,An engaging and intriguing literary work...,"The Darkest Shadow is an engaging and intriguing literary work and spiritual allegory. The thoughtful character development made me feel like I was part of the story, like I knew each character personally. The intertwining plot lines really pulled me in - once I started reading I just couldn't stop...CS Lewis and Tolkien fans take note, this is the next big fantasy series!"
4,solid brad nailer,"I bought this nailer after being disappointed with the performance of a Bostitch nailer. This is better made, a little heavier but has been reliable and not misfired at all.It shoots a variety of nail lengths and does what it says on the box. Amazon sells this item at a bargain price."
5,Top of the line!!,"Great brad nailer, very quiet, and the perfect weight. Perfect for trim work and even starting those first rows for hardwood flooring."
5,PC BN200A Brad Nailer,"I have used this with 1 1/4"" brads so far, been 100% reliable. Easy to use, good product."
1,waste of money,Never sets nails to the same depth.You will need a nail set and a hammer to use this gun.Now it shoots every second nail.I replaced it with a Senco nail gun.
1,very dissapointed,"I recently bought this gun at the Home Depot. The first gun I had leaked air out of the exhuast port the first time I used it. The second gun shot a nail every other time I pulled the trigger. I am not impressed by this gun, and would not recomend it to anyone. I will never buy another Porter Cable nail gun."
1,This game is total garbage..,The designers of King Kong could not care less if their program works or not. This is the single most buggy program I've ever owned. Its worthless.
2,Just a thought ...,"Why is it that UbiSoft designed this film-based game so that the gamer plays as Jack Driscoll, a more or less supporting character albeit a male. The real hero of Peter Jackson's film is a heroINE, Ann Darrow, whose (unlikely) heroism is defined not just by number of rescues but by the measures of her heart. Sure Jack saves her from Kong, but did Ann really want to be saved? I admit, it'd be weird to play this game as Ann, but being forced to play as Jack is right away a turn off from trying this game. So I havent tried the game, having been turned off by this fact, and the player reviews here are terrible. (I rated it two stars arbitrarily.) I'll be waiting for the DVD, instead..."
2,impossible to control,I thought I had quite an advanced spec computer/graphic card.. clearly not. the mouse was all over the place. Joystick unusable. I could not customise the joystick buttons - logitech extreme 3d pro. The game action had no bearing on the joystick movements. So overall just too frustrating to control hence never got into actually playing the game so can't comment on the game itself. And like the user said below about trying to quit... still trying to quit after 5 times of clicking OK.. I really want to quit!
1,Not worth your time!!,"Stay away from this game, unless you enjoy playing error prone poorly programmed video games. I have a high end PC that easily meets the requirements to play both the retail, and the high-res downloadable version. This game is pathetic. If you want King Kong go see the movie."
1,PETER JACKSON'S KING KONG,Do not buy this game does not work with windows vista. Some times window XP games will play on vista but not this game. Live and learn!
2,Looks great but....,"This game looks great but it isn't. The graphics are awesome. Unfortunately, that is all that is awesome in this game. Controls for Jack and especially for Kong are awful. The game is extremely linear. You must follow in the direction of the game. Forget about exploring skull island.Save yourself forty dollars or try Serious Sam 2 (way more bang for your buck)."
1,Dangerous Virus included,This software contains copy protection that will slowly ruin your cd drive. Thank Star-Force for their copy protection that does this. It slows down your CD/DVD burner until the hardware stops working. Do not buy this game
2,Not a reference book,"This was a very disappointing book. The book basically talks about how the Viper went from concept to production. There isn't a lot of specs and virtually no pricing data. And the specs that are discussed, you have no idea what year the author refers to. Some of the pictures are blurry and again you have no idea what year of the car pictured. When the author talks about years, it more like pre-1987, 87-2002, and 2003. This book will not do much for you if you are trying to research a purchase of a Viper."
4,Enjoying the Series - Learning New Things Even about Old Cases,"First of all, I have enjoyed watching the series. I have learned a number of new things, even about old cases. I enjoy the scientific approach, which is important to figuring out the cases.I miss the introduction theme music from season one and I miss them getting together back at HQ to wrap up each show.Production wise, I do think the narration could be tightened up a bit. Many things from the previous segment are repeated in the next segment. This is a bit frustrating at times to watch. Most of viewers have a reasonable memory and don't need to be reminded of what happened in a past segment into the new segment."
2,Good anchovies but it's easy to find better.,I thought it was a pretty good deal but I was not used to eating anchovies with so many bones and such a flabby texture (I prefer firmer). You can find way better and cheaper at Treader Joe's without having to buy 25 packs.
3,"Com Si, Com Sa...","Meaning just average at best. Cheap, though. Helped in a few pizzas but far from the true delight of the best type of anchovies. But hey, what did I expect? I read some other reviews praising these anchovies and since the price was very nice and the amount 25 cans I bought it. That is how much I do like anchovies but there are much tastier anchovies out there. I know it and now all I have to do is finish this shipment and pay more money If I want the best, not a whole lot more, really. 3 Stars at the most."
1,nothing,"I have not received this product, or any notifications that there was a problem with anything concerning payment or shipping."
1,NO original recording's!,"This CD had no original recordings. They are new stereo/studio recordings performed by the orginal artists. They all used computerized music, and even the singers sounded computerized, especially Lesley Gore singing It's My Party.Please find something better!"
5,Love this series!!!!,"This is one of my favorite FX series. The content is so raunchy at time when i first saw it i couldn't believe it was on a regular cable channel!!!! This box set isn't a traditional set put together by the manufacturer themselves, but was a steal for the price seeing as though the series just ended and box sets won't be available for some time. all of the seasons were shrink wrapped together and all in great condition. the only complaint i have is that the series is over!!!!!!!"
5,Remarkable soundtrack!,"It's hard to find out a soundtrack so delightful and more precise than this one. Karaindrou was highly inspired with this composition . If you conside the dimension of the movie , this soundtrack was at the same level . Arresting and above all captivating melodies . The leit motive runs in almost all the tracks. An unforgettable experience."
4,Interesting book,"One of these really big books people are afraid to read. It contains a wealth of info, with the most interesting stuff found after the middle of the book (personal opinion). It covers a great period of time, which would normally not allow for an in-depth look in the issues discussed. However, Fuler, manages to give not only an in-depth presentaion of his subject, but a good analysis as well. I would readily recomend the book to anyone interested in strategy and its association with national policies. Really interesting book."
1,You Won't Get What You Ordered,"I just received this product after waiting several weeks for it to be delivered. I was very disappointed to find that the specific song that drove me to order this CD was not on the CD.The cover art for the CD as it appears above is identical to the art on the CD I received however the song list is mostly different. The song I ordered this CD for is listed on the artwork above and is shown when I click the ""Listen to Samples"" link but the song isn't on the CD.I'm a music collector and as most collectors do, I ordered this CD because it contained a specific song I wanted to add to my collection. Very disappointed to receive a CD with songs I already have.Save your money."
4,Shakti with John McLauglin,"The third Shakti release is fairly similar to the first two. East meets West as John McLaughlin leads us into his unique world of fusion. Johnny M is (in my opinion) the best guitarist going today(or ever), and is beautiful to listen to him and L. Shankar (electric violin) play off one another while Z Hussain lays down some funky East Indian beats(see also...""Shakti,with John McL..."" & ""A Handful of Beauty"". If eight or so Mahavishnu Orchestra releases are not enough for you then Shakti should be the next logical step. All hail Mahavishnu John McLauglin!"
4,Shakti,This showcases John Mclaughlin's virtuosity on the acoustic guitar.I'm a guitarist and am totaly in awe of his abilities.If you appreciate Indian music this cd is a must.
2,"If You Like Indian Music, Why Not Listen to It?","Ok. Right. I Get What Shakti is doing, but its not Indian music, and its ridiculous for anyone to think that McG ""mastered"" Indian music. This is a fusion of lots of things, including some Indian sounding music played on the guitar, and some more actual Indianish music played by musicians like Shankar, that are real adepts at the genre.So this is nice music, a little simple, but nice. But i would rather listen to Nikhil Bannerji, or Shankar playing actual Indian music. And i would rather listen to the Mahavishnu orchestra, or McG playing western music. But that's ok. This stuff is nice."
4,Not English,"Is there a translated English version? My DVD arrived yesterday, and while the classical sounds are different than Rock Symphony and very beautiful, his words are not understood. It is not English, as stated in the description of Legacy Live in Baden-Baden. Seeing him on DVD is much better than the cover portrays however, and his talent and skills are over the top. I wish I could understand his words or knew before I ordered it that was not translated by sub-titles. The language should be changed on the description."
5,Grab it!,"These are great pliers! If you have a frozen nut, these are the tools of choice. The will securely grab a hex nut (within their design range) and will not slip. The stub will break first or the threads will strip! No more rounded nuts. Use plenty of penetrating oil! Only kevetch is that the finish seems below that of the previous #4LW I bought when they first came out. Is Vicegrip production gone off shore?"
3,A crystalline third is offset by a rather dull 6th,"This is Sibelius to the core. Blomstetdt and the SF Symphony seem to take seriously Sibelius' comment that while other composers served various cocktails, he served pure spring water. There are no dramatic excesses on this recording, or on any of Blomstedt's Sibelius recordings with this symphony. He opts for a cool, clinical approach which can yield both refreshing results and dull ones. The take on the third symphony is marvelous. It is played with a purity and conviction that makes the lush romantic music that was being written at the same time by the likes of Strauss and Skriabin seem simply overblown. The second movement is particularly beguiling. However, the same purist approach makes the 6th fall flat. In a convincing performance, the 6th can seem to be Sibelius' best symphony, but in this case it simply seems anemic. The purity of sound does make for some nice moments, as in the opening, but for the most part, it is a dull performance."
3,Sibelius goes through the Blomstedt blandizer,"Because lavished incredibly good sound on Blomstedt and the sFS, I have bought quite a few of their recordings and had high hopes for this one. Although born in the US, blomstedt's career has been Scandinavian, and he should be a natural at Sibelius. Alas, this was a neurtral, unimaginative reading of both pieces, as neutral as a lot of his Mendelssohn and Nielsen and just as boring."
1,Damaged on arrival,"I purchased this product as a gift from a bridal registry. When I received the product, I could already hear the broken glass in the box. The product was not packaged properly for shipment. Therefore, I had to return the product and purchase a gift elsewhere which was stressful because the bridal shower was coming up and i had no gift! The only good thing was the ease of returning but otherwise, purchasing these glasses was a complete waste of time.. Moral of the story-- BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT PURCHASING FRAGILE ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER!"
5,Outstanding book for new or experienced supervisors,"This book is outstanding, especially for human service professionals. The writer gives real-life examples that anyone in the field can relate to and utilize."
3,It looks too much like a regular doll.,"I'm pretty obsessed with chucky so thats my reason for buying it in the first place, but it looks too much like a regular plush doll. My cousin's 2 yr old daughter runs to him like he's a regular innocent doll and thats no good lol. I gave it 3 stars because its still a good addition to my chucky doll collection."
5,Next Teen Idols,"I bought the CD and I loved it! The music was awsome! I can't believe these guys are not played on the radio. Not only is the music great, but those guys are hot! Hook me up!!!!"
5,A very good book,"This is a very good book because:1. It doesn't contain cheap fillers such as JavaDoc References, and repeating things endless etc. For people new to Eclipse chapter 1 gives an introduction to Eclipse: it's very to-the-point.2. It's very comprehensive. From testing (PDE JUnit) to creating your preferences pages. It's well organized.3. The length of the code snippets is ok (not too long (filler), not too short). A lot of code is supported by screenshots to explain the code/text.4. It's just complete!ONE WARNING: This book covers a pre-release of Eclipse 3.0 and NOT Eclipse 3.1. A reprint of this book is expected in april 2006 (according to the publisher's website). If you can't wait: just buy this book. It's really good. If you can wait wait for the 3.1 edition because some things are changed in Ecllipse 3.1."
5,must have,"Looking for a book to start with using Eclipse and writing plug-in for the Eclipse platform,this is a must read book. The book is up to date with the software, easy to understand, and much more. I highly recommend this book to anyone would like to get involved with Eclipse."
5,Excellent,I bought the same thing from a Chevelle web site and it looks identical as the more expensive one. I am very please with shipping and product overall!
1,worship feast taize songbook,"i was unable to look inside these books, and when i got them i discovered that they only have a melody line, no parts included in the songs. i had purchased them for choir use and am unable to use them. i tried to do the return thing with amazon, got no response from amazon, which was disappointing.if this is reviewed, i would certainly like to return these books and would appreciate a message from amazon since i thought you stood behind the products sold.i think it is misleading to have to buy music without an ability to look at one page of what is actually inside the book. it is a pain to have to try to return a product, as i have stated."
3,"Nice songbook for worshipers, but needs some work","This is a songbook for worshipers, not written in parts for a choir. Melody line and chords are included, and recordings of the the full songs are included in ""Worship Feast: 20 Complete Services in the Spirit of Taizé"" (http://www.amazon.com/Worship-Feast-Taize-Services-Split/dp/0687741912/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z) for those who are interested.My chief complaint is that the lyrics of two of the fifteen songs are illegible, due to a printing error. This may not affect all printings (mine is 9th printing, 2012). The songs are #13, Sing Praises (Laudate omnes gentes), and #14, Stay with Us (Bleib mit diener Gnade)."
1,Not worth it.,There are very few songs in this book and no chords to help. This is supposed to be 4-part harmony. It's more like a children's book.
5,worship,"I think the Taize book is a wonderful addition to faithful, and reverent adoration of out Lord. It is too bad so many others do'nt take the time to sit and listen to the chants and play the music. It is very relaxing and truly brings you closer to God."
3,Even better than the original.,"American Ninja 2 is a lower budgeted sequel, but it is better than the original. Dudikoff is back and so is his muscle bound partner Steve James. The story is entirely laughable, but Dudikoff kicks but in the action lead. Again I enjoyed American Ninja 2, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone except fans of B-Action movies or Golan-Globus fans. This was the last good American Ninja entry, 3-5 don't measure up."
4,The Best of the series,"Michael Dudikoff and Steve James return for Action as they must stop a drugdealer from creating super-ninjas.this is the best of the series which contains humor and action to keep you intrested,but it's ok to buy if you love action movie,but if you love Art your better off renting."
3,WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR WORK,"On the plus side, the soundtrack is by George Clinton which gives the film that ""Miami Vice"" feel. On the remote island nation of Blackbeard Island U.S. Marines who guard the embassy are disappearing...being kidnapped by ninjas who dress all in black and never stand out. Two Rangers are called in to replace the marines and find out what is going on, Curtis Jackson (Steve James) and Joe Armstrong (Michael Dudikoff) who contrary to his anme fights with his feet.The movie is 80's corny. The fight scenes are over choreographed and done to music that makes the fighting ""light"" in nature. No one owns a gun so they all fight ninja style. I enjoyed the film as a campy look at the 1980's. As a stand alone film, it is passe.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
3,"These are just ok, poor fit.","I picked up a pair smalls for my two small dogs that weigh in at 11 and 14 pounds. The quality is acceptable and shirts should be good for multiple uses. I did not find the fit very good, the collar opening seems to be to big, thus the shirt hangs back on the dog too far."
3,Could be better,The design is the same but the manufacturing is not. I have three of there same 11R regular tip vice grips that are old and made in USA.I bought these and they are made overseas and right out of the box the adjustment screw turn like crap. I applied some grease to the threads and they still stick and turn very hard. To me it seem like the threading machine was off by a few thousands and that was OK for there quality. I will not buy again and will look for other manufactures and give them a try.Outsourcing is great for america and quality products
5,Vise Grip 11R 11-Inch Regular Tip Locking C-Clamp,These were recommended by a senior mechanic where I work. It is a very good product that does exactly what it is designed to do. I plan to purchase more as finances permit. You just can't go wrong with the Vise Grip brand Locking C-Clamp.
3,"A fun toy, but not worth 50 bucks","I am pleased with the look and operation of the machine. Also, this company shipped it very quickly. I would be completely happy if it was about $25 or $30. In addition, I was charged about $10 for shipping because the package was supposed to weigh 10 pounds per the product specs listed above. The fact that it was supposed to weigh 10 pounds influenced my decision to buy this product because I thought it would contain more metal than plastic (not the case.) I weighed the bank in its shipping box when it arrived and it was barely over 2 pounds. If you're in the market for one of these, buy the cheaper all-plastic models."
5,kellys review,this was a great book with lots of interesting facts. It helped me a lot with a report I had to do for school.
2,Not worth adding to the library today,"This book, published in 1992 shows how hard it is for medical or surgical textbooks to stand up to time. An atlas of common complications the book fails to integrate any coccepts regarding patient selection and peri or post operative management that are relevant today. It touches on most of the common issues, and offers suggestions but the lack of depth in each text and the widely used phrase, in my opinion, or in my practice do not go beyond superficial analysis. I can see how this might be interesting to a novice or an outsider to the field of cosmetic surgery, but the sophisticated practitioner will find little of use today. On the positive side the book is profusely illustrated and could be used as an education tool for the patient with unrealistic expectations....show a couple of these complications to the eager patient and they will proceed, as they should, with caution."
2,"Good tool, but I would not recommend it for pro use.","I'm a contractor and I use this Porter Cable Brad Nailer for kitchen cabinet remodeling and refacing 4-5 days a week all year around. This is my first Porter Cable Nailer and probably the last one (I had many different brands in a past and I still have one Craftsman nailer). After just a half of a year of use this Porter Cable Nailer started to fail when I used 5/8"" brad nails. It misfires and jams the nails. I've tried to find out why and found that inside nail slides are a little bit wider than they must be and 5/8"" nails move up during the use of Nailer and this causes the problem. I've tried many different brands of 5/8"" nails, but result is still the same. It still works OK with the other types of nails. Not the best design!!!"
4,Light nailer,"The product has operated fine, except that the safety has to be just so.. If you are doing some fine moulding it doesn't always fire. The package was missing one part that I wanted most and that was the cushion on the tip so it wouldn't damage your wood.."
3,Plastic parts,"I have a Porter Cable brad nailer (BN125A). Recently the cushion ""plate"" - a small plastic tiem - broke in two. I rarely us the nailer. I glued the parts together and put the cushion plate back. It wiggled around loosely. I was originally expecting a rubber cushion - I guess PC is trying to reduce costs. Seems silly - I would rather pay a few dollars more and get something that was more reliable."
5,Wonderful brad nailer,"I have owned this tool for about 3 years. During this time I have used it to build furniture, install various sizes of trims and mouldings, and construct a number of craft projects.This is an exceptional tool, I have shot thousands of brad nails with it and it has never once jammed or failed to perform perfectly. If you have no need to shoot brad nails longer than 1.25"", this nailer is perfect. Aside from this nailer I own several other Porter-Cable pneumatic nailers and have been very pleased with all of them."
5,Porter-Cable BN125A Ga. 18 Nailer,Very pleased with item. Shipping was excellent and the discount was given as promised. Custimer service was a pleasure to work with. I'd use Amazon again.
1,Paid higher price than I could have bought this item,"Paid too much for this item. I ordered BN125 for $97.00 Was sent BN138. I had to notify this Ace store and request a refund because they were selling the BN138 for $67.00. They did no have the courtsy to let me know the reduced price of $67.00 They kept quite and I had to ask for the refund. Meanwhile this Item BN138 was selling for $45.00 everyplace else. Do not buy from this Ace Hardware, they should have notify me of the reduced price instead they kept quite. This company to be cautious of is (ACEHARDWARE. I WOULD BE CAREFULL WHEN DEALING WITH THIS COMPANY)"
5,Awesome!,"I was a bit afraid at the beginning...I love Berg, Webern, Schönberg, Wellesz...But Krenek sounded weird...Maybe I'm getting weird myself, this symphony is awesome.Martin"
1,Round Magnifier - 5 inch Lens Size,"This was a cheap, flimsy, poorly made item. The lens fell out as we pulled it out of the box. We thought we could just pop it back in place, but there was not even a groove in the frame for it to pop into. It became clear that if we wanted it to stay, we would basically have to rebuild the frame, or glue/caulk it permanently in place.Terrible, terrible, terrible."
5,The Guide,"I have had the opportunity to read this book and I would recommend it to anyone very enthusiastically. It is fast paced, exciting, scary, easy to read and hard to put down, and beyond all that (as if that isn't enough) it has plot twists that are unique. I found this book so interesting that I had to finish it the day I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down. This is a really excellent book!"
1,very disappointing,"Save your money. This is the worst CD I have ever purchased. Not only is the music bad the music is unclear. I am going to wear this cd around my neck, I am sure it will ward off evil sprits. R. Spearman"
4,"Not what I expected, but very enjoyable","I was expecting a more recognizable jazz basis for the compositions. It may be there, and possibly my ear is too insensitive to detect it. But, it is an enjoyable CD, nonetheless, made particularly appealing by the inclusion of an Albert Glinsky composition. I didn't actually look at the tracks on the CD before I bought it, so it was a pleasant surprise. I thoroughly enjoy his music, which is woefully under-recorded, and this CD was therefore an uncommon treat. Ignore the title, buy the CD."
5,good,"Vice Grip makes the best locking plier type clamps available. Other brands wear out, don't clamp good, and are of inferior quality."
1,bad,this product doesnt work. i plug it in and it does nothing. i thought it was too good to be true cuz its really cheap. dont waste your time.
2,Doesn't explain Benjamin Banneker properly,I forget how exactly to spell Banneker but here's the important thing. The book does not explain that BB was a hybrid. He was one quarter white and english. Three quarters african was he. The article on him leaves one with the impression Banneker was all African in ancestry. wrong! America's capital city was partially designed by a man of mixed black and white background.
2,Sad Story,"I would not recommend this book. The seller was excellent, but the story is not something you want to read to your children in my opinion, and it is written as a childrens book."
5,The best of the Venezuelan's folk music,"Venezuela is a country with a lot of influences, black, eureopean and indians, and it's folk music is same as it's people, a mix of influences. Vasallos del Sol, learnt to play and sing these music from ancient people, they went to the towns to learn all about typical and folk music and they play the music with the same soul than the people who grows up playing and dancing these music. A small review of venezuelan music, Vasallos del Sol, six stars to you..."
5,Excellent and healthy,"I have looked locally and cannot locate sardines packed in tomato, let alone the nice small sardines. These are absolutely delicious and I am very happy I selected the autoship option."
3,Salty sardines,"True, I am not a person who loves huge amounts of salt on everything, but I found the salty taste of these overwhelming. Despite the tomato sauce, they also felt dry. Go figure!I will try the olive oil version next."
5,Amazingly Crown Prince,"These are the best tasting sardines I have ever bought yet, but I am looking forward to the spiced one and give it a try...I am thinking of trying the most talked about spanish sardines with hot green chili in oil...."
1,Poor feature coverage,I understand that this book can be useful for new users but it is certainly not a bible ! I was mainly interested by StarImpress & StarDraw components and they are very basically documented.
1,God blameless; Boyd blameworthy,"When an author has to resort to retranslating Bible verses to make his points, he loses me and credibility. When an author asks rhetorical loaded questions: ""Is God to Blame?"", what else can the hapless reader answer but ""Of course not!"" But the reasons given why God is ""off the hook for evil"" are shallow and unsatisfying. They appeal to emotions but appal the intellect and the spirit, to say nothing of Scripture's own consistent witness.Is the author to blame for absolving God of responsibility for 'gratuitous suffering', 'meaningless tragedy', 'unforeseenevil' by eviscerating or surrendering His Sovereignty?John Piper has a more Biblical and soul-satisfying approach in his books. If you are leaning toward Boyd, you owe it to yourself to get Piper's perspective where the Bible is never retranslated, but allowed to speak for itself without presumptive editing of Holy Text."
5,I have to read this book!,Wow! Someone found this book so threatening they had to review it 3 times in a row? I've found Greg Boyd's other books fascinating. I can't wait to read this one.
3,Wrong price?,"I bought this car last year at my local toy shop for $4. I think something's wonky with Amazon's prices, because several Brio items are outa-whack."
3,Brio makes plastic??,"This train car is absolutely cute, but let me tell you how disappointed I was when I got it and discovered it was plastic. Guess next time I need to do a little more reading about the item before I buy it. It is still a great car, and my nephew loves it, but why did they need to make it plastic?? That's why I went with Brio - I thought they made everything in wood!"
5,Fun!,A wonderful mix of songs that are a ton of fun to listen to. Skye seems to be a combination of Shirley Manson and Belinda Carlisle and the music is worthy of her singing voice.
4,Giordana Mens Laser cycling shorts,"These shorts fit great just enough padding so that it does not bunch up between your legs.The picture is misleading in what you actually get,the photo shows a blue shorts with someblack trim at the bottom.I recieved a black shorts with a blue panel on the side."
4,Track Listing and recording information:,"1. Breakdown - 3rd take No Dubs 2. Time's Up - 1st take Guitar dub 3. Boredom - 1st take Guitar dub 4. Friends Of Mine - 1st take Guitar dub -""All recorded 'live' Indigo Sound Studio Manchester 28.12.76"""
5,EXCELLENT all around,"What an awesome CD! Nice ballads. Great upbeat ""dance""-type tunes. Great assortment. Lyrics are really ""meaty"". ""Her Eyes"" is one of the most beautiful love songs ever written - really sung from the heart and looking for God direction. My 17 year daughter and I don't agree on all music, some, but not all - this was one we definitely both liked alot - musically and lyrically. Title track had us dancing around the house."
4,Hornady Lock N Load,"THIS IS AN EASY TOOL FOR RELOADING,I SHOULD HAVE FUN USING IT AS I LIKE TO RELOAD ."
4,For every Little Helper,"My 7 year old daughter received this as a Christmas gift, she loved the idea to be able to do something ALL by herself. I helped her very little and she enjoyed every step. The only thing I would change about this is to have MORE cups. We had to find extra cupcake cups to use all of it. Other than that, I am sure she will be asking for this kit again!"
1,The closing part of pliers is too long.,"The large mouth of the pliers is very good, but for my purposes, the closing part of the mouth was too long, about 1/3"". They were big and heavy and sturdy maybe OK for heavy work."
4,Easy to set up and store,"What surprised me about this ""poster"" was that it came in a little box folded up. Because it's made of fabric it's very light, doesn't crinkle or tear like other posters and its easy to fold up and store again if you want to move it. Not much else to say."
4,Cuatro de cinco,"¡Preciosa!, exelente del Monaco, MAGISTRAL Simionato, una muy suave Tebaldi, que aunque no es exactamente lo que se necesita como Leonora, se nos hace imposible no apreciar, y un lamentable Savaresse. Giorgio Tozzi está muy bien. Por lo tanto, ¡cuatro de las cinco estrellas se merecen una estrella!, ...cierto... la ópera es un todo, pero es que no me puedo resistir. Erede, como siempre, muy correcto y muy cobarde."
3,This is definitely not Persepolis,"My first introduction to Satrapi's work was Persepolis 1 and 2 which I thoroughly enjoyed. She managed to convey depth in spite of the simplicity and brevity inherent to the genre. The illustrations cleverly complemented the ingenious dialogue. I approached Embroideries expecting more of the same and was sorely disappointed. Embroideries does not really have a point, it seems more like random ramblings about men and none of them are particularly clever or profound. The book has a disjointed feeling and ends abruptly. None of the characters are developed (as she did in Persepolis) and this is one of the reasons why the reader cannot connect to the characters or subject matter (because neither are developed or focused). It seems that she could have written this in one day. Hopefully Satrapi's future work will maintain the level of excellent she displayed in Persepolis 1 and 2."
5,Hilarious inside peek,"From an opium-smoking grandma, to folk remedies involving chai and keys, this illustrated novel is a great continuation of Satrapi's previous works. Readers receive hilarious inside glimpses of the rich and varied lives of Iranian women. My only wish is that it would have been longer--it ended far too soon."
3,Snapshots of a women's world,"Marjane Satrapi does it again. She uses her sharp vision and simple graphics to describe a world many of us could never see - the view behind the door in a sexually segregated society. As you might imagine, there's plenty of well-deserved male-bashing, as well as frank and earthy discussion of boob jobs and vaginoplasty (the stitching hinted at in the titular ""embroidery""), love potions, and other things us men might be better off not knowing, at least about our own ladies.Too bad the term ""cinéma vérité"" has no equivalent in the world of graphic novels, since that's what that is. I'm sure the conversation, as drawn here, never really happened. I'm equally sure that all of its parts did. It makes for a fascinating glimpse into a culture I'll never see, even if the graphic style isn't exactly my thing.- wiredweird"
5,Great.,"I loved the book, it was brand new and just what I expected to receive. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
4,Best graphic novel yet,"(Cautionary note: I'm not really a graphic novel fan. It's just not for me. I have it ingrained in me that comic books are funny. I have a difficult time accepting serious graphic novels. I know, I know. It's just me. Apologies.)I must say, however, that I seem to be warming a little to graphic novels, mainly through my reading of this author. Her books aren't quite as jarring to me as most graphic novels I've read, the conversation bubbles are not so strikingly inane.While this may not seem to be a hearty recommendation, this is my strongest endorsement of a graphic novel to date."
3,Not bad humorous short graphic novel,"Marjane Satrapi is the author of widely known graphic memoir ""Persepolis"" (which I am yet to read). Looking through my library catalog, another title of hers caught my eye - ""Embroideries."" Naturally, I was captivated by the synopsis - ""gloriously entertaining and enlightening look into the sex lives of Iranian women"" - and had to check it out.Well, the book didn't quite live up to this synopsis. You will not find any explosive or controversial details of Iranian women's sex lives. Rather, it was a collection of anecdotes about relationships with men and customs of the country presented in a cartoon-like way (it is a graphic novel). It was entertaining and light-hearted. If you are not familiar with the culture, you will find it to be an interesting glimpse into the lives of Iranian women. If you already know something about Iran, reading this book of anecdotes is not a bad way to spend an hour, just be warned that there are no new mind-blowing revelations in it."
1,I read this in 8 minutes!,"I'm not kidding. I really did read this in 8 minutes. I timed myself. This book was such a disappointment after Persepolis I and II. I recommend reading it in the library, not buying it. It definitely doesn't contain the substance and originality of the Persepolis series. A real let-down.It's basically a series of anecdotes about things the author heard her female friends and relatives say about men, sex and marriage. There's nothing new, unusual or original in any of these anecdotes. For example, there are several references to how to fake virginity on the wedding night. This sort of thing has gotten to be a standard thing to mention in books about Muslim women. I find that books that offer a voyeuristic view of Muslim women's sex lives seem to sell, sell, sell, and that is probably how this book got published. ""What's behind the veil?"" is such a tired gimmick."
3,A fly on the wall listening to old crones,"Marjane Satrapi, who earned her fame writing the graphic novels Persepolis and Persepolis 2, continues in the genre, retelling the stories overheard from the women in her family. Reading it is like being transported to her parlor, as they gossip about the good and bad (mostly bad) of the men in their lives.The book's primary strength is Satrapi's relentless honesty in reporting what she sees. Weakness of characters as well as strength is portrayed. What is essentially a book of feminine sisterhood across generations also highlights personal fraility.That said, the brevity and shallowness of topic make this significantly less moving and worthy than either Persepolis novel."
2,Short and somewhat shallow..,"I agree with other reviewers in that 'Embroideries' is somewhat disappointing compared to Satrapi's earlier works, namely the first 'Persepolis.'It is an incredibly quick and easy read with uninspiring and hurried art. The topic is never really delved into, and women are difficult to distinguish from each other. The cover is lovely, but not lovely enough to warrant purchasing this hardcover work.Ultimately forgettable and relegated to the 'best-borrowed-from-the-library' category of texts. I look forward to Satrapi's next (and hopefully more successful) work."
4,"Good read, but way too short.","I have read all of Satrapi's entertaining, educational and revealing books. Embroideries is all those things as well -- the only shortcoming is the length of the book -- the ending is very abrupt and you feel that there is much more to be said about the subject. Nonetheless would I recommend this book to anyone who liked Persepolis 1 & 2"
3,Ventilations of the Heart,"In Marjane Satrapi's latest graphic novel, she joins her mother, grandmother and girlfriends as they swap stories of love, sex, and heartache over a hot cup of tea. From escaping one's arranged marriage to the perks of plastic surgery to even becoming a virgin again, ""Embroideries"" seems to cover everything you really want to know about Iranian women but was scared to ask. Perhaps too much information is provided, ranging from the kinky to the downright unpleasant. But it doesn't take away the appeal found in Satrapi's other works; the veils just come off this time around.This comic is unrated: Adult Language, Adult Situations."
5,Are women happy with their lives?,"You really really have to read this book no matter who you are, if you are reading my comment about this book that means you are going to buy this book. Alright then, peace...."
4,Marjane Satrapi is a trip...lol,"I liked this book. If you come from a large family of women (like myself) then you could relate. The black and white drawings may not seem fitting to the context of the book's story, but it's not a bad read. I just wish Satrapi had made the book longer. Gossiping women usually make for a good read but the book leaves its reader wanting more."
1,Unexpected Quantity,"This is 4 Mars bars, not 15 Mars bars.From the""Product InformationBrand: Mars barItem Package Quantity: 15Manufacturer: MarsCountry of Origin: Gt Britain""and the math $11.99 ($0.80/item), I expected 15 Mars bars.The Product Description reads ""The original Mars Bar from England, milk chocolate with soft nougat & caramel center. Each bar is 2.3 oz. You get 4 bars in a pack. ""I thought they were selling Mars bars from a shipment of 4-packs. Instead they are selling 4 Mars bars. Don't understand the ad as I did, be aware this is 4 Mars bars for $3.00/Item."
5,A Great Christmas Present!,"My mom thought the Mars Bars did not exist anymore... until I bought a four pack for her for Christmas. She loved them. I have not tasted a mars bar, and I probably won't for a while longer. I want my mom to have all of them. She loves them, so, they must be a fantastic product!"
3,Retro candy,"I bought theses for my friend.She said they are not as she remembers. The original had almonds on top. I ate one and liked it. I'm younger than her and don't remember these.I see they are comparing these to Snickers almond,yummy."
2,Difficult to use,"I've used Insider's Guides for individual cities; this is the first I bought for a region. Insider's Guide to North Carolina mountains divides the region into 3 sub-regions, and then by county in each sub-region. Restaurants, accommodations, shopping, activities, etc. are all grouped together in individual chapters, thenw those chapters are grouped by subregion and county. So there isn't, for example, a single chapter on Asheville giving you some history, city layout, neighborhood descriptions, restaurants, accommodations and activities. To find Asheville listings, you have to jump from chapter to chapter (e.g. restaurants), find the ""Central Mountains"" section and then the Buscombe County sub-section. Its tedious and lacks flow. I much prefer guides that group all resources for an area together. Yes, the information is here, but you don't get a good overview. It feels more like a telephone book than a narrative travel guide with listings."
4,Plant A book review,"The Most interesting thing was that when butterflies are sleeping their proboscus is tucked under their head. The most surprising thing in the book was that rose hips have ten to one hundred times the vitamin C than any other food. Plants is an excellent book. It told alot of interesting information. Anyone would like to read it, for a report or just for fun.By B. Carlson"
4,100% Whole Grain breakfast,"These make a good on-the-go breakfast. They don't taste like 'health food' whole grain, and don't taste like refined wheat (white bread or other breakfast bar options)."
2,Watch out - there is high fructose corn syrup in these cookies!!,Doesn't that kind of cancel out the benefit of the whole wheat flour? Please explain why there is a need for the high fructose corn syrup anyway....something that is known to be harmful to you.
4,Whole Wheat Fig Newtons,These are really tasty - a little different from the old tried and true version. I was a little overwhelmed with the number of packages we received - we'll have fig newtons until Valentines Day ;) Which is probably the point of order food this way..I think.
5,Excellent movie. Even better than I remember!,"I saw this movie many years ago at the theater and I remember being fascinated by it. I recently tried to find it in Paris and after visiting many stores selling both new and used DVDs a store manager told me it was never made into a DVD (At least in France anyway)! I checked on amazon to see if someone is selling it used and to my great surprise I found the canadian version brand new and shrink-wrapped! No english subtitles but I would recommend it anyway. If you do not know french find someone who does and watch it with them. You will not be disappointed. Unlike other 70s movies which hold a better memory than they actually are, this movie is even better than I remember."
5,EXCELLENT,"This is a kind of movie that many watch but a few can really SEE what is the more important. The more important is that the movie shows experiments that indicate how far a normal person can go if he/she is blindly obedient to someone in power. It is part of explanation, for instance, for the nazi soldiers obedience to nonsense and criminal Hitler's demands. Good to be seen by educators."
1,No English subtitles,"I watched this movie while back and since then I always wanted to get it on DVD, this DVD quality is good, but there is no English audio or subtitles!!It is not written anywhere in the product details that it has only French language, so if you don't know French don't buy it, it is a waste of money."
5,Excellent !,"I comme Icare est une pure merveille du cinéma franais avec un acteur d'exception.C'est bien sr la version d'origine, ce qui implique une image viellissante et un son d'époque mais le DVD vaut quand mme le détour.Dommage que la France ne soit pas capable de sortir ses propres films en DVD !"
4,"Good Overall, but Caveat Emptor","When I first sprayed it on, the first scent I noticed was hairspray and a light feminine floral scent. I really thought I was going to hate this and was disappointed for about 30 minutes while the fragrance dried down. But as it dried, an amazing fragrance developed. It is nearly impossible for me to describe, so consult with Kenzo's website for the exact details on all the notes present. Think lake water with a light lemon peel shaving, in the best possible way. Never overwhelming, but you know it's there.When you see me cruising my yacht around the Mediterranean, this is the fragrance I will be wearing."
1,WD-52528 off to poor start,"After 4 months the bulb blew. Mitsubishi did send out a prompt replacement under warranty, but this raised reliability issues on a $300 plus part that is supposed to last years. Had intermittent problems with TV locking up and not responding. Then after switching from HDTV antenna to cable or DVD the screen would get green pixels flickering. Had to unplug set to clear it up. Went out to service and after two weeks it just got back. Service was vague about what was wrong and only said that they had to reset some settings. Hopefully this will work. Set does have a great picture and many features. As with most new TV's the set up is a little confusing."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD! There is something wrong with the way it was manufactured. I bought one through Amazon.com and two from Collector's Choice Music. ALL THREE COPIES are DUDS! The entire CD is muffled and scratched and you cannot hear or understand anything being played. Rhino put this out, if I'm not mistaken, and they did a horrible job on recording it. SAVE YOUR MONEY! DON'T BUY THIS CD!"
4,wish I could keep using this!,"After just a few days, this product made my skin look really, really nice (smaller pores, more even color)... except for the little zits that kept popping up. I'm only 25 and was more interested in the smoothing properties of the retinol than any wrinkle-reducing action. So if your acne-prone days are behind you, I'd encourage you to give this product a try. As for me, I'll have to keep looking."
4,Digital delay in a solid receiver,"The one primary feature I chose this unit over others was the digital delay. HDTV takes a lot of time doing video processing and the result is that audio and video can be disturbingly out of sync when playing DVD's. Setting the 5940's delay to something like 130ms brings the audio and video in sync for me with my Sony SXRD TV and Sony DVD player. Unfortunately, the delay is buried several menu options down and doesn't have an on/off function, only a time setting. So it cannot be switched off for TV and on for DVD by my integrated remote control.Other than that annoyance, it is a well functioning system with a great variety of setup adjustments to tailor its performance in a home theater system. There are a lot of preset sound processing settings to pick from with remote control buttons.All in all, the unit works great for me and the price was excellent for the features. I waited many months for the silver unit to match the rest of my equipment."
1,"Bloody Pooper Scooper, or the dog is really quite dead","I rented this because it was being touted as some direct to video masterpiece. While it was definitely a direct to video release there certainly wasn't anything masterful about it. We get a story of a loser screen writer doing the bidding of his dog, which involves bloodshed. On paper it sounds good. Execution wise, not so much.If you're a fan of voice over in movies you should probably check this out, since the majority of the film contains it. Believe it or not crazy people talk to themselves, hell sane people talk to their dogs.When it comes to cheap Horror movies I'm pretty much a dumb fish, chompin down on anything that moves. More often than not I don't like the taste. Sometimes I end up needing shots.If you have poor short term memory check this movie out. Hopefully, for your sake, you'll forget all about it."
1,Misogynistic Garbage,"Murdering women is not entertainment. If you were to make a movie murdering kids or black people everyone would call it garbage but for some reason it's ""okay"" to do it to women.When are people going to wake up and see that torturing women is not entertainment."
4,"Here Lucky, *whistle*","I really did not know what to expect when I rented this bad boy, but having a sick fascination with B/amateur horror I decided to pick it up. The story was so twisted you couldn't help but laugh! But it wouldn't be nearly as enteraining if it wasn't for the dry, and quick wit of the main character and his narrations. His submissive persona and completely oblivious views of his character's slow spiral into dementia are priceless. It reminds me of a twisted version of ""The Wonder Years"", except in this one Kevin kills Paul and Winnie and buries them in his backyard."
3,"Booze, broads, and necrophilia galore","This is a seriously twisted work. It is one heck of a dark comedy that is bound to make those of us with the toughest of stomachs feel a bit queasy in parts. You've all read the other synopsis', so I won't recreate the wheel. Rent only if you can handle some grossness."
2,Lippincott Medical Terms and Abbreviations,"I bought this book because I have no medical training or background and am currently taking an on-line medical transcription program that I have many more questions that the programs offers materials on. I was looking basically for a medical terms ""for dummies"" and a book that with a lot of medical abbreviations. The course tells me to make my own list and as I don't have a lot of time, I figured I would be better off buying a book. If this is what you are looking for, this book is not for you! It offers some basic terminology and I found nine out of ten times, I couldn't find what I was looking for and resorted back to Dorland's Medical Dictionary.The one thing and only reason I would recommend this book, is at the back of the book are Roots, prefixes, and suffixes and their meaning in an alpha sort. It would be nice if they would have told the reader which category the word falls under, but I have that down pretty good now."
4,kits musings,Messing with Mac is the last of a closely linked trilogy about 3 friends. Book #3 is just fast paced I completed it on a rainy afternoon. Strong characters and humor mixed with a delightful love story.
4,Great Snack,"The box arrived on time, very easy company to work with, will order from them again. My tutoring children truly enjoyed the snacks."
2,PASS THIS ONE BY,"100 Calorie Packs Ritz Snack Mix, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)I ate one pack of these and decided that just because I am watching my calories it does not mean I have to eat food that I don't like. The taste of this item was very unpleasant. If you want something good try the Ritz 100 calorie salty and sweet snack kettle mix, absolutely delicious. These 2 items look similar but when it comes to taste they are extreme opposites. One is awful and the other is delicious."
4,Almost perfect,"I love the style of these items. The chrome is good, and they really help dress up an engine. The only bad thing I could say is that the rubber rings don't last very long. In just a few weeks, they get hard and break and fall off."
5,Great Product!!!,"I started back into the martial arts and the thin Tabi socks just didnt do it for me. My feet would literally slip inside the shoes. Tried these and love them. Not only are they very sturdy, they're also comfortable and very absorbent. Will be purchasing more soon!"
5,Great product!,I bought these Tabi socks for my roommate and they really are awesome. He doesn't just wear them with his Tabi boots... he wears them everywhere. They are really durable and they wash up nice. I am very impressed with the quality. Thank you for making such a great product.
2,A failed attempt to be a sexy adventure flick,"Six foxy women with a teen girl go undercover as they are trying to take out a drug kingpin's operation of selling dope to many kids as they have a van with high tech weaponry and sexy outfits.Despite starring Jack Palance, Peter Lawford and Mr. Magoo's voice Jim Buckuss, Alan Hale Jr., this would-be rip-off/cash-in on ""Charlie's Angels"" is just a terrible misfire ready to be burned out of your mind. The women aren't even attractive, the action sequences are poorly done with cartoon sounds and the plot is average. Now the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version improves this movie greatly."
1,LOST IN TRANSLATION,"I am sad to say that I was compelled to read this book. I cannot understand how it could have gotten past and editior. The spelling, gramatical, and poor writting methods leave one to think where did this person go to school at.Anyway, the only thing that catches your interest for a meek minute is the introduction. Then it's all down hill from there.I certainly hope the sequel to the book is filed into the circular bin.Reader"
1,Never Shipped,"For Christmas, we do gift exchange by picking names instead of buying the whole family presents. This is the only thing my brother-in-law wanted. Due to ""an error in the inventory system"" I was unaware that my item had not shipped until the week of gift exchange because they did not have any in stock (like their advertisement said). This item was supposed to be delievered between December 2 and 5. An email today said that they couldn't confirm a delievery date but would guess it would be between 1 and 2 weeks... not to helpful with gift exchange on the 11th..."
3,A split decision--spectacular sound but humdrum performances,"If only Skowaczewski could inject more life into his conducting. His versions of the Shostakovich First and Sixth Sym. are exactly alike: a humdrum sequence of events without emotional conviciton, the low point being the end of the Sixth's first movement, which comes close to sleepwalking.The recording would be pointless except for the amazing sonics. The Halle had sounded amazingly good on a live Billy Budd under Kent Nagano (Erato) a few years ago, and if anything they sound better here. The orchestra itself isn't first rate, but somebody has figure out how to record them with superb presence, detail, and impact. So if you don't mind literalist readings of the music, this CD is of demonstration qualaity sonically."
5,Outstanding Book,"This book is helpful and wonderful in reminding us that God is in control of every situation. The photography throughout the book, which was done by the author, is also a beautiful reminder of God's magnificence in the world. The book is easy, quick reading but still has a powerful, profound message to deliver. I recommend this book for everyone."
5,God Is In Control,"At three quarters of a centry old I have struggled more than somepeople with health issues, broken relationships, loss of family and work members. I only found peace in my faith and God never failing me, however, I frequently failed myself by not waiting on Him to answer. This book helped me stay on track."
5,It's a REBOL-ution. Carl Sassenrath has done it again!,"Forget Perl. Forget Java. This is it, guys!This book says it all.My worst programming nightmares are *over*.REBOL is what I have been waiting for. REBOL runs on 40 platforms with no modification needed and puts out complete functionality in less than 200KB. I'm continually amazed at how powerful this language is and the networking capabilities are amazing.This language is incredibly easy to learn because you can actually read it. The hard part? I am having a hard time getting my head around all of the great things it does. Incredibly robust.I cannot imagine an Engineer, worth his salt, not having this book."
2,Not what I have in mind :(,"I got this book for about two weeks now and I skimmed through the whole book in a two day period. To summarize how I feel: I still love Rebol, I am still eager to read more, but just do not want to read this one. I do not want to say that this is not well written, I just feel that it is not for me. I think it spend WAY TOO much on the example online database application (and not a single word about possible use of other DBMS!). I think Rebol User Guide is a better reading than this. Chapter 4 - Chapter 6 is a nice introduction section for beginner though."
3,It ain't perfect,"No, it isn't perfect ... but try to find better hardcopy documentation for this less-than-mainstream language.Sure it's all about command-line application development, but it works, and the examples are sound.If you dig deep enough online you can find other tutorials/examples for REBOL that you can probably live without this book -- but why should you? It's cheap enough in the new/used category (I got my copy for under USD 3!). Don't pay full price.It won't teach you all the visual stuff (command line, remember?), but it will teach you enough to get going.There are worse manuals out there."
2,Mediocre book,"It's unfortunate that one of the first printed books on Rebol isn't a better introduction to the language. The organization is very strange -- I found myself well into a chapter wondering why I was where I was -- it seemed that the authors only wanted to show some very interesting features of the language with convoluted examples. I wish the examples were more ""universal"" or ""routine"" rather than building a whole system with Rebol.I would seriously consider waiting for another book to come along. It's too bad that this book weren't more like other introductory books, like Learning Perl (O'Reilly) or Programming Ruby (AW), both of which are excellent first-texts for learning a language."
4,rhodesia,"slow talking, informative, interesting, at times, I don't need to know the speaker's sexual preferences, a bit of sci fi, whether you believe it all or not is your preference!"
2,I'd rather chew glass. . .,"I'd much rather be chewing glass then have to sit through this nightmare of a video again. Some of the information given is great, but that does not justify the paint drying flavor of this doc. I am going to torture many of my friends with this one of a kind reptilian treat. 25 minutes in, I would have welcomed any ancient reptian being to come down, chop me up and use my entrails as natural caseing to stuff the rest of my body into to feed Zulu Shaman Credo Mutwa and Mr. David Icke. Sorry Dave."
1,Are these people for real?,"Why is it that conspiracy theorists always seems to misspell key words and write in all caps?Besides, everyone knows that ""reptilian"" thing is pure hoax -- the reality is the world is controlled by evil metamorphic cockroaches from Arturus. Kafka was only half-right."
3,The Reptilian Agenda - Decent,"I thought the first 2-hour disk was excellent. Credo explained who he is, his experiences with and beliefs about a 'reptilian' race and extra-terrestrials. However, getting into the next 2-hour DVD I was disappointed because Icke did not ask Credo open-ended questions that would allows us to ascertain whether Credo was being authentic or not. Instead, Icke would 'set-up' a scenario based on his research into the above subjects, then ask Credo ""is this correct."" Sometimes Credo looked surprised at the question, but answered in the affirmative. Sometimes he gave an answer that did not directly answer the question. I repeat, I was very happy with the first 2-hour DVD because I got a good feeling for Credo and his experiences with the 'reptilians' which I do really believe exist."
2,Limited,"I really loved ""College Algebra: Solved!"" so I expected to love this title as well. It turned out that it just is not as useful. Many of the problems I encountered in trig wanted exact solutions with radicals and pi. I couldn't get that from this software. It always gives me a decimal. The steps also never seemed quite right. I had used the college algebra title to teach myself algebra, but I could not have even hoped to do that with this one."
1,Disappointed,"Entering problems is an incredibly tedious and time wasting exercise, even that would be worth it however if the program could actually solve the problems you put into it. Will it solve problems containing complex fractions with multiple radicals? Absolutely. If you need it for something more such as trigonometric identities then you will be wasting your time and money on this. Out of about 20 attempts with different identities, this program can solve maybe 2 out of them all. The rest it simply gives an error or says there is no solution which is not the case, that is after taking about 5 minutes of attempting to calculate it before it does this. This program may be useful for some of the more simpler Trig problems, but don't count on it at all for anything that is more difficult."
1,Waste of money,"Who ever programmed this apparently knows nothing about Trig identies, not much more than a pretty face. I purchase the big package from Bagatrix and haven't found any of them as usefull as ""Algebrator"" was for Algebra; total waste of money."
2,NOT sugar-free,"I am puzzled by the tags and reviews which state that this product is sugar-free - it is not. The first ingredient on the list is sugar, and there are a total of 22 grams of carbohydrate per serving. I am actually a fan of this brand of horchata - it is really very tasty when prepared with Splenda - but this product listing is a bit misleading. The disclaimer is all well and good, but perhaps the ""sugar-free"" tag ought to be removed?"
3,Make your own,"This stuff is ok, but it's so easy to make your own from scratch it's a waste of money. Google ""horchata"" and there are a million recipes!"
1,Not worth it,"I really enjoy getting good horchata having traveled throughout Latin America and many Mexican restaurants in the US. For the most part, it's a hard drink to mess up if you make it yourself; it may not end up being amazingly delicious, but definitely something worth drinking. When I saw this drink mix in the store, I figured I'd give it a try.Suffice to say that I was supremely disappointed. I tried it with water, and no amount of drink mix could salvage it from tasting and looking like dirty water. Blech... With milk, it got mildly better, but I would much prefer a glass of milk to the nasty, plastic-y taste this added.Stay away! Look up recipes yourself or maybe try one of theImagine Rice Dream Horchata, 32 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6). (I just ordered one, so we'll see how it turns out!)"
3,A Good Novel- But Not Really About Troy,"Let me rephrase. It is about Troy but Brisies spends most of the story talking about her home in Lyrnesso and her life there. I was expecting more of a love story-or just plain story!-about Brisies and Achilles as the back of the book implied. I was at first disappointed because Brisies is a superficial character who likes too talk about how many people have had sex with her, and desire her. Then I decided to reread the novel knowing not to expect some great trojan war story, and I liked it a lot better. I thought it was a good novel with a nice plot. However if you are looking for a novel that is about Achilles and Brisies you have come to the wrong place. Overall a good book but the title is misleading."
5,Good read,"Interesting continuation of the story of the gang from 5th grade on. I read these when I was younger and since I am a collector, I wanted to have the whole series."
4,Elsie's story continues,"This is the fifth book in a series, though this and the fourth book didn't have too much to do with the first three books. The first three - 'Fourth Grade Wizards', 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade', and 'Sixth Grade Can Really Kill You', were set in elementary school, but the last two books focused on Elsie Edwards.Elsie made her first appearance in 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade' and was in the next book, though with a considerably smaller role. Here, she's seventeen and no longer fat after losing weight in the fifth grade. But she still has plenty of insecurities (as shown in the fourth book) and this book is geared for older readers, but still rather good if you read the rest of this series."
4,Greatest Bass this Century,"If you buy this CD, do it because of Cesare Siepi. His gorgeous basso voice is perfect for the role of Figaro. He is clear and emotive at all times--and besides what the person above me said: Figaro is a bass role; he doesn't sing ""thickly"". That being said, the rest of the recording is weak, with no one even coming close to Siepi, or any other stars for that matter. A great buy for fans of Cesare Siepi!"
2,Highly Overrated Performance,"I was very unhappy with this performance. Let me explain why. Though Cesare Siepi can be enjoyable at times as Figaro, he sings far too thickly for the part. Hilde Gueden sounded a bit mechanical at times as Susanna, with little emotion, and Alfred Poell as the Count sounded rather weak, always either ahead or behind the orchestra. Lisa della Casa was the only really good thing about this performance, who gave a very sweet Countess. Suzanne Danco's voice shook as Cherubino, and the tempos were a bit too fast. I would not suggest this cd."
5,Ingrid is a genuine talent..check out her glorious beginnings!,"I couldn't resist being the first to review Ingrid's first (well, I think it is her first, anyway). As my title says, she is a genuine talent who has a great gift for simple lyricism and melodies (well, I don't know if the melodies are simple as I have no musical capabilities, but they sure are gorgeous). She takes the complex and makes it serene and beautiful."
4,82 Songs of the Sixties,"this classic book includes 80 faves from the 1960s: Angel of the Morning * Bridge over Troubled Water * Cabaret * Different Drum * Do You Believe in Magic * Eve of Destruction * Georgy Girl * It Was a Very Good Year * Monday, Monday * People * Spinning Wheel * Walk on By * more."
5,One of the greatest recordings ever made,"I simply cannot believe this great recording has not been reviewed yet. Unless you only like the most serious of classical music, this CD will delight you. The performances are simply spectacular, especially the Chabrier pieces. Conductors like Ansermet do not appear very often. He made his orchestra sing. Every phrase sounds just perfect. It is a shame this CD has apparently been deleted but I suspect it will come back on a different Universal label. When it does, make sure you buy it."
3,Identification Difficult,"I found it difficult to evaluate the type and condition of a bayonet using info from this book. Mainly it is not easy to visualize the markings, tone, edges, etc. from illustrations. Photos give a better ""picture"" of the piece."
4,Good egg noodles,"I ordered these since one of my favorite recipes involves egg noodles and I have been unable to find them down here in Mexico. I could not believe the prices of some of the other noodles, who pays $20 for noodles? Anyway, these are good and get the job done. Husband and I tested them a few nights ago and they had a good flavor, I will buy them again."
4,Spicy Jelly Beans,These Spicy Jelly Beans are difficult to find in our local stores. I was thrilled to find them and they came quickly after I ordered them. My family loves these flavors and it was a wonderful treat. I will order again from this vendor.No problems at all.
4,Not for Scholarly researchers,"This handy edition of Cassell's German Dictionary is just that: a handy edition. And although it contains many idiomatic phrases and other helpful tools, it is not designed for those who wish to do scholarly research in German literature. The text does not contain enough technical terms or theological idioms to facilitate this type of research. For those who intend to use it for more casual study, this text would be highly recommended."
4,that's a lot of oysters,"The Crown Prince brand has been one of my favorites. I like their oysters not just for the price (at the local grocery store) but as well as for the flavor. Though here at Amazon, buying a pack of 24 oysters at once might be a bit extreme...."
3,In depth but complex structure,Directed at mechatronics students this book was written for the exclusive purpose that the professors at our university did not find a suitable book for their courses. Although the book is packed with information for some students it may be a bit hard to read.Consider this book to be heavy on the mathematical theory of the subjects covered.
5,Stellar,"A beautiful album, dripping with emotions: longing, irony, cynicism, sarcasm, love (yes, love), anger, humor. And Ute Lemper transmits those emotions like no other performer I know. At least some of the song writers/composers fled to the US to escape Nazi Germany, and had distinguished careers here, too. The songs are beautiful, with meaningful lyrics that aren't just the blindingly obvious ideas and sentimentality offered by a lot of recent ""political"" songs."
5,Un disco de primera categoría.,"Sencillamente extraordinario, la maravillosa voz de Ute Lemper nos hace vivir unos momentos de fantasía y alegría indescriptibles. Muchas de mis secciones musicales terminan con éste maravilloso disco (Obviamente que lo tiene que comprar cantado en Alemán). Es uno de mis discos favoritos y tengo más de 2.500 CDs.300% RECOMENDADO"
3,Know its limitations,"I recently used this tool to staple a screen mesh under the eaves of my house. When shooting staples downward, it worked fine. However, it did have significant problems when used to shoot staples upward as the staples tended to fall down in the holder and they would not always advance or they would often cause the stapler to jam.One jam ultimately completely froze up the tool and I had to return it. Also, the design of the staple holder could be better. It was very difficult to close at times and often became stuck open requiring disassembly of this portion of the tool.I attribute most of these problems to shooting staples upward however.If you will use the stapler often, I would go for the higher quality/cost model."
4,Porter Cable 18 1inch crown stapler,"I just bought this tool locally about 2 months ago and I have to say no problems to speek of. I am used to my Senco brad nailer being so quiet and smooth compared to this little thing sending out a big crack when you pull the trigger, I guess I'll get used to it. All in all the gun feels good in my hand and all the controls are well placed. You can't go wrong for the price. Wish I could give it 4 and half stars."
3,Crown Stapler,"This is the only pneumatic stapler I've owned, so I can't compare it to others. However, after using the stapler for over a year for a variety of tasks, I have found the tool highly satisfactory. I've not experienced any jams. The tool is light weight, comfortable to hold, and easy to use."
4,Surprisingly good movie,I ran across this movie channel surfing and was quickly swept in. It's a little of The Joy Luck Club meets Guess who's coming to dinner!
4,Worth the money but be aware..,"I really liked this cd. The extra tracks are pretty cool. I just want to say to those who don't know what is on the cd that the first 13 songs are the same as the US version of their first cd ('N Sync). All the bonus tracks are available on other singles and import cds as bonus tracks. If you are starting to buy those import singles, you may want to wait on this cd until you get the others. ""Sailing"" (live version) is on the U.S. GMHS cd single. ""More than a feeling"" is on the 'N Sync BMG import (their real 1st album). ""Sundreams"" is on a few of the singles as bonus tracks like the Together Again single. And the last two songs TUMH (phat dub) & IWYB (back beat radio edit) on one of the 4 single imports for them. I hope this is the kind of feedback you were looking for! By the way, the ""Thinking of you (I drive myself crazy)"" single is sooo well worth it! It is one of their best singles w/5 versions on it."
5,Awesome book,"This is a great book about a cat finding its way around during the world war. It gives the cats view of what is going on. Has excellent details and is extremely interesting! I recommend this book be read by everyone...Blitz Cat is a great story with a great plot, it goes through an enourmous range of emotions, and is a definte must read!"
5,very good book,this book was very good. It was a compeling story of a cat named lord gort who tries to find his way home. He is many miles from home and he makes his way throught many sad and rough parts of the war. On his way he meets many people of all ages and shares his story. I would recomend this book to many people of all ages.
3,"Comme ci, comme ca",This book is a pretty good source of low carb info but not informative enough for the reader who wants to know the ins and outs. I would recommend Life Without Bread over this book if you want to read one excellent low carb diet book.
2,Disappointing,"The basics of low-carbohydrate eating are covered - no problem. It's the application of the basics that is disappointing. For instance, the meal plans are ridiculous. Hardly enough for breakfast to keep a bird alive, much less functioning. And then heavy on the protein for dinner, when most of us won't be needing it."
3,Not for long life,"I used it. It was good in the begining, but not for long term. It is slow, noisy, shakes a lot and make a turtle noise. Not good."
3,"Rehearsal to the ""Noah's Ark""","""Ski Trip"" looks instantly as some rehearsal to the ""Noah's Arc - The Complete Second Season"", of which much longer dialogues and self-confessions make this sometime-in-eighties produced movie much less entertaining.Of course, relationship intrigue inter-linkage, scarcity of explicitly and not-so-much music played have to some extent been compensated with the New York City views although of a low-budget filmmaking."
1,Forget it!,"Without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. ""Boring, tedious and unfunny"" applies here in spades (no racially offensive pun intended, since most of the characters are black). There isn't even any nudity in this one to make it worthwhile.There was one line that made me giggle. Our hero, who is turning 30, is having a turning-30 crisis. (Remember when turning 30 was a crisis!?!) He tells his lesbian buddy, ""I found three gray hairs this morning."" She says, ""Corey, you're bald."" He says, ""Not there!""But tell me, why does every gay movie have to have at least one obnoxious, offensive, screaming queen? The beautiful Haaz Sleiman from THE VISITOR is here (which is, believe me, the only reason I bought this piece of crap), and he's gorgeous...not to mention not offensive or stereo-typical. The man has an amazing body, which doesn't show in THE VISITOR.I gave this review one star, but that's only because there's no way to give it half a star."
3,Not especially fabulous or original,"I give the film-maker credit for taking on gay issues in a predominatly African-American (and Latino) setting, and doing so with some grace and style.Otherwise, this story has been told repeatedly with the same characters, and this take isn't particularly fresh or interesting. The story and characters are completely forgettable, although some are charming and funny for portions of the film. Add to that this film is poorly-named and has scarcely any more to do with a ski trip than any other reason for a group of friends to sit around a table, squabbling, pointing out each others' faults, and having great revelations about themselves.This is okay and probably worth a rental, but it's a long way from the top of the list."
2,Haaz Sleiman shines,"I rented this movie from netflix after researching Haaz Sleiman on the internet. I saw the trailer and saw that Haaz Sleiman appeared shirtless and I thought this movie was worth seeing. I fast forwarded through the entire movie unless Haaz Sleiman was in the scene. When he was asked to go on the Ski Trip, I hollered 'Don't go!'. He is a real hunk among the effeminate portrayals of homosexuality."
5,Great Gloves with a built in snot wiper!,These are quality made gloves. DU has certainly improved the quality of their products in recent years. I used to liken their stuff to pretty much Wal-Mart type quality but these gloves are nice.The insert for the handwarmer is handy on the real real cold days.They are durably made and mine have no rips or tears even though I used them hard through hunting and ice fishing so far.The soft snot wiper is handy and worth a chuckle from your friends.I used to cut a swatch from an old tshirt and pin it to my jacket to wipe snot and that worked quite well but the gloves do the trick too.A fine glove for moderate cold or even extreme cold if you use the handwarmer.
1,Worst sinks I have ever owned,"I chose two of these sinks for our new home in 2009. After about 18 months they both began to get hair line cracks. By the time they were 30 months old they had developed hundreds of hairline cracks and one of the sinks cracked all of the way through. This is a difficult situation as we had our Granite top cut to fit the sinks and it is hard to find others that will fit the same size hole. I contacted the company where they were purchased and they contacted the distributor who said they would not replace even though they were under a five year warranty. Bad company and terrible customer support. Don't buy their products, they say they are a premium sink but they just look good, bad quality."
5,you'll find it cheaper under its other entries on this site,"It is now on ""The Originals"" for much cheaper (Franck: Sonata for Violin & Piano; Brahms: Trio for Violin, Horn & Piano), and you can also find the initial CD reissue, from 1984, at a cheaper price (Franck/Brahms: Violin Sonata/Horn Trio). For the interpretive merits of these recordings (especially of the Franck Sonata) I also refer you to my review under the latter entry."
4,quick grips are great,"I have about 15 quick grip clamps for woodworking that have stood to years of ABUSE, so when one was made for welding I had to try it. This clamp works great. The large grip/clamp handle is easy to use while wearing welding gloves and can be opened or closed with one hand by using the release bar. The total open width is 6 1/4 in. and closes completely with 15 pulls of the handle.The metal clamp faces grooved for better griping and are splatter resistant. Much better then a ""C"" clamp."
1,Mission grandfather clock drawings,"Drawings were Ok with some of the measurements wrong, instructions on assembly were very poor and inaccurate with no info on the jigs that were requiredI have ordered drawings before online and must say these are the poorest"
4,its alright,wasn't sure what to expect but not too shabby to say the least. he sounds like his father which isn't a bad thing at all.
2,Poor Sound Quality...,"Perhaps it was intended, however, I didn't enjoy the sound quality of this recording. It doesn't sound professional. Secondly, not being terribly familiar with the singer's creative whimsiness...I was surprized by the funny lyrics and had a hard time relating to the songs because the words were rather ridiculous. I bought this because of the Old Navy commercial. I had nothing else to go on. I have listened to it a couple of times thinking that it would rub off on me. I still like the Old Navy song, however, I wouldn't recommend the album. I like her voice...she needs better songs to sing and better sound quality in order for me to buy anything more."
1,Once in a while you get a bad one.,"This was a very hyped CD and for me with my middle of the road taste, found it to be the worse CD I have purchased, in addition to Blue Raincoat by Jennifer Warrens. After The Hunter with Jennifer Warnnes came out, Jennifer could have sold me an Edsel. What is her game plan? On Michaelson's album girls and boys I did like ""The Way I Am"". I do have a machine that will let me splice tracks together, so maybe I can salvage one song from the miserable album."
4,ok if you like the 1234 song,"I really like the 1234 song, so the rest of the cd is ok, but don't expect much variety. If you could buy just the single, I would recommend that..."
1,Love the Music - if only I could hear it,The CD I received is damaged. It skips every two seconds and you can't hear a full voice flow. Very disappointed!
4,Two Thumbs Up,"So happy that I purchased this CD. Truly enjoy listening to it. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. Definitely deserves a ""two thumbs up""!!!!"
5,Melodic and wonderful,"Ingrid Michaelson's cd is great, and I am surprised it isnt bigger than it is. Fans of Feist and Norah Jones will love this cd. She has a wonderful voice, and good original lyrics."
4,A Safe Nellie McKay,"Pretty cool, a lil' quirky...kinda like a Nellie McKay for conservatives. Not intended to be a put down, the music is really good, singing too. A bit generic in that she stays safely in the box, exploring the edges, but not daring to step out of the box ala McKay..."
2,"good voice, bad songs","i have had really good luck with finding music thru amazon until i bought ingrid michaelson's ""girls and boys"". i was excited on the first track to hear such a quality voice, but the songs and the lyrics throughout are, well, just stupid. my best description would be to say that each song is comprised of the random thoughts of a woman as if she was day dreaming. every song is whimsical and disjointed, without depth or thought or meaning. quite a few songs have some type of instrumentation designed to sound like some kind or background noise,(purpose unknown) which is very irritating and disturbing to listen to. i don't know what the artist was trying to do here, but i am glad i bought this one used and at a cheap price. do yourself a favor and pass this one by."
4,Great Album,"Purchased this after hearing a song from it played on my favorite radio station (wxpn) and the album doesn't disappoint. It's more than a wee bit Regina Spektor-esque, so perhaps lacks some stylistic originality, but it's still enjoyable (especially if you like Regina'sBegin to Hope). Ingrid does list Regina as an influence on her mySpace page, so I guess the similarities should come as no surprise. Really enjoying it, though, from start to finish."
2,Guitar too loud,"Her voice is sweet, but too quiet for the loud guitar behind her. I find it distracting and cluttery."
5,Falling in love with Ingrid Michaelson,"This is an excellent cd. I can listen to the whole thing over and over again. Favorite songs include; ""Die Alone,"" ""Breakable,"" ""The Way I Am"" and ""Corner of Your Heart."""
3,Girls and Boys = sugar+spice = Ingrid Michaelson,"Fun, lighthearted music. Sure to put you in a good mood. Refreshing like a glass of pure cold water; the ""girl"" Ingrid has the ""voice"" to carry such simple lyrics to a ""unique"" level. Highly recommend for any age of ""Girls and Boys"". I got this thru ""pepsi points"" this CD is about as ""American and wholsome as Pepsi. Thanks to Pepsi and Amazon for this is one I might have missed."
4,I love this artist!,"I had not had any exposure to Ingrid, but after seeing her on a television show, I decided to listen to snips of this album, and then I bought it. I love so many of the songs on this CD. She has a very sweet, pure sound that I find appealing."
1,Poorly written book,"I had no choice but to purchase this book for my class. The book is poorly written, making the material unnecessarily complex. There are sections that ramble, as example, the first chapter where the author writes about the various laws. I would not recommend."
2,Only good if you can read it.,"I can't image how a well know publisher like South-Western could mess up this badly. I have perfect 20/20 vision and have read countless textbooks in my life - that said, I can tell you that this is an exceptionally difficult book to keep focused on - literally! My eyes begin to strain and ache after 5 min. of reading, primarily because of the poorly chosen typestyle and typesize.There may be valuable information in here - but I'm going to find it elsewhere."
3,"LOVE the lotion, dislike the smell","Usually a fan of Cocoa Mango lotion, I thought I'd try a new scent. This lotion (brand and type) is the best lotion I've used, it is thick, soothing, it lasts all day to make your skin feel soft, and can be used on face/body. But this scent is not something I am fond of... Too floral and I generally dislike it. I will keep with this brand for their shea butter lotions, but return to my usual fragrance choice."
1,Save your money,"I can't believe how highly unbelievable and TORTUROUSLY dorky the male character is. If just one more time I had to read his ""I, I, I"" utterance before every communication with the female character, ""I,I,I"" was going to scream!"
3,Great conducting; Lousy recording,"Frankly, I was aghast after the highly promising opening to hear the sound in quieter passages anything but Decca quality (even Naxos could have done better I am sure). The beautiful melody for 16-part divided strings immediately after the opening fanfare sounds like broken shards of glass strewing all over the place. And that pretty much holds true for the duration of the piece -- very dry, air-less sounding strings.I met Mo. Solti in San Francisco a few weeks before he died, so I am going to keep this CD for sentimental reasons. But Decca engineers ought to be ashamed for botching up this important gig."
4,Pretty good but not great,"This is a pretty good stapler for light use but I would not use it in a production shop. It's works well but misfires A LOT. About 15% to 20% of the time it dry-fires and doesn't place a staple. It's as if it shoots one but doesn't advance the stack. One fellow suggested I oil the staples before I put them in the gun. Yeah, I want to attach silk or brocade with oiled staples! I just shoot it again, sometimes 2 or 3 more times and it goes. Staple length doesn't seem to matter. It's an annoyance but a small one.And the others are right. You can't buy staples anywhere for it. I have been to dozens of places in Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, and Vancouver and no soap - rather no staples. I got them from Amazon but had to wait of course. A few upholsterers had them but not for sale.I'll keep it and use it, and even like it but Amazon better keep stock in staples. Also be aware - *THERE IS NO SAFETY* on this unit! You squeeze the trigger, it fires!"
5,Porter Cable Air Upholstery Stapler,My Porter Cable Stapler has been a God send. It really makes my small and bigupholstery jobs easy. I don't know why I didn't buy one years ago. If you do any upholstery at all I would highly recomend this one to you.
4,"Simple, reliable tool","I've only used this for one big job so far. It wasn't exactly its intended use, but worked like a charm throwing stainless steel staples to tack thin-gauge aluminum in place. I had one or two jams that were because of hiccups in the material I was using rather than the tool. Cleaning the jams was easy.It's probably standard with this sort of tool, but I wasn't originally aware that there's no safety on it (like there is for brad nailers and larger staplers). However, the staples loose momentum really quickly, so doesn't really seem all that dangerous. Just wear your glasses.I see lots of reviews complaining about the lack of hard case. The tool seems too small and light to bother with a case. I just put mine in a drawer."
5,works perfectly,"works perfectly. my only concern is the lack of a safety, although this is also a benefit because it lets you get staples into tighter spots that otherwise couldn't be reached with a different gun."
4,Porter-cable us58 1/4-inch to 5/8 - inch 22 gauge c- crown uphoilster gun,I purchased the gun with some reservation as to weather it would perform correctly. I am very impress with the capabilities of the upholstery gun. My product is far superior and very professional when using the upholstery gunPlava Plumb
5,Great Stapler,"I used the US58 to hang fabric in my HT room and had no problems with it. I had a hard time finding staples at my local HD, but Menards had them and cheaper than amazon. I have run about 10,000 staples through the gun with no problems. It did not come with a plastic case, not a big deal to me."
1,Junk!,"I own a upholstery factory and usually use BEa and rainco staplers. I thought I would give this a try because of cost...you get what you pay for! It worked great for 3 months, then the piston housing broke! Not a crack, it broke in half. Not fixable. I guess if you are a casual user, it is probably OK. If you need durability, do not buy this stapler!"
4,"Good, solid tool should last a long time. Cost, eh...","This is a very good, pretty much industry-standard upholstery stapler. Simple, solid, light, very easy to use. Does the job well. My only beef is the price. It definitely does what it needs to do, but it is very old technology for a tool... Just needs to be about $15-20 less and it's 5 stars, in my opinion."
3,Don't forget to order staples.,I was disappointed that it did not include any staples to test out the operation. Not a single staple.
5,picture framer,"We thought this worked well, just wished that the staple we had bought to go with it were a little stronger to make picture frames, but they both worked great."
4,It will probably be a good tool,"I hope you're not in a hurry for this item. Even though it is in stock, and is an Amazon item (not a third party vendor), it may take a month, or more, for them to get around to sticking a stamp on it and mailing it out."
4,Happy this was included in a combo package,"I received this stapler as part of a Porter-Cable package with multiple other air nailers and and pancake compressor. I didn't think I'd ever need an air stapler. However, I just installed some electric floor heating cables in a new bathroom. I needed someway to attach the heating mats to the hardy board I used for a subfloor before laying the tile. My regular hand stapler didn't work at all, but this air stapler worked great and made the job much quicker and easier. I probably won't ever use it for upholstery, but it already paid for itself."
3,Works well when it works well....,"As another reviewer mentioned, there are a lot of misfires. Doesn't compare favorably with my set of Bostitch nailers. I think this machine just needs constant oiling and cleaning, but it's a pain and the instructions are insufficient. I first used this to reupholster an antique settee/rocker set and it worked very well with a few misfires (5-10%). Now I'm using it to make a set of 5 window cornices and the misfires have been getting out of control. Honestly not sure if I can recommend this, but I was very pleased with it initially. I'm currently researching to see if I can perform other types of maintenance to reduce misfires. Another reviewer said it wasn't for casual use...maybe it's true. I'm on my 1000th or so staple and it's rough going now."
4,Hard case missing!,"Love the gun but when there is the word ""KIT"" there should be a nice case to go with it. I don't use it all the time & would have liked to see a case."
2,"A year later, not so excited about this purchase","I purchased this item 12 months ago, but did not write a review at the time. I decided I did not want to review it right away, but to see how it actually performed over time. I'm sorry to say that I am now in the market to purchase a different tool due to the ever increasing misfires with this gun. At first, it worked like a dream and I thought I had really scored over the others in my upholstery workshop who purchased much more expensive units. In spite of diligent cleaning and oiling, however, the misfire rate has increased to an unmanageable degree. It is not unusual for me to have twenty misfires to every delivered staple. Sure makes the work slowgoing. Perhaps I am missing something, but with sparse manufacturer instructions, I expect I will remain in the dark.-Disappointed in Illinois."
5,Good Move!!!,"I often wonder why some titles are "" Sat on "" when they could be sold to the public. Well i am glad for those who missed this the first time around that they have let it back out to the public. I love!!! this CD. It is great and in my view the best so far of the ER releases. Mode for joe is My favorite cut (Dare i say of all time) As a reward for reading this review, i will hip you to a secret. It's called "" Darn that Dream "" It's on "" Real Time Records "" It is Art Peppers Last gig, and i think he knew it. His version of Mode for Joe and Green Dolphin Street are off the planet. They rival and depend on my mood even top this CD. They are 1 and 2 in my collection and often trade places. If you even half way like the Eatern Rebellion CD then PLEASE!! Get ""Darn That Dream"" before it (If not already) Goes out of print."
2,Quality dropped over the last couple years,"Now that all Vise Grips are made 100% in China, their quality and feel is quite lacking. I have many ""made in USA"" Vise Grips from years ago that still feel and work great. It is a shame to see such wonderful tools go leave for cheaper low quality labor and materials. I am currently looking for USA made alternatives. Irwin made Vise Grips are no longer what they were when made here in the USA. Shocking that China still can't make good tools btw."
3,Now made in China,"At some time in the last 2-3 years, Irwin has started manufacturing the Vice Grips in China. Before then, they were made in the USA."
2,just not the same,they are from china and it shows !!! the steal is cheap the craftsman ship is poor and they are just not the same . junk junk junk
3,"Dry read, but great info","Not a bad book, although at times it was quite tendious to read. It gives a basic overview of Soviet involvement in major world coflicts (Spanish civil War, WW2, Vietanam, Arab-Israeli wars etc). It is quite heavy on militaristic elements, which would be interesting to anyone interested in how wars are fought and funded. The historical backgrounds of the wars are briefly discussed, as fell as the fallout created by conflict. Interesting chapter about Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, which gives a detailed look into the geo-political reasons for the invasion. All in all, not a bad book, but lacking in historical depth."
2,Classic but its over,"Yes it is a classic, but in all actuality it wasn't as good as I remembered. Played twice got bored. Don't waste your money."
4,Great taste and convenience.,"Horizon Organic Milk is a great product, the taste is very good. The solo package is convenience to bring it with me for the kids. I would give it a 5 stars. I gave 4 stars because Amazon sells them in a high price. I just went to the local Target store and the items (Regular and Chocolate flavor) are on sale right now thru 6/16/2008 for $0.50 each. 3 packs package is 2 for $5.00."
2,A poor choice if you care about organic integrity,"Organic milk is a good choice for green lunchboxes. However, if you're concerned with sustainability and the humane treatment of animals, please be aware that Horizon has been cited for factory farming practices that violate organic standards. Horizon farms 4,000 cows (very large) and has refused to cooperate with the Cornucopia Institute's review of organic dairies; the company is considered ""ethically deficient."" (If you're interested in learning more about organic dairy farming, definitely check out the Cornucopia Institute's commentary and dairy reviews.)Personally I've started buying Organic Valley's milk boxes instead of Horizon's. Organic Valley is rated 4/Excellent in the CI review. Here's their 1% milk box. It also comes in strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla.Organic Valley Organic 1% Lowfat Single Serve Milk, 8-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 24)"
4,Great Product But Expiration Date at Amazon is Way Too Soon!,"I was happy to see that Amazon offered Horizon products. However, the expiration date on my purchase was ""right around the corner"" and I had to throw out some of the drink boxes. I would appreciate if Amazon could list expiration date on the site. Then I would gladly purchase here again."
5,"Horizon Organic Reduced Fat Milk, 8-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 18)",I was delighted when Horizon came out with Aseptic carton milk. We live in an area that is subjected to frequent thunder and ice storms. We lose power regularly. The shelf life of aseptic carton milk is about 4 to 6 months...so keep a couple cartons on hand and rotate them as needed. The flavor is excellent. It's hard to make pancakes and eggs without power but at least a bowl of cereal is doable with this product.
5,One of the best products out there,"Most regularly packaged milks are NOT UHT treated-- that is ""Ultra-High Temperature."" Much like Pasteurization or autoclaving, this sterilization treatment significantly extends the life of the product by increasing the time it takes for bacteria to grow in significant quantities in the milk (the bacteria is what makes a warm bottle of milk ""go bad""). The difference is these do not require refrigeration to prevent spoilage. These are bottled to be portable and durable, not just consumption. We use them for our daughter's lunches, trips, and general snacks.It is true at $1.22 per bottle, the cost is ~20 cents higher than you can get at other locations--i.e., the cases are ~$16 at Costco. Still, for those of us that live in remote/rural locations-- it's a really good deal for doorstep delivery."
4,Twice the price of Horizon Organic's fresh milk,"After the discount, these are twice the price of regularly packaged organic milk which is twice the reported all time high price of fresh milk. I mainly use liquid milk for ice cream and I use cheaper powdered milk for baking. Although I am paying double, there is no waste and no accompanying stress and also no frequent trips to the market to keep this stuff on hand.In New York City, fresh organic milk is a whopping $8 per gallon. The national average for regular milk is now at an all time high of $3.80."
2,"They send me almost expired one, I can taste they are not fresh",Amazon send me almost expired cartons of these milk and they taste old. I usually like the tastes of this low fat milk but this time I can taste it is not fresh. I was subscribing them so i just canceled. They never tell you experation date of your milk cartons. So be ware.
2,Not exactly what I expected,"I had never had organic milk before I bought this product. The taste is very different from ""regular"" milk, and my kids just don't like it. I find myself stuck drinking them all, and I'm not all that thrilled with the taste myself. Also, the straws are very annoying, and don't suck up the milk well unless they are positioned just so. To top it off, the box they came in said to keep under 80 degrees. I had these delivered in the heat of summer and I questioned whether they had been kept below that during transport. Maybe that's why it doesn't taste that great - but I haven't gotten sick on it so its probably fine."
2,Short shelf life,This only has a shelf life of a few months. Why does the Chocolate milk have a shelf life of a year and the reduced fat milk (non chocolate) have a shelf life of 4 month.It seems quite a few people are buying it for backup usage and there are only a few months to use it.
2,Shelf Life???,"I have not tasted this product, so sorry no help there. However, I do not recommend ordering for long term use or emergency preparedness. I ordered at the beginning of Sept and my product has an expiration of mid Nov. We might be using this pricey milk around the house just to avoid waste."
5,Organic Milk,This is great milk at a great price! It's easy to take along with us when we are on the go with our 16 month old son. And it doesn't need to be refrigerated which makes it even more convenient.
2,they add SUGAR to the milk,"I agree with most reviewers; convenient, tastes funny and quite expensive. It is difficult for me to get to the store and I used this milk mostly in cooking or for hot chocolate in spite of the cost and DIFFERENT taste. When I realized that HORIZON added sugar to the milk and read about the numerous USDA complaints I stopped buying this milk. I now use powdered organic goat milk and another brand of milk cartons that does not add SUGAR."
3,"convenient, but at what price?","Loved how nice this was to throw into the diaper bag, but have read a lot lately about how the ""ultra-pasturized"" milk is really bad for us. The process that makes it shelf stable makes the proteins (casein) unrecognizable to our bodies... We have decided convenience is not worth the risk to our family."
5,yum,"This is milk just the way I like it: tasty, pratical, and storable! I personally love that slight caramel taste that milk takes during the UHT process (ultra-high temperature pasteurization). It is what some people call a ""cooked"" flavor. Some don't like it; I grew up on it (back in Europe), so I love it! It tastes creamier and a bit sweeter. :)"
4,"Great for on the go, road trips","Once my baby could sip with a straw, we've been getting this for him (he's now 3). It makes getting out the door a lot more convenient. Also, the milk does not spoil as you don't need to refrigerate until it's opened. Relatively more nutritious alternative to juice. ""Subscribe & save"" this and you'll save some money too. I wish it was more efficiently packaged (hence the 4-stars); the bubble packaging is much too wasteful."
5,Best for on the go~,"I use this for my son's lunch pack. Of course you could buy school milk but my son doesn't like the taste of his school milk and I don't like the fact that it's not organic. I rather buy other brands of organic milk but Horizon aseptic carton milk are what is carried in our local Whole Foods. I just bought two packs getting ready for the school year and noticed huge price difference. It's almost $9~10 cheaper at Whole Foods. So ladies if you have a Whole Foods nears you, you know what to do. The milk tastes great and I actually put it in the freezer for a couple of hours (it's not frozen all the way) before I pack my son's lunch so it's nice and cool when he drinks it at school."
4,plain but tastes like melted milkshake!,"plain white milk is always my first choice compared to flavored milk, out of health concerns. one pack each day from the fridge goes into my daughter's lunch box for school. her comment is: it doesn't taste like regular plain milk, but like melted milkshake! a little pricy though compared to regular milk.. i bought two boxes when amazon had promotions and now it's time to refill my inventory. waiting for good deals again..."
3,"Convenient, but strange chemical taste","Very convenient, grab-and-go, no refrigeration required before opening. However, these little containers of milk do have a strange chemical taste. In my opinion, this is likely due to the packaging container."
4,Super Convenient & Healthy,"These are sturdy, convenient little milk boxes. You don't have to refrigerate them until you want to get them cold. Awesome.I usually order one of these big packs before we go camping, because I HATE to be without cold milk at breakfast. I just stick them in the cooler with everything else. I've never had a problem with them bursting or getting crunched. They travel far better than traditional little cartons of milk.I normally go for Organic Valley milk, because they're known for REALLY high standards in how they treat their cows, but Horizon is a decent backup brand for people who care about that sort of thing."
5,Excellent for beginners..,My son's pre-school uses these books and worksheets to teach reading. The books are awesome! My 4 year old is reading so well and has moved on to the second series. I recommend these books to anyone with a pre-schooler eager to begin reading..
5,Absolutely the best I've found,"I've been using these books (sets 1-4) to teach my daughter how to read for about a year now (she's 3). We progressed through set one and are now into set two, and the quality so far has been excellent. I've looked at many other beginning reader sets, and without exception they have all made use of too many sight words and other confusing parts of our language, which ends up making reading into a much more taxing chore than it needs to be. With these books, sight words and pronunciation exceptions are kept to a bare minimum, which allows the child to focus on learning the sounds associated with the letters. Later, when the basic framework of phonics has been mastered, the exceptions can be added in without undue confusion. I really like these books, and highly recommend them."
4,Intriguing Early Example of Stream of Consciousness,"Written in 1901, twenty years before James Joyce's ""Ulysses"", this is a very early example of the literary stream of consciousness technique. Indeed, Joyce acknowledged his debt to this story. It is an indictment of Austrian militarism, as the book explores the mind of the young Viennese officer, Lieutenant Gustl. Gustl ruminates upon whether to take his own life, after suffering what he believes to be an insult to his honor, while retrieving his coat at the cloakroom after a concert he is attending. His thoughts flit from one thing to another, and the reader is given a look at the shallow and arrogant nature of Austrian society during the fin de siecle period."
3,not quite sure what to make of this...,"i picked this one up (actually i have version #1) because i was looking forward to the remixes. the album that this song comes from ""love and the russian winter"" was a bit too mellow with one ballad after another. i was excited to hear this song (a very nice one) spiced up.not what i got. my cd has 1 remix in common with this one - ""ignorant's remix"" and another one that i'd bet is pretty close ""mousse t super funk edit"" (who can tell me the difference between a mix and an edit - i've been trying to figure this out for years).the remixes are different than the original, but in an electronica, mellow, lounge sort of way. so, if you're into a nice set of vocals playing in the background, this will definitely hit the spot. if you're looking for wild, energetic dancing - go back to their 2nd album."
3,"Pretty good, with minor editing and proofreading errors","It was a pretty good overview of fire investigations. I was bothered by proofreading errors.Readers of chapter 3 (p34) strained to understand how a fire could creep along a low incline rather than flame upward. They were told this was due to the ""...so-called colander effect, whereby jets stick to walls."" If they were imagining some sort of sieve, they were mislead. The effect which causes fluid jets to bend around gentle curves is properly called the Coanda effect, named after a hydraulics theoretician.A few other minor errors like a ""Kray-2"" supercomputer mar the account, which is otherwise good reading.I was happy to see a chapter discounting the widespread belief that crowds of people tend to panic in fires."
5,"Oh, it's a very useful book!","I'm from Beijing, China. I've read this book, and find it is indeed very useful and helpful!"
3,Conjure Wife rates 5 stars,"Conjure Wife was a riveting story of the dire consequences that follow when a very rational professor at a small college finds his wife is practicing witchcraft. The pace is fast and the characters are well drawn. It held my attention to the end, and I can understand why it's described as a classic.The second novel, Our Lady of Darkness, starts well but the premise behind the paramentals seemed silly, and by the middle of the book it had gotten almost boring. The climax was perhaps even more idiotic than the 'paramentals'. Overall this modern spin on the supernatural just seemed too half-baked."
3,Both stories lost me in the latter parts,"I don't know, I was really excited to read both Conjure Wife and Our Lady of Darkness, but after finishing both stories I felt that there was something missing from them. Mr. Leiber definitely knows how to create scenes of ""atmosphere"" and ""dread."" And I really enjoyed his descriptions of witchcraft and the paramentals. Maybe it was the slighly abrupt endings, the quick way of wrapping things up that put me off...All I can say is that i've read scarier books."
1,Starforced again!,"Yet another game using the invasive Starforce drivers! My friend installed this on his computer and the reason HE is not typing this now is Starforce pretty much baked his hard drive. The drivers bar you from using legitimate functions of your computer, playing the game half the time, and install drivers with Administrator-level access; making them a VERY popular target for viruses and the like."
1,TERRIBLE!!,I thought this would be fun to play while I was deployed. This game is terrible and seems to be on a completely different type action program than the rest of the Prince of Persia games...terrible!
4,Clear thinking by an author known for pursuing truth,"This is a brief, clearly written examination of problems arising from the ideological and philosophical foundations of Darwinism. I'd recommend this highly for teenagers and older readers also."
1,Garbage.,"Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them. It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's. Not any more. Inform yourselves, people. I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"
1,Call It ID But It's Still Old-Time-Religion,"Every day science keeps advancing, but Johnson and his followers are stuck in 18th century philosophizing. Johnson's arguments in this latest book are a repeat of that discredited notion that God must certainly exist in the gaps that science has not yet illuminated. The recent completion of the Human Genome Project and the mapping of genetic material from a host of living organisms supports to the evolutionary paradigm and crushes Johnson's pseudo-philosophical arguments. Johnson attempts to appeal to the masses who need to have a God somehow involved in nature. What Johnson does not do, and cannot do, is overturn sound science with clever rhetoric and his book fails miserably in overturning evolution or supporting his fundamentalist creationist agenda. If you want to read a lawyers attempt at science with little knowledge of the scientific facts or reality, this is the book for you!"
1,Misses the point entirely.,"Like the existence of nuclear weaponry, our chief difficulty with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution is unfortunately NOT that it isn't true, but rather that it IS true, and we don't know how to deal ethically with its consequences. These include our new ability to influence--and even sidestep--evolutionary change on a scale never before imagined.Pulling the blanket up over our eyes and pretending that the problem isn't there is not the answer. Sadly, the chief message of this misguided book is that it's okay for us to ignore the truth that is barrelling down upon us like a runaway freight train.God help us all. We're going to need it."
1,a lawyer explains science,"As a lawyer, Johnson knows that during trials a expert witness is queried to what his expert qualifications are. I want to know what Johnson's expert qualifications are in Bioliogy to argue for creationism. What meaursurable testable evidence does he have?"
4,Disappointed that the book did not contain the quotes with the photos,"I recalled that Interview Magazine published photos from this book with short Andy Warholesque quotes. i thought the book would have all the little quotes in it, but it did not. Beautiful photos from Avedon, Weber and Testino."
3,The parts do not equal the whole,"I love Genesis. This is a decent enough solo project. I'm not thrilled by the entire set list, but there are some nice instrumental passages. However I do feel that overall the depth of the sound is not full enough. Even when there are guitars, keyboards, bass and drums trying to impart something dramatic it just lacks impact. Even the singer has a very middle-of-the road vocals that seem to plague a lot of Genesis solo efforts, (obviously not including Phil and Peter's solo work.) Not a must have, but something for the curious."
4,"Good, but too similar to Steve Hackett's eighties solo stuff","Originally released in 1980, ""Smallcreep's Day"" by Genesis' guitarrist Mike Rutherford sounds a LOT like the solo material his former Genesis colleague, Steve Hackett, was releasing at the time. It has a couple of great moments that almost warrant having the album. But overall, it is not as solid as ""Duke"" by Genesis (which was released at about the same time) or even less like Hackett's solo work, which -along with Gabriel's and Collins'- was among the best music to get spun off of the legendary prog band."
5,My real review on this fine debut,"The other review I wrote here doesn't count according to what's on album 'cos I wrote it before I got the album. The other one is just extra. Not bad for a first try, even with some other guy singing. Reminds me of the late '70s Genesis. Cut at ABBA's Polar Studios where ""Duke"" was cut before, not long after. Originally released in the U.S. and Canada in 1980 by the now-defunct Passport/Jem Records. I have the record. A must have for loyal Genesis fans like moi."
3,First solo album has some rewards for Genesis fans,"Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford's first album is nothing special, but has some pleasures for Genesis fans. One side of the album is a ""concept"" piece about a factory drone who ventures off to discover what exactly it is they are producing. The suite includes the two best songs on the album, the arpeggiated ""Cats and Rats (in This Neighborhood)"" and the lively instrumental ""Out into the Daylight"". The other half of the album is merely okay; all of the songs would be outtakes on any Genesis album. Anthony Phillips, the original Genesis lead guitarist, plays keyboards here. I don't care much for singer Noel McCalla's voice--he sounds too much like the hired hand he is.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
4,GREAT SOLO GENESIS CD,This is arguably the best Genesis solo album. Mike does a great long composition in the spirit of Supper's Ready where he displays his fabulous guitar work (guitar and bass). Great melodic music that Danjob continues to ignore. You should not ignore this great work.
1,nothing but troubles,This is my second PC roofer. I wore out the first one in about a year. Home Depot lost it while rebuilding it. To their credit they gave me a new one. That was 8 months ago. the second gun jammed more than the first and gave up the ghost 2 weeks ago. I am a carpenter by trade and only do 150 or so squares a year- not abuse by any means. by the way I'm ordering a Hitachi this week
3,"Alright for ""Do It Yourselfer's""",The RN175 was the first (2)roofing nailers I bought. It's not bad for a low volumn of work but is simply not made for the long haul. After approximately 300 square each I began to have problems with o-rings. I also had to replace drivers in both guns at a cost of about $100 each. If you're wanting to roof your own house it's not a bad buy. If you're a contractor buy a Hitachi. There's no comparison.
2,Jambs Frequently,"I'm using 1"" nails and the unit jambs 10% of the time. Very frustrating. Instructions state to use PC nails (hard to find). Oil, clean, tightens screws or replace worn driver. I've done 1.5 roofs with this, so it's not worn out. I have three other PC nailers that work well. Be careful buying this one. Not sure if the RN175A (mine's not an A mode) will help. Apparently the advance mechanism has been improved. Also, I agree with another reviewer: you must bump nail or you'll get doubles (and jambs) just using the trigger."
1,junk,I RECENTLY BOUGHT TWO OF THEM AND THEY JUST DIDNT DO TO GOOD.ONE OF THEM TORE UP. THE OTHER DONT SHOOT THE NAIL UP ALL THE WAY.
4,Can't beat it for the price,"I have used this gun for three months now, and have had only two jams. Both were easy to clear in a couple of seconds with a flat blade screwdriver and could probably be attributed to a bent coillating wire on the nail coil. This is my third Porter-Cable nailer, and I have had great luck with all three. They are lightweight and dependable, but only time will tell if they hold up as well as my Bostich nailers. I have several other Porter-Cable power tools, and have had no problems with any of them. My cordless drill still works after 15 years (with the original batteries)and countless drops off the ladder."
4,"Not Bad, Not Great!","I purchased the RN175 roofing nailer because of the reputation of Porter Cable. I have used the Hitachi nailer before but didn't want to spend the extra money. I used grip-tight nails and found the gun jammed more often than not. However, I changed the brand of nails (called Continental Materials) and never had any problems. It is able to handle roof after roof. Not a bad nailer for the price but if you want to spend more, you could get a more dependable gun like a Hitachi."
1,RN175 is junk,"I got my RN175 from the home depot for one penny when I bought a skid of nails and I think I overpaid for this tool. It does not hold up to industrial standards. Also, when I took it in for repair the parts were more expensive than comparable parts of other brands. I have found that you end up paying in the long run with higher repair costs, more downtime, and poor reliability. I should have stuck with Hitachi."
5,The basic Wagner Opera.,"I reccomend it, specially when your're a little bit festive. Is the masterpiece of Richard Wagner, indeed."
3,I would any day go for...,"I find it diffecult to see what this recording should have to offer when compared to Kempe with Grummer, Frantz and the Berlin Philharmonic (excellent mono sound) or Karajan's live Bayreuth account with Schwarzkopf (the best Eve in History), Hopf, Kunz et al or, indeed, Knappertsbusch with HIS Vienna band.The singers are by all account inadequate and Solti conducts - as usual - as if he was searching for an orgasm in every bar (to quote Walter Legge."
3,Inappropriate Read,"I bought the book thinking it would be another Tales from the City type adventure.Instead it was about a woman that focused on her weight for at least the first 10 pages, then said that it isn't a book that focuses about weight.I am only on the 4th chapter and I can just tell from her whining about her relationship with Geoff, the married guy that he is going to dump her eventually, thus dragging me down for the next dozen or so chapters until he does so.(...) I don't like being strung along for too long in such a book and I grow tired of him constantly reminding her that there isn't that much between them except sex.It is a good book but obviously it shows a clear case of women in love can't think clearly when it comes to dating married men."
1,Kritters Ramblings,"Short and simple - did not like this one. Way too much language, sex and the like. I was just darn annoyed that a married woman honestly started an affair with another guy.If you are a fan of the vulgar, this one is for you."
1,CAN YOU SAY CRAP!,"""Inappropriate Men"" by Stacey Ballis has to be one the worst books that I ever read. Sidney Stein is a woman who cheat on her husband with a married man(does seem to bother much) writes poetry about it (Which the writer's puts into the book) I don't know how its ends because I couldn't see myself finishing it. Red Dress Ink really allowed a bad book to be on the market."
2,What I expect from Red Dress Ink,This book was not interesting; I couldn't even finish it. The main character was so annoying!I actually didn't look at the publisher or I wouldn't have ordered it. I have found that most red dress ink books are not the most well-written books and will look at the publisher from now on...
1,Boring with No Plot,"It seems as though the entirety of the book is focused on a plot line that is going nowhere, ie; Sidney's affair with married man Geoff. Also I found myself skimming through her excruciating painful poetry and love letters to said married man. If one could convey watching a train wreck through words Stacey Ballis has done well. Skip this book!! Unless you want to be bored to tears."
4,A little different,"This book was a little different from the other chick lit out there. It deals with infidelity, which may be too ""heavy"" for other books, but is dealt with well here. The character inserts poetry and speaks to the reader, two unusual devices. There's no doubt Ballis is intelligent, and some of her observations and lines are so sharp and witty, I wish I'd thought of them myself."
1,What were the publishers thinking?,"I can't believe this book actually got published. It is one of the worst books I've ever read. Even if you skip all the poetry (which I did), it still isn't entertaining. In fact, I found the book somewhat depressing. There is nothing engaging about the character or the writing. On the back of the book it claims to be laugh out loud funny - I didn't laugh once. The book isn't remotely amusing. This story is supposed to be about a confident, plus-size woman. If she's so confident, why does she put up with such a crappy quasi-relationship? Do yourself a favor, do not waste your time and money with this book."
1,oh please.,"I'm normally a huge fan of the Red Dress Ink books, but I must say that they had it wrong this time.I picked up the book because of the description of an ""unapologetically"" plus-sized heroine. That peaked my interest and got me to purchase the book, but for everything else I can't comment too much, because I never read that far.The main thing that I found was that the story seemed very jumpy and it was hard to get into. Then, the heroine, wrote these HUGE poetic jumbles that I found myself skipping over, just to get back to the story. It seemed to me like they were just inserted to take up space, because they didn't add to the story any.Anyway. I didn't like this book. I abandoned it rather quickly."
3,Starts great...then eeeehh,This book is very entertaining in the beginning. I really enjoyed the story. I think the character's poetic writings in her own unique language scattered throughout the book are a little much and I began to skip over them as I read on. This book is really interesting. At times you feel disppointed with the character for displaying the behavior that she does. But that's part of the story of the heart wants what it wants. The book's written very well though and I did look into other writings by this author. It's a good book overall.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book along with TopScore CD. I looked at the reviews and thought this is a wonderful book for preparation for DAT. Well, it is not even close. The content in this book is not enough for the real DAT, especially the biology part. Fortunately I found this out before the test and I had to postpone the test one week later than I scheduled. I bought the Schaum's Outline for Biology and Chemsitry (two review books) and studied those two books intensively in the last week before DAT. Here is my scores: Bio 22, Gen 28, Org 25. I do think the Schaum's Outlines saved me from a big failure. I am glad that I didn't trust this book. And Schaum's books are amazingly inexpensive. That can save you about 20 bucks. And I am not selling my used Kaplan book here because I don't think it's that useful. Good luck with your test!"
2,CD did not work,"If you're buying this book because of the practice exams on the CD, dont. The format is not compatible with any new pcs or macs."
3,So far so good,Just started using this and feel that there have been small improvements. Hopefully with continued use of this and the bye bye vein leg cream I will get the results I want. Only time will tell.
3,so so,Company was said they would get in touch with me re question after 48 hours - took about 2 weeks.
4,Swelling reduced,I have seen and felt a difference in regards to vein swelling so I would recommend this product. I have been using the product for a few weeks.
3,Good but movie is better,"After seeing the movie written by Johnny Depp and his brother Daniel, I couldn't wait to read the book. Although I did enjoy the book, I can see Johnny's talent once again as he brought so much more to the story in his film..and of course his acting is unbeatable by anyone."
3,Okay. Twice as long as it needs to be.,"O'Reilly publishes some of the best, probably THE best, in the computer industry. I love their titles. However, the Missing Manual series is rather watered-down, and this title in particular is pretty boring. It seems like the author takes twice as long to explain everything, interjecting far, far too many phrases like ""before the iPod was even a twinkle in Steve Jobs's [sic] eye,"" and ""which is enough to get you from Philadelphia to Columbus on Interstate 70 with tunes to spare."" Please. Just get to the point."
4,"Great One Stop Resource, BUT...","If you have never touched an iPod or used iTunes and MusicMatch Junkebox and will be learning from scratch, then this is a wonderful book. If you learn by messing around and by trying things, then you do not need this book. Most of the info in this book can be found online as well. If you are willing to do some searching then you do not need this book. If you want a one stop resource, then it is a great book."
2,"Lightweight, too lightweight.","Many of the missing manual books are excellent, but this one, in my opinion, falls sadly short. Surely people who are interested in a technical insight to a technical device want useful details, rather than reiteration of the obvious and endless ""soggy' jokes.The book isn't without some merit, and I would recommend borrowing it from a library or a friend so you can flip through it. But, I would wait before buying it in the hope the author updates it and puts more ""meat"" into the text."
2,These are NOT Channellocks!!!! They are knock-offs!!!,"I saw these in a local hardware store and thought they were Channellocks until I looked more closely. They are ""Griplock"" pliers, but use the same handle color and design as Channellocks. They are most assuredly NOT the same quality as Channellocks (apparent from a brief examination). They are also not made in the USA, but Taiwan, I believe. Buyer beware!"
5,Bring back this etiquette,"Absolutely loved reading every word. Intelligently written yet not condescending. Traditional business etiquette is in this book...one day may be a history book. Nevertheless, it brought back good moral memories of past employment not realistically seen or experienced in many places of business today."
4,Great tool bag,"Perfect size for the home fixer upper. Good quality and I like the open pouch to put my cordless drill into during a project. Recommend this product, it's well made and not to big that it gets in the way when working."
5,Movies,"I ordered the complete 8 year DVD collection of the Smallville series as a Christmas gift, thought it would be the perfect gift and it was, he loved it and thanked me numerous times for it! Couldn't have chosen a better gift, great job!"
5,Smallville Season 1-8,"Shipping was right on schedule as promised. Even going standard to Hawaii! My Son in Law loved it! Would buy again from this seller, great prices too!"
5,Great Pictures make great learning experience,"With brilliant colors and funny baby pictures (every child is under water - swimming), this is no average colors book.Every page has many things to look at and think about, giving a young mind ample room to grow and learn."
5,Fantastic book!,"Great book for anyone who knows Riverside, You can find it the Mission Inn museum or at the Heritage House (for $25 for the reissue). There's also a companion book by Joan Hall called Cottages, Colonials, and Community Places of Riverside that is equally awesome. Must have books for anyone who loves the beautiful city of Riverside, California."
4,This will make you afraid to fly...,"Once again, the Horror Writers of America have banded together to produce an anthology of superior quality. As always, the entire anthology is centered around a central theme. This time it revolves around Dry Plains International, an airport where things happen. What kind of things? Grisly murders, viral outbreaks, demonic attacks, terrorist action, and even planes falling out of the sky.There are 29 stories by different authors. Some of the more famous authors represented in this work are Brain Hodge, Nancy Kilpatrick, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and the editor, Ramsey Cambell.As with any anthology a great many of the stories are well through out and well written, with only a few duds sprinkled throughout. My only complaint about the anthology over all was that a great many of the stories had endings that weren't really endings, a pet peeve of mine. If that's a pet peeve of yours as well, be forewarned.Over all, though, this is a good book, and well worth the money."
5,Excellent!,"Dark Debts is a modern parable of the human condition striving for the more in the future but mired in the mud of the past. Fr.Michael is the new Adam finding that he has no helpmate in his religious Eden he links up with Tess the new Eve a writer who doesn't know what she believes. With her support he strives to overcome the plight of the human condition and the evil choices of his ancestors. Question that arises, ""Is anyone responsible for sin other than the forebears from which they come"
4,A Page Turner!,"A good read - takes it a while to come together, but definitely entertaining and well written all the way thru."
5,fantastic!!!,"I am a lover of horror novels, but as of late they are all very stupid. I found this novel smart and well written. The story was not predictble and it took twists and turns that forced me to read the book from cover to cover in one day. I loved it and will be looking for more from this talented author."
1,Awful,"A pretentious piece of twaddle. Flat writing - anytime you have characters saying, ""Noooo!"" you know exactly what level of fiction you've encountered. Often unintentially humorous."
1,Laughable,"What an astonishingly silly book, chock full of stock characters shrieking sitcom dialogue. What a let down after these positive reviews."
2,Not so good...,"Not as good as lots of people are saying here. It's not deep at all, and is, to be honest, pretty silly. I don't get the positive reviews at all! Pretty much a waste of time."
5,Gripping...terrifying...it will test your faith,"DARK DEBTS is undoubtedly one of the best books I've read all year. It engages you on so many levels. Whether you are looking for a ""page turner"" to take on vacation (p.s. don't read this alone at night) or if you want something that will ask you to examine your own beliefs, this work will deliver."
2,"""Hallelujah, I believe"" disquised as a horror thriller","""The thriller of the decade"" is proudly printed on the cover of my paperback version. This is as a ridiculous statement as the book's conclusion shows itself to be. Disappointing stuff. However, the first half of the book reads quite well and the storyline seems to be ok. As the end approaches the book shows it's true colors, and all logic seeps out of the story. This is more of an evangelical ""finding your way back to God""-story and, frankly, just about as entertaining. Thriller and horror readers should look elsewhere, unless they are fallen catholics and can find something interesting and/or uplifting following the heroine's/hero's path back to religious belief. Thrilling, however, it is not!"
4,"Different, engrossing",When I started reading this book it was slow going at first. Then as the plot started falling into place and the characters linked to one another it was an engrossing read. A very different approach to the subject of religion. It did get a little cheesy and tiresome in the end but all in all it was like nothing I have read before.
5,Smart page-turner!,"This is the best book I've read in a long time! The characters are very real, the dialogue is terrific and the plot is interesting and complex, yet it moves quickly. The theological stuff is not black and white -- it is murky and I could relate to it because of that. It asks questions that I think most people ask, even if they don't ask them out loud. Good and Evil is not black and white. Even the protagonist can't figure out whether he is a good guy or a bad guy. The reader is left with that question as well. All in all, I felt that reading this book was time well spent."
5,With it and for it!,"How factual is A Youth In Babylon? Considering Friedman is one of film's sweetest talking showmen, that's hard to say. But you're not going to get a first-hand account of working with Kroger Babb and H. G. Lewis, no matter how puffed up it may sound, anywhere else. In the end, like any well delivered Elliott Forbes routine, you'll feel inspired! It may be bull, but it's still quite entertaining."
3,it's ok,"Caps are pretty good quality, the only problem was shipping, Amazon took really long time to process my order, and the customer service wasn't helpful at all, very bad experience!!!"
5,Excellent!!!!,"I have reviewed several vegetarian cookbooks, finally there is one that anyone interested in vegeterianism can follow easily. You will not believe on all the things you are missing by being a vegetarian!!!"
3,These are not SIMPLE Vegetarian Ricipes,"I'm sorry, but don't let the title of this book mislead you like it did me! The recipes average about 10 ingredients and some are items I have never heard. They are also a little time consuming in my opinion. Even a beanburger has eleven ingredients--and I have never heard of cannellini beans! This is not simple and inspiring for a beginner."
3,Typical of the genre,"My brother's been raving about Tim Green for ages, so I picked this up. Green obviously has good insights on the NFL scene, but I found his characters too perfect and predictable (really, Tim, do you have to mention that Madison is beautiful in every other paragraph?), although the ending was decent. I've been told his earlier books are better, so I may read those. This one is okay, nothing more."
3,Green Scores with a Formulaic Mystery Novel,"I picked up this book prior to a cross-country flight. I couldn't put it down and finished it in the hotel, the same day. While neither the plot nor the characters are believable (one wonders where Green comes up with the names), the book is entertaining, if nothing else. He keeps you guessing, but his over-reliance on foreshadowing can get annoying, as can his often unorthodox use of figurative language. I recommend it to anyone who wants an easy ""Grisham-esque"" read for pure fun, or to any die-hard football fans."
3,GREEN FUMBLES,"Having enjoyed other novels by Green, I found this one to be subpar. While Green shows his football background knowledge, its use merely distracts rather than enhances this story. Luther Zorn is not a sympathetic character, and Green should be ashamed of how his book concludes. While there is a satisfaction in how the killer gets his revenge, Green seems to forget all the innocent people murdered, and he lets the villain come across as some kind of avenging angel, thereby negating what has come before.Not a bad novel, but nothing to rave about."
3,belt sanding,This is one optional item that is well worth the money. It makes make my model 503 and model 360 almost glide. The friction is virtually eliminated. Your sanding belts will last until the grit is gone! The heat build up from friction is also greatly reduced. The sander will run cooler in the process. Lastly it lets the sander ride flat on the wood. Too bad Porter Cable is eliminating all of their good tools and replacing them with inferior junk. I am slowly changing over to Milwaukee power tools as Porter Cable phases out their heavy duty machines. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is that once my sanders wear out I will have no need for it as it will not fit to other belt sanders.
4,Great for Woodworking,"I bought two 50inch and two 24 inch for a series of wood projects. I found them to be easy to use and extremely strong. I mostly used them for glueing up wood together and could really bear down and watch the glue get pushed out between the joints. I could not get that with other clamps.The only thing to watch out for, is the pressure might make marks in soft wood, so I would use a 1 x 2 in between the project and the clamp, to distribute the pressure."
3,"Unusual tool, but it works","This is the only tool I could find that fits the large fittings on some of my pool equipment. It does the job, but it is not as easy to use as other vise grip products. But when there are no other options, what works is what counts."
4,"Enjoyed it up to a point...,","but I have to agree with the reviewer who felt that the first two books in this series were more entertaining.One of the best aspects of this series is the glimpse that it gives the reader into the world of serious book collecting and the Goldstones' adventures therein. That being said, nearly a quarter of this 215 page book is taken up by the story of the New England forger - which has very little bearing on the Goldstones and their collection. A semi-interesting aside, it hardly deserved to dominate the book.On the other hand, I really did enjoy reading about the visits to the Library of Congress and the Folger Library, which offered a glimpse into collections that few of us will ever have the chance to visit. Their take on the influence of the internet on the book trade was also interesting, but should there be a fourth book in the series, I hope that they will return to what they do best - relating personal stories of chasing down treasures."
5,Great for book lovers,"This pair write tales for bibliophiles, and this is their third book-about-books, featuring every aspect of the bibliouniverse, including: collecting, libraries, book fairs, catalogue and Internet trading, rare book dealers, independent booksellers, readers, and writers. In this volume, we meet Ken Anderson, the `New England Forger' who specialized in Pound, Yeats, and Eliot signed volumes before he was caught; we visit the Library of Congress, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Reading Room of the British Museum, and the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale.The two highly likable writers/readers/collectors, sometimes with daughter Emily in tow, warmly open their lives to their readers who, like them, get excited by books and appreciate the connections with people across time and place, with all their idiosyncrasies and passions. The Goldstone's books are not-to-be-missed gems."
2,Not so much,"I bought this as a study aid for my Property 1 final as a companion to the discs I listened to in the car while driving to school. Amazon messed up the shipping and through a comedy of errors, it took almost 3 weeks to arrive, which was not in time to study from it in a meaningful way.My study group and I used some of the questions for review but mostly it was a giant waste of money."
2,Black and white pics,This book had very thin pages... The pictures were all in black and white. Many did not have a good enough contrast giving the book an almost photocopied feel. Several of the excercises involved rubber bands WHICH ARE NOT anything like Sheck's functional training. It appeared that a lot of the excercises were REHAB more than actual functional methods. This book may be good for someone without a clue although more could be spent on the science behind the philosophy. Functional training is improved in that it allows one to work the ancillary muscles. You can't do that with machines... FREEWEIGHTS are the way to go. Pity this book didn't use them that much!
3,Impressive,"Yes, I know, Callas... But if you want to hear another voice in this music, Gardelli's 1967 recording is worthy of attention. Don't let the presence of Gwyneth Jones scare you away. At this early stage of her career, she possessed an immense, technically secure, powerful voice, and she unleashes everything for the big moments. Perhaps she's a little driven at times, but it fits the role perfectly. Her final scene is especially impressive. Of course, she doesn't etch out the character like Callas, nor is she as sympathetic as Rysanek. Her Italian is decidedly imperfect, too, but the big, thrilling sound compensates. Lorengar is a wonderful Glauce, singing her aria with a beautiful tone and fleet coloratura, but the rest of the cast is subpar. Cossotto, in particular, sounds bored, and Prevedi has nothing to say about this music. Recommended to anyone interested and especially to those who wonder where all the fuss about Jones comes from."
1,Disc Doesn't Play,"I want to alert everyone that this disc is a faulty product and I had to return it. The disc does not show any video on my new TV screen (the screen is black), although the audio seems to play well. I have 2 new blu-ray players that are dts-capable (Oppo and Panasonic), but neither one shows the video track. None of my other blu-ray discs have this problem.Tom"
1,I can't believe what I received as an excuse for a blu ray...,"I am at a loss for words. But please, I write this to warn potential buyers.I got a CD-R with multiple scratches on it! Someone took the care to put a label that almost looked professional.The box label was poor with much aliasing.The music was only stereo, I have a 7.1 systems and heard no DTS.Then, the disc stops and starts and then finally hangs up.This is a rip off product. Oh By the way, no video."
1,"Fraudulent Advertising!!!Don't waste your money, NOT BLU-RAY!","I purchased this product thinking I was getting a blu-ray audio disc, instead I got a dvd-r in 7.1 DTS-MA, sounded good, would not have paid [...] for it. This guy is a ripoff artist and you can see he and his friends are conspiring by posting the same drivel about how great his titles are, yet they curiously don't review anything else.....SCAM BUYER BE WARE!!!!"
2,Unprofessional product,"This disc is a home burned (duplicated, not replicated) dual layer DVD.As a result it may not play without problems in some Blu-ray players.It will also be more prone to errors if scratched and have a shorter shelf life."
2,"I receive the same cup, but different top and straw.. they have wrong picture as advertise",advertise the wrong top for cup .. the straw it's in the middle and doesn't bring away to close the straw. like the picture it's advertising. I wish I could return it. I really don't like it.
5,Important Documentary,"This documentary gives valuable insight into the FLDS, a closed community of polygamist extremists living near the Utah/Arizona border. You should watch it."
1,Nothing About The Decision Making!,"Sheldon M. Stern speaks of only the what-ifs that surrounded the President before and after the actual event of President John F. Kennedy. From within 5 minutes of President Kennedy learning of the USSR missile-ship coming towards Cuba to after the US ships escorted the USSR missile-ship to open sea I was on one line with President Kennedy, with Nikita Khrushchev on another line and Fidel Castro on another line- the 4-line phone set-up had been installed in my home by the US State Department 5 years before. The US got it's money worth that time. Sheldon M. Stern made much money repeating speculation and gossip of those who pretended to know."
5,Super Reader,"Another important installment of the Eternal Champion series, and the third book in the first Corum trilogy.Corum Jhaelen Irsei, ever resourceful, has taken out the Queen of the Swords, and now has to face the most powerful of this suit, the King.He is most definitely not without help and resources, as here, he joins to become the ultra-hero Three-Who-Are-One, with both Elric and Erekose."
2,"""CUTTING EDGE"" COMEDIANS NOT CUTTING ENOUGH FOR ME","When I read about this DVD on Amazon I thought it would be a great compilation of some of the greatest comedians of yesteryear. Maybe I expected too much from clips that were made in the sixties and seventies, when broadcast regulations bolstered censorship rulings. George Carlin and Richard Pryor in particular, appeared bland and flat.I guess for me the interesting thing about this DVD was witnessing the transformation some of today's most raucous and rebellious comedians made. Still, overall I was disappointed."
1,Total disappointment,"Cutting edge comedians, without their cutting edge material. What a letdown... only the safest routines, with completely inane commentary (""One thing is certain. We all like to laugh."" How profound.)Don't waste your money."
2,Cutting Edge Comedians?,Save your money. Not that funny. A few funny moments but you have to sit so long to get to it. I would not watch it again.
5,A classic - indispensable,"What size you end up getting will be determined by the kind of work you do with it, but for me, the 16"" version of this classic design was perfect. Enough grunt to take care of stubborn fasteners, yet comfortable in the hand. I have Knipex pliers in smaller sizes, but for a larger T&G pair, the Channellock version does the job very well."
5,The Real Deal,The difference between a real tool and a cheap knock off is amazing. This is the real deal -- very solid. The pliers are a lasting investment in preventing skinned knuckles caused by poor tool design and materials. I'm very pleased.
4,Huge,This was the biggest set of pliers I have ever seen. Takes two hands just to use them. But as with all channelock products they are good quality.
3,Neat but abbreviated,"A fun look at the origination of the tulip in Holland with beautiful illustrations, this book would make a great launching point for a lesson plan on the tulip or on Holland. Unfortunately, the account does not quite convey the incredible importance of the tulip in Dutch culture and economics and it is very poorly edited with one of the main characters sometimes being named Henrick and sometimes Hendrick. Overall worthwhile but not a book that will become your favorite bedtime story."
3,Showcase of lesser-know dark electro acts,"Johan Van Roy (Suicide Commando, Lescure 13, db.F, COde, PBR) offers us the second installment in the excellent 'Voltage' series. The first, released only on tape, featured many predominant acts in their earliest stages of development. Acts like Hypnoskull, Frames A Second, Lescure 13, Mildreda, Stin Scatzor, N.M.E., and Monolith, effectively show-casing the hidden talents behind some of the darkest electro acts in the Belgian and German underground scenes. 'Voltage II' continues the legacy, offering the listener a glimpse of what has been going on in the dark electro realm besides convenient Metropolis releases. Acts presented here include Pain Station, Suicide Commando, SaVaK, Hocico, Sleepwalk, Mildreda, Assemblage 23, Digital Blood, and much more. Although the selections here are not exclusive, nevertheless this is a good way to get better acquainted with some of the lesser-known dark electro acts lurking in the shadows."
5,Love Undergrads!,Pete Williams is a genius! He's like a geeky verison of Mike Judge. He does all of the voices so well and the real life experiences are so true and entertaining. It's a same they didnt make it for a Sophomore Season. Nevertheless a great series! Highly Recommend-Steveo
1,poor production values hurt shows,"Fans of Animation Beware! Undergrads suffers from poor production values. The biggest gripe being that the characters in the show are constantly being presented to you in a 3/4 angle wich never varies. No profiles, No Frontal, not even a 2/4. Just 3/4, 3/4, 3/4. I refuse to belive that the Animators/storyboarders/character desingers made this glaring ommision to be ""Stylistic"". To me it just seems as if they were being lazy.Even the Power Puff Girls varie in angles.Recommended only if you like their sence of Humor and are not irratated by the constant 3/4 angles."
5,"Want to help keep this show on the air, buy the DVD!","This show provides an outrageously funny, though sometimes incredibly accurate portrayal of adapting to college life. Though MTV buried the show on its first run, reruns on Comedy Central/Teletoon has created an at least cult following among the 18-25 set.The first season builds the characters well and remains fresh until the end. At the end of this DVD, you'll be aching to find out what happens in sophomore year. The problem is that the show needs financial backing in order to produce more episodes.By buying the DVD of the first season, you would contribute to the production of a second season. If sales figures are impressive enough, chances are that a cable network may pick up the tab for a new season.So, for those who love the show in the U.S. and Canada, buy the DVD ... Let's get another season going!For anyone else who remembers what college life was/is like, you'll be amused and amazed at how this show rings true..."
5,Undergrads is an amazing show,"Undergrads is by far my favorite show on tv right now, i love it. It's humor is great and i instantly fell in love with each and every one of the characters. HELP KEEP UNDERGRADS ALIVE!!sign this petition in hopes of seeing another season on tv soon!...Thanks guy, Long live Undergrads!!"
4,Porter Cable batteries,"I own the porter cable combo pack with the saw boss, tiger saw, hammer drill and flashlight and two batteries. The batteries seem to get the job done with the drill but with the saws, the life of the charge seems alittle short for what they cost, they do charge fast and have alot of power, but for the moderate user, I recommend a third battery, also take extra precaution with the charger as it is not that tough and a few drops to the floor can damage the fuse, that is sodered in. (extremely bad design) should allow the user to be able to replace the fuse .........note mine is only 6 months old too at the time of this review......chad"
1,same thing here,"I'm very disappointed about the battery performance. I have been using my drill for 3 years and I already changed the motor one time. Now, I needed new batteries but the price is way too much. Bye-bye Portal cable, I'll never buy your tools again."
3,Short Life,I have owned my Porter Cable Drill/Driver for 6 months and one of the 2 batteries that came with it just got a blinking red light on the charger which means that it is going bad!
5,Quick service on a hard to find item,"Love the power and stamina of my old Porter-Cable 19.2 outfit, but the batteries are old, too. This replacement is the correct factory unit and arrived promptly in new condition, original packaging, as advertised.Thanks!"
2,Design flaws ruin it,"haysee74 is exactly right. I've owned the combo tiger saw and drill pack for several years now, although I've never used the drill. It's seen very occasional use, and has performed ok. But now the soldered fuse in my charger is blown, and I'm not going to spend $90 for a new one. Porter Cable would be fine if it weren't for the design flaws - that seem intentional."
1,poor battery performance,I'm now purchasing the third battery for my Porter Cable 9884. The tool has been fine but the battery life is unacceptable. I just purchased another tool (Makita drill driver and battery life has been much superior).Will not purchase another Porter Cable cordless tool though I have several other Porter Cable tools.With a price of $85.00 I expect much higher quality.
3,mediocre performance,"I have owned the porter cable combo pack for a couple of years, using it in my construction business. I have had battery performance problems from the begining, particularly with the saws (replaced one charger too) I always felt I was paying the price for getting a good deal on E-bay, although I purchased it new in the box. I came on this site to purchase two new batteries to see if that would solve my problem, but after reading the reviews I am wondering if I should just put that $180.00 toward a new combo set from a different manufacturer. I have always been a Porter-Cable fan but am disappointed with this product. Because of the performance problems, I almost never use the circular or recip saws. Essentially I have a $500.00 hammer drill and flashlight."
1,"Again, one monolithic vision of dystopia.","Though most of Ballard's work contains unvarying plots, motifs, characters, etc., I was quite stunned to find that `Super Cannes' and `Cocaine Nights' are - albeit with minor tweaks and variations - actually one and the same book. From the backdrops to the manic idiosyncrasies of the characters, the key components in each enjoy such thorough correspondences and identity that a synopsis of one book effectively adumbrates the other. It seems Ballard's technique of thematic reiteration and repetition has achieved such perfection as to suggest that an author has finally (and remarkably) cloned his own work and slipped it over the transom. Read both books if you wish to scrutinize the sublime homogeneity of Ballard's imagination. Or pick one or the other, and feel satisfied that you've economized on money and time."
3,The future is now,"Remarkably visionary, like all Ballard, but sometimes pedantic and plodding. There are also some timeline and character development weaknesses.Growing up in a ""planned community,"" it is easy to appreciate the potential for a racist underbelly. Ballard takes it one step further."
1,Disaster!,"From the beginning of ""Cannes"", I feel like I am re-reading Cocain Nights. Nothing new! What a bad plot! We have got a hero, whose adventure resembles to the events which happens to the Rare Window's main character. Believe me, you should still read, as having been read 200 hundred pages, someone saying: ""Paul! Be careful! Eden-Olympia is a strange or mysterious place etc. etc.""Actually Ballard takes the old idea that, in the contemporary world, our only way for escape from the business world is ""sex-sport"". Or maybe one must dive or fly or climb etc. etc. Now exaggerate that, here is the Eden-Olympia's lust and murder therapy!It is just dissapointing for modern novel.One of the editors describes this book as surreal. If you look for something surreal and really enjoyable, read Aragon's Anicet or Panaroma!"
3,mostly common sense,"I expected more from this book. It gives do's and don'ts, but most of which we already know. It spends too much time telling the reader how to tell their child that they love them. I quess for a few parents out there this is a difficult task but that's the least of my problems. Overall it seems to give guidelines but no helpful examples. It's like reading a text book for parenting, not a book of real life experiences."
2,Pressure? What pressure?,"Unlike the previous reviewer I felt that these delivered very little clamping pressure. I own several of the larger Irwin clamps and compared to them this is one very disappointing clamp. I'll keep the two I've got for special situations where a little clamping will do, but certainly will not buy any more."
5,A Soundtrack for Life,"Lovely lovely soundtrack to the clubbing scene. The movie is extremely funky and oh so true to the club scene. This soundtrack makes me feel the movie over and over again. Makes me not forget the euphoria of clubbing.The first CD covers all blends of dance music - from hip hop to jungle to downbeat - it is all there with some of the best moments from the movie. (I was looking for the ""Who is the Queen?"" track though - disappointed it was not in the soundtrack).The second CD is a heavenly mix CD. Track 11 onwards is pure bliss. Pete Tong is the man.GET IT, WATCH THE MOVIE, SPACE OUT!"
5,excellent,"""proper rave jams""?! i'd like to know what you mean by that 'steve from USA'. There were plenty of proper rave jams in the movie! This was an excellent movie, really the truest picture of the scene that i've seen in a movie yet. The music in this film succeeded in capturing exactly the what the film was trying to convey. the 'proper rave jams' of which 'steve from usa' speaks dont belong to this soundtrack any more than Brittany Spears does. If you want to listen to prodigy, go buy a prodigy cd. If you want to an excellent soundtrack with wonderful electronica, then buy this soundtrack."
1,No UK 'Ardkore... WTF?,"I heard so much about this movie. I even saw a rather amusing video clip of it where the record store owner plays a jump up jungle record. However now that I see the tracklisting of the CD I'm shocked with horror that there isn't any proper rave jams on here. No Altern-8, no Acen, no Prodigy Experience, no Foul Play or Noise Factory. Sad!"
5,one in a million cd,"If you never seen this movie, you must. The soundtrack is awesome. Lots of old school tracks that bring back great memories."
4,true to the movie,"One thing I really enjoyed about these cd's is the sound clips from the movie itself. It helps to set the mood for these club songs. If you liked the movie or just like rave style music, then this cd is for you."
2,short on info.,"i bought this book for my wife, but it seemed the main goal was to sell you products. there were little tid bits of information, nothing solid. mostly the point was beauty was in the eyes of the beholder. a quick read only."
3,For my commuter bike,"I agree that it is not as comfortable to ride when you aren't clipped in. They will due for what i do, and that is commute."
5,Works like a charm,"I only have about 40 miles on these, but I think that's enough to write a review about the comfort. Exactly what I had hoped for. Nothing is perfect for both clip-less and clipped riding, but these are a good mix. Very comfortable without my cleats, but still very easy to clip in quickly. Only complaint is how wide they are, easy to clip the ground in a hard lean."
5,Just a quick note,"I haven't been able to use them yet, but just wanted to let people that are interested in buying these know that you will need metric allen wrenches to adjust them. I don't own a bike tool, so I don't know if the size is common. Just wanted to let others know, as I am going to have to buy one before I can use them. I have rated these with 5 stars only for the fact that they seem to be really great quality and didn't take long to receive. Also, they do come with a set of clips."
4,Generally solid if they are what you are looking for.....,I agree with a couple of other reviews. These are called dual use and it says you don't need to clip in. This is true. I agree that it is not as comfortable to ride when you aren't clipped in (I actually use a softer shoe when I don't clip in and I'm just running a quick errand). These are heavy but I don't notice that on my mountain bike.I like being able to clip in on both sides so I can just step on my pedals and go and if you are like me then this is probably for you. If you don't mind making sure the pedal is on the proper side then you might be happier with a different pedal.I find it MUCH easier to unclip by turning my heel in and have to adjust the pedals nearly as loose as possible.
3,"Acceptable multi-purpose pedals, but there's better out there","These are decent pedals. I use them on my Felt Q620 MTB so I can lock in on for more serious rides, yet have the flexibility to just jump on for a ride around the block with my kids wearing whatever shoes I happen to have on. But, like all things designed to do two things, it does neither of them well. It's a little difficult to lock my cleats into and out of the pedal. Not impossible, just not as responsive as other pedals I've had. Also, when wearing regular non-cycling shoes, it can be uncomfortable to ride for too long on these pedals. The bracket that holds the cleat on each side sits slightly above the black cage which tends to both add pressure to the bottom of my foot and push my foot off the pedal. OK for quick rides around the block with the kids, but not much more.Would I buy these particular pedals again? No. But, I don't plan to replace them either."
5,Love These Clamps!,"Buy these by the dozen for welding clamps. Good clamp for the money. Yes, they are lighter than my older clamps, but still get the job done. Have about 30 now and would buy again. A must for welding trailer frames, floors, etc."
5,"walker muffler, good quality, good fit","this muffler is the exact replacement for my 1994 chevy K1500 silverado 4X4 extended cab short bed pickup,with 5.7L engine.not much i can say other than it fits and it works and it was a good price with free shipping. best deal i could find anywhere.Walker 18216"
3,they're ok,"these shoes are really sexy; i have only worn them one time. i must confess that the first time i wore them, i fell. the bottom is very slippery, even though the sole is supposed to be leather. i recommend placing slip guards on the bottom of the shoe if you are purchasing the shoe."
3,Get The Electric Brake,This is a lite saw. I purchased it as a replacement update for a Milwaukee saw that is twenty five years old. I loan the Porter Cable and use the Milwaukee. I find this saw too lite for my liking. It is well made and my exwife has barrowed it several times. My daughter perfers the Porter Cable. If you do buy it get a modle with an electric break - it is safer and speeds cuts that are complex.
5,Porter Cable Model 237 rocks!,"Bought this in 1995 when I bought my first house. It has never failed me. There are cheaper saws, but this model reliably keeps on snapping the guard back, which I can't say for the others, so I can confidently set it down WITHOUT damaging the blade. It just works, every time. I would by another in a minute - if it ever died!"
3,"It's Good, But...","The saw is light weight, powerful, and has a great base, but it has many drawbacks. The dust chute manages to blow sawdust in your face and down your back no mater which way it is pointed. Put the bag on it (should be included but isn't) and it usually clogs down at the narrowed throat of the saw (the narrow portion is a real chokepoint, I don't know why they designed it like that -- have been tempted to drill it out). The case seems to be very large on the outside but doesn't hold the edge guide (should be included but isn't) inside. The shaft lock button is small, hard to get at, and hurts your finger to press and hold to change blades. The lever that controls raising and lowering the blade is hard to loosen in the blade down position. I just bought a new Milwaukee saw and am going to sell off the Porter Cable. It's OK but has too many aggravations!"
4,Useful outlines and comments,"I have an old copy of this book. The line drawings would be useful for anyone who needs a basic outline, whether for drawing or sewing or some other need. The subjects are very 70's-ish, but that seems to be back in style now anyway (i.e. strawberries, mushrooms, owls, girls with big goofy hats). I like the background that the book gives on ""crafts"" also."
3,Quantity vs Quality,"A good all around beginner's guide, touching an about every subject from the Internet to HTML, from copyrights to vanity publishing. That's why there are 49 chapters with some only 2 pages long. But there are many references to additional information when something peaks your interest and you want to learn more.If you are at all knowledgeable about on-line communications, websites, HTML and domain names it will be very rudimentary. But if you use it as a reference book, using the index and then looking up the URLs and book references cited, it's a good guide."
3,This Can Help You,"I bought How to Get Your E-Book Published: An Insider's Guide to the World of Electronic Publishing from Writer's Digest Book Club. It was on sale, and I was curious to see if it would help me when my SF novelette, Hidebound, comes out as an e-book. (It's been published in print; I decided to go the e-book route too.) It's from 2002 so some things are way out-dated (oh, the changes since then!), but there's lots of interesting history, background, and resources. I think it's helpful; it covers the basics, and I learned a lot about the Internet too, AND it made me less fearful of html. Some websites are probably gone, but I know some are still viable; I'll do a little browsing. I think the resources and background make the book worth buying. The two authors appear to be knowledgeable in their fields."
4,All Aboard the Ebook Express.,"Curtis & Quick have presented a valuable service to authors who would like to get published on the ww web. They add as many warnings as they do hype the hopes for new authors. Although many people have lost their shirts betting on the growth of e-shopping, the authors cover all the bases for playing in this arena. ...They add a list of all the internet sites that an author could hope to visit in his or her quest for publication. Their advice to open a personal web site and publicize it, for example, by adding a link in your four line e-mail signature is excellent. Very little is left out, for example, anyone can download the free Acrobat eBook Reader. Precise html web pages of many ebook publishers are supplied (even if these pages change the reader should be able to locate the new page). Regardless of how soon the info becomes outdated this is a five star effort."
5,please disregard the 2007 review,"Please disregard the disgruntled review by Lyraka who wanted poems about mermaids and could not stomach that mermaids were ""dugongs or dolphins"" in Christopher Reid's clever title poem. Charles Simic selected these poems for an American audience (from Reid's first five books published in England) and did an exemplary job. Reid is a master of the short poem although his long poem """"Survival: A Patchwork"" is poignant and deft.If you stopped reading English poetry at Hughes or Larkin, then you're in for a treat. Reid has enough verbal antics and sly humor for several rereadings. Reid is brilliant; I highly recommend these poems to you.(He is also one of the poets anthologized by Charles Simic and Don Patterson in New British Poetry published by Graywolf-also recommended.)"
1,This book reeks,The poems are about swiss cheese and farting. NOT ABOUT MERMAIDS!!!!! This book needs a new title. I bought this book to read poems about mermaids like the title suggests. Horribly disappointed.
2,"12 partial songs from Frank, Dean and Sammy","Total running time is 23 minutes. Cuts include:Me and My Shadow - Sammy Davis, Jr. (2:20)Please Be Kind - Sinatra (2:22)I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter - Dean Martin (1:40)She's Funny That Way - Sammy Davis, Jr. (1:35)Too Marvelous For Words - Sinatra (0:47)Goody Goody - Sinatra (1:27)Embraceable You - Dean Martin (1:41)Chicago (That Toodlin' Town) - Sinatra (2:06)Bewitched - Sinatra (3:06)I Can't Give You Any Thing But Love - Dean Martin (0:57)All The Way - Sinatra (3:39)A Foggy Day - Sinatra (1:24)Some songs are in concert. Recording quality is acceptable."
3,I wasn't moved...nor did I fall asleep....,"When you read the jacket of any book, it gives you a brief description of the book. In my opinion the jacket or back cover for Hot Snakes Nights give you exactly what this book is, nothing more.Cole Riley writes a simple story of Frank and Mary Boles life in the Delta. While poor and uneducated Mary tries to raise 6 chillren,each with its own issue: 1 mentally challenged, 1 a born liar and a daughter experimenting with sex.The Boles family coined the phrase ""If it wasn't for bad luck I would have no luck"". Everytime you think this family will get it together something jumps up and snatches them right back where they were.In my opinion this book left me wanting more. I especially would like to know why its titled ""Hot Snake Eyes""."
1,!!!!!!NO MUSIC!!!!!!!,"THIS CD HAS ABOSOLUTELY NO MUSIC ON IT WHATSOEVER!!!! If anyone has written a review suggesting otherwise, then they are mistaken - and are probably referring to a real Counting Crows album - all of which are very good - unlike this pile of pants."
2,Just OK,"I LOVE the Counting Crows music, but this CD did not impress me at all. I listened to it once and threw it in a drawer. If you are a fan, you will not glean anything from this CD that you didn't already know. Save your money."
2,"Spend your $13 on a concert ticket, not this cd.","I picked up this cd after seeing Rainer Maria live in Minneapolis. It was an amazing show, and I bought the the album hoping it would remind me of that night. I was really disappointed at the sound quality and setlist on the live cd. It's nothing special. The dvd, on the other hand, is better. Watching the band and how they move is half the show. However, it doesnt seem like their best performance. There's nothing like the real thing. See them live if you get the chance.If you're new to Rainer Maria, pick up one of their studio albums instead. They're a great emo band. This cd doesn't do them justice."
3,I love the band/ hate this product spewed at me,"It does not capture how the band can be powerful live. The DVD is something of a joke at my house. While the out of tune singing/screaming is dismissable live and fixed through the magic of production on your CD, its a little annoying while sitting on your couch,..sober...with your roomates laughing at you for liking rainer maria in the first place.But i still love them, brilliant song writing and bad singing alike. BUt this is pretty worthless except for the blindest of blind rainer maria collectors. Use your money for a Ranier Maria Rilke poetry collection...youll find more enlightenment. The videos focus on the "" look how hip and cool we look, we read camus and have vintage clothing!"""
2,Misleading,"Looks nice, but CHEAP QUALITY! Why don't the sides of the drawer on the insides go up as high as on the front? And they don't pull out all the way. I doubt it will last long. You get what you pay for."
3,Okay entertainer,"t has some of the funniest scenes in a movie this year. Akshay needed more scenes in the 2nd half, but he did quite well. Suniel was okay. Paresh was funny and loud. Kat had no scope, same with Sameer. Neha acted well. Johnny was amazing, this movie belongs to him.What I liked about the movie:Akshay, Johnny, Paresh, Neha, climax, songsWhat I didn't like about the movie:Weak story, Akshay needed more scenesWould you recommend this movie to your friend: YesUser Movie Rating: 3/5"
4,A very good read,This book is full of very helpful information and awesome affirmations to use in your daily life. I would highly recommend it
2,The love you deserve: A spiritual guide to genuine love,"I bought this book because it was packaged with a book by M. Scott Peck,""The road less travelled"". This book SHOULD NOT be package with any of M.Scott Peck's work, since it leads one to believe that the above book was co-authored by him. ""The love you deserve..."" is a light weight bit of fluff that is not anywhere near the caliber of the work of M.Scott Peck,and the advice in this book is simply not practical."
1,Wrong Scott Peck,"I received my copy of 'The Love You Deserve: 10 Keys To Perfect Love' and found it was written by Scott Peck but not M. Scott Peck. The two authors apparently are different as Scott Peck is described as having a Master's degree in Education and having been a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor. Dr. M. Scott Peck was a psychiatrist. Also, politely stated, the writing styles of these two men are quite different. Sorry Scott Peck but your book should not be included with those of M. Scott Peck."
1,Warning! This is Not the M. Scott Peck of the The Road Less,"I haven't read this book, but I have read the reviews. This is not the M. Scott Peck of the The Road Less Travelled. I just finished reading M. Scott Peck's ""Glimpses of the Devil"" in which he made reference to his first wife, Lily, as if they were still married so I am assuming that he is still married. If you enjoyed the Road Less Travelled and found it to be a challenging and helpful book, this is NOT the same author and you will very likely be disappointed."
5,Excellent,"Fat Possum Records, a new discovery for me. These are raw edge blues songs. If you are looking for BB King, it's not here. They are played the way you'd hear them in a club.The good news with this CD - Track 2 - The Set You Free, by The Black Keys, is one of the theme songs for Nissan Xterra that played during the olympics (the snow boarding version).The other good news, for $7 how can you possibly go wrong?"
5,Perfect,"Item was nicely cherried up, looks like former office lease equipment. Exact replacement of my old Dell monitor that just went phhht after 4 years. Wanted the same thing to match system and fit in desk space. Price was right, got it in 2 days!"
1,Disappointment,"It was a color monitor but only some colors worked, most were gray or light yellow. Clearly, there was a problem with the unit. But on the positive side, Amazon backed me up and jumped right in when the Vendor did not respond to my initial request for a refund. For that reason, I will continue to shop Amazon with confidence!"
4,it a pretty good monitor,it a good basic way to go even with the resolution all the way up it looks ok but movies look really good when play on it but pics looking at the web just ok but i am still happy with it and last a long time had mine for 7 years now
2,Dim and too many dead pixels to count.,"I have compared this monitor to many others and this is the worst one I have had yet. Sitting by my Samsung Syncmaster 150s, another 15 inch LCD monitor with even more use than this one, I can tell that this monitor is a lot more dim than the Syncmaster. This monitor was made in 2004, but that shouldn't mean much, because the other one was made in 2002, and its image quality far surpasses this one's. I also have another problem with this monitor. The screen has dead pixels all over it. I'm talking about 50. I don't know how this happened but to me that seems WAY too high of a number. It is normal for some monitors to have 1 or even 2 if they're old, but really, that is too high. I would not recommended it."
4,A very fine book by Danish-German Thies Christopherson which casts serious doubt on the tall tales of extermination...(read on),"The late Thies Christopherson was a Wehrmacht(regular german army) Lt. and not a member ofthe NUTZI party. Christopherson was severlywounded near France in 1940 and got transferredto the Auschwitz camp, which seerved as a tran-sit camp for deportations of Warsaw ghetto jewsand others who deemed to be hamrful to the ger-man wartime effort. Christopherson was workingon a project to develop 'buna' rubber of of'kok sakis' plants for harm weather extremes(hot or cold). He saw no 'gas chambers', et, al.But did note what other Revisionists, such asSwedish Ditlieb Felderer did; a large Olympicsized pool for inmates recreation, and a playhouse where the immates put on shows, et, al.So where were the exterminations? If you seeFred Leuchter's film, you'll know the answer.For headaches, take two Arthur Butz books andcall me in the morning!"
1,No Warranty+++No Response at all.,"One of the clamps we had broke and I sent it back to them as instructed. I never received a reply, no clamp, no response at all. I would consider their Warranty USELESS. We are going to buy a few of the Craftsman brand and try them out."
1,Horrible,"Wow... I'm a PC junkie and gamer and this game is really bad. The storyline is bad, the graphics are bad, the voices for some of the characters are irritating... the list goes on.I wondered why it was on sale... because no one is buying it. I tried to play online, but no one else was on, anywhere... I assume everyone else has either sold theirs or thrown it away.I just quit playing... I couldn't stand the poor graphics, acting, and voices any longer.Not worth your dollar (not even just one).Too bad I can't leave zero stars or it would get it!"
5,Porter-Cable battery,"My 5 year-old Porter Cable drill-driver gets lots of use. I replaced the first original battery through Amazon.com a year or so ago and was satisfied with it. So when the 2nd original battery died last month, I ordered through A.com again."
4,Hope this battery lasts longer than the original,"Great drill but crappy batteries. I hope this replacement battery lasts longer than the original. I bought this drill because I used one like it at work and really felt it to be a good tool. Our company no longer uses these drills because the batteries don't last. The jury is still out on this replacement. Porter Cable should come up with a better battery for this quality tool. I know that 12v are almost passe but, hey...how about some corporate responsibility? and respect for the customer and need I go on about land fills and throw away thinking."
2,Needs more quality,"This is a very good drill the battery fits in, but alas it wears out fast. Porter cable should beef up replacement batteries for customers buying them."
2,Must have been on the shelf for a while,"It is the correct OEM battery and it is new in the package, but it doesn't hold a charge very long. Probably sitting on the shelf too long."
3,acceptable,Battery arrived packaged well. Holds a charge at least as well as the originals I have. I would recommend this product.
5,Leontyne Price she's Tosca¡,"Leontyne Price is with Tebaldi and Callas the very Tosca. In this recording she's togeter di Stefano and Taddei, both again thr very Cavaradossi and Scarpia. Karajan it`s a very good condudtor. This performance of Tosca is togeter Callas/di Stefano/Gobbi/de Sabata and Tebaldi/Tucker/Warren/Mitropoulos the only very best performances of this opera. But Leontyne she's The Divina not Callas."
4,Culshaw is unbeatable,"This Decca recording indeed is another masterpiece by John Culshaw. The beginning sounds like your sitting in the orchestra pit. Culshaw achieves all of this great sound without making it sound like a recording session. The singing is wonderful. Taddei may not have the most beautiful baritone voice, but is a perfect characterization for Scarpia. Price is magnificent and is especially intense in the last act when she discovers that Mario is dead. Di Stefano was a great artist but sounded nasal later in the opera when freedom in the high notes are crucial. I think Corena is delightful as the Sacristan, just listen to when he rebukes Mario in the first act,(Fuori, satana fuori). Karajan is, well, Karajan, and in his conducting there is really nothing more to say.Besides maybe the Colin Davis set for Phillips this is definitely the stereo recording to have."
1,"Boring, dull - don't waste your money",Not worth reading and a definte waste of money unless you want something to put you to sleep.
1,The worst ever,1st of all I suppose to receive the product on the 7th of Dec. I just received today the 29th of Dec.2nd every time I print the content does not print on the exact circle and always have a little bit hanging out which ruin the printed cover I used the 8931 which is equivalent to the 8960 because I couldn't find the 8960 at all.Generally guys it was the worst thing I've ever bought through the internet
4,Nice printable Label,If used this and they always work great with my printer. I would have rated a 5 but the price is a little high for my taste.
4,Decent product,"Nothing spectacular, but it works as advertised.OK - here is thirteen more required words to fill up space on your comment box. Your comment box deserves a lousy rating."
2,These are ok,These stick very well but do not look professional on the discs these are great if you are just going to use them at home not business use
4,They're fine,"The labels and spine labels that come on the same form are just fine--they're what I needed. For some reason the format that shows the outline of the disk and spine labels disappears if I make a wrong ""enter"" or ""escape"" and I've had to close it out and bring it back up again before I can add the information. But that being said, they work fine, they stick nice and tight - but I even had to peel one up to put it on a disk that worked, and I could do that, too. So I'm happy."
1,Warning,If you have anything other then the Avery Applicator this product will not be easy to work with. The tabs don't always remove easily and does not line up with a Memorex or generic applicator. These are different from the Avery CD labels I bought from Amazon just 3 weeks ago. Not to mention they are WAY overpriced.
1,half the tire for twice the price,I saw these at my local tire shop. Not the same tire a use to use. The thread seams half gone and the price way too high for what you get.
2,Kindle Version Incomplete,"While I am not even 25% of the way through the book, in the Kindle Version there are numerous instances with incomplete sentences, suggestions, and techniques are also missing. This clearly seems to be a formatting issue, nonetheless it detracts from the value of the book. I suggest waiting until the correct this."
3,Good Book - But Needs More Actions Steps,This is strait forward to the point book using business examples on how and why getting famous can help you and your business. It provides lots of examples but could use more action steps on how to build your own celebrity.Author of the bookValue Forward Selling - How to Sell Managementhttp://www.howtosellmanagement.com
5,Good dice cup,It is pretty sturdy and relatively quiet for being something you shake a bunch of dice around in. It looks like they finally updated the title and description to state that it is in fact a single dice cup with a set of 5 dice. (They also seem to have deleted my original review where I complained about the bad description)
4,Heavy Duty!,"The material of the wall, along with the rubber pad on the bottom, reduce the noise generated by the cup quite a bit. And my goodness is this thing durable. I have no hesitation allowing the kids to play with it all they want.The dice it comes with are really terrible. -1 Star.For us P&P; RPG'rs, this can roll 5 d20 with ease.Added Later:Having used this cup along side the kids Yahtzee cup... I am glad I bought this. Its slightly bigger and less then half as loud."
4,Very quiet,"This dice cup was great for the price, and it is very quiet! The grip is kind of awkward because the silhouette is like a capital ""I"" (does that make sense?), but it's not like you really need a firm hold on it--it's just a dice cup. The dice were fine."
1,It sucked,This is an awful book I really hated it alan Marshall must have been deluded to write it the characters are all mediocre copies from other books and the referals to the people in a hospital are all pathetic i had to stop reading before i made myself sick I would warn everyone away from this book unless they are Pathetic
2,Where's the beef?,"This book is great if you are looking for a high level book on to manage a customer, but there is not much real meat when it comes to the requirements. Example: he suggests having a workshops to build communication between the customer and the supplier. However, there is not much there in the first half of the book on how to go about actually gathering and managing reqrirements.I am looking for a book to help me when I already have good communications with my customer, and I need to start producing results.I am returning this book"
2,112 pages of nothing,"The book has very few plans in it, so if your looking for a how to build something type of book, THIS IS NOT IT."
3,Limp Bizkit are here,"If you wanna listen to everything about Limp Bizkit which you wanna know you have absolutely to listen to this cd . you' ll find this very interesting , more than what you can expect . i am a Limp Bizkit fan and i think every fan should have this cd . It is fantastic ."
1,As if the music wasn't bad enough,"This biography gave me oh so much insight into what a great artistic soul Fred Durst is. I can't believe how much he used to practice his guitar in his garage, writing sincere introspective songs just for himself and not caring at all about what sells records or what's going on with MTV. Just like Kurt Cobain and Jimmy Hendrix before him, Fred always promised himself never to sell-out. He refused to embrace the mainstream or dumb down any of his music just for the sake of pleasing the masses. And when his music became popular, he was constantly battling his record company for the right of creative control of his music. God, I wish I was Fred."
1,No thanks,"Yea, I guess it was good if your a semi-fan. But a die-hard fan like myself was very dissapointed. Not only did they forgot to mention their artistic integrity they also forgot to mention there harsh struggle to rise to the top. Overall somebody didn't do their homework. Very dissapointed......(total sarcasm)"
3,It was okay.,"This biography wasn't what I expected. It was hard to understand what they were saying at times and they didn't talk about interesting topics. I am still happy I bought it though but if you are expecting a great cd, keep looking."
2,boring,Just like the fist review of this i was disappointed to find it wasn't a music cd at all. It was a biography and i found it boring.A woman came on and talked how the band was formed and events that happened to them. i'm a true limp bizkit fan and i new most of the information on it.
5,The most beautiful recording of the Barber.,"Although I have been Bell's fan for years, this recording truly marked him as a marvel of lyricism and technique. The very difficult moto perpetuo like 3rd mvmt, which some called unreadable, was the weakest of the Barber, but the straining beauty of the 1st and 2nd mvmts were too great to criticize anymore of that concerto. Bell did a great job in Baal-Shem of distinguishing each mvmts characteristics. The very difficult and beautiful Walton concerto was played well with the Baltimore Symphony. I was so dissapointed to hear Perlman's recording of the Barber. Perlman was a little too forceful to carry to melodic violin line but his 3rd mvmt was better. I also thought that Joshua Bell should have won the Grammy this year. Better luck next year with the Gershwin Fantasy, I guess."
4,This toy is great !,I liked this toy because it looks cool when it's put together and is almost unbreakable. It looked hard to build but it wasn't because the directions made it easy. There are lots of games you can play with this set. It's easy to use your imagination.
3,Damaged cans but good product,"This is a good product. I don't have the B-12 info on it but am assuming B-12 must be present as clams have it. These are advertised high in iron and protein. I like it because there's no additives, salt, just the boiled clams for whatever use you make of them. However, of the 12 cans in this order, 4 arrived damaged - bent - and I'm not sure if that has a significant effect on safety or not."
3,Good dance music,but this series of cds has a tendency to use a dj technic of making songs sound like they are skipping. Plus they also add some really corny tunes which you would not normally want. Granted you do have a chjance to hear songs you might not have ever had the opportunity to hear but so aren't worth the space wasted on the cd.
5,awesome,I can not get this product where I live so I always order this from Taylors Market! Awesome service!!! THANKS!!!!!!!
1,FPI,"$9 for a 1 lb of pasta????? What is this?? I don't want even to try it. I am pretty sure this is a good product and De Cecco is very well known name, however......"
2,The cell phone adapter for Samsung,"The cell phone adapter, which is why I mainly purchased this flashlight, doesn't work well at all like it says. Very disappointing. The flashlight, however, works very well."
1,No battery life at all,"Received this a week ago, it's OK in a pinch, but this flashlight has ZERO battery life ""memory"". That is, I can crank and crank, and the light is usable and bright for a reasonable period of time. But crank it up and then set the flashlight aside for an hour or two, and it's DEAD. I have other crank lights that hold a charge for weeks and even months, this one is ""crank when you need it"" only, you'll never be able to reach for it and have instant light- at least the one I got!"
2,Good for passing time....,"Ok, this movie is supposed to be in the tradition of Ice Cubes ""Friday"" movies. Well this movie is nowhere near as good as Friday. There really is no story to this movie, however it is good for a few laughs (in some scenes). I mean for the price it's not all that bad. It is good for passing time, it all just depends on your sense of humor. This would be a good rental but you probably shouldn't buy it. Once you see it you'll realize why it never hit the theatres. The acting is horrible, but somehow it makes it more realistic (like a home video)."
1,Oh dear,"I rented this film, and what a waste of money. At first i thought it may be america humour, but looking at the review, the film is basically just the directors humour. Everything about this film is bad. I never even watched the end of the film. The acting is terrible. The film is that bad, that after 10 minutes i was skipping through the scenes to find something slightly funny, but to no avail. Why did i even rate this film? Because the director deserves it for getting this film released on DVD and video! This director would make a great salesman."
1,oh yeah & it's homophobic too...,In addition to being generally amateurish and inane and woefully unfunny this film is also very mean-spirited to gay folks too. There's a hideous 'comic' sequence where a campy gay guy is mistreated by other party-goers that the film-maker thought so hilarious it's shown all over again at the end. Most depressing.
1,What theF@#K,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. That counts student films,All of the movies on IFILM. Every movie anywhere. This thing is not even a movie it's a collection of unfunny bits With the actors standing on their marks not moving for fear of falling out of frame or stepping out of their key light if there were any key lights.(...).I hope everyone reads this and saves themselves the pain of sitting and trying to watch it."
4,Great for Administrative Staff,"Had looked for two months for a book for my staff to learn how to administer AD objects. This book covered both the history, fundamentals and how-to without digging to the level that they do not have any experience with.Would highly recommend to anyone that is starting out their AD experience by only administering objects."
2,Not for the beginner or the sleepy.,"Read the Microsoft documents, white papers and manuals on the Microsoft web site instead. This book offers no easier approach to understanding than the techno-drill available from Microsoft.Who writes these reviews anyway? I can't believe anybody really liked this book."
5,Where has this book been?,Wow!! I love this book. I'd trade all my books covering Active Directory for this book in a second. The material is covered at a level of depth that I haven't seen in any other book--and I've looked at most of them. The material is presented in a straightforward manner that doesn't put you to sleep like most MS Press books. An NT4 admin could easily read this book and become an expert at AD. I especially appreciated the chapter on AD security.
3,Taking my time to read the book,"It's a big book and it will take time to read, understand and apply it in my work environment. I am only using the book to gain knowledge for my work and if the chance came to pursue something in this area, then it will be an added bonus."
4,Great clamps for the price....,"These are your typical hand-ratchet clamps with an added feature -- the ends are reversible so it can work as a spreader if needed. They are solidly constructed, do not mark wood surfaces, and a great addition to my shop. I sometimes can't get the same force I would normally get out of a screw clamp, but for most jobs this is a great clamp."
5,Great for general Clamping (Of Large Objects),"I love this clamp, its realy great for when you just need something to be held togeather but not at an insane amout of force. It does not even compare in force to my pipe clamps, but the Quick-Grips are much quicker to put on than a pipe clamp, so I offten have clamped with the Quick-Grip first, then came back later and put on a pipe clamp."
1,Broken parts,I received the product from Crazy Dave's Tool Shed with broken parts. Emails to the seller have been ignored! I am quite unhappy about the lack of customer support. I would not buy anything from this seller again.
3,"Excellent content, but not supportive","This is a good book to have on the side, but I would begin with a more comprehensive book like ""Beginning Japanese"" by Eleanor Harz Jorden. Unlike that book, ""Teach Yourself Japanese"" causes you to constantly look up words which appeared several units ago. The illustrations are sometimes vague, and the grammatical usage is not always well explained. Having said that, the vocabulary and dialogues the author selects are interesting. They deal with topics you will want to learn, but doing so can be frustrating at times."
2,Not worth the price,"Grammars should be organised based on topics and not A to Z. Some of the entries are quite broad (more like large sections in a normal grammar), this resembling a topic/chapter. This is good, but sadly only the exception. The authors might think they had an original idea when organizing the book, but for some odd reason Japanese grammars normally have the A to Z organisation.In terms of layout this book does not seem to have had any professional help. It just looks like text straight out from the word processor. Aesthetically the book looks ugly. Search inside yourself on amazon to see what I mean. Granted, this is not the most important issue, but given the very high price of the book one could expect more.If you want a serious grammar, you'll have to accept the A to Z format. However, you don't have to accept a sloppy and ugly book. My recommendation is to go for this book (and its two more advanced companions if you want) instead:A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar."
4,MYSTERY & MURDER,"If you like old B grade movies of suspense and mystery I recommend this collection of a variety of this movie genre. Although not as spectacular with the graphics of today's action movies, the dialogue was good, sound was good, and fun to watch. This collection contained a number of detectives which I had never seen before like the mysterious Mr. Wong, a movie with Ginger Rogers in which she did not dance but was very funny as a detective, and ""Lady of Burlesque"" with Barbara Stanwyck (what a doll), and Michael Shae. ""Lady of Burlesque"" was suspenful, funny, and its worth the price of the video by itself. Good buy."
3,it's ok but worth buying,There are many movies in this set. some are stupid but there are some good ones in there also. the price is good so it is worth buying it.
4,Interesting reading,"I had read the first book several years ago, and decided to give a go at finishing all three. It took a bit of powering through, though not as much as I had remembered. It was a decent conclusion to the series that ... Well, you will just have to see for yourself."
3,Trilogy ok,Each book is too much the same. We really only need one. My recommendation is to take a break between books or you will get frustrated
5,A worthy farewell to the magnificent Coldfire Trilogy!,"Setting: Very original. The world intorduces a new form of magic and species which are very refreshing from the average fantasy epics. Plot: Slightly redundant, but it is not noticable as each book alters the plot to give a variety of different events. Characters: The main character (Daimien) is not that exciting, but a good solid personality. Tarrant, on the other hand, is a truly spectacular character full of intriuge, danger, power and mysterious thoughts. One of the best depicted personalities I have ever read about!!! Worth reading just for him!!!!! Overall: Do not rest until you have read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Great amount for the price,I like the amount I received for the price I paid but it is mild at best. I had to use more than I usually do to achieve the same flavor.
5,A Great New Approach with none of the baggage!,This book makes a healthy lifestyle easier than ever imagined. Gollman's gone out of her way to show how easy it is to eat and have fun without the trials of excess. Don't miss the chance to explore what she's spent so much time refining.
4,Very interesting tale,"of a miserly man, who instead of paying support and agreeing to divorce terms decides to have his wife killed. It is amazing how this man is finally caught after over 10 years of being a fugitive. You will not be able to put this one down."
2,White powdery mold,This was not my best purchase. I could not see any effect on my crepe myrtles. Expensive at best for a common product. I do not recommend this product.
2,Not impressive meat,"Although it tasted like crab, the product in this can is quite stringy and wet. I have not been able to make a decent crab cake or crab salad with this product and am quite disappointed. I have purchased good canned crab in the past, tho I can't remember the brand."
