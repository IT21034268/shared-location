3,No Mac compatible!,Cons:The new version of the software should be already installed.You cant install the new software without a pc (isnt it supose to be a wireless device??)No Mac compatible (!!!)No LAN port.Startup time.Pros:Price.Size.Good reception.I dropped it twice and still works ok.
2,Does not power up after initial charge,"This item arrived DOA after initial Charge. The replacement also did not start after initial charge. I was able to get it to start after removing the battery for 5 hours. Then it worked great until I powered down, then the same problem. I could not get the update software to find the device even though windows Xp found and gave it a drive designation. I thought upgrading the OS system would fix the power problem. Nokia support could not help, I was told to send the unit in for warranty repair. When it was working for the short time it was promising. Maybe just a bad batch, I think I'll order the N810 instead and cross my fingers."
2,paid more for shipping,"Was not satisifed with the quality, cute cheap earrings. I gave them to my teenage daughter. I paid more for shipping then i paid for the earrings, but i guess what you pay for; is what you get. Cheap."
5,thrilling-suspenseful,Fear was a suspenseful movie that kept you awake through the whole thing!You couldn't leave to get a snack or go to the bathroom for one moment or you would be missing out.Mark Wahlberg was his normal sexy self!Reece Witherspoon was hot to all the guys and was very attractive!You can't miss out on an opportunity of Fear
4,SOLID THRILLER WITH A VERY GOOD CAST!,"This is a little known film from the early 90's. The movie takes it's time to flesh out the characters and to build some tension, but when it lets loose, it delivers! Mark Wahlberg gives a very chilling performance as a class 'A' nut job in this above average thriller. It smells like TV, but it's much better than that. Reese Witherspoon and the rest of the cast are very good as well. I rate it 3 1/2 stars."
2,Not the Fear I was looking for,"There are two movies, one called ""The Fear"" in 1994 and one that is just ""Fear"" which starred Mark Wahlberg in 1996. I would like the 1996 Fear soundtrack. You have ""The Fear"" soundtrack listed under both movies. The Fear soundtrack I purchased was definitely not the music I heard in the 1996 Mark Wahlberg film."
4,Fear is a classic!,"Hey,I can't exactly remember when i first saw this movie! Could of been with friends who knows! but its one of my favorite ""thrillers""! To start things Mark Wahlberg plays David(and the appeal to most is Mark is very good looking especially in this movie)- I don't want to give away this movie but basically he meets Nicole(Reese Witherspoon) and things don't turn out the way Nicole plans.. The reason why i enjoyed this movie so much and had to buy it was because of how suspenceful it gets! It actually has somewhat of a plot unlike many other ""teen"" thriller movies.. so i recommend you check this movie out:) you won't be dissapointed!"
1,TERRIBLE PIECE OF EXPLOITATIVE GARBAGE!,"""Fear"" is probably the movie I hate most in all the world. Every girl I know seems to have the wrong idea about sexuality and love because of this movie. The movie focuses too much on extremes-- perfect sex/love and then horrible abuse/murder. Life is not like that. At least Fatal Attraction (and even Swimfan) make movies that have a point. Save your money and rent Fatal Attraction."
1,Worst movie ever.,"Some movies are so bad they're good. This isn't one of them. This movie was the kind terrible that I wish I could undergo selective electroshock therapy to erase any knowledge of its existence. I like all the stars in the movie, but now this movie is going to taint the experience when I see them in future movies.For a movie that faithfully follows a time-tested formula, it manages to tweak everything just wrong. The creepy psycho homicidal maniac isn't an interesting kind of creep. While you obviously hope he gets what's coming to him, waiting until the end of the movie is far too long. And what sort of accent or dialect is that supposed to be?I wish I would have stopped watching before the family dog was beheaded. I wish I had never seen it. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Especially if you like Reese Witherspoon--a wonderful actress in the right role--you will wish you hadn't seen her in this dreck."
4,"suprisingly intense and creepy, Wahlberg is off the wall","Wahlberg goes all the way in this one and thats what makes this movie so intense and creepy, hes so creepy. He's Reese Witherspoons new boyfriend David and he seems a little off put, well maybe thats because hes a total psycho. William Petersen is Witherspoons dad, Amy Breneman is Witherspoons step-mom and Alyssa Milano is Witherspoons friend. some intense moments include where Wahlberg follows the kid and snaps his neck, that looked so real and where him and his friends invade Witherspoons house at the end and kill her dog. some parts may be sdisturbing for parents. the climactic battle at the end with Petersen and Wahlberg is intense also as Petersen throws Wahlberg out the window and he hits the rocks below"
5,"The most moving movie, with SEX, HORROR...and more SEX~!",Mark Whalberg looks sooo hot!! The movie is incrediable and it scared the crap out of me...yet I wished I was in Reese Witherspoons place...lol...It was great!
3,Disturbing and real,"Although this isn't a horror movie, it's fairly scary just because it can be so real at times. For anyone who has been through verbal or physical violence in a relationship, this movie might be a bit much to handle.Nicole (Reese Witherspoon)is a 16 year old girl who, like most teenage girls, likes to have fun. When she and her best friend Margo go out to a party one night, Nicole meets the handsome and mysterious David (Mark Wahlberg). Soon, she starts spending a lot of time with David. However, after a couple of weeks, Nicole realizes that David is becoming extremely possessive and jealous whenever. David even goes to the extreme by beating up one of Nicole's male friends because he's seen walking Nicole home. When Nicole ends the relationship with David, he tries everything to try and get her back but when that doesn't work, he begins to take things too far."
2,sexy...,"If you are renting this movie to show to teens, don't forget there is a super sexy roller coaster scene. It's a good movie about phsycho teen dating, but there is definitley a sexy scene."
3,good movie,"this is a very good movie, but i only gave it 3 stars because this version is the letterbox version and doesnt even cover half the tv screen. I dont mind the 16x9 ones but loathe the letterbox dvds the movie itself has an excellent story and is well worth watching."
5,Fear,"From the boy next door to every girls worst nightmare in a heart beat. A thriller that lets you love and hate the same character at the same time. Twists and turns keep your eyes glued to the television and Mark Walbergs gentle stare keeps you loving a psychotic. The ending keeps those who enjoyed the movie hoping for more. An ending scene with police divers keeps those who noticed it wondering, was he alive or was he dead? Just who's body were they looking for?"
1,Reese was just an idiot...,"in this movie, she acted so dumb, and her father was really getting on my nerves. Alyssa Milano really took the cake, playing the friend who sleeps with her friends man. The ending was the worst part of this movie, I found myself being able to predict what was going to happen (she only gave him the alarm code when he snuck in to sleep with her)....the only person who had any sense in this movie was the little brother...."
1,Incredibly stupid,"Possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. Reese Witherspoon is a beautiful and talented actress but this movie doesn't give us any evidence of that. Horrible acting, horrible writing... in fact, just about everything in this movie is horrible."
1,Terrible Service,"I am completely annoyed with this company. I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one. Instead of just sending me the right one, they are making me go through this ridiculous process by sending the other one back before they send the right one even though it was their mistake. It was supposre to be a christmas gift and basically it was ruined."
3,Poor Quality,"I thought the movie was entertaining, but the last scene was unrealistic and pathetic. I watched it mostly because Mark was so sexy and young. Anyway, the video streamed pretty easily but was really poor quality. I could of got better quality without paying anything on say youtube or something."
5,The movie FEAR (1996),"This movie features Mark Walberg, aka Marky Mark, and Reese Witherspoon. Young Reese meets the guy of her dreams. Little did she know everything isn't always what they seem. So her and Mark, become boyfriend/girlfriend. And if i'm not mistaken, end up having sex.. (I haven't seen it in a while so I might be mistaken this part of Fear with Mother May I Sleep With Danger (always a movie worth watching).) Anyway, then Reese notices something wrong with Mark. So she dumps him, like in all movies like this. Despicably, he becomes obessed with Reese, (which by the way works very well with Mark, hot, sexy Mark obessed). Anyways, then he trys to kill her and her family.. You know, the usual. But if I had to rate this 1 to 100, it'd definatly be a 100. So by any chance, check out this movie. You can buy it on Amazon.com either new or used, although new costs more, to me Marky Mark is sooooooooooooo worth it."
3,Good Entertainment,Mark Wahlberg does a great job at being a pshycopath in this movie. This is a good movie if you are looking to watch something that will kill time. It's a cool movie to add to your movie collection. Love Reese Witherspoon.
2,Wonders of Alaska,Beautiful scenery and certainly a topic of our interest. Tourist vacation souvenir aptly describes this DVD. The narration fails a professional standard; text clearly read with occasional lapses of grammar with a voice sounding much like a teenager rather than one of a well-modulated professional. The package of picture and narration disappoints although the pictures are interesting. At the end of the DVD my guests were more happy that it was over than excited by the act of having seen something beautiful. A bit amateurish was one comment I received.
2,Look for better DVDs on Alaska,"Most of the reviews of this DVD are positive so all I can say is buy with care. The quality of the images is only fair, though the subject matter is wonderful. There is much repetition, particularly in the humped back whale section. The narrator sounds like he/she is reading from a prepared script without much preparation. As one reviewer put it - ""it sounds amateurish"". You may want to look at DVDs made by the National Geographic Society or Alaska Geographic as well as others available from Amazon."
3,Not the Best,"Great videos! But was unhappy with the narration. It was aimed at a grade school level, which would be good if purchased for that age level, but I'm 65! Will probably donate."
2,"Agree with URS ""Little bear""","Everything Little bear wrote reflect my reaction to this video. I couldn't have said it any better. Waste of time and money. I would return it, but since I would only get half my money back, I will keep it for my 8-12 year old grandchildren as it is at their level of intelligence."
5,Breathtaking scenery,"""The Wonders of Alaska"" DVD makes you feel like you've actually taken an Alaskan cruise around this vast state and its beautiful nature scenery. Where else can you see whales and bears in their natural environments, massive glaciers and vast wilderness? The DVD is exciting, with beautiful footage, interesting content and great narration. I highly recommend this DVD to all nature lovers wanting to experience the wonders of Alaska."
2,The Wonders of Alaska,To me this is a waste of time more on the level for kids and I would not recommend this DVD!!!
4,Wonderful Alaska,"This is a great movie. It has some of the most beautiful footage or glaciers,nature, wild bears and whales. It is actually really exciting and contains very interesting content. It is fun to follow along to great narration of a land I have never visited. This is the perfect Alaska DVD."
5,Literally WONDERFUL!,I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. Alaska's natural beauty is breathtaking and the footage is beautiful. You get to see all kinds of amazing wildlife like bears and whales as well as stunning landscapes. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who loves nature!
4,Wondering about Alaska?,"The wonders of Alaska DVD is a venture inside the beautiful state of Alaska. The beautiful glaciers, wild animals, and unique culture are treat to watch. My favorite part of the DVD would be the great narration and the wild animals such as bears, whales and moose. I highly recommend purchasing this DVD. The interesting content and beautiful footage are both educational and interesting."
5,Strero & Music Lover,"I have been around Altec Lansing and JBL monitor speakers, stereo and music my entire life. I have been fortunate enough to spent lots of time in very close relationships with both stereophiles and several high end stereo salespeople. I have been exposed to lots of various equipment. These JBL L890CH speakers are extremely high quality reference/monitor speakers. I mated them with an affordable Harman Kardon 3490 and also a JBL wireless subwoofer, and the system sounds great. When I recover from these expenses, I plan to upgrade to a Krell or Merantz amp. You can easily spend more on other speakers that do not sound as good. The speakers not only sound fantastic and are great building blocks, they look beautiful in my living room as well. Rock n' Roll"
5,wow,originally had these towers majorly underpowered and enjoyed them even than now that i'm actually feeding them enough power the beast within has arised in a good way woofers would flop around like crazy underpowered but give them the power they need and they tighten up running them on a onkyo 5008 receiver in btl mode had them turned up as loud as my ears could take and not even a nuance of distortion
1,WORST SPEAKERS EVER MADE,"I Very disappointed whith this speakers I blowup all croosover, tweeters,do yourself a favor DON'T SPENT A DIME ON THIS CRAP, LOOK FOR A GOOD PAIR YAMAHA NS-1000M AND YOULL BE HAPPY FOREVER"
5,Excellent Course book,"Since I am taking an advance statistics course this semester, this book was recommended by the instructor.It is an excellent stats book. Very easy to read.One very good aspect of the book is that single example is used and analysed using different methods. Thus you don't have to look into the example again and again to know the data. By the time you are half way through the chapter, you already know the data.Highly recommended"
5,Timbalada speaks to your soul,"This music gets inside you, in a happy, energetic way. It's the perfect music for a sunny afternoon, and it's made for moving your body and feeling like you are part of this beautiful planet."
1,Not worth the money,"My wife tried this product and hated it. It smelled terrible, and did not work. Would never buy it again. Way too much money for something that didn't work."
4,a ew indie discovery,"Ok, I've had a copy of this album since May of 2001, and I haven't stoppedwaiting for a new release by Kevin Devine. It's not the most polished album on the market, but that's part of the point. The vocals are exposed and usually accompanied by nothing but a single acoustic guitar. This one is for fans of early Elliott Smith. The music (i.e., guitar) is more simplistic than Smith's for the most part, but once again, that's not bad...just different. I can see Kevin Devine becoming qutie popular on the indie scene after a couple more releases, and I look forward to watching him progress as an artist. If you're one of those indie rockers who likes to get in on an artist before he/she is big, this is one to watch."
4,"A great and different style of followup to ""Flood""","I, for one, couldn't wait to crack open this book after reading ""Flood"". There are some very dark moments throughout this story, but I felt some optimisim from Baxter on this one. The ending certainly leaves room for more books. Baxter has already spun a couple novella sequels out in Asmiov's Science Fiction Magazine (Earth II & Earth III). I sincerely hope he continues to write stories in this universe."
3,implausable,"Great theme for this book, building and launching a star ship and Baxter goes out of his way to describe a possible 'star drive', but the scope of the theme ended up being too much of a reach for the author. Seriously folks, building and launching a starship when all that remains of your former nation is a soon to be overwhelmed archipeligo formed by the Rocky Mountains and just where does a country full of people go?The book did pose some interesting questions, how do you keep people sane for such a period of time as this sort of travel will take and what happens when you get there and it isn't quite right for colonization?"
2,Disappointing to say the least.,I am not sure if the 5 star reviewers and I read the same book. I will not go into a lengthy and detailed synopsis of this book. You can read that in other reviews and I feel like I have spent enough of my time on this novel. The premise of this book was very interesting but the character development was non-existent. I was not invested in ANYONE and most of the characters were one-dimensional and the epitome of cliché. I did enjoy his writing style however and you can tell that he did a lot of research to get the science right. I just wish that the ending were better or maybe more fulfilling. I do not think that I will be reading any more of his novels.
3,Good read,It wasn't bad but not for everybody personal I love this kind of book. I wish I could give half stars it didn't quiet earn 3 just 2 1/2 in my mind but it was a good read. I was constantly wondering what was going to happen next. Mostly this book made me want to play the game Star Ocean: The Last Hope so bad it wasn't funny. My final thoughts is if your looking for a good sifi read that is in space go for it. Happy reading
4,One of Baxter's darker themed works,"I really enjoyed this novel having read most of Baxter's other works including ""Flood"". As other reviewers have mentioned, you just have to except the plot device that we could actually develop a faster-than-light starship within the next generation. Much like ""Flood"", this is a very dark story following people living out their entire lives in the most dismal of situations. Like his novel, ""Titan"", Baxter portrays space travel as a very miserable and uncertain endeavor. It's not a complete downer, however, with an overriding theme that human ingenuity can conquer all, albeit a little implausibly sometimes. The novel leaves open room for at least 3 sequels following the continuing stories left open in this universe."
1,"Unfocused, overly long, and dull","I read and enjoyed ""Flood"" and purchased this sequel with high hopes. However, where ""Flood"" was a page-turner, ""Ark"" was a long slog through deep mud.The story branches out into a number of substories that are more filler than anything else, and have nothing to do with the main storylines. I admit that I skimmed the second half of the book, and I'm glad that I did. The payoff was absolutely not worth it.Read and enjoy ""Flood"" (which despite what some reviewers have written, has nothing to do with global climate change), but I suggest avoiding this unnecessary sequel."
5,"A captivating, moving story no library should be without","ARK provides a fine, satisfying sequel to the flood-of-the-world novel FLOOD from 2009, this set in the year 2041 when the oceans are covering the earth. A chosen few have their sights set on fleeing the planet - and Holle's entire life has been one of training for this event. ARK is a captivating, moving story no library should be without!"
3,White Hemp Rainbows,"Great vintage appeal and style! Clean look in the store and while new, easy fit and molded quickly to feet. For obvious reasons the lighter style absorbed oil and sweat quickly and I found myself researching ways to keep them clean. The best suggestion I was able to find, was to run an empty dishwasher cycle, placing the sandals on the top rack to clean them. Aside from that, the shoe was durable and a good flop (especially for the weekend beach trips).Rainbows are the best sandals, lifetime warrantied and stylish. My biggest recommendation is purchase the darker versions of this style."
3,Why Mono?,This LP was originally recorded in stereo. The reverbs become very hollow when collapsed to mono. Though crisp and bright the mono version comes off thick and artificial.The music is still awesome.
4,An econ book with real world uses!,"Daniels and VanHoose have put together an easy to read, real world applicable textbook. The topics covered are upper level collegiate international finance, but it's presented in a down to earth, orderly fashion. While I would have wanted color graphs, the full examples of complex operations (derivatives hedging, theoretical currency exchange rates and the like) more than made up the difference. They separate the elitist mathematics from that which students want and need. As a college student without a lot of time, that's a huge help. The most important teaching tool used extensively throughout the book is historical data. Being able to show why in theory, give evidence, and then present the deviations takes effort. There is no easy way to explain how the central banks around the world use different tactics in thier policies, but they got through it."
5,excellent,"this is an excellent book. period. the other guy who gave it a low rating, i challenge him to find a better book on this subject"
3,"unorganised, simplistic, full of errors","This text is definately not an 'upper level' text. It is poorly organized, essential theoretical information is left out, there are abundant, unexcusable errors, and the middle third of the book is essentially a waste of paper.The text starts off rather well, but the decision to move to derivatives, etc at the point they do and then back to a general reading on international organizations and then back again to more mathematical models is a bit odd.The information on different world events and world institutions, primarily in the middle third of the book, is written to an audience that could easily be a principles macro class.There are better books out there."
4,Capitalism critcism,"In this book Dostoevsky seems to take his time to criticize capitalism ( or so I find), takes as an example French society,criticizes the accumulation of money and the adulation of god money (Baal), the servilism that comes with it, analyzes the way marital relations are, that is in relation with capitalism (Bribri and Ma biche ).I found it pretty good, although it requires you to have knowledge of many things of the time it was written, (for instance can you remember who is Guizot?) and be used to the style of Dostoevsky."
4,Junkyard treasures and Jupiter Jones,"""Mystery of the Screaming Clock"" was one of my very favorite Three Investigators books. The tale begins when Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews find a clock that ""screams"" mysteriously. As they try to discover why anyone would construct such a device, the mystery unfolds and their clues lead them to wild new places! Of course, I would never disclose the ending, but let me tell you, it's a shocker!"
5,With God in Russia,"This is very easy reading; but very detailed and an interesting true story. It is about a priest, but it isn't necessary to be Catholic to enjoy the story of the lives of people exiled to Siberia. It made me stop and wonder if I could have been strong enough to endure that which others have endured!Regrettfully, Father Walter Ciszek has gone on to his eternal reward. Wish I could have met him and heard the story from his lips.Very interesting!!!!!"
3,It's okay,I read this as my husband told me he really liked it. He probably would have given it 5 stars. I guess it wasn't what I expected.
5,Great witness to the power of God's providence,This book really shows how faith gives meaning ti life even in the most exteme circumstances. Fr Ciszek humbly tells his story of how his trust in God's providence brought him through terrible experiences so that he could witness to God in a land ruled by an atheistic government. As Fr Ciszek admits - this is just the story. It should be read together with his other book 'He leadeth me' to understand more fully Fr Ciszek's faith.
3,"Good book, but his other book is better","This is a good book, however I like his second book ""He Leadeth Me"" better. In this book, Father Ciszek does not go into much detail about what he learned from his ordeal. He mostly gives a chronology of all the events that took place during his 23 years in Russian work camps and prison camps.In his other book ""He Leadeth Me"", he goes into detail all the spiritual lessons that he learned during his difficult years of imprisonment in Russia. His spiritual insights are very edifying and enlightening. He provides alot of hard earned spiritual lessons and spiritual direction in his other book ""He Leadeth Me"".So, while I would recommend this book, in my opinion it is not as good as his other book.Glenn Dallaire"
3,I wanted to like it more,"This book was really just so-so for me. As you already know, it tells of his 20+ years in various Soviet prisons and labor camps. I wanted to read this due to his being a priest and to experience it from that perspective, but he only touched on that, relative to simply telling what happened in a matter of fact type of narrative. While touching on his life as a priest he really doesn't extrapolate much on the spiritual nature -- he leaves that to his much betterHe Leadeth Me, which I do recommend. Since that is the case, you are left simply with a narrative of what he went through over those years, and that is why was just OK for me. After readingOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,The Gulag Archipelago Volume 1: An Experiment in Literary Investigation (P.S.), and evenMemoirs from the House of the Dead (Oxford World's Classics), the tales told, as crazy and terrible as they were, start to run together."
3,"Great markers, but one missing!","The reason I gave a lower rating was NOT because of the marker quality. I love prismacolor markers, they're not copics, but they do justice with a great color variety, blending, and more importantly, price.But when buying this product, I would tell people to make sure they count them to make sure they're all there! I thought maybe it was just me, but after putting them all in order I noticed I was missing PM-25, Spring green. I asked Amazon's service if they could just send me the missing marker, but apparently all they could do was give me a refund. I decided against the refund because I still got 71 out of the 72 and I only paid half the price due to Christmas (thank you gift cards).Eitherway, great product, fast shipping, just make sure you count them accordingly, because you might miss one without noticing it (72 markers are quite a handful afterall)."
4,nice set of markers,"these are by far the nicest set of markers made, great for any artist as long as their responsable because they are very expensive"
4,Prismacolor Premier Double Ended Art Markers,I give it 4 stars because they do what they are suppose to do and the quality of the markers is there! There is just not enough colors.
1,The packaging was nicer than the product.,"When I ordered this locket, I expected to receive a beautiful, antique-looking locket, that looked the same in the picture as it did in my hand. I was extremely disappointed. The locket itself is made of cheap, thin metal. The ""antique"" effect is just black paint in the creases. It appears as if the locket was dipped in motor oil, but not thoroughly cleaned. The chain is almost as bad. It is very bulky, much larger than it looks in the picture. AND the chain broke seconds after I got it out of the package (although the package was quite nice). To prospective buyers, don't waste your money. This necklace belongs in the garbage can, end of story."
5,The Best Satire Ever Written on Academia,"It's the best satire ever written on academia. I was loving it, guys. LOVING it. Every word."
5,The Songs James Taylor Wishes He'd Written,"I found this CD for $1.99 in a discount rack two years ago in Palo Alto, and I bought it on a lark, something I almost never do. Out of the thousands of CD's I own, this may be my favorite. I keep searching for used copies, which I purchase for my friends and family members.Arudel's soaring melodies, coupled with the sincerity and warmth of his voice, command attention throughout his collection of nostalgic narratives. It's impossible to pick a favorite tune, as each is soulful, hook-laden, and the product of impeccable craftsmanship.I wish I could thank Arundel personally for the pleasure he's given me with this recording."
5,thomas sheriden,i am a student of class nine and am parpticpating in the class elocution.please give me some current topics which will help me to compete the same. thanking you.
1,Beware!!! False claim on Amazon website,"I bought this DVD for my sons who speaks French, because it says so on the Language description, but its not true. Amazon please fix!!!!!!"
5,Great,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and later in life wished I owned it, I finally found it and it's as good as I remember. This movie is great and I'm sure it will be just as memorable to youngsters as it was to me when I saw it all those years ago. This is the kind of thing younger kids should be watching because it is Great and not inappropriate for the younger ages."
5,Great film for kids,I remember watching this movie as a kid and I loved it then and I still love it now. I think that it deals with a lot of themes that are appropriate for all ages. It is also good for adults too because it is entertaining. I love the older version of the series as well.Definitely would recommend this movie for everyone
3,Some fun in the wild west...,I really bought the movie because Liev Schreiber was in it. But it turned out to be sort of fun. Good for a Friday night at home.
3,Buffalo Girls,I always thought this was a good movie and I had it on VHS. The only problem is it is not closed captioned and I have a hearing problem
3,Mostly Boring,"I bought this because of Anjelica Huston. Some of her scenes are kind of funny, but that's about the only good thing about this movie. It's long and boring and I can't stand Melanie Griffiths."
3,Surprised,This movie was okay. it seemed to move very slow and some scenes could have been left out. the 2 best scenes in the movie were the one wherethe Indian saw the whales in the ocean and the scene with Annie Oakley.and that was because of Reba Mcentire. She was wonderful as Annie Oakley.overall the movie was okay. But it wasn't impressive.
2,IT WASN'T THAT GOOD...,"I wouldn't reccomend this movie. It didn't follow the book by Larry McMurtry whatsoever. If you're curious about this title, read the book. The book is better. It was more true the Calamity Jane's life... she didn't even have a daughter named Janey... she just wished she had. Wild Bill Hickok never said a word to her, unless it was bussiness. At the end of the book Calamity said.. ""I just get drunk a lot and make up stories about how I wanted it to go, and thats how it sticks in my mind. Wild Bill Hickok never once looked at me in interest."" Thats why I didn't paticualary care for Buffalo girls te movie... don't waste your time on the movie... READ THE BOOK!!"
1,Buffalo Girls,"The original version of this movie was great. Huston is superb as Calamity Jane, and Melanie Griffith is a great madame.But this version has been hacked to death by some uncaring editor. It has lost it's continuity and is very dissappointing."
3,Flying stories on the way to Asia.,"I am going to disagree with my fellow reviewers. This was an OK read. I think Anne Lindbergh was a good writer, but whether a book survives the test of time is the question. I am not sure this book does. Mrs. Lindbergh is philosophical at times in her travels from Washington to Canada to Alaska to Russia and thence to Japan and China. The book is very readable about her interactions with people along the way. It does not give much insight on her husband.This is an OK read on the early age of airplane travel. I found some interesting stories in this book. However it does not give much info on her or her famous husband."
5,Contains almost everything you need to know about discus,"This book contains almost every piece of information needed to keep and breed discus. It is usefull for the beginner as well as for the more experienced. Although the title indicate it's only about wild caught discus, it is useful for the purpose of keeping captive breed discus as well. Lots of beautiful pictures."
3,"full of fascinate pictures, but lack of disease remedy.",I was finding more professional books about discus raising and curing. This book provides much of good knowledge about wild discus. But it has small amount of disease preventing method.
1,Didn't work!,"Live in Denver, CO area. Signal wasn't strong enough to broadcast anything in one car. The other car it came through but had so much static it was unlistenable. Returned it in a heartbeat."
2,iLuv I707BLK iPod FM Transmitter,"This is a neat device and works quite well. DO NOT BUY ONE FOR AN 8GIG 5th GENERATION iPod. YOU WILL HAVE TO EXTENSIVELY MODIFY IT TO FIT. Well, Mrs. Lincoln, other than the shooting, how was the play? Also, iLuv is snotty about it not fitting. It took hours to cut the slot bigger, knock off the two tabs, then measure and epoxy the holder to the unit in the proper position. iLuv could easily make an inexpensive adapter! It works fine now, however.UPDATE: This device does NOT seem to charge my iPod when it is plugged in to it AND if you leave the iPod in the device in also seems to DISCHARGE the iPod."
4,Great Product for the $$$,"This is the first FM transmitter I've used, and while it's not the greatest with respect to volume, it's good enough to use in my AUX-lacking car with my iPod Nano. I didn't find great reviews on any of them and this one is much less expensive than many. I use it all the time and I think it's a good value for the money."
2,Better for newer iPod,"I have a the 2nd generation iPod and it doesn't fit well for those. The older iPods are much smaller so it didn't stay in the connection. Whenever I hit a bump in the road, the iPod would come loose and I would have to hold it to hear my music."
1,The old one was better...,"I originally bought the iLuv transmitter over others because the transmitter ran off the iPod's battery and wasn't solely reliant on the car's electrical system to be used. Since my car currently has an issue with the electrical system (the lighter/plugs don't work) I pretty much wasted my money buying this new version since it cannot be powered off the iPod itself. I don't know why iLuv changed what I considered a unique and useful part of their product to be just like everyone else, but I am thoroughly disappointed to have wasted 34 bucks on it."
2,Died,I had this for my iPhone for about a year. It died about 4 months ago. Needless to say I don't understand why it doesn't work anymore but there's no way I'm buying another one.
3,Too Much Static,"Although it plays the music on my ipod, there is alot of static and my ipod is not secure in the holster. Even after adding the ipod adapter in the back."
1,Not what I thought it was.,"When I received the product I noticed on the package it said for iphone 3 and 3S and ipod touch. No where does it mention this in the description. It's probably good for the older models of iphones that it fits (do they sell them anymore?), but seemed a bit overpriced for fitting 3 and 3S models which are very outdated.They should state the models that it is for."
3,Loses signal on long drives,"While this pretty much did what I needed, the old FM interference was a problem on my cross country drive. As the only person in the car, I would have to turn off my phone, from which I was listening to Audible books, or miss parts of the story."
1,I hate the iluv,". Having read other reviews of the iluv, I figured, under $40, it's worth a try. It does work but the sound quality is terrible. My advice is, buy a hardwired adapter kit or wait until you have a car with the capability to directly plug in an ipod or other mp3 player."
3,FM xmtr,I use the FM xmtr in a delivery van. There is some static most of the time and I have to change the station it transmits to often. It is much better than just having the fm radio. I am glad I bought it but a perfectionist may not be happy.
3,fm transimitter OK,I think spending a bit more money would have been a good idea; go up to the next level and see if the overall quality isn't better.
4,Very NIce,I am very pleased with this product. Some times there is a bit of static but I only notice it in between songs. It's great to be able to take my ipod in the car with me.
3,Not bad for the price.,"This transmitter works very well for my iPod Video with very little static through the radio. However, the volume is very low as compared with my cassette. I use this to keep my iPod charged in the car but still use the cassette with it so I can jam out. Overall it is a excellent product, but if your looking for sound quality, this won't cut it."
1,total piece of junk,"I purchased this item for my daughters birthday. Unfortunately, it does not work. Actually it does function for producing white noise. It would not connect and broadcast her ipod touch at all. It did, for some reason, broadcast my ipod nano, however, it only worked when I had my hand over it. Otherwise, major static. There may be many reasons why it worked so poorly. Some may not even be as a result of the product itself. Each car is going to be different for sure but the performance was so poor I can't imagine it being acceptable at any point. Yet, several people gave this a very good rating... Hmmm... Anyway, buyer beware... and thank goodness for free returns !!"
1,dissappointing,"This product appears to be a great idea and a simple solution for using my ipod in the car. It was simple to set up and use. The sound quality is pretty good too. However, after use for a week or so, the unit has failed, requiring the replacement of the fuse three times so far."
1,Dont Buy!!!,"I bought this product when I first got my iphone and it has so many issues, phone doesnt fit properly in this. Im afraid that phone may fell down or the battery connector inside phone may get spoiled as the phone bends. I stopped using this after 1 week."
2,"good sound, poor quality","I was excited about purchasing it since the sound is really good. However,it was broken after 2 days... really disappointed!"
4,Secrets of a Catholic Church,"A unique explanation of Roman Catholic doctrine and beliefs. Written by a former Catholic Priest the book is based on fact presented in a noncontroversial form.The Chapters are divided in first in brief analysis of the Catholic Doctrine then an analysis and refutation with references from authorized St. Anthony Guild & Douay Versions.It's presents the facts proving Roman Catholic doctrine and practices are not Christian, but actually derived from pagan traditions and practices only using the essence of Christianity to deceive the masses.The book lists Catholic practices with dates of institution, Scripture references and detailed index.Great book for Christian Apologetics"
4,Very Pleased,I have very pleased with the baby spring float. It is the safest baby float I have found. It will not tip over like some floats. Also my baby loves it!! She likes to sit in it. I have tried several others and this is the only one she will sit in. I highly recommend this float.
5,good purchase,We have gotten a lot of use from this floatie. We will pass it on to a friend when our son grows too big for it.
5,"Nice, Simple Float","Our 15 mos old seemed to enjoy floating around. I could see how some little ones would be able to free themselves as some reviewers mentioned, but so far, we have not had a problem. Our daughter liked splashing and even tried to blow bubbles while seated in her toy. It's nice how she can be ""in"" the water."
5,Love It!!,"We put our son in this as soon as he could hold his head up. He loved to be in it, and loves the water. I've recommended it to several people."
5,Still going strong after 3 years!,"We bought two of these 3 years ago. While other floaties have come and gone, these have stood the test of time, going through 3 children! We have never had to patch these floats, they fold into a nice small circle, and it's super quick to inflate them. Our second child was the only one who ever figured out how to climb out, but we were never out of arm's reach, so this didn't bother me. Our youngest is 2 this Summer and she loves this float. When she is not dead set on trying to swim, she kicks her feet and makes herself bob like a cork and it just makes her sooo happy. I would definitely recommend these. For the price, you're getting a SUPERB product that will last more than a single Summer. If we lost ours tomorrow, I wouldn't hesitate to replace it! Hands down, this is the perfect float!"
4,Nice pool float...,We just went to the beach with our son and bought this at Wal-greens for the same price. I had read the reviews on here and decided that I wanted to try it. Our son is almost 7 months old so I can not say how it would do for a younger baby. The age range listed does not recommend it for a younger baby either. Our son enjoyed this float and it was nice to be able to hold onto it and float with him. It does put the baby more into the water than the typical inflatable baby float so you want to pay close attention to your baby of course. Keep in mind what other reviewers have said about the baby's ability to lean forward in this float. My son was able to get his face into the water at times but this float is recommended for an older baby and would give you the ability to get several months of use out of it.
5,My son loves it!,"My husband and I went looking for a good baby float and came across this one, we immediately chose it because we both love our adult spring floats. Yes it is true they can put their face in the water but as long as you are there its not a big deal, I mean how else are they going to learn how to hold their breath? I love it and will definitly be using it next year for my son who is 9 months right now!"
4,Best Floating Ring I've Seen,This is great for babies and toddlers in a deeper pool. Keeps them stable in the water and gives them some independence to play/move on their own.
4,Great way to be 'independent' in the pool!,"My son didn't really like this at first, but after a couple of times using it, he really seemed to enjoy being ""on his own"" in the water. We stayed close at all times, but we didn't have to hang onto him while he tried to wiggle around, which made it for for everyone to be in the pool. He actually almost fell asleep in it twice!"
4,Great for babies,Blow it up and put your child inside. We have had one for both of our daughters and they help get the baby engaged in the pool experience. Helps them adjust and lose their fear. Also gives the parents a chance to swim.
3,Good Float but a little dangerous for little ones,I love the fact it keeps my daughter down in the water more than any other float but she can stick her face in the water surrounding her. She is very daring in the pool. Yesterday she dunked her head in the water surrounding the float at least 3-4 times and I had to pull her out and make sure she was okay. You have to be very careful with it.
4,Great Float,"I bought this float for my 1 year old, but knew my 2 1/2 year would want to use it too. This float is perfect for both. I like that the child can reach the water to splash without having to lean over the float. Older kids at our pool also played with it, and it supported them when laying on it, or floating with it. Would recommend this float to anybody with kids 8 mo.'s and up. Wish I would have bought this before I bought all the plastic ones!"
1,This Product Needs to Be Recalled!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this for my 8 month old, and she almost drowned because she can put her face in the water face down very easily with me being right there!!!The mesh fills with water and it is not safe. She could have also crawled out of it if she wanted to. I know on the product it does give that warning. Please do not buy this product!!! It is very dangerous. I have notified the manufacturer of my worries and concerns, so hopefully they can make it safer for us moms."
1,"Not stable, child climbed out and nearly flipped",My daughter was under 1 year at the time and was able to climb out and nearly flipped. We returned it.
4,Read the manufacturers recom age!!!,According to the manufacturer this toy is for 6 YEARS and up! Fun for OLDER kids!
5,Much better than others,"I tried a blow up plastic boat type float for my baby, but he was always having to reach way over the side to splash into the water, causing him to tip. This float is nice because of the mesh around the seat, which allows the baby to splash without having to reach. Because it is wide, it is very stable."
5,Safe way to explore water,"This is a great floatation device that allows baby to explore water without tipping over. The mesh seperating the tubes is an ideal location for babies toys. Love it!!!Also, helpful to know that I use it on my 8 month old son."
3,Air Pump Needed,I must have received a defective one. I thought I was going to bust a lung to inflate this one. I had to get an air pump to inflate air on this flotation device. It's foldable so it would have been nice for travel.
2,Prada Quilted bag,Bag is very pretty and functional - the only thing is the leather on the handle has seperated and does not look nice - especially when this is a designer bag it almost makes it seem not real - A Prada bag should not do this.
5,An Eye Opener to Many Truths and Unbounded Wisdom,"I have shared this book with many friends in the Spiritualist community and we all believe this book contains so much truth and wisdom for the reader to ponder and to follow. The first time I read the book I was glued to every page and after each chapter sat and was awed at Dan Millman's ability to convey with so much ease the wisdom of natural law through the voice of a Sage. It has inspired many of my friends, so much that I have bought the book and given it to them as gifts.It is a must read book for all that will help in all aspects of life."
5,This is it,"Well written, concise, appropriate. I found this book among the most valuable I own. This truly is everything that needs to be said. Well done - worth your time."
2,nexdt time I'll go to the store,The product works well...but the shipping & handling nearly doubled the cost. If I had just gone to the store...
3,Great music,"The case was broken (possibly in transit?), but luckily the CD was undamaged and (as expected) the music is Awesome!"
1,product never worked. manufacturer does not stand behind their product.,"This product ruined at least 3 brand new batteries. Amazon refuses to do anything about it and the manufacturer will not stand behind their product. I will never use amazon or a schumacher product again. If the product is ""as is"" I may as well buy it used for a fraction of the cost."
2,heavy & noisy,"I bought this to replace a dead Schumacher charger I was using on my sailboat, and returned it because of the loud humming noise it makes. This unit also very heavy, clunky, and produces much heat. I purchased instead a Guest smart charger which has worked flawlessly for over two years now."
3,Good -- but could have been great,"This is a perfect example of editorial intrusion. It's based on the diary of the editor's great-grandfather, a member of the high-casualty 11th Mississippi. But the editor has fictionalized it. It's impossible to tell what was originally there and what has been added, and of course all the authenticity of the authorial ""voice"" has been lost. Does Wilkins' diary really contain one of the best first-person accounts of Pickett's Charge out there, or has Ellis made that part up? I'd love to see an edition of Wilkins' diary permitting him to speak in his own voice. The tiny quote in the introduction only serves to tease. As it is, this book is an interesting, but frustrating, portrayal."
2,Cute kids book,"Although the layout and drawing skills of the artist are sub-par, this book will amuse your children (although it's for 6 and under). What it lacks in imagination, it makes up for in a childs interest in monsters. Cute for a quick read, but not one for the library."
5,Thrilling & Profound - Eye-opener to the Nuclear Threat,"What lies ahead? This book was a spine-chilling account of what can go on within the White House and our trading partners overseas. Fictional and factional. I liked the pace, the adventure and the suspense throughout. The high-tech segments added an extra ingredient--cyberwar--how the Internet can be used against us. Now, I'm definitely for a nuclear defense system. I really enjoyed it!"
3,Ages and Stages,"This is an average book. I personnaly don't think it worth the price. I think it depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for development of your child, I suggest that you read Louise Bates Ames serie: Your one-year-old, Your Two-year-old, etc. even if it is a little bit outdated.If you are lokking for discipline, then I recommend: Kid Cooperation: How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading and Get Kids to Cooperate. By far the best parenting book that I have read.------------------------------------------------------------Jean Boucher is an international comedy magician..."
1,Horrified,"My husband got this as a hand me down and started reading it today. I glanced at the page he had open and am horrified at what I read. Page 8 in the grey box titled ""Age Differences"" and I quote ""For the first 6 months, infants do not feel love and affection. They are wholly dependent on their caretakers to have their needs met-that's all"". What old school garbage! As a mother of a 3 week old it's already obvious to me that my daughter feels love and affection."
2,"Very, very basic","This book has a nice voice, but it is for people who have absolutely no idea how to parent. Most of the material is so obvious that it scares me to think someone would not know it. Honestly, I think it may also be written by people who have not parented for a very long time. It sounds kind of old-fashioned relative to what are considered best practices today.There are some occasional helpful items here, but mostly it's stuff that is entirely common sense."
4,Very Helpful,A good reference book for any babysitter/nanny/daycare worker. I have referred to this book many times when faced with difficult situations. I highly recommend it.
1,Really pretty lame,There really isn't anything new in here and just states the obvious like don't beat your kids and love them. Not worth the money.
4,A true heir to the New Orleans Rock 'n' Roll and Piano traditions,"A mixture of classic and modern N.O. songs performed most ably by a young Orleanian steeped in the tradition of his grandfather (Sugar Boy Crawford), James Booker, Professor Longhair, Mac Rebenack and the many others before him; together with a wonderful singing voice. He will be a star."
5,One of Eric Hiscock's Earlier Books-Great Sailing Adventure!,"This book is about stories of Eric Hiscock's early sailing days on ""Wanderer II"", off the coast of Ireland & Scotland, and his other two sailing boats: Dyarchy, and Tern II. This is more or less of how his long distance ocean cruises got started with him & his wife. In fact, this book includes the story of the first ocean voyage that they made. It shows how they got started and learned a lot ""the hard way"" along their journeys. The maps, drawings and B & W photos are a welcome addition and his writing style is easy to follow - you will feel like you are sailing with them!"
3,Not an Easy Read for Lay People,"Very technical book about the art of physical relaxation, the release of residual tensions from the neuromuscular system of the body, including the mind. The author believed that the way to relax the mind was to relax the body. ""If the patient is shown how to relax the voluntary system, there later tends to follow a similar quiescence of the vegetative apparatus. Emotions tend to subside as he relaxes."" Relaxation must be cultivated until it becomes a habit, until it proceeds ""automatically with little or no clearly conscious direction."" Relaxation is ""the negative of doing.""This book has important insights to offer, but non-professionals will likely find it too technical, even unreadable at times. Perhaps boring or irrelevant to their needs. Chapters 4 to 6 are the meat of the book, the how-to chapters. They discuss the nature and technique of relaxation."
2,Not much here,"I was disappointed in this movie, I did not expect a classic film here, but the quality of the DVD was terrible almost unwatchable. The storyline was not that good either. I am a big fan of Fred Williamson' movies, but not this one."
2,JUST ANOTHER ACTION FLICK; 2.5 STARS,"A COP [FRED WILLIAMSON] IS HIRED TO PROTECT A YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER FROM A VERY MURDEROUS MOTORCYCLE GANG. THIS POORLY FILMED ACTIONER IS YOUR USUAL ACTION FLICK. BUT, IT IS OCCASIONALLY FUN TO WATCH. AT LEAST THERE IS SOME GOOD ACTION AND THERE IS SOME COOL VILLAINS. THOUGH THIS IS QUITE FAR FROM BEING A GOOD MOVIE, IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN ONE WOULD MOST LIKELY EXPECT. FANS OF FRED WILLIAMSON WILL MOST LIKELY ENJOY THIS. IF THIS FILM ONLY HAD A BETTER SCRIPT AND SOME BETTER ACTING, THIS MIGHT'VE BEEN A MUCH BETTER MOVIE. SHOCKINGLY, THIS MANAGED TO SPAWN TWO SEQUELS."
5,FRENCHIN WITH THE KING OF ZYDECO,"THIS CD WAS RECORDED IN 1976 IN BOGALUSA, LOUISIANA AND INCLUDES A SPECIAL GUEST INCLUDED WITH THE RED HOT LOUISIANA BAND, MR STANLEY'BUCKWHEAT.DURAL ON PIANO AND ORGAN, WHICH ADDS FLAVOR TO THIS CD!THE MAJORITY OF THESE SONGS ARE IN CREOLE FRENCH, AND MAKES IT A VERY DESIRED CD.THIS IS JUST ANOTHER GREAT CD BY CLIFTON CHENIER!"
1,Poor scholarship and amateur theology-very polemic,"I read this book by Brent Graves a few years ago, and found the scholarship very poor. It was based on some nuances in Greek, which do not matter much. It is very amateurish and shallow in its theological presentation. It is very polemic and shows the theological roots of misunderstanding in Mr. Graves theology: The Churches of Christ and the Worldwide Church of God. Both of which had claims to absolute truth and another claim to be ""The True Church"".Mr. Graves wrote this book with a lot of passion, but not much theological understanding about basic systematic theology. It is an interesting read, in that it is an attempt to promote Sabellian theology."
5,This book is a joy!,"Highly recommended. Very complete and entertaining at the same time. If you love dogs, this belongs in your home."
5,Very nice book.,I Loved the cavalier art.Good treatment of breed standard.Superb pen & ink illustrations to show breed standard. What artist did these?
5,The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in North America,A very informative book on Cavalier King Charles Spaniels--easy to read and full of valuable information. A must for Cavalier King Spaniel owners and for those researching the breed! Lovely photos and illustrations.
1,Over priced....mundane,"this reminds me of one of the AKC books where you put in the name of the breed, and none of the textual information is changed...for this price, we should have had some color pictures!"
2,A Breeder's Vanity Book,"This is a typical breeder's vanity book. It has some valuable information, but it is very weak in the very important area of health issues. Cavaliers suffer from major hereditary diseases, such as mitral valve heart disease, the leading killer of the breed, which is a terminal illness which afflicts over half of all Cavaliers by age 5 years and nearly all Cavaliers by age 10 years, and hip dysplasia, which causes terrible pain and debilitation, and syringomyelia, which causes severe head and neck pain and paralysis."
5,As authentic as it can get,"Prehistorical cavemen in search of fire.A lot of research went into this French film. It is purely fictional, but as realistic as it could get.The story line is good and the enthnographic understanding very interesting.I use it in teaching to understand the origins of technology. It works very well. There is also some gratuitous sex scenes which the students love."
1,A mistake,I accidently bought two copies of this DVD. Most of the people who gave it 5 stars had to be gaming the system.
1,not too clean,"not very believable, not very entertaining, comon, even dogs and cats groom themselves, watch the beginning of 2001 for just 25 min and save yourself some time."
1,Snoozfest for Fire,"A highly effective sleep-aid, guaranteed to induce involuntary drowsing with just the click of a ""play"" button. Plot synopsis: Grunt. Groan. Ooooh! (they find fire)."
5,The best prehistoric movie ever.,"This film is a clasic. It draws together great talent from the director Jean-Jacques Annaud (The Bear), to the consultants, such as anthropologist Desmond Morris and others, to make a film that goes to the heart of the human condition. This is what life was like at the dawn of man. You feel a kinship with the characters, an innate understanding of their situation because your ancestors were there! Quest is also a good story on every level. It is powerful, evocative and moving; once seen you feel the need to see it again every so often, almost like searching your ""roots"". It is a jewel and belongs in your collection. Not to have this movie on DVD is a crime against humanity!"
2,movie review,simplistic movie about Neanderthal meeting a water or plains tribe during a journey to find a new fire source for their clan.
2,Disappointing caveman movie,"This movie starts out mildly interesting, then starts getting boring throughout. There are no words spoken in the movie that can be understood (the cavemen have their own unique language). I continued watching it to the end, hoping that it would become more interesting, but was disappointed. This is one movie that I don't plan to watch again - unless I need a sleep aide."
5,Very happy pensioner,"This was bought as a present i did""nt think it was available anywhere but thanks to amazon i found a web site selling this item. I was very pleased with the service also the fast response in recieving the item. The packaging was also excellent"
5,FIRE OF KNOWLEDGE,"It is an excellent movie which recreates a period where human beings fighted so hard against elements of nature.Values as patience, solidarity,love and reliability are depicted in a good way for kids and adults. Highly recommendable movie!"
3,A worthy quest,"If you're looking for a movie with words then this isn't for you. If you're looking for a movie with a lot of action then, again, this isn't for you. But if you're looking for a movie that explores what early man may have lived through, but with realism then this movie is right up your alley.In Quest for Fire the director shows his vision with amazing clarity. The costumes are also really good. They look exactly what I would expect early man to look like. No well groomed cave men in this movie.It is slow though for a modern audience. The movie kind of slides along at a gentle pace. It may bore a few people, but it's not really boring enough to want to turn it off. Cavemen didn't spend all their time running from animals trying to eat them.It's light on action, blood, and sex. The actual sex parts are handled very tastefully, and more in a cultural context than just to be there.It's apparently a classic and I can see why it is."
5,Beautifull,"I realy love this movie, this is a great story,this has nothing to do with realistic facts or trying to convince the viewer that now we realy know what went on because we just discovered some new bone, trying to give some fake documentary feel to it, this is not creating nifty special effects because the kids love it so much, this is great acting and a fantastically well told story.This is a successful and beatifull reenactment of the things people had to go through as we can imagine it.I think the movie makers showed some real integrity in trying to get their facts right but understood the fact thet they weren't making a documentary but a movie, telling a story.The story reminds me of great literature like Robinson Crusoe or the biblical tales.A real feat as the story inherently can't rely upon verbalisticism.An excellent movie, a very moving, touching story."
5,What Do You Mean No Spoken Words?,"Quest for FireI told my teenage Grand-Daughter this movie had no words and you should have seen the look I got. Reluctantly she started watching with me and then she wanted to buy her own copy. This is a genius film that you will never forget and want to watch again and again over the years as I have. It contains all the emotions you want from a film and if you enjoy books like Jean Auel writes, you're going to place the Disc with those books. We think of the ""Cavemen"" that lived on this earth so long before us as being the same. With critical research that's been done it shows us what really was. All kinds of people with different looks, languages, foods and skills. They learned from each other, either by choice or not. This is a must see."
3,Good Movie....Not so good DVD,"Was so excited that this movie is finally coming out on DVD. First time for me to watch it in its' full form.(was not allowed to view it during the time of its release cause I was only 11 yrs. old)The movie is great except for the DVD... Generally, video quality is pleasing...but there are scenes which are grainy specially landscape views...grainy to the point of distraction..In short, the DVD release did not do justice for the film. I gave it 3 stars cause its just a so and so DVD release. Was not pleased with the video quality. They could have made it better. For fans of the movie...get a copy..but...don't expect too much on the video quality..."
2,Not as good as the first release..,This version of the movie is missing the dry humor and gentile affection that made the first release of the film such a pleasure to watch.
3,Gift of Silence,"I have a coworker who is of the same movie demographic as I. He went is search for this film for his memorabilia. His search was in vain, so I went to the unfailing search place of my choice, and I was able to procure his request. Thank you Amazon for your unfailing resources."
3,An Interesting Movie.,"I finally saw this movie for the first time just recently and can say that I wasn't disappointed. It's not one of my favorite movies that I've seen, but I can easily say that that it was interesting and didn't bore me. All the actors did great jobs. It must have been a tremendous undertaking when they were filming this movie. On the whole, this was a pretty good movie and worth a watch."
5,looking for fire,I didn't see this movie when it came out but my husband did and told me to order it because he liked it. I saw it and I almost died it is so vivid especially the sex scene. It was something to watch their journey as they searched for fire.
4,review DVD Quest for Fire,Good movie. Fun to watch. Glad I bought it. Can recommend it to everybody who likes SF/fantasy and/or likes an heroic movie without heroes.
4,"Artsy, good, but not for everyone","To a student or fan of anthropology this movie reflects the general concepts of human pre-history: neanderthals struggling to survive and the rise of modern humans in their midst. The idea though that neanderthals were brainless apes has more or less been discounted, so the movie is somewhat dated. However, the notion that modern humans were simply better suited to survive seems to be accurately reflected in this movie. The fact that there is no ""dialogue"" means that the actors had to convey themselves through gestures and movements, and they do this exceptionally well throughout the film."
4,A noble attempt to capture the far distant past,"Different primitive tribes interact 80,000 years ago trying to keep their fire alive so they don't freeze and starve.Visually stunning, and ultimately somewhat moving. But somehow, although it's very well done, it's hard to forget you're watching a movie.I found myself falling out of the story and thinking about what a great technical job they did making these actors look and sound like cave people, ratherthan being caught up in their situation. Also, the score can also be over the top at times.Still, ambitious, original and interesting (if scientifically dubious at moments)."
3,Quest for Fire,"I had seen this movie years ago - funny how age changes us. It wasn't as ""dramatic"" as I remember it when I was younger, but still a decent movie."
3,pretty good,this is your average caveman movie. it was good enough to keep me interested i kind of liked it.
2,I couldnt finish it,"I know its an old movie, so I shoulnt be too harsh on it. I bought it because the premise was interesting to me. But this movie was so boring to me I couldnt even finish watching it. I literally stopped it, took it out, and put a different movie in. Maybe its because theres no talking in it. The early humans are portrayed more as apes. I have no problem with this as I do believe in evolution, but it just made for a boring movie. I think if a larger budget movie with a similar concept was done today, it would be great. Maybe someday when I'm in the right mood, I'll try watching this again."
3,a love story,"boy meet girl ,girl wants to go home to mom runs off, boy gets mad and heads home but wants girl ,goes back to the last place their were together,goes after girl"
4,Interesting,"I saw this movie years ago, still a good movie. The acting is good for a piece with really no speaking parts."
5,A Great Must See Movie!,Great movie for it's time. It seemed as though you go back into time at that very moment when a great revelation of discovering that man can make fire and not have to hunt it down. I love the expression on their faces when they realize that they would never be without fire again! They would never have to fight or die to have it from then on! I recommend this movie for adults only because of some explicit sexual scenes in it!
5,Compact evolution,This film takes the prehistoric technological and social revolution and links it all together without the viewer even knowing the language. From the learning of how fire is made to our social feelings. Excellent acting.
1,"Brilliant book, enjoyable.","Brilliant , very enjoyable. Man's curiosity and subsequent development... all the family loved this, not only entertaining but educational too."
5,"You""ll look at lighters in a whole new light-pardon the pun:)",This movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! If you like survival stories than this is a great one to see! I don't know if I'd see it with younger kids because there are three sex senes and the female is naked throughout the whole movie. The acting is fantastic! This is truely a must see!!
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,"I LOVE Junko Mizuno, and this book is EXACTLY what I was looking for! It's ALL pictures! Every page is a colorful full page picture! There is a wide range of topics, (very adult, boobies),cute, scary, colorful, detailed, and gore. What more could you ask for? Buy it now, you won't regret it!"
4,thursday is college night!!! YEAH!!!,"hey, i'm 25 and i think this CD is killer too!!! I thought they might change up their sound a whole bunch after all the negative stuff Thursday were saying about War All The Time in interviews when it seemed like they might break up etc. anyhoo, this CD is a perfect balance of the soft creepy parts from Full Collapse and the harder technical parts from War ... and mixed in with some really good vocal harmony parts of course. Seems like no one gives this band a harder time than the band itself, so they should be happy and let up a bit and drink a beer or a glass of perfectly chilled white wine (it is almost summer in Jersey and the bugs and humidity is just aroudn the bend) cause this CD is good."
5,OMG WTF LOL BBQ,It's funny that Spin and/or Rolling Stone gave this album a dismal review rating --yet obviously the fans love it.It's a great album. I really like Thursday and this record is evolutionary without comprimising thier core sound. Quite a rare feat.Let' hope Thursday keeps at it for a while longer.
4,A return to the familiar,"Almost 3 years in the making, Thursday returns with an album reminiscent of the Passion of 'Full Collapse', but with the maturity or more well developed song writing. This is a big step above 'War All the Time' which was somewhat confusing to some fans at times, but this time around they clear everything up. The Vocals return with the passion you'd expect from Geoff, and the bass lines pack as much punch as 'Full Collapse' while the keys and Guitars seem a lot more focused than 'War All the Time'. This album is a lot easier to get into and the songs seem to be almost epic, without being long and drawn out. Great songs like ""Counting 5-4-3-2-1"" and ""At This Velocity"" show that the band still has the punch and melody that got you into them and loving it."
2,Poor sound quality distracts from music,"I have Full Collapse and War All the Time, both are what I consider excellent albums, and after reading all the reviews on this site, thought this album would be also. To be honest, after listening to it once, I don't have any great desire to listen again, mostly because the sound quality is a big step down from their previous albums. I'm not that picky in my music, but I don't want a band like Thursday to sound like the garage band down the street. Maybe the lyrics are great, but I'm just so distracted by the distinct decrease in sound quality that I can't appreciate the other parts. I would be OK if this was their first album, but it isn't, and I had some high expectations for this newest album. Unfortunately, it's not quite what I expected or what I like."
3,Severely Disappointed,"I give the new Thursday cd a 3 star rating only because of the songs, ""At This Velocity"" and ""We Will Overcome."" Full Collapse and War All The Time were much much better. Recording is sketchy and I feel like I wasted $14. Download those two songs and save your money[of course you'll buy the downloads:)] Underoath's ""Define The Great Line"" and Taking Back Sunday's ""Louder Now"" are much much better choices."
2,all of you are fools...,This album would be great if Thursday was not the name of the band.... But it isOnly at this velocity delivers what made them great in full collapse!They have went from screamo to emo to lamoAlso the drums sound like they have no mics on them where is the tight production we saw in the last two albums???Are the penny pinching or just getting lazy?
3,Poor sound quality ruins a great album,"I am really confused by all the great reviews for this album. In my opinion, the sound quality on this record is terrible, which is a crime because I think the songs are some of Thursday's best. The whole album sounds muffled - like you're listening to it through cotton or like it's been copied several times. The vocals are nearly impossible to make out on almost all songs. I'd think I got a bad recording (though I bought the CD new at a major retailer) except a few other reviewers have pointed out these problems. I'm very disappoined in Thursday either way - either they purposefully released this mess or they allowed a record this poorly mastered to be marketed."
3,OK.........not great,"If you are a fan of Thursday, then you will probably get this album and like it regardless of what anyone says. If, on the other hand, you haven't heard (much) of these guys before, then, you might not really like this. Most of the songs either drag on for way too long, or never really seem to get going. Don't get me wrong, the music is good, but I just wasn't impressed. I was looking for something a little less epic. I wanted more emo, and less Dream Theater."
4,A City by the Light Divided,"Great album. ""The Lovesong Writer"" is an incredible song. The sound is so retro, yet haunting at the same time. At a time where good music is hard to come by, Thursday delivers."
1,Hardcover is a cheap reproduction,I purchased the hardcover and its not bound like the rest of the series. It was a generic hardcover (library bound?) and the cover was a sticker! Returning.
5,one of herge's best,"Blue Lotus is certainly one of Herge's best, along with Cigars, Broken Ear, Tintin in Tibet, Red Rackams Treasure. What I find to be true in his best books is the belief that never dies which is that there is some point of contact possible between the relationships you pursue in your lifetime and the external world or the events and history of earth herself. This illusory point of contact is kept alive, we keep hoping for it, because Tintin is undefeatable since he never makes the mistake of loving."
5,The Blue Lotus,"The Blue Lotus truly is one of Herge's best works. Continuing the story of Cigars Of The Pharoah, the book portrays Tintin discovering the Oriental. Along with a well constructed plot and beautiful illustrations, the book accurately displays the prejudices that Occidentals felt for Orientals at the time, and the harships that the Chinese faced. I do believe this to be a classic in its own genre, and will keep me rereading it for years to come."
5,great art work!,In this adventure we get to see Tintin go to china. This is a very interesting book and I think any person liking comics should buy this.
1,black and white on inside,"We were so excited to get this in the mail, but the beautiful color illustrations are missing - with the exception of a few full-page color illustrations, this book is all black and white."
1,Inside is in Black and White,"Boy was I excited to get this book for my 7 yr old son. He doesn't like reading, but I remember reading this as a kid and lovin it. How did I feel when I opened it up only to find the entire book printed in B&W....back in the box and returned. The item received didn't look like the item I purchased, and the cover wasn't red as the ""look inside"" feature showed. I hope they straighten this out with their distributors. Watch out for the hardcover book."
2,SUCKY,"I HATE MUNROE SHOCKS BECAUSE THEY ARE CRAP-SOFT... PAID EXTRA AND GOT THESE - STILL UNSATISFIED, BUT MAYBE IT IS MY STYLE OF DRIVING AND HISTORY.. I AM USED TO STREET TRUCKS, PERFORMANCE VEHICLES ETC. I PUT BILSTEIN HD'S ON MY LAST TRUCK AND WAS IMPRESSED. ALL MY SHOCKS WERE SHOT ON THE HONDA SO I GRABBED THESE AND I AM NOT IMPRESSED. STILL LOTS OF BODY ROLL - STILL LOTS OF HOOPTY HUMP. JUNK IN MY BOOK - GETTING ANOTHER SET OF THE SUPER STIFF BILSTEINS THAT FEEL RIGHT TO ME."
4,"Hey man, This is a cool album","I'm a big Belle and Sebastian fan, and I love that whole Scottish Sound. I always thought that Stuart David's stuff was cool with B et S, (i.e. Mars and Elvis.) Just because it doesn't sound like ""Fox in the Snow"" or ""A Summer Wasting"" doesn't make it bad. I liked the disc and I liked the Modem Song and burn me at the stake but I liked it.Oh well, the thing is that you don't need substantial rhyme schemes when you have a good beat and I think that when you get this album it will definitely grow on you. (This album was a little harder to grasp than the better Up A Tree, but it's still good.) It's a nice CD to listen to whenever."
4,The future of twee?,"Stuart David's no longer a member of Belle and Sebastian, giving him more time to devote to Looper. This extra effort certainly shows on ""The Geometrid."" It's tighter, more diverse and song oriented than its predecessor. I never thought I'd say this about a Belle and Sebastian alumnus but with ""Money Hair,"" he's written the party song of the summer and proven that Looper is more than a cutesy-pie novelty act. The musicianship is a lot more professional this time around, possibly because he's incorporated his touring band as full-time Loopers and their influence is felt on the sweet (but never sloppy) ""On The Flipside"". This is a record that shows that sweet, catchy pop need not be exclusive of rhythm."
3,catchy electronic pop,"Loopers second album is slightly more complex than their debut, but also much the same. Simple, catchy electronic pop and spoken word tracks are the perfect soundtrack for a quiet spring day, but it's hard to imagine the album standing the test of time. Catchy and fun, but ultimately forgetable."
1,ATTENTION ALL 'BELLE...' FANS,"I was lured into buying this CD knowing its relation to my favorite band, Belle and Sebastian. This ""band"" is nothing like B&S!!! Its bad techno!! It goes against everything that acoustic B&S fans stand for. It's Scottish noise. I only wish someone could have warned me before it was too late! Once again, this band has nothing in common with Belle andf Sebastian accept for Stuart who only sings on one or two tracks. The other vocalists are awful. BEWARE!!"
4,Olde School Music,"This is olde School music to the Core, the elder at the Kwanzaa Celebration is going to love this music because people from all over the world celebrates Kwanzaa and many of them will celebrate here at the Heritage Village....."
2,Need more pictures/better description!,"I ordered this hat for my son, who had been looking for one that WASN'T adjustable in the back like a baseball cap. Well, because of the description, I thought this was the correct hat. The description did say ""the real McCoy""! It is adjustable. VERY DISAPPOINTED.But the shipping was extremely fast. And I really like the fact that it's made in the USA! Fortunately, my son liked the hat anyway, and decided to keep it. Hat appears to be very well made, and it looks pretty good in spite of the plastic adjustable strap in the back."
3,grannyof3,Wasn't too impressed with this hat. It was large for a child size. It also wasn't made out of very heavy material.
2,Railroad Hat,This hat does not appear to fit any adult I know. Very small. No time to return as needed it for a show. We altered it enough to use in the show.
5,Exactly what we wanted,I found this by scanning the bar code of a friends hat. We got the package quickly and it was exactly what we ordered.
5,engineer hat,My 64 year old husband has been a model train collector since age 10. He finally has a train room and layout but had no engineer hat. Now he does and is happy as a kid playing trains. That hat was just as he dreamed.
2,This item is overpriced,"I purchased this for use on an adult and it was not only too small it had an adjustable plastic band on the back that wouldn't catch. There are plenty of ""engineer caps"" on Amazon that are less expensive that are the same quality. I was looking for the ""real thing"" for an adult that would come in different sizes so that the hat actually would fit an adult head -- this one didn't do that. This hat would fit a small adult or a child. The quality is OK for a child, but not as a real engineer's hat."
4,Conductor's hat from the past.,This hat has gotten me more compliments then I thought. One man who worked for the telephone company told me how to press it and starch it to make it look better. Thank you
1,Wrong Size Twice,"I ordered 2 hats, large size, and got one that fit and one that was too small. I contacted customer service and it offered a replacement for the mis-sized hat. Three days later, I got one that was smaller still. I gave up - a waste of time and money."
5,engineer hat,"a good quality, not cheaply made product, bought for a gift and it is better than we thought it would be"
5,Wonderful Jazz recording,"Dee Dee Bridgewater is a jazz singer in the tradition of Ella. If you like jazz, this is a must have."
1,Too Much Attitude,"Bridgewater's theatrical experience definitely works against her on this CD. The vocal posturing annoys and distracts. Her material is excellent, and her band really cooks. Drop the coy mannerisms and just sing, Dee Dee."
1,Didn't work.,"This thing didn't work. I didn't return it or anything because it was cheap as hell and I want to take it apart sometime. It didn't work at all, even with different cables.These switches don't work at all, actually. I got two different ones at a store and neither one worked without fuzz all over the screen."
2,There's a reason it's so cheap...,"Even though some customers complained, I ordered one and took a chance because it was so cheap. Mine was DOA (no right audio channel). But here's the story: The unit is flimsy plastic, housing a thin PCB with RCA jacks and a multi-pole/tri-throw switch soldered on. Upon opening (remove 4 small screws) I found that 5 connections, randomly located, were not soldered at all. It took me 6 minutes to solder and reassemble, and now it works fine."
1,Look's good ...... Didn't work,Item did not function and was of very poor quality. I went to Radio shack and purchased a much better one.
4,get's it done,"Cheap, does what I was looking for and does it well. Much easier to change a switch than constantly unplug and replug cables."
2,"Good Idea, But Poor Quality","I bought this switch in order to connect my cable box (RCA connectors) and DVD (also RCA connectors) to my TV (ditto RCA). It works well - except I had some issues with the connectors becoming loose - to the point I had to tape the connectors. This device would probably be good if you intend to connect once, and just use the on-board switch to select between your input devices. I repeatedly attached headphones to the output so I could listen to my TV without disturbing my wife (just in case you intend to use headphones - suggest trying a different switch - which I have not found yet to replace this one:)"
2,You get what you pay for,The AV cables had cheap plugs and only 2 of the 3 Inputs worked. Not impressed. Can't recommend this product.
3,"Port works, FREE cable is rubbish","I have just begun using this AV port with the FREE cable. The cable is absolutely useless. Do not buy it if you are depending on the cable. I had my own AV cable (red, white & yellow male ends). The port works. It is a very, poor quality plastic, but works. I'm using it for a Sony DVD player and a Nintendo Wii. I have them plugged into a new Vizio TV with a composite audio/video set up. It works with this set up. It's a good solution for to connect older technology with new electronics."
2,Bad pic quality,"Tried a bunch of different RCA leads same result, faded picture and horizontal lines, watchable but pretty bad. It's cheap, I guess thats why."
3,not as good as the first - but not too bad either,"Lost City of Gold starts out as a fun adventure just like the previous Quatermain movie King's Solomons Mines. It stays that way for a fun journey to the lost city but once they get there it becomes a Clift's Notes version of Haggard's novel without very much of the silly fun as the first film or the first half of this one. They should have taken longer to get to the lost city I guess. It's still worth seeing though and fans of King Solomon's Mines will love the first half. Those who haven't seen the first film will probably enjoy it since they wont compare it to the superior previous movie. Chamberlain, Stone, and Jones are all in good form and are extremely fun to watch in the first half of the film. After that they do their best but the lost city isn't much fun to hang around once it's been found. 3 and half stars for the good stuff."
1,Fast forward through first half,"Don't bother watching before they find the lost city, peopled by a ""legendary white tribe"" in the middle of Africa. Of course they're the ones with the gold."
5,Great fun and adventure,The charactors Kept me laughing and on the edge of my seat. And Richard Chamberlain is plain hot.
4,Recipient likes it greatly,This was ordered for someone as a gift. He is very happy with it in every regard. Can't do better than that..
3,enjoyable Saturday matinee fare,"Enjoyable adventure tale, obviously inspired by ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (1986) was the sequel to 1985's surprise summer hit ""King Solomon's Mines"", again starring Richard Chamberlain as the gun-ho adventurer Quatermain with a fresh, young Sharon Stone as his spunky fianceé Jessie.The story finds Allan on the trail of his missing brother. Along the way, Quatermain and Jessie stumble across the mythical lost city of Gold, ruled by a power-mad High Priest (a particularly hammy turn from Henry Silva); and two buxom princesses (Aileen Marson and Cassandra ""Elvira"" Peterson).The special effects have dated horribly and the plot makes NO sense whatsover. THE LOST CITY OF GOLD won't challenge your mind but it offers a solid 95 minutes of entertainment...remember it?Grab the hot buttered popcorn and settle back."
5,"Relaxing, fun movie","I've always enjoyed action movies with a touch of humor like Indiana Jones, etc and this is a good ""watch"". I had it on VHS and bought the DVD to upgrade my movie library. I recently bought Alan Quatermain and King Solomon's Mines to make a set and both are good if you want to relax and watch something with action and some light humor."
3,very funny,This DVD is worth picking up for the first half which is a riot! The entire journey to the Lost City is the best part and incredibly amusing and it's just one crazy thing after another! Very very funny!
1,"Ribs, the lion, and I have a bone to pick with you","This movie was absolutley hilarious in its attempts at an Idiana Jones rip off. Needless to say it was not even close. Granted I didn't see the prequel or the beginning but I saw enough to see how silly it was. In one cave scene they are walking and are randomly attacked by a lion, the lion had no significance to the ""so-called"" plot and it the attack was never mentioned again. The ending is weak and confusing. Why was the lightining striking the axe? Also, why did Sharon Stone's character have a ""bone to pick"" with that priestess woman? Nowhere in the movie was she ever disrespected by the woman. And also the priestess woman wore a vest with chains that looked like her ribs. I recommend seeing this movie at three in the morning because everything is quite hilarious."
5,Quality and Personal satisfaction of DVD (Allan Quatermain and the lost City of gold),Allan Quatermain and the lost city of gold DVD is of the highest quality and i am completely satisfied withthe product and i recommend it without reservation!-M.E.
1,Mankind's Greatest Cultural Achievement,"Webster's dictionary:Dreck: adj. see: Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of GoldApparently James Earl Jones dedicated his salary to a group of bounty hunters charged with the task of tracking down every known copy of this film and destroying it. The effort failed, unfortunately. Run. Run while you still can."
3,PURE HILARITY!!!!!!!!!LAughed till (...) came out!!,"So hilarious! I could not stop laughing. some friends went so far as to do a bashing on the internet, in sound formats. (...)It's good to see others get a laugh out of quatermain too!"
4,NOT ALL WET!,"Wasn't sure if this product would keep my bandages dry while showering the 2 weeks after foot surgery,but it did. It has to be secured properly to prevent any leakage but it was perfect. I was able to shower with little concern. It held up very well, it will be available for use in the future (if needed). Also, it arrived very quickly after I placed my order."
3,Shower boot,The shower boot needs a little work. It does keep the water off the wound which is what it's supposed to do but getting it on & off is a real struggle.
3,Great Film,But fell asleep watching it and have not had a chance to watch it in it's entirety. Will try to do so soon. Thank you.
5,Hilarious,So. Much. Innuendo. It was hilarious. My friends and I could not stop laughing. Cary Grant is the date-rape angel.
1,Money unwisely spent,"I would have given it no stars if I had that option. The movie is an Asian language movie and I did not realize that when I purchased. Don't know how to check the original ad to see if it was my mistake. I don't speak the language, so spent the money for nothing."
5,Delightful --- forgotten,"Great performances by Grant, young and Niven. And wonderful story well suited for Christmas. Cameo, nearly, appearance by Myrna Loy adds to the experience."
4,Heartwarming,A standard for us at holiday time. Cary Grant and David Niven are fabulous as always. The boys choir scene was especially moving for me.
5,chicken soup for teenage sould letters,chicken soup for the teenage soul letters is a book that has a lot of volumes. i really liked this book because it was very interesting. some of the stories were really sad and some of them were really happy.some people would talk about how their life was really bad and how they didn't want to live on this earth anymore and some were really happy love stories. this book was a book talking about real people and real things that happen to kids in their teenage year. when i read this i didn't get bored because it was very eye catching. it's like when you start reading it you just can't stop.so i give this book 5 stars because i like it so much. if you read this book you will not regret it because it's that great.
3,OK feelin',"The album starts off with a real nice piano piece, which is rare from T-bone (from what I've heard). The album goes on to have a few high points.Some tracks have trivial lyrics and can get a bit repititive, but a pretty good album overall."
1,No essential at all.,I cannot believe this CD got Grammy award. Only value of this CD is the first and last track in which T-Bone plays the piano. I respect 40s' T-Bone Walker but not this one. This CD is just like tachno.
5,Good Organizer,This is a good organizer for small projects or just keeping track of a temporary project both home and office.
4,Interesting and entertaining!,This book was really interesting as well as entertaining. I really got caught up in the plot and couldn't wait to see if Rachel could get out of her troubles with the law. The romance side of the book also had me hooked. I would highly recommend this book to Janelle Taylor fans and anyone looking for an interesting love story.
2,Music that influenced R&R,CD of terrific Blues Music Mississippi Fred Mcdowell. His rhythms created the original rock and roll beat. This CD is very early and a good representation of his style.
4,Definitive blues slide guitar,"This is classic blues slide guitar. Fred McDowell takes traditional country blues a step further, growing the roots of what would become rock and roll. At first, the constant drone of his rhythms seemed monotonous, but the longer I listened to this CD, the more I appreciated it; using a cliche, it grew on me."
3,"Don't order from these ""slow"" ass people","It took this company far too long to send the product. Although it was in the specified time, it 'could have' been sent sooner. I would not recommend this company because it took them too long to mail the book. Not good! If you can send the product sooner, then do so. Don't wait until the last minute."
3,Peek-a-boo where are you?,"My 16 month old granddaughter likes this book, but not as well as the ""Rock-a Baby,"" her all-time favorite, now out of print. The flaps are difficult to reach from the top of page, however, easier to work than the ""Rock-a-baby"" moving parts. Peek-a-boo lacks the rhythm of ""Rock-a baby,"" (Rock-baby, roll, baby, toddle-wobble, too)...which is why I rate it 3 stars. Have the author bring back Rock-a-Baby 2"" in a lift-flap format and it will sell!!!"
2,Bad controls ruin this game,"This game could have been a viable Mortal Kombat clone with its good graphics and decent sound effects (although the announcer sounded like a Chinese Steve Urkel), but sluggish (and at times unresponsive) controls ruin this one."
3,"Poor MK rip, but still one of the best Jag games.","This game is one of the worst MK rips out there. I will say it has as much blood as MK but the characters are lame. The graphics are maybe the best thing, but thats not even good. And with so many Jaguar games being so bad, this is one of the better games they have. For any other system this game would get a two. If you own a Jag its worth getting, but if you're getting a Jag you're a collector anyway. To others stay away."
4,Can you say Camp.,"This is simply a rare system. It never lasted and has real camp value. The controls were something else too.The they even made a Jaguar CD. On this system there isn't really many games, and further more the ""64 bit"" system was only a little more powerful then the SNES. If you plan on playing a old system and want the best of the early mid 90s look at 3DO. It was as powerful as PS one, and came out two years earlier. It was a head of its time, this was behind.The games I can mention are Arati Karts(not bad at all) Kasumi Ninja(ah) and Primal Rage for Jag CD.(3DO,32x,PSone are better ports)This system really is for camp value only."
4,Excellent read,Not my normal type of read but she definitely delivers gripping stuff. Cannot wait to finish the trilogy. I hope it finishes on a high note.
5,RAVENS,This is just what we were looking for IT'S RAVENS PURPLE. We will be back to re up our supply.
5,80 point increase!,"I used this book for about two weeks, completing all of the sections. I looked over all of the questions I had gotten wrong on my first go-around with the book on the Thursday bfore the test. I also took one of the practice tests, and it predicted within 20 points what I got on the real Math SAT.In my sophomore year, I had gotten a 640, which was disappointing, but after using this book for two short weeks my score shot up to a 720 (as a Junior)! I would recommend this book to anybody wishing to increase their score with a concise, concentrated workbook.Unless your score is very low on the Math section, a book full of basic skills and tricks will probably not help you. Using this workbook could be the difference between a mediocre 640 and a pretty-durn-good 720 (and only in two weeks).Good luck!PS: On the SAT, there was a problem that even used the same numbers as one of the questions in the Kaplan book! Weird..."
2,Vague Explanations,This book contains very good practice material but the explanations to the answer choices are very vague and difficult to understand.
2,It's not worth it; it's a waste of time,This is a very good if you need a brush up on the very basics like percentage and fractions. This is the first 200 pages and it is very easy. It gives you a sense of achievement and wrongly makes you think you will ace the SAT. The SAT is not this easy...The harder concepts are poorly explained. Explanations to practice questions and tests are extremely shallow and vague. Some of the techniques are much too convoluted and take too much time. There are better strategies than what this book offers.
1,better choice out there,"Try Barrons Math Workbook, it's much more organized and comprehensive. There is a lot of empty space with this Kaplan book."
2,SAT MATH WORKBOOK,"The workbook is great. I know this as my older daughter used it and felt prepared after working with it for a few weeks. My younger daughter is an ""accelerated"" student taking honors calculus in her junior year of highschool. The problem is she doesn't remember the basics that are more often found in the SAT. Algebra, etc. So it's important to review. Now if someone could write a book about how to get your kid to open and use the book, that would be a bestseller. So far, no dice with this one."
3,Bill Withers song is called Use Me Up,"I know, cause I'd been hearing it on the radio and had to call the radio station to see who sang it."
3,Dido sings the Thank You song,"Who sings the song ""I want you to want me, the way that I want you""? It was playing on the jutbox in the second story at the bar"
3,Not enough songs that belong,"I, too, would really like to find the song that was playing while Chloe Sevigny and Michelle Williams were making love in the 70's version...it sounds like Santana, and I noticed a lot of us want to find it! Please if someone knows, please leave a note."
2,Songs on the soundtrack which don't belong to the film!,I bought this soundtrack and was very surprised about the collection of the songs. I missed some of the film. Others were performed by other artists. And some have nothing to do with the film. I think they were put on the CD to fill the disk!
2,Disappointed-Wanted to hear the older songs!,"I ordered this CD when the tracks listed included Lobo, and the correct artist for ""Lean On Me,"" etc. Once I got the CD, it had completely different tracks, and I wanted to hear tracks from the first two parts of the show. I am not happy with the final tracks for the CD. It was a let down."
2,THE WRONG TRACKS ARE LISTED ABOVE!,"Here is the REAL track listing: 1. Mama I'm strange - Melissa Etheridge 2. Sisters are doing it for themeselves - Eurythmics 3. Closer to Fine - Indigo Girls 4. Everloving - Moby 5. Disco Inferno - Cyndi Lauper 6. Joy to the World - Three Dog Night 7. Lean on Me - Club Nouveau 8. It's only make believe - Glen Campbell 9. Yum Yum (give me some) - Pulse 10. Check it out - Karmadelics 11. Nothingness - Karmadelics 12. Wild Wicked Wanda - Johnny Legend 13. Samba Pa Ti - CJ VanstonI don't know about you, but I was disappointed when I saw these tracks instead. It was a big let down."
1,If These Walls Could Talk 2 Soundtrack,"Well, I am really really disappointed with this CD. The tracklist is completely inaccurate and all the songs that you would really want, like Lobo or the ""Thank You"" song are missing. I am totally bummed. If you are looking for a song look it up by artist 'cause you ain't gonna find it here."
2,Don't Be Fooled By the TRACK LIST!,"If you are REALLY in love with a specific song on this soundtrack, like the LOBO song for example, make sure you know what is REALLY on the CD before you order. This track list is not exactly accurate!"
2,If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000 TV Movie),"THe song of the title menu sung by two women in the same beautiful style of THE FLOWER DUET from LAKMÉ by Delibes, is Antonio Vivaldi's Concerto in G major for two guitars/mandolins , ADAGIO. I don't know who is performimg the beautiful song. I have been trying to find it in other CD but it seems almost impossible. can anyone help me? israelonofre@yahoo.com.br"
3,DVD music,"I really need to know, on the DVD, what is the song played on the title menu? I've looked everywhere trying to figure out what it could be and i haven't had any luck. Please help!"
1,Buy this CD if you want to hear songs not in this movie,"I found this CD to be very disappointing. As I listened to it I hardly recognized any of the songs from the movie(which I loved!). In particular, I wanted to hear the song played during the love scene between Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres, but it's not on this CD. If you want to hear that song, it's titled Thank You by Dido on her No Angel CD. Take my word for it, don't buy If These Walls Could Talk II CD, but definitely buy the No Angel CD."
3,Answering question.,"To the person that wanted to know the name of the song that played when Sharon Stone found out she was pregnant is ""This will be"" by Natalie Cole. I would like that CD with that song also. Hope someone out there can help."
3,...,"For those of you who were wondering the name of the sexy song where the 2 girls are having yummy sex in the 70's one, the song is Samba Pa Ti by Santana."
2,"""Ripped-Off"" all the way around.","The ""original"" soundtrack actually had several of the songs listed as being on the CD, whether or not they were, you would need to find a copy of one of the first burned, before the movie hit HBO. Once it did, Dido, pulled ""Thank You"", because it was such a hit and she didn't want people buying the soundtrack and not her new album! I too went to a music store to look for it and found songs listed as being on it, but were NOT actually on the CD! I liked the previous comment about, ""How can they call it a soundtrack!"" It was quite disappointing!"
2,Disappointed! Wanted the tracks originally listed!,"If you want the songs from the movie, you'll be disappointed with this CD. I ordered this CD expecting the tracks originally listed above. The list has since changed, and the version of ""Lean on Me"" isn't even the correct artist from the movie. The CD isn't the same without the variety of tracks included in the movie. There's no Lobo or Doris Day. Just a few songs from the movie, and random club stuff. Someone needs to complain to Jellybean Recordings, Inc."
1,song search help,"bit late, but here it is. The song on the jukebox at the bar is ""I'd Love You To Want Me"" by Lobo. Don't look here for it on this CD, try his Greatest Hits albums."
2,Disappointing,"Since ""Turn in the Road"" I've been getting Julie Ellis' books from the library, and purchased the last two. ""Silent Rage"" starts off with promise, describing the ""unsung"" wounded soldiers returning from Iraq, but Joe Kelly, who is introduced at the beginning is never mentioned again. Instead, there seems to be a lot of repetitious filler about the perils of outsourcing--and even more coffee consumption in this novel than in the others--that fails to disguise a thin and implausible plot."
5,A lump in the throat...,"I recommend this book to all those who have wondered at the world in all it's forgotten glory and revelled in the faintest scent of flower and form that God has thrown into our hurried paths, who have stumbled through the woods deliriously yet, meditatively and choked on the overwhelming delicateness of silence that leads voices to whisper and tense jaws to slacken. Here in this volume of poetry you will find a companion whose reverence for life reverberates through verse after verse. This collection exemplifies Mr. Frost's idea that a poem should not be planned but should begin as ""a lump in the throat."""
3,No 'Stopping By the Woods on a Snowy Evening',"I was looking forward to reading 'Stopping By the Woods on a Snowy Evening', but came away disappointed. Of course, 'The Road Not Taken' is worth the price of admission regardless. It is chock-full - as chock-full as 53 pages can possibly be - of other Frost goodies.Overall, a good book for the price and a great addition to your order, but for serious Frost devotees I would suggest a more comprehensive collection."
4,rooted in New England,"These poems seem firmly rooted in New England and seem to be timeless, though decidedly pre-modern feel to them (this was originally published in 1916). Some of these poems may seem familiar ... ""The road not taken"" is popular at high school graduations. There are poems of nature such as The Oven Bird (""There is a singer everyone has heard,/ Load, a mid-summer and mid-wood bird,"") or ""Birches (""and they seem not to break; though once they are bowed/ for low for long, they never right themselves"") but with wider significance. There are also poems of rural isolation such as ""The Hill Wife"" and ""Snow"". His poetry plays by literary and poetic rules, and may not be simple to read, but he does not oversimplify life."
3,"Nice poems, but not about travel","I bought this book to give me something to read aloud to baby, and it fulfills that purpose masterfully. As expected, it is cheaply bound and cheap paper. As other reviewers noted though, few of the poems really related to travel. It seems like works were included if they referred to any method of travel (like usings ships as an analogy"". If I had purchased this book for the specific theme, I may have been disappointed."
4,Florianapolis saved the album,"I am a great fan of Mr. JM. When this album came out, it was clear that it had nothing to do with Mahavishnu, maybe because of extensive use of drum programming and Campbell's drums. However, the great piece Florianapolis, which John later released live (On Royal Albert Hall album) with excellent acoustic guitar and nice sax playing by Bill Evans improves the album great deal. With a few other nice acoustic and slow pieces, and with a powerful electric playing on The Wait, John managed to save his face. I gave it four stars, as it is very embarassing to give less to the great master."
3,Fire and cheese,"Here we have Mc's signature spicily fused jazz jams, distilled through plastic production essence with fleeting moments of contained experimental brilliance."
1,Very disappointed,"This Lipstick had very pretty color. It arrived on time BUT after I used it for few days ,lipstick broke and now I am not able to use it.Maybe it was old , I am not sure what the problem was. Also, it is listed as 4 or something $ but shipping is huge for this lipstick. I think they charged me almost 17$.Very disappointed."
5,nightmare before christmas,this book was a desperation leap to find something related to nightmare before christmas. my 30 year old granddaughter is a collector and i wanted something i knew she did not have...was well-pleased with the product and the communications...book arrived weeks before promised date (by airmail)...all were pleasantly surprised and delighted
5,It's fantasy pictures book!,"First time i saw this book, it gave me a shock! It's so beautiful and neat with those complicate stencils! therefore, really want to own one and look at it whenever i like! \(^o^)/"
5,COMPLETE MASTERPIECE...,"every single track on this album is a masterpiece...although i don't like Mission to Mars as much as the rest, this CD is probably one of the best that i own. It is definetly the best CD made by Strung Out...it shows extreme maturation from Twisted By Design, their previous release, and with it's dark, melodic, and technical sound, you'll be begging for more...the highlights are tracks 2-8...i guarentee you'll love this album...it's a shame that American Paradox did not even come close to the artistic level that EOSD reached.PLEASE GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!"
4,Not The Best But Not Bad,"The Element of Sonic Defiance has the makings to be great and shows the sound that strung out went on to perfect. Unfortunately this is not as good as previous work or later work. It is very experimental and on some of the songs such as Scarecrow, Razorblade & Mephisto their test worked perfectly but on songs like Mission to Mars it didnt. Mission to Mars has the musical capabilities to be a great song and is very upbeat but the words and rhymes ruin it.The other complaint is the album gets kind of boring on songs like Blew which makes it hard to listen to from beginning to end even though there are only 8 songs. I would still recommend this over other bands because strung out is always great but just get suburban, twisted by design & exile at least before this."
3,"A good effort, but it can't compare to their past releases..","Now, don't get me wrong. Most of this CD, is good. The first few tracks are basically heavy metal punk however, and Strung Out just isn't that good at it. Once it gets back into typical Strung Out fashion punk, its good, but there aren't any songs on here that really stick out as great songs. Jackie O.,( Jacqueline on ""The Fearless Flush sampler.."")is the best song on the CD by far, and it was written basically 4 or 5 years ago. If you're looking for another album of the same quality as ""Twisted By Design"", you're going to be dissapointed. Thats easily the best punk CD ever recorded, and this is good, but you can't follow that with anything other than another instant classic, which this is not. If you want a Strung Out CD, I would recommend Twisted by Design instead. Its overall a much better album, and has more tracks of classic Strung Out material."
2,Meh.,"I love strung out.. they keep getting better and better.. until now. I don't know what they were thinking, it's overproduced and none of the songs are even that interesting. Some are metal and some are like, radio punk or something. Save yourself the disappointment and wait for the next LP, hopefully that will be better. In the meantime if you gotta get a new EP, go pick up the one by Good Riddance."
2,"Not that great. Get 'Another Day in Paradise""","I was pretty excited to get this CD. I'm not sure what I was expecting, maybe another 'Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues', which is what 'Twisted by Design' was. I listened to this new CD several times, and I couldn't stop thinking that parts of it sounded like some corny old Dokken album. I hope Strung Out continues to experiment and progress with their music, they're just not going in the right direction on this CD. Leave the bleak, serious, 'thinking man's metal' to bands like the current Anthrax, they're better at it."
3,Strung Out Of Ideas...,"I was really psyched about the new Strung Out album... Frankly, it isn't that good. The first song Mission to Mars is just too metal... Far from the melodic punk rawk their so good at. Don't get me wrong, there are great songs... Jackie-O being my favorite... (but it's actually a remixed old song) If you're strung out fan... Well then maybe you should get this."
2,not my cup of tea.,"I fell in love with the strung out sound when I first heard the album ""suburban teenage wasteland blues"". The albums energy was intense throughout. Every track was great. The next album, ""twisted by design"" was also quite energetic but only with a couple slower, average tunes (Still well worth the price). I was eagerly awaiting the next strung out offering. This release, however, was quite disapointing. I can't put to words what's wrong with it. There is still some energy there, but the hard edge is gone. They have progressed I suppose, but their sound has transformed into something I don't much care for. I should give only one star, but I'll give two just because their past albums were so excellent. I will be curious to hear the next one, but I won't rush out and but it. I'll probably dl a few tracks to see which direction they're going in first."
4,McGee is always a pleasure,"I really enjoy the Travis McGee series and especially like this book. Much as I enjoy reading about his exploits in Florida, the change of scene to Chicago is an interesting change of pace. Perhaps more than average number of twists and turns in this plot, and a little more ""cringe factor"" from the violence than some of the other McGee books.As the title of my review indicates, I really like this series as a whole. They're among the books I go back to again and again when I'm restless and want something fun to read. I always learn something, whether it be about how to maintain a houseboat or how to kick someone's hide in a fight. :-)And I have some laughs doing it."
3,Not one of the ones that holds up the best,"This is one of the McGees that I end up not rereading as much, because for me it doesn't hold up quite as well. I realize that in this decade, LSD was a completely different thing than what we know it to be now, but it still throws me off guard; plus I am a little harsher on the perfect Dr. Fort Geis than the book would like me to be. If you're a T. McGee fan, read it and it may hold up better for you, but if you're new to the series, it probably won't make the best starting point."
2,Not Up To Par For JDM,"This entry of the T. McGee series was not up to plot or craftsmanship found in most of John D. MacDonald's work. To me, it seemed at times to be almost a parody of the usual McGee...too much TALK of broken birds, and just not enough of the rough and tumble action we have come to expect from Ol' Trav. But don't worry, things are back on track in the next one, PALE GRAY FOR GUILT. I've wondered if there wasn't something going on in JDM's personal life to make this entry seem so lacking?"
1,Hated this one,"I have liked the other McGee books, but this one was sickening. The novel suffers from the ponderous exposition, as other reviewers noted. And the ending--without spoilers, I can say that it was so over-the-top violent and deliberately disturbing that I wonder about the author's mental health. And the solution came on what was a clumbsily-written deus ex machina. Get another McGee book--any other McGee book--but not this one. This is one of the few books I've wished I could un-read."
5,"Great taste, I was surprised it was this yummy!","The taste of this kettle corn is mildly sweet, not overpowering & not at all artificial-tasting. The product I tried was the 94%-fat-free KETTLE CORN, not to be confused with the Butter. The Kettle Corn has clear white kernals of popped corn, and there is not the first hint of yellow residue anywhere.The best feature: 94% fat-free! Although I am a bit confused and uncertain over what the actual fat content of a bag is (read the label of unpopped kernals v.s. popped corn--whaat?); as near as I can tell it is 2g of fat per popped bag, which yields approximately 3 cups of popped corn. Excellent! Since this is kettle corn, it is a great fix for a sweet tooth that also wants a crunchy snack. I was pleasantly surprised, & will have this in my cupboard 24/7 for those snack-attack moments without guilt. Definitely give this one a try!"
2,artificially sweetened...,"An unhappy surprise- from now on I will be reading the ingredients label for kettle korn. A little bit about my palette: I don't do diet sodas, stevia, or any type of low calorie beverages or products (except certain flavors of gum), because most artificial sweeteners leave an aftertaste in my mouth. If you enjoy diet sodas, crystal light drink powders and such, or have to use artificial sweeteners for health reasons- then maybe you will enjoy this popcorn. However, if you are looking for the type of kettle korn flavor and texture you get at the local fair- prepare to be disappointed. This does not have the caramelization crunch factor due to the artificial sweetener- which does not caramelize."
1,Sweetened with Sucralose,Real kettle popcorn is sweetened with sugar and is a real tasty snack.Unfortunately sugar burns in the microwave so Orville Redenbacher (ConAgra Foods) have sweetened this with sucralose.Sucralose is definitely something I wouldn't give to my kid. Read all about it online.
2,Try it before you buy a large quantity,"I bought three boxes of the Kettle Korn (""Slightly Swee & Slightly Salty"") flavor at my local grocery store. Nobody in my family likes this flavor at all. It's actually going into the trash, that's how bad it tastes.Our tastes may be different than yours, so go ahead and try it. Just don't buy a lot of it without trying it first."
1,The apple falls far from the tree,"I can only guess that youthful rebellion drove Carlton, whose dad is country music legend Charlie, to take up reggae. Inexplicably, he even sings in a Jamaican accent. This is pretty thin and embarrassing stuff: Carlton's voice couldn't be less distinctive; the cookie cutter songs are rarely more than half-written. There is little here to interest country or reggae fans."
4,Provocative Exegesis,"I find myself using this commentary during the A (Matthew) Cycle of the Lectionary. It is very enlightening and challenging. The author shows a remarkable familiarity with non-Gospel (especially Roman and Greek) sources which offer some perspective on the text. He also is continually exploring connections with the Hebrew Scriptures. The footnotes and bibliography show a familiarity with extremely wide and diverse sources. The theme of marginality comes through in many different ways. The Kingdom of Jesus is truly in opposition to the dominant Roman kingdom and those allied with it, Herod, the chief priests and the scribes. The subtitle of the commentary is ""A Sociopolitical and Religious Reading"". Both of these aspects are amply fulfilled. I would recommend this book highly."
5,blow to the head,"Shocking that only two reviews up for this. I suppose as most of the work from `Brass`(1971) onwards is gunning for bogus aesthetes, it is hardly pleasant to find it`s you, you media-produced swathe of complacent compliance. This kind of distance sets the chances of you aiming to interface with your own complicities - in what would no doubt have been a rather hit and miss affair - at next to zero. If you agree that looking gift horses in the mouth is hardly sensible, look this bunch of negativities in the teeth and see why you fail to agree to fail, want to understand what understanding might make untrue, or start wondering how contaminated your egotistical sublimation may actually have become, and ask what translates as the best thing to do about it. Bonne chance!"
4,A Good Basic Introduction,"This is a surprisingly useful book for being so small. Suzanne Swedo has over twenty years of experience as a teacher of outdoor survival skills. It shows.The author knows that most survival situations are resolved within 48 hours, so she concentrates on the issues that matter most during that time including signaling for help, staying adequately warm (fire, clothing, shelter), and how to keep yourself adequately hydrated. She also includes a useful list of equipment to take along and some good tips on what to do if you become lost.This book is small enough to take along with you out into the backcountry, but you might want to put it inside a plastic bag if you do so because (unlike some other survival manuals) it's not written on rain-resistant paper.This book does a good job of helping you to learn what you will need, how urgently you will need it, and how you could get it in an outdoor survival situation."
2,Too little information to be of significant value,"""Wilderness Survival"" is well written and an excellent book to motivate you to study further (and the author encourages this frequently), but as an instruction manual it is severely limited. Though you can't expect in-depth coverage of many different topics in a book so small, the author fails to cover any single topic adequately. She does provide a list of emergency equipment that would likely be helpful to those unaccustomed to wilderness environments, but overall the book doesn't provide sufficient information to justify its purchase."
4,Gently Hilarious,"Together won't shake the world, but I'll almost guarantee it will put an enormous on your face.One reviewer complained about the number of characters - but that's not only the charm of the movie - but its very premise! Certainly there is an amount of predictability but the cast is so into what they're doing that they are believable and work in true ensemble fashion.The soundtrack is an awful lot of fun (and sometimes ""awful"") and the secondary story involving the children and how they adapt to the wacky communal ideals of the adults is thought provoking. The film packs its message with little to no subtlety and none is desired or required here.As tasty as a Swedish Meatball!p."
2,Start Over Swede,"Routine tread through familiar territory. The camera work is not a pastiche of 70's photography, unless you seriously think every picture of that decade was directed by Micheal Winner. The photography is an entirely contemporary fad and an irritant.The ending. No, no, no."
5,Don't avoid this film just because it's about a commune,"Fun, light portrayal of a commune of left-wingers from an earlier time in history. Much better than I expected; a sleeper gem in many ways. A certain warmth is operative throughout. Without checking to be sure, I feel almost certain the writer was female. The characters evolve and change during the film in often surprising ways.I'm skeptical of the logic that shoves a film into a glbt ghetto, just because there are one or two gay characters. Most of the characters in this film are straight. But it can't be denied that this show will appeal to both communities, rather than just one or the other.I've yet to watch a Scandinavian film I didn't like. Where the French wax cynical and depressing, the Scandinavians have a certain optimism about human relations. I lump Norway, Finland and Sweden together because I haven't discerned any differences amongst them so far."
3,A film with a big heart.,"In Shakespearean comedies, there is often a green space, such as a forest, where characters exhausted or repressed by their society or culture come to rejuvenate themselves, or to be liberated. The 70s commune in 'together' performs a similar function - it is a refuge for misfits and the abused, but it is also a place where flawed people of good faith, such as the wife-beating husband, can try to transform. Conversely, the narrowly ideological and selfishly hypocritical are exposed and cast out.'Together' isn't quite as enjoyable as Moodysson's debut 'Show me love' - there are too many characters, not enough of them interesting or sympathetic - but the pastiche of 70s movie making, all murky colours and incessant zooming, is a delight, while the melancholy Abba music undercuts the optimism of this rememberance of times past."
3,Was it so good?,"This was a fairly good movie, but it is not a 5 star DVD. It is basically a story about aimless hippies in mid 1970s Sweden and their impractical solutions to their bizarre little problems."
2,Not strong enough,"It works fine in warm weather but not in cold.I've been expecting it to there for me when needed, but it did not have enough cold cranking amps. I had to call AAA even though I had this and it was fully charged.AAA uses 500 cold cranking amps with their unit, this has only 250."
3,Great Light Duty Glue Gun,"The cordless feature makes this glue gun very handy. Heat up time is 3 or 4 minutes, and the applicator puts out a nice fine line of glue.But, this is a light duty gun. Too much pressure on the trigger, in an effort to get a faster flow, has the effect of cooling the tip and stopping the flow for a second. Also, that same forcing of the trigger causes the advance mechanism to scrape the top of the glue stick and it won't advance at all till you ease up and slow down.Of course, if you are doing these things, you need a heavier duty glue gun. You can find them at www.glu-stix.com, all the way up to industrial strength with pnumatic force feeders.For most of us, and most of the tasks we want the glue gun for, this one is great.As a side note, the glu-stix.com site has bulk boxes of mini sticks, and special purpose glue sticks as well."
1,"Battery Always Dead - Should be Called a ""Poo Gun""","Like the others mentioned, I loved the idea of a cordless glue gun for tasks around the house, crafts, etc. Using this glue gun, however, has been nothing but frustrating. The battery dies in less than 15 minutes at full charge - even when we let it charge for hours. Becuase there is no way to power the gun via the AC outlet, your project has to stop and wait for over an hour before you get a few more minutes of juice. I thought maybe we got a bum unit, but seeing that someone else has had this exact problem suggests this is a common failure of this product. Stick with the tried and true, and avoid ColdHeat."
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"Other than the convenience factor, this glue gun is junk. The battery is already losing it's charging capacity, after only four months. I can barely use it for 30 minutes, without recharging. You can't buy a replacement battery at all yet, plus there is only a 90 day warranty. The time it takes to heat is longer than 5 minutes. Plus the trigger mechanism refuses to feed the stick most of the time. Save your $30 and buy something else."
1,Rotten Batteries,After a few months use the batteries quit charging. Good concept but lousy product. A waste of your money.
4,John Broadus knows his stuff...,"There are plenty of sermon preparation books out there, but this one is one that should be on the shelf of every pastor and deacon in the church. Also, Sunday School teachers would greatly benefit from this book in the preparation of exegetical teaching material. I recommend this book and think it will be beneficial to everyone who reads it."
4,A great reference source for ministers,I purchased thisOn the Preparation And Delivery of Sermonsbecause it was required reading for a Sermon Preparation class; it was used as a textbook. My instructor says it has been referred to for many years. I believe that any begginning minister will find this very valuable. It covers all areas of sermons and preaching.
3,Teaches morality... but at what cost,"I was ""The Idiot"" who was told to grab a novel to write a review for and happened to grab a book with a most suiting title. It teaches of the conflicts of one's self and morality, and how difficult it really is. It does this through Prince Myshkin and his illness as well as with the interaction amongst various other characters in the story. I do, however, have a problem with the length of the novel on a whole. But really, who am I to argue... I was the Idiot that picked it up when I clearly knew that I had ADD.Not recommended for people with ADD, ADHD, short attention span, short tempers, short term memory loss, and long term memory loss."
5,one of the best and most affecting books in the history.,"dostoyvsky is clearly, the most powerful and the most challenging novelist in the history. he sweeps the language and metaphor into a dangerous realm. readers could go insane reading this book, its so terrifyingly involving. myshkin is argued as jesus himself, with his lamblike innocence and the arrogance that comes with it. well, i found so mnay layers and so many meanings in the narrative, that i think only a great text could produce such range of emotions and thoughts. the text argues, fights, weeps, sulks, dreams and goes mad with you."
3,not my favourite: sometimes a bit boring,"I really like Dostoyevsky, but I consider 'The Idiot' a novel that sometimes gets too boring. It is magnificent the way Dostoyevsky portraits the Russian situation at the time, and Mishkin is really an interesting character, similar to my mind to Aliosha Karamazov. However, the book is, I think, unnecessarily enlarged, and gets stmes a bit dense and even boring. Maybe the next time i will like it best. Now I prefer 'Crime & Punishment' or 'The Brothers Karamazov', actually."
3,IT'S TOO BAD...,"I'd heard you were ""supposed to read this book"", and ""it's a classic"". So I went into it with open arms and to tell you the truth I loved Part 1. I couldn't put it down. Part 2 started to wane a little bit and by Part 3 I was forcing myself to go on. I've always felt that a great book, or a great movie should really leave you wanting more at the end, but with ""The Idiot"" that isn't the case. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Such a promising start, and such a dissapointing end.I think that because everyone says what a great book this is, we almost feel as if we too should think it's a great book. It's not. He's written much better stuff and so have other Russian authors."
1,Stupid,I hated this book. Whoever enjoyed needs a life. Read the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien is a fantasy God!!
4,A Tough One,"Dostoevsky's depection of the ""positively good man"" is much more fascinating, philosophically, than Crime and Punishment, but is also significantly harder to read. I suggest C&P instead, or the Brothers Karamazov if you have the time."
2,Pool time for toddler,"We purchased this float for our 20 month old daughter to use in the pool (the Rhino version is what was sent to us). It worked great but the area that your child will be sitting in is kind of wide. We certainly didn't plan on letting our little one float around freely but even holding onto it, if your toddler wiggles a lot, they can easily fall out.It worked, but is not the greatest. Kind of expected that for the price though ;)"
5,fantastic debut,A great debut record from a band who deserve a lot of attention. Buy this record twice.
4,Nelson + Ella=Magic,"This disc was one of two sessions that Ella Fitzgerald did with Nelson Riddle following their successful collaboration on the Gershwin Songbook. Though she does a nice rendition of ""Georgia On My Mind"", one can't erase Ray Charles' icon rendition of this rendition. The rest of the cuts are nice too and if you like this duo, do check it out."
5,musical giant,Ella shines in every way on this album and Nelson Riddle's arrangements and orchestra are impeccable. I have many of Ella's albums but this is one of my favorites. She is in her prime vocally and uses that incredible voice like one of the instruments reminiscent of the great jazz musicians. No wonder there are no female vocalists today that come close to this lady. She set a standard that can't be matched. And it is no wonder she and Sinatra loved to work with Nelson. He is in a catagory unto himself.
5,A Must-Have for Any Music Lover,"This has to be one of the best albums of all time. Her voice and his arrangements are compliment each other so well.It really is simply just ""that good""!"
2,NOT WORTH IT!,"I purchased this adding machine in Sept of 2008. Now here it is March 2010, Not even two years later, it is falling apart. It prints when I have it on no print. Does not always give the correct total.When I called Canon and told them, they said it only has a limited 1 year warranty. I was very pleasant to the rep when I asked if there was any other alternatives, and he said ""OH Well, nothing more I can do""I will not buy a Canon again!"
2,Pretty Stale,"The album is riddled with recycled and watered-down standup cliches (everything from a take on the long-ago cancelled Osbournes show to a six minute bit where he talks with a wacky Chinese accent). There are a few spots in which Kennedy shows promise of finding an original comedic voice, but it was obviously lost in the rush to get the album in stores while his show is still airing on MTV. It's worth one listen for a few solid bits ... but if you're looking to hear fresh takes the whole way through, then there are dozens of comics out there deserving to be looked at first."
3,"Meticulous, but missing something.","This is an exhaustively researched book, with interesting photos and all sorts of detail. But it was a little short of the one thing I thought it would be filled with, given the title: Life saving. There's very little in the way of actual tales of rescue, and almost none until the last quarter of the book. I would have preferred a little less day to day minutae and a little more adventure."
5,Great for professional writing,This book is great of professional writing tips. It is an easy read. Will help you write and get to the point.
2,Outdated,The book says almost nothing. It loses itself in too many words. Too many words and too little said. Maybe the part with the CV is more ok. Also the examples are poor.
3,Dont but kindle version of this book!!!,"If you really want to get 100% of this book, dont buy the kindle version. It is horrible and poorly formatted."
2,Very old fashioned,"I'm sure this was a great book at the time of publishing. But now, it's just very old fashioned.Many of the rules wouldn't applying these days, particularly on the web.I would have preferred a main focus on ""writing that works"", rather than a mix of different types of writing (letters, presentations, resumes, etc...). It doesn't cover any of those topics enough and you can definitely find online much better guides for each of them."
5,Keep this one on your desk - it works!,"In business, the adage holds - it's not always what you say but how you say it that counts. Writing That Works provides clear examples of how to write and communicate effectively and efficiently. This edition includes excellent tips on writing and controlling e-mail. Kudos to the author on his common sense advice to technical writers such as writing ""like you talk"" and skipping the latest business jargon. I keep this book on my desk as a reference guide and highly recommend this text to anyone in business, especially to those on my team!"
4,one extra star just for existing,"being a person with a casual interest in history (as opposed to a historian), it was nice to read something about nat turner. the book was short - 150 pages without the dreadful epilogue and another 50 or so pages of notes. it being short was ok, but it seemed to reflect a lack of information about the life of nat turner, and the events surrounding his rebellion. considering the amazing amount of prejudice that informs what information is available about nat turner's rebellion, the author does a good job of gathering sources. however, the author is all over the writing in a way that detracts from the history. he injects opinions and judgments. while i am not sympathetic to slaveholders, i do not need the author to speak pejoratively about them. their actions and words could do that for them. all in all, a good, quick read about a subject i've not not ever read much about. not a manual, however, for how to conduct a revolution..."
4,The Fire of Nat Turner,"This book is about the insurrection of Nat Turner against his slaveholder. This book is very good for a person who enjoys factual historical events about a slave striving for freedom. The book demonstrates the acts of the human spirit. It also shows the things Nat Turner did for freedom, however some of those acts were not becoming of a just person. Overall this is a great book that depicts the historical background of Nat Turner and his rebellion."
5,well written history of Turner's revolt,"I thought that this book (Kindle format) was an excellent account of the event. The author's narrative style made it an easy read despite it's complicated topic. The author's use of detail combined with concise analysis also was impressive. It was also even-handed in its approach to the topic of Turner's rebellion as well as the institution of slavery. I completely agree with an earlier reviewer of this book - if you want to understand the 19th century South, and the Civil War, and the current day South, this book should be read. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this event and Southern history. Finally, the details of the events are sickening and disturbing, and we owe much thanks to the author for telling this story, as this history should not be repeated."
5,The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner's Fierce Rebellion,"This is my first experience buying online books and it will not be the last one. The book came in good conditions. Without scharts, nothing writing in it, and it was like new!"
5,Smooth Rootsy Soul,"This is an album that seems to get better with every play. Definitely better than his first two albums (although they are definitely worth picking up), more polished and tighter musicianship. The songs range from heavy soul to a more americana rootsy vibe. Dont dismiss this at first listen, Jonah has a unique sounding voice that trust me... grows on you with each listen. Well written songs and great music!! Something thats increasingly rare these days. Excellent album, lets hope he gets solid backing so he can make some more!!"
4,Cool Blue Breeze,"Heard 'My Morning Scene' on a local indie radio station (it's too good for Clear Channel). As it was not identified, spent several days tracking down artist to find this wonderful album. The aforementioned song reminded me of The Band and brilliant songwriter Malcolm Holcombe - and I got a major kick out of finding Garth Hudson playing on a song and Jonah covering Malcolm's 'Dressed In White'. The CD is an understated joy - wrapped in moody melodicism and thoughtful lyrics. Jonah's voice has real character (despite the lame description by the Amazon reviewer) and his emotional commitment to the songs is palpable.My only small quibble (and reason for 4 starts) is the sameness of many of the tunes and that the production is flat - plodding, where it needs to push.That aside, this is a rare gem in a sea of sound-alikes."
5,Get it,"While going to see Susan Tedeschi in concert last fall, we were treated to an opening act that we had never heard of. The sound that Jonah Smith put out immediately grabbed our attention (we usually don't pay a great deal of attention to opening acts), and we immediately went to meet him and get some CD's. I bought 3 copies, gave two away and kept one that Jonah autographed for me. Upon listening to the CD, I was highly impressed that the sound that captivated us from the life performance was captured on the CD. The sound is very soulful, with definate influences from The Band and Van Morrison.As for the CD, this is solid from cover to cover. There is not a single track on this disk that I don't like (which I can rarely say for ANY CD), and the disc keeps finding its way back into my CD player."
5,This is feel good rocking blues,"During live concert tours Jonah travels in good company, ie Jonny Lang. In this case the promoters made a good match. Excellence inspires excellence. If you ever hear Jonah in a comparison to Van Morrison just listen to ""Everything is new again"" and you will understand. Jonah says he is like a sponge and that is reflected in his style. Madeleine Peyroux, Regina Spector, The Band, those are good things to sponge up.Of course just when you think you have him defined, he hits you with something like ""Open up the door"", (see his MySpace page)which is more like the Beatles' ""She came in thru the bathroom window"", especially with the background harmonies.""When we say goodnight"" is almost a party anthem, where the horns and the bass give the bluesy tune a get up and move dance attitude. My favorite song."
3,"3++ Still know nothing more about this guy, than this is a fine singer/songwriter disc.","3++ Still know nothing more about this guy, than this is a fine singer/songwriter disc."
4,Well written but extensive math knowledge required,"This book was ""meant to be an introductory text to the field of Cybernetics"" according to the author. In my opinion, it is targeted to the educated lay reader. A Bachelor of Science is required to absorb 100% of the reading material. Having a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, I am forced to skip all the mathematical equations(which sometimes goes on for pages on end). The author, Norbert Wiener, has a knack for explaining the wonders of physics, time, and quantum mechanics in verbose. I'm sure his mathematical proofs on time series are brilliant, if I only understood advanced math. I'm not going to hold my lack of knowledge against the guy, but I can only give it four stars for being unable to absorb the entirety of the book. I feel that if a book is dense in mathematics, there should be some kind of forewarning to the reader, which is why I knocked off a star. Still recommend it to that B.S graduate though!"
3,difficult read,"it took a fairly major effort to read this one. the texts are hard enough to understand with ancient language (its hard to find people talking about ""computing machine"" nowadays). Lots of math appears in this book, and there certainly they are not step-by-step. This is basically for people with a good intuitive grasp of the underlying mathematics or else there is no chance you can follow it. The style of writing also seems foreign to me (21 years old). But very insightful book with good rewards, but I still feel that I spent a disproportional amount of effort for the reward that I get."
1,Useless Strategy Guide !,"This guide was a disapointment. It only gives generic information about the game. I was looking for tips on all of the car setups. Drivetrain, suspension, etc.. Nothing there. Even though the book (used) was cheap, it still was a waste of money."
4,Cheap is Good!,Cheaper by the Dozen is a good book for all kinds of ages. It shows the love and care between the Gilbreth family. They show the love between one another and never fight among each other. They work hard and are very talented in school. This book is very well written and I enjoyed reading it. The only downside was that it was focused on the father only and not any of the other family members got much attention. Overall it was great and I give the book four golden stars!
5,Alot of Kids,"I am eleven years old. I loved this book because I like kids. I liked how they used efficency to ,ake the family run smoothly. The day Mr. Gilbreth died Junr 14 was when I had a surgery. My mom read the book when she was a kid and so dod my substitute teacher. I am trying to find the video. I have the audio version and the sequel. I am a big fan. It is set in an interusting time peirod. I loved it when he called the canarys Shut Up and You Heard Me. Also when he taught the kids Morse Code and... Oh I loved it all. You shuld read it it is a fun book!"
2,little to much cussing for young listeners,"Checked this out in my local library and funny enough it was in the children's section. We had listen to it before but our old radio would fade in and out while we listen to it painting. So, later when we had the chance again (now it was found in the adult section) so this time we would listen to it in the car, I was a bit shocked at the language on it. Even my 11 year old stated there was a *allot of cussing* on this tape. The stories are funny enough without the hard language. This tape/cd has no rating on it. It should be at least PG-13 to give parents a heads up for a younger listeners."
3,Didn't appeal to me,"I'm more into a different genre than this book. I thought it was really really boring. It probably didn't appeal to me because I don't have 11 siblings or 12 children and because it was set at a totally different time than I can relate to. Hardly anyone anymore has 12 kids! I thought that the parents had good intentions for having a big family, but to put that kind of pressure on them to skip school and hope that your younger sibling didn't skip to your grade wasn't the best idea."
2,Language problem on cassette,"I loved this movie as a child and thought my six year old and I would listen to the book on cassette. I was not prepared, nor did I remember, the use of language in the movie. The third time I heard the Lord's name taken in vain, I turned the cassette off. I am going to buy the book and read it to my son, skipping those parts. I guess when I watched the movie (many moons ago) that language was not allowed on television and therefore we were not subjected to it. I was very disappointed in the book on tape. The story is wonderful. The authors (two of the children) could have alluded to the language without repeating it. I rate it two stars because of this."
3,No So Cheap,The book was entertaining and heartfelt. I gave only three stars because I feel very strongly about overpopulation being a global epidemic. Still it is worh reading.
4,This book was hilarious!,"This book was great!! We read it for 8th grade Language arts, and I absolutely loved it! It is very funny, and the stuff that happens is so wacky that you have to remind yourself that this is a true story. I would Definatley reccommend this book!!"
5,"Cheaper by the Dozen, yeah right","I really enjoyed this book. It is the humorous story of a mother and father, who is a motion study expert. Together they raise a dozen children. It has funny anecdotes about their real life and all the crazy things they do. The father is always testing his motion study on the kids, and what happens is always hilarious. It also tells about their maritime adventures every summer in Nantucket. Though this family goes through many scrapes and quarrels, they are resilient and always persevere.I love this book and would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor wishing for a funny book. This book dominates my top ten list of books."
4,Cheer for Cheaper by the Dozen,"Cheaper by the Dozen, by Frank B. Gilbreth, is an excellent book because is makes people who read it laugh. For example, one time father yells at the people on the sidewalk and calls them funny names. The reason this is so funny is because you don't often see grown men yelling at each other in public. Then there is the time that Lillian bobbed her hair on her own. This is funny because the results are disastrous. This book should be read by all middle-schoolers who enjoy a good laugh."
5,A really good book.,"This is a really good book. I have had the same copy since I was 11 yeas old and I am now 24. I have the hardcover edition first printing in 1948. The only problem with it is that it skips around one chapter will be when the children are older and the next seems like it is from a few yeas before. It is about a family of 12 children the father is an effencicy expert and the mother a psycologist. There are six boys and six girls. it is fun to read about their adventures and the way their father taught them. The book ends when the father dies. I have never read the second book ""With belles on their toes"" but I would like to. --sorry about the spelling."
5,A GREAT AND FUNNY BOOK!!!,THIS BOOK WAS THE FUNNIEST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. IT WAS SO INTERESTING TO READ ABOUT A FAMILY OF A DOZEN CHILDREN. ALL THAT I COULD SAY THAT THIS BOOK WAS FUNNY AND CREATIVE.
5,A hilarious heart-warming classic guarantees a laugh!,"This is by far the best book I have ever read and couldn't recommend it more! Not only did it keep me chuckling throughout, I found myself in awe and amazement at the routines of a large family and the concept of ""time-management""! Truly a classic that will suit all ages."
5,i loved this book!!!!,"I thought this book was full of excietment and fun to read a real thriller!!!! It got you on the edge of your set and kept on hanging!!!! I will read this to my kids and I am sure they will love it just as much as I did the first time I read it. I wish every one felt the way I did and would scroll up and by this book, not because I told you or someone else but because you want to share the wise teaching this book has to offer. Don't let this book pass you by!!! So buy it today!!!"
5,A charismatic read.,"""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is a book full of warmth, love, admiration, and grief. A warning: this is nothing like the 2003 movie ""Cheaper by the Dozen."" The only common theme is the 12 children. This story will remind you of your childhood days, if you grew up in a large family, or will remind you of one of your parents (or just make you yearn for a large family). Told in a random autobiographical format, you'll be taken through certain highlights of this family's life. What makes it a bigger treasure is that it is told by two of the Gilbreth children. If you're a fan of ""Life with Father,"" then you'll love this story. It's a snappy read, and one that should be read together by families. The last chapter is sad, and a depressing note to end on. Nonetheless, the entire time you're reading this book, you'll have a smile on your face, and a few laughs. I recommend."
5,Excellent read for anyone,"Non-fiction is a category with very few books I would recommend that everyone read. Usually, the topics are tied too closely to interests. I think that this is one of the few books that is actually of general interest.Frank Gilbreth Sr. was the sort of over-the-top character you could imagine would invent a new field, and so he did. Motion study, and industrial engineering owe him a lot. His wife and he were an excellent team who innovated the way people work.The book takes great pains to explain the factors that made their family unique, from size to father and mother. All sorts of bizarre and funny moments are recorded within. Personality of the players is excellently displayed in the various events.If you want a peep into another era and culture, or just some humorous anecdotes, this book is excellent. If you are entering the workforce, you might find some excellent time-saving tips in there as well. This is simply one of my favorite books."
4,Fun for all ages,"While some might consider ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" to be a children's book, I found it funny and interesting as well. As an only child, it was bewildering to even consider the idea of such a large family! In addition, I loved the father's motion study antics. Recommended for anyone seeking a lighthearted but worthwhile read."
1,Horrible!,"If you enjoy a read that will leave you depressed and unfulfilled on every level, ths book is for you! An unhappy ending is one thing but an unhappy ending for every character is just awful."
5,Suspense and Shines,"Known to all as George Eliot's greatest creation, it's no wonder when you start reading from page one to the last. Through and through the power and spirit of the story is astounding, and a the end just shocks and volts one.While many authors go and create a happy ending just to satisfy readers and keep them as THEIR readers, Eliot did something unexpected, and aparently few people know how to appreciate such a different and original outcome. Life isn't always full of happy endings, but the eternal binding of brother and sister is true and touching."
4,A great novel which sadly falls at the last hurdle.,"It begins with the satire and light-heartedness of a Dickens novel, which is gradually consumed by the emotional intensity and confusion characteristic of Austen, but sadly it never reaches the tragic depths of ' Anna Karenina', which in my opinion it so despretly wants. Because of this, it fails to find it's way and gets hoplessly lost in the third section, with unnecessary plot twists. Nonetheless, Elliot paints a real and beautiful scene of rural life wich is unsurpassable, but is let down by a dodgy climax, a shame for us and shameful for her."
4,Another Eliot winner.,"The truly amazing thing about George Eliot is her ability to make readers not just care, but actually ache for the characters in her novels. The tale of Maggie Tolliver has to be one of the most gut-wrenching in the whole of English literature. Unlike earlier reviewers, I found her trials totally believable, given the time in which she lived -- a time when women had absolutely no rights and were generally at the mercy of their fathers, brothers and husbands. I did not find the fact that Maggie's sense of duty, honor and decency forbade her from eloping with her cousin's fiancé the slightest bit implausible. What is sad is that modern-day readers mistake her nobility for ""wimpishness."""
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I have been promising myself for years that I would read some of the works of authors like Thomas Hardy and George Eliot. I started out by purchasing Mill on the Floss and was interested in reading about Maggie, her brother, and their relatives. I was very amused as the book progressed and the author, in a very subtle way, described Maggie's aunts and uncles in their narrow-mindedness and snobberies. Somewhere about the time that Maggie ran off and was taken in by gypsies, I became very bored and have not finished the book. I will probably pick it up again and fast-read to the end but I am not in a hurry to do this. The fault is in me, not in the book. In this day and age we readers are used to fast action and it is hard to stick with a slow-moving book like this.Perhaps I will edit this review after I finish the book--which I will do at some time."
3,Maggie and Tom,I enjoyed the humor of the book but I didn't find Maggie the strong character that she's supposed to be. She's far too dependent on her brother for her own good.
2,"Ok, but long!","The story I find quite ok and kind of exiting at times...but George Eliot could have written this book in 200 pages, not 500 (the paperback edition). At times she really creats a great atmosphere with her long explainations and detail descriptions, for an example is her description of the town St. Ogg. But generally her descriptions are way to long and that gave me the feeling that she was trying to hard to create some atmosphere. She simply over did it! If you have enough time and litle pacience I can recomend this read. I will probably hesitate alitle before I read George Eliot again! Arni"
1,Dull...,"The story of a woman that does not know what she wants. Boring, decidedly too long and with a detestable, foolish heroine. Why did Eliot wish to torture her readers?"
4,"Nicely written, but a bit boring at times","I had to read Mill on the Floss for school, and although I thought it was wonderfully written, I found it hard to identify with Maggie. Her blind love for Tom was understandable to a point, but today's woman would most likely not put up with his scorn and narrow-mindedness. If you don't enjoy reading lengthy sentences chalk full of descriptions, I would not recommend this book. On the other hand, if you like that kind of slow, but interesting reading, you will Mill on the Floss."
4,Wonderfully Evolved,"This is a marvelous study of a character -- George Eliot was a genuine craftswoman -- you cannot help but feel her love for her characters, nor can you help delighting in the way she so finely sculpts them into souls. The story gives us a wonderful heroine - Maggie - and we feel her struggles and her passions. We see her evolve upon her very human path -- we come to love her family and friends, even with their faults. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel - even though it bogged itself down in spots - it was worth trudging through. The ending is beautifully written. I had tears streaming down my face - it was so moving."
5,almost perfect,"This novel begins with an excellent exmaination of childhood and introduces us to a brother and sister who really don't know each other in some fundamental ways. Maggie is a girl with depth and true character and her brother simply considers her rebellious. The novel is a fascinating look at an insular world, social constraints and the place of Woman. I found the family discussions comic and truthful, and Maggie's later struggles very real. The ending left me tired and feeling somewhat manipulated . . .but also weeping. Truly great."
5,super!,I find this CD to be of good quality and Well presented. Good country music all the way I Love it.
4,Live at Billy Bob's Texas,Merle's band sounds much better live than in studio.The solos are much longer and vibrant on this disc. A must have for Merle fans.
4,Arguably the most famous live performance in jazz.,"This is arguably the most famous live performance in jazz, and with good reason. This is Ella at her peak. Arriving in Berlin, performing at the Deutschlandhallen, this album runs the full dynamic gamut. On the one hand, it contains a subtle ""Summertime"" where her melodic embellishments are absolutely inspired. But then Ella, now in the home of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, decides to fill the set with ""Mac the Knife,"" recently made a hit by both Bobby Darrin and Louis Armstrong. When the words come unraveled before her, her improvisation is awe-inspiring. This is directly followed with the definitive live ""How High the Moon,"" complete with an 8 minute scat that is unequalled. This reissue is somewhat marred by the presence of two tracks mistakenly thought to have been part of the performance, but which are of a noticeably different character. Nonetheless, amazing."
5,Sublime is the Word.,"From ""Lady is A Tramp"" to ""How High the Moon"" to her unique improvisation on ""Mack the Knife""...Miss Ella Fitzgerald shows us that she is the jazz vocalist genius of all time. Sublime, Brilliant, Legendary...this album captures it all. A must for any Ella fan and every jazz fan."
5,Live in Las Vegas,It's interesting..but truly wonderful to hear Judy Garland with Lucky Day. Sound is great. Wish a CD with just her from her Las Vegas show would become available.
4,White Feather/Classic 50's Western,"This is a classic 50's Western that only recently came out on DVD and could only be seen for years on AMC. Stars a very young Robert Wagner, Debra Paget, and Jeff Hunter, Debra and Jeff playing Native Americans. Good story, somewhat hokey acting, but overall still very entertaining."
3,"Good, but...","It does exactly what it says. you can browse and save your phone files (pictures, recorded sounds, Bluetooth acquired files) to your PC. You can also update the firmware with ""Sony Ericsson Update Service"". It can charge your phone but you need a charger connected to the dock for this.Now the bad part, it broke after just weeks of use and I didn't treat it harshly. It's just not working anymore and there's no sign of broken parts. Good while it lasted is all I can say. As with all electric devices, you can have better luck."
4,Excellent,This book inadvertently reveals what it takes for boys to grow into men! The book is well written and enjoyable as it inspires.
3,Pricey magnesium,"It was suposed to be a cleanser. It didn't work for me, as I have problems magnesium alone won't solve. I could not tell the difference between this and a bottle of magnesium I purchased from WalMart. This is my personal experience; I would still encourage people who think it might work to give it a try, as it might work for them."
1,Did not work for me,I did not find that it helped remove toxins which is what I was hoping it would do. It did loosen the bowel.
3,"Good Cleanse, Howver, Contains Rice Flour","This product gives a good cleanse. The only drawback is that it contains rice flour. For most, this won't be a problem. For those on low carb and gluten free diets, it's a problem."
5,"Wonderful product, everyone that I have recommended it to loves it!!!!","Great product, came just as described. Needed it for HCG Diet. Perfect and Effective. 2-3 pills at night, and flushes out your system quickly and effectively. Have recommended it to a few friends and no one has anything negative to say. Would definitely recommend to anyone that needs it!!! U will not regret it!"
5,Concise meditations & profound insights will inspire souls,"Against the background of contemporary misunderstandings of God and Christian revelation, it is gratifying to see how a modern Scripture scholar, Professor Scott Hahn, contributes concise and profound insights into the most familiar prayer in all history, the Lord's Prayer. His meditations, enriched by covenant theology, will inspire souls with greater knowledge and love of God, and will stimulate in them a greater zeal to spread Christ's Kingdom, the Church, on earth. Readers victimized by a spiritually decadent culture to ignore their supernatural destiny are reminded, ""If He who was without sin prayed, how much more ought sinners to pray."" The value of this volume is enhanced by inclusion of the texts of timeless commentaries on the Lord's Prayer by Sts. Cyprian, Cyril of Jerusalem, John Chrysostom, and Augustine."
5,"Understanding ""Our Father""","This is a wonderful book for those looking to deepen thier faith. It is an excellent follow up to the book 'Left To Tell' since the Our Father is the prayer that brought her through her ordeal in Rowanda. Worth every penny of the earthly price...priceless for someone on a journey towards eternity!Understanding ""Our Father"": Biblical Reflections on the Lord's Prayer"
5,Great Fun!,My 4 year old got this for his birthday party a few weeks ago. It has been his favorite toy. The plyers it comes with are ideal for little hands and after awhile little supervision is needed. He has come up with some pretty neat creations. Really instills creative play.
3,I got it ..!,I was sent a wrong one first but after a week or so I got a new one..the right one this time and I like it a lot.
4,For pop punk fans and collectors,"This is really a pretty cool cd! Let the samples speak for themseleves, that's why I ordered this bad boy. The only real drawback is that it kind oof drags on in the middle. Songs like ""Alien"", ""Go Ahead, Punk"", ""Surfin Seasick"", and Billy Joel's ""The Longest Time"" make this cd a real pleaser for pop punk fans Especially if they surf! And hey, it's rare! Be the first on your block to own ""Return of the Helicopter Man"""
1,One for the ages,"My mother bought a copy of this self-published book directly from the author, who was selling them door-to-door back around the time I was born. She did it out of pity, the moreso (as she later realized) after she started reading it. I tried reading it in my early teens, and tried again in my late teens, and I think I actually gave it another glance a few years ago when visiting my parents. (They've kept every book they've ever bought, including the 1967 set of Encyclopedia Brittanica.)I am sure that there are worse books, but in terms of painfully stilted dialog, this sets a standard that is hard to beat. It is bad enough that, read aloud properly to an audience that has already started drinking, it could be hilarious."
5,GREAT!,"I have been an AVAIL fan for about 10 years now, and I must say to everyone else that is comparing this album to Over The James..... This album is different. Period. Each album that AVAIL puts out has the same flow to it, just with a different style. You can not compare one album to the next. So in that case One Wrench is one amazing and awesome album that has perfect hooks and grabs you right away. Never has a band been able to pull off what AVAIL pulls off on a daily basis. Of course this compares not to their awesome live performance!"
5,"The good, the bad, and the new Avail cd","I have to say, I absolutely love this album, even in it's semi-mediocre tracks. Avail has always been one of the best bands to ever come out of anywhere, with albums like 4 a.m. Friday, Dixie, and Over the James being among the best in my collection. This album, with Avail on Fat Wreck, has a few tracks that to me are just cookie cutter Fat Wreck tracks. The first track for instance, replaced Tim with the lead's from Strung Out or Good Riddance, it could be any of their songs... but oh well, maybe I'm just getting old... notable tracks on this cd, ALL THE EVEN NUMBERED ONES... great, great Avail... go buy it, shut up."
4,AVAIL ABLE ESSENTIALS (get it? it's a pun!),it's funny how all these reviews are like 'one wrench' is not as good as 'over the james'. i remember when 'over the james' came out and everyone was like it's not as good as '4am friday'. why can't everyone just appreciate each record as a good album that doesn't need to be ranked? can't we be happy that they have made 3 great albums for us. get all three! and if you like them get 'dixie'. you can live w/out 'satiate' which has it's moments and i don't know i kinda did not like 'front porch stories'. but hey i didn't like it... but i still think avail is great and am glad they've given me 4 albums i love!
2,Dull...Not Ella's Best!,"When I first bought this CD back in November, I showed it to my dad. He said he thought that it didn't look very good. He was right. Of the 15 tracks on this album, the only two good ones are ""When Your Lover Has Gone"" and ""Love me or Leave Me."" The rest of the numbers are flat, and are not very up-tempoed. Also, the CD has very poor packaging, and looks like they were in a hurry to sell them in record stores. So, Ella fans all over the world-that's you!!!-beware of this CD!"
1,Brotherhood of Betrayal,"I also thought this was a ""new"" book by Randall Arthur. I anxiously awaited its arrival only to discover this is the same book as ""Betrayal"" which I had previously read. I don't know who is responsible for this real act of betrayal--the author, the publisher, or Amazon. In my opinion, when a book is resold with a different cover and name, it should be clearly stated that this is the same book previously titled as whatever the original title was. I feel swindled by all transgressors noted: the author, the publisher, and Amazon."
4,touchy subjects,"Yes, the story does pack a punch, and it is one of those books you have to stay up half the night to finish. The last reviewer already covered the positive side, and I agree with most of it. On the other hand, I found this book to be a little heavy on stereotypes, particularly in its portrayal of Fundamentalist Christians. I would not describe myself as a Fundamentalist, but I know many people who would, and they would be absolutely appalled by the behavior of the Fundamentalists in this story. Still, if legalism like this does exist, this book does a good job of pointing to a clear alternative in the liberty of Christ. This is a book will stimulate serious thought, and make a deep impression on the reader. It would also be good material for a study group discussion."
4,A Good read,"I was blown away when I read ""Wisdom Hunter"" so I had high expectations for this book. This book is very disturbing and shocking. I definitely think that Christian churches do have a problem with ""shooting their wounded"" rather than coming along side of them.Overall, I don't think this book is anywhere near as good as Wisdom Hunter. Still, if you are looking for a quick read that will make you think, this would be a book for you."
2,A Thesaurus Won't Kill You,"This book had a huge ""What the heck?"" factor in it. The romantic aspects of the book were completely unbelievable, especially when taken in context with the time period. I can usually get some small bit of enjoyment out of LLM's novels, but this was not one of them.Also, if you could please, for the love of God and everything holy, find a synonym for ""presently"" that would be amazing. Said the reviewer. She has hair of chestnut and hazel eyes. Presently, she felt the urge to inform the reader that what they were reading was happening now, and not five minutes ago. She then decided to awkwardly tack on unnecessary descriptions in places where they don't fit."
2,Good. But there are better.,"This is a good academic review of nonprofit integrations. But it focuses too much on larger NGOs. Somewhat dry, it could benefit from conversational appraisals by those actually involved in these alliances. For better insight, try Strategic Planning for Nonprofit Corporations, Second Edition."
1,From Alice to Ocean,"Love the book and the photos. The big disappointment is the DVD which can only be played on a MAC, which I don't own. That's the reason I only gave it one star."
3,Black Dice Belly Ring,This is a pretty good design and it doesn't hang too far down. After a couple weeks though the dice did actually come loose and I had to superglue the dice back onto the bar. Other than that it is very pretty and I like the little sparkles on the dice.
5,Billy Exstien,Have been looking for him for years. Love his voice an interpretations. Great sound and bavkground. Saw him years ago in person with Jan B the ine that shouldn't have gotten away!
4,very new york,I got this watch for my girlfriend's son for his 9th birthday because they had just moved to new york. He loves the watch.
3,good but expected more,"Expected more from Thomas Howell, but it was a simple story line. I expect alot more but it was OK."
4,Pure Death Metal!,"Personally, I found the spoken intros funny. Anyway, this band doesn't redefine the genre in any way but it does produce some ass-kicking balls out death metal. The vocals are evil, the riffs are brutal, and the drummer is incredible on some of his fill-ins and things. Also the cover of ""War Machine"" by Kiss at the end rocks."
3,not so great...,"i thought it was gonna be a really cool game with a good story... but no... it sucks. it was kinda interesting but i was bored throughout the entire game!the graphics were ok...the gameplay really sucks!, the story is rather dull, the music isn't that good, and the replay value is terrible!all you do is click!!! you don't get to do anything else!!! if you like that, well, you might like this... but if your like the rest of the world, i would recommend getting a more awesome game... like oblivion, timeshift, devil may cry, or even spellforce!believe me, i've played alot of games... and this isn't a good one :("
4,it's ok,I've read so many good reviews about this game.But I like Dreamfall better this one was to short.
2,Just didn't care for it.,"I played a couple of adventure games (Syberia and another one I don't recall) and I got really enthralled by this game genre, so, based on everyone's review, I got this one.Technical issues aside, I just couldn't get drawn into it. The story is too new-agey, too ""evil white males vs pure frolicking happy people"", etc etc. I just couldn't get to care for the main character, for the plot (I found myself rooting for the bad guys), and would get annoyed at the choices I was given.After enduring the first chapter, I had enough and uninstalled it.The graphics (dated, but good) and execution (didn't encounter a single bug) save this one from a 1 star rating."
2,"Appropriate, really.","The Longest Journey. Aptly named.When I finished gameplay, I snapped the disc in two and tossed it. Not worth the $9.99 I payed for it."
3,Great Story,"This game has a great story, its the only reason i wanted it, but the puzzles are very hard and I had to use my best friend, the internet, to walk threw the game"
3,A Retro Romp,"I enjoyed this game. It's graphics and gameplay are old compared to today's, but it is entertaining. I could figure out most of the problems after a couple of hours. It also lets you appreciate how far gaming has come in a few short years. I usually go for the FPS type of games and sometimes need a break. This game is great to sit back, have a cold one, and go on a little trip without stressing out. I recommend it. Good, old fashioned fun."
3,Did not like the game,"Unfortunately, I played Syberia I and II before this game and found it to be too confusing. Yes, there are a lot of options at each level, but that in itself made it hard to move forward. I had to constantly rely on cheat books to find out which way to head my character. Perhaps I am not sharp enough to play a game of this caliber, but I found the style of the Syberia series much easier to deal with."
2,so so game,"I found this game to be a bit disappointing. There is a lot of dialogue to sit through and i found myself anxious to begin some game play. I also needed to download a patch in order for the game to stop locking up during play. In addition, there seems to be a glitch in loading a saved game. I need to start a new game and load from there."
4,Long live to Thrash Metal!!!,"This is a great band and I never imagined that they will have a Live DVD, this is a great oportunity to see them in action. I'm waiting for the 7 dates of Hell ( VENOM ) , the new DVD from Nuclear Assault and the new DVD from Metal Church!!!! this is a great Thrash/Black Metal Year!!!"
4,a lost masterpiece,"The NYRB lost classics series strikes gold again-- a rich, masterful, deeply authentic journey through prison life in the 1960s. With arresting imagery, and captivating characterization, Braly, himself a long-time con, leads us on a labyrinthine tour of the world behind the walls. His powers of empathy render every character as a tormeted, struggling, human soul."
5,Excellent fantasy farce,"A terrific book that plays upon the stereotypes of pulp fantasy. I highly recommend this book! Find a copy, even if it's used; you'll enjoy it."
1,0 stars,"bad bad very bad.It's not rapid, and it does nothing for acne, it doesn't even moisturize. I used it religiously for at least 2 weeks. Nothing. I ended up throwing it away.Don't buy any of the rapid clear products from Neutrogena is all I can say."
2,No,No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no! Does not work. Do not buy. Warning warning danger danger. If you are looking into this thing as an old school styling method forget about it. I tried it and it does nothing you think it will. Vitalis does not work in any way and it smells terrible. Go buy some styling gel instead as this product will not re-create a retro look at all.
3,Heart of Darkness,This book had many writings and notes it it. I havn't read it yet so I don't know if I will like it. It is for a class so I have to read it!
1,Hated it!,"This book is so over-rated. Unless you are some type of literature major, this book is boring, difficult to read - meaning it just doesn't flow well. Oh the horror, the horror..."
5,Awesome book,"Although English was not his initial language, I think that had it been, Conrad would have wielded much the same command of the language as Shakespeare in his day. But regardless of the writing quality, this is also a gripping and mesmerizing story. Perhaps some of this is because Conrad used to be in the same line of work as the main character, Marlow, who recurs in many of his works, but this story delves far beyond mere personal reflections, dealing with far more difficult and weighty issues than, say, Anna Karenina, and even many of the plays of Shakespeare; But, for me, the story is nevertheless as thrilling as any modern day mass-market novel, if not more because of its superior writing and philosophical quality. My favorite sections are Part 2, and the final scene, so don't give up early. I would give this six stars if I could. This is not my favorite edition, but the one I read first."
3,"Great space saver, poor quality construction","I love the retractable cables and the great adapter selection, but the ""retractor"" for the mike and headphones broke open the first time I used it. It is made very cheap, so I am very careful with the others."
4,The Chick Corea Trio,"I'm a big fan of Chick Corea's fusion days. I love most of his Elektric Band stuff, and most stuff he put out between 1974-1992.This album has great players on it; Steve Gadd on drums and Eddie Gomez on bass. I love both of them. And they were Chick Corea regulars around this time.This album has some great tunes, like Lenore. One of the greatest Corea tunes I ever heard. But then, there are some boring tracks without drums, or Chick is using a vocalist.Now I'm not a vocals fan, so mainly when a jazz musician uses vocals for a recording or two, I look in the other direction, but this album has enough good material to over-shadow the bad stuff. Still worthy of getting; make your own opinion about it.Great playing!"
5,Most Musical of Chick's Fusion Age,"This is quite possibly the best lineup chick ever worked with during his fusion experimentation. Every musician in the group has something unique to say, and the phenomenal compositions of Corea stand unmatched in the realms of imagination and awareness of the many musical elements. Steve Gadd has a language of his own, and speaks it through this music. He has very unique interpretations and can see right through conformity to true pulse, and also create amazing grooves felt on a higher level than most. While I respect everything Chick did under different lights, I think this was his ""best of the 70's"" (to be blunt). A must have for fusion listeners."
2,MP3 album MISSING a song,"Beware - the MP3 album of ""The Leprechaun"" is missing the last song! Actually, it's the second half of the last song (""Leprechaun's Dream, Part 2""). Not there. Amazon has said they will investigate the problem, but we'll see if they ever get around to fixing this. They were gracious enough to refund my money, but I'd rather have the missing track!"
2,Enough Already!!!!!,"Chick Corea was going through a bizzare,Scientology-induced musical madness at this point.Aside from the frantic funk-fusion of ""Nite Sprite"" the gimmicky syntheisizers usedin playing them other songs fall embarrasingly flat.Okay stuff for Corea to do with acoustic intruments but he has a far too mechanical way with electric keyboards and doesn't tend top convay the genuine feeling,warmth or color this material deserves or that he's noted for with them.He similarly hamperedthe musical progress of Return To Forever (see reviews) so wehave Chick Corea-brilliant jazz pianist-below average electrickeyboard interpretor.I do however welcome any opinion that differs because that is the problem with first impressions-youonly get to make one."
5,"The best air bed, period.","This is a quality product that will last for many years. We use it for overflow guests, and everyone who has slept on it has remarked how comfortable it is. Our granddaughters prefer it to a real bed, taking turns controlling the electric pump until it is just right. I highly recommend this bed."
2,Developed a slow leak after a few months,"It was great for awhile!!! Too bad I cannot find the leak. Now what do I do?Wasted $100! I put it on top of my old mattress, so why the leak? Just spent athousand on a new mattress set. Shoulda just got a latex topper for under $200.Oh well.Jan"
4,Highly convienient but hold your nose,"This little bed is just a great stand-by to have ready for guests. It comes with a stuff sack, fleece cover, repair kit and integral pump which'll get the bed up and ready in next to no time. With Prime, I had this delivered next-day (Saturday) for very little extra which meant I didn't have to buy it on the off-chance of having guests just turn up :)Once pumped, the bed is pretty stable and importantly stays that way all through the night unlike other brands I've tried in the past.The only reason not to give this 5 stars is the horrid chemical/plastic off-gassing that lasted for the entire week of our first use (and likely still exists although now its contained within its storage bag)"
3,Magic Wand Review,I purchased this wand for my son for his Halloween costume. Very sturdy product. However in the image it shows the wand in a package. I recieved this product in just the enevlope. It was NOT in a plastic package. I could have been sent a used magic wand.
2,Disappointing Christmas gift,"I bought this along with a magic set for two of my grandchildren, but neither seemed interested, and I found them lying around the house several times. They seemed to understand what it represented, but they just didn't connect it with their play with the magic set."
4,wand,This is simple and very necessary for any budding magician. For the price you can't go wrong. Children love to point it and wave it in the air. Adds that touch of drama to the whole performance. No batteries or pieces to put together just good old imagination.
2,The author gets in the way,"Electing to read IN AMERICA beacuse of its awards I found this bloated novel to be a bit heavy on author intrusiveness. As many have pointed out, the first chapter (actually a 27 page paragraph) makes the author analyze a room of Polish people and, without knowing the language or actually hearing conversations in toto, assign them roles as if casting the play that follows. I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded. Though Sontag is hypnotized by studies of history's influences on the present, I think she writes better when she sticks to her own metier."
1,In America,"What a disappointing bore! Our reading group expected an interesting and vibrant story about the utopian communities that formed in California in the 1870s. What we got was a long-winded diatribe without enlightnment of the supposed subject matter. Where was the plot? Where was the character development? In terms of both style and content, our book club all agreed that this was the most poorly written book we've read. Some of the books we've thought had interesting, thought-provoking stories include: Tales of Genji, White Oleander, Yellow Raft on Blue Water, and The Poisonwood Bible. We didn't feel that there was any beauty to the writing in Sontag's book. We agreed that we would have been interested in discovering more about the characters and their lives. However, it elicited no emotions or insights for us. It didn't capture the beauty of California or inform the reader about early California life. It was just rambling blah, blah, blah!"
2,"Really Wanted To Like This, But.............................","OK, it sounded like an interesting novel. I love well written historical novels, and hey thei one won the National Book Award! My only question to that is...WHY? It is passably OK. Mildely interesting story, laconic pacing, settings thathave been desceibed better by even the likes of John Jakes (isn't that sad, since I did NOT like his latest effort either). I keep reading, waiting for something to happen and I have so far beenr disappointed (and I am nearly finished). All I can say is I am glad I took this one out of the library first, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. Sorry, but awards do not a good book make. Two stars for effort and some nicely crafted language, otherwise find something else to read and don't waste your time on on this one."
1,Too Much Like Work,"If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century, then I read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century. This boring, pretentious, rambling, self-involved, pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction, but it reads like one of those junior-high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place. How on earth it could have received a National Book Award is a mystery, even considering the spotty reputation of the award. One or two times I began to feel swept up in the narrative (I appreciated Bogdan's journal entries, his unrequited pining for lovely young boys), but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy, boring letter or monologue. I would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern European artist coming to America in the nineteenth century to read Josef Skvorecky's 'Dvorak in Love'. Now there's a book!"
1,A waste of good paper!!,"The designation of ""National Book Award Winner"" has lost all credibility. What were the criteria for winning? My book club has been meeting for over 14 years and we unanimously voted this book as the worst book we have ever read."
2,disappointed,"i have not read other sontag works and was really looking forward to this novel by way of introduction. however, other than the highly creative and stunning ""chapter zero"" there was little to this book. the storyline seemed boring if not trite, and i did not find the writing style particularly interesting either. maryna had my attention off and on, but she and many of the other characters seemed flat to me, alternating between not-quite-alive to over-alive. short of RAVE reviews for some other piece of writing by her, i won't be sampling her other works any time soon."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I wish I had come to Amazon.com and read all the negative reviews before I wasted $... on this junk. I read the rave reviews on the back of the book and foolishly bought it. It is a rambling collection of pages about a period of history in which I have no interest (the 1800's) and the writing in very choppy and boring. The back of the book gave no clue as to the time period or the nationality of the characters. The ""coming to America"" stories are my least favorite. I never, ever throw books in the trash-I usually give them to charity or to the library. I threw this one away. I want this book off the street, so no other poor soul would make the same mistake I did and read this drivel."
5,brio,"my son loves it, good addition to his train set; however, the little green door is keep coming out, other than that -great toy"
4,Very informative,"This is a great introduction to the uses and limits of oral history, and demonstrates what is often its great veracity, especially in illiterate cultures. The concepts introduced in this book also provide an excellent introduction to the study of history in general, whether oral or otherwise."
2,I am the Blues,"Disappointed in the mix on this live performance . Many lead instruments are hard to hear. Lots of drum rhythms and vocals. Guitar, bass and piano are not well-balanced.Talking to audience during the performance is part of the CD, which gets old once you've heard the chatting .Recommend going to studio work with better mix on his other CDs."
1,Don't buy it. Don't watch it. Run.,"This movie is awful. I wish I could give it less than one star. Perhaps 3/8 of a star, maybe even 5/16 of a star would be more appropriate. It is so bad that I felt it was my duty to warn the rest of mankind. It fails to be even one little bit interesting or entertaining. You have been warned."
3,instructions,"how do you install these things , am having a very difficult time putting themon my existing racks, and they came with NO sort of instructions whatever!!"
3,A book that needs to be written better,"Elleh's effort is well-worthy of praise for its scope, but lacks in scholarly quality. Her triple-heritage theory is interesting but poorly-applied in many instances throughout the book, especially because of the broad timeline the book attempts to address. The images are marvelous, and inclusive, though some are incongrous to the articles they accompany. This is a very basic book, good for a coffee table or an introductory course on the subject, but one I could not recommend for the more serious scholar."
3,Final Grade: C-,"Good:1. How many books have you read on African Architecture?2. How many books have you read on African Architecture by a person of African descent?3. The book does not limit African architecture to rural village designs.4. Neither does it separate Egyptian architecture from African origins.Bad:1. It has few good pictures and too many black and white illustrations.2. Though it includes various aspects of African architecture its main focus is on Ancient Egyptian, North African, and contemporary architecture. Emphasis on West African adobe architecture, Medieval Swahili cities, and Ethiopian architecture was lacking severely, especially considering how much they truly represent the whole continent."
2,African Architecture,"Hugely disappointing. This book promises more than it really delivers. Having lived and worked as an architect in Africa, I found theresearch superficial and use of outdated references gives african architecture a less than positve image.I dont recoomend this book at all."
2,Good content but poorly written,"This book was a noble effort to shed light on a subject that most people know nothing about, but it misses the mark in literary style. In other words, it would be nice to have for reference, but it's nearly impossible to read. The style is akin to what I'd expect from a high school student writing a research paper. Elleh's triple heritage theory (traditional, Islamic and colonial influences on African styles) appears throughout the book, but never is it defended clearly and cohesively. I'd like to see this book re-written and professionally edited. With the amount of research that Elleh put into this work, the potential is there for a truly great book."
2,Poor book,"Dear Sirs,When I have ordered the book I thought it will be excellent sourse for me before studing some particular topic. But I was disapointed when I read it from the very begining. It is simply poor. African architecture is very rich. It is hard to imagine how the author could write such a poor book. Photos are also not very good. Everyone who understand and can ""read"" arcitecture would write that there is not enough information even on the subjects which are described in the book.I would say this book should cost less."
5,great,"for the price, this is an awesome grill. i agree with a reviewer below, some people expect too much for the price. the unit is lightweight and very portable. the ""flimsyness"" does not feel like a thrift store feel. It feels quite strong for a lightweight, $40 grill.clean up is a breeze. if you didn't read the instructions, you are suppose to fill up the water pan. the water pan is also removable. it makes cleaning such a breeze.Being able to use this as a grill or as a stove is very convienent. Clean up is good. Portability is awesome. For $40, this is definately worth the money. Just don't expect the quality to be equal to that of a $99 grill like some reviewers on here."
3,Fairly Pleased,We are pretty pleased with this item. It cooks slightly unevenly but it is little and easy to take places. The ignition starter didn't work from the start so that has been kind of annoying. But other than that we are pretty happy with it.
2,Great Idea That Did Not Work,"I bought two of these at Christmas time. The idea is great and thought they would be good in the cars. The first problem was that none of the tips would fit my Motorola C261 phone. Then I tried it on a Nokia 2600. Although there was a tip that fit perfectly, when I tried to charge the phone the phone screen said STOP and had a little stop sign on it. So I assume the volts were not correct. The flash lite has two setting and worked great. Returned the items as did not work for me."
2,"Well, it is a flashlight","I got one of these to power my cell phone, I have an LG VX-9800, a Treo 700WX and a Samsung a950 and you think with all the tips supplied that I would be able to use it with one of the phones but no. I tried to give it to my daughter and it didn't fit her phone either. I never found anyone with a phone it fit to give it to.I just use it as a wind up flashlight now. If anyone finds a source of compatible tips for other model phones that work with this, I would like to know."
4,You don't have to be/have a sister to enjoy it.,"It was a joy to see how these two sisters took the highs and lows of life, love and loss, birth and death, laughter and tears, and made me feel a part of the event. Shakespeare said brevity is the soul of wit and the authors have captured that advice superbly. There are poems in this book that are so short in lines yet are so deep and touching in the message conveyed, they sparkle with brilliance. You don't have to be a woman, or have a sister, to enjoy the celebration of the authors' lives."
5,Heartwarming - a treasure to give or receive,Songs to Sisters made me laugh and cry - sometimes at the same time. Touched everyone of my feminine strings and mirrored my own experiences. Wish these authors were my sisters. Every woman I have given it to as a gift has felt the same.
5,A poetic saga of womanhood.,"All the pains and joys of being--these brave, remarkable sisters will sing to your heart. Their poetic journey through womanhood is a trip to the depths of the feminine soul. O'Lill and Olcott's tribute to womanhood will remain on your bedside table, and you will want to buy copies for all the women you love."
4,"Read it, you will enjoy it.","When I read Songs to Sisters, I feel like I am sneaking peeks into a charished diary. Some thoughts are so intimate, I almost feel guilty for reading them. Yet, I am honored that these women chose to share their thoughts and experiences with me."
4,Soft as a morning sunrise,How long can a girl go on dreaming?A gentle record. A pretty record. Sentimental and nice. Light as her floral sundress.-loveinmono.tumblr
3,Easy Listening,"This record, excluding the bonus tracks, is ballads, mostly jazz standards. If you are looking for bossa nova, this is not the album for you.Astrud Gilberto has a wonderful voice, and the arrangements are pretty. If memory serves, all songs are sung in English. There are two tracks I really don't like. 'A Banda (Parade)' because just don't like the song, and 'You didn't have to be so nice', which she sings with her son (way too cute). On the other hand, 'Misty Roses' and 'I had the Craziest Dream' and quite nice.The five bonus tracks are more to my taste. They all come from the album 'A Certain Smile, A Certain Sadness', which is available on CD, and is more in the bossa nova style. I particularly like 'Goodbye Sadness', both for the song and the performance by Astrud and the Walter Wanderly Trio.The CD comes with a reproduction of the original album artwork, which is entertaining and endearing."
4,really moving,Testimonies are really moving. The narrator is old and a retired Cadiologist. But worth the testimonies. It WILL change your life! God Bless! Vickie
1,Indyfans & the Quest for Fortune & Glory,Very disappointed. A complete waste of time could not finish watching. It hard sometime to write a review. I am a great Indyfan but not this one.
3,Hmm...,"A decidedly odd toy. For one thing, I'm not sure how they came to call it a ""dashboard"" doll; at 8 inches, it's far too big for any dashboard smaller than a pick-up truck. Also, though Krusty does indeed talk, the playback is tinny and the speed variable, so you usually can't understand what he says. There's also so much repetition of phrases that it's easy to get bored with him -- and every other time you get the goofy song, which is too fast and too garbled to pick out more than every fifth word.A curiosity more than a fun toy, unless you're an obsessive Simpsons collector."
3,Sinuhe's story,"Although this book is supposed to be one of the best books ever written by a Finn, I don't really go along with this. It's definately not a book for ""all ages"", more like for people ages 40->. Me, being 15, reading the book at 13, found it good but a little bit too long-winded. True, once you start you can't stop, but you won't get a good feeling after it. When I came to the ending, I had a feeling of ""What? That's all?"". Some of the parts could have been said in fewer words, while some of the parts were not as much as touched upon. Not recommended for those people looking for slightly more action in a book. If you want Egyptian style and don't like long-winded books, go for Christian Jacq's Ramses."
3,If you can get through it... a good story,"The biggest obstacle in reading this for me was the dated language. Whether this is because it's a translation or because it was written a long time ago, it doesn't read like modern historical fiction, which I really like. However, if you can put up with the long drawn out sentences and you really enjoy ancient Egypt, you will probably like this book about such notable historical figures as Amunhotep, Horemheb and Nefertiti."
5,Get Yours Hands on any of Waltari's Work!,"How I wish that all of Waltari's works would be reprinted and easily available! The Egyptian is simply one of the all-time best pieces of historical ficion ever written. If you're a fan of this genre, then grab this author's books. The Etruscan is a bit more mystical, but is an excellent read and Secret of the Kingdom takes a Roman viewpoint of the times leading up to Jesus's death. The Dark Angel is just that - a bit darker than the other novels, but all are chock full of unforgettable characters and settings. I can't recommend this man's works any more highly!"
2,Why cut it?,"I loved this book when reading it in my language, but after getting an english copy for a friend I noticed it is about half as long (some 300 pages missing) and heavily edited. Having read the original this seemed to completely ruin the book, leaving out way too many nuances from the story. I haven't found an uncut english version yet."
4,The Egyptian: A Novel,Well written and historically accurate. Many of the main character's decisions were not logical given the events at that time. Interesting and worth reading if you enjoy historical fiction.
3,Not such an interesting read,"I know I am completely in the minority here, but I am being honest when I say that this book just didn't grab me the way it grabbed everyone else. I thought the characters were just average, the story plodding, and the sentences too long and boring. Clearly, many other people would disagree with me, otherwise this wouldn't be such a popular book and have so many glowing reviews. I wish I felt otherwise and had the same enthusiasm for the book which others do, but it just didn't feel real and thrilling to me."
2,clip case,it does protect your phone but it started cracking after only having it for two weeks so if you plan on it being used every day plan on replacing it soon.
3,decent product,"The product was good, I just didn't recieve the case for the right blackberry. Before you purchase, make sure you get the right pearl case."
2,hard!,"hard to get on, makes the keys hard to push, but it does what it's supposed to, protect my pearl :)"
2,"Looks nice, isn't the best quality","This was a nice case at first. It looks nice and protects what it covers. After two weeks the case broke where it clips together, as if the phone was too big for the case. It's the right model for it and everything. I noticed under the case started to slightly scratch the phone as well. I was disapointed but then again, it wasn't an expensive loss. I'm now looking for a better case."
2,"will break, dont't buy it","this cover is so weak, and it will break after a week or so.I read similar reviews but I didn't believe them, now I know its true."
1,Threw it away,This was a waste of a few dollars. I literally threw it away within a minute of opening the package and looking at it.
3,Durable But Not Always Practical,This product is certainly durable and it has protected my phone which is what I bought it for. Unfortunately though removing it isn't easy and getting it off hurts a bit. It needs to be removed regularly to get the dust out that collects around the inside of the case from being in your bag or pocket. It would be GREAT if it still fit in a case after putting it on so that you could have the option if you wanted it to.But I'll take durability over a clean phone usually... if I HAVE to.
5,Great Product - Very Happy,I really like this clear little case. I have dropped my phone a few times and the edge is cracked. I was worried that I was going to have to get a new phone. But this case protects the cracked edge. And now I can finally clip it onto my jeans. Yeah. Fast Shipping. Great product. Thanks!
2,"Protects for a few bucks, but you can find better","The case for this model looks great in the picture, but mine was scratched and looked bad after putting it on my phone. I originally wanted to preserve the stylish black of my new pearl, but this case did not do that for me. The clip on the back also broke after a few weeks time. Also, dust will definitely get between the clip and your phone if keep it in your pocket.EforceCity offered to replace the product or provide me a refund if I changed the review, but this product was only a few bucks so I'd rather post an honest review of the product and deal with the faults of this product.This thing is still on my phone after 4 months, but only because I am prone to dropping it when I go out.Spend money on a better case or a scratch resistant clear adhesive for the display of your phone (which I also purchased)."
5,Eforcity Clear Belt Clip for Blkberry Pearl,"Fast service, inexpensive and great item to protect your Blackberry, I am still able to use all the ports with the case on the Blackberry."
5,Great case,"This case is exactly what I expected. After buying a clear case for my ipod...then dropping the ipod and it survived...I wanted the same for my blackberry. I finally found this product online. I had some difficultly snapping it on the phone, because it's a tight fit. But once on, I've had no problems with it."
3,"easy, simple, but a hassle.","i liked it at first, and it provides great protection, but LOTS of dust gets stuck in between the edges of the plastic case and the phone. It gets really unsightly and it's a bit of a hassle to unclip the case to clean out, only to have to do it again after 1 week."
4,One cent. Why not?,"For a cent, why not? You pay for it in shipping, but where don't you pay shipping these days? The case fits around the phone. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't feel snug, and the plastic seems cheap; but it actually is. the knob in the back is at times awkward, and i don't use the belt clip. But mainly, I know the case will protect my phone when i inevitably drop it. I have one for my iPod too, and it certainly protected that. RECOMMENDED!"
1,Helpful - but I am not impressed,This book basically is a re-write of Platform SDK documentation on Microsoft Cluster Service. All the information that you need on MSCS is already available in Platform SDK (which is free). If you are looking for additional info that what's in Platform SDK this book isn't the one you want to buy. Wish I spent the money on some other book!
4,One tree hill road mix review,this cd is great. it was delivered in a timey manner and was package as per the description
5,Awesomeness,"It's a great CD! There's not a song I don't like. Tyler's new song is a must be hit. The Weepies are always a good addition.That's what I like about the OTH soundtracks. They're not filled with ""what's now"" hot in the music scene, but rather songs that can be listened to over and over, because you're not going to always hear them on the radio."
3,bought it,"Got it right here from Amazon's marketplace....good deal for 5.00$. The episode this is based on is one of the best, most innocent of them all. The music was good too. I always like the music on this show....buy it:):):):)"
3,Get your muscles ready!!!,"Against my better judgement, my husband and I waited until Christmas eve to put this together!!! LOL! O-M-G!! It wasn't the directions, it was bending the springs. This part was very difficult. The finished product is cute and very durable. It's isn't as springy as I remember my spring horse being as a kid, but I guess the horse sounds kind of make up for that."
1,Poor Quality Rocking Hore,"""Lightning"" Spring HorseI purchased this rocking horse for my 19 month Grandaughter at Christmas and by late January the switches located in the ears no longer activated the music or animated horse sounds. It simply did not stand up to the rigors of a child. It was also difficult to attach the springs. I expected for the cost of the item it would last at least a year. Too bad..."
3,"You have to put it together, and it's hard","This cute bouncy horse comes in pieces - you need a magnifying glass to read the assembly directions, and you better not do it in the order the steps are given. Better yet, spend the extra money and find one that's already assembled. It takes two strong people to get the springs attached.The kid loves the toy, but we're not sure how durable it will be in the long run. And since it was made in China, the paint could very well be lead-based."
4,grand daughter loved it,"gand daughter loved it, she loves the sounds it makeswas easy to put togetherliked the safety strapswould recommend to others"
4,Forgiving,"With all the problems in the Catholic church at the moment, it was refreshing to go back and re-read Father William's book. He is an amazing story teller. Through his stories, one sees how forgiveness benfits the forgiver and is a necessary part of the healing process. The church should be giving copies of this book to all the abuse victims to help them find peace."
4,"Beautifully Filmed, Intelligent Commentary","Although it doesn't say so, either on the screen credits or the package, this video uses a lot of material from the History Channel, and is of comparable quality.What it describes is the Golden Age of Medieval Spain when Christians, Moslems and Jews lived together in harmony, resulting in a flowering of art and achitecture and substantial economic growth. Then Ferdinand and Isabella began their own reign of terror, kicking out the Muslims and Jews and initiating the Inquisition, and Spain (similar to Italy's experience post-Galileo) became a scientific and economic backwater.The best part of this video is the scholarly commentary by experts from Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and non-sectarian institutions, effectively replicating the diversity and tolerance of Moorish Spain.Highly recommended.Warning: There is another video on the same topic,When the Moors Ruled in Europe. It is not as good as this video."
4,Cities of Light,very interesting unfortunately it is not possible to watch it in Spain on the TV as it is only made for Stateside viewing. Perhaps you could change that or at least write it on the information about the DVD. I watched it on my Computer.
5,Cities of Light,"This film is a balanced overview of the history of Islam in Spain. In fact, it provides an accurate historical account with the mostly positive contributions of Muslims to a civilized society and one which practiced tolerance for Jews and Christians. At the same time, it does not overlook actions by a minority of extremists who sought to destroy tolerance at certain historical periods. One must remember Islam existed in Spain for some 700-800 years. I would recommend this film as a study tool for students of Islamic History in Spain."
4,why does it need a title?,The foam liner had to be modified but after all I was fixing a fourty year old water heater. The hounding by amazon to review this product sucks!
5,Excellent,"This book is the continuation of the story of the Caribou-Eskimo (Ihalmiut), of whom Mowat first wrote about in his first book, People of the Dear. The latter was an account of his experiences among these people while doing research for the government in 1947 and 1948. The Desperate People relates the plight of the Ihalmiut over the course of the next ten years. During this time, the Ihalmiut suffer considerably, the victims of exploitation, prejudice, governmental bungling, ignorance, and willful mistreatment. It is a chronicle of the decline of a once independent, self-sufficient people into a wretched, servile and dependent lot. The book left me feeling angered and ashamed. It is a book that should be read by all Canadians."
1,This book ... monkeys,"I thought this book stunk. He must of been really desperate to publish a book. It was like reading a porly written history book. I couldn't understand anything he said. I didn't know who was who and where everything is. He repeated himself alot and jumped around. It really bit, even though I gave it a star it deserves no stars."
1,Very interesting.,"I think the arthur was really desperate when he set out to write a book about the people that is not his race and at the time of his travel, the people he wrote about were normads and now today, they are reading his book. It is interesting."
1,Rantings of a hypocrite,"Don Feder was so busy focusing on other people's families when he wrote this book that his own son got expelled from the entire state public school system as a danger to his fellow classmates. Feder goes apoplectic over gays and lesbians, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Puerto Ricans, and anyone else who doesn't fit his narrow view of what is right, but would his own skills as a parent survive such scrutiny? In on piece, Feder rants about how ""father-absent homes"" produce children more likely to commit crimes and engage in violent behavior. ..."
5,A delight.,"These are colorful and useful. They are advertised as dishwasher safe, but take care to keep them from knocking into other items in your dishwasher, as they will chip. There are matching candy dishes and bowls. The prices here are the best on the Net, as of 9/24/12."
5,"Great Record, one of my favorites","The music is beautiful, but the lyrics are what got me. If you like Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith, XTC or early David Bowie, you'll love this."
5,a trip back in time with my people,"as i first opened the book and read the basis of where the data was aquired i was awestruck and knew that i was not only going to read this book but live it through the eyes of my parents and of their parents before them . you cannot help but feel the agony as diego recalls the events that he has witnessed throughout his life both those of curiousity for these strange men and the terror the and destruction they leave in their wake . but human beings from all races have in them an indomitable will to survive , and in this book you will witness that and say a prayer to whatever power you happen to believe in . Thank GOD ."
3,Satisfied,It is a cute program. The music is fun and my kids love it. The controler is not very difficult so they get bored just pushing the button over and over. So they end up just watching it like a video. Over all it is good.
4,Backyardigans,"My granddaughter loves this game and uses it all the time. While I was afraid it might be too young for her, she seems to find it entertaining and fun. Because it is one of her more favorite shows on TV, it also keeps her attention because she knew the characters prior to playing the game and was able to relate to them right off."
5,GEORGE DUKE,I would give a 10 star rating if I could - perhaps 20!!! Thank you so very much. I am VERY pleased!
4,"Lists, Lists, Lists","The Book of Lists for Teens is a book full of over 250 lists on everything from ""The 11 Best TV Moms"" to ""Things you didn't know about AIDS that you should."" They are catorigized into 6 chapters, and some are hilarious ""10 Tips for raising Good, Well-Adjusted Parents"" while some are more serious. Best, though, are the lists of Cds, Books, and Movies. These lists include things like ""5 Greatest books about baseball"" or ""Adult Books That Many Teens Enjoy."" For movies my favorite was ""10 Great Coming-of Age Films.""I would reccomend this book for Girls AND Guys 13 and up, because some of the material isn't good for people under that age. Enjoy your Lists!"
4,Show it love,Indo G and the rest went hard on this album. Track 11 is definitely my favorite-- K-Roc ripped that track. Pick this up if you're a fan of the original Prophet Posse. The whole album is strong.
4,Best Book For Advanced Conversational Practice,"I have used the Interchange series, as well as others. Interchange format encourages diologue between instructor and students. Interchange 3 is only for very advanced ESL students."
5,Excellent collection of some of Baden's classic studio work,"This CD collection is one of the best examples of Baden's instrumental studio work from the mid sixties into the early 70's. It is actually three important LPs on the Saba MPS label collected together. Tristeza On Guitar (1966), Poema on Guitar (1967) and Apaixonado (1973). These were three of Baden's stongest studio recordings and, although not even close to being comprehensive of his opus, they do contain many of his best compositions and classic arrangements by other composers including Round Midnight and Dindi. Baden was in classic form for these sessions with his playing and arranging skills fully formed and impressive. German production skills are in evidence and the recordings are excellent. Too bad this excellent 2-cd collection of such an important player is no longer available."
3,Be sure to use a size conversion tool!!,"I bought this bra is a 36J - which is my size. And its WAY WAY too big. the band is too big. The wires are no where near flat in the front. The cups are 2-3 sizes too big. I'm returning it and willing to try guessing at smaller sizes. After I bought it, I saw that the sizing was UK sizes & not US... well, I though 36J was a UK size. Apparently I was misinformed. BUT the bra's tag itself says US 36J & UK 36J. But I read on another site that a J is GG in UK... but that still doesn't explain why the band is soo big. Anyways - I haven't read any bad reviews about this bra, so I'm returning it and trying a smaller size... wish there was a store in town that I could just go to instead of playing the guessing game."
2,Lee men's stretch jeans,"Wrong size arrived, 38"" waist was ordered, 42"" waist arrived. Returned the item, ordered a second pair hoping for a 38"" waist. No luck, the second pair arrived with a 35"" waist.They fitted someone we know so we kept them. We will not order this item again. Someone at the factory needs to measure the waist before the item is sent out, it's such a waste of time and money to keep returning items.The item is lightish blue as represented in picture, the jeans are comfortable because of the stretch. Wish I knew a a reliable company that sells men's stretch jeans."
4,old fashion fathers,My dad has used the same model and brand jeans from thy kingdom come and he was so happy when we found these jeans because he doesn't see them in stores anymore. Great buy in his eyes too old fashioned to me
4,Lee Stretch Jeans,My husband really likes to wear Lee Regular Fit Stretch Jeans everyday. They move with him and do not cling when he gets hot and sweaty. They are quite comfortable.
5,great fishing song on this one!,"hey, it da yoopers!nothing but funI bought several of these mainly out of curiosity and after listening so them, I decided to share them with a friend of mine.these guys have a great timedown to earth people."
5,Loved it!,"Wonderful writing, wonderful plot, great period setting and great characters! Very sad that author passed away and can no longer grace us with his words. Buy this book and the others in the series!"
1,Bad acting film,"As with any Zombie film the possibility's are endless. This seems to be just a cash in on the Zombie mania of today. For low budget horror films visit/re-visit the originals. You'll feel better. If i had to choose from low budget zombie films that were original i'd say 'The Veil' is up there for horror, followed by 'Shaun of the Dead' for laughs. I feel with a better cast 'Zombie Town's next film might be better."
2,What the hell?,"I'm a big fan of zombie movies, but I thought that this movie is not that good. I didn't care at all for the idea of slug parasites causing a zombie outbreak."
5,A classic comedy,I watched this movie in the late 80-s. It was funny at that time. I was afraid that with so much time passing it would lose its appeal and zest. I was wrong. It is a classic comedy in the true Gogol-ian style.
4,A Well Written and Enjoyable Travelogue,"This book tells a very enjoyable story about Nashville's birth and culture as Music City. This is a unique travelogue that gives the visitor a real feel for Nashville and its interesting character and characters. The book is a fun read as we learn more about Music City, the music business and the author, Stephen Foehr. By the way, I've met Mr. Foehr, and the title's double enterdre is not by accident. I bought this book used on Amazon for $4.00 (including shiping); it was a steal."
3,Not really a travel guide...,"Sure the book talks about Nashville's rich history and some of its landmarks, but the book is more about 'waking up' in a sense of opening your eyes to the business that is country music. The author talks about labels being swallowed up by other labels, the 'plastic cowboys' of the 1990s and how many new acts fail (versus becoming successful artists)in the little big town that is Nashville. I found it very interesting because I am a marketing major and there are a lot of facts and figures about what it actually costs to make and promote a record.The author talked with Jill King when she was doing sets for basically no money at Tootsie's and dreaming of a record deal. Now she has released ""Jillbilly"" - it would be interesting to have an epilogue with her. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a behind-the-scenes look at the music industry, but not so much if you want a tourist guide to Nashville."
2,"""Waking Up in Nashville"" put me to sleep!","No question the author, Stephen Foehr, knows his stuff about Nashville. He obviously spent a lot of time interviewing well-known (and not so well-known) country artists, as well as people behind the scenes - producers, writers, etc. The weakness in the book, from my perspective, is that it is too wordy. There are too many details and too much repetition. I found myself skipping ahead to more interesting parts of the book.If you are interested in reading a very detailed ""fact-book"" about the state of the country music industry in Nashville, then this is your book. However, if you're looking for a fun, engaging read, you might want to look elsewhere."
5,So good it's sick.,"Recently moved to Lafayette, Louisiana. I thought I knew a little bit about Zydeco before I got here, but quickly figured out I didn't know that much at all. I mean, if I had, I would certainly have had this record in my collection a very long time ago. Simply put, this is one rollicking good time. Don't play this if you don't want a party to spontaneously erupt.Shaggy Dog Two Step is worth the price of the album alone. It is overflowing with energy, humor, and above all, an incredibly high level of musicianship from an absolutely amazing band. The amount of energy bursting forth from this group is enough to place this album in the company of The Who's Live at Leeds and Sonny Landreth's Grant Street as the most incandescent live recordings of any kind.An essential album."
2,"Stan, Astrud and Joao go their seperate ways","According to ""Stan Getz - a life in Jazz"", Stan had broken up with Astrud after an affair that wrecked her marriage to Joao Gilberto.None of them was speaking to the others. Each got up on stage with a different backup band, mostly they don't play together. Like oil and water. The result is mediocre. A major disappointment after the perfect synchrony and intimacy of ""Getz/Gilberto"". For completists.""Jazz Samba 2"" is a much better followup."
5,Favorite cd of all time,"I got this album about 7 years ago and from the first time I listened to it, it took its place as my all-time favorite. It was my introduction to samba and my inspiration to search for more jazz for my cd collection.The music is so versatile and comforting - it is a perfect complement to whatever mood I'm in, be it upbeat or somewhat sad. It is complex but not too challenging to listen to like some other jazz can be. It does not get old or boring to me.Other reviewers have simply compared this album to others in the genre, but I would rather think of it standing on its own as a wonderful introduction for someone who doesn't have much jazz in their collection, and a must-have for those who do."
5,**JAZZ EXCELLENTS**,"Stan Getz is far more my favorite Jazz Sax players than them all and believe me i like the whole lot of them, CANNONBALL ADDERLEY, DEXTER GORDON, CHARLIE ""BIRD"" PARKER, LESTER YOUNG, GERRY MULIGAN, BUD SHANK, ART PEPPER and the list goes on and on.I had gotten to the point th@ i could tell GETZ's playing just by the distinct sound th@ he had w/ his sax, no kidding you. These Brazilian Jazz Sambas sessions he did w/ GILBERTO and others, was the greatest and ASTRUD GILBERTO, JOAO'S wife @ the time, was phenomenal (The Whole GIRL FROM IPANEMA Thing you see)Thanx all. Happy Listening.Michael B. VA"
4,Read it for David Weitzman...,"I knew the story of Rama and Sita, and wanted to know how David Weitzman (of the 'Brown Paper School book' series) treated it. I should say it was good. Though the story is the same, this is the Javanese version of the same story of Rama and Sita, and obviously is a bit different in places, from the scriptures available in India, where the original mythological legend is based on.Weitzman has a knack for making it seem friendly and appealing to children and in this book he uses his own artistic projection, while keeping the basic form of the art intact. The figurines in the book resemble the puppets used in ancient Javanese version of the art of puppetry, marked by their long-limbed figurines. David makes these shadow forms glitter, with his usage of gold color.Worth reading for kids interested in legendary mythologies."
3,pretty good,"This is a pretty cool DVD, but theres not enough... being idiots like the good old cky days... since its bams 411, you would think there would be appearances from the whole gang, raab dicomillo... dunn makes a few appearances but theres just not enough of the cky crew... even bam is left out a lot in this video. When i saw this vid i expected to see all bams crew kicking their own asses again. I wasnt all disappointed, i still recommend this for die hard cky fans. I based this review mostly because it was bams edition and i expected more cky crew, but dont get me wrong the skating was awesome... 5 starts on that in case thats what u were looking for. oh and the 2nd disc is awesome."
3,Interesting but philosophically/scientifically controversial,"Truth or falsity cannot be verified in any way knowable to us as human beings. Meaning is subjective. True objectivity doesn't exist.To that end, I feel this book only has value insofar as a ""spiritual"" person could pick it up and convince him/herself that this is a new philosophy on life-- an awakening! However, please realize that accepting this man's ""research"" as being scientifically and empirically rigorous is pretty ridiculous from the viewpoint of the popular and academic majorities. If science is the modern religion, believing this ""study"" is heretical."
5,Relate the world around to yourself,An interesting way to relate our body and our physics to the environment.
1,Unfortunate Neglect of Scientific Method,"I'm not a big fan of dismissing someone's work and I really wanted to find something valid in Emoto's ""research"" but his lack of respect for the scientific method has tainted his work. I've seen him in person, my exchange student from Japan was on hand to help him if he got stuck with his English and I was sadly disappointed by how his conduct contradicted his premise and made his work seem like it's about making money, not finding scientific evidence. Scientific discoveries need to be clearly outlined with their method so the results can be tested and reproduced. He has been suspiciously vague.Emoto paints a pleasant picture but there is no substance. And unfortunatly after seeing how he treated my exchange student and his own assistant, I can't take him seriously. Seeing him in person was my last ditch attempt to find something legit in his work, and I came away more disappointed than ever."
4,A Fascinating Read,"After reading this book, I took it to work to share with my co-workers who come from different backgrounds and religions. Everyone was fascinated by the concepts presented in this book. Water, music and spirituality. If it does nothing else, it will challenge you to think outside the box."
1,"This book deserves a minus 5 stars, I am amazed at how many good people accept without question what this guy presents","I am a water efficiency consultant. I am fascinated and amazed by the magical beauty of water. But I also recognize that there are many scientific principles that govern the behavior of water. That science does not detract from the beauty and mystery of water for me. I do not need to throw science out the window to appreciate that beauty but apparently many others do. I once watched a 2 hour slide show and talk by Mr. Emoto, hoping to ask questions. He refused to take any questions afterwards, even though I had plenty. Where are the side by side comparisons of the ice structure of the same water that did not have the word or picture influences? Until similar photos are created with a control group and with the involvement of neutral 3rd party scientists, I can not believe any of the claims. But I will always have a childlike amazement at the endless beauty and mystery of water."
4,The Soul,"This book is inspirational and provides one piece of the puzzle of the mystery of life. I read it just after finishing ""The Divine Code"" by Kazuo Murakami. Both books conclude that the secret to a more healthy and happy life is positive thinking and gratitude. There are thousands of more complex spiritual books available, but if you are limited in time, I recommend this book to give your life more meaning.A concept presented by Emoto with which I disagree is that our soul is contained in water. I just finished a book with a much more compelling concept of the soul called ""This Side of the Gate"" by John P. Johnston. I read it along with Murakami's and Emoto's books. Johnston's book is by far the most intriguing and thought-provoking. Just what is the soul? Without going ""Ken Wilbur"" on us, Johnston presents insights into the soul, karma, and reincarnation which complements the other two books. I recommend reading all three books concurrently."
4,An interesting book,"Does water remember emotion? It's a stretch of the mind to think about this subject, but the author states a strong case as long as you keep an open mind. The photographs are fascinating."
5,Great book,"This book provides scientific evidence of what we unconsciously know, that being grateful, positive and loving have a profound impact in our lives and on the people around us . It is great to have it."
5,"Masaur Emoto ""rocks"" Water it is for all of us to survive",I have read almost all Masaru Emotos book and also have his cards. Learned alot from his books as everyone who reads it would....get the book everyone!!!
3,Fun exploration of possible meaning in water,"This illustration of photographic water crystals taken under different conditions explores and proposes meaning to the shape of the crystals themselves. The hypothesis suggests that water is a medium of communication and that this is closely aligned to human health and well-being by the fact that humans are at least 70% liquid creatures. The publisher's corporate mission is to ""inspire to integrity"" and the material in this book does this while trying to integrate common sense and even some astrophysics. I consider it a worthwhile read from a personal philosophical exploration of our human species. It is a fanciful and energized continuation of Charlie Ryrie's ""The Healing Energies of Water"" ( 1999)."
3,no water is ugly,water is....period its representation of life is immensly underestimated and ignored-further proof of its omnipotenence of existance--- hence AIR- a few more words by our sponsor
4,Arbitrary Interpretations of Ambiguous Phenomena,"Being a diehard skeptic, I disagree profoundly with the theory that water molecules are conscious and can respond intelligently to words, images, and music. I believe Mr. Emoto is seeing what he wants to see in a lot of the crystals. However, I give the book four stars for the beauty of the publication. If you like New Age stuff, then you'll enjoy this little volume. If you grew up with secular K-12 public schooling in the '70's and '80's and have a closed mind like me, you might mock it as pseudoscience. But you still have to admire how it is presented."
2,More than just a little bit flaky...,"Well, yeah, I saw ""What the *bleep* Do We Know"" and got very excited and bought all of these books. While I appreciate Mr Emoto's subtley and humility in presenting his work, it winds up being just as hard to stomach that much of it is thinly veiled hoopla with little or no solid science behind it. He fails to explain how many photos he took of each kind of water he photographed for instance-- there are just too many gaping holes. But hey, what the bleep do I know? When it comes down too it, I think this sort of physics, philospohy/spiritual theory of everything-- kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology. More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking."
2,A new view of water,"Pretty pictures, intriguing idea, but little information to back it up. What was the methodology? Have the results been replicated? Where is the science here? Lightweight."
5,Written in Love and for Love,"A truly sweet account of the author's quest to find out using snow/ice-water-crystals how water changes and is influenced by us with pollution/thought/emotion etcThe author was so convinced of his findings that he originally self-published his book. He was tireless in his enthusiasm for what he found.Some of the pictures are such a delight it makes you think twice about even drinking a glass of water, let alone leaving one lying around.As a qualified Homeopath and author of How to Survive a Pisces, I have a deep knowledge of water is all its guises and I congratulate Mr Emoto's vision.If you want to hear him talking about resonance go to[...] and you will see Mr Emoto talking more about his theories.I loved this book and even the story of it made me feel tearful because it was written in love and for love:)"
4,Interesting Read,"They say technology will advance by 1000X in the next 100 years compared to the last 100 years. If this is true, will we advance in the knowledge of water or will it simply be a constant variable in our lives. This book opens a new chapter in the human experience. Is water more than what it seems?Most people think very mechanically in how the world works. We believe in only solid evidence and concrete data to advance in science. I believe this way of thinking seems to advance our society but does so very slowly.I think Dr. Emoto wants us to think beyond what we know. We need an open mind to consider some of the things he talks about.I have read several of his books. Some of the ideas he has seem odd, but they are at least worth considering. Definitely more research needs to be done with water.This was the first book I read from him. I enjoyed reading it. It really made me think a little differently about water."
5,Something to think about,Water is one of the most mysterious elements on the earth. Great right from the start. The pictures are beautiful and it is worth reading.
1,A baby ate my dingo!!,Dr. Emoto is currently working on a way to isolate happiness in water and replicate it synthetically with lincoln logs and eye of newt.This book is a wonderful example of how empirical science is trying to deny Dr. Emoto access to the enriched uranium he so desperately requires which will allow automobiles to crap rainbows under a sky with diamonds.Finally someone has taken all the guess-work out of thinking so I can get back to breeding an army of sasquatch.
1,What Are You Thinking?,"What are all you people thinking? Anyone who rates this highly and/or takes an interest in this is basically a qwack. Save your cash, or if you're considering this put your head in the toilet for a better ""read"" about water."
1,Next!,"Dr. Emoto weaves a crystaline web of distraction, where emotions take prevelance over science.He undertook extensive research of water around the planet not so much as a scientific researcher but more from the perspective of an original thinker. At length he realized that it was in the frozen crystal form that water showed us its true nature through.Uh Huh, and gravity is a giant hand encouraging me to stay grounded in case Zues is angered and throws a mighty thunderbolt my way."
1,Oh Will You Please Give It A Rest,"Oh boy, ""irrefutable proof"" of the power of prayer, how scientific. This is just another heap of stuperstitious bunk to throw atop the rubbish pile of new age pseudoscience.Anyone can take a picture of water to make it look however they want it to look."
1,What the Bleep?,This is not the movie What the Bleep? This is a movie about the making of the movie What the Bleep? I feel that I was tricked into buying it.
3,perhaps well-intended but ..,"Perhaps well-intended but truly it lacks scientific proof. I'd be ok with that except I feel it deceiving if presented as fact. I've even been to a lecture held by the author on this particular book and it's promotion. I walk away VERY disappointed in both presentation & content and has since even made me question motive. In fact, in good consciousness I can not even give away the extra books I purchased now that I've had time to reflect and ponder. The photography is often very stunning, breathtaking and yes, it gives cause for deep reflecion just by looking at the vast difference & forms of one tiny water crystal. Perhaps the author is on to something of truth, and certainly I wanted that to be the case but in all honesty his reputaion needs to be refurbished in my mind and validated in the world of science before I can give substantial credit."
1,Incredible book!,"Literally incredible. I mean it lacks a scintilla of credibility. How far does someone have to go with wild, speculative, unsupportable, obviously illogical theories before every human being, even the most gullible, would say ""do you think . . . nahh!"" Clearly we as a people are desperate to find meaning, even if we have to impose the most inane theory imaginable on our world. And how convenient that it asks so little of us: Look! We're already mostly water! That alone makes us deep! Please, people: get a grip! We have real problems to address that won't be fixed by feeling all gooey about being all wet."
5,Hidden Messages in Water calendar review,This calendar really is pretty. It is definately not like any calendar I have seen before! The information in this calendar is also very interesting. I ordered this because it seemed original & it really is. I like it very much!!
5,Beautiful images that speak to the soul.,"The author may leave some scientific information to be desired, but the images he presents are so amazing and beautiful you instantly become grateful for what he presents and are filled with gratitude and love. The water crystal images really spoke to me, and I highly highly recommend this book to everyone!"
2,No scientic research,"The basic premise of this entire book and the philosophy of Masaru Emoto is that water crystals are affected by thoughts, attitudes and feelings. This is a very exciting idea and one that I really do want to believe in.However, never in this book is there any scientific research - absolutely none. The most basic principle of scientific research is reproducible results by reputable third parties. Who are Emoto-son's researchers? Allow me to quote, ""I wrote this experiment in the book that I published, and as a result hundreds of families throughout Japan conducted this same experiment for themselves. EVERYONE reported the same results."" And that's all you get folks!Really, I want to believe, I really do, but show some respect to human logic and scientific discipline. If there is ANY real research it should be in the book."
2,science?,"It's interesting that no one else seems to be able to replicate Mr. Emoto's findings. While fascinating in thought, the fact needs to be proven."
1,Beyond Absurd - Regardless of Your Beliefs,"Utter nonsense - forget whether or not the concept of the book is believable - I would like to think so. But there is simply no basis for the author's conclusions - no scientific studies, no proof, just this individual claiming all these unsupported conclusions on his personal experiments. Moreover, it is simply ludicrous to believe that somehow water, in any form or essence, would respond to our printed language - as some of his ""experiments"" allegedly have proven. Are we so arrogant to believe that somehow another force (whatever) is going to place the same meaning we place on a jumbled collection of letters written in what we refer to as ""Japanese"" or ""English"" or whatever language the author was using in these so-called experiments? This may be the most inane book I have ever seen - impossible to take it seriously."
1,fraud or just gobbletygook,"This book is full of misunderstandings of basic physics and even arithmetic. It is either fraud or just utterly stupid. There are many fairly good pictures of ice crystals, and the basic messages, e.g. ""The world is linked together by love and gratitude"" are nice and can provoke thought.Some reviewers defend this book saying things like ""it isn't meant to be scientifically rigorous"" or ""it isn't a science journal"" or even ""It just dosn't seem like valid science to people who lack the author's brilliant insight."" But, the main thrust of the book is an attempt to provide a foundation for thoughts about love and water through what is purported as experimental results and valid scientific theory. The ""facts"" are not accurate, are misunderstood, or just make no sense. There seems to be a longing among many readers for scientific validation of spiritual ideas, but I think it is a disservice to take advantage of their gullibility and ignorance, as this book does."
3,Good book but...,"The photography and how water is impacted by various things is truly wonderful stuff. However Emoto's conclusions, his surmising and projections about the world is offered with surprisingly poor reasoning as he leads the reader down the paths he has travelled. For all we know all objects are as affected by our thoughts and words as water appears to be, perhaps water just provides a wonderful window into this. But Emoto has water as something sacred suggesting that it is something from another world. It may well be but the conjecture is presented without foundation."
3,Intriguing,Thought provoking. Interesting pictures. There has been talk that this theory has since been disproven but I still believe in the message.
4,Knowing water,"In this book Emoto explain is view in regard of water.If you want to have a new view on how water respond to our behavior this is the one.It give a good background for many ideas on water from today (Benveniste,Schauberger,Homeopatic,etc),to ancien civilisation knowledge on water.You should be aware that it can change the way you use and see water.Brunobriberdy@dagua.com"
1,Drool-cup available with proof of purchase!,"I'm as open-minded as the next girl, but c'mon folks let's not confuse science with sentiment. The pictures are lovely, but I think some of the analogies being wrought are deeply vested in fantasy-----But hey, mabye the science angle is a bit much but it's a great marketing ploy.who cares if you're blown away, or pissed, as long as that check clears."
1,What Junk!,"If I could give this book zero stars I would.Atoms and molecules, including water, don't know what planet they are on. They follow the laws of physics, not the whims of our emotions."
1,pseudoscience,"Totally ridiculous. A Waste of time, which would be better spent watching paint dry. Unless you are doing research on deluded people. Anyone who believes this claptrap should take a course in rational thinking. I reccomend reading ""Why People Believe Weird Things"", by Michael Shermer."
1,What the?,"Dr. Emoto is not a scientist, nor does he employ such methods in his "" Research "" At best this could be creative photography for junior-high year-book staff, at worst endemic of the break-down of science where charlatans rush wild un-substantiated claims to whore the un-suspecting public's dollars and common sense. One star for ice, none for integrity, and even less for snake-oil practice."
1,Real Scientist,"I wish that Amazon allowed a zero star review. There is a huge difference between being ""open minded"" and being ridiculously naive. If you believed one word in this book, you fall into the second category. Not only is every picture in this book fake and/or altered, there is not a picomole of science in the whole thing. PLEASE don't waste your money and support this abuse of ""open-minded"" (read: foolish) people. These are the same people who think that the bond angle of water can be changed to make your health better and that wearing magnetic bracelets improves your health. I have a theory that eating used kitty litter will increase your metabolism and I know that there are at least 400,000 people who will buy my book when it comes out."
1,Gullibility has no limits,"This is literally incredible. I mean it lacks a scintilla of credibility. How far does someone have to go with wild, speculative, unsupportable, obviously illogical theories before every human being, even the most gullible, would say ""do you think . . . nahh!"" Clearly we as a people are desperate to find meaning, even if we have to impose the most inane theory imaginable on our world. And how convenient that it asks so little of us: Look! We're already mostly water! That alone makes us deep! Please, people: get a grip! We have real problems to address that won't be fixed by feeling all gooey about being all wet."
2,I call Bull....,"Highly unlikely premise. No comment given in the book regarding the actual percentage of crystals sampled. Given the potential for thousands of crystals in a drop of water, how many of these were actually perfectly symmetric when some new-ager meditated over them?We don't know, because ""Dr."" Emoto doesn't mention it in his book.I bet the guy's having a good laugh at the gullible public... as they say, no one's ever gone broke underestimating the intelligence of the public.Dr. Emoto per his own website achived his doctorate from the Open International university, which appears to be a correspondence course.I give 2 stars (despite my high level of suspicion of charlatanism) for the pretty pictures and in a sense, I admire anyone who preys upon New-Agers."
2,"Nice pictures, fun fantasy concepts","Well, the book has pretty pictures, and that's a fun thing. Other than that, it's pretty unrealistic. The information is set up just like Scientology books (Dianetics). There is just enough info. given to the reader so that they fill in the gaps with emotional ideas, and then get them attached to the ideas presented. The book gives them a sort of hope, because they probably have been having a crappy life.One thing that is known about water ALREADY, is that flowing water effects ions. Ions effect people in subtle ways that are still being studied. People in these reviews talk about feeling ""different"" or ""better"" around bodies of water. Well, that's because the ions are charged differently due to the water. It puts some people in a better mood. But this is because of something that can be studied and measured: ionic activity. NOT because the water is in a good mood or was prayed over."
2,"OK, So I'm a Skeptic","First of all, the author's name -- ""Emoto"". Emotion/Emoto. Hmmmn. Second, when water freezes, how many crystals form? One? One million? How many did he select to photograph? The one which ""proved"" his premise?I have the intuitive feeling that this is an elaborate hoax, perpetrated by some Harvard students who are chuckling at my review.Dr. Emoto, indeed.This is a hopeful book, which will be loved by seekers. The rest of us already know that the path to happiness lays within, with an attitude of gratitude -- with a humility which washes over us like.... water."
1,Scientific Method?,"Now we're presenting pretty photos as science. I don't mind the touchy-feely thoughts are powerfull stuff, and I don't mind the skeptical hard facts only stuff... But to mix the two seems to me to tread on dangerous ground. It feeds a certain habit that is more debilitating than healing."
5,Amazing and True!,"This is the most amazing book I've ever read. While I cannot make crystals, I know that much of what he discusses is true. If you've spent any time around a large body of water, you become aware of the different feeling around water. There are different vibrations.Some of what Dr. Emoto discusses involves every day experiences. His explainations make sense and immediately ring true for situations that were once unexplainable.I almost didn't read this book because I was afraid it would be too technical. I'm glad I didn't let that stop me. This book is technical in parts but Dr. Emoto always connects back what he's discovered to practical life. I feel empowered to make changes in my world and positively affect the entire world after reading this book.Some reviewers have blasted this book saying it is bunk. I say to these reviewers, show me your research that contradicts Dr. Emoto's and then we can talk."
2,Nice pictures.,"This book was a huge disappointment. It's the stuff that fairy tales are made of - not science, of any sort. The pictures ARE fascinating but I was looking for much more substance.Skip this one!"
3,Good story,But made for older kids---no pictures! Was disappointed that this kind of story didn't have more illustrations---would have made it much better.
1,"Crap, just crap","Book is highly boring as restates the same thing over and over. There is barely any thrilling action and the dog reads more like a background character than the main one. The book makes me sleep as the lewis and clark story is the most boring of all american history events. And this is of all the crap that is american history. Because they are just so boring. OMG they are traveling west, wow, do I give a ****. Plus just because your american and the story is american doesn't make it great you mother*******. **** you. Hope the book rots in hell."
3,Sandeep rocks........,"Sandeep has written a very enjoyable read. Biographies generally tend to be self congratulatory. This book strikes a balance where the author is generous in spreading encomiums among his team members. The name dropping is subtle. The job hopping and account snatching done by the author was made to look justified.The only slip in the book is that there are no deep dives in to failures. I read this book almost at one go, I am sure you will too, if you a corporate warrior."
5,"My Son Loves This More Than ""Cars""!","When I asked my little guy which character he liked best, he said, ""Meteor! Meteor is the big one that has 6 wheels. He's blue and he's a monster truck and he loves Jesus!"" Later, he built his version of Meteor with Legos, complete with his super cool 6 wheels. Right Turn Races includes 6 episodes. Each episode has a lesson and a bible verse that goes along with it, like the one for Episode 6: 1 John 1:9: ""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.""Right Turn Races is a good 75 minutes long. It's super fun and appropriate for kiddos of all ages. My son loves another series by the same studio so I knew he'd love these. If you have a son or daughter, or any child in your life, who likes Lightning McQueen and Cars, I highly suggest Monster Truck Adventures. Even better because, like my little guy said, these trucks ""love Jesus""!"
3,Excellent reference,This book is very comprehensive and a great refrence book especially when used with Miller's guide to the dissection of the dog. It really helps fill out questions and has color diagrams to aid in understanding.
3,Helpful but wordy,"The pictures are great, however they can lull you into a false sense of security come prac exams. Its incredibly wordy, and until you get used to this after a year or so of study it can be a bit overwhelming."
2,Not as good as the other reviewers think,"The Spirit of Laws is a passionate and eloquent statement of liberalism. But it is only that: a statement. It is not a defence. Montesquieu rails against despotism and carefully spells out the separation of government powers. But, unlike Locke or Mill, he gives little argument for why liberalism should be accepted. And those few sketchy comments he does give (e.g. despotism is bad even for the despot) are unconvincing."
2,"Okay product, terrible company","First of all this product is described as a ""ladies"" size, but it is actually a missy, or junior size. The company describes this item as shipping within 24 hours for instock items. It took a full week for them to ship it out even though it was listed as ""in stock"" the whole time I was waiting for it to finally ship. This caused my Christmas gift to arrive well after Christmas, had it shipped within the 24 hours as the company promised I would have recieved it with time to spare. I sent several emails to this comapny all of which were met with a ""sorry, we are experiencing problems with our email servers and they are down right now please try again later"" This company's level of service was a joke."
5,The perfect follow up to Jaeger's Paideia,"I had the good fortune to read The Classical Tradition right after finishing Werner Jaeger's ""Paideia"" and the two works make an incredibly compelling case for the importance of classical study. Highet does take you on a tour of Western Lit with Greek and Latin authors close by. I learned about The Battle of the Books, the baroque era's rather slavish following of Aristotle's theories and met a whole bunch of authors I had never known (I am also waiting for those Abraham a Santa Clara translations to see if he is as entertaining as Highet makes him out to be)I've read a lot of Highet's books and can tell you there are no duds. I am reading Poets in a Landscape right now and it is hard to put down. Also, check out the surveys of Greek and Latin Literature written by his colleague at Columbia, Moses Hadas."
1,Quickly returned,"I am into a fever of writing reviews on the things we've bought through Amazon tonight ... This microscope, it's been a few years now since we bought it and all I can recall is that neither our kids nor we could get it to work for beans. We sent it right back for a refund."
5,A marvelous book for everyone who is young at heart...,"As a mom, educator and counselor, I am overwhelmed by this book. It is a witty and delightful coming of age story about a young man who teaches us a valuable life lesson .... it makes us think about the cost of being with the ""popular kids""..... a universal issue. This book touches the heart strings of kids (younger and older than junior high) and adults alike.The guided questions lend itself to being in school libraries and classrooms. By discussion, readers can clarify their beliefs in a fun and interesting manner. This book is not judgmental, preachy or moralizing ... it merely teaches through the eyes of an unforgettable character ... Jason Green.For this holiday season, I cannot endorse this book enough."
4,good story,"This is an interesting and well-written book. Jason Green, an overweight teen, makes insightful observations about the world around him. Although the theme is golf, something I'm not particularly interested in, I was drawn in by a story that ultimately tells you that you have to be true to yourself, and loyal to your friends."
4,A nice read,"Hornblower's younger years seem to me the more interesting, and this is close enough in there that the hero is still getting the basics. I enjoyed the book."
2,A waste of ink,"Sometimes it is best to leave well enough alone. This incomplete book should never have been published. It does not really add to the Hornblower saga. Instead, it detracts. The story is unfinished. The written part is in need of editing. I think Forester could have done much more if he did not die first."
2,Could have done without it,"While it is nice to see more of Forester's storyline in writing, I could have done without this book. The beginning does take off where ""Hotspur"" left off, but it was very aggrivating when the story concluded with brief notes about how the author intended the ending to be The short stories in the end appeared to just be thrown in for the sake of filling up pages. I would have liked it better had the book been seperate from the rest of the series. I am baffled why the publisher would make this the fourth book when it contains a short story that takes place when Hornblower is already and Admiral. If you bu the book, just read the first short story that starts after Hornblower leave Hotspur and save the rest for later."
2,Little Brown & Co! What a RIP.,"'Hornblower During the Crisis', is the 4th of the chronological series of Horatio Hornblower's career in the Royal Navy. CS Foresters was unable to complete this book, but there are a few author notes about how the book would end and two interesting short stories at the end of of the 100 pages of 'Hornblower During the Crisis'. I would recommend reading the first short story after 'Mr. Midshipman', and the last short story after you completed the 11 book series.Of course the writing, and continued story line of Horatio Hornblower is superb even with it being a partial book and story. But, I was not particularly happy that this partiallly completed book of 100 pages cost the same as any other book in the series. I give the rating of 2 stars only due to this fact.Otherwise, I will still continue to look forward to reading the next in the series. I am very much addicted to the story line!"
3,Three Novellas,"""During the Crisis"" features three novellas by C.S. Forester. The first, best and the only incomplete novella is the first which occurs after ""Hornblower and the Hotspur"". The second occurs sometime after Mr. Midshipman and Lieutenant Hornblower. The third, I think (I have not completed the entire series yet) should be one of the last things read about HH. I don't know how Forester intended on introducing these three well written, but very chronologically disjointed pieces into the life of HH, but it would seem that his estate put together his remaining notes about HH and published it under the title ""During the Crisis"". My suggestion to anyone who is reading the Hornblower series for the first time is to pick this book up and read the sections after you have read the books in the order I have mentioned them. Reading this before I read Lieutenant Hornblower would have been enlightening."
2,A book for the completist,"I am just reading the Hornblower series for the first time and reading them in the publishers order. Hornblower During The Crisis is an unfinished book, seriously unfinished, the main story only runs 129 pages and would have been wonderful if he had finished the novel (the author passed away). Bundled with 2 other very short stories this book really isn't worth the price."
3,Unfinished Work is a dissapointment,"This book is unfinished by the author. The basis of the story is quite compelling. If it was finished, it would be a great link in the Hornblower chain of books. However, it was a dissapointment to have to guess on how the story would twist and turn leading to the battle of Trafalgar. At the least, I believe that the publisher should discount the price on this volume. However, avid followers of Hornblower must read this to follow along Hornblower's life."
3,Would've been a good novel but the best part wasn't written.,"This novel picks up with Hornblower relinquishing command of the Hotspur and returning to London for a new command. As typical in a Forester novel, nothing ever goes as planned and action follows Hornblower on his way home from a supply ship. There are only about 150 pages of text in this story and what was missing in the story were what Hornblower did that lead to the eventual decisive Battle of Trafalgar. It was nice to see what Forester wrote anyway only because I like the genre and I like Forester's details and descriptions of being in the Service and living during that time. But this book wouldn't be good on its own."
2,Digital version does not include the short stories,"I did enjoy the unfinished story, although it its of course sad that we can never enjoy the fully finished work. I was very frustrated to learn that the Kindle digital version did not include the two companion short stories. Seeing their mention time and again in these reviews, I had no idea they would be left out. These were the deciding factor in my decision to purchase this book. This should have been noted in the description."
2,Beginning of a Great Story...,"I give this book two stars, but in no way am I implying that C.S. Forester deserves two stars for his work. Rather, I give the publisher of the book two stars for giving us half a novel but presenting it as a full entry in the Hornblower saga. I was looking forward to another great Hornblower novel, but found instead the beginnings of a promising story and a few short stories. The whole edition is much shorter than the other Hornblower novels, but costs the same price. I would recommend skipping this book until you have really exhausted the other Hornblower novels already."
4,Cosmic Christ/Creation/Life,"A must read for any fallin' away Catholics. Sadly, those within the confines of the Roman Catholic Church would benefit greatly by one reading. I learned more in a few pages about my own God-Given sexuality than I have learned in my whole life of searching for Truth and where Creator plays into Sexuality. Mother Earth needs this knowledge to come forth in our lives to protect the planet and ourselves."
1,The name of God and his doctrine are not to be blasphemed.,"The writer of this book is referred to indirectly in the Word of God: ""If any man teach [false doctrine] ... he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself."""
1,Tired Heresies,"A tired attempt to re-run the ancient heresy of Gnosticism. May impress ignoramuses who know nothing of theology. I attended Fox's lectures in Western Australia a few years ago. They were an incoherent babble of scientific gobbledegook, historical nonsense and psychological trickery. I am not a Catholic but I don't wonder the Catholic Church unfrocked him."
3,RUR,THis book is a play written about Artificial intelligence. It is very short and doesn't take much to read it. I would recommend it to a younger audience.
1,Kindle Version not in English,"Apart from the quality of the play, the Kindle edition of this product is in the original Czech, but claims to be in English."
2,RUR has not aged well,"Steeped in early 20th century morality and Old Testament biblical references, I found this a hard play to like. A lot of the dialog is particularly incredible, and demeaning to scientists and women. Of course, the woman in story is made out to be an airhead who can't possibly understand the issues involved.Certainly unique in its time, it doesn't track into the 21 century. Read Asimov's robot chronicles,, which still hold up very well.I did like the linked TOC and the electronic presentation in genersl..."
4,Really a survivor!,"JLW,is one of that artists that needed much audience of the bluesfans. He's a Bay Area guy,but influenced by Chicago blues,his style mixing R&B,pop,soul... shows a passionate work.The track 5,is simply the best of this cd,'Bad Thing' of Sarah Brown... Really a good job of this fantastic bluesman!"
1,He cant Market,"This book is about Marketing, not really about advertising or PR which is fine.....but its so bad. There is a ton of spreadsheets you have to fill in but you need to know very specific information to do so, and then the information you get is only relevant to a larger cooperation. Also, and this is the kicker, the author made a reference to an exciting new ad technology coming out, Google Whisper, and he was serious. He was not kidding, he actually thought Goole Whisper was real, its an ONION STORY, you know ""The Onion"" the fake news site that makes up funny fake stories, the author thought one of them was real, and put it in his book."
1,No idea what the author is talking about,"I have no idea what the author is talking about - it's just the way the book is written. It seems to just start from nowhere. It's either the author is assuming the reader already knows a huge amount about marketing planning or just seems to put down thoughts as they come to mind. I reached Chapter 7 (with skipping some material in between) but can go no further. I read a lot books on management and marketing - this book has just confounded me. Luckily I got it from the library and didn't buy it. I just finished reading one excellent bookThe New Rules of Marketing and PR: How to Use Social Media, Blogs, News Releases, Online Video, and Viral Marketing to Reach Buyers Directly, 2nd Edition& this book was quite a let down after that."
2,Disappointed,"Having just read Vanishing Florida by David T. Warner, I was anticipating another look into a native's perspective of old Florida. While Warner's book was engaging, enlightening and entertaining, this one was not. It was mostly a dry historical perspective of the author's family which wasn't that interesting."
4,"Entertaining, despite being about Florida","I never did like Florida. Reading a book about this place would never have entered my mind, but while visiting a Floridian cousin, she gave me a copy as a going away present. When I eventually got around to it, I found it very enjoyable. It was quite interesting learning about the history of this area, and her writing style drew me in. Perhaps the author's less-than-glowing assessment of Florida is what hooked me, but just the same I read it cover to cover. It left me with more of an impression of what the real Florida is, not just Mouse Land and the Transplant Coasts. Though I'd never, ever want to live there, I enjoyed this book."
1,The author must be an extremely annoying snob.,"For a history book, the research and footnotes were not very substantial. Historians have been getting a lot of negative publicity lately for less that exemplary scholarhip. Since this is not a very important book it will not be scrutinized the way Doris Kerns Goodwin or Joseph J.Ellis would be if they were to write about Florida. I felt like someone was snearing at me throughout the book. It seemed more like a big long blog. I'd love to read more about Florida history since so many friends live there now, but I truly hated this book."
1,Bad Business,I am a soldier who is currently deployed overseas and i have ordered this product twice from amazon and have never recieved either one of them and would never use amazon again.
2,Uncomfortable,"This life vest is fine except for one very serious flaw - even if you are a pencil neck geek the cut out for your neck is still going to squeeze you uncomfortably. When they fix this it will be a winner, but in the meantime look at the Stearns instead."
5,Good PFD Vest For The Money,"If you buy this and are expecting a top of the line PFD that you can wear all day and not notice that you have on, you most likely will be disappointed. This is a vest that is designed to be used with tubes or other devices towed behind a boat. It will also work well for some larger children (teens) that don't fit into a regular children's vest. We bought them to use with a tube towed behind our boat, 4 different people have had them on and all of them were satisfied with the comfort and performance.Good purchase if you need an inexpensive vest that is going to take some wear and fit a fairly wide range of people."
3,runs VERY small,I'm a small dude.This vest runs VERY small. It's uncomfortable to have the top buckle closed. This top buckle is not adjustable.
4,"Good fit, good price, comfortable","I always wear my vest when kayaking. It does not interfere with my paddling and is very comfortable, not being uncomfortably warm, even here in sunny, humid Florida. I haven't fallen out of my kayak yet, so I can't give testimony to it effectiveness."
3,"Good As Most; ""Handling"" Costs Add No Value","The jackets themselves are fine. A retired coast guard captain recently suggested to me that cheap ""Mae West"" style jackets are better since they hold up the head of unconscious victims, unlike the vest design.Some other higher visibility colors, particularly dayglow and/or fluorescent (glow in the dark) would be a good idea. This is especially in light of the price, which I now realize is artificially high. Shipping/handling fees bring up the price dramatically; I just wish I hadn't been in such a hurry before buying such common items. Please check local retailers (heck, even K-Mart!) before assuming that since these are the best bargains on Amazon, that it's about the best you can do.Quality seems okay in and of itself, though."
2,Very small and cheap,I was not expecting much from this jacket at this price and still it was dissapointing when I saw this thing. It says it fits the average size adult more like the average size 10 year old. It is poorly made if you are looking for a life jacket to actually use or have for someone else to use I would not suggest this item. If you are just looking for something to fill your boat and meet the appropriate number of vest to match your passengers hope if you do need to use this jacket there is someone who weighs less than a hundred pounds on your boat so this jacket can be helpful.
2,NOT TRUE TO SIZE,The vest says X20 Adult Life jacket! More like x20 BOY jacket. Too small. I am currently returning it.
1,definitely not for adults,"I ordered two of these vests. One for myself and one for my wife. It didnt fit either of us. I'm 5'6, 157lbs and my wife is 5'3, 120lbs (just to give you an idea that we are not big in size), still it was way too small for both of us. The quality is alright for the money, but it's definitely not an adult jacket. The product title is misleading, hence the 1 star. The return was hassle free and easy."
5,Good Vest,"Not the greatest in the world, and if I was going out on the ocean I would think twice about it, but for lake use with out Hobie Cat it's perfect and does a good job for the price."
4,Perfect for an inexpensive life vest,The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is that the front has 2 peices of foam inside instead of just one so that's kind of strange but not really important. I like the vest
4,Nice for a extra life jacket,A little harder than I thought but good for the price. Would have liked it better without the print on it. Fits well for most average size women.
3,Nothing exceptional,"To be honest, I would likely return these if I had allowed enough time to do so. They reflect their inexpensive price. My own fault for being cheap! Don't get me wrong, they will do the job but are not high quality! They will do the job for extra life vests at the cabin, I wouldn't suggest them if you are looking for a comfortable product that you will use frequently!"
4,Decent for the price!,"This is a great vest to have on the boat as an extra. Differently good to swim around with, but I wouldn't try to wakeboard in it. Doesn't feel like it will hold up extremely well. It's also not meant for a large person. I know it's universal but I would say it truly a size medium and pushing a large. The bottom two straps adjust just fine it's the top strap that limits the size. You can't adjust the top strap so if you have a wide chest it's going to be very uncomfortable."
4,Worked very well for price,"The PFDs were delivered quickly and were exactly what I ordered. I am a 6 foot man and they fit me very well. Not restrictive, easy to adjust the size. I wear it at all times while in the canoe. I would have given it 5 stars for being a just-fine PFD at a nice low price, however I have never gone swimming in it so I can't say how it would feel if I really needed it. Would buy another. Note that there is a large logo permanently printed on the back."
4,Life vest,"Bought 2 of these, for 2 small adults. Feared they would be too bulky, but not so. Plenty of room around the armholes and neck. Haven't had to test their flotation yet, but they are probably as comfortable as generic life vests can be, and a good value for the occasional boating excursion."
2,"Disappointing transfer, especially coming from Criterion","I have quite a library of Criterion DVDs and have come to expect quality transfers from this company. There have been a couple of duds, including the very bad transfer of The Scarlet Empress. But The Drum, one of the films in this set, is incredibly bad. It has terrible definition and colors that look like that have gone through a washing machine. Film is almost unwatchable. It looks like a third rate, public domain DVD that you can find at bargain basement prices."
2,Not for MIDI users,"The DJX-1 (PSRD1-DJX) was a great keyboard. I suggest you look for one of those on ebay or something. In many ways the DJX-2 is a stripped down version of the original. The sounds are fine and you can record your own beats and samples etc, but if you want to use it in a MIDI setup, forget it. Its ""MIDI out"" capability is only for saving your samples to a computer --- you cannot use the DJX-2 to output note information to an external sequencer (or computer or other keyboard...). Also, the DJX-2 does not include the industry standard set of 128 general MIDI (GM) voices. And who wants to look at alternating gray and white octaves???"
4,My first Chick Corea Album,"As my first introduction to Chick Coreas' music, this album is just so amazing , a really beautiful, unique creation. The Sax playing is particularly inspiring."
4,Candiru- Unloved and Weeded Out,This album is an experimental ride of noise and guitar writhing perfection. Slow fast medium loud low high dark unique!
4,Focus Is Not the Focus of This Camera,"This camera is great, wonderful, one of the best on the market...if not for that pesky auto focus feature. I was surprised at how well the video feature works; it's not the same quality you're going to get with a stand alone video camera, but it's not bad either. My may beef with this camera is the auto focus...sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't; I noticed that it's usually out of focus in indoor/night shots when optical zoom is being used. For the most part, this can be fixed by putting it on a tripod."
4,Kodak EasyShare,Great price for the product. Seller provided the necessary information before the purchase of the Kodak EasyShare DX7590 Camera and Dock Bundle. Had a need for existing Kodak printer to work with this camera and dock. Kodak tech support was not very good in assisting me with this challenge. This seller was efficient in the product they sold.
2,Kodak Easy Share DX7590 camera,"I bought this camera for my daughter for her to take pictures of the kids and send them to me. She recently moved 1,000 miles away.I wanted for her to have a reliable camera. The camera came with the wrong battery but she thought that it was the old battery and needed replacement. She wanted to take pictures right away so she searched around the city and found a charger but that battery still did not work.She finally purchased another battery on line for the camera and when it arrived it was a different battery. The camera was sold with the wrong battery.I emailed the seller and we came up with an adjusted price. He was going to make an adjustment in my Amazon account but I am not sure if it has happened yet.My daughter is very happy with the camera. I feel bad that she had to run around so much to mqke a gift work."
2,"Great Pictures, but can't get them off the camera","I love the pictures this thing takes. Some of them look like they were taken by professionals for national geographic. But they were just pictures of my cat.But I have a HUGE problem with the PC interface. You have to use Kodak's software to transfer to a PC. With my olympus, I just hooked in the USB cable, went to My Computer, found the camera, then dragged and dropped the photos where I wanted them. No large programs to load, no creating albums, no setting default options, etc. Just drag and drop using the windows explorer interface. The so called ""easy""share software won't allow that.So I find myself using my old olympus, because after all, I'm just taking pictures of my cat."
3,Don't be fooled but enjoy it anyway,"I have played these various recordings against the studio originals & my conclusion......they are the studio originals. Occasionally edited, with the balance of the recording changed here & there then with the announcements & applause added. Just check the end of of El Manicero, it's just to suspious. This sort of thing was a pretty popular thing to do in those far off days. Still if you got to have everything by one of the greatest artists of all times then better add this one to the list"
5,One to watch every now and then.,I just saw this movie on cable tonight... I've seen it before many times... You can always tell a movie is great... When it stands the test of time... I've decided to buy this film on DVD.... Keep it close in your thoughts...
4,A Bronx Tale DVD Review,I love this movie. It's a poignant coming of age story set against the backdrop of racial tensions in the 1960's. De Niro did a nice job in his directorial debut with Chazz Palminteri's script.
5,a true Bronx tale,"My Italian neighbor recommended this movie. She said, ""If you want to know what my childhood on Author Ave was like watch this movie."" I was very hesitant, I'm very picky and critical when it comes to movies but I decided to give it a try. I loved it. The message is a very good one and it's it very entertaining. It's one of those movies you talk about after watching."
2,"""C"" runs like a female duck","The scenes where Calogero runs are just sad to me. The poor guy has obviously never been a normal kid. He looks ridiculous. This is why the Fonz never ran on ""Happy Days""."
2,BLAH!!!,"This movie is way over-hyped and i have changed my mind about this movie........this is a love story gone wrong......this does not belong in a collection of mob movies.....i am a mob movie collector and this movie just doesn't cut it......this may please your girlfriend.....this is almost comparable to Chaz's performance in Boss of Bosses, IT [WAS BAD]....!!!"
2,Too phony,"This film is way too superficial and phony. It tries to ""moralize"" too much, and none of the characters comes across as believable. One of the worst movies of all time."
1,Sad,"I purchased 2 movies A Bronx Tale. 1 was not connected to the DVD case, it was just flopping around. I bought the movies for an x-mas gift and was sad when I had to give one that wasn't perfect. It was broken in the case. This made me sad and second guessing the purchase of anything else from the internet. I was not given instructions on how to return it so I'm stuck with it.Sad but true. I gave it away so too late now."
5,gift for my mother,"This was a gift for my mother so I cannot rate the quality of the DVD, however shipment was fast and very easy."
5,Love this movie....,"Short & sweet, awesome movie, even better soundtrack. The acting is immpecable. Robert De Niro as always, is great, I love to see him in a role where he's not the wise guy. Chaz Palmenteri is so handsome in this movie. Again the music for me, makes the movie."
5,Matty D's Review,"This is an honest plot , well supported by Robert DeNiro's superb acting and directing. It has a little mob-action, romance , family values , comedy and violence. An astonishing mix in just another ""Bronx Tale""."
1,A Bronx Tale ( Movie),This Movie has been my Favorite Movie Forever. When I Found it Here on Amazon I was super excited. So I bought the Movie Brand New Supposley. When I opened the Movie It Turned out to be a knock off Movie you can record From Your Computer. I'm Extreamly upset to have Paid 17.99 For a Boot Leg Movie. It was wraped like other movies you find when you open it You can tell it was made in a house. I want a Re-Fund. I don't Believe in Stealing. The Humanity of people on a hustle!! Do not Buy Any Movies. I will Get word around.
5,This is a good movie!,Because there weren't 7 stars. (smile) It was a good movie that I watched over and over again. I liked everything about the movie. Would recommend it to all.
1,a bronx tale,It was horrible. Not a clear picture it was dark. The movie seemed very bootleg. I would not recommend purchasing anything from this dealer. It am not happy and it was for a christmas gift.
4,"""We asked you to leave...""","""You open the car door for her and then you walk around the back of the car to see whether or not she unlocks the car door for you, that's how you tell whether or not she's a good girl."" That may not be the exact quote, but you get the gist. If you didn't know that that was the world's perfect litmus test before seeing the movie, you have the most amazing ah ha moment when you first here it explained in the movie. And when you start to think about it, that's when you remember, he's right. This is a great movie!"
4,Terrific directorial debut,"For a directorial debut, Deniros first is impressive. The story takes place in of course, the Bronx, about a bus driver and his kid growing up. Deniro does not overblow the movie....and does capture realistically the street humor and language that makes it very realistic.It might not be a Scorsese or Coppola film, but its very very respectable just the same. Give it a look, its very good!!"
4,Only thing 'Exclusive' is Omitted 'Subtitle'!!,"Of course, I have seen 'A Bronx Tale' several times on television, which is why I purchased it. So, I undoubtingly, love the movie! Which is why I was excited about the opportunity of purchasing same. The quality is really good. Yet, advising it as 'Exclusive' is a bit much; especially one with no 'Subtitle'. How can an 'Exclusive' be a copy? Too expensive to be a copy! Feel jacked!A Bronx Tale (Amazon.com Exclusive)"
5,A Bronx Tale,I loved this movie. I gave this dvd to a friend as a Birthday present.The acting was ove the top.
5,Another one of my favorites,Great story and message...great acting...creates the feel of the era very well and all the characters are believable and well portrayed. Highly recommended.
5,HAPPY CUSTOMER,THANK YOU SO MUCH! I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR QUITE SOMETIME & WASNT ABLE TO FIND IT TIL NOW. TURN AROUND TIME TO RECIEVE MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC! THANKS AGAIN!
5,A Bronx Tale,"This is a semi autobiography of Chazz palminteri who wrote this movie based on his play.the most interesting part to me was Calogero's racist friends Slick and Crazy Mario they chased that bus and they got worse as teenagers.Sonny was a better friend because he and C weren't prejudiced.But great music,songs and scenes in this movie I was totally intertained."
5,She better unlock my door!,Kid growing up near the influence of the mob gets lured in. Sometimes its a good thing... sometimes not!
3,A Gangsta Plot with a Beautiful Romantic Story Intertwined,"This was a well put together movie. The characters, setting, and plot were easy to follow and it provide for a pleasurable viewing experience. On the down side the strong language in the movie made it a turn off for me. I loved this movie when it eared on cable networks with the strong language removed, but as a DVD and VHS movie it made my ears cringe."
2,I wish...,"I'm not sure if this is a fair review,,, the seller did send it in a timely matter... it was new like it said and it was fairly priced. I bought it for a friend who brought it back to me saying... it won't play on our player, It has a code lock on it. So I don't know what I can do."
3,GOOD BUT GETS OVER COMPLICATED,"This book is a good rather than a great read. The story got a little over complicated as Chandler tries to tie in and link too many threads - all connected to the gigantic villain Moose Malloy. There were times when I scratched my head a little despairingly as I tried to work out what these connections were. There were also times when sentences and paragraphs made no logical sense to me at all. I put this down to the language of the time but it did leave a feeling of bewilderment.However, I did enjoy this book and the character of Marlow is strong and amusing. His one liners did on occassions grate a little but nevertheless his overwhelming sense of optimism rang through and made me laugh.Although written many years ago - it still had quite a modern feel to it."
2,Best Left Unread,"If you like incomprehensible story lines, improbable plots and connections and an overtone of misogyny then this is your book.If not this is book best left unread."
5,good stuff,It's nice to read a mystery novel without all the blood and violence that are part of today's fiction. The writer's ability to create the suspense and keep the reader interested is what makes good novels. This is GOOD!
2,disappointing audio production,"This review is for the CD version of Eliot Gould's reading.I love Chandler's writing and have read ""Farewell"" at least four times. Gould does a good job of reading it, too.What's frustrating about the CD version is that the disks are not indexed. There was no effort to make a disk begin at the beginning of a chapter, for instance. Also, each disk holds one track only. That means if you want to pause for the night at the end of chapter 5, good luck finding your place when you return to listening in a few days.Breaking the audio into tracks is a very easy thing to do, so primitive a technology that it makes it seem that this CD box set was mastered in the 1980s.There is no competing product as of June 2003, however. Devotees may want to make their own MP3 files and then donate the CDs to a library."
2,Let The Buyer Beware,"Although this book is well written and informative (almost a bit TOO light-hearted in fact), it is not going to allow you to pass the A+ exams...in fact, this and a number of books combined might not be enough. The Comptia exams for A+ certification changed AGAIN after the release of this book and there are several questions on the A+ exam that you will be totally clueless about if you rely on the text and, even more so, the CD-ROM sample tests in this book. The CD tests contained therein are simplistic and do not cover hardly a thing that's contained in the actual test...in fact, the CD tests in this book don't even test you on much of anything you were to learn from the book...just 49 random questions that will have you staring at the screen during a Comptia A+ exam wondering what in the world they mean by that...very disappointing considering I once beleived this was THE book to use to pass the A+ exams."
4,Good...not great,"This book was very good but it didn't cover everything on the exam. I took the practice exams on the included CD and did great on the Core Hardware, and just passed the OS. On the actual exam I just passed the Hardware and failed the OS. It definitely helped a lot but I will be looking for other sources before I retake the test."
2,Not worth the money,"I was really disappointed with this book. I have the impression that it is the result of a quick update to its older edition without being focused on the newer material on the A+ exams. Lot's of history and cute drawings, but also lots of errors. I also used Ron Gilster's A+ Certification For Dummies, which I felt did a better job in actually getting me ready for the tests."
5,Best Book To Buy,"I read an earlier edition of this book when I was 17 2 years ago, took about a month but contains everything you would cover on the test. I passed the test and am now A+ certified."
1,Don't buy the outdated version!,"The writting is great, but this version is outdated! It is for the 1998 test objectives that were retired in March! Buy the Fifth Edition of this book."
3,CD could be much better,"The overall book is OK; the chapters are broken down into specific subject areas and are informative. One of the main reasons I purchased this book was for the tests on the CD; there are only 45 test questions on the entire CD! This was extremely disappointing and a rip-off. If you're looking for a good CD supplement, DON'T buy this book."
4,Not perfect but very close,"This book was my major source of information and although it had a few errors it was the book with the least errors of the 4 that I read. This book goes into a little more detail than the test requires but it is very thorough and great for a beginner. Although it was my favorite, I would not recommend this book as your only study material if you are a beginner."
2,Not-So-Good,"Well, this book covers it all,but all of the typos in the review questions are just unbelievable. Those that have read it know what I'm talking about. And as others have noted, the software basically stinks. Just to run the practice exams, I had to download a patch and hope for the best. Well I took my Core Hardware exam last week and thank god the server went down toward the end, because the practice tests that came with the book were nothing like the actual test. So I left and reverted to Trancender Study material which is very much like the test. I dont recommend this book, its a lot of reading to find out it didnt help at all."
4,Buy this book NOW!,"The book is easy to read with good analogies, the book can be better illustrated but in general a good book with a lot of information that is presented in an easy to understand format.Excellent for the beginner, may be a little too slow if you have more than 4 yrs of break/fix experience."
1,A+ all in one.. Not quite,I bought this book hoping that it would help me vastly in getting my A+ certification. I read the book cover to cover and did all the practice exams many times. I took the core hardware part of the test and passed. I read the book's O/S part over and over again until i couldnt take it anymore and went up for the test. None of the questions in the book matched up to the real A+ test. So i just figured i didnt study it enough and pick up enough so i read it all through again and again until i could practically recite the book from memory and i failed again. This book goes into details about topics that it does not need to and it just a waste of you time when it comes to the O/S part. It helped somewhat on the hardware part of the test. Do not just use this book as your primary means of studying for the A+ exam.
3,"Good on Hardware, Not so Good on OS","I just took the A+ exam and passed. I used this book and some internet rescources (certyourself.com, cramsession.com). This book did a great job of preparing me for the Hardware exam but did not do the same for the OS exam. I scored 1041 on hardware, but only 641 on the OS. There were a lot of questions on Win2K that were not covered in this book. I found myself seeing many things on the test for the first time and feeling rather dumb. Good book for an introduction, but you will probably need more reinforcement on Win2K unless you have used it extensively."
2,Do you like antique equipment?,"I teach a college course in computer hardware and used Mr. Meyers' book. There were a few minor technical errors, but noting major. What I had a problem with was the intensity with which he covered older technology and operating systems, and then glazed over material that my students would see later on the exams. I have subsequently moved over to a different book."
3,Caveat Emptor,"Although the core portion of the book was written well with good illustrations, this is only 50% of the certification. The remaining Dos/Windows portion of the exam is covered in only three chapters with one chapter on memory management. I passed both exams, but only with the aid of two other references. By reading three different books, I got a much better understanding of everything and as a result found numerous mistakes in this particular text. Sorry Mr. Meyers, you don't get an A+ on this book. Trust me, it is not an ""all-in-one"" exam guide."
3,Please,The book is great..good detail. But if you are like me you got this package because of the software and price compared to others on the market..Well be informed you only get 100 questions on the CD and they want you to spend another 80 bucks for the so called hundreds of questions..I am kinda angry and think im gonna return it..
4,Outdated,"While a technically excellent book, this edition covers topics for the 1998 A+ tests that were retired on March 30, 2001. Mike Meyers has a third edition out, which is the one to get to prepare to take the present tests."
4,"HARDWARE SECTION IS BEST, OS IS ONLY AVERAGE","I PASSED BOTH THE HARDWARE AND OS EXAMS MAY 28, 2002.I USED THIS BOOK TO PREPARE FOR THE TESTS. MIKE DID A GOOD JOB ON HARDWARE SECTION, ESPECIALLY ON CPU, MEMORY, AND MOTHERBOARD. THE OS SECTION HOWEVER IS DISORGANIZED. I WAS LOST WHEN READING DOS, WINDOW 9X, AND WINDOWS 2000 CHAPTERS. THIS BOOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHORTER, TOO LONG.OTHER A+ BOOKS (LIKE THE ONE WRITTEN BY DAVID GROTH) ARE EVEN WORSE. FOR THIS REASON,I STILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND MIKE'S BOOK. THE QUALITY OF THIS BOOK IS NOT UP TO MY EXPECTATION. HOWEVER, AS I SAID, IT IS STILL THE BEST COMPARED TO OTHER A+ BOOKS."
4,Great study guide,"This book follows the format of the revised Network+ exam very closely. One would probably be able to pass the exam using just this book in combination with some previous knowledge and/or experiance. However, I would recommend picking up Tamara Dean's Network+ book to fill in some of the areas not covered closely enough by Meyers, such as Remote Access, WAN technologies and Network Troubleshooting. Also, the end of chapter questions in this book are weak at times, and do not accurately represent the difficulty of the exam itself. The tests on the CD-ROM are a good practice tool."
3,Test prep book that isn't up to standards,"No doubt about it, it's a textbook. I read it through thoroughly, and as a person wanting to just pass the test, it's not up to expectations. It teaches the material fully, but unless you have a lot of time to read and absorb all the in depth material, it probably isn't for you. By no means is it a cram book, as it covers pretty much everything with many small details the A+ exam doesn't even ask for. If you want to be a good tech, read this book. If you're in need of certification fast and need to pass the test, I suggest using this with a test prep book (I found ""A+ Adaptive Exams"" to be a good book) or not using this at all."
4,"Some errors, missing some points, overall allowed me to pass","I took the new 2001 exams today and passed them both (690 Core, 791 OS). Unfortunately there were some serious errors in this book (like the viewable size of a monitor is not the glass!), but overall very good. I should note that the quiz program that comes with the book is also poor and doesn't really prep you for the real exam because the real 2001 exam is 70 questions and 1.5 hours. Also, a note about the hardware exam: I should have done much better but the new 2001 exams have graphics that are impossible to decipher (like identify the *blank* in this graphic). Even if you got 92%+ in practice exams (like I did), study more because you're doomed on these questions. Aside from that, I would recommend this book, as all I did was spend about 30 hours reading the book and about an hour or so before each exam going over what I highlighted!"
4,"Not a Rookie but, Not a Master either.....","I bought the book for PC Maintenance course I am taking in Tech College(recommended text for class). I've had 6 months of formal training in PC repair, not to mention the LearnKey 7 cd bundle by Michael Meyers, and the book by Michael Meyers. I failed pretty bad. This is no pansy test by any means. Use the book as a learning source, not exam prep. I have learned much about computers which is good. I feel confident enough to say I have the tech experience of a someone who has 6 months experience. However, according to COMPTIA, I still have much to learn. I did express to COMPTIA that the test seemed a little more geared to someone with a great deal more experience and time in this field. Oh yeah, just to let you know, I took the Cisco CCNA Exam 640-407 and passed with an 869. This COMPTIA A+ Exam made the Cisco Exam seem like a walk in the park. I prepared just as hard for both. Nevertheless, great book for beginners, not for exam prep."
5,Want to be A+ .... you need this Book!!!,"This book is easy to read , even its not your primary language. Have a lot of pictures and examples I really recommended !! ATT. Agenor Marrero A+"
5,Highly Recommended,"Great book for beginners! After failing the two exams initially, I bought this book after reviewing many of the recommendations from previous buyers. This book helps explain some of the more complex facts on Core & Dos/Windows in terms that I believe the average person will be able to understand. If you have no or minimal computer experience, I would use this book as an additional study supplement. This book along with Transcenders makes for a powerful combination to help you pass the the A+ exams. My only regret is that I wish I had purchased this book before taking the exams the first time."
3,I passed the A+ Exam...,"This book is ok to study with,however, do not waste your time studying the chapter on DOS memory because there were absolutely no questions on the exam. The primary focus of the A+ OS section Win NT/2000 and 9x.I have 2 big beefs with this book. First, the CD with test questions was impossible to install on my home computer. I'm not an idiot and I have a lot of experience working on computers so I know it wasnt a user error problem. Second, there is NO chapter ending summary and review questions in the book. Instead, you have to read entire chapters line by line and highlight the info you think is important. Which makes no sense if you have to cram right before taking the test.I recommend that you buy another A+ book in addition to this one. Maybe A+ for dummies for its conciseness. Also, subscribe to an A+ newsgroup."
3,Where are all the questions?,"**Not enough questions on the CD** Its always a little worrying when the front of the cover says that the CD contains hundreds of questions only to find that to get any more than 100 from the CD, you have to pay another $80. The book is comprehensive - but lets face it - with 100 questions it is very poor in terms of practice test."
4,A+ CD-Rom in Meyers' Third Edition,"I have read some chapters in the book and it will definitely help me in passing the A+ Exam. However, the CD-Rom is much less impressive, I am running Win'98 and unable to view the contents on the CD-Rom I would love to see the contents but the warranty is limited and not much help is available in replacing this bad batch that has been duplicated which I find to be very disappointing in that in buying books the software is usually the bonus for such a purchase. If any reader out there can assist please email: Ozm43@cs.com ; Going to Totalsems website has not been very useful but all in all the book is a good buy for reading; it maintains ones interest in getting certified for A+."
1,Thanks For Nothing!,"I bought this book with high hopes, but came away EXTREMELY disapointed.After reading the entire book,taking all the practice exams,studying and re-reading the book for over a month,getting between 750-800 on the cd-rom exams, I took the real exam today and failed..badly. This book's long-winded text and too simple practice exams gave me just enough confidence to get led to slaughter. I was completely unprepared for the A+ exam.The Questions in the real A+ exam barely even resembled anything I studied in this book.The cd -rom stinks too, It locks up most of the time,and is filled with typo's, and even gives a couple of wrong answers! Can someone in the real world help me pass this test?"
4,pros and cons of this book,"hi there:well, lets cut it short.1. the book is very detail. 2. poor picture quality. 3. you'll need an exam guide after studying this book.(they've included CD-ROM for the exam purpose, but it's not enough) 4. easy to understand.that's all"
3,Check Out - www.totalsem.com/support/errata/aplus5.htm,Before purchasing the book you should access www.totalsem.com/support/errata/aplus5.htmThis webpage show errors and give the corrections for errors in the Fifth Edition of the All In One A+ Certification Book.
1,Cheese-o-Rama.,"Well, I love independent film and I love little guy directors but Me & Michael has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. When contemplating the reason why it is so awful one can only conclude that this fellow has very, very little talent. This account of his career as a videographer in LA reeks of perpetual illegitimacy. A lot of what is supposed to be live footage is obviously staged and his impersonation of foreigners is totally cheesy. As a matter of fact, everything about the movie is totally cheesy. You almost feel sorry for the guy, but can't because the venture is so misguided that it's hard not to wonder how he missed all the glaring indicators that he will never be a success in the glitterati business. Oh well, at least it is short. Yet this hour drags by painfully. I can't believe anyone, and I mean anyone, could give it a decent rating."
1,where is my stuff????????,I've been waiting september 29th 2011. I can't find tracking information so where is it?I only know that's shipped!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Cards ok!,"Cards are ok, but would have liked the book that goes with this deck, also would prefer deck larger."
4,Old and New Path,"I just recently bought this deck. I'm very interested in Wicca so I wanted a deck that reflected the Wicca feeling. And it does.I bought this deck after reading several reviews, some of them talked about little bits of silver on the major cards. This seems to be the case only with OLDER decks. The new decks don't have any silver. This was a bit disappointing for me, but I still think this is a beautiful deck.The majors are very well done. But the amount of white on the minor cards takes some getting used to, and they could have been nicer if they had a bit more colour. Some of the mouths on the minor cards look weird, and the teeth are a bit strange. But the eyes are great, really well done.The cards are very detailed; I see something new every time I look at them. I would recommend this deck, but it might be nicer to get an older, secondhand, deck; with the bits of silver on it."
4,Sturdy Grater,"This is a sturdy, well made grater. I haven't used it for hard cheeses, but it does an excellent job on cheddar, carrots, apples, etc. The non-skid base is nice, as is the padded hand grip. Nice enough to leave on the counter."
3,cheese grater,"I was a little disappointed in that this product was supposed to have a non-stick surface. The only thing that was non stick was the base and the handle. The product worked as well as any other product, maybe a little better in that it had 4 sides to use to grate. However, it did not serve the purpose that I had hoped."
4,"Works perfectly, just a bit oversized","This cheese grater works exactly as a cheese grater should...only very minor complaint is that it is a bit larger than what I had always thought of as the ""standard"" box grater...and as a result is a little more bulky to store in my cabinet, which is a bit tight on space. Aside from that, this was a great value for the price."
1,Not good - do not buy this,"Bought this grater as a gift for my daughter and was alarmed when it arrived. The rubber handle and nonskid gasket on the bottom had a very heavy petroleum/moth ball (naphthalene) like odor, which persisted despite several washings and airing in the sun. As a matter of fact, it stunk up the entire dishwasher when first washed, and the odor in the dishwasher remained for several days. The size is also huge - much bigger than expected, and therefore not easy to store. I would have returned it had we not washed it, but instead had to toss it into the trash. The odor must certainly be toxic."
1,The rubber material is horrible! It smells terrible.,"Avoid at all costs. What I thought looked like a good product in the picture, has completely disappointed me. The rubber handle and rubber sleeve on the bottom are made of some nasty rubber material that literally stinks and does not stop stinking. I've had rubber mallets made of the same rubber and the smell never, ever goes away. Bad product."
5,"Great product, sturdy and does the job","Pretty self-explanatory. Very satisfied with this item, it's sturdy, well put-together, and grates cheese!"
4,"Good, but worried","I have used mine for about a month and it is holding up good, but I am worried about the rubber at the bottom as I am unsure how long it will stay on."
3,Huge,I use this all the time to grate my own cheese after spending too money buying already shredded cheese-it is huge but you can shred a cup of cheese with 3-4 strokes which is great and it cleans up nicely
3,"Good grater, but hard to fully clean","Good grater, but hard to fully clean the bottom lip that is folded up. Anything that you grate gets stuck in the tiny area and is VERY hard to clean out..."
3,It works fine,"It is a bit larger overall than I realized.It is a grater. It grates. The side that is for slicing, slices."
3,Sturdy table,My kids are having a ball with this table.The paper rolls out smoothly and is well held in place by the bar at the end.The one disappointment is in ease of clean up. For a children's art table I would think the top would be easier to clean. It really stains easily.
4,Great for the collector!,"Nice hat. Not the highest quality, but still worth having. Minor grip--wish 2007 Series was on it. Price was great. Shipping and handling was prompt and fair."
3,Super Reader,"The Angel chronicles books are adapatations of Buffy tv series episodes. The episodes done here are Halloween, where Ethan Rayne's costume shop makes you become what your costume represents, and the two What's My Line episodes, where Kendra the Slayer comes to town, and Spike manages to get the du Lac magic going for Drusilla. Buffy also has to deal with the Order of Taraka wanting to remove her live status."
4,okay,"I think these chronicles are mainly good but i wish they would end happily, not Angel thinking this will never work"
4,"I liked it, I loved it, I want some more of it...","So far I've been pretty pleased with the Angel Chronicles; I haven't had the opportunity to see most of these episodes and this was a good way to get a total feel for the stories. The only problem is, they gave me such a clear picture (I could imagine these scenes while I read them) that now I want to SEE the episodes and I have no way of doing it! Please, please, let there be more volumes for Angel. You can't leave me hanging in mid season!"
5,the best one ever to date,"Excellent, absolutely brilliant. I'm a big Buffy fan and I've read most of Buffy books and this one is my favorite one ever. It features 3 of the most classical Buffy episodes. They couldn't have picked any episode better than these 3. They are funny and well-depicted. The thoughts of the characters are funny, awkward and adorable at the same time. This one is even better than the Angel Chronicles Vol. 1 coz Buffy and Angel's relationship has grown stronger and their love for each other is irresistable. You have to read it to love it. If you're a buffy fan, this one is a must, if you're not, get it anyway, you'll love it."
3,"Well, over all ok","I know some people won't agree with me on this, but I didn't think that the author did a very good job of capturing those certain episodes. Also, I already saw those episodes, so it held no suspense. However, since I love Angel and Buffy, it just gets three stars for that fact and that fact only. :) Anyway, I would suggest that if you haven't seen these episodes then you can buy this book, but it might be a slight waste of money if you have seen these episodes"
2,Buyers Be Warned,I bought this as a replacement radiator to an old set of speakers. What I was unaware of was that this item has a downward facing lip which adds to the size. To get this to fit I will have to carve about 1mm around the opening. Even then the radiator will be resting on this lip instead of flat against the case.On a side note; shipping cost half of the price of the item and came very slowly. Overall very disappointed with this product.
3,Good with the bad,"This was a creepy, disturbing book with an ultimately hopeful ending. It was much more analytical and philosophical than I expected, thinking it would be more of a traditional horror plot without a lot more. While some of the long speeches from Will's father got a little tedious, the main point -- that evil feeds on sadness and despair and can be vanquished by happiness, laughter and love -- was excellently woven into the plot. Will and his father are great characters, juxtaposed against Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger and even Jim, who has both light and dark in him."
5,By the pricking of my thumbs...,"Bradbury's novel opens up with a wonderful prologue describing good months and bad months. After reading this, I couldn't wait to delve into the novel to discover what other morsels of genius he had to offer.The story of good versus evil, youth versus death, and love versus hate is timeless. It will never get old. It will be recycled in various formats until the day people stop telling stories. Bradbury uses his story as a vehicle to expound upon these themes.When a wicked carnival comes to town it tempts its inhabitants with youth and life. It's hard to say no to your greatest wishes as Will, Jim, and Charles Halloway discover. Some townsfolk cannot turn their back on their dreams. Others discover that true happiness means accepting Life's twists and turns, no matter how cruel they may be.This novel is full of exquisite figurative language. Bradbury shows his prowess as a storyteller in this tale of good and evil."
5,"A different time, but still scary","With so many reviews there's not a lot to add, so I'll say this. If you like horror and haven't read Bradbury, read Something Wicked This Way Comes. The phrasing and language is very different from what you'll read in modern thrillers, but underneath the dark prose is a down to earth horrifying story that you won't forget.Poisoned Soil"
4,Really Good Read!!,"This is the story of Will and Jim, best friends for as long as they can remember. One night, a carnival comes to town. But something about this carnival is not quite right and the boys are determined to find out what.This is a fantastic story. It is about love and friendship, good versus evil. It is about our desires and our fears. It has wonderful descriptions, but the writing is a little difficult at times and interrupts the flow of the action. Were it not for that, this would be a five star book. Definitely a recommended read."
2,Overrated,"I have to admit that I just don't get it. I'm baffled as to why Ray Bradbury is considered such a genius. This book, considered one of his best, really doesn't stand out to me as anything all that special. The plot is cute, at best. It's not terribly creative; in fact, it's quite formulaic and often predictable. The characters are interesting, but not in any profound sort of way. And the writing is choppy and unrefined. I might give this book to an 11-year-old looking for a quick, easy read. But I have to believe that the past forty years have produced better material in the way of fantasy fiction."
1,Didn't like it,"I'm an avid reader, and I am usually able to comprehend what I'm reading. But this story was a bit too descriptive, I'm sure that appeals to some people, but not to me or any of the other kids in my english class. It seems to the majority of us that one would have to be on acid to understand what's going on, this may be because it's the end of the school year and we're seniors, but I think it's mainly due to the over-descriptive nature of the book."
3,Not bad for horror,"Something Wicked This Way Comes, not bad for a horror novel. im usually not into horror, but all in all it wasnt bad. the storyline was pretty original, and the writing itself was not bradbury's best, but still decent. The plot follows the escapades of two best friends, one being mischivious and curious, the other quiet and shy. Their simple life becomes greatly twisted, and I mean twisted, when a Halloween carnival arrives. An illustrated man, a blind fortune telling witch, and a dwarf are just the beginnings of trouble. oh, and there is the carousel that can change your age instantly."
3,Mrs. Pearson -- 2nd period,"The book 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is a book about two young boys trying to find adventure, only to realize the adventure coming to them is not what they were out looking for. I think that this book teaches a valuable lesson and when looking for adventure make sure you look up the road a little futher."
3,Something Wicked This Way Comes,Easy to see why so many other writers try to copy Bradbury's style of writing.But few can match it maybe King at his best comes close.Looking forward to reading the other Bradbury books i have brought.
4,Received incorrect book,"I received the wrong book, so I had to take the time to mail it back. I did receive the correct book finally."
2,Bradbury Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Surprised at what a dud this story felt like, after my other experiences with Bradbury...there is a movie version, and that is equally awful. Not at all what I was expecting."
2,Not very wicked.,"I bought this assuming to be enthralled by a 'dark carnival'; to be a bit frightened at the least, but I was more taken aback by the repetition of bradbury's wording. He uses words with like meanings in long strings and it got old rather quickly. Some parts are like reading entries in a Thesaurus; I skipped over these ""defining"" paragraphs/sentences after the first couple chapters.The book was not 'wicked'; it isn't even as scary as some R.L. Stine books I dug up recently and those aren't even a fraction of the size and depth this attempts. With the name ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"", I was expecting wickedness worded out; twisted thoughts and evilness dealt out by a ominous force. No deal. The book is rather tame - by its name I was expecting Steven King but instead got Walt Disney.It's a child's book. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Er!,I read this book for school and it was really confusing. Half the book didn't make sense. I dont suggest it because its real confusing. The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury is alot better. Because its easier to understand.
2,Couldn't get past page 30,"I tried to read this, but found Bradbury's style too distracting and confusing. There are some sentences you re-read for pleasure, thinking: 'Wow, well said!' But he doesn't reign in the mannered technique enough for you to relax and enjoy the story. It's a bad habit some authors have, akin to a playwrite walking out onstage during the middle of a performance to shout to the audience, ""Hey! I wrote this! Me! Ray Bradbury!""Obviously a talented writer, but not disciplined enough in how he uses that talent."
3,A Thrilling Book,Recently I Read the book Something Whicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. It is a very interesting book and requires some thinking to understand this book.It is about two boys Will and Jim. it was in the middle of October when a carnival comes to town. This is a very strange carnival. They take all the people that come to the carnivle and turn them into a part of their freak shows.I had a good experience reading this book it was very entertaining. It took me only about a week to read this book and itwas worth the time.
4,Classic Bradbury,"This is a great book...sadly, I just didn't like it as much as I did 30?? years ago...but that's me; not Bradbury. I've been reading a book of 100 of his best stories, and it reminded me how incredible a writer he is. I hate to say it, but I don't think there are many imaginations like his anymore....imagination is, I fear, a casualty of the push into cyber space....I also love that many of his short stories refer to other classic writers, like Edgar Allan Poe...and remind (me) to read them again."
2,Hmmm....,"Well, I got it in my mind that I wanted to read some Ray Bradbury and figured this was a good place to start, and now I'm not so sure. I have got some MAJOR gripes with this book. First off, being that there is absolutely nothing believable about Jim or Will. Not a single instance of these characters seeming real. Secondly, the way that Bradbury structures sentences in this book has to be some of the worst grammar I have ever seen in a publication, major or independent. The thing that really gets me about it is that this is pretty much an internationally love piece of fiction and I just can't see the justification of it. Even the actual story itself, which is wonderful in idea, is completely underwhelming because of the way Bradbury writes this novel. I still want to read Farenheit 451, I certainly hope it's much better written than this book is. Not to sure I can honestly give this book a recommendation to anyone."
1,Rich prose poetic in presentation...not to my liking..,"Maybe it is just that this book it's style, it's prose did not translate well for me here in the UK but I cannot understand the fascination with something I do not understand. It's a coming of age novel but the language is too rich and poetic for my liking "" They ran in urine smell of shadow, they ran in clean ice smell of moon. The calliope steam-throb whispered, tatted, trilled.""....""in flight, in heat-spell river of wind and blaze of metal, in jog of July and August horses whose hoofs thudded the air like thrown fruit, his eyes blazed""I thought Boy's Life by Robert McCammon truly inspiringly brilliant (in fact I find anything by McCammon brilliant) but Something Wicked This Way Comes for me had few redeeming features the richness of language made a truly boring experience and I struggled to finish...I admire those of you who found inspiration from Bradbury's words but sadly not me :(("
2,Not an unabridged recording,The most important thing to know about this cd set is that it is NOT an unabridged sound recording of the book. It is a performance like a play. Amazon's description is not clear.
1,"Terrible writing, silly story","Except for the first 5 or 10 pages, the book is a terrible read. Bradbury starts well but turns increasingly pretentious and obscure. From the third chapter on, there is at least two metaphors per paragraph, and quite a few of them are undecipherable."
2,It's OKAY,"There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:""Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.""Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me"
2,I was expecting horror.....,"Ray Bradbury is an exceptional writer....and this story is like a well-written Goosebumps book. It is NOT scary for an adult brought up on Stephen King horror. However, I was fooled by reviews claiming this book ""has been known to give some people nightmares"".... well, those ""some people"" are twelve year olds. I recommend this book for pre-teens. For adults, I recommend Stephen King's Needful Things, which is vaguely similar."
1,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read."
5,I thought it was a very well written book.,I think Ray Bradbury is a great writer. even though I do not usually enjoy science fiction I really enjoed Bradbury's style.
3,Worth your while.,"""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" was a book that was a lot of hype, and not enough material. The book was good, but reveiwers told me that it was scary, intresting, and kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. In reality, I found the book was not increadibly scary, only falling a few notches ahead of the series ""Goosebumps"" in terms of horror. Bradburys writing stye is quite different, and at a few points, almost hard to follow. ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" is a book made mainly of details, yet still depics many vague scenes. The paace of the book is very slow as you start out, and only real puts you on the edge of your seat in the last few chapters. I have fallen asleep while reading this book. The book in depth is shallow, yet the overal plot is an interesting one, and Bradury is an author every young reader should experience."
5,What a great book!,"When I began reading Something Wicked This Way Comes, it seemed uninteresting and childish, but as I continued on, I found myself unable to put it down. Not only has Ray Bradbury created a terrifying novel, but a deeply moving story about human nature. I loved the ending. I highly recommend this book to everyone!"
5,Woohoo this book was good!,hehehe...I was reading this book one day and I really enjoyed it by the time I was done with it. I was reading it for school and it introduced me into the world of Ray Bradbury. I would recommend this book to anyone looking into a quick but fun read. This book took me about 4 hours MAX. Its better than the Martian Chronicles but not as good as the illustrated man
2,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"I was really excited to receive this cd of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. But I found the sound erratic and the acting and dialog stiff. Way too bad, since I love this story."
2,This applies only to the error-ridden Kindle version,"The book is great, and the Kindle price is very low ($1.99 as I write this). However, the Kindle file is riddled with errors: typos, bad returns, sentences run together, no table of contents. There's nothing like reading a great book and having the experience marred by a terrible translation to a new medium. I would have happily paid more for a decent, readable version of the book."
2,It's OKAY,"There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said.

These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me"
2,"Too Cryptic to Be Understandable, Let Alone Scary","I don't get it. This book is supposed to be a classic of the horror genre. Just about everyone agrees on that point. The negative reviews stick out like sore thumbs. Well, here's another sore thumb. The premise is great. An evil carnival comes to town and preys on the emotional and spiritual weaknesses of the residents. The problem is that the story gets lost in the enigmatic writing style that Bradbury chose for this book. Half the time, I didn't really know what was going on. Maybe I'm missing something. If I am, I'm missing it by a mile."
2,book is better,"I first read this book when it came out in paperback, I was probably 13. It is still to this day one of my most favorite books. The movie. however, was a big dissappointment. I'm really excited about introducing the audiobook to my wife, who is not a big reader."
5,Perhaps one of my favorite books,I admit i thought this book seemed strange and somewhat corny from first reading the synopsis. But after begining to read i was imediately swept into Bradbury's vision. I could clearly see every detail and believe in the fantastic events. This book also provides a wonderful discourse on good and evil and the nature of each. As all good literature should it does not provide answers but asks deep questions.
2,"Interesting, but not his best...","I thought this book was a little off target, and kind of boring in some places. If you havn't read anything by Bradbury, you might want to try the Martian Chronicles or Farenheit 451 first."
3,"Wonderful story, terrible formatting","I'm really torn over this one. On the one hand, it's great to have this classic book in a Kindle edition. On the other, whoever proofread this should find another line of work.The font formatting (italics, etc) is completely absent. The paragraphs are almost all mashed together. For every ten paragraphs in the original, this version gives us maybe one.If you've read this book many times, you can, perhaps, get something out of this version if you remember the book well. (Of course, you may find this version as heartbreaking as I did.) If you've never read the book, this will be a hard slog, and without Bradbury's carefully chosen pacing, a lot is lost.The story is easily five stars. The formatting for this version is one. Hence, three stars. Three stars which weep in a black velver sky, while circus tents grow, like mushrooms, in the dark.I hate typing these next four words: skip the Kindle version."
5,What could be found wrong with this book?,"I had to write to say do NOT listen to the many reviews of this book describing it as empty, dated, lacking creativity, etc. If you're familiar with Bradbury at all, this book will live up to your expectations of his typical high quality of writing. If you are not familiar with Bradbury, I'd personally say start with something closer to F451, Martian Chronicles, or some short stories to get a feel for Bradbury, but regardless of when you read this book, you'll be impressed. Bradbury creates suspense throughout the book, in fact, the only reason I read this book so quickly was because I simply could not put it down! There's no way to describe the magic bradbury creates, please, do yourself a favor and read this and every other Bradbury story you can get your hands on!"
5,Greatsest mystery movie of all times,"Something wicked this way comes the movie is a mind puzzeling and an abnormal movie, because of the characters and the events that catch your eyes and mind.This story of two boys who encounter the sinister wonders of Cooger and Mr.Dark's pandemonium shadow show. They will soon discover the show's awful mystery a mystery that will change the life of every person it touches. THis movie is in my opinion one of the greatest mystery movies of all times and could capture your attenion with it's phenonaminal event's and in conclusion that is why I rate this movie 5 stars"
1,Not For Me...,So I don't really understand why this is considered a horror novel? I feel that it was made for children and Bradbury's writing style is a little confusing at times and kind of bland. I thought of it as more of an adventure story then anything. If you want something that is scary then this is not for you. I am a huge horror book nut but this book just didn't do it for me at all.
3,"Very entertaining, solid story...","I have taken two stars off my rating because I felt the ending was very rushed. I would have liked to know more about the Illustrated Man, aka Mr. Dark, who was the most fascinating character in the novel. Also, I don't know if I liked Mr. Bradbury's style of writing for this novel - there were sections where I couldn't follow the imagery and wasn't connecting to what he was talking about. Otherwise, a very enjoyable, fast paced, thriller/horror story from Mr. Bradbury."
3,Second best way of purchasing used books,"Been trying to find a copy of this book for a while (while not paying list price of course). How can you go wrong at $0.00 + shipping and handling. Only issue was that someone had highlighted the book in pink. The rating on the book was 4 stars. though the cover looked good, someone should have flipped through it. Only better solution would have been if I had visited the store myself. Since options for used books in my area are limited, this was the best choice."
3,There Is Magic Here,"I adore Ray Bradbury, but Something Wicked This Way Comes, though it carries magic, is, after all, not one of his best. It comes nowhere near comparing to Dandelion Wine or Leviathan '99 or Fahrenheit 451. It is more along the lines of Somewhere A Band Is Playing... not exactly mediocre, but not exactly executed properly. I loathe saying these things about a true master that is perhaps my greatest inspiration, but I have read enough of him to suggest that he has far better works than this book considered by many to be a classic."
5,Perhaps my favorite study bible,I deeply appreciate my Key Word Study Bible. The Greek and Hebrew lexicons at the rear are to me a wonderful help during my time of searching the Word. This is great Bible for someone with more than a cursory knowledge of the Bible who is not afraid to put some work into their Bible Study. LZ
2,A bit disappointing,"The more time I spend with this particular Bible, the more I'm disappointed with it. I have the KJV (2nd printing). There are numerous typographical errors throughout, and a few instances in which the editor changed words from the traditional KJV text, presumably to make it more ""readable.""What really turns me off to it, however, is the commentary. Often very good, it at times however, is just flat wrong, especially when dealing with the subject of election/predestination. Mr. Zodhiates is actually almost self-contradictory at points regarding this subject.Given all that, I must say that the concept is a good one; that is, of having the words indexed to a Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek Lexicon that is included in the back. There have been numerous times I've been able to consult the dictionary in the back, when I did not have the cumbersome Strong's Concordance with me. The only downside to this is that not every word is indexed."
5,Sore Throat help is here....,"Best product for a sore throat...and while the taste is just alright, the flavor is still a million times better than the disgusting cherry medicinal one....I'm expecting a medicine taste with the mint flavor, so it works out for my tastebuds. And it soothes and numbs a sore throat..."
4,Best Foot Forward,These songs are overlaid with complexity I wasn't expecting. Each song is so unique that the album could be confused for with an artist compilation. Are you thrashing? Are you bopping to the beat? Are you moping? All of the above? I was anticipating Supercoolnothing 3.0 but Fullblackhabit is a giant leap forward for a genre notably stuck in repeat.
4,He's back...finally!,"After making us wait almost 10 years, Eric Powell is back with a new album from 16volt! I have to admit that I only recently discovered this album even though it was released in 2007. It is an excellent follow-up to supercoolnothing, and I'm happy to say that 16volt has lost nothing during the hiatus. fullblackhabit contains the same guitar heavy, dense industrial music that we've come to expect from 16volt, but adding some of the melodic, atmospheric type of industrial that they played earlier in their career. If you are a 16volt fan already, buy this album! You will not be disappointed. Now let's hope that they don't make us wait another decade for another disc!"
5,Play Classical Guitar book,Very good resource for those of us of humble circumstances. Wish this was around when I was young.
2,A porno flick with a beat,"Folks, if you know what the crew are about, don't bother. These are essentially uncensored versions of their crude videos that appeared on ""Yo MTV Raps"" in the late 80s-early 90s. Pulchritude and raw sexism with a beat. The Japan section of the video referrs to a clip of a pornographic act on stage during a concert in Japan. Need I say more? There you have it."
4,Great Intro to Analogies,"As a speech pathologist in a public school, I love this book to introduce analogies in a fun enjoyable way. The only problem I have with it is one of the analogies is incorrect. One of the analogies was: Knight is to castle as small is to large. ??? That doesn't make sense to me. I changed that analogy and the next one so that it would rhyme: Knight is to castle as dragon is to moat. Road is to wagon as ocean is to boat. (Instead of barge)."
3,SORRY FELLAS,"Man, I hate to give a Joe Henderson acoustic quartet session only 3 stars but this one is a bit of a drag. After hearing RELAXIN' AT CAMARILLO also with Chick Corea on piano this one disappoints. It is down tempoed too much with waltz-like tunes and a ballad. Joe's Bolero seems a bit over latinized. Only on the last tune do we get a straight-up up-tempoed swinger. Maybe you can use this to cool off with after listening to JOE HENDERSON BIG BAND.--Hey,don't forget drummer Pete La Roca's Blue Note quartet session BASRA which could pass for a Joe Henderson quartet date. You must know about Joe's classic quartet date INNER URGE by now."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID MACHINE,"I have three package of this products and I have a studio apartment.I put all three of them in my small apartment.GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?AFTER 10-14DAYS?THE MOUSE CAME and it seemed that the Machines didn't work at all.I wish I could Return this.. since I bought it from one of the local hardware store.they wouldn't let me return.anyway it sucks don't buy it.my first time comments here in my life cuz I am so mad for this machineplus, it has 'tik tik....' annoying sounds when you plug in."
1,Yikes!,"We're here trying to find a replacement for this text because the daily messages frequently ask the reader to accept Jesus as their Savior. It just doesn't make sense. I thought this book was supposed to be for practicing Christians, not for trying to convert your kids. Not everyone is of the Born Again variety and really, what could kids at this age be doing that they need to confess their sins, repent and accept Jesus every week?"
4,Comprehensive but not perfect,"This is a good resource to prepare the following CCNA exams640-801 or 640-811 and 640-821.Although information is not 100% up-to-date and with some errors in the book, but good enough to get me pass CCNA in Jan 2005 in first try. I think these two books are very comprehensive, however if you need the latest information I guess you need to do some search in www.cisco.comFor Errata go to http://ciscopress.com/title/1587200953#I found out the NetSim LE is very useful which is free come with the CCNA libary package. The full version NetSim go to www.boson.com to find out more detail informationGood luck on CCNA"
3,"Cisco Certification Library, 6th Edition by Wendell Odom","This Book provides a lot of good information. The questions at the beginning and end of each chapter are also good. The NetSim software provided with the library is actually better than the test engine used during the actual INTRO exam. Having said that, relying on just this source to get thru the exam on the 1st try may not get you there. I took the INTRO exam on 3/7/05 and scored 815 with a minimum Pass of 825 required. This book tends to make you over confident. It is very good on a lot topics especially subnetting, but there were just too many questions that I got wrong. I am looking for another source of material before I try again sometime this year. This is an excellent source, but the questions in (at least the INTRO) give you a false sense of confidence. If you are expecting to see any of them again on the exam, you will be disappointed. I knew the information in the INTRO Book cold, but that was not enough."
3,SCAM ALERT,"I bought this ""library"" because the labeling on the box leads you to believe that you will get the full Boson NetSimm LE Router and Switch LAB simulator software. But you don't get that in the box.What you get is the Boson software that you install and then when you attempt to use it, it pops up and tells you that you must pay an extra approx $100 (or more) to get the ""activation code"" for the router and switch labs.However, the in-box test engines that come on the CD's DO include some good simulations.And the PDFs and flash cards are good. So I still recommend it."
3,Error! Error! Does Not Activate!!!,"When trying to install the CD-ROMs that come with these two books, I was told the serial numbers were invalid. Then when trying to use the web activation method all I got was an 'invalid parameter'message. Boson expects you to pay for a toll call to activate your disks!!! When finally activated there were so many errors in the questions and simulations that it wasn't an effective teaching tool. The books overall are good to learn from - the CD-ROMs from Boson aren't worth the price (free)."
2,There are better CCNA books out there.,"I have to start by saying that just because you are a CCIE certainly doesn't make you a good writer. And that is what you will find here in the Cisco Press CCNA books by Odom. I find the writing rudimentary at best and Odoms command of real world analogies could use some work.The questions for each chapter are not only poorly written to begin with, but there lacks any explanation in the answers section as to why a particular answer is right and why one is wrong. This is key to learning the material, you need to know why you got something wrong, not just that it *is* wrong. I might recommend this book if you are re-certifying and already know the material, but if you are a first timer, beware. You will find Odoms style of writing to be somewhat confusing and at times completely unhelpful."
2,WARNING!,"I have not yet read this book, as it just arrived a few moments ago, but I ordered it on the basis of a past reading of Ouspensky's, In Search Of The Miraculous. Imagine my surprise and disappointment, if you will, to discover that this is not the whole book, but a reprint of an extract of Chapter 10, commencing at page 390 of the original text.No doubt, I will probably enjoy this $14.00, one chapter snippet of Ouspensky's work, but there really should be a disclaimer added to the Amazon text to be viewed by prospective purchasers. You ARE NOT getting the entire book, just chapter 10.I rated this book 2 stars on the basis of deceptive advertising and not as a critique of Ouspensky's thinking."
5,A book for anyone interested in thought.,"Ouspensky writes most elloquently of a fundamental principle of thought. He points out the universality of all of mans work to understand the incomprehensible and in a most objective manner. This demonstrates the other important point he makes; that there is no place in a honest mind for the preconceptions and misinformation our generic society has imposed upon us. All in all, a great read, it you are willing to put forth the effort to think about it. If not, pass it by."
1,A New Model of the Universe (yellow cover),It is vital that you mention that it is only one chapter of the complete book by Ouspensky under the title A New Model of the Universe.
5,Excellent Book,This book makes it easy to understand difficult topics in Ruby. I loved the way the authors gradually built up from a simple example and illustrated the complicated concepts. Reminds me of my favorite Electronics teacher in college.Beginners must read this book.
4,Probably great if you have time,"I can't say a lot of good or bad about the book because I didn't get past the lesson where you program a ""conversation"" with an old lady. So far, I haven't had good luck learning Ruby or VBA from books or other written materials. If you have the time to spend working through this book, you might want to consider taking classes at a local college. I probably won't buy any more books about programming in general. The format and tone of the book seems very good, so if you've got 21 days with enough time to walk through the whole book, I would say go for it."
3,Too Dry For Me,"This book was too dry for me. In fact, I didn't finish it. I like to open a book and look at the code examples before I buy it but, in this case, I bought it online. It seemed to me that the examples weren't very interesting and had a great deal of math in them. When I pick up a book of this type, if a lot of the examples include math examples, I don't purchase it. I am one of those people that is horrible in math and I usually don't get the examples.Since I did not read through the entire book, I will give it 3 stars since I just don't know what is in it (besides math). I went withProgramming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide, Second Editionversion.Again, don't take this to heart that one book is better than another. There might have been very valuable information that I missed but, when I want examples, I want real world examples that I can wrap my head around."
1,Just okay,I was disapointed in this book. Although the book was in good shape and fast delivery. It was the content that was lacking. Which is the chance you take when you order a book without looking inside to see first.
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this product because I was informed that it was good for minor skin irritations and lesions. I was looking for a product my son brought back from England many years ago called Shen Yang that had an awful smell. I can't find it anymore. It helped control the minor skin infections I get on my back because of a mild immune deficiency. I thought this cream helped b/c it had a mild medicinal smell. A soak in a hyper-salinic salt bath solution for 15 minutes works much better. You make this by pouring table salt, rock salt, kosher salt or ice cream salt into the tub until no more can go into solution. There will be salt grains in the bottom of the tub. You probably need at least 1&1/2 lbs. of salt so buy cheap salt in big quantities. A normal thick emollient cream from the drugstore without a medicinal smell worked better to keep the itching down. Also an over the counter steroid cream would work. I was trying to do without the steroid."
1,Waste of Money !,"I should have listened to the Bad Reviews of this Book, and not wasted my money.It goes into no depth in explaining how you actually achieve the globalised business that magically creates indefinite cash flow and passive income.The so called case studies that illustrate the concepts are again totally lacking in detail.The Book does not give you anything more fundamental than this vague concept of the ""Agile Business Structure"".Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time and money on this Book as I did."
5,Kinda different strategy,"Here's the premise. You can build a business and compete in the global market and beat out brand name products. You can do this from your home and if you do it well, you can build a cashflow generating strategy to allow you to 'Stop Working'.I like the book because the strategy is a bit different. If you read Rich Dad Poor Dad you'll appreciate the Cash flow 'B' and 'I' type focus of the book. It goes beyond Rich Dad because it actually tells you how to do what it claims that you can do.I liked the strategy most of all because I really hate my job and am trying to figure a way out. The idea of selling to a global market is a bit overwhelming but a pretty logical case of presented (using other businesses distibution network).I'm looking at other options, including real estate (somewhat expensive though), but this is one of the best financial strategies I've come across so far that seems practical, logical and do-able."
2,MISSED THE MARK,GOOD TITLE BUT LITTLE IN CONTENT. PROVIDED NO REAL INSIGHTS ON HOW TO HELP ONE BUILD AN EXIT STRATEGY IN STOPPING WORK. SOME POINTS OF REMINDER BUT NOT MUCH FOR A BOOK. COULD HAVE PUT THE LITTLE INFO OFFERED IN 3 PAGES.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
4,"Great, But Could Be More Comprehensive","The entries in this dictionary are great and informative, but it just seems like it could have had even more in it (plus, there are a few entries that probably didn't need to be in there such as Karl Popper, a great philosopher of science and all, but how much does he really affect critical theory?). Still, the smaller size does make it even more portable, which is kind of a plus, and for the amount of information that is in here it's totally worth the price."
3,"Decisions, Decisions...","In this day and age, when the serial-killer idea (in books / movies / TV shows / websites / news headlines) has permeated our culture, a film about one of these odious creatures had better be A) unique, and / or B) extraordinarily well-done. CHOOSE is neither. While it does have good points, like the dripping hourglass and the whole ""bad vs. worse choice"" scenario, I still found myself feeling as though I'd seen it all before, in far superior films. Also, the story seemed rushed, w/ characters finding clues at light-speed, and making huge, unfounded leaps in logic. If you love movies about vengeful psycho / sociopaths, then you might enjoy this one. Just don't expect anything ground-breaking..."
2,Choose.......another movie,This is girlfriend\wife horror. 'Choose' plays nicely with limited blood and deprivation. So if you have to get it cause you want a horror you will do ok. It is really limited by its own boundries but overall not very good and you have probably seen it before (and better).
2,Good for kids only,"Bought this so-called boombox and after a few months it would not play MP3 CD's or even regular store-bought audio CD's. When I insert a CD the display says ""no"".Sound quality is average and the bass boost - well you might need extra sensitive hearing to tell the difference.Only thing that works on this set is the USB flash drive player and the radio.Could do with a clock.Set only shows the number of the song being played. No tags.Don't waste your money buying this !!!!"
3,first one dead,not a bad box for the price but no were the sound quality of my old AWIA 926 but also no were the price either.But sadly the first one would not read mp3 cds so I returned it and amazon proved once again to be a great companyas they automaticly picked up the reurn ship cost with out questionand now waiting for the replacment
4,I think JWin may be reading my mind ...,"... because I've been wanting a boombox with a radio that can play mp3 CD-Rs & CD-RWs, SD cards and hook up to my mp3 player. The sound is as you would expect from a product at this price.The only things I would tweak is to make the display show artist, song and album titles. Currently, it only shows the track number. And, how about an alarm clock?So JWin, I'm sending telepathic messages to you ..."
1,This device sux,I got one of these awhile back and been having trouble ever since. More then 80% of the time it won't read my CD or a CD with mp3's on it. So as a last resort I put in a usb flash drive. Well it reads the small drive like a 256 mega bytes but it can't read my 2 gig flash drive. I bought this machine for work so I wanted a long playing device but forget it. I hate it.
1,Very disappointing product,I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this product. The sound from the speakers was of very poor quality and I returned the product to Amazon. I am however very much pleased with the way the return was handled by Amazon. Very professional and quite satisfying.
1,Skips on most CD's,"We ordered this item excited about its ability to play MP3 and standard CD's. Right out of the box it skipped on the first CD we played, but we were able to get it to play fine if we carefully inserted the CD. Now, two months later every CD skips and we are frustrated since we can't return it. We don't know if this is a fault of every unit, but it was our frustrating experience and suggests there may be a quality control problem."
4,Helped me be a better boss,"These tools are great. I had used the KnowledgePoint policy writing software years ago. Wrote an entire personnel policy handbook in an afternoon. And I knew nothing about HR or employment law!So when I started a new company I looked for the latest version, I saw that they had bundled it into the Ultimate Employer suite. Now I have started writing job descriptions for my (4) employees and I plan to evaluate them using Performance Now. It's a great value and time saver.These tools have helped me create a better work environment and, as we grow, it'll be easy to add new employees and make sure we're all moving in the right direction.Five stars on quality of output, value and ease of use. Minus one star because the individual programs aren't fully integrated."
2,"Nice, but not Chekhov","This translation is a nice effort -- at rewriting the original, extremely subtle text as a modern English drama according to the tastes and limitations of the translator. If you're looking to capture the true genius of Chekhov, try another."
3,Step into the deep end!,"Dixon's book, while exploring aspects of Organisational Communication in a competent manner, fails to hold the attention of the ""lower-academic"" reader, also known as Undergraduates or even those below the Doctorate level. It employs bombastic words and sentence structure is wa too long for normal comprehension. I know that this book is adopted as a text in some University classes and would sympathise with those students not only having to grasp the ideas behind the book but to understand the form of language used in the book itself. Finally, while sufficiently researched and credible, it lacks readeability"
2,14 year-old reviewer,"Polland, while delving nicely into the setting and background of ninth century Viking Age, lost me entirely with the child-like dialogue and weak story-line. Much of her writing was un-realistic and therefore highly un-appreciated. Her writing definately needs to be brushed up several notches. While she develops her characters personalties nicely enough she then twists them around in odd ways that make the book rather undesirable. The book was rather boring all in all, I would not recommend it for an enjoyable read. If your having your child read this book for school and learning, fine then, It does indeed have valuable information concerning ninth century background, but if you want a nice book to enjoy, this is not the one for you!"
4,A Good Starting Point,"If you're interested in Norse or ""Viking"" myths, this book is a good place to start. It was written for the mid-elementary audience, but the writing is serious and straightforward. Adults can read it quickly and get a decent overview of these great stories without feeling burdened by a ""children's book"" atmosphere. For children, there are some very good picture books out there, but this book creates a much fuller literary experience. Its major shortcoming is the omission of the story of the Brising Necklace, which many parents in our culture might hesitate to read to their kids, anyway. Unfortunately out-of-print, this book can still be found used from several sources, usually as discards from school libraries.If this is less than you're looking for, the next step is the Crossley-Holland ""Norse Myths"" book."
3,Georgia on My Mind,"When I was married and living in Georgia, my wife bought this CD, and when she became my ex-wife, I moved to Ohio and left it with her. I miss it, and now I'm buying it, because it's got some really neat stuff on here -- without buying every single CD in the set (for example, my ex thought the Chick Corea cut, ""Captain Marvel"" was really cool, then bought more of his stuff and didn't like it (no accounting for taste)). As a music teacher, this is a handy CD to have around because it has a bunch of different styles on one disc; from Satchmo to Fusion and back. Enjoy."
2,Horrible,"Difficult to read, minimum of information, and no sample usage. Only an english definition and a kana pronounciation to go with each word. This is my least favorite Kanji dictionary.Instead, check out the Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary (ISBN 4-7700-2855-5) which is easy to read, with great explanations, wonderful lookup systems, and demonstrates the kanji as used in REAL words. Each kanji has meaning, but are rarely used by themselves in Japanese. Instead, this dictionary gives you a handful of words in which each kanji appears, a definition, and an example sentence or phrase."
2,Missing Several Kanji,"This is a very well designed layout and dictionary. It has a lot of kanji too, but the only problem is it is missing a few."
4,pretty good,"i just got this for christmas, and i like it; the only gripe i have is it doesn't have the readings of the characters: just the compounds it can fit into. but aside from that, VERY cool: gives the stroke #, all the common/some uncommon compounds, stroke order, and all 1945 kanji, so it's good by me ^_^"
2,There are better options,"While this is not a terrible dictionary, it has two major flaws:First, for each kanji it only lists compounds that begin with the given kanji. If the kanji happens to be an affix (attached to the ends of words), then no compounds will be listed.Second, it does not give all the connotations that a single kanji will have. Why is the kanji for 'north' used in the word for 'defeat'? This dictionary won't tell you.For these reasons I would recommend insteadThe Kodansha Kanji Learner's DictionaryIt uses romaji instead of kana, but don't let that deter you; you'll get plenty of practice reading kana outside of your kanji dictionary. It's learning kanji that's the hard part."
5,Hilarious,"This show can only be described as hilarious. The main character is supposed to be a jerk. But that's what makes him funny. He thinks the world is his fun place. He says the most outrageous things. And Little Spock (Jacob Kogan) is cool too, he plays Jon's son. Even people in North Ska-kota will like it!"
1,Wrong Item,I ordered this lamp... I guess the seller didnt have it because he sent me a lighting system that I need to install into a wall. Not cool... will be contacting amazon
4,Great resource for Endo,"This is a great resource for people who are wanting more information about endometriosis. If you have done a lot of research online, there are going to be a lot of things that you have already read, but you should still finds some things that are new information. The author decided to write a book because she was going through so much as most of us do when we are starting out struggling with endo. Great tool."
3,Good but not a must have.,"This would have been better just borrowed from the library. This book is not an essential for your endometriosis library. Worth a read, but nothing that I have consulted again."
1,a stinker,"This book is a stinker. Here's the deal...think of some catchy metaphor (e.g., life is a climb, life is a portrait, life is a ladder...something like that). Come up with a ""theory"" around the metaphor (e.g., you can climb or camp when you have a problem, you can copy a picture or create your own, etc.) Do a chapter on each idea (Chapter #1: Climbing, Chapter #2; Camping, etc.). Get friends and family members to ""review"" the book (favorably of course). If you have success, consider spinoffs like climbing at work, climbing at home, etc. Voila! You're an author and an expert! Now, hit the trail as a motivational speaker.This pretty much explains this one! Save your money and come up with your own book.Heh, maybe YOU can be an author and a motivational speaker!"
1,Trite and Simplistic,Mr. Stoltz has invented an acronym for the obvious: people with a good attitude get ahead in life. This is a gimmick disguised as a book.
1,a nice gimmick---not a very good book,This is yet another gimmicky kind of book disguised as science. I can save everyone allot of time and describe what's really in here---think in a positive way and some good things will happen to you---at least some of the time. The pseudoscience in here is a joke really.
1,Cartoonish,"We had an AQ seminar at work. It is the dumbest thing I have ever had to sit through.It's so cartoonish; filled with bland, useless metaphors that mean whatever you want them to mean.Life is a Mountain(tm)! Are you a Climber(tm)? a Camper or a Quitter?Climbers(tm) enjoy the highest highs! Campers ""play it safe."" Quitters avoid commitment. boo! Don't be a quitter! Be a Climber(tm)!Remember that 30 Rock episode where Liz Lemon had that ""Deal Breaker"" book?These clowns literally have trademarked the phrase ""Deal Breaker.""I would like to trademark the phrase Facile Joke(tm) for my reviews of anything produced by Stoltz."
3,Worth a look,"Some of this book is very simplistic if you have taken any psychology. The writing can be repetitive. That said, the assessment test is good, and the explanations of the different components of AQ are useful. I particularly liked the author's explanation of what it means to take ownership in a situation. The LEAD sequence is well explained and easy to use. In short, there are some useful tips and techniques here, particularly for those who work in human services, but the book is overlong given the simplicity of the author's message."
3,good gtranslation but avoid Ashman's idiocy,"The ENO Guides are well known for their superb translations and, in most cases, the articlea about the opera. This in an exception. Mike Ashman's article is nonsense and is best ignored. He goes out of his way to ""prove"" that PARSIFAL isn not a Christian opera bu citing that some aspects are cited in ""other religions"". Since when did Ashman become an expert on religion (or anything else for that matter aside from in his own mind)? Maybe he doesn't believe in Wagner's statements but his diatribe is unworthy of this series and is a wonder someone was stupid enough to include it. I own the series and this is one that I can urge buyers to avoid until some edition with intelligence prevails and omits Ashman's nonsense."
3,Classic,"Came on time as pictured! Son loves Trains, this is his secound other than the new style set up with 2 hooked together"
4,Cool Album!,"A great album, with some great solos by both artists. The interplay between Smith and Montgomery is beautiful, and they produce some elegant versions of familiar tunes. Not quite as 'rockin' as their first outing together, 'The Dynamic Duo', which has some great accompaniment. If you like either of these artists, or just like smooth guitar licks and the jazz organ sound, then you'll love this album."
4,"About ""This CD is SMOKIN' live.""","That reviewer is talking about Jimmy Smith ""Root Down"", this is a studio Album, it is much more mellow than the Dynamic Duo. Easy and smooth."
5,This CD is SMOKIN' live.,"This live recording in a small club is SO INCREDIBLE. It really smokes and is definitely one of the hottest Jimmy Smith recordings available. I have 30 or so titles by Jimmy Smith and have seen him a few times. This is one of my favorites, although there are very few I am not crazy for. The thing about this one is that it starts out without the crowd paying much attention because it is obviously very late and there is alot of loud talking and laughter in the room (this is from the LP version, I think the CD version has alot of the crowd filtered out), but when they get smokin' around the second song, the VERY LOUD crowd is like, DEAD SILENT and in awe. This recording really makes me shiver every time I listen to it."
2,WHERE ARE THE INTROS?,"This movie has 8 episodes, and all of which are great classics that make this DVD worth purchasing. HOWEVER, there are many flaws with the DVD itself. The most irratating thing is that the introduction and ending to each episode has been cut. You won't get to see the part where it says ""The End"" and plays the music. It just isn't there. Also, it is rather inconvienient that the episodes are out of order on the DVD. The case lists them one way, and they are featured another. Don't get me wrong, these episodes are great, but try to find them on another DVD."
5,The stronger recording,"While I do enjoy the original broadway recording of this musical, this version is so beautiful that it is hard to see any better."
1,Extremely weak recording.,"It sounds like it was recorded in a box car. It's one thing to dial back the orchestration, it's another to score it for a junior high show choir.I hope Evans and Russell got better together as they did more and more performances because there's certainly no connection here.I didn't have an issue with the accents in the 1st act (The London cast recording of Into the Woods is equal to the original Broadway cast) but even with American accents in the 2nd act the words are supposed to rhyme.I'm glad to support the revival of anything by Sondheim by buying the CD, but this is really terrible."
3,"Nice Revival, But No Comparison To Original","The London revival of ""Sunday In The Park With George"" is good, but does not match the excellence of 1984's original Broadway production and its stellar cast, led by Bernadette Peters & Mandy Patinkin.Best Tracks:Finishing The Hat (though will always belong to Mr. Patinkin)SundayChildren And ArtMove OnStill, a nice effort."
4,Entirely unlistened to...,"Having only seen the show live and never heard the recording of the cast, I can only advise anyone thinking of spending money on this album to consider spending a few more pennies and hearing the experience live. Sondheim is an auteur I have never spent time listening to. I had always associated him with ""what is not to like?"" New York, an entity that has pervaded a great deal of modern culture. But reducing him to those kinds of parallels is to miss the sheer beauty of the man's gift for enlightened beauty. And therein lies the greatness of Manhatten before the turn of the last century. Boy did they have it good. Shame someone had to come along and make a right mess...there is beauty here. Enjoy it."
5,Just as advertised,As the other reviewer noted this valve switches inlet lines with a ninety degree turn. The only way I would have known that was from the other review I read. The only one I could find on the market that did not require a 180 throw. Since that is exactly what I wanted I am well pleased. It appears to be well made. Of course you have to make sure you have the proper lines hooked to the proper ports so if replacing one which turns 180 degrees you have to be careful.
3,It was good with all the torture stuff!,"Well, what can I say. It was good. Good use of torture weapons. Guy from Millenium was kinda gay in the movie. He was the bald dude. It was cool when they were burning the witch. It was also cool when the bald dude fell in the PIT OF SPIKESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!! Im ok really. Anyway the movie was good.This is worth renting only once. Oh yeah there was a rat that got cut in half. It ruled. Party on. This has been another review by Fly 4 White Guy and The Godfather Corporation. Thank You."
3,"Slow, but functional","This is a good way to store image when you are going to shoot a lot of gb on vacations, travel, etc, but it's not very portable.- If you need to back-up your CF card, you need to have it plugged into the wall or the batteries will die out (I have an 8gb card; it took about 1.25 hours to upload the whole card to the Coolwalker).- It's very slow when viewing images.If you have the money to spend, I'd recommend getting something with a larger viewing area, such as the Epson multi-media products. I don't own any of them, but I've seen them used and they are much nicer and easier to view the images on."
2,Quite an exxagerated tale,"Throughout the book, Sonny talks about one of the Oakland Chapters members, who he referrs to as Cincinatti. Now, whether this person is himself or not, I think that this person has imbibed in way too many foreign substances. There's multiple stories of running around and talking to ghosts, taking ghosts for rides on their motorcycles, then hooking the ghost up with ol' ladies in the ghost world, etc. There were other typical Sonny Barger hidden slams about other clubs selling their old ladies in houses of ill repute, when in reality, it's much more believable were it to have been a confession. Either way, I really like the quote from Freewheelin Frank in his own book (a 60's paperback, now out of print) where he Quotes Sonny as saying: ""When I make money from the patches on my back, I will no longer be a Hell's Angel"". Bravo. And to think, ghosts riding on your motorcycle, eh?"
1,Disappointed,"Was expecting to read something interesting about the self-proclaimed ""legend,"" but it was a collection of stories whose truth was always questioned, EVEN BY THE BOOK ITSELF. The foreword warned that not all the stories were true. Then, after a more-interesting story, the next story sharted with ""Now this story is true, I swear it..."" Lame.There are much more interesting motorcycle stories (and better writing) on the 'Net. This book was filled with swear words thrown in the oddest places, there was no flow between the stories, the characters were confusing, maybe they needed the money and hurried the book to market, I dunno.The Zimmermans' first book on Sonny was much better, in spite of Sonny coming across as narcissistic as he did."
2,Not very good,"I agree 100% with the review questioning whether Sonny ran out of material; sure looks that way. The major problem with the book is that, except for a few very good passages (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one) it is just not interesting (then again, I almost dropped it back to 1 after reading one completely disgusting story about a biker's first success with the girl of his dreams; did they really have to include this?).In his ongoing attempt to clean up the biker 1%er image, portraying them as basically good guys who raise a little hell once in a while rather than real outlaws, Barger is forced to abandon what I'm sure would be infinitely more interesting stories. Overall really not worth the time or money."
2,"Adequate, but barely.","Although this book was entertaining, it is hardly the best book out there for tales of 'cyclers. I did enjoy the tale of the poor girl who got [...] on a Panhead that was trash. And the story about the guy who picked up a ghost was entertaining, even if it was hardly believable. Many of the stories were just too short and seemed to have no point. I point here in example the story about the kid who saw a bunch of 'cyclers going to a funeral. Big whoop. Keeping to stories of adventure would have been better, but many of these stories do't even fit the subtitle ""Hell-Raising"". Blaah."
2,Riding High Livin' Free by Ralph Sonny Barger Amazon Kindle Version.,"Found the chosen story lines disappointing. The booked lacked reader appeal for me, hence I was not compelled to return tothe book after several chapters had been read."
3,Making some money off of his name,"So its a work of fiction, mostly. Some of MY motorcycle stories are better... At least he is makin money legit. The paper quality is as cheap as one can make and still call it a book. More a collection of short stories, most don't even involve ""Sonny"". Can't find a reason to rate it better but (if you are into motorcycle fiction) can't really rate it worse."
3,Hmmmmmm?,"Do you have a short attention span? This book is for you. Quick and to the point. I've found Sonny to be a pretty good author considering his upbringing and where he's been. These are quick, short, stories some true some not! But has some merit."
2,this movie ok,this movie had to many twist and turns and hard to fallow alot of the time you was wondering what is going on
1,How dumb can you get?,"This movie sucks beyond belief. Don't waste your money.You have no idea what's going on until the end of the movie... when you do find out what's going on, it's so dumb and pointless, you'll want to get back the hour and a half you just wasted."
2,An Enemy of the People,"There are two versions of this play by Henrik Ibsen on film in English. One made in 1977 with Steve McQueen un the starring role of Dr. Stockman, and a 1990 made for TV version, produced for PBS on an adaptation by Arthur Miller and with John Glover in the role of Dr. Stockman. The 1977 version with Steve McQueen is far superior. In the 1990 version John Glover is much too hyper. He is often just plain silly--or even stupid--and he does not make standing up for truth appear very noble. Actually, this film nullifies the entire intent of the play as written by Ibsen in that it discredits the whole idea of standing up for truth and right.Steve McQueen's performance is sensitive to Ibsen's original intent, a very fine piece of work.I would strongly recommend that anyone considering purchase of this film insist on getting the 1997 Steve McQueen version.I would have to struggle to give the John Glover version two stars. For Steve McQueen I would happily assign five."
2,Terrible in Comparison,"After seeing this, it is criminal that the far superior Steve McQueen film version is not available on VHS of DVD."
1,Too Bulky!,"When I put this on my car visor, it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic! Having 30 CDs hanging over my head is just not a good idea. I tried to give it to my husband, but he thought the same thing, and got a smaller one that holds 10 CDs. Much better."
5,Great book for your animal lover!,We bought this for our 7 yr old daughter... she loves animals and had wanted to be a Vet since she was 3. She loves this book and has read it many times!
2,Very tedious,This is probably the single most tedious textbook I have ever read. I learned more from spending ~10 hours in SQL server 2008 and w3schools messing around than I did from reading this book.
1,Keep the receipt,"I own many database books from Access 98 to SQL server 2005... this is the worst DB book that I've used to date. It reads more like a book for researchers focusing on impractical theory rather than practical application. If you're writing your doctorate on databases this might be your book. If you want to learn about databases there are many, many better options."
1,Does this guy work for Microsoft?,"The author of this book seems to think the sun rises and set in Redmond, even contending that Microsoft is solely responsible for the success of ODBC. Yes 90% of the world's desktops have some version of MS Windows, but databases run on servers, not desktops. The complete neglect of non Microsoft products make this book incomplete at best, and present a very skewed view of the database world."
2,Waste of money,"Ridiculously overpriced, even for a textbook. There are actual mistakes littered throughout the book and the accompanying slides that were provided to the professor. The occasional error is understandable in a first edition, but by the 9th edition it's inexcusable.Yes, I am talking about the 9th edition rather than the 10th. Somehow after all these editions I don't think they've gone through and cleaned it up with the latest one.Maybe you think I'm just bitter because a new edition came out just in time for me to not be able to sell my 9th ed. back to the bookstore. Well, I won't deny that. But I will say that this is the first computer science textbook that I even tried to sell back."
2,General OK but,"The book was sold to me as ""NEW"" and it had writing in the book.The writing was in pen and hence this book is clearly NOT a new book."
4,Good but lacks proper layout,"This is really not a critique of the material in the text since I consider it adequate as a beginners guide to database concepts. Due to my limited experience with database texts I cannot comment more on the actual material, but having read many other technical texts, I can say that the material and the examples provided are laid out poorly. The text will explain a concept, but if you are truly new to this subject, you will find yourself repeatedly flipping back and forth by a few pages to the examples and diagrams that they refer to. Correct this problem for the next edition and all's well."
2,Not polished or put together very well,I had to buy this book for a Masters degree course. I think a fair amount of data is contained within the text but the organization style is not that good. The author drops hints that he has been writing this book for a long time and that it has helped some major names in the database world find inspiration... that's all well and good but a good book does this not make.The price is obviously way too much for something that is not really a practical guide. Most of the people that buy it will likely only be buying it because they are forced to. What a shame...it would be much nicer to have a quality product to learn from. This is not it in my opinion. It could be done better.
1,"Database Processing: Fundamentals, Design and Implementation","This has got to be the worst book that I have ever read. The author tends to confuse you. I considered myself to be very knowledgable when it comes to databases however, after reading this book I'm more confused than ever. I found myself reading some of the chapters two-three times just to try and understand what the author was attempting to say. It is definitely not a book for beginners."
2,Kathy should stick to step and hi lo aerobics,"Kathy has been around a long time and is a very good instructor but, in this DVD much of Kathy's form is incorrect. She needs to get a true Kettlebell training certification. Kettlebell form is extremely important. The weight is being thrown around using much momentum and core. This is a power workout not an aerobic class."
4,Just like dark chocolate or Asti Spumante!,"Every now and again I like to have a couple of squares of really good dark chocolate or a split of Asti Spumante. Some women like to go shopping for a new scarf or a purse. I guess it is just one of those ""chick"" things. Sometimes, I like to curl up with a good romance.A good romance to me is one where I can become emotionally invested with the characters. It isn't about erotica but some sexual tension is always good.Taking Love in Strideis the perfect little treat I was looking for. I look forward to reading more from Donna Fasano. Now I just need to go out and get some chocolate and Asti."
5,Fun and Lots of Spunk!!!,I received this book free in a drawing. I normally read dystopian or paranormal YA books. I am definitely happy to be introduced to this story and author. I will love to read her other books. Donna Fasano did a superb job at creating two characters with spunk and heart! I highly recommend this book to all. I can definitely add Ms. Fasano's name to my list of authors to keep up with when it is time to read another good book!
5,Wonderful story,I have read other books by Donna Clayton and enjoyed them thoroughly. I'm happy to say that this one is no exception in the enjoyment department! It's a great read. I highly recommend it.
5,A crackling contemporary romance,"Hah! Val2's review opens the way I was going to open mine: ""The cover says it all."" I love good contemporary romance, and boy, do I wish there were more books like this one out there. Taking Love in Stride is fresh, sexy fun. Andrea is a jock who brooks no nonsense, but is still entirely feminine and attractive--no mean feat. And Ian is... ::sigh:: Well, read it and see. Highly recommended!"
2,"Predictable, simplistic and boring","I found this book to be so predictable, the story line was too simple...there was no depth to the story or to the characters....and I had a hard time sticking with it. The whole story focuses on this woman's issues with her own father that she then transfers to the father of her student. How do they fall in love? I haven't a clue because there was absolutely no story there to give that scenario any meat or background. I'm just saying.....I see the author has other books...I hope they are better for the sake of those who buy them."
3,"Quick, fun read!","I did enjoy this, and it was some of what I expected. I'm still rather shocked that Ian did not go completely nuclear! Also, Denise and Harry played a nice role within the romance, too."
1,hard to follow,"I don't care for the author's abuse of the time line. Duras' character development is firm, but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing. Duras' message of using the women's body as a form of control and yet making the main character seem separated from her body doesn't seem to really say anything."
4,A gripping and sympathetic story with question in morality.,"Set in more than half a century before. It's arduous to understand the situation for that time being. But through the describtion of Marguerite Duras, I do feel the contradictory circumstances for a white girl in a place with entirely different cultures from her home country. Being tied with poverty, living in a strange countries, and having only one trustworthy friend are already painful enough. Worse still, she's receive no true love from her family, but violence. Though it may sound fruitless, jarring or even disgusting for her to be with the Chinese guy, it seems to be forgivable. It's a good book showing how one may be influenced alongside with the political, social as well as family situations and backgrounds."
2,"Excellent writing, poor plot.","I absolutely loved the style of Duras prose. It is top of the line, even translated. The plot however leaves much to be desired. Duras plays with events non-chronologically, telling you things early on which would best be saved for the end of the novel. If you're looking for something different, this book might be for you. If not, leave it alone. You'll be glad you did."
5,Outstanding Study Guide,"Howard Rosenthal really covers the territory well. If you read this book from cover to cover you should pass your tests. It is a good read, well written, and comprehensive. I highly recommend it for comps or NCE."
5,Amazing,This is an amazing book to review for the NCE exam. I loved the fact that it had explanations for the wrong and right answer and it was set in a way that you were forced (in a good way) to review all of the material until you got it. It is easy to read and understand. Much better with theories than your regular theories book.
2,Not a good source for the NCE,"I only studied with this book, and I passed, but I don't really attribute it to this study guide. Perhaps it was the version of the test I took, but out of the 200 questions, maybe 30 were covered in this study guide. This guide is chock full of names that you don't need to know (for the test) and it covers none of the DSM. The career section and the appraisal and research sections are not enough to be prepared for what's on the NCE. The other sections were fine though."""
4,Helpful. I passed the Exam...,"I passed the counselor's exam by studying primarily the information in this book. Of course, you will need to refer back to some of your school books but this is a very helpful book."
4,A Strong Resource,"I graduated in 1996, and I have been practicing as a mental health pratitioner for three years. I located this book on-line and read the reviews which prompted me to order it. The book is a great primary souce, but it is imperative to read the answers and study all of the areas mentioned--even the wrong answers. I received my results and passed on my first attempt. I highly recommend this book!"
2,took the test on the 20th and,"I really don't think I passed the nce and I took it yesterday in Harrisbug. The questions on the NCE were much more difficult and tricky than I could have ever imagined they would be. There was so much on the test about career counseling and statistics and the encyclopedia just did not seem to do those areas any justice. It's my own fault for not researching those subjects more than relying on the book but I assumed that the book had covered what I would need to know and I think I was wrong. In 6-8 weeks I will find out if I passed or not, and if I didn't, I will be purchasing the nce review that has been mentioned here by others. As soon as I looked at the first question and the way in which it was written, I knew I was not fully prepared."
3,Good for basic study..,More of a resource for quizzing on exam prep. It has some pointers on taking the NCE and hints that will be helpful.
2,waste of money!,"The questions are SO simple that when you actually sit down to take the NCE, you will feel totally unprepared. The actual questions are much more difficult!"
4,It helped me pass!,The format of the book is very much like taking an exam. It is 500+ pages of multiple choice questions. What is great is that the answers are indepth explanations of important concepts. This book helped to make me aware of the areas I needed to do some extra studying. Reading this book helped me to pass the exam!
5,This is the one to get,Buy this and the CD's and study for a month then pass the test and get on with your career...
1,Do Not Buy,"I took the NCE, as of this morning 10/20/07, after having read through this book 3 times over a span of about 2 months. Additionally, I purchased his audio cd series. Needless to say, nothing in either format prepared me for the NCE. The test did not contain any questions related to the material covered, or prepared me for the ambiguous questions posed by the exam.If you are looking to spend your money, Look elsewhere, Dr. Rosenthal can get rich off of someone else."
4,Fantastic for over processed hair!,"I bought this on a whim, and boy was I thrilled with the result. I have dry color treated hair and this product made it feel like silk in my hands."
3,A Disappointment,"Yagoda was a big disappointment for me. I found the writing turgid and I never quite got the organization of the book. He was handicapped by directly quoting so many different authors, whose individual styles (or writing and talking) presented a cacophony of different, clashing sounds. This is the first book I've read on writing that left me with little enlightenment."
2,"Sounds interesting, but....","I had this book for one of my writing classes. The idea behind seemed interesting and helpful. However, half the time I really had no idea what the author was talking about, and on top of that he rambles about the same thing FOREVER. I ended up skimming the chapters just to get the reading over with. I almost feel like he was more interested in wowing readers with his vocabulary than trying to explain other writers' ideas about style. Things that could take about 10 pages to say, it takes him 30. And by the end of the chapter, you still don't really have any idea what the point was because he never actually tells you. The only good thing about this book was the quotes. So, if you are required to take a class, and this book is what you need for the class, just don't take the class. This book is that bad. Or if you are just buying it because it seems interesting, you've been warned."
5,Best book I have read about writing !,"As a writer and teacher of writing for over thirty years, I have read hundreds (thousands?) of books, articles, and conference presentations on style and how to teach it. This small book, with its own engaging style, combines advice, experiences, and examples from writers we all recognize. Excellent ! It could easily replace all the stuffy anthologies usually required in college classes."
2,Incompleate order,"I ordered this book and it was supposed to came with a CD-Room, but I did not reiceived it. I sent an email to consumer services and called up and they never answer. However, I received the book in the stipulated time but for most of the activities you need the CD."
2,Contains Stevia,"This tea tastes pleasant for your first 2 or 3 sips. Then it starts tasting pretty foul. I hate, hate, hate how they put Stevia into it. If I want my tea sweeter, allow me to put my own sweetener in it. Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea, but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird, not yummy, sweet taste. I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is, but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink, I use conventional sugars that don't taste terrible.It does give a bit of a relaxing feel, but the Stevia really ruins it. I wish I could just take it out!"
3,Not worth its weight in gold.,"Of course its easy enough to ignore the plethora of research saying this stuff is beyond bad for your liver but what really takes the cake is the fact that many people [not including myself] think it tastes downright awful. Me and my friends drank this tea and while the first one or two cups were tasty, I found one of my friends complaining of how disgusting it was while the other one threw up several times. While my experience was marginally good, I can't say i would endorse this product."
4,Joint Tea,This product was recommended to my by a healthcare provider and I have found that it complements the other joint treatments I use.
3,It is what it is...,"Read up on Kava before you drink a bunch of this stuff; it has potential risks. That being said, I drink this occasionally and haven't died yet. Hard to say if it calms me or not; I'm pretty high strung all the time, would take a good massage and some anesthesia to relax me."
2,One dominant flavor that didn't work for me personally,"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise. The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat. I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that."
1,Yuck,"After reading many reviews, I thought this would be a product worth trying, boy was I wrong. Not only did it taste disgusting and required a pinching of the nose for every sip, it didn't bring me any feelings of relaxation or stress relief. I even tried two tea bags and nothing. I followed all steeping and heating instructions and still nothing. It was gross and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
2,Tested it's Effects: None,"On an empty stomach, in a controlled environment, with plenty of water, I felt no physical change to stress levels, at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax. Like homeopathic medicince (highly diluted), this product is bunk.But it tastes good, and maybe it could have a little placebo effect."
5,No counting sheep!,I love this tea! You drink it and you just quietly get tired and no med type hangover in the morning! I have a pretty high med tolerance so actually finding something to help me fall asleep is hard. It tastes good and works!
2,tea drinker,"I had been having problems sleeping, and i saw this particular tea advertised in a magazine, ordered it right away online from the supplier, good price and fast shipping. No problem with the supplier at all. The tea does make one sleepy, but the overwhelming taste of licorice makes it hard to drink, and in reading the ingredients i see that licorice root is the first ingredient."
3,a little too much,Not my cup of tea. It is a little too overpowering for me. I was looking for something purely ginger and this just wasn't it. It has notes of peppermint & licorice added. I have since tried Traditional Medicinals ginger tea and love it.
1,The Stevia...,"I tried this tea because I am an insomniac, and wanted something to help put me to sleep. Unfortunately, I can barely palette this tea because of its wretched last note and after-taste of Stevia. I have never tasted Stevia before, but after reading the other reviews I instantly knew that was the issue. It goes into my throat and just tastes disgustingly sweet. Not in a good way, either.I don't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea-- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up. So this is a complete killer for me. If you like super sweet teas, this may be for you, but I don't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea. If they're going to do that, perhaps they should make a separate version without the Stevia.I won't be purchasing this again, and I continue my hunt for very strong sleepytime teas that aren't sweet, fruity, or minty."
4,Pretty good tea.,"The taste is pretty good, although i didn't feel the stress relieving properties it was said to have. at least no more than regular tea would have on me. but still, tasted great."
2,Stevia,"Tea helps relaxation when not boiled, try boiling water and putting two iced cubes in water before steeping. Otherwise, the kavalactones are killed by the heat.This tea has awful stevia sweetener. Maybe I'm not just not used to it, but I don't like it. I don't want the tea maker deciding how sweet my tea should be, especially with this trash stevia."
2,Unbelievably awful,"I grabbed this, in audio book form, from the public library when I knew I'd be kept at home for a week while my car was being repaired. I started it while doing dishes and at first the romance was sort of fun. The dialogue, however, was really horrible...I wondered if it had been written pre-1950. The cutesiness of the conversations between the two lovers is enough to make you vomit. After listening to one disk, I put it away.When my car was not ready on the promised day and I had run out of other entertainment I reluctantly tried this again. I stuck it out while cleaning the bathroom and it seemed just the right thing to listen to while scrubbing the toilet.I noticed while in the library that there were other books written by this author; apparently she is popular and someone actually pays her money to turn out this drivvel. Egad!I admit that I've never read a ""romance"" novel before so I guess this just isn't my thing. I sure won't read anything else by this woman!!"
2,Similiar to a cheap harlequin romance novel,"Not Even For Love, by Sandra Brown is not one of her better books. This book is about as close to a cheap Harlequin romance novel that one will get. I barely got through the book - it was awful. No mystery, no character depth, totally superficial, totally predictable, totally flat, dull, and boring. I believe that Ms. Brown mentioned that the book was written in 1982 and she should have left it there. Touted as a ""classic love story, I found absolutely nothing ""classic"" about this book. Don't waste your time reading this one. Her later books are so much better."
1,"Can you say ""no"" Jordan?","Well I have not had the benefit of reading other Sandra Brown's. This was trash. I got the CD version on sale and thought it would make an entertaining car trip. Jordan is so controlled by both men. Both men want her primarily for her looks. Reeves is a little violent, Helmut is just an egotist. I almost threw it away after disc 2 but I wondered if maybe Jordan ever stood on her own two feet. She doesn't."
2,Not Even for Love,I have read quite a bit of Sandra Brown but found this particular book disappointing. It was way too predictable and a lot of the dialog was kindergarten. The good thing about this book is it is short. I would not recommend this book for reading. I will continue to read Sandra Brown because I know she can write better.
2,Bad..,I dont really know how good they work because they expire in only a month!!! I wasnt going to use theese untill later on this summer! How can a product like this expirse only in 2 months!!
4,Dying for a re-issue!,"One of the all time greatest albums. Nearly every track fills you with excitement and joy. But...this is one album that is begging for a high-resolution re-mastering and re-issue. The recording is scratchy, lacks depth, and the bass is nearly non-existent.Verve Records - Please Please PLEASE! Re-issue this classic album as a Master Edition! This should be one of the 10 most essential jazz CDs in every person's library, but it won't happen without a CD that meets the modern auditory expectation for jazz classics of this era."
4,great stuff,"An excellent album. Great variety and the Basie band really smokes on this one. One of the other reviews talked about the Sinatra/Basie lps, and they're unquestionably excellent--especially the first one. But this title has an explosive quality all its own. Well worth your time."
5,"LOUD, BRASSY AND SMOOTH","THE MID 1950'S COUNT BASIE ""NEW TESTAMENT"" BAND IS MY FAVORITE PERIOD IN HIS LONG CARRER AS A BIG BAND LEADER (NOT TOMENTION HIS SMALL COMBO RECORDINGS AS WELL). THIS IS A FANTASTIC ALBUM AND THIS NEWER, SMOOTHER, BRASSIER SOUND IS PERFECT FOR HIS VOCALIST, JOE WILLIAMS. BASIE'S EARLIER RECORDINGS WITH JIMMY RUSHING SINGING THE MALE LEAD WERE A BIT MORE FREE-SWINGING, THIS IS IS THAT SLICK, SMOOTH, TIGHT, ORCHESTRATED MUSIC THAT PUNCTUATED HIS LATER CAREER. JOE WILLIAMS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER."
5,great band leader great vocalist,two giants in music give us a great disc.joe williams was a great vocalist with a great range.count was a great band leader.his style and arrangements fit perfectly with anyone with talent.and this disc is a must have.
2,"Good music, but the quality is awful",I love Joe Williams' voice. Every Day I Have the Blues is great. But the quality of the recording [stinks]. It sounds like it was recorded in the 1920s. I regret buying this cd.
1,"An Essential Recording, You Must Be Kidding?","Listening to this album is an educational experience in the history of American music for one reason and one reason only: It helps you to understand why Frank Sinatra was the greatest singer of all time. Just listen to any one of the Sinatra-Basie albums and you'll see what I'm talking about.On this album, the Basie arrangements and the sound qaulity is absolutely ear-aching. Joe Williams sounds about as boring, montone, and lifeless as listening to a fog horn.Don't waste your time or money here when the Chairman of the Board, is the only way to listen to this kind of music."
3,"Good player, but incomplete without disc repeat func.","Everything that Sony has put on this disc works just fine. The buttons are marked in black, which is the same color as the case and the buttons themselves. It makes it quite difficult to operate the buttons. In addition, there is no option to have the entire disc to repeat. It will repeat a single song (who does that?), but can't repeat the entire disc. Otherwise this unit operates just fine."
1,flimsy,impossibly small buttons and tiny lcd.you'll need a magnifying glass for any adjustments.barely any metal to it -- which makes it light as a feather -- and probably as durablehandle with care!
3,Potatoes as the spice of life,"While this book contains many interesting recipes for new ways to prepare potatoes, the emphasis is on spicing them up and so most of the recipes have a distinctly eastern flavour. Nothing wrong with that. Potatoes lend themselves to flavour enhancement. That said, the title is somewhat misleading, because ""ultimate"" it is not. ""Ultimate"" sets up expectations of everything-one-needs-to-know-about-potatoes and all the different ways to prepare them, from basic boiled and mashed to the exotic. This book is a nice addition to the bookshelf of the enterprising cook."
4,Kindle,"I recieved a Kindle for Christmas and while I asked for it, it was hard for me to learn to comprehend the workings of it. It needs to be simplified for new users. Was hard to understand how to get into the workings and how to work it period. I have yet to read an entire book on it."
1,Silviu Szkipala,There are only 385 pages in this book not 500 as stated. I wonder who puts this informations in. Probably amazon made a mistake.
3,Basic Product,"Being a fan of this book, particularly older versions I was expecting a little more than what was received. The binding and presentation was plain, with only the book title noted on the spine, not the author. There's no index and the chapter titles aren't listed at the top of each page in the chapter. Overall, it is just continuous text cut and bound into two cardboard bindings. The delivery time was fine as well as protective packaging."
3,The Four Characterless Men,"If you are the Saint fans, you'll be also interested in ""The Four Just Men"". They are also a kind of ""Modern Robin Hoods"" who fight against the injustice beyond the reach of the Law. I read some Edgar Wallace's short stories before and they were splendid. This book is enjoyable, but not so good as I expected. Unlike the Saint, the Four Just Men lack outstanding indivisualities that attract readers. Indeed they are nondescript and distinguishable only by names. When more than one heros appear, they should display different characters or abilities."
2,Sizzle is not Steak,"This film started out interestingly enough. Kevin Spacey's ""Prot"" presented himself as a likable and quite knowledgable visitor from another planet. Of course, Dr. Mark Powell, played by Jeff Bridges was the all too human psychiatrist, assigned to uncover the inner self of his ""delusional"" patient. But it was however, difficult to explain Prot's rather unusual characteristics such as his capacity to see ultraviolet light, an arcane knowledge of the stars, and to seemingly disappear at will, among other things. These things were all used as beautiful set-up for a fresh approach to an interesting premise, but then the film suddenly bogged down as if the writers were at a loss and said to themselves ""okay, now what do we do?"" The film, in my opinion slipped badly starting with the hypnotic trance scenes. So in the end, the viewer was free to fill in the blanks with a personal take on the question of the moment. Was he real or was he Memorex?"
3,Starts out strongs but fades toward the end.,"This movie was great in the early stages when Kevin Spacey was, well, spacey. He had a knowledge of astrophysics that only 3 or 4 of the preeminent astrophysicists in the world shared. He gave an awesome display of unexplainable intellect that left the scientists awestruck. He had tremendous insight to the emotional disorders of people around him. Then, it happens. The story just sort of falls apart and leaves a whole lot of unanswered. There is no denouement - no resolution - no tying together of loose ends. If only that were accomplished this would have been an extraordinary movie. As it is, close, but no cigar."
5,I like movies that make you think.,"I saw this movie on TV last year and enjoyed it so much, I decided I wanted a copy for my video library."
5,Brilliant,"What a performance. what a movie, suspense, intrigue, it had it all. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges were equally wonderful. Whoever wrote this story was brilliant. I truly believed Mr. Spacey was from K-Pax.His handling of the other mental patients showed a depth of understanding and common sense no doctor could begin to understand. Obviously Mr. Spacey had walked a mile in their shoes."
4,Prot: Alien or Delusional Human?,"This was one of those powerful movies that I ""took personally""--especially since the blue jay is my totem and the blue jay figures a prominent role in this movie.Kevin Spacey plays a psychiatric patient named Prot--but Prot claims he's really an alien from the planet K-PAX. Jeff Bridges plays Prot's psychiatrist and is convinced that Prot is delusional. But the Doctor's cynicism soon turns into fascination. Could Prot possibly be an alien? Or is there a perfectly logical, ""earthly"" reason for Prot's belief that he's an alien?I don't want to give away any plot points, but this movie is thought provoking and utterly fascinating. You'll be scratching your head at the end--but a part of you will ""get"" it even if your mind does not. Some mystical themes I enjoyed in this movie is the existence of aliens, the possible messages of aliens, the power of belief in something beyond yourself, and the power of the mind."
2,"If you must, rent... but don't buy","I really wanted to like this movie because the concept has such potential. But, it had so many [incorrect] scenes! Arrested just for saying you're from another planet, in NY? The ... hypnosis scenes which take up most of the last half of the movie. The typical left-wing idea that the ""village"" can raise your children, parents are stupid human concepts and other socialist/utopian themes.Some movies are so bad, they're funny. This one isn't even funny. Save your money."
2,Remake... no more,"Film lovers know this movie is no more than the Hollywood version of the awarded Argentinan film ""Hombre mirando al sudeste"" (Man facing southeast) of 1986. The difference however, is that the latter is way more profound and philosophic. For those interested, I highly recommend the Argentinan film, although it is very difficut to get outside Latin America, especially with english subtitles."
2,K Pax,"Two-thirds of the way through K-PAX I decided that only a great ending was going to redeem this movie. Unfortunately, it ended with a skittering thud and had me muttering ""What the huh?"" Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are good enough to make their scenes together interesting, but the story is pretty confused. A rental at best."
1,Man Facing Southeast remake?,"In the credits no reference is made to the remarquable 1986 Argentinean film ""Man Facing Southeast"". Even if there is no admitted connection between the two, K-PAX could easily be mistaken for a remake of this movie, and not a very good remake at that. It lacks the deapt and refinement of the ""original"". So why bother with K-PAX, if you can find ""Man Facing Southeast"" treat yourself to a real masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made."
1,Shoot this one into outer space.,"With movies like *American Beauty*, *Pay It Forward*, the recently released *The Shipping News*, and this turkey, *K-PAX*, the name of Kevin Spacey is becoming associated in my mind with mawkish, pretentious, and just downright bad films. In this one, he plays Prot, who is either a genuine spaceman or just a garden-variety madman. No matter which, really: he's annoying either way. Spacey phones this performance in (from outer space?), content to hide behind a pair of dark sunglasses and his trademark smug smirk. His co-star, Jeff Bridges, as the psychiatrist who is reluctant to believe that Prot is really an alien, is humiliatingly subordinate -- constantly made a fool of by the Spacey character, constantly one-upped. (Even the cover art for the DVD conveys this.) Surely Bridges deserves better . . . to say nothing of the audience."
4,Very good Movie Buuut...,The Ending is very confusing. Which i guess was the point. To get you to come to your own conclusion. On one hand you think he is human but then how did he know all that stuff about that distant Solar System. Where did that Women at the end go? Then you think well he was an Alien. But then What about the sessions he had where he went back in time? The year book pic? That prooves he was a human. But that doesn't explain how he knew all that stuff lol. Just confussing lol.
3,OK Movie,"Nice movie, nice acting, specially Kevin Spacey, in a very spacey performance. VERY similar to a mid 80s Argentinefilm, called Man Facing Southeast."
5,wow.,"after all these years, i saw the film. it touched me. i bought a copy of the dvd. then after all these years, i took a class ""introduction to film."" as part of our final assignments, we had to choose a scene from a film, to review aloud in front of the class. i chose this film... K-PAX. and i highlighted how the doctor is trying to have Prot merely ""consider"" that he might actually be Robert. but Robert/Prot counters, by asking the Doctor to consider that it might be true, that Prot is his name and that he is from the planet K-pax."
5,Intriguing!,"This is a great movie that manages to intertwine psychological and philosophical aspects. Kevin Spacey as Prot is incredible and Jeff Bridges as a psychiatrist is extremely good too. The story is complex in many ways and at the same time perplexing to the viewer. Is Prot really from the planet K-Pax or is he suffering from some psychological disorder, in this case most likely multiple personality disorder? I am not even sure that the ending provides a reasonable explanation. See this movie, it will make you think!"
2,I'd rather watch the un-credited original movie...,"...although I really like Kevin Spacey. He's a great actor and he does a great job in here, but 'Man facing South-East' the original Argentinean movie was way better than the american version.And I still can't believe that the director won't recognize that the movie was 101% based on that south-american gem."
3,superpawn dvd's,"very good product. 13 items bought at the same time, combined shipping was not considered. shipping for 13 dvd's was $35.00 which is outrageous. there shipping cost was $8.00 ........ should improve the combined shipping policy........ would buy more items from you if shipping was not so un-reasonable."
2,Interesting Idea-Terrible Execution,"When I first heard of this movie I thought it was a remake of the great Argentinian movie ""Man Facing Southeast"". The plot is almost the same but that's where the similarities end. ""Man Facing Southeast"" was an intelligent movie while this was a slow moving, dissapointing mess.From the first scene I knew it was not a very good script. Why was Kevin Spacey's character arrested and taken to a mental hospital, just for saying he was from another planet? Come on, this is Grand Central in New York. Do you think New York police arrest every nut on the street without any valid reason? It just seemed that much of the action in this film was forced, just to move the plot along with no regard for some semblance of reality.Some great actors were totally wasted in this film. Better luck next time!"
3,Entertaining,"A man named Prot arrives in Grand Central terminal and claims to be from outer space. They stick him in a mental hospital. Dr. Mark Powell is his psychiatrist. Prot almost convinces us, and Dr. Powell, that there is a possibility he just be from outer space. We want him to be. You're dying to find out. Entertaining."
5,Safe and Sound...,"K-PAX is a well-written, flawlessly directed and acted allegory about Identity. People who cannot see that, may not like it. Those who can, will appreciate its nuances and the sheer understated genius of the entire package."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"I fail to understand why a lot of people dislike this movie. From the beginning scene I was captivated and never moved out of my seat till the end, and it still had me thinking until the next day. I admit, it does seem a little confusing and leaves a few strings loose in the end, but that seems to add to the brilliance of this movie. If you loved movies like Phenomenon, Michael, City of Angels, Starman, etc I highly recommend this. Absolutely beautiful!"
4,bUENOS PANTALONES,MUY BUENOS PANTALONES LA TALLA FUE LA CORRECTA SIN PROBLEMA EL PRECIO MUY BUENO Y SIN DIFICULTAD EN EL ENVÍO DE LOS MISMOS
3,Good quality but so-so fit,"Dickies is quality, no doubt. These pants are durable and well-made, but they don't fit so good. The Traditional fit style really doesn't accomodate us guys that might have tree-trunk thighs or a big backside, ya know? Even if you get the waist and length bigger than your size, it might be tighter on the legs than anticipated."
5,Great Pants...,I love these pants; Dickies are the best. The quality and durability are long lasting. Will definitely buy again soon.
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE,"These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel ""FAKE"""
4,"quality good, but fit not very good.","the original 874 is a little too big on the thigh, so it look a oversized pant on me.the quality is good."
3,they liked them,person i got these for had no complaint they were the brand and style they liked to wear. Have not heard back anything negitive
5,a workhorse classic.,"What can you say about Dickies. A classic brand for the workman. Reinforced knees and crotch make sure proper lifting techniques (with the legs) don't rip or ruin the trousers. heavy fabric in the waistband also make sure a belt doesn't deform or ruin the waistband. If you're a working man you need a pair of Dickies, nuff said."
4,Skateboarding teenager loves Dickies work pants,"My 16 year old son will wear only Dickies traditional work pants. This is cool because they last longer than most jeans and cost a little less. He says the cell phone pocket models are a looser fit, so he won't wear them and sticks with the traditionals. The only wear problem he has is that the front pockets tend to get holey because he jams his wallet, cell phone, and keys all into his front pocket. Sometimes I have trouble finding his skinny size, 30x32, but am usually able to find them online. They come out nicely from the wash, and if you choose black like he does, you don't have to worry about any stains.Peace out,Ed's Mom"
4,Since high school...,"I have had Dickies pants/shorts on and off since high school. I used to skateboard much more than I do now, and find that these are quite durable. The regular 874 pants have the best fit out of all the other selections available. The only thing I don't like is they attract lint a little too much."
5,Why buy jeans when you can buy Dickies?,"Dickies makes a quality product. The fabric is super durable, comfortable after a few washes, and the cut of the pants is classic. I purchased two pair for my husband and he claims that he will never buy jeans again - they just don't compare to Dickies when it comes to durability. The waist measurements run a little small, so I recommend ordering one waist size larger. Luckily, my husband had already discovered this before I ordered these and the next size up fits perfectly!"
3,Pants,"The pants themselves are real good. But the pants pockets are made of such a stiff materal that after you sit down, objects in the pockets will work their way out."
3,Dickies,The fit was good just did not like the product.It was OK just was not expecting the material to be so stiff.
4,Good work pants,"These are excellent work pants. They are durable and do not require any other attention besides washing. They get ironed every couple of washes to maintain the pleats, and hold nice pleats for about three wash cycles."
1,wrong color,"i ordered gray and they sent green. GREEN, come on guys really? at least they were the right size. well done"
1,declined in quality,I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly. I think they must be cutting costs on quality control...
3,dickie's chinos,"The product arrive somewhat late, but it did arrive, and it was what I ordered. So, the experience was satisfactory."
5,What I expected!,Great product and fast shipping. I W\will buy more later. Material is sewn together well. No frays at all. Durable fabric that will stand up to some rugged use.
5,It's what we wanted.,"These are very durable pants. My son has been wearing them in one form or the other since 1st grade. Now in the 9th grade, they're not just durable, they're pretty fashionable too. Seller shipped them out in a timely manner."
2,Tight and small,"These pants, for me, where a bit tighter than I thought it would be, also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped."
2,Seems like counterfeit product..,"I've been buying Dickies,particularly the 874's for over 20 years and I wasn't impressed with these ones at all..While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product,it didn't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin, and the pants had no factory crease..Live and learn.."
3,Sizing seems off....,"I would return the pants if I could, unfortunately I've never NOT fit into a size 36 before so I had taken off all the tags/stickers/etc. off the pants before trying them on. Stupid me.That being said, my ONLY complaint is that this 36 feels more like a 34/35. 36 is usually a perfect fit for me or sometimes a little loose but just a little.This is the first time I've put on a pair of 36w pants where I couldn't actually button the button or zip up the zipper all the way. I even had to do the ""Jump and tug"". You know...where you have to jump and then tug the pants up to get them on....which was a bad sign by itself.Now OTHER than that, the pants are nice. They look great and the parts that fit on me, felt great lol.Now this could just be a fluke, maybe it's a pant that got the wrong size put on it or any other of the 100 things that can go wrong during production, but the pair I received most certainly isn't a 36w."
2,Different Sizing,"Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more. And they're straight leg, not boot cut, so there's a bit of a taper at the ankle."
5,Best Book on Elizabeth I,"I've read almost a dozen books on the Tudors and this is the best on Elizabeth I. Although I usually get my doses of the Tudors from Alison Weir and Antonia Fraser, Anne Somerset has truly written and organized a beautiful book. An impressive work -- better than any other I've read on the world's greatest monarch."
4,"Very good read, but...","A very good historical novel (unknown if every circumstance is true). However, for me at times, the amount of detail was tedious."
2,"Passable, dated 1960s comedy","I first saw this movie many years ago on late night television. It looks like it was done on a much more modest budget than any of the Blake Edwards films. Despite the Clouseau character, this isn't nearly as madcap as it should have been, and often comes across as a made-for-TV 60s comedy. Alan Arkin's done much better work than this and to his credit does his best to make the character his own rather than an impersonation. Die-hard fans of the series will probably want to see this movie for the sake of completeness. But without Peter Sellers, Blake Edwards and Henry Mancini is there any reason to have a Pink Panther movie?"
3,"Funny, but PG","I truly enjoyed Alan Arkin in this film, and found some of the scenes absolutely hilarious!Deserving of a ""G"" rating it is not, however. ""PG"" would better inform prospective viewers."
4,Not The Best!,"This is Definately not The Best Pink Panther film. It is not as good as the other ones that I've seen. I've only seen The Pink Panther {1964}, A Shot In The Dark, this one, and The Pink Panther {2006}. If you are into the Pink Panther series just for Peter Sellers, you won't like this one. This film has a great cast.Alan Arkin as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, Frank Finlay as Supt. Weaver, Barry Foster as Addison Steele, Patrick Cargill as Commisioner Sir Charles Braithwaite, Beryl Reid as the crazed Mrs. Weaver, Clive Francis as Johnny Rainbow, and introducing Delia Boccardo as Lt. Lisa Morrel. You will definately laugh hysterically. As Inspector Clouseau says, ""There's a time for laughing and a time for not laughing- and this is not one of them!"""
1,Did Arkin even watch the other versions?,"I had not heard of this film until I found it in a bargin bin at one of my local DVD shops. For a few dollars I thought it might be worth a go,......wrong! This had to be one of the worst spinoffs that I have ever come across. It makes me wonder if the script writers and Arkin had even bothered to watch any of the other versions. Arkin comes across as an arrogant tot, not like the much beloved fumbling fool as we have come to know in other films. The language he uses it nothing like what we have come to expect from the inspector, and the accents are some of the worst on screen, and if not for the scenery of the day, it's hard to find anything worth watching in this film. I had to fast forward to the end, just to see if there might be anything of interest. Unless you can find this for a dollar in a used ex-rental bin, don't bother with it."
2,Brave attempt,"I'm a great fan of the Pink Panther series and a great fan of Alan Arkin. Some reviewers make much of the fact that Arkin doesn't attempt to recreate Sellers character bringing his own take to the film. I, however, believe in not following the formula more closely than he did as created by Sellers in the first two movies, some of Clousseau is also lost. The opening segment of the Inspector disembarking the plane is about as close as the character gets to the one we know so well. Sure, there are flashes of humour throughout but at times you're left questioning whether your watching a comedy or a drama. If you're a die hard fan by all means purchase this for posterity but don't expect it to see the light of day from the shelf too often if at all. As much as it tries to emulate it's predecessors it never quite makes the grade."
2,Inspector C-lose-owwww!!,"Despite the presence of screen great Alan Arkin in the title role, INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU mostly falls on its face. I think the problem with this movie is that the character of Clouseau was still in its infancy - leaving Arkin (and the writers) little to go on. There is no Chief Inspector Dreyfus. No Phantom. No Cato. No Pink Panther.It wasn't until THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER that Inspector Clouseau became a huge success. And that was because he became more of an overblown - but lovable - cartoonish character.I will have to admit that the musical score by Ken Thorne is one of the few highlights of the movie. His main title theme ranks amongst those of the immortal Henry Mancini.Interestingly enough, INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU is better than any of the Pink Panther movies which followed after Peter Seller's passing."
2,And now for something not so different after all,"I overcame my reservations about this movie because, well, it has Alan Arkin. He's funny, right?Well not in this thing, though you can tell that he's trying, but he's dealing with lousy direction, a horrible script, and he's trying to play a character that has been definitively played by one of the comic geniuses of the century.The plot, as feeble as can be expected for the genre, would actually have some interesting potential if it could have exploited today's digital technology. Imagine a dozen Clouseau's bumping into each other as they all accidentally rob the same bank.I haven't seen the other Clouseau flicks recently enough to remember if they all were like this, but this G-rated flick had enough gay innuendo to almost consider that this was brilliantly hidden subversive material. Somehow, though, I doubt it."
3,Inspector Cleoseau,"I own every other movie in the Pink Panther sereis, that is the reason I would like to own this video if possible, when the video comes back into stock,and if I or if I don't win A certifcate I would like to buy the video. I thank you for having the video, and for your time. Christopher Stone"
4,"Nancy Wilson, Live in Las Vegas","Another classic artist from the past. Close your eyes, imagine you are in Vegas during the golden era of the Rat Pack with Hall of Fame entertainers at all the Strip hotels, and then listen to one of best female vocalists of the era. Fantastic!! Las Vegas is 100 years old, and Nancy Wilson helped make it that way. Get this CD and cherish it."
2,Raven's Sign,I purchased this product and it was only partially as expected. I didn't see anywhere that this was intended to be window sign. I was expecting to be able to hang this on a wall. However there are these posts that go around the sign which cannot be removed. It looks a little strange hanging on the wall since it clearly is intended to be against a window. I was somewhat disappointed. I wish this was noted that its intended to be hung in a window not on a wall.
5,cashin is my hero,"for anyone who does'nt know, mr.peter cashin was the leader of the newfoundland independence party in the now famous 1948-49 confederation vote in newfoundland as to whether the island should become indepedant or join canada.as everyone knows ,mr.cashin's party lost {quite sadly i must say seeing i'm a newfoundland nationalist}to the confederation party lead by the universally known{at least in newfoundland and canada]joseph smallwood or joey smallwood as he is better known.this book is a great read as it is written by mr.cashin himself.this book gives you insight to what this man was all about and what he believed in.mr cashin is almost forgotten today in newfoundland,which is quite sad cause it's obvious he truly loved newfoundland like all of us newfoundlanders do.thank you mr.cashin for a great book and for all the years you dedicated to our people.this book is recommended to all newfoundlanders and those interested in newfoundland history."
2,a hot start with a cold follow-up,"I was riveted for the first 60 pages or so... the implications of the story at this point are profound, a thriller which places the contest of ethics and science on stage. Then, inexplicably, Nagata changes pace and it slows considerably.After losing the science/thriller pace, the story leaves doesn't drive to a full examination of the theme; other central characters, including the enigmatic ""Mother Tiger,"" remain forever obscured by mystery.Entertaining, but the utterly profound examination of the central question, having been abandoned, the novel languishes. After almost finishing, I left the remaining 40 pages or so many days before I summoned up the gumption to finish it."
2,A Setup for a Sequel,"Nagata sets up the big questions in this book and then punts at the end. Her maturation as a writer happens right in front of our eyes but don't buy this book. The ending can only be described as 1) A cliffhanger designed to get you to buy the sequel, or 2) A failure of literary courage. In either case, this is editorial irresponsibility at its most heinous. Even the most transparent first book of a series resolves the major plot elements and answers the questions raised by the narrative. Not this time.None of this would matter if Nagata had written just another media tie-in, dumbed down and evanescent as rime. But it isn't. As Norman Spinrad noted in his review in the March 2002 Asimov's, this is a spectacularly well-written tale for literate adults, all too rare in the current market. If you must have more Nagata, enjoy the setup but don't expect a payoff. It isn't there"
3,It works fine,Seems to hold a charge a little better than the LG Original eqip battery for a lot less money!
4,Don't go into the Okefenokee without it!,"My tattered and stained copy has been an integral part in planning each of my six trips into the Okefenokee. I personally could do without all of the details on the various plant species but I love the in-depth descriptions on what is around virtually every turn. Traveling from Virginia, I could have also used more information on area camping and lodging. In addition, I love fishing on my trips into the Okefenokee but the book essentially ignores the topic. While the book could be improved upon, it is a fascinating and invaluable resource for anyone interested in experiencing the magic of an Okefenokee wilderness canoe trip."
4,Good Guide,"Look forward to using for a future kayak trip. The book provides thorough information, maps, and details. A good book."
2,"Good Pillow but beware, HORRIBLE customer service","I am a light sleeper with neck problems and really like Pacific Coast's AllerRest all-down pillows. When I called the company for pillow information, a customer service rep told me one price but when I went to order online the website listed a higher price. I sent customer service two emails asking for clarification. No response. I called twice but only got their voice mail. I saw later on that other customers also complained about the companies poor customer service. So BEWARE!"
4,Solid buy,"If you're a collector of Partch works, like myself, and enjoy the full experience of something (or as close as it comes through video and sound)This is a good buy. African American Kabuki? Seems to be close."
2,Very disapointing,"This review is only about the ""delusions of fury"" part of the DVD, and not about the documentary.Since I already own the CD with the music for this DVD,The main reason for me buying this was the 5.1 surround option and the video.The video quality on ""delusions"" is pretty bad, and frankly, it is very boring, especially compared to the music.My second disapointment came from the soundtrack-I could not get the 5.1 option to work, no matter how hard I tried, I have the feeling that there is indeed no such option at all.If you do not know the music on this DVD, you should buy the excellent and mesmerising ""delusions of fury"".If you do know the music on this DVD, dont bother buying it- there is no added value- the documentary is interesting, Partch is a genious with a capital G, but its not something I would sit and watch repeatedly."
5,Great!,"Marvin Martian - Space tunes (VHS)_ Great cartoon too bad it is not available in DVD, will order again soon."
5,"A french fan from Paris, france","If you have to buy only one album of IAM , then buy "" l'ecole du micro d'argent "" . It's wonderfull , you'll listen it thousands times without boring yourself ! If you want to have any information about french Rap , write me..."
3,ca va plus ou moins..,"This is a decent example of French rap, but certainly not the best. It lies somewhere in between Solaar for his pure, fun pop lyrics and NTM's hard core scene. It lacks a bit of character. Je suis plutot Parisien que Marseillais, donc c'est peut-etre ca (NTM over IAM)? There are a couple of decent songs- Une Femme Seule has good lyrics and comes straight from the haert. Je Danse Le Mia is a terribly tacky song that is popular among the FunRadio and Skyrock crowd. I saw a funny incident on french tv- IAM performed at an award show and after finishing said"" Attention- L'OM va mettre le feu ce soir"". The crowd got pumped up and cheered wildly. Pascal Obispo performed shortly after and said ""Moi, je suis bordelais et donc allez les girondins"". His soft quiet voice did not quite have the same effect and people clapped politely.By the way, OM est dans la merde cette saison..."
5,Ombre est Lumière et IAM ze King,"D'accord, ""L'École de Micro d'Argent"", c'est génial et je le recommande à tous ceuxcelles qui aiment la musique. Mais il ne faudrait pas oublier que ""Ombre est Lumière"" est le premier, l'original , la source de leur génie. Les pauses dans le rythme et les lyrics délirantes sont l'essence d'IAM, et leur premier album le démontre très bien. Mes préférées son Ombre est Lumière et l'Aimant, mais les autres sont aussi géniales."
3,great group of stars-not bad quality recording either,lots of stars with ella and eldridge and of course bird-great for bebop lovers or great jazz collectors in general
2,Elvis' Formula One,"Pairing Elvis Presley with Nancy Sinatra may have sounded good on paper, but there is no chemistry on celluloid. In all fairness, not even Ann-Margret could have redeemed ""Speedway."" There are a few good songs (especially Elvis' classic ""Let Yourself Go"") and the stock-car footage is fairly enjoyable. Otherwise, strictly Formula One. Released in June 1968, ""Speedway"" gave little indication of the triumphant Presley comeback just around the corner."
3,Just Good Clean Fun !!,"I saw Speedway at the drive-in in the summer of 1968 ! so it holds a special place in my mind.Not a bad movie .. and a few good songs.Let Yourself Go featured in this movie was also featured in the 68 Elvis tv special.Nancy Sinatra looks very hot in this movie,and Elvis as always is his cool self.A good family film !!!"
4,Typical Elvis,This is a very typical Elvis movie. It was fun to watch and a fun way to while away some time.
4,Racers other than Elvis,"I give Elvis a thumbs up on this one. ""Speedway"" is entertaining, perhaps not his best film, but definitely worth watching. Elvis was in his prime (physically) for this entry.But mainly, I dropped in here to let folks know that there's a movie (a pretty awful one) about Tiny Lund, who co-starred in ""Speedway,"" and who was a REAL racecar driver. Tiny, a huge and endearing fellow, won the Daytona 500 in 1963. It's called ""Tiny Lund: Hard Charger!"" If you're a drooling NASCAR fan you might want to see it, although it's hard to find.In any case, that's my two-cent's worth."
3,Presley & Sinatra don't take us along for the ride,"Granted, Elvis Presley, great entertainer that he was, was by no means the world's best actor. Very few singers-turned-actors make it, and by chance he did. However, reasons for his popularity as an actor most likely were carried over from his incredible success as a singer. Nancy Sinatra, also a great entertainer, starred in a handful of movies, and like Elvis, does not retain any credible acting ability. Thus, they are the perfect match for each other in ""Speedway."" The humor is pure corn, the songs are so-so, the story is borderline pathetic. Therefore, all the fun Elvis and Nancy are having in this film (and it is evident making this film was fun) does not carry over to the audience. They're both charming, but complimenting more is stretching it. Highlight: Nancy mustering up some love and affection on her rousing solo, ""Your Groovy Self."""
2,I'M A PRESLEY FAN BUT I AM EVEN GETTING BORED!,"Ok, I wish Presley would have stopped acting earlier for the sake of movies. But since he didn't, and I have seen this lousy acted movie, I have to admit this flick shows him at his all time low. The usual singing, racing, and fighting goes on but didn't he just do that in about 30 other movies. I am a fan but lets do something different huh? I could turn the volume down and tell you what was going to happen. Good for a nap but that about it."
2,"""Viva Las Vegas 2""? Not really...","By 1967, enough was enough with the light fluff comedies starring Elvis Presley. Throughout the 60s, Elvis was being humiliated making bad movies like TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM while The Beatles and Bob Dylan were changing the music scene.In SPEEDWAY, Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the third time!) who gets into trouble with the IRS. He falls in love with Nancy Sinatra, and that's about it for the plot.The only saving grace is that the cast is better than average. It's quite interesting to see Elvis act alongside ""Lucy"" regular Gale Gordon. The songs are a little better than average, especially the quite good ""Let Yourself Go"".Again, it's not that bad. It's a definite improvement over CLAMBAKE, but a far cry from JAILHOUSE ROCK or KING CREOLE."
2,Speedway,"Okay here is my opinion. One of my favorite actors in the whole universe is Bill Bixby. If Bill had not been in this movie, I would've gave it 1 star. I have respect for Elvis as a singer but he could not act worth a lick! This is another typical Elvis movie, that you just sit through it and by the end of it you think to yourself that you have spent 50 years watching this movie. I think that what makes me like it a bit is because of Bill Bixby being in it.Jenny"
5,Works well,I've only used it for a few days and it has worked a lot and I would buy this product again and recommend it to others as well.
4,Not as good as others but good enough...,I wanted to try this one because it's an actual brand and supposed to be the best... blah blah.. but... it really wasn't the best i've ever used. Don't get me wrong... the product DOES work.. but just not the best for the price. I've bought the cheaper brand and it actually worked better.
3,Needs more adhesive,"I agree with the last reviewer. These strips probably do work, but it's difficult to tell when they do not stay in place. Last night and this morning I tried to do my normal activities for the 30 minutes that they strips were supposed to stay adhered to my teeth, and by the time I took them off, they were misplaced on my teeth. I will be returning mine and trying other Crest strips, as I have read how there are more effective / adhesive ones to use."
3,don't stay on well,I didn't see a very noticeable difference when I completed the whitening kit but my biggest complaint would be that the bottom strip would always slip off.
1,Bummer,If you have crooked teeth like me - be alert - it really doesn't work because the strips won't stay on the whole 1/2 hour.
1,No Whitening Whatsoever,"I had high hopes for these, but after using them I couldn't see the slightest difference and neither could my husband. :("
4,"Messy, but works!","Be prepared for a nasty taste and slimy, slippery strips. But they really did work well. Don't believe the commercials that you can use these anytime, anywhere. Not unless you don't mind drooling on people in public. The strips slip all over when you try to talk or even swallow, and especially DON'T SNEEZE! But as for the whitening, I was pleasantly surprised. A lot better than I was expecting."
3,"DEFINITELY WORK if you follow the directions, but the pain... oh my god...","No doubt about it, these strips work. I've gotten countless compliments on how white and beautiful my smile is. I haven't used them in about a year, but today I decided to resume my whitening again with a new box of premium whitestrips. After about 4 minutes of wearing the strips, I experienced the WORST PAIN I EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. It felt as it the pain was coming from inside my bottom teeth, and I actually was nauseated from the pain, that's how severe it was. I immediately ripped off the strips and rinsed out my mouth, and now I'm PETRIFIED to attempt using them again. Does anyone know if this is normal? Please email me and let me know why this happened!! (thethugyone@aol.com)."
1,Not worth the pain.,"I was very excited to try this product. After just 1 day I had terrible pain but as the directions say to do, I stuck with it. For about 2 weeks afterwards I still had a tremendous amount of pain. And the product didn't work. I called the manufacturer to get my money back and found out that they no longer make this product and that it was actually expired. Thanks Amazon."
3,Expected more,"After 3 days I did notice a difference. However, thinking my teeth were going to continue to get whiter over the next couple days, but they did not. I was expecting way more. I feel like my teeth are already almost back to their normal color and it's only been a few weeks and I am not a smoker/ wine drinker. Next time I want to whiten my teeth I think I'll just save me time and go to the dentist to have them done."
1,Rembrant works without pain or annoying strips,"This product is so different than the tv says. The strips are really hard to put on, and they only cover a 8 teeth, when 10 teeth show when you smile. So unless you put the excess stips on the rest, you have some white, and some yellow teeth when you smile. The strips are hard to keep on for 20 minutes, and the product tastes gross.I paid 40 bucks for these, and half are still in the box. I went out and bought the 20 dollar Rembrant set with the gel and trays and it works so much better. The gel stays on the teeth and tastes like a pleasant toothpaste. It whitens and the trays are easy to keep in. I will throw-out the Crest strips, if I can't give them away...do not use them!"
2,Barely Noticeable Difference After Two Boxes,"I'm 19 and tried Crest Whitestrips Premium expecting great results. After finishing one box and using it correctly, my teeth were maybe half a shade whiter. Since Crest will send a free box to anyone who is unhappy with their results (awesome offer), I requested a box and it arrived within three weeks. I used the second box and it whitened my teeth maybe another half a shade. Overall my teeth are basically the same shade. I was hoping that the Whitestrips would actually whiten my teeth, but they are still yellow! They are also a little hard to keep on, but it gets easier with each use."
3,NOT TOO IMPRESSED,I was highly disappointed with the strips. I expected them to stick to my teeth but instead they're hard to keep in place. I did NOT get white teeth. I didn't even see a difference. I know there are people out there who are happy with them but my guess is they used them many times to get good results.
4,Works Pretty Good,"The whitestrips worked pretty good. I experienced no sensitivity, and only minor burning to my gums. I can't really say how well it works long term, but the short term effects were good. Overall the product is a great value and a good buy."
4,Close to expire,"This is a very good product, and a good price for it, but they send me the product close to expire, that's the only thing that I don't like."
2,Doesn't stay in place,Can't really judge how well they work becuase they keep sliding around on my teeth. Within a few miinutes on putting them on they're sliding and I haven't been able to keep them on my teeth more than about 10 minutes.
1,Won't use again,"I used the white strips once, but didn't even finish the package because they're such a hassle. I found that after a while the strips simply stop adhering to my teeth and I literally can't keep them in place inside my mouth for the recommended time - they end up wadding up like plastic wrap. Since I had braces, my teeth are very straight, so I switched to Aquafresh white trays, which worked out much better for me as they are VERY easy to keep in place."
4,It works but...,"This product really works but... if you have tooth coldness problem (I don't have better word for that) you will be using the strip once in two days. It makes sensitive teeths more sensitive. Other then that do what it says, and available in a good price."
2,okay.,"not all that, i somewhat think that i saw a change in my teeth but i think it was my imagination lol. it was annoying trying to adjust them & whatnot. its best to do the upgrade. well at least i like the taste lol."
1,I can't believe I wasted my time doing that.,"I'm a coffee/tea drinker; I bought the stripes to try to combat some yellowness from that. I wasn't expecting supermodel teeth-- just a noticeable improvement. The bottom line is that they didn't work. I can think of a million things I wish I'd bought with the money instead.I also experienced the tooth sensitivity that other reviewers have described. It has been 3 days since I stopped using them, and my gums still do not feel right. I cannot believe this is truly a safe product for repeated use.In addition, I am a small person with small teeth. The stripes barely covered enough teeth for me."
3,Its Okay,I tried this but it doesn't that well. I purchased another product called bright teeth and gives excellent results. You can check it out at physicallyfitandhealthy.wetpaint.com
4,Worked well.,"My teeth and gums are pretty sensitive so I thought it might be wise to stay away from these after reading some of the reviews, however I was able to use them with no pain at all. The only thing I disliked about them was that they were extremely annoying to deal with and the taste it would leave."
1,Crest Doesn't Live Up To Its Guarantee,"These white strips didn't do a darn thing for me, not even a tiny bit whiter. What really galls me is the ""guarantee or your money back"". I sent in my receipt along with the bar code, just as instructed, and never received anything back - this was 5 months ago."
1,my teeth are in screaming pain,"After the first application I felt a little soreness on the area where I applied the strips. This morning I did the second application and now my teeth are in terrible, distracting pain. I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive teeth."
5,Love the Classics,Really enjoyed reading the story the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Loved seeing the illustrations included in the book.
1,Wasnt what I expected,"My family has a history of Dyslexia, so comic books are hard to read. So when my mother told me that had a Christmas Carol, Batman classic for sale, I was thrilled. Needless to say, there was no Batman and I wasted my time and money wondering when we were going to see the caped crusader kicking ebeneezers arse."
4,Very good . I liked it a lot!,The words may be a little old-fashioned but with the kindle it's easier to read and joyful with a little imagination. As Tiny Tim would say God bless us everyone. Not just America.
1,Poorly done e-book,"Beware, this edition contains all sorts of unmappable punctuation, resulting in irritating replacement characters appearing in place of every apostrophe."
1,maybe good but definitely NOT the unabridged recording,"once again, (OK it does not happen that often, otherwise we would stop trusting Amazon and shopping with them, would'nt we?) the description is not accurate : this version ISBN 1569945233, monterey media etc.... is an ADAPTATION of Dicken's novel by the St Charles PLayers, who record it with all due talent and spirit BUT as a play, in an ""exciting Radio Theater style"" quote, unquote....."
5,Beautiful Volume,"I collect ""A Christmas Carol"" and this is a particularly lovely volume. The illustrations are wonderful and the overall quality, printing, binding and paper, is terrific. This is definitely in my top three favorites of all the different versions I own."
2,A Choppily Abridged Carol,"Although the artwork in this book is great, readers should be warned that the text is a heavy-handed abridgement of Charles Dickens's wonderful little novel. It omits far too much of the rich and colorful language of this stirring novelette."
5,Classic,Classic. Not sure how I made it this long in life without reading this story. As usual... book is better than movies.
4,Some formatting issues,"The story is obviously amazing and I won't attempt to contribute anything there. There are some formatting issues though, mostly in the form of extra line break inexplicably inserted in the middle of paragraphs, and not distracting enough to detract from the overall reading experience. Also worth noting is the lack of an interactive table of contents."
5,Just what I wanted!!! Yay!!!!!!,"Why is it so darn hard to find this story unabridged??Is it really so hard to understand or keep kids attention these days??To me, if you are going to bother reading a classic, read the whole thing as the author wrote it. Otherwise you are reading someone else's work.This book is not only the full story, it is beautifully illustrated. It is a wonderful edition and one that will be an heirloom, remembered by little ones when they are grown up and reading it to their little ones.I looked far and wide for an edition that was unabridged and lovely enough to come out every Christmas and this is absolutely the one and I'm so happy to have it!!"
2,Not the best,I think that the book is boring for the most part but it is a really old book so I understand why I hated it.
5,Merry Christmas,I was looking for something to put me in the mood and this book was just what I needed. So traditional. But I had a little trouble at first reading it ; however I picked it up fast and really enjoying it.
5,a Christmas classic,"I have read this book many times. If you have not read it, do yourself a favor and download it and read it now. Don't wait for ChristmasThe Kindle version is easy to read.."
5,A Christmas Carol,It was great I loved this book it was the best and it is all about Christmas time with families
4,Great Reading,"Mr. Baker does a fine job of bringing life to the characters. He does read at a brisk pace so I might have a print copy of the story on hand the next time the family listens to it. Good, clear sound. However, while listening to it in the car we almost had it at full volume because Mr. Baker's would read so softly (and quickly) at times we could barely hear him. We haven't listened to it at home so it might be a different experience."
5,"Great Book, Great Price",I am a fan of Christmas books and Charles Dickens and A Christmas Carol is a really good book. I got the book for a good price. I recommend the book and author. It is pretty easy to read on my iPhone 5. I bought it from Kindle app and it downloaded pretty fast.
