2,"Mis-information at best, or worse thinly veiled propaganda","Serge has unfortunately twisted facts to fit his message. This will hurt those readers who are unfamiliar with Islam, and accept Serge's work as authentic."
1,Hit Book,"If you are familiar with The Protocols of The Learned Elders of Zion or Henry Ford's The International Jew you will recognize the content and style of this book. This is a ""hit book,"" a book that compiles every defamation that has ever been uttered about Muhammad or Islam and puts them between two covers. If you like mindless hate and prejudice, you'll love this book.Not surprisingly this compilation of prejudice and ethnic hatred is published by an Orthodox Christian press. Got to admire those Christians and their G_d of Love and forgiveness."
1,"If possible, I would have given this book less than 1 star","It is not a surprise to read Srdja Trifkovic's racist and bias lies about Islam. Trifkovic's views are about as well documented as is his hatred for the Muslim religion. This book is an obvious attempt to appeal to Americans who because of the political correctness in this society don't reveal their true prejudice of Arabs and Muslims and are happy when someone else does it for them. The only people who can benefit from this reading are those who already hate Islam but afraid to labeled ""racist"" and therefore relish in Trifkovic's words of hatred. I recommend anyone who does not already hate Islam and Arabs and would like to learn more about the religion read Edward Said's ""Covering Islam"" or Said Aburish's ""A Brutal Friendship""."
5,The truth about Islam,A great book that cogently summarizes all that is wrong with the Islamic religion and the very real dangers that it poses to western culture in particular but global civilization in general.Prescient too as nearly a decade has passed since the book hit the shelves and what we are witnessing in Europe is but a very bitter taste of things to come.This horrendous scourge that is Islam is nothing less than a plague upon the planet.
5,A most imortant book,"I can't overemphasize how important this book it.Most people in the USA are so pro-Palestinian that they are oblivious to the dangers of Islam.What they don't realize, is that after they are done with Israel, the militant Muslims will come after the infidels of the USA.The biggest secret is that Islam hates the USA.Read this book and see why."
5,Great Lowdown on Islam vs. Western Civilization,"This book is a fantastic introspective piece examining the impact of Islam on Western Civilization. Any person who desires the skinny on disturbing features of the Kuran (such as Mohammed's ultraviolent life and recurrent edicts to ""kill the Jew wherever you find him"") needs to read this book."
5,A stern expose on Islamic history,"This book is well written and researched, and is certainly not propaganda. The vitriolic condemnations of this book are motivated by a politically correct view of the world, ignoring or dismissing the long, and well documented assault of Islam to Christendom and other cultures in the east. It's easy to repeat the mantra of liberal apologists, whom say that Islam is a religion of tolerance and peace. The truth is not so, or at least not so clear cut. Indeed Islam started its spread with violence, and is unapologetic about its use. Jihad, for 14 centuries was militant term. The new, and politically correct definition of jihad is some type of self-introspection. If you disagree with the book, at least be honest. Christianity has been examined and critiqued in thorough fashion; unfortunately Islam can't stand up to a similar scrutiny."
4,The Truth Hurts.,"one of the few books that accurately portrays - siting historical references Indian History under Islamic Rule. Better than the rubbish written by Indian pseudo Secularists denying the attrocities that were committed.The 'review' from L. F Sherman ""dikw"", Ishtiyaque Ahmad.... well the less said the better - consider the source. Indian History is not Mr Ahmad's strong suite.The book does have rightist leaning but the author cannot be faulted for his history and logic."
4,"Well researched, covers all the bases","Trifkovic's work is an excellent overview of many issues regarding Islam. Especially important are sections covering brief histories of various regions that don't normally receive much attention, such as Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, and others. He reports 14 centuries worth of massacres of Christian, Jew, and other non-Muslim populations in depressing detail, but his thorough research indicates truthfulness we will never see in the mainstream media. It is in a rather academic writing style, so some readers will need to keep a dictionary handy, but it is well worth the effort."
3,Not Enough Color,"I purchased volume II of this publication and there are only 4 pages (front & back) in color. Many of the black & white photos are like looking at bad Xerox copies. I think I'll find it very hard to identify patterns from many of these small photos. Otherwise, well-laid out and organized."
2,Not Worth Watching Even If It Came On T.V!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought this might be a pretty good straight to DVD action movie but I was wrong! I mainly watched it because of Bas Rutten(UFC Champion,BlackBelt Magazine ranks him as the world's greatest martial artist) He didn't show up until the last showdown match of the movie and didn't say a word,but he did fight well. This is a movie you just fast forward a lot until you get to a fight scene, which was okay if you like wire work (I don't really look for an oscar type of performance in an action movie but the acting in this movie was Terrible!) Do yourself a favour rent ""Belly of the Beast"" by Steven Seagal I'm sure you won't be pushing that forward!"
1,store123 is the worst,"I ordered a Jean Paul Gaultier from this store and It sent me another version totally diferent to the version ordered, the version sent is a summer version, I made a complain to the store and they said me that the product is a new one and it was totally original, but the problem is that I ordered that one showed in the picture a Eau De Toilette and they sent me a product that has a lot of water, alchool and nothing of perfume. If someone wants to buy from this store think about it first. I don't recomend neither the store nor the product"
5,Best parfum ever,Strong and sweet. My mom makes me buy one of this a year. We use a lot of this parfum to go out at night. Its one of the best ever.(not for daily use)
4,"Sexy, long lasting fragrance","Believe it or not I like Classique EDP layered with a very small amount of Dolce & Gabbana pour Femme lotion! Yummy. I haven't looked up the actual notes to this EDP, but to me it smells like victorian rose, amber, orchids, vanilla, and maybe carnations on a sandalwood base.?! It definiately has a warm, slightly sweet and very slightly powdery base. It is what I would call an intimately sexy scent.It lies close to the skin and smells great on fabric. The lasting power is just incredible. Classique EDP lasts well over 11 hours on my skin. When I wear Classique I cannot stop smelling my wrists!I think nearly every age group could pull Classique off. Tho, I'd imagine Classique on one helluva sexy granny!You might like Classique if you like Guerlain Samsara, VW Boudoir, BS Fantasy, CK Euphoria, Dolce & Gabbana for Women, EL Beautiful, Versace Crystal Noir, or Creed's Jasmine Imp. Eugenie, as these are some of the scents Classique reminds me of & I also enjoy."
2,I like the one on the picture add,"I order this product thinking that I will be getting the same one on the picture. I have one got it as a gift from a friend its already empty and I really really like the smell thats why I order a new one.I got dissapointed when I recieved a different kind of Jean Paul Gaultier pink bottle and pink liquid not the same kind on the picture. They deliver very fast which is very good, the only thing is pls dont use a different picture in your add then send a costumer a differend kind but same brand."
5,Favorite perfume ever,"Love, Love, Love this scent. Have worn it for about 15 years now and even tho I try others from time to time, keep coming back to this one. It is nice to layer it with the lotion, and eau de toilette, and it lasts all day. I have never found a better price than the one on Amazon. I never buy from department stores any more, as it costs about $20 more."
2,Imitation,The scent of the perfume received was mild and is definitely an imitation of the product. I have another bottle to compare with and it was not the same at all. Very disappointed.
4,Smells very expensive and looks it too.,"If you want a perfume that doesn't smell cheap or like body splash then this is the one. This perfume smells like it was made for royalty. My father bought this for me at full price $95, and it was worth every dollar to me. I didn't give this four stars because it can be too strong at times so if you are not feeling in a good mood or you're having a headache, it's best to use something lighter. This is a rich, strong but womanly scent. This is not a little girl's perfume, this is women's perfume. My friend's love this scent. They always say how I smell like a superstar. It just gives you that rich woman air and feel. Trust me, this is one for sophisticated ladies only."
2,smelled off and thier was glue on the bottle and top,"I loved the perfume in the dept. store but for some reason it smelled off, straight away right out of the bottle. The EDT did not smell like the origianl at the department store. I will try to give this away to some one as it is a none returnable item.. As well as the bottle had glue on the top and on the bottle, very dissapointed."
4,a floral fragrance with a difference,"A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid. Base notes include mere hints of vanilla, sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions."
1,"Enojada por el producto, vino a mitad de la botella","Good morning, I am writing from Venezuela. Buy perfume Jean Paul, which came half. poorly packaged wine and poured almost the entire remaining product in half, which upset me a little. My English is written with Google translator because they do not speak English. Excuse me. Sincerely Aurea Rosas. I need to know how to do to fix this problem. Thank you very much ...Note: It is in very bad taste to buy a product at that price and come in the middle of the bottle hope to respond to these words. Thank you."
2,tobacco musk aroma,"Bought this as a Xmas gift for my wife. She had bought the men's version for me this past summer...which she absolutely loved. Was told the fragrance was similar. However; upon receiving, and trying.. , easily determined that it was not even close. Strange strong fragrance that seems to lean more toward stale cigar /tobacco odor as the dominant aroma. Cant return so both of us are extremely dissapointed."
4,Research that stands the test of time,"Although Charles Kelly did not leave us with a lot of footnotes while in the course of writing this book, his research has stood the test of time, and relatively few of his facts are contested, even after more than fifty years. He was able to interview many of the old timers, participants and eye-witnesses, and come closer to capturing the feel of the time period. No wonder the book is full of intrigue and insight that the best modern researchers can not match."
3,Gems Scattered Along the Trail,"A convoluted, yet fascinating history of rustlers and robbers in Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, at the end of the 19th century to early 20th century. Kelly knows the history of the outlaws that were a part of the fabric of the Wild West community and he is full of interesting tales of men and women who survived, and sometimes thrived, under very harsh conditions. The most interesting part of the book is interviews done in the 1930's with those that lived in Brown's Hole and Hole-in-the-Wall. Though the book does not flow well chronologically, it is worth putting the pieces together to come up with a mosaic of what times must have been like for those on the opposite side of the law."
3,My review,"This is a good playing item for kids, but as the lenght of the cord is very less, it is not very confortable for my kid to play with"
3,good manufacturing quality,"the manufacturing quality is good. but when my baby dial it, not music, no voice. She likes real phone much more than this."
2,Cord is too short!,"The cord between the receiver and the set is way too short! And the eyes only move when u move the toy backwards, not forward. What a waste of money!"
2,Pull string and phone cord too short,This toy was kinda frustrating for my 17 month old. The phone cord was too short and the pull string was short as well. Maybe the pull string needs to be made of a thicker rope as opposed to the thin rope. She did like the rotary style dialing.
4,Fisher-Price Toddlerz Chatter Telephone,"This phone is so cute, (1) problem is the string is too short even for a much yourger child. I bought this for my, then 1 1/2 yr old, and yes she loves it. However, when she did use it and would pick up the receiver the entire phone would be pulled up too. The string is just to short, other than that its adorable."
3,"Classic toy, but one complaint.","Cute, classic toy, but my one complaint is that the cord connecting the phone to the receiver is way too short. Even my 1 yr old can't pick up the receiver and hold it to his ear without having to pick up the whole toy. The cord is only ~6 in long...probably that way to prevent entanglement, but it then it impedes the functionality of the toy."
1,Very little value,"With all the neat play phones on the market, this toy could only hold the interest of the 1 year old crowd, if that. And you can't even drag it around like when I was a child, because for safety, the strings are too short."
3,An old favorite. (been updated a bit),"This is an old favorite toy that I think every child has probably owned at one time or another.I look for toys that are fun, easy to use and fairly quiet. I also look for toys that encourage creativity, exploration of the world (educational is just a bonus). I want a toy that will grow with the child. This toy fits just about all of these requirements.This toy is fun for my kids to drag around. The moving eyes enchanted my son, encouraging him to walk when he first began walking. It is quiet and lots of fun.Here are my few comments- First, it would be more fun if the wheels clicked or made some noise. Second, The button pad is one big pad that pushes down all at once, this is a shame because it would be MUCH more fun if it had seperate number buttons.There are a lot of toys with strings for pulling. I bought this because I remembered mine. However, I don't think I would buy it for anything other than sentimental reasons. There are other more fun toys available."
4,An enduring favorite from my own childhood.,It is so wonderful to see a childhood favorite of mine now being enjoyed by my own child. It is a toy modeled from everyday life that a child can use to play grown-up. A phone of their own to call friends and family whenever they want. Always and forever a favorite.
3,Cute but not so much fun,"We as children had this same toy but now it's changed. Not as much fun I don't think as our grandchildren seem to leave it set aside while playing with the more up to date toys.I thought it was a good idea to buy, being reminded of my own childhood...but regret the purchase now.Don't really recommend."
4,Toddler toy,I bought this for my 8 month old. She loves holding it as though she's talking. I know that she will be able to play with this toy for quite awhile.
3,Memories,I remember having one of these when I was little. Cute!The only thing I dont like it the string that attaches the phone to the hand held part is super short.
1,Be Prepared To Be Scared Silly!,"Sure this phone is a very cute little phone. It has pretty colors, and kept my young child busy for a couple of hours. Lets get down to the real business folks...this phone rang off its hook about a month into owning it. As strange as this may seem...it scared us silly at night for a week straight! I literally threw it against a wall on the 3rd night, but that didn't stop it from ringing the following night. (This is why I gave this toy 5 stars in the durability section.) I would not recommend purchasing this toy for yourself, but perhaps for someone you wish to scare the silly out of!"
4,I just love it!,"I am currently doing my pre-Christmas shopping list for my 5 month old son Robert. He's already grabbing at the phone when I am talking on it, so I knew that a toy phone would be perfect come Christmas time. I was disapointed to find all of the jazzy new cell type play phones when I did my origional search. But I guess it's just a sign of the times. I was so happy to fine the origional with his rolly polly eyes. I remember calling up all of my childhood friends on mine. I just know that Robert will love this."
2,You're kid won't be fooled.,The phone cord on this toy is ridiculously short. I understand a long cord may be a hazard but my 14 month old can't even lift it to her ear without picking the whole thing up. Don't waste your money.
3,"A ""Classic"" That Should Probably Be Retired","I'm 34 now, and had a version of this toy when I was a kid. It's a decent toy, but nothing special when compared to so many others out there. What I find funny though is that kids today have probably NEVER even seen a phone like this. May be time to update or phase out this toy."
2,Smaller than original,"Not only is it smaller than the original, the string holding the receiver to the phone is about 8"" so it's virtually I,possible to hold it to your ear. Plus the string to pull I had to put aLarge button on to pull as it kept falling between my grandsons fingers"
3,Not what I expected,"Ok so when I first saw this phone on amazon it was a picture of the chatter phone with buttons, not the spin dial thing. So I decided to order it. When it was delivered I opened it immediately and saw that it had the spin dial. I took it to my house and let my niece play with it, it's her xmas gift, and she looked at it picked it up handed it to me rolled her eyes and walked away. I guess I have to get her somethin else because she definitely won't play with this. Other than that, it was delivered the day after I placed my order so super fast delivery"
3,it's okay,"I ordered the toy for my 1 year old DD because of the movie I saw it in. The cord for the phone handle is so short that even a baby needs to bend down or put her head very near the toy just so she could put the handle against her ear. It would have been so much better with a longer handle. I'm thinking of cutting and attaching a longer cord so it would be easier to play with. The dialer makes a ringing sound when you dial it and the eyes move up and down when the phone is pulled. Overall, pretty good IF the cord handle was longer."
2,Cord is too short,"I agree with previous reviewers - the cord on the phone is very short (probably 3 or 4 inches long) so that when the child puts the phone to their ear, they have to lift the entire phone.It's cute to look at but not exactly functional or purposeful."
1,Kind of a Clunker,The dilemma with this phone is that the cord that attaches the handset to the phone is only about 6 inches long. In order to answer the phone/lift the handset you have to pick-up the entire phone and move it very close to your face.I can guess that the cord is short for safety reasons. And I applaud that. But it negates the enjoyment of the toy.
1,CHILD CAN CHOKE WITH STRING,I thought this was a great toy until I seen my almost 2yr old wrap the entire string around her little neck. I was worried about her harming herself and took it away. She can play with when she is old enough to understand the phone goes to your ear and not around your neck.
3,what happened to the telephone cord?,"The cord that connects the receiver to the phone is ridiculously short! Really? How can you play telephone when the phone is literally hanging from you ear?Stupid new design! Figures, somebody thought it was unsafe.. typical U.S. worrysome bothers.Not a problem when I grew up."
3,My son likes it,"My son got this as a gift for his first birthday, and he likes it a lot. Carries it all over the place with him. In that respect, it's great. In other respects, it leaves a bit to be desired. First off, it comes with a LONG string to pull it around by - this of course is hazardous, everything I've ever read says not to give baby anything longer than 6"". So between that and a cat that eats string, the first thing I did was cut the string off. After how long the pull string is, the string between the base and handset is only a few inches - no where near long enough for it to be on the floor, and my son to hold the handset to his ear. Next, does anyone have a rotary phone anymore? ""I"" barely remember them from my childhood! I was sort of surprised to see that it wasn't a touch-tone phone, and then each button could have said the number or something. But, in the end, my son loves it, so I guess that's the important part (now that it's been made safe)."
3,"I had the ""classic"" toy... safety changes make it a bit disappointing.","A family friend suggested getting our 14-month old daughter a ""pull toy"" for Christmas. When I stumbled upon this, I thought I had the perfect gift. But when we actually opened it on Christmas day, I realized that there had been some changes, likely in the name of safety. The phone cord is now so short that you have to pick up both the phone and the handset to be able to hold it to your ear. I'm sure they did it because it was a strangulation risk, but it kind of makes the toy difficult to use. I wish I had gotten her a toy cell phone instead."
5,She calls daddy on this phone,My granddaughter spends hours playing with this toy. She calls her daddy on this phone. Definite must for the price.
4,A classic toy,"I bought this at a local clsoeout store chain in the NYC/Northern NJ area, which allowed me to get it for $4.99. Fisher Price, even their lower end toys, can usually be counted on for durability. The main reason to purchase this was I had the earlier model when I was a child in the 1970s. I loved it and I thought my son would too. Of course the one I had was wood or something stronger than the plastic model of today.Be careful with the cord. I'm assuming it is long for older kids who are walking already.While we don't have rotary phones today, it is still fun for pretend play. The kids will alos excercise their finger dexterity by dialing.I recommend the toy, even at $10, but I'm sure glad I paid half."
5,A good old toy!!!! Thank GOD there are still a few left.,"Got this toy for my grandson who loves phones. Was beyond excited that it still existed as his mom had one when she was little. It's nice to see a toy that isn't ""high tech"" or ""super educational""....just a good old fashion toy that lets him use his imagination, learn hands on by doing and doesn't require batteries, etc etc. Think kids now adays don't get enough of that....everything is high tech and no chance for them to just plain be kids."
4,Rise of Prussia,This book relates the story of Prussia's rise as an European power during the first eight decades of the 18th century. The period basically covered the history of the Prussia of Frederick the Great and his father. But the core history lies around Frederick the Great who used the army created by his father to turn Prussia from one of many German states into an European power.The book proves to be well researched and its very readable. Good thing about this book is that it won't cluttered you up with excess information. I thought it would serves as an excellent introductionary book to anyone who may be interested in reading up on Prussian history. (Not to be confused with recent Christopher Duffey's Prussia's Glory book.)
5,Great!,Despite the SIDS risk this is a cute addition to the nursery until the kids can turn over then take it out of the crib!
5,Love this bumper!,"I love this bumper. The embroidered animals are plush and very cute. Colorful too. Just about any color in the set you can use to paint/decorate the rest of your nursery with. I just wish the inside of this bumper also had the patchwork/animal design on it. Instead it is just plain blue--like the trim on the outside. So, when you walk into the room and look into the crib, what you will see is basically a blue bumper. Other than that, its a nice bumper--the set is great!"
2,Doesnt fit on our crib,The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby's crib...until I put it on...no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib (it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full-size) it fit very akwardly and never quite right. There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib. I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts.
5,his voice sounds excellent live,the volume of songs he performed was more than adequate. the medley of songs was especially good also. frequent changing of outfits made it more visually interesting. his voice sounded of excellent quality when performing live.
2,He Gets Points for Originality,"Don't recommend. The author has a great premise and does some good work here and there. Other than that, it is a dull read and it seems like the author mixed some romance novel descriptions of some of the characters. He wasn't familiar enough with Bundy, because he made Bundy do things he WOULD NEVER have done in real life. Any reader of true crime/Bundy will instantly be bored with the long drawn out character buildups. Bundy lurks around in the background for awhile, but not enough story around how he got out of jail what he's thinking, his behavior, etc."
4,Great read about a killer lout!,"Despite the press hype, Ted Bundy was a lout. A chronic failed student and loser with girls whenever he seriously tried. As one surprisingly honest reporter put it, ""He was not very intelligent, nor was he either well travelled or well read. He picked his nose during the interviews."" So much for Ted Bundy in real time. Writing a 420 pg novel with a cockaroach running amok as the main character was certainly a challenge, but Michael Perry fufilled it very well. In doing so, he helps bring us all back to the reality of how squalid such serial killers as Bundy & Co. are."
1,Very Disappointed...,I too purchased this product in hopes of using the handle. First time I pulled on the handle it popped off. My lid corners have also popped loose so the corner flaps now hang out in the open. I am very disappointed with this product. I too was surprised by the lid being attached in the back but again not a major issue just would have liked to know beforehand. Do not buy this box if you want to be able to touch it without is falling apart...
5,You can't go wrong with Echart Tolle,"I have yet to find a bad book or lecture with Eckhart Tolle, if we all could practice being in the now this would be a much better place to live."
5,perspective,"Eckhart has a way to put my/our daily thought ramblings in a perspective as to where I come to see another way of going about things. Why worry, why want to control what does not need to, why judge. Let it be. Less complicated life, with more time for joy and lightness."
5,Watch these,I'm a big Tolle fan and these DVDs didn't disappoint. They run for a combined 3.5 hours and hold your attention the whole time. Highly recommended.
4,Personal wipes,"I bought this product; because it is the most cost-efficient way to buy personal wipes which suit my needs. Though the wipes tend to feel a bit sticky when wet, treated skin dries cleanly without any residual tackiness. And, though these wipes do not claim to be hypoallergenic, I have seen no development of rashes or itching on treated skin. These wipes have a very faint clean, pleasant fragrance; despite claiming to be unscented."
1,Didn't received the merchandise,"After waiting about 4 weeks (my order was kept put on backorder), I cancelled the order."
4,Too much of what you'd expect,"A touching portrait of a dying man's wish to impart to others those things in life we would be better to focus on. Although there is no denying the essence of what Morrie has to say, I do believe the age of the reader will greatly influence the degree to which this book will be of significance.I also found the author's tendency to repeatedly describe the various physical problems overly detailed, although some will find Morrie's candor humorous.The subject matter alone makes for a poignant read, though, and the style is such that it doesn't get overly maudlin. I would especially recommend it for younger readers who are still caught up in the pressures of making a career and trying to find out what it takes to be happy."
4,Death can't conquer all,This was a great story about a man who wouldn't let death ruin his life. He kept on living and teaching until it was his time. I loved all that he taught Mitch. Those were things we all needed to hear.Great book! Cannot wait to pass it on to friends!!
1,The book fails to deliver,"I am sure both the teacher(Morrie) and the author are great people. However, the author fails to effectively describe why Morrie was such a great person other than the fact that the author says so. He also fails to convince the reader as to why the author was so much liked by Morrie. The quotes from Morrie are usual cliches. May be author learned alot from Morrie since he was busy making money in the past, but certainly, there was nothing refreshing for me in this book."
2,There are better books out there,"I found this to be rather trite. Many of the ""teachings"" are little more than regurgitated platitudes from the world religions (which in turn stole them from the original sources anyway) - anyone to whom these ""teachings"" are enlightening or revelatory must be a very sheltered, young or self-absorbed person. There is a much, much deeper level to explore in life, and correspondingly death; I would call this book perhaps a good ""beginner's"" guide, but for those seeking something more substantial I highly recommend ""The Pagan Book of Living and Dying"" by Starhawk. (Yes, even if you're not a pagan this book has a lot to offer). Blessed Be!"
2,A light- book to read while travelling,"What is said in this book could have been said in less words! Mitch Albom has not done a great job in explaining the thoughts of Morrie. Morrie sounds like a warm-hearted American teacher to me. I suggest Halil Cibran's ""The Prophet"". Yet, Tuesdays With Morrie is fun and easy to read."
2,Good but extremely overrated,"This is an interesting read, touching in places, especially in the end as Morrie nears his death. One does not, however, come away from the book especially enlightened. Frankly, I can't understand why all these other reviewers are thumping this book!!"
1,"A hackneyed, cliche tale","Mitch Albom has written a slim volume that has become nothing less than the ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" of the '90s -- a ""feel good"" book that you forget almost instantly after reading it.Just telling people that they should ""love or perish"" and that the single-minded pursuit of success is wrong, isn't compelling. It's rather like reading a book full of painfully obvious truths that somehow escaped the writer ... until now.Part of Morrie Schwartz's message is that Mitch Albom needed to live his life according to the ethics he espoused. How does Albom reconcile the fact that he didn't stay out on strike against the Detroit Free Press in 1995, but crossed the picket line to reclaim his six figure job, while others stayed out and lost homes and cars?As the Quakers say, it's the way you live your life, not your fancy words."
5,teachers...,"I have had teachers that treat me in the monor that Morrie Schwartz, treated mitch. I truelly loved this story. What makes it so much more real and touching is that the story is true. I think that it takes a lot to write a story or even make a movie of something this painful, death may happen all the time, but it still hurts. I think that this is a truely moving story of a teacher and student, and how they showed each other how you learn and teach with roles reversed.For someone who took sociology and liked it I think I would have liked morrie as my teacher. Mitch you are truley blessed to know this man. I give you 5 stars for this book!"
2,Too much hype maybe?,"I totally agree with ""Too simplistic"". I expected much more depth where there isn't much at all. I thought Morrie's lessons would be very profound yet his message was not profound at all. He sounds like he was truly a wonderful man and I admire the author's writing style but the book isn't life changing or deep in any way."
4,Tuesdays with Morrie:,I am really not much of a fiction reader but this was a good book... It keeps your attention and has a lot to teach you. You will end of doing a lot of self reflection.
5,Heartwarming Surprise,I have been wanting to read this book for many years and I just decided to buy it. It is wonderfully thought provoking and it lends a certain amount of joy that comes with knowing that we are all going to meet our maker someday; we should enjoy every moment that we can and above all tell those that you care about you love them as often as you can.
5,Astounding,"This book is an amazing story about life when one is near death, courage, and strength. Great book! A must read!"
4,Tuesdays with Morrie,"I read this book on Christmas day. What a lovely story of life lessons and the friendship between two men. It also rang very true in the description of the dibilitation of Lou Gerigs disease.I read hard core serious text like books everyday, this book added thought provoking warmth to my holiday."
5,simply serves its purpose to the max,"I fully enjoy this book. Will give it 5 stars without hesitation, any time. Just a few words for those other readers that couldn't appreciate the book either because of the level of English the author used or its content. First, common sense, this is a book intended to reach as many people as possible. What good does it do to have it written that we have to look up the dictionary on every other word? Second, these readers must be very lucky in life up to this point. I haven't been. It is a totally different story when you find out you are dying. Your life can turn completely upside down within seconds, and often you can do nothing to reverse it. It is not joking material nor much fun. So, please, these readers,give the book more deeper thoughts, and you should find it very helpful in your life, sooner or later. And very important, be thankful to Morrie."
4,"Not only did I cry, I learned some of lifes greatest lessons",Tuesdays with Morrie is a very moving book w/ wonderful one liners. Read it and enjoy!
1,cheap sentimentality,"The emotions described here have all the weight and sincerity of drugstore greeting cards. The author is a TV sportswriter and it shows. I believe that the author had some genuine affection and devotion for Morrie, but he has not successfully captured that here. Instead, his prose comes across as shallow, manipulative and insincere. If I were the author, I'd take a year off and go live by myself in a remote cabin and re-write this book, ripping each word from my heart. This book here is just too facile, too TV-esque. The only thing that the author seems truly heartfuelt about is the awe in which he holds Ted Koppel and the Nightline program."
1,Sham Spirituality!,"Always read the full book before you criticize! So, I suffered through this book even though, mercifully, it is a short one. Our lives are so empty, so bereft of meaning - that we will make a bestseller of even the most inane, most mediocre self-help book. Life is not as simple as Morrie makes it out to be. If someone really cares, he would not cocoon himself with all material comforts and spend a fortune on medical expenses - when children are starving to death around the world. Morrie seems as selfish as anyone else - he wants what he wants and wraps his wants with Hallmark philosophy. Meanwhile the Earth is getting destroyed through global warming, millions are dying unnecessarily everywhere and economies and countries are going bust making billions jobless...if you want true spirituality, go to the source - read the Bible, the Koran, the Gita.... Better still, go help someone who desperately needs helpSrinivas Anumolu"
2,Not all varieties of als are equal. I give the book 2 just because of o.w.,"I'm sure somewhere in these 2000+ reviews it is mentioned that not all varieties of als work the same. People with the bulbar type tend to lose the ability to speak and swallow first. Their life expectancy is shorter from diagnosis to death. A Wednesday with Donna is going to be more about reading than listening. But, she writes well and with a good hand. So far."
2,Uber Sappy,"It may be because i am very cinical, but i found the book to be very sappy. Morrie disses every aspect of the capitalist society all in the name of ""love"". I don't recomend reading it, unless you have to like i did for school."
2,Overrated,"A warm and sensitive portrayal of the relationship between two men but grossly overrated. A simplified view of complex issues. Not bad if you have a few extra minutes, like Bridges of Madison County or Love Story. OK for a nonreader. If you are literate, save your money. Check it out of the library."
2,I was so disappointed . . . .,"After hearing so many people call this a ""must read,"" I was so disappointed. I found none of the great insights advertised or even simple truths. Rather, it was trite sentimentalism, page after page."
4,"""Don't waste your life - be optimistic and live meaningfully","This is the message I get from this book. Short story, pretty powerful considering this is a true story (although I think the author could have thrown in more passion or written it more touchingly). Or maybe the genuity is what makes the book so well received, and of course I have nothing against a true and down-to-earth story over a dramatic tear-jerking story.The message conveyed in the book is all positive - and I believe it's both soothing to people who are facing difficulties in life and encouraging to people who are lost in life and would propel them to establish new goals.Last but not least, I highly recommend another more 'practical' book with similarly positive and stronger effects (and of course a longer read) - ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Stephen Covey."
2,Vastly Overated,"Spiritual advice at the elementary school level--one of the most over-rated books of all time. But, a good start for for your children."
5,Dying with dignity...,"Morrie shows us all that a little human compassion goes a long way. It shows how he keeps a sense of humor through despite the odds being stacked against him. It has taught me how to cope with my own mother dying from this deabilitating and deadly disease, and how she has remained so strong throughout her own ordeal. He has been an inspiration for my own mother to model. It shows a real perspective on dying and how to prepare for something you never think can happen to you."
4,"The appeal and depth, ironically, is in its simplicity.","I'm still trying to decide if this book either (1) fell short in conveying the ""large lessons"" in life or if (2) it succeeded in telling a very simple story with the simplest of lessons, leaving it to the reader to find insight in applying it to one's own life. Initially, it left me wanting more and I felt the author could've better done this wise man (Morrie) justice in the telling of this story. However, as days have passed since putting down this short story, I am finding the appeal and insights of the book are actually in its simplicity."
5,BEST BOOK!!!,"In the book Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom, the main character, Mitch, learns many lessons from his old college professor, Morrie Schwartz. Morrie and Mitch meet together every Tuesday and talk about a different topic. Some of the topics are: family, marriage, culture, and money. All of these topics revolve around a center topic that is the main lesson learned from the book. This lesson is appreciation. When Morrie and Mitch were first meeting together, Mitch did not appreciate very must at all and he neglected important relationships including his friendship with his brother. But when Morrie was diagnosed with ALS, Mitch's life changed. He finally started to appreciate everything in his life. This book tells the story of Mitch and Morrie's life together."
2,Interesting,"ALthough the seriousness of the disease is obvious in the book, I think was rather simplistic"
3,"WISE, INSPIRATIONAL AND DISAPPOINTING...","I am a psychoanalyst and one of my patients gave the book to me, strongly urging me to read it. Since it would facilitate the therapy, I read it, in a two hour gulp. My guess is that to my patient, I am Morrie and he is Mitch. He is in business and driven to success and I urge him to slow down and smell the roses. He has a thing about unconditional love and tough love. The former is an ideal, the latter, real. The trouble with Mitch and Morrie is that Mitch painted a saint, not a real, believable person. I suppose we all need ego-ideals, but we already have them in Ghandi, King, Mandela and Mother Theresa. Sure, we should all love each other and smell the roses. Cynically, I am sure that Mitch cried all the way to the bank. So did Ted Koppel."
2,I GOT LITTLE OR NOTHING OUT OF IT,"For ALBOM, this was a tragic experience. But, wasit a book??? Well, I don't think so. Luckily, it only tooka couple of hours to read. I really got zippo from readingit. Again, the rating system is lacking some leeway. Thisbook is not a two, but, it is not a one either. There are nohalf-stars!!!"
3,A simple read over a very complex subject,"Tuesdays with Morrie is a very simple read, by that I mean the story line is very general in its morals even though it is about a complex, deep and sensitive matter. I thought before I bought it, the book would show more principles and wisdoms but it was very simple in its knowledge. This does not take anything away from Mitch Albom whose writing style gives a very easy and smooth read. It may help some to understand and overcome their similar positions or help others with similar positions. It is a story of struggles in facing death whilst reflecting on life. It looks at life and death as a two way mirror as a moral compass but shows you it may be too late to do this when you are old. The book may help some to start young in being wise and doing good when alive so the after life is good too."
1,Yet another cliche.,"Another typical attempt to solve life through some giant inspirational cliche. No more novel or fresh in its content than any one of hundreds of ""guide me through life"" antecdotes created by robots. Save your time and money for something more substantial."
1,Pap and bathos from a hack sportswriter,"Albom, a hack sportswriter with a tired vocabulary and an inability to string together sentences longer than three or four words, has finally managed something superlative: He has composed the most awful, bathos-ridden piece of tripe published in the last 20 years.No doubt Morrie was a man worth remembering if he could inspire even someone as unimaginative as Albom. But to have your memory trivialized by such a hack must have him spinning in his grave. But Albom knows his market, and he knows there's a never ending demand among the insecure for shallow, overly sentimental books that pull on the heartstrings, and he's delivered just that. The sales numbers certainly support that.If you need inspiration, there are better books, and not all of them are written at the fourth grade level."
3,Admit to the problem?,"Similiar to all of the self-help books (or any 12 step program!), the impact and benefit of this book relies on the reader's mind-set, not the author's. I approached Tuesdays with Morrie in a welcoming tone and was not disappointed. This book is not meant to engender great feelings for Morrie but instead lead the reader through his or her own mentors. I did not grieve for Morrie but I did find a safe environment to say goodbye to my own family and friends who have departed and to reminesce about my most influential ""teachers"" - some of whom were academics, collegues, friends, and mere acquaintences. This is a 5 star if you're receptive; a no-star if you're not."
5,I can only hope to achieve such an incredible grasp on life!,"After reading the front fold of this book, I immediately had to purchase it(and I hope that you will too)! I have a professor like Morrie, and reading this book only reinforced how lucky I am to know him! There are certain people in this world who really understand ""the meaning of life"" and really live to forfill that meaning. Morrie, and my professor, are two of those people! I hope to join them one day, but for now, I realize that I have so much more to learn!"
2,all about Mitch...,This book is more about Mitch's obsession with his annual income then it is Morrie.
2,Tuesdays to Avoid,"I READ THE BOOK BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN ON THE BEST SELLER LIST FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED TO ME. IN GENERAL, IT WAS A REAL DISAPOINTMENT! ALTHOUGH THE BOOK WAS TOUCHING AT TIMES, IT DID NOTHING BUT SKIM THE SURFACE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND HIS ""COACH."" EACH CHAPTER WAS SO SHORT THAT NO TOPIC WAS ADAQUATELY COVERED. I FELT LIKE I WAS READING THE OUTLINE OF A NOVEL ABOUT TO BE WRITTEN. I ALSO FELT THAT IT WAS SOMEWHAT INSENSITIVE TO THOSE LESS FINANCIALLY FORTUNATE TO READ ABOUT THESE TWO MEN'S DISCUSSIONS OF GIVING UP THE PERSUIT OF MATERIAL HAPPINESS. NEITHER WILL HAVE TO WORRY WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL WILL BE COMING FROM IF THEY GIVE IT UP. THE BOOK IS SHORT AND COULD BE READ IN A COUPLE OF HOURS SO DO SO IF ONLY TO KEEP UP WITH THE CULTURE."
1,Save some money and down a few dozen packets of Sweet-n-Low,"Oh, what drivel. I'm not sure which I resented more: Morrie's presumption that his impending death somehow imparted wisdom, or Ablom's prodigal son schtick. I'm sorry that Morrie suffered such a long, drawn-out illness, but that does not elevate trite sentimentalism to the realm of grand philosophy. Nor do I doubt Mitch's love for his teacher, or the sincerity of his motives- I just was exhausted by his bouts of self-recrimination interwoven with breathless awe for Morrie's wisdom.I must admit that I found myself compelled to finish the book. I kept hoping that somehow it would rise above the fortune cookie wisdom and deliver some real insight. Unfortunately, I was disappointed."
1,What?,"My girlfriend gave me this to read.I thought it was very bland. I started to read it, realized half way through that I was just staring at the pages and none of it was registering, so I put it down.I'm not sure what the point of the book was. The story is beyond boring. The author tries to convey life's lessons thru the eyes of a dying old man. Each chapter starts with some generic axiom like ""Learn to love"" then goes into a bunch of lifeless dialogue where the old man basically tells the author to ""Learn to love""There's nothing interesting or unique about this book.Don't waste your Tuesdays and pass on this book."
2,"If you only want to cry, read it.","This book is written to make you cry. I have read that it makes you reconsider your life, but in my opinion it is so a personal story that you can only reconsider the author's life, that you actually don't know."
1,"Overrated, Overhyped, Oversold","I guess this book's enormous popularity shows how eager & desperate people are for a little life-advice regardless of its depth (or lack of). The problem: this book just doesn't cut it. I had high expectations, but was left nonplussed. Touching in a few places, yes. But Morrie's revolutionary advice amounts to mundane items like, ""take time to smell the flowers,"" and ""tell your family that you love them."" Good advice? - sure. Worth 2 years on the NY Times bestseller list and 791 Amazon reviews crying ""Hallelujah!""? Not hardly."
2,Nothing New!,"Before I read it, I thought I would have got great ideas in it. However, after reading it, I was quite disappointed. Almost all the points or ideas inside the book have been said by the present Dalai Lama in his speeches, seminars, books, etc. Sometimes I doubt whether the author merely copied ideas from Buddhism!"
4,A great remembrance of growing up after college,I found the book to be very delightful. I picked it up and wasfinished reading it in less than two hours. I just couldn't put itdown. This book allowed me to think about my life and how I thought my life would turn out to be after college. A must have!!
5,The perfect book to take a pause and ponder the future,A fine example of a book that makes you take a pause and ponder the future and adjust accordingly
5,A must read!,"By far this is the most touching book I have ever read. If you read only one book this year, make it this one. It will move you to tears and make you think about what is truly important in life."
4,Makes you want to quit your job and become a philosopher.,"The author uses sensible flashbacks to explore the mind of his mentor, comparing the thoughts of his professor, with the thoughts of his elderly friend, 16 years later. Any former college student will identify with Alboms recounting of his experience with his college teacher and the way his idealism gave way to the reality of making a living. This is a very emotional story that causes tears most of the way through. The book can be read at one sitting and leaves you drained. I reccomend it for all ages, down to middle schoolers."
5,Superb!,"I have read this book many times. I have bought many copies for friends. I have read this book to myself many times. I have read this book to my people many times. And now I have realised that the more you read the more you understand what Morrie tried to communicate.For those who don't understand why this book is good, you may have re-read it many times"
5,Pass the Tissue Box,"As you can tell this is a very sad, but touching book about a special bond that can never be broken. I loved this book from the moment I read the first page, due to the format which it was written in. This special bond is that of a College professer and his student. It was my favorite book ever and I suggest you read it."
4,Lessons about life,"This is a good book, it can teach you many different lessons about life. As Mitch and Morrie grew older and apart, Mitch forgot about Morrie. Morrie always remembered Mitch as the bright young college student that he loved. Once he is diagnosed with ALS he life starts to change. Morrie loved to go dancing and ALS attacks your muscles making you have limtited mobility. When Mitch sees his college professor on T.V. he calls him and says he wants to come see him. Over the course of their visits Morrie teaches him lessons about his life. How it is ok to ask for help when you can no longer help yourself. To give up the man image of wanting to die after you can no longer help yourself. Finally not to be scared of death but to prepare for it."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a lot from this book, especially since many people have told me how much they loved it! It was pretty good, but I think I was expecting it to be much more like Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture - and it wasn't. Tuesdays with Morrie was touching, easy to read and interesting, but I was expecting more."
3,"Good reminders, but no new insights","Tuesdays with Morrie packages plain old common sense as new, deep spiritual insight. I don't think anyone doesn't already know that life is short, family and friends are more important than material possessions, etc, but it's still good to be reminded. Enjoy it for what it is: a simple story of a man facing death with a positive perspective."
2,Explicit details of illness and death totally unnecessary.,"After reading this book I was left depressed and unbelieving in Mitch's true dedication. Having seen my young mother's untimely death when, at the end, she insisted only her immediate family be with her. I cannot understand Morrie wanting the whole world to watch his body's sad decay when he could have been remembered by his lively eyes, dancing and profound wisdom. Yes, this is life but we all witness it in our own families and don't need reminders of ""big globs of phlegm"" coughed into a kleenex. Has Mitch now changed his life and given his efforts to community service and helping humanity? Am sure because this book was so highly rated, he will join the ranks of self healing books and another will be forthcoming."
2,Boring,"This story was pretty boring. While Morrie may be a wonderful friend to the author, there was nothing of any kind of insightful nature in the book. It wasn't terrible but I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
1,This is a very corny book apparently by a professional scribbler in search of,"something -- anything, really -- to scribble about. There's no wisdom, no ideas, not even good writing; it's crudely emotionalizing vapid tripe and nothing more. The only thing I felt was (assuming this Morrie guy was a real person) sorry for him to be used like that. Save your time."
2,Boring,"This book must be geared to the senior crowd. Only could should be found in a retirement home. There is no pace, the authour ambeles slowly thhrough the lifeless plot. Finished it only because I wantedto keep up wiith the Bestsellers list. But really, how did it sell so many copies? Is the whole book-buying world over 60?"
2,Disappointing,"So Morrie's wisdom is a bit schmaltzy. That I could put up with. It's Albom's insincerity that destroys his book. This comes out even more so on the audio-cassette version. One can almost envision him sitting at the edge of his dying mentors bed thinking, ""Oh boy, book project!"". What that leads to is the anthesis of the message. It's almost like Albom is writing in the third person...""I once knew this workaholic named Mitch who was reunited with his mentor, Morrie, where he learned all these insights about life...."". You could hear the publishing wheels turning in Albom's head throughout the pages. A disappointing book."
3,Short of Great Expectations,"Mitch Albom, a nationally syndicated sports writer for the Detroit Press, has a chance to visit his old mentor and college professor Morrie Schwartz while he is in the midst of dying. This book captures that experience.I had such expectations of this book due to the widespread attention and sales this book garnered that anything short of a life-altering experience would be a disappointment. I thought it would be a transcendent meditation on life, on dying, on the human spirit. It tries to be these things, but tends to fall short leaning towards the over-sentimental. It is a noble ideal to share with the rest of the world the wisdom gained from a cherished person. The author does so with honesty, but I find after reading this two years down the road, the observations, life lessons, philosophy, wisdom gained just hasn't stuck with me. I would look to other books for life-altering wisdom."
4,Life's Greatest Lesson,"I thought this book had a great story. The way it was put together kept you reading no matter how tired you were. You had to keep reading to see what happened next in the short time that Morrie had left. At the end it moved you to tears, not only because you knew the end was coming for Morrie, but because of the struggles he went through with his illness and the love he had for everyone and not just his family, but for all man kind!"
5,Loved It!!,"Inciteful, compassionate, profound. This is a book everyone should read and then pass along to someone they care about. Also makes a great gift!!"
4,A lesson taught,I though this this book taught me a valuable lesson. To live life and have no regrets. It taught me to listen and to be there for others as I would want them to be there for me. It is a great book to read if you want to understand the meaning of life.
5,Tuesdays with Morrie,"I ordered this book in November of 2007. We had lost a friend to ALS in October of 2006, and my friends father as diagnosed with ALS in November of 2007. This is a fantastic book, I couldn't put it down. I also readthe book 5 People you meet in Heaven, it really makes you think. Mitch Albom is a great writer. My heart goes out to anyone suffering from ALS, as it is a terrible disease."
5,A touching life lesson,Sometimes the most beautiful stories are the simplest. This book touches your heart and helps put life and what is truly important into perspective. A treasure to read over and over again.
2,lifetime movie material,"frankly, i have to say this book is sentimental drivel, if i even remember it. i read it (someone gave it to me as a gift, i think) and quickly forgot all about it. just the kind of feel-good, therapeutic prose that is the stuff of lifetime movies (it WAS made into a movie, didn't it?). save your money."
2,Overrated,"I think it's great that so many people have been touched by this book, but honestly, I found it simplistic and--perhaps less forgivable--boring."
1,"""Good-Bye Dear Friend""","I am enjoying reading this book on this very tender subject. Death and dying are subjects that are not readily talked about. This book is about the last days, weeks and months of two very close friends who together courageously talk about life and death as sequential events. It is a life guide so that when we do take our last breath, there are as few regrets as possible. I recommend people of all ages read this and understand the message."
4,wife liked it...did not love it,"another purchase for my wife. she is so smart and well read. what is she doing with a guy like me? she says she just liked it and did not love it...but hey, four of five stars is still worth buying if you are a reader right?"
4,my review on mitch's final report; tuesdays with Morrie,Before I entered college there was an assignment where we had to read two books over the summer. One of the books that I read was tuesdays with Morrie. I feel as though this was a very good book for college students to read. It helped me understand what I had to look forward to when I go into college. I thought this book made me think about my older relatives. Mitch spent a lot of time with Morrie through the days that he had left to live. Mitch learned a lot from Morrie not only by his teaching style but most importantly by his life lessons.
5,This was the best book I've ever read!,"After reading ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" I had a total different view of life. This book helped me to realize that I needed to look at life in a different aspect. It's about death, love and not revolving your life around material things. After reading this book it brought me closer to a lot of family I haven't talked to in awhile. My family and I have become much closer and I thank this book. I no longer look for the wrong in people, but instead let love flow. It makes one realize that death is not the end, but a learning experience. It makes one realize that love should break through any emotion no matter what has previously happened. This was the best book I have ever read in my life. It will help anyone see the good in life, instead of the bad."
5,A diet at my age,"Thanks, Morrie and Mitch, you give me diet at my age when I am thinking over the topics such as aging and death."
5,This book was so inspirational and emotional,"This was such a good book!! I have to admit, though, I watched some of the movie before I read the book, which I hate to do. I found out, though, that the movie is surprisingly accurate. I mean, while I was reading the book, pictures and parts of the movie would pop up in my head, and it was exactly like what I was reading. The book was well written, and it was pretty graphic, but I would really recommend that everyone watch the movie, because it is soo accurate, and it really helps to add to the seriousness of the disease, and the emotions the characters felt. So read the book first, and get pictures in your head of how you imagine it all happening, and then watch the movie. It's such a powerful story, and I just can't get over how accurate ever single detail and line is in the movie. The part about the wife was a little different in the movie, but everything else is just like the book. I would love to meet someone like Morrie when I go to college!!"
4,A caution,"This book is great if you're dealing with death in your family, or if you just happen to like the essay genre (like me), otherwise this book is a little dry for pleasure reading. The man was a college professor, after all, and this book reads somewhat like a lecture. If you can get past that, this book has some wonderful insights, not just on death but on how to live life as well. As Morrie himself might have said, ""Death isn't worth anything if you don't live well beforehand, and face it cheerfully."" This book shows you how. Excellent!!!"
3,A good little read,"It is a simple, yet powerful story. Not the best book I ever read, but definitly one I will read again."
2,Trite,"An old man bravely facing death tries to pass on meaningful advice to a younger disciple. Unfortunately, the old man, though courageous, is a preachy, pompous windbag, and the younger man is a self-absorbed twit of a hack sportswriter. Maybe it got a lot better toward the end; I quit a little more than halfway through."
3,"Uh, Mitch, what was it Morrie said about money?","Great book. Touchy-feely, well-done, etc. There was a fair amount in it about what's really important in life and money wasn't it. Mitch Albom has done a nice job of making plenty with the book. Not quite up there with pocketing door to door UNICEF collections but sort of has that same feel. It would have been really good to have ""100% of proceeds to whatever charity etc etc"" plastered all over the book. That way poor Morrie would have to keep rolling over and over and over as Mitch shopped for new cars and signed lucrative contracts."
4,Morrie - comfortable with himself,"""Tuesdays with Morrie"" is a unusual book.I enjoyed it when I read this book. I like Morrie. I respect him. He was a talented teacher, faithful and dedicated friend, a responsible loving caring father and husband. He had a light optimistic feeling of life. I like Mitch. I believe he will change his life, because he is young and he has time."
4,"SImply written, immense themes",This is a wonderful book about learning life's lessons. It is written simply to bring home the themes of the novel. It's a wonderful book to read and a very important one.
4,Tuesdays With Morrie,"Tuesdays With Morrie, sportswriter Mitch Albom introduced us to his beloved teacher Morrie Schwartz. Albom narrated his audio production with a heart that only a great bond can have."
4,Tuesdays With Morrie,"When you pair David Paymer and Nathan Lane as Felix and Oscar in the Odd Couple, you are in for a comic tour de force that over stretches its material. With a supporting cast which includes Dan Castellaneta and Yeardley Smith (both from The Simpsons) and Linda Purl, the cast is almost perfect. This production is a little too visual in a few of its jokes. However, on the whole, it unscrupulously grabs the audio listener by his ears and shakes him with laughter."
4,Tuesdays With Morrie,"I give the book Tuesdays With Morrie four stars. It was a very moving and compationate story. Morrie and Mitch's converstaions were very interesting. I loved Morrie's attitude. He was never upset or depressed about his condition. He just lived live to the fullest and did not waste one minute. he was also a very smart man. He had many theories that people shoudl live by to have a better life. I am interested in going into the medical field. As a medical professional, you have to deal with dying patients and their families every day. That is something I am going to have to get used to doing. The book Tuesdays With Morrie showed me how it is going to be. I believe there will be times where I might get emotionally attached, which is not good. This book opened my eyes to death. Everyone should read this book, especially if you are intersted in going into the medical field."
1,Insulting,"TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE could have been a great book. Instead, the author uses maudlin, hackneyed language to treat serious topics. There is no question, Morrie is a man of incredible wisdom with great life teachings to give, but Mr. Albom shamelessly panders to an audience with a tear-jerk fetish, corrupting the wisdom of an honest dying man with the language of a man enmeshed in the world of capitalism. Insultingly enough, it is entirely clear through Mr. Albom's language and writing style that he is intending for the reader to cry. One thing is clear: either Mr. Albom used this tragic story to make a lot of money, or he has unwittingly and foolishly ventured into a writing genre in which he does not belong."
5,One of the top ten books I have ever read,"The book makes you laugh, cry, think and reflect. If you open youself up it will make a positive impact on the way you live your life."
4,Compelling Mirror on Middle Age,"This was an interested book that for me was as the title tag line says about ""...An Old Man, a Young Man..."" As a man approaching middle age, the author's reactions and feelings as he responded to Morrie's strong life spirit even in dying rang true. What I didn't get, was any deep sense of where the author went with new perpectives on life the Morrie brought about in him. Clearly, he was touched, but what did he change in his life?. Maybe in his next book..."
5,There's power in simplicity.,"I was deeply moved when I read ""tuesdays with Morrie"". Beautiful thoughts, simple prose, full of insights about life and death. It's really a book for the living, not about the dead. It's a parting shot at all of us who think being Number One is the only thing in life. Come to think of it, what's really wrong in being Number 2? Good read."
5,Great book with great advice,"As mentors are becoming rare these days, this book is very valuable--we can learn a lot by reading it. Many key subjects regarding life are discussed and peppered with pearls of wisdom throughout make this book a treasure and a valuable read. Another book that I enjoyed and offers many gems of wisdom about key issues of life, and it's like sitting down with a good old friend for an intimate chat, is Dietmar Scherf's ""I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression"" which I also bought at Amazon.com"
4,A true warm story about mentors,"This book somewhat resembles a diary. A young man visits his old dying teacher, and learns more about life than he bargains for. It is one of those books, that can be a catalyst for a life-changing experience for a reader. At the very least it can wake you from the doldrums of life and encourage you to take a long hard look at yourself, and examine where you are personally heading along lifes treadmill.With 191 pages, and the lines well spaced out, it is easy to get into and doesn't take very long to read. Highly recommended."
2,"5 stars for Morrie, 0 for Mitch; so averages at 2.5 stars","This book would have been so much better if it was an autobiography! I loved Morrie, but I found Mitch very annoying. He is a workaholic, and I am not, so I had absolutely nothing in common with him. But give me Morrie's wisdom anyday! He tells a great proverb about waves and the ocean that I will never forget. My only guess as to why everyone loves this entire book is that they also fell in love with Morrie; I just hope they were not equally enamored of Mitch. Shallow city. But at least it is a short book so I didn't have to endure him for very long. I am glad I read it, but this book did not live up to all of the hype. I approach any book that is touted as a must read by so many people as one that reaches the lowest common denominator in our society, and that is not a good thing. Read it because Morrie is a gem, not because everyone is telling you to read it."
5,Do yourself a favor,"It takes two hours, at the most three, to read this book. Do yourself a favor, read it. As an adult, midway through my life, if i could choose only one book to read for the rest of my life, this would certainly be it. It is inspiring, sad, hopeful, intelligent, tradgic, and funny all at once.Read this book- you wont regret it, in fact, you'll thank me."
4,A memoir and a eulogy full of wisdom,"I feel ashamed that when I received this book as a Father's Day gift I thought, ""Yeah, whatever, another Oprah's book of the month, new age weepy spouting inane little philosophy of life aphorisms."" Sure, there are plenty of little life aphorisms here but there is also a lot of real wisdom. Read in one setting, it left me in tears and on both counts that's a rare thing."
4,Deeply Moving Reminder,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. Kudos to the author for being strong enough to endure and record the final season of the life of his ""Coach"". It was nice to have been introduced to Morrie. I already recognize the importance of legacy and that we should stop and smell the flowers before we die, but if ever I can't verbally relate this message to someone else...I will recommend this book as a priority for them to read.The Tuesday conversational topics included: The world, feeling sorry for self, regrets, death, family, emotions, fear of aging, money, love goes on, marriage, culture, forgiveness, the perfect day, saying good-bye.An excellent tribute!"
2,Not for everyone.....,"I'm sure you've read many reviews on how touching this book is, and I would say 'to each their own'. But an entire book written about a death-bed conversation can be a bit much for some people. Think of the scene in 'The Empire Strikes Back' when Yoda is dying and speaking his last words to Luke... well now imagine that scene was the content of the entire movie and you get a sense of what it was like to read this book. The first half was touching... Morrie - an old college professor was dying, passing on his words of wisdom to his dear ex-student. Well, by the second half of the book, I just wanted him to pass away so I can finish the book and start another. I'm sorry, some may say this is blasphemy, but how many tear-jerking eye opening last words of wisdom can you really absorb? And to be honest, I can hardly remember what they were after I closed the book."
4,One more lesson to learn,"What else can be said following so many reviews that hasn't been said.For me, the biggest lesson of all was what I ask people in classes and meetings and other gatherings. That question, is what do you want to be remembered for?I guess there are many other questions like what have you learned thus far in life, what would you pass on to others, what really matters, what would you do differently, what do you hope to still do. Mitch lets us see Morrie in so many ways, the way he is, the way he was as well as the way Mitch sees him and the way Morrie sees himself.It's a rather quick read, but lessons will last years longer."
5,A heartfelt life guidance!,"I read this book in the subway on the way to office and back to home, which means I spent about 40 minutes a day. I realized that I was enjoying the extra time which I just wasted out normally. It took a week for the completion of reading.Actually this book came to me by change, and I was reluctant to read it. However, as the reading was going on, I love this book which gave me a chance to re-think about my life and what is important in my life. Some people, stuck in making money only, should read this book and have a great chance to meet a new life where is full of love and peace. The most impressive aphorism to me, ""LOVE wins. LOVE always wins."""
5,Why make it difficult when it's so easy??,"Why would Albom want to make this book a wordy, weighty accout? He kept it light--he let his reader smile with Morrie and himself. He let us listen to his tape recorder. He let Morrie teach us--wasn't that the whole point? Self-help books be damned! Morrie wanted us to know what ""it"" is all about and Mitch wrote ""it"" so gently that no one need look further..."
3,Tuesdays With Morrie fails to deliver,"After all I'd heard about Tuesdays With Morrie, I figured this book would wind up on my list of favorites. It was destined for greatness, but lacked that something special to actually realise it's potential. After reading Tuesdays, I'm left craving for something more moving..."
5,A must read!,This is a great little book with sage advice on life's ultimate values. Well written! I'm buying copies for Christmas presents.
5,Unexpectedly I cry and not to finish it,"Definitely I can't stop reading but I don't expect I would cry. I did and at the moment, I don't want to finish it. I am afraid to read how he leaves us. I would like to pay my sincerest tribute to Morrie. He does remind me what we have forgotten. ""TO LOVE OR TO PERISH!"""
4,A New Outlook,This was an excellent book. Many young people today don't have the priviledge of talking to someone who is older and has a lot of experience in life. Young and old alike can benefit from reading this book. It can really change your outlook on life. Or at least give you something to think about.
1,"Hey, am I missing something here??",I read this book at breakfast this morning and felt like I've been robbed. What psychobabble! Shame on Mitch Albom. Can't believe this book got so many good reviews. Are people who read this book and loved it lacking in these simple insights about life and death? Haven't they ever read anything like this before? Most women's magazines and Readers' Digest have articles or snippets about people like Morrie confronting death and offering newly found wisdom. Mr. Albom should get back to covering sports.
5,This book touched my heart....,"This book really touched my heart. We all go through life chasing after goals, longing to fix what's missing, obtaining things such as status and wealth, and yet we really never feel fulfilled.What a gift Morrie Schwartz was not just to Mitch Albom, but to the world. His gift was ""living in the moment"". Morrie states many times you can not make up for things that happened in past, you can only forgive what you believe either you did wrong or what was done wrong to you and be where you are right now.He states at one point when his health is failing very badly that he is happier dying than most people are living.This book is a must read. Another book I really enjoyed about living in the moment is ""Working on Yourself Doesn't Work"" by Ariel & Shya Kane."
5,"The young aren't wise, and the wise aren't young.","What a wonderful book!Should be required reading for every adult. Especially if you find yourself immersed in the middle of all your ""things"" and asking yourself, ""Is this all there is?"".Before beginning your reading of this book, find your highliter marker, because there's plenty of comments about life worth marking (i. e. ""Without love, we're a bird with a broken wing"").My pastor often warns in his teachings about giving first-rate loyalties to third-rate causes. This book certainly reinforces that advice.Our perspective, and priorities change so much with age, and experiences.Excellent!"
4,A book full of Life lessons,"This was a very good book to read. Once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down. The way this old man is able to deal with his death,and still keep a positive perspective on life is amazing. He had an incredible view and life and shared it ith anyone who would listen. I reccomend this book to anyone who feels like there life doesn't mean anything. After reading this book, and reading what this man has to say on life you might feel different abou your life. I really enjoyed reading this book and thik everyone should read it."
3,3 and 1/2!!,"Tuesdays with Morrie is a very sweet book about a dying old man giving his last advice to a young man. The book is very touching, easy to read, and gives a new look on life. Morrie's advice to Mitch is inspiring. He explains the beauty of life, peace in death, and need for love. I would highly recommend this book to people of any age!"
5,tuesday with morrie,just wanted to drop a line to other readers that this book will give your emotions a work out. big tuff guy like me sure did cry alot. recommend it to every kind of tuff guy(even tuff gals).
1,Am I Alone Here?,"Am I the only person who feels like Mitch Albom writes with extreme egocentric undertones? I couldn't even absorb the lessons and wisdom I was supposed to be taking away from this book because I was so aggravated by Mr. Albom's narssicism. It seems like every page was steeped in a light bath of 'thank goodness Morrie had me' attitude. Not to mention the outright statements like the part where Mitch talks about if he died, his boss wouldn't even care as long as he had some of his amazing writing underneath his dead body.To me, a young but frequent reader, this book felt more like a tribute to Mitch than a tribute to Morrie. Did anyone else feel that way about this book? Or am I way off base here?"
2,Shocked at the good reviews!,"With all due respect to Professor Morrie, I mean no disrespect to his illness or the obvious many lives that he touched deeply.However, I found the book to lack depth. The writer professes the way he wastes life not loving enough and being positive like the mentor he neglected for years. Sure, this is a problem many people could sympathize with. We all take for granted the things we have until we are about to lose them. The book does not deliver on why we need each other even in the worst of times and only aims to highlight the courage of of his teacher whom he forgot about for so many years. I would have liked a deeper exploration of people in general and why we are so self-involved. I guess this was beyond a writer who has more experience writing about quarterbacks and goalkeepers.The book is good for hopeless people looking for even a douse of inspiration. That is as far as the writer can take you."
2,"Flat, drab, and vacuous pseudo-literature...","The author wants this book wants to be profound. He wants this book to be awe-inspiring. He wants this book to be an alarm bell that shakes us from our day to day complacency. This is all well and good, even respectable - indeed, perhaps more of us ought to strive for such noble ends. However, as one of the two main ""characters"" in the book, he comes across as incredibly naive and lacking much of anything resembling humanity. His semi-tough guy persona is nothing short of laughable, and his stilted prose renders a possibly moving experience inert. Under his pen, the depths or the human soul are made superficial and cliche. Do yourself and the rest of humanity a favor and read some Dostoeyevsky instead."
2,Judge this book by the cover,"Basically this is a decent book until you see Mitch Albom on tv and see that he goes against all the lessons he has ever learned from Morrie. Morrie is a good natured man, but his lesson are too much like things you would read in a Hallmark card. It was very old to keep reading his lessons because there were so many and they were all the same basic idea. Basicallyyou could read the first few chapters and still understand the entire book."
5,Simply put...a must read for '99!,"This book bridges gaps of communicating about death, life, and priorities for several generaltions, but mainly opens up talks for baby-boomers frightened of their own mortality.It is definitely a must-read!"
2,very disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with this book. Very. While Morrie appears to have been a kind and gentle man, there's nothing unique about his ""special"" insight (we should all love another). Prophets since the beginning of time have been telling us this. I also found the author's attitude rather self-serving: I think he smelled a ""story"" here and went for it. Well, he apparently has sold a bunch of books, so he was right, there was a ""story"" there."
4,SAFETY IN NUMBERS,"I read Tuesdays with Morrie because it has been on the best seller list for so long I thought, ""There must be something here."" There is. This is a heartfelt story of friendship and emotional maturing and deserves the bravos it has received."
4,"Great book, poor quality CD","The story is phenomenal, and I highly recommend it - however, the CD quality left something to be desired. It kept fading in and out (and I tested it on several systems to make sure it wasn't just mine - it wasn't, it's definitely the CD). Bummer, as it's kind of distracting to such a powerful story."
5,tuesday's with morrie is spectacular,"We had to read this book in English class and i thought it was going to be horrible but this book was a great life lesson it makes you think about yourself and how you treat others around you.this book made me realize that sometimes you need to just step back and look at your life and ask is this how i want to live and is this the person i want to be with if you have a spouse.when i was finished reading this book i really thought about alot of things,death,life, and am i treating everyone good. In my opinion this is a great book and i suggest everyone reads it"
4,Tuesday's with morrie,"I thought that the book Tuesday's with morrie was a great book to read. It was easy to follow, and to understand. I think that if you have time then you should read the book. It will make you think of life a little differently. It will change the way you think of every day things."
4,Good but too soft for my taste.,"This book is great... for an older person, but for anyone under the age of twenty its a real bore. The content of the book is all about learning life's lessons and learning to live life to the fullest. It is really not a subject most teens care to read about because most of us are still out partying and doing whatever. However the book does make you think about where your life is headed. In me it raised the question of whether or not my life will pan out the I feel it should, and when time runs down on my life and I finally die will I be satisfied with what I've accomplished. All in all this book is good, but I feel it is geared more toward older adult taste."
4,A pretty good book,"The book Tuesdays with Morrie was a pretty good book. The author never really repeated the same information a whole lot. This story teaches you a lot of life's lessons and it keeps you interested from the beginning. Over all I consider it one of the better books that I've read in a really long time, but that's probably because I don't read much. It's a true life story that everybody can relate to in some sense"
3,"Good writer, makes you watch the story","Intermediate (not basic, nor advanced) lessons in life and death encapsulated in a well written Novel."
5,great writer,i have not read this book yet but the author is great and a fun writer. i'm sure it will be good!
4,A Heartwarming Story About a Man and His Journey thru Life,"Tuesday's with Morrie is a touching story about an old man whose traveling dangerously close to death. He was a professor some years ago and one of his dearly beloved students comes to revisit him and rekindle there lost friendship. This student was Mitch Albom, and this professor was Morrie Schwartz. The reason for Mitch's return after many years was a recent article talking of Morrie's enlightenment into death. As this book progresses it draws the reader in and really let's them see how Morrie views death, life, and the world. Morrie also has daily euphuisms and these are like flashes of inspiration, which help lighten a path that may be dark. Tuesday's With Morrie is a great book that can really change a reader's outlook on life, and give them a whole new reason to live. Enjoy life for as long as you can for in the words of Morrie, ""We are not waves, we're part of the ocean."
1,Appalled at the misrepresentation,"I suffer from the same disease Morrie had -ALS or Lou Gehrig's. Albom's representation of the disease and how it impacts a sufferer is entirely wrong, in my experience. I am appalled that this man has made truckloads of money from this disease, without bothering to get his facts right. If he misunderstood it when he wrote the book, he should issue a new, revised edition.Far from the wonderful, uplifting experience that those who don't know the disease say they get from this book, I warn those who suffer from ALS and their families and friends to give this book a wide berth. It is all about Albom and does not give true credit to the real mental and physical anguish that those of us who suffer from the disease feel.This is not one of those wonderful books hat help the soul soar, it is an exercise in self aggrandisement, a misrepresentation of a serious and appalling disease and another example of media driven success, regardless of content."
3,fun simple read,"Life is full of questions. Unfortunately we rarely ask them. And if we ever do, we never seem to ask the right person.Tuesdays with Morrie is a modest book with a simple story and a simple message. Many years after graduating college, Mitch Albom reconnects with his favorite university professor Morrie Schwartz. Morrie is unashamedly up in age with the effects of ALS slowing overcoming his body. Mitch spends every Tuesday he can with the professor. They share many laughs and tears.It is a very simple read. Something you can probably knock out over the weekend. It probably will not change your life, but it will definitely spark some hope in mankind and make you want to find some old guy to talk to."
3,"Its ok, an interesting book.","After someone I met reccomended this book, I decided to get it. Not exactly life changing by any means, but was fun to read."
5,Have a box of tissues handy!,"For anyone who has a heart... this book will touch you! It was incredibly written and thought provoking. I work with older people everyday, I have often wondered which would be worse - having your body fail and your mind intact or having your mind fail first????? I still don't know."
5,Exceptional Reading,"Full of life experiences shared by Morrie and Mitch, this book announces the true spirit of sharing meaningful experiences with good friends. I recommend this book to anyone who desires to 1) learn about life, 2) become a mentor or mentee, and 3) desires to be a leader.Morrie is an incredible man with strength, endurance, and humility. He shows me what is really important in my life. Morrie's stories and experiences will live on forever. After I read this book, I realized what life is really about, friends. Please read this book, it's an experience you'll never forget!"
5,New look on life... in only 2 days,I could not put the book down. In only two days ones lifelong goals and ideas can be changed after reading this book. It is about as simple as it gets and makes it a must read book for anyone you care about. Enjoy!
4,Reminded me of what I've forgotten,"A friend of mine loaned me this book during a time of loss and sorrow in my life. It really helped me to realize that life does go on and what really matters in life- people and relationships. It has helped me to once again seek out human contact- to help, learn from, and to touch somebody's life everyday. This book is a good reminder of what everyone already knows but has forgotten."
5,deeply moving and inspiring,"This is a touching, poignant, insightful book... Morrie's unique perspective on life--his opinions and views--are undoubtedly significant, especially now where the current mindset seems to tend towards material and not emotional and spiritual well-being. The book is inspiring without being preachy, moving without being too mushy. After reading this book, I felt a heightened sense of appreciation and, yes, an outpouring of love for my family and friends. Worth reading..."
2,Kahlil Gibran said it better,"OK, OK, you made me cry......And I really did cry at parts of this book. And I have no doubt that Morrie was right in his approach to life. We could all do with more of his insights. But I kept thinking periodically, what is going on with his relationship with his wife, his closer family? Where are they as he dies?Well, let's give Mitch a break. It IS about Mitch's reactions to this man dying. (A little like my old college room mate calling me up after lo these may years and saying: ""Rusty, we haven't touched base for 25 years, and I was sitting here smoking my pipe, talking with my wife and kids, and sudenly I found myself thinking we'll be dead in 20 years and I ought to find out how the hell you are."")But Gibran said it more completely, poetically, and ultimately more universally 76 years ago when The Prophet was published."
1,rehashed homilies,"nothing to digest here. Bubblegum for the brain. Scan through the other comments and read the 1-2 stars. Dozens of other books that tackle ""life"" are much better. Even ""don't sweat the small stuff"" is much better. For those who have sentimental or idealistic feelings toward an old mentor (which I have), you might get something worth reading out of this, but not a guide to life you haven't heard since kindergarten..."
2,"Buy Morrie's ""Letting Go"" instead of Albom's book!","Why is this book more popular than Morrie's own ""Letting Go""? Mitch Albom says ""The last class of my old professor's life had only one student. I was the student."" But it sounds like Morrie Schwartz had a lot of visitors and a lot of people around him as he was dying. Albom doesn't show up until AFTER Nightline and Ted Koppel. Sort of the prodigal son! What about all the people who were with Morrie through his whole illness, not just at the very end? Hopefully Albom has donated ALL the proceeds from this book to Morrie's family! Otherwise the whole thing is just too self-serving."
5,Learn about life,This is a wonderful book. This book makes us realize many issues in life that we do not have time to think about. It has many explanations on why people do what the society do. It also teaches us to think about things that we don't normally think about such as dealing with dying and death.
5,Tuesdays With Morrie A Tear Jerker,"Tuesdays With Morrie is a great boook by Morrie Albom. If you are looking for a great tear jerker book, this book is for you. This book is about life and the lessons that you should learn in life. Morrie is Mitch's old Professor from college. Mitch finds out that Morrie is dying of Lou Gehrig's Disease which totally takes control of him and he tells Mitch that he can't even wipe his own [rear]. Mitch decides that he is going to fly from Chicago to Massachusetts every Tuesday to see Morrie. Every week Morrie gets worse and worse, but he still teaches Mitch very important lessons about life. What Mitch learns from Morrie he will hold onto for the rest of his life. Mitch will no longer be as scared of dying now that he has seen Morrie have such a long painful death. This true story will bring tears to your eyes and you will learn about the important aspects of life from a dying man."
2,Tuesdays with Morrie,"This book definitely leaves you thinking. The message I got from this book is to live each day as if it were your last, and of course"" love each other or perish""...which is so true. Anyway its a good read, its not just a book you'd read and toss over your shoulder, it truly is inspiring and I strongly recommed it.-Nermine"
5,"""Tuesday People""","I found the book Tuesdays with Morrie extremely thought provoking. It addressed a lot of big issues that our world constantly faces. I really liked this book because I could relate to it. Some of the advice that Morrie gave Mitch was what I really needed to hear. It gave me a new understanding and appreciation for life. I think anybody over the age of 12 would be able to comprehend and enjoy this book. Tuesdays with Morrie really challenges your views and beliefs. There was not anything in this book that I would change. The only thing I did not like was how it was so predictable. However, every time I read this book, I was anxious to learn a new life lesson from Morrie. I really felt like I was the one who was flying in to meet with Morrie, in his office, on Tuesdays, rather than Mitch."
3,So Life isn't a bed of roses when it comes right down to it.,"Yup, the things we can learn from hardship. Not that we would chose it, but great reality check. Makes me appreciate the twists and turns of life that depend our character and reform our values. Tough going to actually step by step accompany a friend to death's door."
3,What You Can Learn from a Dying Man,"Mr. Albom's small book recounting his visits with his old friend, as the latter fades away from disease, is invariably insightful and affirming of what you know already to be true, and frequently tear-inducing as well. What do you already know to be true that you are ignoring? That the important things are not money or busy-ness. The important things are love and appreciation of the world around us. It's just that Albom's (and Morrie's) prose is dull and artless. It doesn't soar, it doesn't sing. I wanted more from a book about a dying man's view of life. And I definitely wanted something new to hear. Well, this is a good book, and perhaps more people ought to read it, just as it is. If you're undecided about buying the book vs. the tape version, here's a tip: At the end of the tape, the producers have given us a generous sampling of excerpts from the tape recordings Albom made while with Morrie. It's great to hear the old man say it in his own voice."
4,Food For Thought,"This book was not what I expected. It really moved me. In ways I didn't expect. It reveals compassion, change, acceptance and most important, the need to feel. I would recommend this book to anyone who could use a little nudge when it comes to reality and what is really important. Aside from the core issue, dying, this is about living. It was well written, easy to follow and held my attention for a few nights. This is not just about losing and finding again. It is about life."
4,Thumbs Up!,"This book is an enjoyable read. It is packed with meaning and emotion. There is so much that can be learned from Morrie's words and life. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages, especially those who have forgotten to stop and smell the roses."
3,not THAT inspirational,"I think this book is highly inspiring mostly to those who are uninspired. If you have examined your life and asked the difficult questions, then this book will not be an epiphany as it is to so many people. To me, this a was a basic ""what is the meaning of life"" book. I didn't find the story to be particularly interesting or unique. What I found interesting was the character growth of Mitch Albom who was an idealist brought down to earth by the harsh realities of life but finds his idealism again through Morrie.Overall, I think the book is a worthwhile read. Just don't expect it to offer you something you have never heard or thought of before."
5,Morrie had it half right,"This book is very inspirational, and should draw a tear or two to your eyes. Morrie Schwartz, who has the ""luxury"" of knowing approximately when he will die, uses his remaining time to impart much of his wisdom to one of his favorite old college students. He teaches us what most of us should already know, be must be reminded of anyway - that our relationship with our fellow man is infinitely more important than what else we do in our hectic lives.But what really made me sad was Morrie is only half right. Our relationships are the key - but it isn't only our relationship with our fellow man which is important, but also our relationship with our creator. He put us here for a reason. We are here for His glory.I highly recommend this book for all to read."
1,Amateurish and Simple,"This book is poorly written, poorly developed, pretentious and above all sanctimonious to it's very core. It will indeed change your life though, it will make you realize that popular contemporary books are complete wastes of time and natural resources that could have been put to better use making toilet paper. I highly recommend burning this book-it deserves nothing else. If you disagree with this posting and feel that ""Tuesday's with Morrie"" is the greatest thing since sliced bread, well...I feel sorry for you. Terrible. Trash. Could have been written by any bum off the street."
3,An introduction to Lou Gehrig's Disease,"My dad bought this book for me after he had previously read and enjoyed it. I agree with the people who think this book is somewhat cliche, but what interested me was the information about Lou Gehrig's Disease. I really didn't know anything about it before, so in that sense this book was eye-opening. It is a very scary disease, and I really hope a cure is found for it ASAP."
5,"An insightful, embraceable literary journey","I read this book very shortly after the loss of my mother. Understandably, I was hesitant. What I found, however, was neither morbid nor depressing. This is an uplifting insight into the journey we are all taking and provides the reader with a deeper appreciation for life - beginning, middle and end. The lessons given so freely and honestly are not new, but are definitely worth repeating because we seem to forget them so easily. The gift these two men gave me is one that I will endeavor to hold dear, enabling me to reach my final days with such serenity and acceptance. This book is on my Christmas gift list for all those close to me."
1,Tuesdays with Snoring,"Tuesday's with Morrie is a book that philosophizes about death and enlightenment. The book in my honest opinion is not for youth. It seems like a book with not enough passion for young readers. After the author describes Morrie's condition as he slowly dies I found myself not caring after a while and found reading the book as a tedious task. There was never a point in which I was totally involved in the book. Some people might view this as an emotional tale, and say it's a touching book, but this is hard to imagine. This book seems dry of any thing vaguely close to gripping emotion. I don't know which age group to recommend this book for, maybe for the older readers who no longer have good taste in books or are feeling that they connect with Morrie, and his disease. Now im not saying that if you are required to read this book you are going to go through hell and back, but there are definitely better choices."
1,dreck,"A slim volume of advice that is shallow and insignificant offered to a writer who is vain and selfish. There are many other, better books that offer insights into ordinary Americans that this one does. Try, At Home in the Heart of Appalacia instead."
3,Dirty,I bought this book as a Christmas present. It said it was in very good condition but when I got it the cover/book jacket was filthy. I had to take off the cover in order to give it as a present. It looked like coffee or pop had been spilled all over it. Other than that it was fine.
5,One Day Read-Lifetime of Wisdom,"Tuesdays with Morrie is a great one day read to take along on a plane, to the beach or anytime you will have the opportunity to read. Mitch is the everyman in this work, too wrapped up in life and not enough in truly living. Morrie is the voice of wisdom and experience, who desperately wants to live his last days with as much love and meaning as possible. Together again after many years apart, both find their coach/player, student/teacher relationship deeply meaningful and rewarding up until Morrie's passing and beyond.We should all be as fortunate as Mitch to have a mentor in life, and wise enough to recognize it. Filled with wisdom on many aspects of life, Morrie teaches Mitch, and us, that love and relationships are the highest aspiration of life. I completely agree."
2,Not all it's perked up to be!,"After reading ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"" by the same author, and reading/hearing comments about ""Tuesdays with Morrie,"" I really thought this was going to be a great read also-- but it wasn't. Reviewers make it seem as though there are so many revealing thoughts and lessons to be learned through this book, however, I found most of them to be common sense based. It was interesting to follow how this elderly man degenerates, yet keeps a positive attitude all throughout. Nonetheless, it wasn't as engaging to read as ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven."""
1,"Good for the careerist, bad for the rest","This book is probably beneficial for careerists too absorbed in an objective-oriented, material world to value the other aspects of life, especially being a testimony from one of their own. As an instrument of social change, 3 stars.But it is essentially useless to anyone else with a pre-existing and healthy skepticism of human nature, activity, and group functioning. For this, no stars.More points off for cheesy melodrama, giving a grand total of 1 star."
5,"Of life, loss, and redemption...","This is the real thing, a story about deep loss and soaring redemption. It portrays and promotes a gentleness that reminds me of ""The Prince Mammoth Pumpkin~A Parable"" by James Adams. This book will touch your soul."
2,Emperor's New Clothes perhaps?,"This book was highly recommended to me so I bought it ... looking for some answers to a personal struggle.I will say that I am fairly disappointed. As some other reviewers indicated, the book could easily have been reduced to about 80 pages and had the same effect for me. I kept hoping that things would improve as I got closer to the end. Unfortunatley that never happened.Seems like a nice tribute to a loveable old professor but the book was not well written. Many details that would have added to the depth of the book were left out ... and other musings were repeated over and over.I'm not sure why all the rave about this book. Plenty of others out there that truly make this book look almost silly. Glad it really didn't take me long to finish it, otherwise I'd have been annoyed."
3,"Good, Not Great","I had heard so much about this book and it continued to be on that ""must read"" someday when I have available time. So I finally got around to it. I am glad I read it. I find that I like Mitch Albom's style of writing (I also just finished The Five People You Meet in Heaven. I find him to be clear, concise and not overly descriptive -- I can not tolerate authors who need many pages to describe the color of the autumn leaves!Yet, maybe because of the hype, I expected more. For some reason, although I appreciate the soundness of Morrie's philosophies, I felt they weren't presented in an inspirational, life changing style. Overall, it left me somewhat flat. (And for me, that is quite unusual.)However I am thrilled that it's another off of my to be read list.Barbara Kent, authorSuccess in the Words of the Masters"
5,Inspirational!,"This book is absolutely amazing! I read this book in one sitting, which I almost never do; I could not put it down. This book is so profound and inspirational and know it is a book that has had an impact on my life. If we all could be a little bit more like Morrie, this world would be a wonderful place. This is a must read, but be sure to have some tissue close by because more than likely you will cry."
5,"Living 101, as Taught by a Dying Man","This memoir of a professor's last days is a small book, but its lessons in living leave a big and lasting impression. Morrie Swartz had a hard childhood but he grew into a man who loved life. As a college professor, he always had a bonus for his students - a lesson in living. He continued to enjoy every moment of life even while he watched himself die the slow death of Lou Gehrig's Disease. The author visited with his old professor Morrie every Tuesday during the last weeks of Morrie's life, and in recording their conversations, he allowed Morrie to leave a lesson plan in living for all of us. You'll not only want to read it again and again yourself, but you'll want to tell everybody you know to read it."
5,An inspiring story,"I picked up this book at the local library and I read it this weekend and to my surprise it was a great book. Morrie Schwartz was an outstanding individual whom had a great zeal for life and taught people around him how to really appreciate what is important in life which did not include money, fame or success. However, Morrie showed his prize student Mitch that stopping to smell the roses, love, family and community were really the important things that mattered and God's true blessing. This book really moved me and I would recommend it to anyone who feels so overwhemled in their daily lives, because this book will give you the perspective of what is really important in life."
5,I liked it. 5 stars,"I read this book because I was looking for grief books and the bookstore salesperson pointed it out as a good book. I read the book, not as a manual on dealing with death, but as an interesting story of friends and their impending loss.I found that Mitch picked up on some interesting points as well as some minor ones that many of us would miss. Mitch kept bringing Morrie food even when Morrie wasn't eating much. We all try to continue to act how we wish it would be or hoped it could be. We try to make things remain as normal as possible and it is hard to adjust to the change especially when we know we are going to lose someone.Pick this book up because it is a good read.I also would recommend, Healing Stories of Grief and Faith, From Denial and Despair to Comfort and Peace to those experiencing grief."
1,This book is trivial,This isn't chicken soup for the soul; it is barely a bouillion cube. There is nothing here. Just alot of obvious blah/blah about how life should be treasured because it is ephemeral. And Mitch Albom seems like an exploitative opportunist. I think the old guy killed himself to escape Mitch Albom's smug presence. Yuk.
1,A disappointing book.,"There must be more in a person's mind, as death approaches, than has been discussed in this book. I also don't understand the raves about the book. I found it rather insipid and definitely lacking substance. The problems with the author's brother could have been developed more thoroughly, perhaps for greater interest."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"Just because a man is old and dying doesn't mean that he automatically knows all. Morrie made statements about how life should be lived. These statements were accepted by the characters in the book as the truth just because he was dying. I just couldn't accept this. Although this book was very highly recommended to me by a friend as a ""must read"", I was greatly disappointed in the lack of substance."
1,This is one inspid book.,The professor sounds like a great guy but Albom took his wisdom and distilled it into a Hallmark card of platitudes. But the book is worth reading to learn the magic formula that creates a best-seller. I wish I wrote this book. For the $$$$
5,"This story has changed the way I view life, and death.",Tuesdays with Morrie touched me very deeply. I plan to give several copies as gifts this Christmas.
4,The Grace of the Living,Reading TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE was a wonderful experience. The dialogue worked well and the author's style introduces another ethnographic approach to writing about the self in the company of fellow earthlings. I finished the book feeling more human and compassionate than when I first opened it.
4,Memorable,"When Mitch learns that his favorite professor from college is ill with ALS (Lou Gherig's disease) he resumes his relationship with Morrie and the two begin meeting again on Tuesdays as they had done years before. Rather than being bitter about steadily losing the functions of his body, Morrie embraces the prolonged opportunity to say his goodbyes. Morrie shares the stories of his life with Mitch and reminds him what is really important in life. Morrie's health deteriorates, but Mitch's hardened and cynical outlook on life softens and his heart is renewed. The life lessons in this book stay with you."
5,Inspirational,"I read this book quite some time ago, but it has left a lasting impression upon me. Makes one feel inspired to do more with their life while they still can. I heartily recommend this book!"
4,well....,"It has great condition and price. but adding shipping fee, I'm not sureIf it was good deal...."
3,Excellent story,the story is very good a must read.... the shipping was quick but not in the described condition....
3,5 points out of 10,this book reminds me a lot of Conversations with my dog by Ziglar.....if I had to choose one book out of the two.....it would definetely be Albom. Both books offer life lessons about many things in life....thought it would be better though....i am getting the DVD to see how the movie does.
5,"If you want to know how to live, read the book","I finished the book in two days during the holidays--couldn't put it down. The book answers many important questions in my life. It provided much serenity in the hectic and overly commercialized holiday season. The book takes you with Morrie in his final journey in life. Morries' words made me re-evaluate my attitudes towards life, love, marriage, forgiveness, children and death. Throughout the reading, I kept wanting to fly up to Boston to meet Morrie. The book is especially a must read for the busy and ambitious professionals in big cities like NYC. Buy it and read it TODAY!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A caring insightful book,"For those readers who found nothing in this book for them - my condolensces. The lessons imparted to Mitch by Morrie in learning how to live with high minded priorities and learning how to die with dignity are something we all need to know. And if we think we know them - we may need to be reminded. This book did that It is a reminder of decency, caring and love of fellow man that needs to be on everyone's bookshelf."
5,If you ever wonder about the true meaning of life...,"check out this book! In an age of instant gratification and a world which at times moves needlessly fast, Mitch Alboms masterpiece brings clarity to the important things in life. His book touched my soul and, at least for the moment, helped me re-prioritize things in my life. Hey, I even left my cell phone turned off this weekend!"
5,A thoroughly enjoyable read.,I had noticed this book on the bestsellers lists and thought it might be interesting. I probably wouldn't have gotten it for myself. I received the book as a Christmas gift and it was far more enjoyable than I thought. I gave the book to someone and told them to pass it along when they were done - that's the highest praise I can give a book.
2,"sad, yes...but did the author exploit the subject?","A sad story, yes. Morrie was a terrific subject and his lessons are timeless. But, I have to wonder how Mitch Albom sleeps at night. From all he ""learned"", or allegedly gained from these ""Tuesdays"" didn't he exploit Morrie just a bit? Morrie encourages us all to live for today, stop, enjoy the little things around us, LIVE, not just to work, to make money, but LIVE! I put the book down at times rejoicing in these simple words.How then, is it that Mitch Albom, one of Morrie's great students, gets away w/writing his story? What did/does he get but the profits from a dying old professor? Hmmmm....what did Mitch come away with? From the look of it, a bunch of dough.Yes, we're the richer for learning a little about Morrie and of ALS but Mitch Albom is richer for exploiting him, and apparently, not that much wiser for knowing him."
4,Touching,"This is a great little book to sit down and read in a sitting or two. More than anything, it is a testament to the profound way teachers and professors can affect their students and a reminder of the wisdom that can be attained from our elders--a concept the youth-oriented culture of the United States has difficulty grasping. To the more learned and literate individual, none of the lessons here are new, but the book is still touching."
4,Forever Changed,"I read Tuesdays With Morrie, in my 20th century literature class. Most people in my class disliked the book, as I enjoyed it. I love reading true biographies and finding out interesting facts about their life. Mitch was influenced by an old college professor if his, Morrie. The book made me realize that certain people in our lives leave such a huge impact that you don't realize they have. Mitch was forever changed by Morrie and his ""Life's Greatest Lessons."""
3,A little too optimistic considering the circumstamces.,"I'm sure words such as touching, poignant, etc., have been used to describe this book, and in many ways it was. However, here is a man who continues to be upbeat, cheerful, maintain a positive attitude towards life and people, and spout many little philosophical tidbits all while his health is deteriorating rapidly day by day because of Lou Gehrig's disease. Personally, I have a hard time grasping how somebody can maintain such a positive attitude in the face of a debilitating illness such as this, but I'm glad I read the book. This story has the ability to teach people some valuable lessons if they are willing to learn them."
5,"Morrie, although dead, changed my life","Tuesdays with Morrie was a reading assignment for my english class,I didn't believe it would be that good. The book touched my heart so much. I just wish that I could of met the hero (Morrie). He changed my life. In the future I hope I can model my life to be a little more like he was all the way to the end."
5,inspirational and easy to read,"I can see why this book has been a best-seller for almost a year. It is a moving book and, because the chapters are short, it is an easy book to pick up and put down at will."
4,"Touchy, but a great lesson","After seeing the movie, I like the book even more. It's a sweet story and touchy. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that while in this great last lesson of life, and the frequent discussions of subjects like death, God wasn't mentioned once. It's human wisdom, and the conclusions are that love always wins, and that to forgive every day is important. But still, it's a great book and it brings redemption in focusing our lives back to the real issues. One other book that I really liked and that deals with the most important issues of life, this book does it from a spiritual viewpoint, although remaining practical in its application, is Dietmar Scherf's ""I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression"" -- also available at Amazon.com"
1,Disappointing - lack of substance,"This book was extremely disappointing. There was nothing new or inspirational that hasn't been captured in countless cliches - and the entire focus of the book was on the author, not the teacher. Where was Mitch for 20 years? How meaningful is a relationship that was academic in its beginning, on hiatus for 20 years, and subject for a book in the last few weeks? This is not a lesson in living & dying - it's an example of selfishness and how to make money under the guise of enlightening other people and romanticizing death. If you must read it, at least get it from the library."
2,The author did not go into enough depth.,"I was left feeling very much dissappointed in the book,especially after all the hype. Had the author spent more time on helping the reader get to know Morrie,I possibly could have felt more compassion and empathy than I did. To be honest,neither the authoe, nor the professor seemed to be very likable people. The book was very over-rated. Don't buy it, just go to the library and check it out."
1,Could this be more trite?,"What makes a wonderful personal memory doesn't necessarily translate into an enlightening read for others. No doubt Mitch holds vivid deeply felt memories of his former professor - who sounds like quite a wonderful guy - but the ""lessons"" learned are obvious."
5,Best book I've ever read,"I had a very dear friend who had AlS. She bought at least 36 of these books for family, friends and caregivers. What a wonderful gift it was that she gave us. My friend Pat Bodnar, like Morrie chose to live life to the fullest, A lesson to be learned from reading this book is that you have a choice, you can give up, or like Morrie and Pat, you can live while you're dying. I recommend this book to everyone. Once you start reading it, you won't put it down till you've read the last page!!"
5,A MUST-READ! EXCELLENT!,"I read this book in 2 nights. I recommend it to anyone from the ages of 10 to 110. It makes you appreciate life, growing old, compassion for the sick, and friendship. If you've ever lost someone through a terminal illness, I guarantee you will not be able to put this book down. You'll be laughing and crying throughout this book."
5,This book was very powerful. Albom really shines here.,"It really makes you take another look at life, and the way that you are living it. I've read many books, and this one beats them all."
5,"Morrie, a teacher for life . . .","Just saw a snippet of Morrie's interview with Ted Koppel and felt compelled to write a short review about this book.As a cynic who rarely looks at the positive side of things, the book really woke me up and made me understood what gratitude meant and how it can change your life. Despite his illness and decaying ""body"", Morrie's spirit was very much alive and goes to show us the true strength of the human spirit.A well written book that lead to MANY moments of laughter and tears and finally, satisfaction as you read through the final chapters."
5,TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE,"This is a beautiful, life-changing, life-affirming book. ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" is a story that will make the reader rethink his or her relationships and can be the start of a healing process for estranged families. The enthusiasm for life that this man has is astounding and incredibly uplifting. His philosophy is that each day we wake up is a gift from God, so what do we do with a gift? Do we celebrate, honor and cherish it or defile, ignore and take it for granted? Morrie never loses his dignity because he never loses his love and appreciation of that gift. This is a book to treasure and re-read whenever we've had a bad day and buy plenty to keep on hand for gifts."
3,True sharing but short,"A beautiful story. It is true sharing since the author is able to expose his faults and grow from them, to transform. However the ""wisdom"" shared in this book is no more than a few lines so I would say it is more of a pamphlet of wisdom than a book. Still worth reading."
4,Tuesdays with Morrie,"Tuesdays with Morrie was an inspiring book. This book is motivation to many people who might have ALS. ALS is a disease that makes your nerve system break down and your muscles weaken. Morrie is the main character that has this deadly disease. He could be a hero to many people that might have lost a loved one or those who have been affected by this disease. Morrie was Mitch's inspiration in life. He gave Mitch a reason to love and respect life. Morrie taught Mitch that when someone knows they are dying they don't take things for granted. He believes that people should look at objects and respect their level of importance. I believe that Morrie had only a few of his favorite students. Mitch was treated like one of them. Mitch wrote this book out of respect and love of Morrie. Over all, this was an extraordinary book."
5,Bittersweet,"""The truth is Mitch, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live"". Powerful words from a powerful book. Tuesdays with Morrie is filled with mini-lessons that will help you appreciate the beauty of life. Mitch Albom paints a magnificent picture of a man dying with dignity. It also shows that the true measure of a man is expressed in the love that surrounds him when he is in his final days of life."
4,Morrie,"Again,another great book. If this is a true story I would love to meet someone like him. I wouldn't want to lose a friend like that. How hard that would be to hear a mans life and grow to be friends like that and then watch him go like that. It would be a blessing to know that you would have a friend to stay with you through it all and God bless you for that.Thanks for sharing that with us, what a wonderful story. I can't wait to hear some more.Sherrie"
1,Agree w/ Reader from USA...,"The ""Reader from Usa"" below is absolutely correct. Just another piece of pop fluff full of platitudes to make us ""feel good"" and gloss over the real tragic alienation we all feel in late capitalism. But ""Reader from Usa's"" attempt to point people to the philosophy section is just spitting in the wind. Because those books actually require you to use your brain, engage the texts and think about them. This book is just another piece of that pre-fab, chewy goodness that consumer society just loves to serve up."
2,a feel good book lacking depth,"While this book is somewhat engaging, and one can't help but feel an emotional connection to Morrie, it is sorely lacking in depth. If you want a book that will help you to put your priorities in order and help you decide what it truly important in life, may I recommend the following: ""Gift of the Sea"" by AM Lindberg; ""Your Erroneous Zones"" by W Dyer, ""The Road Less Traveled"" by Scott Peck, and the New Testament"
1,Where's the beef?,"Wow...I could't believe how bad this book was. Anyone with a college or university degree will be offended by this dumbed-down poorly written piece of trash. If you want to follow a philosophy that can change your life pick up an Ayn Rand book. ""Love or parish""....sure Morrie that makes a lot of sense. Last time I checked Love is earned not unconditional. If you want to enjoy life and have self-esteem you should stay away from this mystic/irrational trash heap."
2,TUESDAY,"AS A FUTURE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL I THINK THAT THE BOOK ""TUESDAY WITH MORRIE"" WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK. IT HAD A LOT OF SAD PARTS THAT MAKE A PERSON MORE INTERESTED IN THE BOOK. I FEEL THAT A PERSON THAT TAKES TIME OUT HIS DAY TO SPEND WITH A FRIEND IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY. THAT'S WHY I GAVE THIS BOOK TWO STARS. AS A STUDENT OF MORRIE'S MITCH GREW CLOSER AND CLOSER TO MORRIE ONCE HE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALS, THAT SOON HE WOULD DIE. EVERY CHANCE MITCH HAD TO SPEND TIME HE DID AND THAT SHOWS THAT HE CARED A LOT FOR MORRIE. THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD AND DEDICATE IT TO ANYONE GOING INTO THE MEDICAL FIELD."
5,Awakening,"Some people may say this book is just the same old stuff ""re-written"". But even if that is true we need to be reminded of these life lessons. To many times in our lives we forget what is really important. Morrie reminds us about everything we all forget at one point or another in our lives. Read this book if you want to be reminded of what really matters in our lives."
5,Such a beautiful book...,"After all the delaying i finally got hold of a copy of ""tuesdays with Morrie"" and i absolutely loved it..the book is heart touching and in a simple and honest way tells us how we can add more meaning to our lives.."
4,tuesdays with Morrie,A heart-warming story of friendship and the triumph over adverity. Shows how companionship can endure despite the difference in ages between the author and his former teacher.
5,Awesome Book,This book is one of my favorites it was required for one of my classed I got into it and I read it in a week. I recommend this book to anyone. It will simply change your outlook at life.
1,Albom needs to take writing classes,"""He waited for these kisses like a puppy waits for milk."" Seriously? Albom really thought this was a good analogy to use? When I read that line, I literally rolled my eyes. My 10 year old nephew writes better than Albom. The poor grammar, run-on sentences, etc, made me cringe. Not to mention, it was obvious that Albom only got in touch with Morrie because Morrie had been on Nightline. Albom wrote that his main goal in life had been to be famous. Thanks to good ol' Morrie, he's accomplished it. Albom fancies himself a great writer. Don't be fooled by the hype. This isn't good writing nor thought provoking. I was too distracted by the technical errors."
2,"Tuesdays With Morrie, A story of Mitch Albom and his ego","Tuesdays With Morrie was basically a story of Mitch Albom feeling sorry for some old man. While morrie's views on life were insightful, Mitch's outlook on him self and morrie cancel out the good things about this book. Page after page was constant contradictions and examples of Mitch's enormous ego. I found it weird how Mitch didn't bother looking morrie up until he saw him in poor condition on TV. Mitch only thought to visit morrie because morrie made him feel good about himself. Mitch made it sound like he was the only thing keeping morrie alive.I would only reccommend this book to someone who likes to disagree with people's opinions and actions."
5,Don't go through life half asleep,"If you feel like your 9-5 job is just a ""means to an end"" type job, I highly suggest reading this. Being only 25 myself I feel the lessons learned from this book could very well change my life for the better. It showed me to go out and do what you love, materialistic junk is not the answer."
1,An insult to the man,"Morrie was obviously an amazing, caring, wise person. He got that way by living a life of service to humankind, by focusing on more important things than money. So along comes this journalist who jots down a few quotes, and people flock to it saying how much they learned. This totally misses the point. Morrie's life demonstrates that there are no shortcuts to the lessons he's learned, but in our quick-shot read-a-book-and-now-I-know-everything society, people think they ""get it."" Morrie specifically says that he hates self help books, and yet now his life and death have been turned into one. How sad."
2,Too straight-forward,Tries to be an inspiring story (in a self-help sort of way). But the writing style is so straight-forward an unimaginative that I found it pretty boring.
2,"Nice story, bad book","This is a really nice story about a guy who is clearly very nice and just being around Morrie makes everyone else even nicer, including the reader. But it just isn't a good book. Every quote from Morrie is straight from one of those books of inspirational quotations, one after another.I also have to wonder about the effect on Mitch Albom after spending this time with Morrie. He seems to be working as much as ever, just adding this book and movie to his plate.I don't want to criticize Morrie or his effect on people. But this book isn't worth $21."
1,"Trite and cliche-ridden, written by opportunist","What a banal load of crap! Do people really buy this stuff? I read the story of a marginally talented writer taking advantage of a dying man to push national buttons. Yikes this book was terrible. Buy a pound of Hallmark cards next time, you'll get the same insights."
1,"How many ways can you say, ""Money isn't everything?""","OK, I suppose I'm in the minority. But I got so tired of this book! Every Tuesday Mitch goes to see Morrie and, every time, Morrie tells Mitch to slow down and smell the roses. I really got the idea the first Tuesday, and I didn't need the rest.Morrie keeps telling Mitch that money isn't everything. But I kept wondering if Morrie's tune would be different if he didn't have the private nurses to take care of him.Of course Morrie had already died long before I got the book (oops-- I hope I didn't give away the ending...), but as I read the book, I couldn't help wishing he'd get on with it."
2,Astoundingly bad,"I picked up Tuesdays with Morrie at a yard sale recently, after having heard for years about what a life-affirming book it is. I lost my grandfather about 2 years ago and had many heart-to-heart talks with him in his declining years. I hoped the book would capture some of that sensibility. Instead, it was the most trite piece of crap I've read in years. While Morrie was most certainly a commendable person and inspirational teacher, [...] And things that seem to Mitch to be revelatory are the most obvious things that should have occurred to most people by adolescence. Yuck."
3,"Yeah, yeah, but...","I'm the odd duck who didn't LOVE this book. Yeah, yeah, it was sad and sweet and touching and all that. But it's a cliche to have an old man on his deathbed imparting hard-earned wisdom to a brash young comer. I probably would have liked Morrie, actually, but I think I'd have emphasized a different side of him, if I'd been writing about him. This reads too much like the ubiquitous Chicken Soup series. Too much of a good thing, even truly good things, is still too much. I'm over it."
3,"Heartwarming, but with an Ugly Side","""Tuesdays with Morrie"" was certainly touching. Albom has created a fast, mostly-charming, and engaging read, with maybe one too many one-sentence paragraphs used for emphasis. This story caused me to survey my own level of passion and sensitivity. But I also recognize Morrie as a full-fledged anti-capitalist. He believes (and states so) that our (U.S.) economy and culture make people run around feeling threatened. Frankly, I feel he's crossed the line into poppycock at that point. I think the book uses his deathbed lessons as a means to push this political statement. That was disappointing for such a touching story. But I still cried when the old man died."
5,worth to read,"This is a book I read in summer school. It was a very thoughtful story. A college professor who had cancer used the last days of his life to teach his formal student the most valuable lessons, the lessons of life and death. The student in the story wrote this book himself, everything in this was very honest and it really worth people to read it."
5,Tuesdays With Morrie,"I think this book should be required reading for all highschool students.It is such a thoughtful insight into the human spirit and the human condition without being laden with the trappings of overwhelming sadness and concentration on death, in fact it is a celebration of life, by Morrie himself, the dying character, which is so uplifting. It is beautifuly written by Mitch Albom, whom I had only known as a radio guy and that too, lends itself to the depth of the book. it goes deep enough with out leaving the reader left with a feeling of loss,but rather of having gained something very important in the book's final pages.."
4,Very sad,"My husband was given this book as a gift. He isn't much of a reader if it isn't work, golf or flying related but this book changed him. He loved this book. Yes, he cried but that was OK with him. It was my husband that insisted I read it, too. So....I found it to be well written, a page turner, gripping, but so darn sad. I just don't like getting depressed and crying anymore."
2,A Small Disappointment,"Influenced by what I've heard about the book over the media, I rushed out to get the book as soon as I could. It was a little disapointing to discover how light the book was. It left me with an small void, a nagging feeling that there should have been more to it than just that."
4,morrie had it together,"This book moved me to rethink what life is all about. What's important and what isn't. Morrie had a lesson for all of us, not just the author. I am compelled to share my newfound feelings with my children, and will definately share this wonderful book with them during the holiday season. Isn't love a wonderful thing!"
1,A true disappointment!!!,"This book is easy to read, and, at times, very funny. However, it lacks depth, and was utterly disappointing in that regard. The book, overall, left me wanting more. I must agree with the review and comment from the New York Times...This book simply fails to enlighten!!"
4,we talked about the book,"I had read this book a couple of times in high school, but it really didn't mean much to me then. When I saw that this was part of the assignment in my sociology class, I more than procrastinated in picking it up again because I thought it was the same old thing, but I was pleasantly surprised. The book read faster than I had remembered, and I actually got interested in the topics that Mitch and Morrie discussed. Their practical life lessons, I thougth, were valuable things for just about everyone to know. I really enjoyed this book, and it has made me look at life, living, and eventually dying, a little bit differently."
5,A great lesson for life...,"I could read this book over and over and never get tired of the simple messages that abound within its pages. ALS (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is a horrible illness to deal with, but the optimistic way in which Morrie approached the final days of his life is a testament to how we should all live. Mitch Album expertly displays the importance of living each day to the fullest and not taking anyone for granted with this piece of work."
3,Short but Sweet,"Endearing booklet about a yuppie sportswriter in a mild midlife crisis who rediscovers his sociology professor from Brandeis, a sweet old man whose charisma has also attracted Ted Koppel and Nightline to witness the professor's last days as he succombs to ALS. The author makes weekly pilgimages to receive fatherly affection and sage advice from his expiring mentor, consisting of simple truisms made more poignant by the progress of the old man's disease, and the imminence of his demise.I lost my cynicism about the length of the book, and its price, when I learned in the afterward that the book was Morrie's idea, and that the advances helped pay medical bills. It's a pretty puny dose of chicken soup, but at the Amazon price it makes a nice gift because its easy to read and carries a warm, loving message."
4,This book touched my heart!,"It's amazing, we live in a world that is so into death anddying. Being able to look past the norm and find out what reallymatters is what's infront of you moment to moment. That is how Morrie lived his life. He wasn't going to let a disease kill him off before he dies.Morrie thought everyday people who lived their lives running around always living in the future were missing what and who they really were. They would miss experiences and people that could have been influential to their lives. He thrived on love. Love is what kept him around. He believed in being with the person you're with, moment to moment. That is why I recommend this book. Living in a world of always racing around to the next thing not appreciating what you really have. Morrie taught you how to appreciate life ..."
4,Good,"I know everyone seems to love Tuesdays with Morrie. I liked it.I too have spent time with people who are dying; people once vibrant and hopeful, busy living and loving and have found much wisdom in their experiences and end of life perceptions and perspectives. Morrie's thought's, while simple, profound and wise have been echoed by others. The best lesson I took from this story was one of respect. The lack of respect our society give those who have journeyed through this life and almost reached the end. The wisdom that experience has gifted them is not necessarily as valued as it could, as it should be."
5,Good for College Students and Professors,"This was an awesome book. A real story about life. I truly believe every human being can relate to this book in some way or another. I loved this book because it carried emotion. It made me cry, laugh, and I related to experiences in it. I titled this review, ""Good for College Students and Professors"" because it could be a good guideline for those types of individuals to interact with each other. This book made me want to strive for a good relationship with my college professors. I hope I am able to do that just like Mitch Albom did with his college professor, Morrie Schwartz. Not only does this book show good relationships, it also explains life's lessons and the important things in life. Along with the important things in life Morrie explains to Mitch the specific objects and emotions that should not be taken for granted. I would suggest this book to anyone who is having a hard time dealing with life and the obstacles it hands to everyone."
5,A Must Read,"With 3 kids, I hardly have a chance to read books, but this was a non-stop page turner and I read it in one sitting. I was extremely touched by Morrie's outlook on life and wish everyone had the same outlook as he did. I wish I had known this wonderful man - he touched a lot of hearts, including my own. This is one book that I will make my children read. By some strange coincidence, after I was done reading it - I realized it was Tuesday. Thank you Morrie for sharing this Tuesday with me."
5,Beautiful lessons of life for everyone,"A book to be cherished, a book that is making me a better person. I am conciously delaying it to enjoy it for as long as possible..! Morrie is a true mentor and this is the kind of book I would have like to have written myself, it speaks a human language, it is my feeling and approach to life written down in words that make sense. It's written like it is to be loved, like life is to be lived, to its full intensity. I plan to give this book to everyone I know and respect."
4,Very Touching,"I loved this book. I gave it a 4-star rating only because I save the 5 for unbelievable, outstanding,to die for books. This was close. Read the book;you will love it."
5,The best book I have read,"Reading good books is one of the greatest pleasure in life. It increases our contentment when we're cheerful, and lessen our trouble when we're sad Whatever may be our main purpose in reading our contact with good books should always give us enjoyment and satisfaction. One of the best valuable gifts offered by book is ""Tuesdays With Morrie"". In the book We visited a great man Morrie. His philosophy and aphorism are instructive and inspiring me. It also provided a variety of intellectual nourishment for us. It will be influence my whole life. Reading a good book makes a full man, It means that anyone who wants to be a full man must read the book ""Tuesdays With Morrie""."
5,Touched my heart,"This book was truly amazing. I usually do not read books of this sort but I wanted a change and this was recommended by a friend. The story made me laugh and cry; I never wanted to put it down. It really helped me put my life in perspective and remember what is truly important, which many people tend to forget. This book would be enjoyed by anyone who has every loved someone (which is everyone...I hope)"
4,Great Book!!!,"This book is great I really liked. It was hard to put it down, I felt specially toched by the telgram Morrie had to read to his father when Morrie's mother had past away. Morrie's memmorie will go on with this great book. I wish that I would get the great oppourtunity to meet such a great teacher. I plan to be a teacher myself and he has motivated me into being a great teacher.I recomend that you not only read but add this book to your home library!!!"
5,"moving, enlightening, inspiring, touching, loving",This is the best book that I have read in a long time. It is filled with many lessons for us all and gives us a sensitive insight into the process of dying for someone as wise as Morrie. The world would be a much better place to be if we all would take to heart the message that Morrie was giving us. I would love to buy this book for every person that I love and care about and share a beautiful tribute to a wonderful man and teacher.
2,Touching Account; No New Revelations,"This touching account forces the reader to evaluate his own life in the light of the wisdom Morrie offered in his final days. But, I couldn't help but think throughout ... I've heard this before. An effective new channel for an old message about the truly important things in life."
2,No more Tuesdays,"while the story may be a good one, i found the book slow. being dyslexic with ADD, i had a very hard time getting into the books plots and found it even more dificult to get through it. I believe, this book is a best seller simply for the number of professors requiring it to be read."
4,IT WILL MAKE YOU LOVE LIFE,I LOVED THIS BOOK....IT MADE THE LITTLE THINGS IN LIFE NOT SEEM SO LITTLE ANYMORE.
3,A short book with a reflection of a life,"There is not much in depth to the way this book was written; it is a simple written book about the reflections of a life and life lessons learned; some people need to read it in order to live it ; unfortunately some people don't get it until the end of the road; I always think that we could learn a lot of wisdom from talking to those older than us ; I hope people get the message to live, let go of ill will and forgive ; the basic message of the book. My lack of stars is mainly how the author wrote the book not the message."
3,Sarah's Thougts on Morrie,I thought at times was to sappy and not enough insight what mitch ablom was going though losing his professor. He didnot say how morrie changed the way saw his career as sports writer. Morrie was to sweet and didnot show enough of his faults. The best part of the book the important of family and friends.
3,Sweet,"This is a touching story that can be read in one afternoon, and with its feel-good tone, easy language, and brief presentation, it comes across like an issue of Reader's Digest. I can't imagine someone not liking Morrie, or the lesson learned by the author, but there's not much to the book. Take it out from the library- you'll enjoy it, but it isn't something you'll need to refer to all the time for daily affirmation."
3,Neither bad nor exceptional ( 3.5 stars),"I enjoyed reading about this touching friendship between an opptimistic old profesor, who is slowly dieing, and his former pupil - Mitch Albom. I found much of what Morrie said about the true value of life to be provoking but not much different from Chicken Soup for the Soul. This would be a rathar sentimental and sappy except I found Morrie's attitude during his last days admirable. ~15 yrs."
5,Profoundly Moving - Carpe Diem - Humor,"I started reading this book two nights ago. This morning, I read 3/4 of the book so I could finish it. Now I know why my husband, who doesn't read for pleasure too often, couldn't put this book down.The wisdom Morrie imparts during his visits with Mitch is full of life lessons we can all use. It helps to ground us spiritually and emotionally as we start this year.What a blessing Mitch Albom and Morrie were to eachother! What a joy it is to have them share their story with the rest of us. I feel that this book is a stepping stone which I will use to bring about positive change in my life."
3,Things we already know,"The book is very sweet. However if you've ever lostanyone close to you, these are all things you already should know."
5,It will touch your soul and make your heart cry !!!,"I don't remember any book that I have read which has moved me so much. I just couldn't stop crying when morrie was dying. Strange but true, we miss our mentors more now than the time when they were really there for us.The converstaions between mitch and morrie are simple yet powerful, mundane yet throught-provoking and cliched yet new to your heart. It is we, who know how much we are into this routine life of cat and mouse and how hard we are trying to break it.Morrie teaches us how to get away from the routines of your life and enjoy your life to the fullest.This book acts as a clensing agent to your soul. These books come once in an eternity. Get it and cure yourself."
4,Be prepared to be moved to tears,"I found this book utterly captivating, but I must warn readers, it is also very sad. The slow and agonizing decline that Morrie lives with as his illness progresses is described in such loving detail that you feel as if you are suffering along with him. The inspiring life lessons that the author gains from taking this journey with his friend Morrie are compelling and thought-provoking. But be ready to feel his pain as well."
5,Thank You Mitch Albom,"This book absolutly changed my outlook on life. It is so easy to get caught up in the challenges of marriage, careers and others expectations of you.Thank you for putting my outlook back into perspective!"
5,Very touching,I have never read a book that is so touching for a long time. Learning about death and treasure the beauty of life.
5,Simply Wonderful,"Other reviews explain what this book is about. All I want to say is that it is a fabulous book that has taught me a lot. Morrie is a true inspiration, and I find myself quoting him quite often.It's a fast read...I read it in a matter of a few hours. I think I'll be loaning this book out rather often as well. It was also interesting to hear a bit about what ALS does to one's body...but certainly does not effect the mind. Great find!"
4,sociology review for Tuesdays with Morris,"I really enjoyed this book. It gave me some insight to what life is really about. And I enjoyed both Mitch and Morrie's character. Morrie is some one I would truly like to meet. He so wise, loving and truly knows what life is about. The discussions he has with Mitch I truly take to heart. I think this is a book that every one should read because it makes you reflect on your life and what is truly important to you. And if you decide to read this book I encourage you too read it at the begining of your day. It will remind you about what is important in life."
5,Amazing Book!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I have two children under the age of two and I found time to read this book in two days. As Mitch Albom writes, you can visualize yourself sitting with Morrie in his study talking about family, money, culture, etc. I found Morrie Schwartz to be a remarkable man, he certainly does make one look inside themselves and take a good, hard look. I would recommend this book 100 times over, I simply can't rave enough about Tuesdays with Morrie."
5,Sincerity!!,"Having to choose a good read it is rather a difficult task than a simple one. This book has changed the way I look at the so called ""motivational or spiritual books"", Mitch has simply shared with us a sincere, moving, true remarkable relationship with his lecturer and a friend or ""coach"" as he refers to him. He did not try to patronize his readers by suggesting set philosophical ideal theories but rather shared his own personal experience and that of his teacher, which I truly appreciated as a young university student who is still trying to define who he is."
3,it was alright.,"the book was easy to read. the book was about a man who lived, got a disease, and died. i know i may sound cold hearted but the book did not touch my heart as it did alot of others who read it."
3,Tuesdays With Morrie,"spend more time with your loved ones, do the things you say you are going to do and be less materialistic. these are the lessons this book taught me. it was well worth the 4 hours i spent reading it, but a little short on the $20 i paid."
3,Tuesdays With Morrie: Overrated,"I chose to read this book for a book report because I had heard such wonderful things about it. I was disappointed when it most certainly did not live up to the expectations I had in my mind. In my opinion, Tuesdays With Morrie was a good story that was not as well written as it should have been. While Morrie does have good messages to share with readers, these are things that most people are usually conscious of, and only extremely materialistic people may need such reminders. In my opinion, this book is highly overrated. The writing itself did not do justice to the meaningful story that could have been portrayed.However, I did enjoy the story, and because it is a short book, it is worth reading. Just the same, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. Overall, Tuesdays With Morrie was an average book that I found very hard to enjoy thoroughly."
2,This book was so disappointing to me...,"I had spoken to a few people who felt this book was very inspirational. However, I've read more inspirational blogs on the internet than in this simple book. I was not impressed, but instead, disappointed and bored.Morrie seems like a wonderful person - but his student seems like someone who just was hard up for another story."
3,"Touching story, but mostly lost in Albom's re-telling","I got the impression that this book was trying to make me cry. Well, it didn't happen. Yes, the story was touching, and of course Morrie is a loveable person, but the writing is really quite dull and serves only to tell the story and nothing more. I was therefore unsurprised to learn that Albom is a sports reporter by day.I approached this book with high expectations of gaining new wisdom and insight into life, but walked away feeling that I didn't hear any ""sage advice"" that I hadn't heard before. I am assuming interacting with Morrie face-to-face would have been quite a heartwarming experience, as I'm sure it was for Albom, but the gravity of that experience didn't quite translate through this book for me."
2,I didn't find this book to be that profound.....,"Yes, I am one of the few people who didn't find this book to be the life-changing miracle that many others did. I have read a book that tells many of the exact same lessons, has sold millions of more copies, and has been published and republished for hundreds of years. It's called The Bible. If you haven't read it, I highly suggest it."
1,Self-help minus the help,"The dying old man had less wisdom to offer than your average self-help book.At first, I found myself getting into the whole teary-eyed thing. But about half way through, I was so tired of the unrelenting attempt by the author to make me cry, that the book started to annoy me. In spite of this, I read to the end, hoping for something enlightening, which was even more annoying because it never came.And if all that weren't enough, the old man's political views had to be sprinkled in for good measure. Even in dying, we have to interject polically correct nonsense?"
4,Simple yet Powerful,"Perhaps this isn't quite the classic 'life-changing experience' some reviewers say it is, but it's definitely worth reading for a glimpse at an unusual friendship. Yes, much of Morrie's 'wisdom' is simple common sense, but the point of this book is that people need more of that in their lives!I won't question Albom's motivations for writing this book, or quibble too much over his writing style(perhaps if I get around to reading more his non-sports work).I approached 'Tuessdays with Morrie' with an open mind, knowing that it had a lot of hype behind it, and curious as to whetehr it would up. It definitely did!Read it...it'll make you appreciate some of the simpler things in life!"
5,"A Most Touching, Inspirational Memoir","Tuesdays with Morrie touched my soul, helping me to understand death, dying and growing old with dignity. Mitch and Morrie shared a passionate, respectful friendship that is rare, especially considering the age difference. Nevertheless, these two men taught one another, along with the readers, so much about life, respect, getting old, and mostly, how to enjoy the little things we all take for granted.Morrie showed great courage as he slowly faded away. Through his stories, I understood what aging, death and dying is like, and how we should respect the request of the elderly, terminally ill, or those we just fail to understand.I found this book an inspiration to me, and others. I cried, laughed, mostly -- I understood what Morrie and Mitch taught us.As the author of A Condition of Limbo, I realized after reading Tuesdays with Morrie, our stories are similar, filled with love, admiration and a new understanding of the terminally ill."
1,What a disappointment,How embarrassing for Mitch Albom to have learned these lessons this late in his life. The same goes for Morrie himself. And to think they believe that others haven't is a great insult. To say that the Morrie wasn't self-absorbed is a joke. This whole book could have been broken down to a fourth grade composition and recieved and C-.
1,Tuesdays with Morrie,"The book did come in good condition. But I ordered it on Aug 22, 2010 and didn't receive it until October 6, 2010. That is unacceptable. Will not order from them again!!! I only gave it one star because I did get the book and it looks in fair to good condition. If I thought it would have taken sooo long I would not have ordered at all."
5,A much-needed aid to focus America on what we have misplaced,"In an age when everyone responds to the urging of Madison Avenue, to pursue as much ""fun"" as can be fit into a lifetime, comes a book to help us focus on what really make a difference in life. 'Tuesdays with Morrie' helps us focus on a reality that is rarely discussed: that when we reflect on our lives -- at any point in our lives -- we don't choose to focus on the number of trips, the grandeur of the hotel, the speed of the car, or the intensity of the thrill. Rather, we focus on love, on friendship, on what we have done to help others, to encourage others. On achieving personal greatness ourselves and to help others achieve their own greatness. Morrie know that all along. When he became sick, his condition allowed him to make that point to the rest of us. The world needs many more Morries. And we would all be better off by reading this book and becoming more like Morrie."
2,banal schmaltz,"At the risk of sounding unsympathetic to Morrie, I never became convinced that the process of dying provided any epiphany about living, no matter how he saw it. The book felt like a compilation of Ziggy cartoons, leaden down with banal aphorisms. I'll be curious to see just how long the author retains whatever lessons he says he gleaned by being at his teacher's side."
5,"An in-depth look at life, love, and death","Morrie was the most insightful person I have ever read about, and I was thrilled that he was non-fiction. I wish I could have met someone such as he. He possessed knowledge that most humans do not have, cannot possibly obtain during their existence. I consider myself lucky to have read this book. I especially enjoyed the chapter on death, not because it is such a forbidden topic, almost a taboo in our sociey, but because I never looked at death in that way. Morrie truly changed my perspective. I'd like to thank Mitch Albom for sharing with readers such as myself, what Morrie was able to share with him. I recommend this book to anyone, of any age-especially teenagers; I am 13, and this book literally changed my life."
5,some live more in one day than others in an entire lifetime,"I sat down in a cafe, and within 10 pages was struggling not to cry. Later, at home, I didn't struggle any more. There are more profound books, there are books that are more well-written, more complex. But it should be the simplest things in life that touch us most. Isn't that what Morrie wanted us all to know?"
4,Life's Greatest Lesson,I really liked reading this book. Someone put in their review that is really makes you think. They hit the nail on the head. As I read through this book I really connected with the characters and liked the way the story was writted. It gave me a lot to think about.
2,"""Carpe Diem""","If you need yet another reminder that you must seize every moment of life to the fullest, then this book might have a transformational, albeit temporary, impact on you. Otherwise, it is yet another person's opinion regarding what a life worth living should be like."
2,Spend Your Tuesdays Elsewhere,"Clearly, Morrie was an intelligent man who coped with his horrific illness with dignity and acceptance. Just as clearly, Albom is a not-so-intelligent man who coped with his teacher's illness with dim-wittedness and such a high degree of hero worship that he neglected to realize the obvious--Morrie's wise insights are not all that insightful. In fact, if you haven't said or been told them by the time you're 25, it's evident you've been a bit out of touch your whole life. This is a touching story, perhaps, but if you're expecting to learn life's greatest secrets and lessons, you'll be extremely disappointed. Sit on a bench in a nearby park and observe people--you'll gain a greater understanding."
2,disappointing,"I, too, had heard so much about this book, and sat down to read it on a Friday night. I found it empty, and I felt unfulfilled. The book was not nearly as cathartic as I had hoped (or heard) it would be."
2,A nice book but........,"I enjoyed the book and Morrie was a great man, but get a grip people! This tiny book says ""I tell you Mitch, you've got to stop and smell the roses"" in several ways, over and over again. Americans have really got to stop raving over this book and read something a little more challenging. It may give you a headache at first, but you'll get used to it."
2,Buy Morrie's Book,"In my opinion, it's mostly hype. It is a very LIGHT book. I wanted more about Morrie instead of the narrator/author. When I discovered that Morrie had written his own book, I wished I had not bought and read Mitch Albom's book about him. Although I have not bought/read Morrie's book yet, I would hope it's better--or at least worth the time you spend to read it, in comparison to Mitch Albom's book that should be about Morrie!"
4,A wonderful book. It's what living and dying is all about.,"I'm amazed at how many people have reviewed this book. I only expected a couple dozen. I borrowed this book from my Mom after overhearing her endorse it to friends. I'm only on page 40 but felt it was worth a review at that point. Morrie Schwartz is an inspiration to all of us, both healthy and alive and those with terminal illnesses. We don't think about death until we are faced with it up close, whether it be your own or friends and family. It's not a nice thing to think about. Morrie Schwartz faces it with courage and an upbeat attitude. This is one of the best books I've read this year. It's emotionally touching not to mention a quick and easy read."
2,Didn't even finish,"I couldn't get interested in this book. Number one because of my own beliefs about death and heaven, just wasn't matching with that of the writer. I'm usually pretty open-minded and will at least read the whole thing. But I couldn't get myself to continune reading. Maybe I will try again."
3,Fell Apart,The pages fell apart when I first opened it. Good thing I bought the movie too.!!! I guess I could have gotten a bad copy.
3,Morrie's Life,"I may sound a little cynical, but I thought the book was a bit cliche. It was touching to know that there are people out in the world who live life the way Morrie did, but Mitch Albom's style of writing and some of Morrie's aphorisms made the book feel like a Lifetime movie special. I was struck, though, by the depressing image of Morrie literally withering away and painfully dying -- Does anyone deserve to die like that? Especially one who obviously changed so many people's lives. The book is a quick read, and it's not an altogether bad book to read, but I don't know if I'd recommend it to people."
5,Tuesdays With Morrie is a page-turner!,"I enjoyed this book a lot, it's actually one of my favorite books! I liked this book becasue it made me think, because I am one of those people who keep death inside. Reading Tuesdays with Morrie makes me want to change my outlook on death to that of Morries. I don't want to dread getting old, or be scared of dying. Morrie also has an intersting outlook on life. An example on Morrie's attitude is when he was at a basketball game and everyone was cheering ""We are number one"" and Morrie stood up and yelled ""What's wrong with being number two?"" I wish I had that kind of attitude towards things, butI know I don't. This book was very well written and easy to follow. I liked the characters and the detail the author used. I definatly recommend this book to everyone!"
5,Tuesdays With Morrie is a truely enlightening book,"Tuesdays With Morrie is a heart wrenching story about the growing relationship of a professor and his student. Through the book Morrie Schwartz, the professor, and Mitch Albom, the student, talk of many things. They talk about life, love, family, society and death. Death is one of the main topics of the book because of the situation that Morrie is in at the time. Morrie is dying of ALS and doesn't have long to live. Morrie goes through this with the help of Mitch, friends, and family. Every Tuesday Mitch goes to Morrie's house and they talk about a new topic each time. Every talk they have makes the reader think. It is a truely amazing book that you have to read for yourself to understand."
4,Quick read...but a book that lingers,"I bought the paperback at the Sao Paulo, Brasil airport, waiting to return to LAX. It's a 12 hour flight, and somewhere in the middle of that flight I clicked on my overhead light and read.....and read.....and finished the book in what I think was 4 hours plus. How could anyone not recommend such a sensitive story, written in a style that is comfortable and endearing? By now, and with over 1800 Amazon reviews, you know the basics. What you will rediscover, I believe, is what you know; that a meaningful life lies somewhere between the material and spiritual world....but most probably closer to the later."
2,From another student of Morrie's,"I was also a student of Morrie Schwartz's from the late '70s into the early '80s. He was a sweet and lovely man--the kind of teacher who was more a friend than a mentor and who, I think, was always more comfortable in that less assuming role. Having known him, it is frankly hard to imagine him wanting to be anyone's ""coach"" and certainly not the archetype of wit and wisdom into which he has been transformed. Obviously, all of this has more to do with our yearnings than his own. As the kind of social psychologist he was, THAT would have evoked his interest--and his compassion as well."
4,Tuesdays with Morrie,"Tuesdays with Morrie is a great book. The goal of the author is to teach the readers that life is so much more than we sometimes understand. When we are young we take life for granted, and we do not live every day as though it is our last. Morrie is an older man who has Lou Garrett's disease, and through his suffering, and learning how to face death with a smile on his face, teaches a younger man (Mitch) what the important parts of life really are. After coming to know who Morrie is and learning what life is truely about, Mitch changes around his priorities, and his life is forever changed by his encounters with Morrie."
5,"With dignity, with courage, with humor, with composure.","This is how Morrie Shwartz described to Ted Koppel, the way he wanted to live. It seems as though Mitch Albom saw that, and so much more in his old teacher.We find Mitch at a point in his life where he is basically consumed by his career. That is, until he sees ""Nightline"" and it features his old professor. So, every Tuesday he visits his old teacher for one final class, to work on their final thesis. Mitch finds himself admiring the way Morrie used to dance with students, how when he was so sick he missed going for that daily swim. While Morrie would enjoy life, with observations such as, ""Age is not a competitive issue. Think of all I can be! I am every age, up to my own."" With life lessons such as forgiveness, and even saying goodbye. Simple pleasures in life. That's what Morrie taught. During a period in the Vietnam war, he gave all his students A's!This isn't a book you have to think about. It is beautiful."
4,Good review on Life,"I barely watched the latter end of ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" that aired on NBC a couple of weeks ago and knew immediately that I wanted to read the book. Fortunately I was not disappointed in my expectations of the book. It made very easy reading and I was done with it in a couple of hours. The professor does a good job of reiterating the good lessons in life while stating it in a very simple way. These are lessons that we find in the manual for Life, the Bible. However, the fact that someone who was facing death is emphasizing these same messages makes it even more real. He definitely helps to sum up the whole meaning of life. You must read this book!"
2,Another Amusing Aardvark,"When you flip a book open, and the first line which catches your eye is ""Before you learn how to live, you must learn how to die,"" you know that poor man's psycho babble is about to spill forth and that you should quickly abandon ship. This book has been an incredible seller for about three years, so obviously a lot of people are finding it useful, but I'm 28 years old and learning how to die isn't what I'm looking for at the moment. Thanks anyway Mitch."
1,One of the worst!,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It drags on and on with no real point. I highly recommend NOT wasting your time with this one.
5,Tuesdays with Morrie,"This is a classic! I recently lost my husband to ALS. This book did not make me sad or mourn harder, but rather took me back through the many good conversations we had until his speech was taken from him. I highly recommend it for just about anybody."
5,tuesdays with Morrie,"Its sad and cool. Its a book that wen u start readin, u cant stop. It is kind of sad too. It took me two days to read it."
3,Its More About Mitch Album than Morrie,"""Tuesday with Morrie"" seems to be more about Mitch Album than Morrie Schwartz.It claims to give lessons about life greatest lessons but it doesnt. Album's life and his commentaryovershadow everything on the insights and last days of Morrie.It is a fast reading book in that it skips around alot with flash backs, to the present and to his so calledvisits to Moorie. Album doesnt let Morrie speak for himself for he inserts his own interpretations of his owninsights that overshadow and overcome everything Morrie says.One lesson in life is to be quiet and listen, let the speaker speak and let the listeners come to their ownrelevance and interpretation of what is being said.Seems this book is more about Mitch than its about what Morrie had to say."
2,Too Simplistic,"I read all these great reviews on this site and bought the book. I expected it to be some kind of life changing/revealing experience. I did not find it to be so. I empathise with morrie, his suffering and everything but my gripe is against the author and his dull writing style. The kind of revelations the author is supposed to have got by talking to morrie are so fundamental that you dont need to have to talk to a dying person to know about them. Even simple philosophies of life can be written well. I was not terribly moved by reading about it too. At some points in the book, I even wondered if Morrie was indulging in too much self-pity. Agreed its a terrible disease to live with but the author/book just could not evoke the kind emotions in me."
3,Don't have great expectations,"I was disapointed with the book. I had great expectations when I bought it, but it did not keep me reading with enthusiasm. It is a good history, about a man that meet his old professor after several years, but the lessons are not as deep and intense as I though it were. If you are a book addicted, buy it. If not, choose another one."
1,Rid Your Home of Pestilence and Dispose of this Book.,"In my L.A class this was required reading. When I picked up this book, I wasn't hoping for much. A few heartfelt memoirs, perhaps a charming anecdote. What I recieved was pure filth, right in the kisser. It was an emotionally manipulative and a blatant marketeering of a slow, heartstring-pulling death. I learned absolutely nothing about how to live. This is a sad and pathetic attempt of piggybacking off of someone else's suffering in order to attract those in want of a tear-jerker. I find that Mitch is highly insensitive to Morrie's plight, and flew down there only when he was in need of a story. I have read many teary books as required reading, and am thoroughly fed up with this new age, sympathetic trash."
3,Yet another one...,"I've been meaning to read this for so long - unfortunately. It was very Mitch Albom, a nice read, gives you pause and makes you cogitate a little on life and of course, on death, not my favorite subject. For me this wasn't the best of his books, but still..."
5,Learning Lessons of Life,"Reading Tuesdays With Morrie was a school project. I felt it was a book that I couldn't put down. I read about things in the book that I have taken for granted all my life. And that is Life itself. I also felt that Morrie had great lessons to teach and he taught them well. I admired Morrie for his courage throughout the book. Until his last day, he was a very brave human being. In short, by reading this book, several of life's lessons can be learned."
5,Tuesdays with Morrie,"My fourteen year-old daughter read this book for her high school, 9th grade summer reading selection. She was very touched with the story and the fact that it was not fiction but a true story. Several passages in the novel caused her to view life and death in a different light."
4,A personal view of one man's exit.,"Some years ago I connected with the suicide project in Switzerland. When given the choice to linger or get out I choose to get out. PBS has a DVD on the subject entitled ""Suicide Tourist"". Morrie lingering validated my choice for me. Thank you Morrie for telling your story so I could be emphatically clear in not taking your path."
5,Life changing....,"The book is a master piece. I listened to the audio book and if you can, do the same. It is livelier than reading the book itself.After reading this wonderful book your view of the material life has not changed then..... something is wrong!"
4,"TWM IS NOT ABOUT DEATH, BUT ABOUT LIFE","I WEPT WHEN MORRIE DIED, BUT HIS MESSAGE IS ABOUT LIVING, AND DOING SO WITHOUT REGRET. DON,T READ THIS BOOK FOR ENTERTAINMENT. READ THIS BOOK FOR AN UPLIFTING MESSAGE ABOUT LIFE."
5,Best Book I Ever Read,This was such a down to earth book. Every word rang true. I could'nt put it down till I finished it. Everyone should read this book. It would give them such a positive outlook on life.
5,"Moving, spiritual and entertaining.","Wow. If you read one book this year, no matter what your age or profession, this should be it. It reads fast, but is not meant to be sped through. The book flashes back and forth between Mitch in his early days, and Mitch with Morrie, a former teacher of his with whom he has been recently reuinited. Do what I did - keep it near your bed and read only a couple of chapters a night (the chapters are only 2 to 3 pages). There is so much to absorb, you won't want to put it down. I watch Mitch Albom's news show on tv, so it really hit home to read this novel, realize it is a true story, and see the author on tv. Each chapter has you laughing and at times, crying. Either way, it will have you ""relating""...and remains one of the best all-time books of our time and any generation."
2,Disappointing!,"I don't understand the glowing reviews this book has received. Mitch Albom's writing style is unimpressive and Morrie Schwartz's aphorisms are trite. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because the book is an easy read and it does give some insight into the process of dying. It also helped pay for Mr. Schwartz's medical treatments and, for that alone, it's worth purchasing. There were several paragraphs that tugged at my heartstrings but, overall, the book failed to touch me."
2,Trite and unconvincing,"Superficial and soporific, Albom's book is strong on sentiment but weak on substance. Riddled with ridiculous aphorisms such as ""When you're in bed, you're dead,"" this book left me feeling like I had just read a high school student's unstructured freewrite. Having finished the book, I couldn't care less about Mitch Albom; more sadly, I couldn't care less about Morrie Swartz either. Because I am not cold-hearted by nature, only the writer of ""Tuesday's with Morrie"" is to blame for my apathy."
2,"""Morrie's Thousand Little Truisms.""","After reading Tuesdays with Morrie, I felt throroughly unsatisfied. The book was more like a self-help book--something along the lines of ""Life's 101 Greatest Lessons.""I think Mitch Albom had an immediate instinct to deify Morrie...not that there was anything wrong with that, but he certainly lost some perspective.I'm glad that others have found a great deal of inspiration in the book; virtually all of my friends have flocked to it as well. However, as a piece of literature, it simply doesn't stand up...it's more of a pop-culture phenomenon. I'm surprised that no one else has shared my opinion."
3,A good message but told too simply,"I wanted to like this book more than I did. What I was hoping for was a remarkable story. Something I would remember with clarity. Something that would leave me mentally scarred.What I got instead was a watered-down version of what could have been a remarkable story. The way it was told, the writing style - it just felt weak. It could have had a lot more punch, a lot more detail, a lot more heart. But it fell flat.The message to slow down, appreciate what you have, appreciate life and live a life full of love and one you would be proud of was not lost on me, so I will not disregard that. I just don't care for reading books that feel like the fangs were taken out so it will have more mass appeal."
5,Insight on life through the eyes of a dying man.,"Tuesdays with Morrie was a fantastic account of an elderly man and his views on different parts of life. It made me think of things I hadn't thought of before and it really inspired me to rethink how I spend my time and who I do or do not spend it with. It made me grateful of my family and of my closest friends and it greatly taught me how important it is to be at peace with everyone and love every chance I get. Morrie made death seem less scary and made it seem like a natural process, not sad and devastating."
3,Hope in the face of death? Maybe not.,"The obvious theme is to find what's beautiful in life and to think that was all that Morrie had going on.Ironically, I found him commenting on how he was going to die just as often as he did about how he was enjoying his last months.Yes, he did say it wouldn't bother him like it would most individuals. But really, I found his review of the situation to be as much as anybody else."
5,An Inspiration to the Human Race,"I have read ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" 3 times in the last year, and each reading has the same profound impact on my soul. Morrie's strength and courage in the face of adversity should inspire everyone to live their life to the fullest. Yes, sometimes the messages are ""cliche and trite"" as some other reviewers have said, but they are messages that the human race needs to hear over and over again. They are gentle reminders of how we should treat eachother and ourselves - with compassion, love, encouragement, hope, forgiveness, adventure, and empathy. How fortunate we are that Morrie permitted Mitch to share the ""final lesson"" with all of us. I can only hope that we aren't to cynical and self-absorbed to toss it aside. I highly suggest this book to anyone with the ambition to make themself a better person and the world a better place."
5,Nice collection of Essays,"This is a collection of ""essays"" about T.S. Kuhn's distiction between normal science and revolutionary science. Various philosophers, including Karl Popper, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend, criticize various aspects of Kuhn's argument. Finally Kuhn presents a reply to his critics."
5,If you want to understand Kuhn: buy it.,"I've been a big Kuhn fan for years. I thought I understood his ideas, too, until I read this book. This gem is a debate among some of the most interesting philosophers of science in the twentieth century-- all trying to make sense of Kuhn, most concluding that his ideas are deeply flawed.The criticism helped me advance my own interpretation of Kuhn, but it was Kuhn's reply to the criticism that brought the whole thing into technicolor 3D. I could hardly have learned more if I had the man in my living room.-- James"
4,Needs a 21st-century filter,"Edgar Schein recommended this book, so I read it. I'm glad I did. Goffman is fascinated by what happens when people engage one another face-to-face, and the essays in this book synthesize many years of observation, research and deep thinking on this topic. There is much to learn in the book, and it's even well-written and filled with interesting anecdotes that illustrate his points.However, the book was written at a time when psychologists made no distinction between the social actiions of men and women. In this book, ""a person"" is always male. It's easy to see that the book was written long before Deborah Tannen came along, and it suffers from that."
4,Goffman's Classic Theory,"This is not as profound as some of his other works, but it is important nonetheless. Goffman's understanding about interactions and how society shapes them, and learns from them, is as applicable in 2011 as it was 50 years ago."
4,Goffman is a genius,"As a communication major, I used this book frequently when I write papers and do research. If you want to know about concepts such as ""face"", you will have to read this original. But I don't think it's a book for everybody, that's the only reason I gave it 4 star."
5,Excellent Soul Filled Album,"I first learned of Dana Fuchs after seeing her band open up for herself when she was performing songs of Janis Joplin at BB King's in NYC. Dana had performed as Janis Joplin in the musical ""Love, Janis"" and she brings passion to her songs the same way that Janis did.""Sad Salvation"" is my personal favorite track on the album, an acoustic tear-jerker about a old woman who's lost her companion. There's not a bad song on the album with no ""filler"" songs to leave you disappointed. As Dana mentions at her concerts, a lot of her songs deal with either religion or addictions, which sometimes can have things in common, so you'll get a gospel feel to some songs as well as a bluesy feel to others. Highly recommended and after one listen you'll be hooked. Make sure to try and catch her in concert if you're in NYC. She's got a good webpage at www.danafuchs.com."
5,mellow sureal chill out music,"The music sigur ros makes has such a unique sound that when compared to pop music it seems utterly alien (and I mean that in the outer space sense).the whole album just flows perfectly from one emotion to another from dispair to hope to tightly held in anger right into joy. the way it flows almost makes you feel like you are being led on a trip through someones mind while they have been loaded down with heroine. I would recomend this album to any one who enjoys ehtereal, emotional and cooled out relaxing music and is tired of everything pop. What an album to dream to."
1,One word: boring.,"I found myself downloading Sigur Ros' stuff after reading positive reviews of Agaetis Byrjun from Radiohead fans. This is not Radiohead. This is not even music. If a rusty gate was to have an orgasm, it would sound like Sigur Ros' vocals. Tuneless gibberish, and it took 3 minutes for Svefn-g-whatever to get anywhere at all, and even then it sounded like an extended sneeze. ""Acheeeeeeooooooooo"". I can imagine the art school kids gobbling this stuff up. If you have a penchant for eccentric New Age claptrap, or if your sleeping pills have been failing you, you'll appreciate Sigur Ros."
1,Dismal,"Did they just unwrap their electronic instruments? Did they ask the meter reader to sit in on percussion?One can for a few minutes drift along the melancholy into the mist, rust and maudlin, ghostly moors. But when you come to you will realize it is just not good."
2,I don't want to be contrary. . .,"I tried hard to love this album, but frankly, I couldn't. Sure, the music was beautiful, but I simply could NOT understand a word the singer sang. I even recorded it onto my computer and tried to play it backwards. No luck. I'm someone who loves lyrics, words, and the message they give us. How good a song would ""I Love Candy"" be without words? Or ""Too Shy""? Exactly.Needless to say, until the singer learns to annunciate, I'll be looking elsewhere."
1,"What a scrawling, pretentious mess","As if it weren't obvious by the packaging alone, this album is the biggest load of pretentious, overrated ""stuff"" I've had the misfortune of hearing lately. Svefn-g-Englar opens the album (after a pointless, noodling intro) - Falsetto vocals over bowed guitar and keyboards? What year are we in again, 1975? Anyway, the next track opens with a string section; I think it's written law that if you put a song with a string section on it on your album, you will appear to have artistic merit. This went right out my car window. The arty kids in every local high school will eat this junk up."
1,glacial pretentious ...,Please please please save me from this type of .... this has to be the most overrated album of the last 10 years. you will need a lot of mood altering drugs to get through the album and even then it won't be worth it. i truly believe that people rave about this because they think it makes them look cool-when it just makes them look vapid. i'm sorry to come crashing down on the sigur ros parade but save your money-this is one of the few albums that i actually got mad that i spent money on.
1,Elevator Music.,"I have seen this band live and shortly after that burnt this cd for a friend. I was like ""whoa! this aint hard to make at all!""Its got a lot of ambience, more than required I think. This is perfect ""hold"" music or elevator anthems."
5,"Very moving, ephemeral music--cannot mistake this!","The first comment I wanted to make was that the review written by Maude Randwais ""my opinion is more important than yours!"" (NJ) above (with a one-star rating) should probably be ignored simply because of her comment about the lead singer ""uttering nonsense""...I would have to say that these are some of the most heartfelt vocals I have ever heard (from someone who is obviously speaking a language other than English!!). I think this album particularly reinforces my appreciation for music from other countries and must be experienced by everyone atleast once. Very moving and uniquely beautiful--definitely respectable and by far worth more than a $1 sell-off at your used record store."
5,"tasty music, ist gut, ya ya...","Well... I don't have anything terribly (or musically) pompous to say about this music, but... it does move me... and it evokes an enthusiasm in me to wanna stay up all night and listen to it... if that's not a reason to but the thing... I don't know what is... p.s. I'm very sleepy"
4,Good Stuff!,"We should probably all bow down to Bill Perez as he is undoubtedly the all knowing god of all critics. Don't mind him, he just needs a hug.Anyway, about the album. Its great stuff. Different. Trippy. Beautiful. Listen to some of their stuff first. If you don't like it, don't buy it.I rated it 4 stars because it is MY PERSONAL OPINION. It just means its great but I like other things better."
2,ok,They have a sound all their own. You know that lethargic feeling you get when you hurt and you have to run and go to the bathroom but you just can't so you crawl and it takes you forever. This is what the music feels like. Really slow and the singer or whomever speaks jibberish so... I won't even try to make sense out of this album cause you can't and please don't ask me to spell any of their singles names. It has potential to be better if they could.. put a better arrangement together.
2,I do not get it.,"I read the reviews and with much anticipation decided to see what all the fuss was about.Well musically it is pleasent the only thing I do not get is the ""made up"" language I cannot understand at which point an artist decides they will make up a language.To the reviewer who mentioned the word pretencious been used in the bad reviews, it is because it is.I would liken it to dubbing telly tubies over some old Amon Tobin instrumentals. It's a good job I downloaded it as I would not have liked to waste my money on it."
1,Garbage,"Painful to listen to, utterly inane, worthless. I'd rather have long steel needles shoved into my ears, and acid poured into my eyes, than listen to this piece of junk."
5,Beautiful,"Mainstream ""pop"" musicians tend to view their medium as more of a superficial time-killer, that is, as entertainment rather than true art. That definition need not apply to the emotion-provoking works of Sigur Ros. Most cannot understand the Icelandic/Hopelandic lyrics in Agaetis and ( ), rather, jonsi's high-pitched singing is an instrument within itself, which does not confine one's own interpretation of their music. I've spent many a sleepless night with my iPod and Sigur Ros, and it is simply mind-blowing to listen to in the dark, where one is concentrating only on the beautiful flowing tunes and letting one's creative juices flow. By all means, pick up Agaetis Byrjun and ( ). Those willing to devote some time to listening to these beautiful works will not be disappointed."
2,I just don't get it,"I bought this CD after hearing track 2 and samples of the remaining tracks. It's beautiful at times, but at others it's downright annoying. They often use a looped cymbal that is like fingernails on a chalkboard. The production seems unbalanced, with songs often sounding not properly mixed. Their use of horns tends to distract from their sound, and the vocals seem removed from the music. I was very dissappointed in this CD and will probably give it away. Look elsewhere for ethereal music."
2,"like this will change anything, but hey","Sigur Ros; Ethereal, hyponotic, BORING. Believe me, ive enjoyed plenty of albums that were similar, but this album was like staring at TV static while taking muscle relaxers. I appreciate that its not so mainstream and it is different from a lot of other artists, but jeezus cripes i cant stay awake through it! I cant distingusih songs apart, and sometimes thats just fine, but this album never goes anywhere. it just drones on like a test screen. I cant listen to more than 2 songs at a time without falling asleep, which was terrible case i was driving! If you want spacey but not so freaking boring, i suggest ""Back of Beyond"" by Frank Pahl. And no im not promoting him, just giving a more interesting option that i know of."
2,IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS STUFF TOO REPETITIVE?,"Each song seems to be one or MAYBE two kind of neat, but really simple parts, played over and over ad infinitum... A wee bit cheezy, too, methinks. Sorry, but I was expecting MUCH more."
2,"Original, tedious, pointless","Ok, they have an original sound. The lead male singer sings like a female ingenue - which is good as he does a good job of getting the maximum emotional value out of the Icelandic/nonsense lyrics (which serve as a blank slate that you can superimpose any meaning on - which isn't a bad idea, either). A few of these songs do evoke the barren Icelandic landsscape that has plenty of volcanoes, ice, and few (no?) trees. I'm afraid that all of that is not enough to sustain an entire cd. This gets tedious quickly. A lot of droning in minor chords, music that goes nowhere, etc. Yes, it is different. But if it's only appeal is novelty, the novelty - like all novelties - wears off quickly. They need more substance and less surface sheen."
4,It's YoooOOOooooooooooooouuuuuuuuu .....,"This is great background music. Relaxing, not too stimulating. Some excellent guitar textures, very subtle. Good music but rather aimless and meandering. It's really cool that they sing in their own made-up language. Ingestion of serious mind-altering drugs highly recommended for listening. Then again most people who listen to this are pretty messed-up without drugs. LOL"
5,I'm glad everybody knows what they're talking about,"I am glad that this band is receiving the respect they deserve. I've been a fan of them since December of 2000 and just got their U.S. released album. It is, like everyone else has said, awe inspiring, majestic, and a bastion of creative force and energy. I've never heard an album as good as this one and I am not quite sure I ever will. It is undoubtedly the new benchmark of 21st century post modern rock. I would keep going but unfortunately Sigur Ros' sonic soundscapes are ineffable and too surreal to limit with petty words."
5,There's a Reason The CD Has An Alien Fetus On The Front!,This music comes from somewhere other than Earth. Please listen so you can see what I mean.
4,Interesting and unusual,"i've just started to listen to ambient music and this is unlike anything else I've hard so far. I read some of the other reviews and it seems to be a CD that you either love or hate. Either way, if it can stir up such strong emotions, it's worth listening to at least once.It's moody stuff. Ethereal voices pour from a dense, dark mix like spring water out of deep rock layers, or angels singing in a mine. It's good for meditation. I found parts of it rather monotonous, but when meditating, this isn't necessarily a drawback. I like it."
3,It doesn't have to be epic,"People either seem to feel that this is a life defining record or ""pretentious"" bilge. It's neither. It should be accepted for what it is: interesting music that is original in its context. I believe that Agaetis Byrjun is a record that is best listened to while in a meloncholly or nostalgic state. Essentially, it has a purpose and it serves it well. I only give it three stars due to its limited applications, or rather, I doubt you would want to listen to this record at absolutely any given time. For me, a five star record is a record that will enhance my emotions, regardless of what they are."
1,"Good God, Make it Stop!","After reading all the excellent reviews on this album, I decided to give it a listen as I am a huge Radiohead fan. People--This aint Radiohead. This was by far the worst album I have ever heard. Check that, I couldn't make it past song 3? 4? I don't know but it was bad, real bad. Please, for the love of God, don't buy this album."
2,LYCIA ----PROJECT RECORDS,"IT'S SAD TO HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ETHEREAL MUSIC WITHOUT MENTIONING THE TRUE PIONEERS OF IT. PROJECT RECORDS AND LYCIA AND SO MANY ARTISTS ON PROJECT RECORDS LIST, HAVE FOR LONG CREATED SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SURREAL SOUNDSCAPES EVER HEARD BY THE MAIN STREAM MUSIC LOVERS OR UNDERGROUND DIE HARDS. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE MAIN STREAM LISTENER HAS PUT SIGUR ROS ON A THRONE, AFTERALL A FLOCK OF SHEEP ONLY SEE AND HEAR WHAT THEY ARE NICELY GIVEN TO BY THE ESTABLISHMENT. SIGUR ROS ARE GOOD BUT NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL !"
5,Wait...,"until you listen to it with someone you can cry with and hold... maybe it only affects highly sensitive people this way; i hope not. Everyone deserves the transcendent, emotional human experience this album offers."
5,there's something wrong and that's ok,"there's little i can say about this album that isn't written already in copious amounts, but i'll make an effort. i copied it to an md from my friend's cd while i was living in tokyo, and it really colored and shaded the subway trip to and from university in the most unique way. there is nothing like getting lost in a brilliant album and looking around at human mass. the helter-skelter, rapid-run pace of those around me was countered by the slow melodies and soaring whines. it didn't hurt that i was an alien (granted, a legal one), and the spacey feel of the music seemed to put me in my right place. the dings and chimes and sparks and moans became the beauty. gorgeous, lush (and stirkingly minimal), a full on aural experience, and one that can compliment your other senses in a most peculiar way. i strongly recommend this, especially to those who are beyond the 3 minutes pop song format."
5,Lose Yourself...for real...,"The biggest accomplishment of this album is getting me to sit through a 10 minute song and not get bored. In fact, most songs are 6 minutes or longer.Get lost in this album...I guarantee you it won't be difficult."
5,Viva Sigur Rós,"Excellent album with Sigur Rós, they really are the best and most original group around today.To set things straight, the only song on this record in ""Hopelandic"" is Olsen Olsen.. The rest is in Icelandic.You can find the lyrics at http://www.alwaysontherun.net/sigur.htmPeace !!"
2,Not my kind of Music :(,I dont get whats so good about this music - maybe the fact that i actually understand the lyrircs is what ruins it for me .I do think some songs are fine like Svefn Englar (sleeping Angels)but i prefer Björk Gumunds and radiohead . But like most icelanders im wery prowd of what they have acomplished in the music industry - they are prublubly the most famous after Björk ofcourse .( excuse my spelling )
4,A very good album that has grown on me.,"I got this album after hearing ""Svefn g englar"", which is a beautiful song. The singer reminds me a lot of Kent's singer (for example track 4), and musically this album reminds me of across between Kent's ""Isola"" and Bowery Electric."
5,The most beautiful I've heard,"Sigur Ros has never failed to impress me. This is the most relaxing, elegant kind of music I have ever heard. It literally sounds like it is something off of another planet, something like an entire new beginning - something very beautiful that you really can't explain in a review such as this. If you have not heard their music, I recommend them because you have to hear them at least once in your life to understand what I mean. =]"
5,how does a band write songs this brilliant,"i bought Sigur Ros's cd ( ) as my introduction to this great band, and after hearing that I couldn't imagine a band making a better cd, but after purchising Agaetis Byrjin, i found out that this cd is even better than ( ). Intro is just a filler song to get things started, then comes Starafur, a great song with great music and vocals. the 3rd song which i cant even come close to pronouncing, is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard, with the string arrangements and vocal melody. I wont go into describing all the songs, because for many there is no words. but i know when you buy this cd, wou will agree that is is one of the best you've ever heard (unless you listening to crap like creed, nickelback, or any pop-punk or ""screamo"" band)."
3,Whale Music,"For me, this outing really falls away after the third track into noodling and doodling with percussive rushes and jazz lines that simply don't transport. Funeral music for astronauts has been one derogative remark I've heard, and it's not far wide of the mark. The magnificent 'Svenfng Englar' had it been supported by the other pieces, would have put this work at the very heights of ambient music. It's a difficult act to follow. As it is, too much is elevator music headed for the basement. The aforementioned opening tracks embrace me with an oceanic pleasure, a submarine, floating world of dazzling colours, free of stress."
3,Get it right....,"Don't mind this album, don't hate it. Is good but not really my type of thing...One thing though.....Sigur Ros is as much a ""noise quartet"" as your mom is an 18 year old virgin....."
3,talking about good music is like dancing about art,"wow, this is the most awesome, utterly beautiful music i have ever heard. i have seen most of these songs performed live- 5 thru 8, and i have to say i have never been so impressed by anything, as someone who owns and hears an enormous amount of music. the vocals, perfect, the guitar, like a wall of onrushing sound, the percussion minimal and simple, the bass, climbing and billowing out, the strings, perfectly timed. buy this. now. or download it. it doesn't matter. get the music, find the next concert near you and GO."
4,it spreads all over the city,"I like the wait until the bridge comes. And the drawings. If you're lucky, you'll realize this isn't in English. Hello Iceland! Today I listened to this while eating soup. (2 bowls of homemade minestrone, yum. Do they eat much minestrone in Iceland?) Tomorrow I might listen to it again. Sizzle."
4,"Captivating, but a bit overdone in parts","I agree with previous reviews that the book is an engrossing mystery with believeable characters that many gay teens can identify with. The basic plot, the killing of a gay student which the police are writing off as a foiled robbery rather than a hate crime, is one that is developed well. And the ""who done it"" is unlikely to be guessed by many.The only criticisms I have is that the author goes a bit overboard in some respects, such as surrounding Killian with new acquaintances who first decide they are gay after spending a few minutes talking with him. Also, the descriptions get to be a bit hard to take in parts (like ""We walked across the emerald green grass, daffodils waved their cheery heards, and robbins hopped out of our way..."")"
5,"Sensual, Exciting, Romantic..........","Lady of Dreams is a beautiful work of art. A wonderful love story with just the right amount of tension that keeps youon the edge. Dixie's words take you inside the very life of the characters, leaving you with a lingering feeling of knowing them forever. I'm anxiously awaiting Dixie's next books."
5,Sensitive and authoritative,This beautiful edition is invaluable for professionals in the area of grief and bereavement. It is a definitive study of the the experience of loss. The simplicity and sensitivity of the author's style also makes it accessible to people who are going through the mourning process. The case studies are a helpful illustration of the principles being discussed in each section.
1,"ordered it, never got it","Actually, I never got the product. I called the retailer and they said they were going to look into it but it never happened. They still owe me this money, I just don't want to fight over it."
5,Truly Useful,"Following a series of recommended drives throughout the Middle South from west to east, this compact little book provides an excellent listing of sights (including brief descriptions) that a reasonably intelligent reader might enjoy. I read it with highlighter in hand, marking the sights that appealed to me, an approach I recommend to others.Mr. White appears to be an active bird-watcher (he apparently has written other books on that subject). Readers who share that interest will find this book particularly interesting, since he highlights the best bird-watching spots along the Gulf Coast."
1,Pretension on Parade.,This river runs deep and you don't want to smell it. The most pretentious book ever written. Listen to St. Kim pontificate. Then think for a minute. Nobody would publish her book if she didn't look like she did. Nothing in the book indicates otherwise. 213 pages of drivel.
5,Highly Recommended !,"If you are a fan of the legendary Smokey - get this together with ""Ooh Baby Baby"" the anthology, and if you're not a fan, heaven help you!"
2,Is There Room For Mystery?,"Originally published in 1907, Torrey seems ahead of his time in approaching difficulties head on. The book begins with an incredible description of where difficulties arise, with the big one being that we can never expect to understand why the Creator God would choose to do certain things in a way that may go against our 21st century, western cultural sensibilities. However, when Torrey begins to address specific issues, it seems that he falls into the all too familiar trap of stretching the facts to fit difficulties into a tidy, black and white box. When will followers of Christ accept that we will never understand all that is in the Bible - a book written 2,000 + years ago, to a culture we are unfamiliar with, and that has been translated through at least two languages to get to our current English translations. Some things will just have to remain a mystery."
3,Evolution with in Fundamentalism,"Just wanted to capture your attention. This book is an easy read. An intresting one anyhow because it captures the thoughts of Classic Fundamentalism's idea about unusual passage. More ""difficult"" back them because of a lack of knowledge concerning Creationism. Fundamentalism they say is no longer what it started out to be (for one thing...whose the they?). I must agree that is true. But if there are any changes, it is only for the better. Thanks to Scientific Creationsim we no longer need to accomodate evolutions' lies."
3,"A good example of the difficulties of literalist, fundamentalist, conservative Biblical interpretation.","The author attempts to answer what he terms ""difficulties"" with the Bible. For example: a) Is there an opportunity for salvation after we die? b) Did Jonah really live in the belly of a whale? c) Did God command Abraham to kill his son? d) Did Jesus commend the unjust steward? e) Does the Bible contradict itself? f) Does God change his mind? These questions are answered from a literalist point of view with arguments that are, to be kind, questionable. The book is a good example of the difficulties, not with the Bible, but with literal, fundamental, conservative interpretations of the Bible that fail to take into account what kind of literature the Bible contains and then equate historicity and scientific facticity with truth."
5,Sch-Wing! But no Extras.,"Sadly this double DVD feature like most does not have bonus features. However,SCH-Wing Waynes World 1 and 2 Rock. Cameos include Alice ""Were not worty"" Cooper,Aerosmith,Chris Farley, The naked Indian, jim morrison,Al Bundy. ORIGINALS! CLASSICS.Should be ON TCM. lol."
4,pretty good,"this is a pretty good double feature, i love the movies, and wish there was a third, my dvd is the same thing except at the top it says ""wayne's world collection"" and has a black background on the back instead of yellow.the quality is good. for a while i only had the second film, and that was on vhs, so thank god for this set. i got both films, on dvd, which is better quality than vhs, for cheap at best buy.the only thing i don't like is there is no special features, but other than that, this is a must have!"
4,Wayne's World=Awesome Movie!,"""Wayne's World"" is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's one of those movies where you either get it or you don't. Some of my friends hate it and others love it. I like it so much b/c some of the things Wayne and Garth laugh about and say are some things that I could see myself doing and laughing about. I think it's completely genuis. It has so many classic lines. I've seen it many times, and every time I watch it I catch something new. Fav parts are: Scooby-Doo ending, when they meet Alice Cooper, when they order chinese and say I want the cream of some young guy (lmao!), the advertisements for doritos, pepsi, pizza hut...aww hell...every single part rocks. I can't pick out my favs."
4,Extraordinary short fiction,Porter is a great writer and these stories are well worth re-reading. She can be difficult but the effort put into understanding her message is rewarded. Perfect for someone looking for a group of great 'literary' short stories to enjoy.
3,poor quality,"The netting fits the gazebo well but is of poor quality. The previous netting I had for several years, just got dirty because i left it outside, but this new one tore up within a week. I bought this one knowing it was not the cheapest available on Amazon hoping the quality would be good. Big disappointment."
2,The worst yet,"This is by far the worst Suicide Machines album yet. On this album, the band manages to combine the worst elements of Battle Hymns and their self-titled album. The album lacks the energy of Battle Hymns, or the poppy sing-along qualities of their last effort. Many songs sound like recycled versions of Green Day or Thunk tunes. For those who were hoping that the Suicide Machines would return to their roots of fun ska-punk, this album is a let-down."
3,A Little Lukewarm,"So I dont know what to think about the SMachines. This cd is ok. There are a handful of good songs and then there are some that just lose momentum. Like alot of the last CD, but definatly with a more punk style. I liked ""The Air we Breathe"" the best. They do a good cover of ""Its the End of The World As we Know it"". I liked ""Honor among theives"" and a few others, but... songs like ""All my People"" and ""Leap of Faith"" really make them look bad. They aren't very smooth and the lyrics are kinda lame. I really like Destruction By Definition the best, it has good punk songs and ska as well. It seems like it had more focus. Battle Hyms is pretty good too, but it has a few losers (most CDs do, though).If you are an Suicde Machines fan, buy this album, otherwise, get Destruction by Defenition first.And the reggae song, ""Stand Up"" blows. I like ""Give"" off of Battle Hyms much better."
2,not too good,"when i bought this cd, i was hoping for a comeback of sorts from their last cd(wasnt very good at all). i was disapointed. there are a good songs but the bad outweighs the good. the biggest dissapointment is that there is NO ska at all. there is a bad reggae song(stand up), but no real ska. its all punk, some good some awful. its sad how far they have fallen.... from near perfection to this. it is better than their self titled ""thing"" but not much better."
4,I like it,"I've been playing this cd on the radio for the last month (and I just bought it, now that it is finally in stores) and I'd have to say that it is a good album. It is much better than The Suicide Machines' last album, but not as good as ""Destruction by Definition"" (but then again very few albums, if any, are as good as ""Destruction by Definition""). I think that this cd is similar in quality to ""Battle Hymns"", but I haven't decided which album I like more, so if you liked ""Battle Hymns"" I would recommend that you buy ""Steal This Record"" because it is sweet. I hope everyone enjoys this album and if you don't I'm sorry."
4,Not What I Expected but still a Good Reference Book,"This book is very similiar in nature to First Language Lessons for the Well Trained Mind but adds a religious twist. It starts by devoting a section to learning the 8 parts of speech and goes on in later pages to tell about clauses, phrases and concludes with a glossary. I like the word origin part that tells how the English language came to be.There are a few assignments for each section which is why I give it 4 stars. I would say that this is more a reference with a few assignments thrown in for practice.If you are looking for a complete solution for a school year, look further like maybe Complete Book of Grammar & Punctuation from the complete book series.If you are on the other hand looking for reference material to teach lanaguage arts then this is an excellent choice."
4,"just what we needed, but one caution",This is a great book and we highly recommend it but it has an answer key that is not included. We had to order the answer key from the publisher.
2,Basic,It is very basic but good. Does not include the answers but not really necessary to have them at this level.
5,A MUST HAVE!,"I bought this cd after seeing La Ley MTV Unplugged (LIVE) on a spanish channel. I was just flipping through channels and a song caught my attention (I think it was ""Mentira"") and I was mesmerized by the singers voice (Beto Cuevas). I had heard about La Ley but I never really knew what his songs sound like. I don't even speak spanish but I could hear the emotion from these songs from the way Beto sings them. I love Beto's voice, it is soooo damn sexy. All of the songs are good, especially ""Mentira"",""Krazyworld,""El Duelo"", ""Aqui"", ""Fuera de Mi"", ""Paraiso"", and ""Al Final"". Theres one song (Krazyworld) he sings in French. I was really impressed by this one. I have to admit this is a must have CD for any new fans. Buy this one and you will be hooked. And it doesn't matter if you don't speak or understand spanish, you will love La Ley!"
3,con Ely Guerra?,"I love the version of El Duelo, actually, I love listening to her on it. I was happy that the song title was ""con Ely Guerra"" - yea, that must be the one. So I pay my buck and start listening. Hey! where's the Mexican chick? Damn it Jim! The download must be a different version, all I can figure. I wanted to hear Ely! Aye.3 stars, not to slam them for my disappointment (amazon mixup? or did they edit her out or what? L if I know.)"
2,Garmin TOPO! Topographical Maps (Canada),"I am checking if Garmin 010-10469-00 describes various versions like version 2 as well as version 4, but I was sold 010-10469-00 and the disk were version 2. The software sold to me does not reference 010-10469-00 anywhere. It shows 007-00564-00 Rev.B (southwest), 007-00565-00 Rev.B (South Central), 007-00566-00 Rev.A (Southeast), and 007-00567-00 Rev.A (North). I'll probably be surprised that the 010-10469-00 is for the collection regardless of revision. I meant to purchase an open copy of revision 4 that was discounted because it was opened. Buyer beware I guess and I hope I don't get lost in during my 25 year anniversary to the Rockies in a couple of weeks. The seller offered a ""partial refund"", but an unopened 2-cd version 1 sells in eBay for $39. I searched and searched for a description of revision history but came up with nothing."
5,the best,"Este producto supero mis espectativas, desde el estuche interno de cuero hasta el exterior sintetico son muy buena proteccion para el Ipod, la pelicula para protegerlo de rayones cool, etc.- La verdad lo recomiendo.-"
1,Be careful with this product,One of my patients came in to my office today with very strange looking dentures. The gum were as white as the teeth. It looked like they had been pickled in bleach. I asked him what he was using for stain control and he told me Stain Away.
5,GREAT!!!!,fast service from seller...I believe I have made a purchase with this seller for the same thing before. It's everything I wanted to be
3,Cast of thousands makes for slow reading,"The detail in this book is astonishing, but it's no page-turner. The cast of thousands makes for slow reading. Historical references and names are tossed so casually at the reader--without elaboration--I wondered if the author intended his book for historians. The dry tone is disconcerting as well."
3,Bruce Awishes-Indiana,"I just started this book, but what struck me is the authors obvious moral repulsion of slavery. He states this in the Introduction, but he repeats it so much that you begin to think you're reading about morality instead of history."
3,Scholarly but quite unreadable,"It is astonishing that a book such as this, so exhaustively researched and amply filled with detail, should not include even a paragraph on the conditions which slaves endured during their transport to the New World. In this, as with so much else, Thomas appears to assume that the reader already knows, and so chooses instead to focus on the less well-known (and infinitely less interesting) detail of the many individuals and personalities invloved in the trade over the course of its long and awful history. Thomas bizarrely eschews value judgements on the nature or morality of the trade itself; as a result his prose stlye is often dry to the point of dessication. As with his equally scholarly account of Cortes' conquest of Mexico, I gave up after 200 pages."
3,Arab Slavery?,"Sources like this are crucial, but I find the fact that the Arab slave trade was larger and more lethal doesn't get enough mention. I think people across the world would do well to realize that the West has reformed from their lesser crimes more than the Arab world has for their greater ones."
4,Nice game overall,"I received this game as a ""goody"" in a car ride entertainment bag. I was very excited to start playing the game, as I was interested in the game.Imagine Master Chef is a game where a girl named Lisa takes lessons from a famous cook, named Rachel. She teaches her how to cook different things.There are also a few twists in the game, which is nice. That way it doesn't seem like a job. It is fun and entertaining.One thing I didn't care for was the amount of events between each cooking lesson. I mean, you take a walk, you get a gift... I just wanted to cook.But most times I took a walk I received a gift for the kitchen, such as a Spatula, Pot, Frying Pan, Ladle, Rice Cooker, and Refrigerator. You can customize your kitchen, which is an exciting feature that is included.I would recommend this game to anyone who would like to learn cooking, but also have a fun and enjoyable experience."
4,Fun cooking game,"I got this game because I love to cook.In this game you play the role of a little girl named Lisa who takes cooking lessons from a cook named Rachel. You get to cook a lot of different things. In each lesson you cook a main dish and two side dishes and at the end of each lesson the other characters such as: Rachel, Lisa's mom, and Lisa's friends taste the cooking an see how they like it and give you a grade. This game also has 8 bonus games, practice for each cooking technique and it lets you do freestyle which you can cook whatever you what.Some advantages I can think of for this game is it doesn't time you like on the other cooking games for nintendo ds and whenever you save it the game gives you a percentage to tell you how much you played.One disadvantage is between each lesson there is a lot of dialouge between the characters and can get boring sometimes.Overall I think this is a fun game and I recommend it to people you like to cook."
5,Fun Game,My daughter says this is a fun game. She tells me that in the game you get to pretend to cook. You receive points on how good your cooking skills are. You get to go into town and get presents and see people. She really likes to play this game and will play for hours at a time.
3,Nice,I liked it but it ended really fast. Now i dont paly it anymore. And i bought it only a few months ago but i ahvent palyed in a really long time. Plus i ddint really want a story with it i just wanted to cook. And they didnt give me as much freedom as i thought. Sometimes they do things for you and it's just not cool.
5,Awesome,"Just installed this cover on my Ridgeline. It is awesome, fit and finish are great. Installation was a breeze. If you are looking for an economical cover that looks and works great don't hesitate to buy this one."
2,tonneau cover,"not water tight,had to order twice they screwed up first orderto expensive,if i had to buy again would go to honda get genuinehonda part.still beter than nothing"
4,Installation on my 2006 Ridgeline,"The installation of the Access cover took me about 90 minutes. I found the YouTube video [...] very helpful.I had a problem with the spacing of the front bracket on my 2006 Ridgeline. It seemed to be off by about 1/8 inch. I used a drill to enlarge the two outer holes in order to fix the problem. I also found that when installing the side rails, after sliding them into the front bracket you should insert the front bolt before attaching the rear. This will ensure that the front holes line up. I found the fit to be perfect. The side rails do limit opening of the trunk but this does not seem to be a problem for me. I would have been done in about an hour, but I spent hour adjusting the tension (this was a little of my anal-retentiveness). Overall, for the price and performance, it is a good deal. I would have given it 5 stars if the holes lined up."
2,Rails does not fit my Ridgeline.,"I was hoping it will work and fit my Ridgeline, but it came out the rails design is not good, so I have to ask for refund. Seller is pretty efficient on return process. I will recommend the seller, but not the product though."
5,Wonderful Series!,The Clarence and Smokey books are some of the funnest children's books we have found. My 7-year-old daughter loves them and has been reading them regularly for years.
4,A very informative book on historical military aircraft,"The book Historical Arcraft is one of my all time favorite coffee table books. The author describes in great detail and gives beautiful rare glimpses at 86 aircraft. The aircraft range from the wooden biplanes of the infancy of flight all the way to the vertical take-off jets of the present.The author has travelled the globe and hundreds of its aviation museums, and tells information about them including their location, operating hours, and entrance fee.This book is very informative and factual without being tedious.This book serves as a great conversation piece in my home and has greatly augmented my knowledge of aircraft.This book would best suit an adult, or an older child who likes the history and facts of war and aircraft. My overall rating=4 stars!"
4,Opera enjoyment,"Memorable stuff. The theme is grim, the composer has it exactly right; just the sort of family circumstances that soaps try to show but do little to make credible. Poor Luisa, she is doomed and Verdi leads us nicely to its terrible denuemment. The music and italian poetry is magical in combination. Bullying father dominating in every way the community he dominates, only realizing his own sullen destruction shock horror, after his son and betrothed die in front of him!"
3,Outsourcing makes this sheet crunchy and hard!,"I bought the Tiddliwinks Safari Nursery Set almost 3 years ago for my then soon to be born son. Now, his sister uses it and the fitted sheets were getting pretty faded and worn after 3 years of use. I searched everywhere and was happy to find it here, but disappointed when I received it today. These sheets look the same without touching them but they are definitely not the same. These are NOT ""soft, jersey cotton"". They say 100% cotton but they are rough and crunchy. And then, I find the reason WHY - my old sheets tag said it was made in Los Angeles, CA. These are made in CHINA. Aha! Another example of how products turn to crap when made overseas. I am very disappointed but am going to keep them because they match the set I already have."
1,"Not soft, jersey cotton as advertised","I received this crib sheet today and am returning it tomorrow. Although the tag reads ""100% cotton,"" it is most certainly not the soft, 100% jersey cotton advertised. The print is cute, but I was looking for something a little softer and warmer now that the snow is falling. I gave this item 1 star because of the false advertising, but if one is looking for a nice, regular cotton crib sheet, this would probably be okay."
5,"Soft,snug, and pretty.",Looks great with the set. Better than the green sheet. Get 2 of these instead or try the carters/tykes safari print sheets. Colors are cheery and fabric is soft jersey material.
3,good stories; no erotica,"The title is something of a misnomer: while the stories do center around the ghosts and love theme, not one of them could be considered 'erotica'. There are some good stories though (some of them previously unpublished) -- LeGuin's ""Unchosen Love""; Mary Rosenblum's ""The Gardener""; Pat Cadigan's ""She's Not There""; Maureen F. McHugh's funny and touching ""In The Air""; and Michael Stanwick's ""North of Diddy-Wah-Diddy"", about a train ride to hell."
2,somewhat ok,"item did not stay up well as it does not have a large base, display is also hard to read in the dark. I also found it cheeper other places."
2,Sender didn't work,"Unable to connect with outside sensor. Changed batteries, tried everything listed in documentation to no avail."
5,Solved all our problems,"This clock has all the features you would need in an alarm clock. The time and outdoor temperature projected in large numerals on our ceiling makes it easy to read and no more fumbling for eyeglasses. The two alarm settings and temperature readout is extremely helpful as we both awake at different times and have to dress for the weather. It is accurate to the split second and is easy to setup. We are extremely happy with this clock, and the price is right.Bob F."
2,Take a gamble,"We bought this alarm clock because we liked the ceiling projection and the indoor/outdoor temperature readings. I've been very happy with those features. However, the alarms (both of them) will randomly stop working for a few days and then randomly start up again. Sometimes an alarm will go off and we'll hit snooze and it won't go off again. We've had to get a 2nd back-up alarm and set it just in case. Annoying!"
2,Too many pictures in Blue,I learned the computer using books. This is not one of the better helps I've used. The index is far too limited for such a large program. I am totally lost trying to follow the logic in the sequence of the chapters. In a powerfully color program all those blue pictures left me blue.
5,bill L,My initial impression of this cd led me to return to amazon and purchase 2 more so that I could give them to my friends.
2,Unfortunately remixed,"The tracks from the ""Prisoner"" album are cheaply and terribly remixed. The remaining tracks are from the 60's and are left as they originally were, but the remastering of them is kinda bad. Buy this with caution!"
5,Great!,These are hands down the best wipes on the market. They smell good and are the perfect thickness. They are soft and do the job well. Pampers are the best!
4,Good,These are better than most wipes either name brand or store brand. They are very thick and easy to dispense from the Pampers pop up box. Plus the scent is nice
3,Smell too strong.,These wipes clean okay and separate from each other well but they just smell awful. I couldn't even use a whole bag. I had to give them away to someone who didn't mind them.
3,acquired taste!,"I bought this SACD on a whim because I listen to a lot of new age music, as it is very relaxing. This CD, however, was enough to put me in a coma. Double SACD, so it's like taking TWO Quaaludes! (only kidding, folks!) Excellent musician and excellent recording, however, but nothing you'd show off your system with, unless you want your friends to leave earlier than planned."
2,Not as good as the Canon Brand.,I read the product description (says it uses the same mold as the factory) and bought the product only to send it back. I found it functions the same but does not place the batteries in the same area. The batteries are placed into the side of the battery Grip. There is only one plastic door latch that holds the batteries in place.I felt it was to flimsy (for the weight of the batteries) and not the same as the canon model. The canon Grip has two catches that hold the each rechargeable battery and the door latch in the back of the grip. The Canon Grip feels more durable is more robust. The batteries are better secured by the extra latches compared to opteka's single plastic battery door.
4,decent alternative,"With no real experience with the Canon brand I find this a fine alternate. The only issues I've had are in cold weather conditions where the batteries need to be under an armpit to warm up. Not sure if this is specific to this brand or overall. But much less expensive, even with 2 batteries."
4,Best little Hoodoo Herb book on Amazon,Use this with Judika Illes' 5000 Spell book and you've got a winning combination. This edition is a great little encyclopedia of magical herbs with a few spells thrown in for good measure. A good reference tool.
3,Little or no historical context,This is a glossary of materials terms and practices. I would like to know where these ideas came from and more about their spiritual foundation. I also liked Black Magic: African American Religion and the Conjuring Tradition by Chireau.
2,Marketeered Hoodoo - Making a comback,"This book documents ""Marketeered Hoodoo"". The polluted post world war 2 Hoodoo that was controlled and manipulated and often fabricated by marketeers and sold as authentic Old Plantation Black Belt South Hoodoo. Most of what is described is taken from Hyatt and Hyatt did his documentation after marketeers had wrestled the Hoodoo market from blacks. Much of what it documents is given to Hyatt post 1930's decades after Hoodoo is and even he said that he had missed the ""golden age of Hoodoo"". The book is ahistorical and written for a marginally educated audience who know less about ""authentic"" African American Hoodoo than is presented in the book. Hoodoo evolved, the book gives no consideration to process and leaves out totally the ""viperous Marketeers"" who use hoodoo for their own benefit often deceiving blacks. A much better book is the forthcoming book from Temple University Press ""Mojo Workin': A glimpse into the Old AFrican American Hoodoo System""."
2,Disappointing,"As you can realize I was truly excited about receiving my copy of Ms. Yronwode's book in the mail. That was until I read it. Where I thought this would be more of an indepth analysis of the root botannicals used by African American slaves in their spiritual practices. Rather the book focuses on ""magical"" information much of which is culled from the author's own research. Some of her conclusions appeared to be quite a stretch yet I do find some of the information in it worthwhile. You're better off mining her website for free than to spend the money and buy this book that is unless your interest lies in ""magic"" and the supernatural."
2,A Hyatte Rip Off/Not The First of it's Kind,This book is base of Harry Middleton Hyatte( I'm not sure if I spelled that Right). The book is a complete rip off of this Author. It is not traditional Hoodoo rootwork either. The Author has flooded the web with her web site and it's all Hyattes work. What she has done is read Hyatte and claims to be a Hoodoo exspert? She has no family background in Hoodoo and even spent time in prison. A complete con. The informants Hyatte used you could never tell if they were reliable and the works are very ebonic and impossible to understand. The author has kinda filled in the blanks. The spells don't work either in her book LOL.You would be better buying magickal formular Or you could could buy some Hyatte Books and claim to be an exspert craft some oils off that after being released from prison to make a living.LOL
4,wonderful,"This is a great book. By an author with a lot of knowledge and a simple and clear way of showing it. If you are interested in Herb magick folkstyle this is superb. But one big problem is that the herbs are listed by there common names and there is no referencelist in with the latin names. This becomes very time consuming if you, like me, have another mothertongue. Also the layout could overall have been better. I still think it is a truly great book and strongly recommend it."
1,If I would of known who this lady was well...,This book is Okay. I am not a huge fan of this Lady. There are better books out there which I found out later on after I bought this. I would refer to Dr. Corbeaux on Youtube or at LuLu books than her. He is extremely more knowledgeable. And down to earth.
5,Very good resource guide,I find this to be not only a great starter guide but also a good resource to go back to time and time again. Highly recommended.
3,"Great, but not easy to use","This is a great book, but can be a pain to find what you're looking for easily. Want a love oil? You'd better be prepared to flip to each magic herb or ingredient with that property and hope it's under one of them. I had to resort to writing an index in the back cover. I now use it mainly as a secondary research book because of it's incovenience. Much of the great spells or recipes simply get lost in the book."
5,A special addition to your kitchen and table,"A beautiful serving piece that will stand up to years of use. This soup crock blends with various solid dinnerware patterns in addition to the Pistoulet collection itself. The ladle's handle has a nice finishing design touch and a ""foot"" so that it rests comfortably on the bottom of the crock."
4,An Interesting twist,"AS one of Mrs. Kurtz biggest fans, i have to say i was pleasantly surprised with the twists of this novel. With the intruduction of Dhugal as a main characters, and managing to tie him in to the ""family"" so nicely was simply amazing. I was glad to see further character growth and developement and was impressed with how they seem to be learning from each other(and past mistakes). I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys fantasy of any kind."
3,Trim Carpentry--one small problem,This would be an excellent book but for one small problem that has huge consequences: no glossary. The reader cannot get through a section of his choice because there are too many undefined terms. It's a real problem and the perfect solution is for a book of this type to have a comprehensive glossary so that the reader may choose any section to read and also have the ability to quickly find out what is being talked about.
2,Better information and free on the internet,"I find most Taunton books fair, at best. They are very expensive for the 20-30 minutes it takes to read. Many illustrations/photos in this book are small and difficult to see. (ie. making a jig for crown). There is no inormation on casing a door which the title includes. I know that it is the same as a window, however, the author does not mention this.No info on ending a moulding mid-way by making a return.No info on crown for a vaulted ceiling. I returned the book.Yes, I learned one or two things, however, the book title:""Trim Carpentry and Built-Ins: Expert Advice from Start to Finish"" is not Expert or Finish.It should be: Trim Carpentry and ?: Advice from Start .....""by Clayton Dekorne"
1,Questionable knowledge,"I ordered this book after its cover caught my attention and I read some reviews, but after reading it I returned it to Amazon. The author displayed pictures of using a table saw with the blade tilted towards the fence and ripping a board. This is a very dangerous thing to do and exposes the operator to being seriously injured. Saw manufacturers state in their safe operations sections to never operate a saw in this manner. Another item in the book speaks about wood movement. It is stated that coping reduces the likehood of gaps in mitered corners over a mitered cut due to wood movement or shrinkage. Wood does move in width but never in length. Wood cell structure takes on water as we take on calories and expand. We don't get taller when we gain weight we get wider and so does wood. Also, fine furniture mollding is never coped it is always mitered and there are never gaps during any season."
2,Professional Trim Carpenter,I have been a full-time finish carpenter for the last seven year's. I was hopeful that I would pick up some useful tidbit from the book. I learned absolutely nothing new. I guess this was a novice book.
4,Good start for beginners,"Dekorne gives a lot of insight to materials that many people are unaware of. He also shows several tips/methods that the average person would not be familiar with. It would have been nice if there more details on adjusting cuts for out-of-square and out-of-plumb joints, but the book would be very helpful for beginners. I would buy it again."
4,Finding Extra Storage Space,"I am not an innovator, have little immagination,and need all the help I can get. This book was very helpful by allowing me to find ways to utilize exixting space.Lots of ways to install trim and finish something which started out plain and boring."
3,Ok book if you don't know anything about trim work,The book did not show me anything new. It would be good for a beginner. It does have a few pictures that gave me some good ideas.
4,Awesome,It's perfect... the only thing It doesn't say to twist the bowls off so I pulled and pulled then after I got it off I realized it's a twist off. other than that it's great.
5,Bill Blass Eau De Spray from Amazon,I have used Bill Blass for years. Never will change. I just hope that they don't discontinue it. I get compliments on it constantly. I have been responsible for several friends starting this cologne.
3,Hmm,"I was given Bill Blass for women some years ago for Christmas. So I'd been searching for that scent every since, yet somehow, this just wasnt it. It's changed, or my tastes have. Not bad, but not at all what I was expecting"
5,Fabulous Recipes and Wine Too,A wonderfully written book that is organized and easy to follow without discouraging those of us who have tried to be successful with unreasonable and unrealistic diets. This book not only provides a tool for menu planning but fabulous recipes that are easy to follow and taste wonderful. All this and wine too...
5,Living Well,"In the past, as I tried other diets, I was always wary about having a glass of wine with my meal. Now, I find that I can do so and still remain fit. In fact, what Dr. Logan proposes is a life style which aims to achieve the best of health with the best of life. At last, we can raise a glass ""To your health,"" and really mean it."
3,Not overly impressed,"Some good ideas, but it just wasn't enough for me. Seemed to be lacking, you can get most of the info online if you look hard enough."
4,Solid sound,"For the last several years I have been running the entertainment center without a subwoofer. Finally decided to install one. The question was which type and how big. I had always enjoyed the the sound of my older stereo with the 12"" speakers. This lead to getting the 12"" subwoofer. The sound and feel is solid. It can be configured to any system. Also has a freq. cutoff and output level control. It also has an auto-shutoff when not in use. It has made my system sound completly different with a good low end effect. The only problem is the interference to the lower VHF analog TV channels. Moving the unit away from the TV tuner helped. Still a very good unit."
5,Beautiful Bass!,"This sub replaced an old RCA 12"" sub which sounded good at the time. Now the bass has reached a whole new level! Right now I have the volume level set pretty low because of the landlord living right below me, but when you turn this baby up my whole apartment shakes! The price and performance of this sub is unbeatable. I'm becoming a bigger fan of JBL the more I hear there speakers."
1,JBL Sub 12 Subwoofer,This product was one of the very worst I ever purchased. The main board fried up in a little over two years. The service to repair it was almost what I paid for the unit. Shame on me for nmot buying extended maintenancePowered Subwoofer
4,"It is what it is, which is not bad","This is not an audiophile-quality subwoofer, but it is a great supplement to similarly priced/similar quality main speakers. It puts out some serious low frequency energy and fills in the bottom end nicely, but it is not super fast or tight and it gets a little sloppy especially at higher volumes. With our high-end system it adds bass but it muddies up the sound, in our other system it makes a huge improvement. The cabinet is ok looking, not a fine piece of furniture, but it looks fine, with or without the grill. Definitely worth the money."
3,JBL VENUE SUB12,Received 1st damaged. 2nd one worked ok. Not that impressed with the sound. It was worth it for the sale price. Good value for basic music/movie.
4,clicking after 2 years,"I have had this for 2 years now exactly and bought if for a wonderful price in 2007. It is definitely the best SW I've heard at any of my relatives/friends places compared. But it has started clicking now sometimes and it goes away after about a minute or less. Pretty sure it will not be covered but if anybody knows otherwise, I'll be glad to hear it."
4,Really Solid,"I had to get this sub to replace a Klipsch monster. I do not have the same amount of money to throw around like I used to. But I needed a new sub. I decided on this one because of the reviews ,size and watts of this sub. Oh yeah and the incredibly reasonable price. I was expecting decent but not exceptional performance. I can say with no hesitation. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It sounds great. It pounds when needed. What impressed me the most is when the volume is turned down (that is when the wife yells at me to turn it down.) It still delivers a good punch without washing out the mids and highs of my system. Bottom line you you would be hard pressed to find a better sub for the price. I thought I was going to be disappointed going from my Klipsch to this. I am not and would recommend it to a friend."
4,LOTR finally sounds good,"I've had an 8-inch Yamaha sub for years, and it does do a nice job, but to get 30Hz you need a 12 inch woofer and a ton of amp helps. Not certain about the 500 watt power claims, but can easily pound 100 clean watts, i.e., it matches my Yamaha's 100wpc @ .05 THD.Would have preferred a down-firing design again, but in this day of MY SUV's bigger than Your SUV, it probably makes marketing sense. In a typical forward-right placement the omni-directional effect leans noticeably to the right even with a cut-off set to 50HZ. Side mounted also requires a grill, both a matter of taste and of punishment avoidance from my Golden's 200-pound tail wags.It lost a star for the grill assembly and un-typically over-stating the amp power - JBL doesn't need to stoop to that, imho. At 200bux though, it was a no-brainer - lucky for me that my 5-year-old Yamaha 8"" chose now to die."
1,Origami Flowers,I was very disappointed with this book. Folding directions weren'twell illustrated. No easily identifiable end result was shown. Veryfew flowers were included. And the layout of the book was difficult to follow. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are highly skilled in Origami to begin with.
4,Nice video,"Excelent video, very complete but need a multi cam option, needs some subtitles even in english because sometimes is very difficult to understand the comunications."
2,Uselss until Your Child is Preschool Age,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me since I have a ""spirited"" baby and she has two spirited children. I have two main issues with it.First of all, while it is a nice book, it was completely useless to me, with a baby. None of the advice or information applies to a baby.Second of all, this is geared more towards people who feel like they are the only one with a spirited child. It's more about helping you feel like you're not alone. That's not really what I was looking for or expecting. I was looking for a resource in helping me deal with my spirited child. This wasn't helpful in that sense."
5,saved my sanity,"This book is worth every penny! Mary Sheedy Kurcinka wrote it with my child in mind. I was so overcome with relief that someone finally understood my child that I cried throughout the book. Everyone says my kid has temper tantrums, but I never thought anyone really understood what life was like in our house. People always thought I was exagerating until they would witness some outbursts. Our timeouts were ineffective and things only were getting worse (our child is 3). Then we read this book and not only found more effective ways to discipline, but have gotten to a point where we rarely need to discipline. Just understanding our child's temperment has made a huge difference in our lives.If you read the subtitle and said, yes, yes, yes, this sounds like my child then you NEED this book!"
5,A good read that relates to Sensory Processing Disorder,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, this book is simply the best. It does not use the term Sensory Processing Disorder but every single word will apply. It may very well become your lifeline."
3,A good read...however-,"Yes, my husband both agree we like this book. However, all we really came away with is the fact that, yes, we definitely have a spirited child, but there were really no techniques or strategies that we could find to deal with daily tantrums/meltdowns. Basically, the book validated what we already knew.The few 'techniques' the book did offer had NO effect whatsoever on our child.A good read though...."
4,Helpful guideline for those with challenging kiddos.,It is good as a guideline book and to reinforce that you aren't doing anything wrong and you are not alone. Really good tips.
1,Great book if you want to give up,"This book is great if you want resign yourself to living with your kid's tantrums and other unwanted behavior. You will feel good because you are being told it's not your fault.If you want something that actually works in reducing unwanted behaviors, try an evidenced-based parenting book like one of these:The Kazdin MethodIncredible Years"
3,"Sensory Processing Disorder, not Temperament","What this book is describing is right-on but the author is attributing the behaviors to personality, temperament. What is actually being described is a medical condition: Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD). Some of the techniques in the book may very well work with children with SPD but by not correctly identifying it as a medical condition, a parent may not seek the medical resources that are available for SPD (i.e. Occupational Therapy), other resources and home therapy techniques."
5,Fabulous book,"This book is TREMENDOUS! I've learned so much about my 10 year old daughter who is ADHD. There are hundreds of helpful small, easy to handle tips to help me as a parent. I have 3 daughters and have actually been able to use these tips on each one of them in different manners. I am constantly looking for ways to better parent her, and this book is full of GREAT advice."
3,"Way too wordy, but a few very good points.","There were very nice point the book was referring to. But it is more like a novel than a parenting book. The author has written a novel, she is too talkative and takes for ever to say something. The whole page 240 could be summarized in one sentence. Examples are ok and at times necessary to clarify a point, but she is constantly telling stories. Not examples. Once one elaborates too much, it turn to stories! Way too wordy for me. Unfortunately I could not pass page 240 :( . I hope the author will consider editing her book, for she has good points."
5,"Fantastic, Extremely Helpful Book!","I knew my daughter was spirited before I read this, but I still learned a ton about her. And discovered along the way that I also am a spirited child :)"
5,definitely worth reading,"Generally I'm not into self-help and how-to books, but this one is giving me a lot of insight into my children and my relationship with them. It's already been very helpful, and I've only read the first few chapters so far."
2,"Good information, painful writing style","The writing is terrible, and muddies up the author's point, but she does have some helpful offerings. It seems very much geared to the spanking, McDonald's feeding set, so if you're into attachment parenting and don't feed your kid crap, you feel a little sidelined. I sincerely hope Burger King and McDonald's paid her for every time she pimped them as part of a reward system for kids.I mostly took away from this book the following:I cannot change my child. Raising her will be harder than my other child. I can empathize more (hello, Art of Happiness) and I can predict her to a point and try to keep her level and in charge of herself. If I do this right (with lots of Happy Meals when she's good!) then I will one day have a young adult who can manage her own energy and emotions. But probably not her weight."
5,a must have,"This is a great video for anybody looking for tips, knowledge, or possibly building a worship for your team. I have been singing for 10 years and found this DVD to be very helpful for me and a lot of what I learned I now share a lot with my team. It is definitely a great tool to have in your resource library."
5,This book helps me know myself and my family.,"I like to read this book once a year to remind me who I am and where I came from. I will never again be critical or ashamed of my rural mothers'and grandmothers' ways. I always feel like crying after I read this book--tears for their toil and for the disrespect society dealt them, but mostly, I cry a little for myself, too. I regret that I can't sit with them all around the table and hear their stories anymore, and I wish I could pile in the car like Shirley and her cousin to ride out to the cemetary to tend the graves. Abbott's story was familiar to me from the first page. I appreciate the opportunity to remember my maternal ancestors--the poor, white, uneducated, transient,hard working women of the south"
1,Different songs on CD than advertised.,"I requested this CD and when I received it, the title was the same but all the songs were different. DON'T ORDER THIS CD!! You won't get what you ordered."
1,Most tracks are NOT the original versions!,"Whenever I purchase a various artist album on cd, I expect EVERY track to be the ORIGINAL version that I have always heard on the radio years ago. I do NOT want any of the tracks to be ""new stereo recordings"" even by the original artists. I am sure that a lot of people feel this way too. This particular cd contains only 3 original versions out of the 16 tracks present. All 13 of the other tracks are REMADE by the original artists. For anyone who is interested, the 3 original tracks are ""The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia"", ""Show And Tell"", and ""Precious And Few"". I had to purchase this cd from a marketplace seller since it wasn't available at Amazon. Fortunately, it didn't cost me much, but I still regret buying it even though I didn't know there would only be 3 original tracks on this cd when I ordered it."
2,CORRECT TRACK TITLES,"1. Midnight at the Oasis - Maria Muldaur2. Love Won't Let Me Wait - Major Harris3. Love I Lost, The - Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes4. Patches - Clarence Carter6. Hey Girl Don't Bother Me - The Tams7. You Little Trustmaster - The Tymes8. Something Old, Something New - The Fantastics9. Do It Any Way You Wanna - People's Choice10. My Baby Loves Lovin' - White Plains11. Beg, Steal or Borrow - The New Seekers12. Do You Wanna Dance - Barry Blue13. Let's Get Together Again14. I Can Do It - Rubettes15. In Zaire - Johnny Wakelin16. Baby Jump - Mungo Jerry17. Fox on the Run - Brian Connolly18. Pepper Box - The PeppersONLY TRACKS 12 & 18 ARE THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. ALL OTHER TRACKS ARE RE-RECORDINGS."
2,Disappointed,"I expected more after reading the reviews. From someone who has very stressful employment, working on a computer much of the day, where on earth does this ""therapist"" suggest that imagining myself sitting at a computer hitting a ""delete"" button to get rid of my stressors and anxiety is anything that's going to help? It is in fact the LAST thing I want to imagine myself doing when I get home from work. Not for me."
4,Didn't experience a thing until... I fell a sleep about half way,through the first time listening. very relaxing. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,It Works.,"When I first listened to the 9 minute introduction, I was bracing myself for a disappointment. Ms. Miles voice sounded a bit harsh and not the soothing tone one might expect from this type of product. On the main track, however, her voice is more pleasant, though still not especially soothing. Another reviewer mentions that there is a certain repetiveness to the track and this is true. However, the repetiveness seems to work very well, at least for me. I have had much deeper relaxation and self hypnosis experiences with this CD than some of the others I've tried. I highly reccommend it."
2,Less than relaxing,"I'll go out on a limb and give this its first less than stellar rating. I found it excessively repetitive, and nothing personal but Ms. Miles' voice would not be my first choice for a relaxation cd. This is the first relaxation cd that my wife told me to stop listening to (for similar reasons)."
4,listen to in hottub,I get into my hottub and turn this on and just float away into pure relaxation. Its like a meditation and stretching session for myself.. :)
5,Incredibly effective!,"This is the best relaxation CD or tape I've tried. The best part for me, because I'm terrible at visualization, is that Kimberly Miles doesn't try to force you to visualize complex or difficult to imagine nature scenes that may or may not be soothing or relaxing. She starts with simple muscle relaxation and then basically just commands you to start relaxing deeper and deeper and, amazingly, it works!"
5,Worth a try,My grandson has a hard time getting to sleep so I bought this for my daughter to use. Good Luck
2,MY GRADE: C minus.,"This one lasted for a half hour before I tossed it out and no, contrary to what the trolls say, it's not my job to watch something that is boring before grading it.The biggest problem? Too British and too talkie with not enough happening.Tale focuses upon the rise of the British media during the Suez Crisis.WHEN WATCHED: early October 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C minus."
5,A touching tale about a young girl and an old legend,"Although I read and reread all of the author's Betsy-Tacy books as a child, I had never heard of ""The trees kneel at Christmas"" until it was rescued and rereleased by Abdo and Daughters several years ago.The story was inspired by a legend the author heard from a Lebanese immigrant woman while living in New York. She kept the legend -- that the cedar trees in Lebanon kneel down at midnight on Christmas Eve -- in her mind for quite some time, until a visit to a local school matched the face of a young girl with the story.The story is told quite simply and timelessly. Young Afify hears the legend of the kneeling cedars from her grandmother and wonders if the trees kneel in Brooklyn, too. The remainder of the story follows her as she sets out in search of a miracle."
1,I was sent the wrong doll too,"The doll pictured when I purchase the item was of an awesome looking mohawked little guy with ""no future"", instead I received a girl doll in a pink tutu, pink butterfly wings,& red rings around her eyes - not what I was expecting at all! Thus, I was not happy too. This would be a fine doll if it was the one pictured & you expected... the doll did arrive promptly & in original packaging that was in good shape."
4,DVD Information from the producers of COPS,"Amazing Video Collection: Incredible Rescues features footage captured by camera crews tagging along with paramedics, firefighters, and other 911 response units. This video is part of the Amazing Video Collection series from the veteran producers of Cops, the godfather of ""Reality Television"" shows. Drama has always sought to create emotions vicariously in the audience by staging situations. Reality TV has captured the imagination of the viewing public precisely because the stakes are real and not imagination; producers love the genre because it's genuinely dramatic and inexpensive to shoot -- it's literally ""cheap thrills."" Boasting ""no reenactments, no actors, just real-life heroes,"" this program's highlights include rescues of real people trapped by fire, stranded by floods, clinging to the edge of a cliff, and buried alive."
4,A Must for an Erasure Fan,"Way much better than their POP 20 release, this includes all the hits from when they began in the 80's, plus it has a second disc that includes rare videos, live perfomances, and interviews with Vince and Andy. This is a DVD that any Erasure Fan should have in their collection. Almost a 5 star rating, but I only wish that they had more live performances and chapter selections in the interviews"
4,Menus could use some help,"A comprehensive collection with some good extras, including their first performance on ""Top of the Pops."" A must have for any Erasure fan. However, the UI/navigation on this DVD sucks. Using pink type w/ white rollover, you can hardly tell which one you're selecting. Once you select a video, you can't move to the next one without having to go back to the menu. Was ready to throw my remote out the window. Someone needs to go back and revisit their iDVD tutorial."
2,Wished I could have loved it.,"These bino's are small compact and lightweight. Unfortunately, due to the small diameter opening of the lens, they are very dark in all but bright sunlight. Not very helpful if you are using them in an Arena or Stadium indoors, at night or on a cloudy day. Also for me, they never seemed clear. Everything always looked a little cloudy or fuzzy. Never super sharp. The magnification was great, but for their small size, any movement you have, is also magnified in the bino's. I think you can find better for the price. Just my .02"
2,disappointed,"I purchased these binoculars due to the zoom and Carson's great warranty. The binoculars were defective as I could not make it so I could see only one circle when looking through the eyepiece. I contacted Carson multiple times over a two week period to get a replacement pair. Each time customer service informed me the person in charge of warrantys was out. After leaving multiple messages I have never received a call back after several weeks. I ended up returning the binoculars to Amazon, which was great with the return process."
2,Dont put it in your pocket and walk around!,"Great Binocular and it actually works, but if you leave it in your pocket and walk around, the pieces will start to fall apart! I glue the pieces back, but now the focus doesn't work..sigh...frustrating....Guess this is what you get since the product was made in China. The true value should be $10, not 20 bucks. Buyer beware, poor workmanship."
4,Very techy,"This was a good read for someone who hasn't had a compost in about 20 years. They book does get a bit technical, but that seems part of composting. It goes into detail about microbes and other conditions. I will keep the book around for a reference."
5,Clever title,This made a good gift for my dad - I am trying to get him to try composting!! It is a good book.
4,Stinky subject good book!,I bought this for my husband as he went crazy on composting. I read it as well. And it provided more info. A must read for anyone wanting to start or even seasoned rotters. Good book to leave on the table gets lots of funny looks
4,good basic info,"This book is a very good introduction to composting. However, I got interested in doing the worm castings and there were only one and a half pages with no detail on how it's done. Overall, a good intro."
3,eh...,"This book was ok. I like that it tells you what you can and cannot specifically compost. It also has directions in case you want to build a compost yourself, along with the various types of composting styles used.If you're only interesting in the essentials of composting, I did find a .pdf file that was extremely helpful. To locate it, I searched : essentials of composting guide and selected the link from the City of Davis.But the book is rather handy if you need to reference something right quick."
1,Useless Detail,"I am a beginning composter and wanted a ""how to"" guide that was direct and functional. This is not it. The author spends too much time expounding on details that have little functional application. One wonders if his ojective is to impress the audience with the extent of his esoteric knowledge and intelligence. Indulging such ego needs at the expense (and waste) of the readers money and valuable time is a disservice. Additionally, it makes the topic so complex as to discourage the public from composting at all. Save your time and money - buy a more direct guide to composting!"
5,nothing rotten about this book,"I've been composting for about six months, as a completely ignorant amateur. I just piled up all of my lawn trimmings and vegetable kitchen scraps out next to the garden - it worked, but I needed to know more.Who knew I knew so little! I was avoiding putting things in my pile that belonged there. Layering, turning, components- I am now so ravenous for compostables I look at everything around me, and wonder how it'll rot.If you garden, you should compost. If you don't garden, you should compost. Early in the book Stu Campbell delivers the startling fact that you can cut 35% of your homes garbage weight, merely by composting. To relieve the burden you place on the planet, for that reason alone, you should do what you can.If you're investigating permaculture- a compost pile is a necessary part of your home ecology."
4,Good basic information,"Sadly, composting has a bit of a bad reputation some places. Many people imagine that you have to wear Birkenstocks and take part in anti-globalization marches, grow your facial hair and bathe infrequently to compost. Nothing could be farther from the truth!According to most gardeing experts, amending one's soil is just about the most important thing one can do to ensure the health and beauty of a garden. Composting can be an inexpensive, quick and simple way to improve the soil, and it cuts down on the waste taken off to garbage dumps.Let it Rot! Gives clear, well-written help on understanding how composting works, how you can set up your own composting system, and pitfalls to avoid. After you follow the instructions and see your garden blossom as never before, you'll understand: You don't need to be a hippy to compost your scraps!"
4,"Book: "" Let It Rot!""",I have read most of the book and so far I find it informative. I would recommend it to others to read.
2,Realy isn't all that great.,"This movie isn't all that great. The story is hard to follow, and doesn't make much sense even if you've played the game. The aminamtions are really good, but are a bit off sometimes. The humans look stiff and movement at times doesn't really look all that great. I also hate the fact that the movie wasn't in HD. The copy I was received was in 480p. Overall, I really don't recommend buying this. Whatch it somewhere else for free."
3,not worth it,the best fight scene or like nearly the only scene worth fatching is the final battle. good battle though but that is it.
3,Mishima Clan Battle Royale!!,"This film takes place between Tekken 5 and 6 and basically informs us on how Heihachi returned to the tournament. The cast of characters is short, and the story focuses on the Mishima clan, but the fight at the end is well worth it. if you're a Tekken fan this should be in your library."
4,Nicely Graphic Movie But...,"I love the 3D graphics, realism, characters, locations, and so. Like everyone else, I would find this movie interesting and worth watching at first. But, when you see the plot, nonsense (e.g. Lee's catchphrase ""Excellent""), irrelevance of some things, and limited characters from the entire Tekken series, you realize that this entire movie is just incomplete. It is supposed to be much better than the real live action film ""Tekken"" made in 2010. But, it is honestly no different than that lousy and previous one (Jin and Christie are a couple in that movie but they are not even friends in the video game series.).Tekken HybridTekken Tag Tournament 2Tekken 3D Prime Edition"
2,Don't bother,"Positives:- I thought the CGI was quite good all things considered. If you really like CGI, it's probably worth watching just for the eye candy. The facial expressions are a little robotic and they can't seem to do wet characters (people standing in the rain, looking perfectly dry for some reason). But overall, good I thought.- Voice acting was good.Negatives:- The plot is so ridiculous you give up trying to follow it about 15 minutes in. FFVII Advent Children had a much more cohesive plot by comparison.- For a fighting movie, it's more than 50% teenage girl angst. No joke. Fight scenes are ok, but not as good was I was hoping.- The ""lesson"" is really heavy-handed and trite. Humans shouldn't fight each other. Revenge is destructive. Respect the earth. Etc.Verdict: This is a straight up terrible movie. Unless you're really bored, or really love CGI, don't bother."
2,Journalistic Efficiency Triumphs Over Substance,"I dearly wish that the portrait of my father, Simon V. Weiser, were more accurate. To latch onto an insignificant fact and make it the centerpiece and title of the portrait perhaps made the reporter's job easier, but did not do justice to my father's life."
2,Awful audio quality on instant video version.,"The movie is great, but the audio on the instant video version of the film is just terrible!Does anyone actually listen to this stuff before they put it up?"
3,Condition issues,"The dustcover had a small rip, which wasn't a big deal. But I didn't expect the book to have a sharp dent in the front cover. I loved re-reading the Ripley trilogy, but was disappointed in the condition of this particular book."
2,Repugnant Ripley,"If Patricia Highsmith would have her way in the Talented Mr Ripley then we are expected, as readers, to accept that the Italian Police and all the ex-patriot Americans really are quite a dull lot. How come they couldn't work out the deeds of this dirty little sociopath and figure out what Tom Ripley was up to.I don't want to spoil it for anyone but the last six of seven actions of Ripley and discoveries of the police, in my view, point right to Tom Ripley.By the end I just wanted it to be over. Film was superior if only to have a glimpse at Mr Ripley's rear end as portrayed by that kid from Boston. What is his name again?"
4,Mystery as Literature,"This compilation was bought as a gift for a friend who is a mystery fan. I read them in the 1980s. To my mind, Highsmith is in a small group of mystery writers who can lay claim to writing literature, not just genre material. Simenon would be in such a group, perhaps Hammett and Chandler at their best.Some reviewers fault the ""character development"" in that there does not appear a strong motivation for Tom Ripley's crimes. This to me is a strength of Highsmith. Evil, as Hannah Arendt showed, is banal. Ripley is not banal, but neither should we realistically expect horns to grow from the heads of the evil, nor a simple single explanation for evil acts. Tom Ripley is self-interest at its reductio ad absurdum."
5,The Talented Mr. Ripley,"i read the book after watching the superb movie...another -more and than words can express- excellent acting job by Matt Damon. I LOVED the book and ran out and read the next in the series. Ripley is the criminal that you know you should hate, but love instead and I actually felt guilty about loving. he commits murders out of necessity and gets away with them in highly tense situations. The entire time i was reading them, I kept repeating in my mind...""DON'T GET CAUGHT...PLEASE, PLEASE."" I loved them. It reminded me of the murderer in ""Crime and Punishment"" - though I can't remember his name at the moment."
4,Well written,"The novel is well written and I enjoyed reading it. I think the story has something very extravagant and is, psychologically seen, such a great work of art. The story is interesting because of the variability of the different people. The different characters are well constructed but in a way not as realistic as in the book.Tom Ripley is a man with too high ambitions but he can't realise his dreams so easily in this world.I think the aspect of seeing through the eyes of the protagonist is nothing special but through the eyes of a criminal. It's very interesting and a great challenge not to lose sight of the right side of life and the importance of the relations between important and true friends. In a way the story aims at the global world constellation because of the relations among the various points of power in the world, like the ""good"" and the ""bad"" people or the way how you succeed in your life.But altogether it's a thrilling story which I can recommend to read."
2,So many ways to improve,"(...) It is pretty straight forward and easy to understand, BUT there are no answers for the exercises in the back of the book. My professor never asked us to turn in exercises from this book so the exercises were useless since there was no knowing if you'd done them correctly. If there were answers in the back and a companion CD with examples I would keep the book, but now that my class is over I'm taking it back for 1/2 of what I paid for it and counting my losses."
2,Pius the 12th silent?,"This book claims that Pope Pius the 12th and the Catholic Church, for the most part were silent during the Holocaust. In a way that is true. The Pope learned early in the war that to speak out against the Nazis only brought about more severe retributions. Even leading Jewish clerics warned him not to do so. Instead he acted behind the scenes to save the lives of Jews, Gypsies, and others. He ordered Vatican buildings,convents and monasteries to hide and protect these hunted human beings from being slaughtered to the best of his ability. He ordered false baptismal and Communion documents to be printed up and given to these oppressed people. He even provided money and gold of his own to purchase freedom for some. Lets remember that the Vatican itself was an occupied country during the war. The fact that the Pope and the Catholic Church saved as many as 800,000 Jews during the war speaks volumns in itself.Would that the rest of the world had been as silent."
3,"Dry, Dry,Dry","If you are looking for facts, this book is what you want.I am a lifelong WWII history buff and I have read many, many books on this subject. I didn't think it was possible to write a boring book on the Holocaust. I was wrong. Dwork succeeded.The facts are there, no question. In fact, you'll get an avalanche of factual information. But it's presented with about as much feeling and emotion as if the writer's subject was plastering a ceiling. It's hard reading and by the latter part of the book I was slogging through it and thinking longingly of the fascinating books on the Holocaust that grab you by the throat and don't let go. Not this one. I was glad to put it down."
1,What are they thinking?,Just one question. Where are the designs and colors for the International Market? The author should travel to all the destinations to explore and compile all the colors and designs before writing this book.
4,A Great Hodge Novel,"This is the third book in the Purchas/Purchis saga.Little Caroline is born to a mother who leaves her to be raised with a vicar. As she grows, she realizes that she isn't a part of that family. When her foster mother goes insane, she is sent to live with a Duke and his menagerie of children. Little does she know that she is actually his daughter.This is one of my favorite Jane Aiken Hodge books."
5,Laurel and hardy Comedy Classics Vol.1,"This is a nice group of shorts, whether you are new or a long time fan. Music Box is a classic which is about the boys hauling a piano up a long flight of stairs. County Hospital has Stan visiting Ollie in the Hospital, getting him thrown out , and has a very funny driving scene at the end. In Twice Two theboys are married to themselves in drag. Live Ghost starts with the boys trying to make a few extra dollars by helping a sailor shanghai some men to work on his ""ghost ship"" , and ends with the boys with their feet heading south and their heads facing north. I found it to be a delightful mix."
5,4 good L&H short films,"This has 4 good L&H; short talking films.The Music Box is one of their best. The boys are faced with a small problem. Delivering a piano to a house on top of a hill. Upseeming endless stairs.County Hospital finds Ollie in the hospital with a broken leg. He is having a nice quiet rest until Stan comes to visit. In thewake of Stan`s disasterously innocent visit, it`s a true wonder anyone survives.The Live Ghost finds the boys on a ghost ship. The action really starts when they (mistakenly) believe they have accidentlykilled one of the crew.Twice Two is the weakest of the 4 films. But even this one has some very good laughs in it. L&H; play dual roles. Theirselvesand their own sisters in drag."

5,Great for Adrenal Support.,"I've used this product on and off for years and it is my favorite licorice product. Licorice helps to extend the life of your own natural cortisol (or any that you take) and also has aldosterone-like properties which help to expand the blood volume and increase low blood pressure. In the right circumstances, this product can really be a positive addition to an adrenal program."
4,Dottie West - Country LegendsI was making a,I was making a DVD in memory of my sister for my neices and this album had two songs on it that said what I wanted to say in music. Just what I wanted. The old ones are the best!
4,Well Done!,"If you are familiar with this series, you are probably of the same opinion as I am that the quality of the presentation, the depth of the topic discussed and the ability of the professor to engage can vary widely from topic to topic. This is certainly one of the better in the series. The material is reasonably comprehensive for a general review and provides useful rules and tools for identifying and analyzing tpical exam issues. Professor Goode's presentation is light enough and engaging enough to keep you awake. Surprisingly well done!"
2,It's not really a DVD...,"What I mean by that is... it's a DVD-ROM. It does not, repeat DOES NOT, play in a DVD player like one might expect when ordering a DVD. For this title, you must insert it in your computer and watch quicktime movie files on your computer media player.As such, I cannot comment on any of the content of this disk... I haven't been able to watch it. Shame on me... maybe there was some fine print on the order screen that I did not see... when I ordered a DVD, I thought I would receive a PLAYABLE DVD that would work in my DVD PLAYER... get it?Ultimately, the content may even be great... someday, maybe I'll actually get to see it and figure that out for myself. It's just that what was delivered to my mailbox is not what I expected or what I wanted.Just for information and comparison purposes, subsequent volumes within this series (Volumes 2 & 3 specifically) ARE playable DVDs and DO work in a DVD Player... as I would expect... and in accordance with what I wanted and ordered."
3,Not very thorough,"This is very limited. It makes some of the words more confusing; instead of pronouncing a word as a whole, it puts too much stress on phonetics."
4,Guia inteligente para creyentes cristianos,"Yo lei este libro hace un an~o. Contiene discusiones y informacion util sobre todo que existe-la cultura, la filosofia y religion, la condicion de la iglesia de hoy, la ciencia, la educacion. . . Es un libro muy pensativo y inteligente."
1,"Don't waste your money unless you really are a ""Dummy""",After reading the first few pages of this book I wasn't sure if the writer was pro- or con-Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition. It seems like all he did was tell the reader how bad a product this is. I didn't get this book to read about one persons opinion of the product. I got it to learn about the newest version of Visual Basic and its newest features. All the writer does is tells you all the bad things about it. He claims to have written many books on the subject but he doesn't even know what IDE stands for (see page 23). There have been many times I've thought about tossing this book in the trash but it's gotten pretty amusing at times to see how bad the author is at this subject. I have to admit that all of the book is not bad - he does explain some of the new features but overall I'd stay away from this book at all cost and invest in another book either from Wrox or Microsoft Press
1,Don't buy this book,"The author is mainly interested in slamming Microsoft and object-oriented programming. Unfortunately, he never gets off this soapbox and gets around to teaching anyone how to write a complete program using VB Express. A complete and disappointing waste of time and money. I will most certainly avoid works by this author in the future."
2,This book is for VB6 users,"Buy this bookIf you are1) VB6 users2) VB enthusiasts3) old age VB fanatics4) never care for C/C++ or Java and want to stick to Visual Basic onlyElsenot recommended....If you simply want to learn the new user interface of VB8 (Visual Studio 2005 version) and see what you can do with the upgraded ToolBox items, I recommendVisual Basic 2005 Express: Now Playing (Book and CD edition)Wallace Wang explains much better about what VB2005 version can do without unnecessary information."
1,Author Should Stick to VB6,"It's truly unfortunate the publishers could not find an author to write this book who was not still mourning the demise of Visual Basic 6. It seems every page contains some reference to the needless complexity of the .NET framework or OOP practices. Since Visual Basic 2005 is an object oriented language based on the .NET framework, it would have perhaps been more appropriate to have a book written by an author familiar and comfortable with these modern programming techniques."
2,good title and index,"I have to say that I bought this book because of its cover, title and index. Actually, it has lots of short stories describing different dogs and their families' daily lives. I don't think it is worthy if you want to learn how to train your dog, or understand your dog's way of thinking. All of those stories are too simple, full of human emotions without insightful analysis."
5,The Laws of the Golf Swing,Finally a book that takes the mystery out of the golf swing.After hours of wasted time on the range and numerous books this book is the definitive on the golf swing based on sound laws of physics as they relate to the individual's body characteristics and the execution of the golf swing. If you have the patience to understand the principles and apply them you will be soundly rewarded not only with fine golf shots but the joy of understanding which is for me the most rewarding part.
2,Did I read the same book!,"I thought this book was very, very difficult to follow. There are not enough photos for the descriptions that the author tries to portray. He explains how to grip the club, but doesn't have a photo to show you exactly how to do it. There are practice tips in the book, but again, photos are missing. Also, trying to follow the body type test proved to be a challenge. There were several details left out and I ended up guessing on what the author meant. Again, a person cannot rely solely on the text when learning something so physical as golf. Even Ben Hogan stuggled to match the text with pictures(5 lessons). A person (a least me) requires a lot of photos to understand exact positioning of hands, legs, feet, etc..This book gave me some things to try, but it is not the ultimate golf swing book as far as I'm concerned. I don't think that Mike Adams revealed any hidden secrets."
4,Finally something different on the golf swing!!!,"I loved reading and will go out this weekend and start working on an arc style swing. I'm a tall flexible guy and never could understand why it felt so difficult to achieve what some pros would be trying to get me to do. Thinking back, most of my teachers were, by chance shorter than me. The authors explain that different body shapes require different swings and they tell you how to get to a swing to suit your body. I could relate to several of the potential problems with each swing type having suffered some of those problems with my development. I enjoyed it for being different. A little repetitious out of the gate or I would have given it a 5 star."
5,the light is finally on!,mike finally explains why we all do not swing alike. body type and physical assets are the key. now us big guys don't have to swing like gary player. the explanations are right on. the drills are good too. thanks mike.
3,"Good Idea, But.....","I enjoyed reading this book, and it certainly had some good ideas, but I'm not sure it helped my golf swing at all.If I had been able to properly implement the instructions in the book, it might have helped more; but you can only learn so much of a golf swing motion from still pictures and written instructions.I recommend video or personal instruction where you can see the whole swing and/or get instant feedback.This book might be more useful to an instructor and not an amateur golfer."
2,Good idea...but...,"All three of the authors have great credentials and the idea is a good one. However, the neat of the book is like eating an overcooked thanksgiving turkey. It looks great but is very dry. I like the idea ofbody types and the authors give great examples of PGA pros who fit all 3 types so that we can fit ourselves into the types. I found the content to be too technical while trying to be reader friendly. It reads a lot like Nick Bradley's 7 Laws of the Golf Swing looks like in illustrations. It just has too much information to absorb. Better luck next time.For a good book try Bob Rotella's Golf is not a Game of Perfect and Pia Nihlson's Every Shot Must Have a Purpose. These two books are outstanding."
1,CAUTION-UNDER CONSTRUCTION,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FOR YOU TO SELL A BOOK OR TELL A STORY THERE IS NO NEED FOR SO MUCH NASTY SEX.
2,Not particularly noteworthy,"Typical book of the genre (Xena/Gabrielle inspired modern-day internet stories). Not particularly noteworthy or interesting. The plot and dialogue are predictable and redundant. The basic story could have been told in half the chapters. Many scenes seem to be added only to fill space and create a full length book.While better than the author's other works, it is a fair read (at best) if one is downloading it for free from the internet. Definitely not worth spending the money on a hard print version."
4,Very sexy,Very sexy ! Very entertaining story and characters. The sex scenes are very realistic and provocative. I really enjoyed reading this book and will definitely read more from this author.
2,Poor,Came in pieces with the fuse and top cap out and off. So far it has power to it after screwing it together. Will see how long it works. Same problem with the one I had before that stopped working.
1,It blows fuses!!,"This charger looked like a bargain because of the price, but in both of our cars it blows a fuse in the car if you plug or unplug it from the cigarette lighter socket while the car is running. The only way I can plug it in is when the car is turned off. No other cigarette-lighter plug I've ever used in these cars has such a problem."
5,Motorola HS850 car charger,Very helpful to have but haven't used it yet. I just labeled it since it is mixed up with other car charger items.
4,Everything fit not all hardware included.,Everything fit and works just fine. I had to buy and install nuts that were not included in the kit.
2,Not as good as I wanted.,"This item was not as good as I had hoped for. After installation, it lasted about two days. It was easy to install butWINDOW REGULATOR chevy chevrolet SILVERADO PICKUP 99-04 gmc YUKON DENALI 00-05 TAHOE cadillac ESCALADE 02-05 ESV 03-05 SIERRA 02-04 XL 01-05 AVALANCHE EXT front lhit just locked up and wouldn't roll up or down. It was from Parts Train. The dealer I purchased it from was very good in helping me. (Great Auto Parts)."
2,Shine Didn't Last,"I applied a healthy layer of this simple, self-buffing wax until my shoes had a solid gleam, and went to work feeling slick and professional. But when I got home, my shoes looked only slightly less battered than when I set off. I don't have the world's most strenuous job (I teach English), and if this stuff can't survive three hours of lectures on literature, how can someone doing real back-breaking work expect it to last? A proper shoe-shine kit, with brushes and rags and polish in a can, costs more money and requires more work, but at least you know your shoes will still shine at the end of the day."
4,"Finally, a blue ink!","None of the stores seem to have BLUE! Only black, which is similar to this brand. The sponge soaks in the ink, and I paint it on my shoes. Goes on quick and my shoes look like new. Love it!"
2,Outdated,"I am a ski instructor and bought this video with the hopes of adding to my bag of tricks for teaching. I found this video to be way out of date and based on European skiing styles of the 1990's. Even though the instructor was on shaped skis, he was still teaching the straight ski methods."
5,"Demons, Death, and Devilish Puns","In most of Harman's works, dozens of characters combine to create hilarious chaos. This is no exception. When one of the demons of hell whilst possessing a fly notices a priest trying out mind control, he must have it! His experiments with it instigate religious conversion by misprint, counterfitting, sheep-sttealing, and, oh yes, the beginning of the end of the world by global warming. A definate good read. Just beware the absolutely appaling puns in nearly every name. Ack!"
5,Sauces you can't do without,"I've used this for years and the bearnaise also and it is almost unfailable. Delicious and just exactly enough for at least three people. Four if you are more generous than I am. I love it, the two sauces are extremely difficult to make from scratch and these are so easy. Like making gravy but easier."
2,Not what I expected,"Although Margaret provides some good points to this painting, I was a bit disappointed with the camera angles. Also, the students acting a bit like immature high school kids, it took away from the presentation. After the actual fill in of the subject, which seems so huge to me, the camera stops and Margaret comes back with this beautiful painting that was more proportioned. What happened to the in between? How did she come to this step? Those steps were left out and I don't know how she was able to whittle it down to this lovely painting. I expected more steps and better explanation of the lesson."
4,An early entry in the Potter series,"An early entry in the Harry Potter movies, still quite good and very watchable. The characters really are children in this film"
4,A strong series continuation,"The second film in the Harry Potter series is another excellent book adaptation. The cast, design, direction--all combine to bring Hogwarts to life once more."
4,Corny but still quite funny,"Danny Kaye is at his best in this light-hearted farce of swashbuckling romance full of tongue-twisters and athletic tom-foolery. Even the villains seem to be enjoying their broad take-off of old-fashioned. A very pleasant respite from the loud, rude, crude comedy of today."
4,"Amazing Video Collection: Man Against Nature, Description","Reality television best describes the highlights of this video as the viewers can view footage of real disasters occurring and people's actions or reactions to the turmoil. These are firsthand accounts of floods, fires, tornadoes, and other natural disasters, all caught on tape and assembled on this video. The footage and highlights features no actors or reenactments of the disasters. Real people are fighting to survive, some displaying their courage to help others in distress, while others fight to stay alive. This 50-minute video is part of a series of other Amazing Video tapes that display the harshness of nature and the resilience of man in the elements."
1,Awful Awful Awful,"Awful. Not fully compatible with Windows XP. Once a day I need to COMPLETELY Uninstall/Reinstall (both hardware and software). This card is horrible. Support is almost nonexistent. D-Link cards, though a little pricier, are of MUCH MUCH higher quality. Stay away from this trash."
1,Stay away from this piece of junk,I bought this card because I thought I would save a few dollars compared to cards from more reputable brands. But this card is a piece of junk. I am experienced with wireless networks and have installed many such cards before. The software/drivers are nests of bugs. The range of the card is pathetic. Stay away from this.
4,Great Gift For An Expectant Mother,"This is one of Lynn Johnston's earlier works before she became famous for her cartoon strip ""For Better or Worse"".Unlike the strip ""For Better or Worse"" which is centred around the Patterson family and usually has a continuing story line this book contains one panel gags (101 in total) and has a variety of characters in it. Although for those who have followed her cartoons you may be able to find a young Elly & Michael Patterson in the book.The book has a lot of funny gags told from a variety of perspectives including from the first time parents, expectant mothers, fathers, siblings etc.It would make the ideal present for someone who is expecting or for someone who is a Lynn Johnston fan."
4,Excellent beginner's set,"We found this a wonderful beginner's set to the game. The board is of decent quality, so it's fairly easy to upgrade to a ""classier"" set later by picking up a pair ofbowls. Finally, enlist your kids' interest by combining this with a copy of the excellent Hikaru no Gomangaoranime:-)"
3,get what you pay for but still good,"This is by far the cheapest compared to other Go collections. Don't let the word ""stones"" fool you though. For what you really get more like...pebbles...made with a plastic with a cheapy feel to it. But after playing a game or two or just messing around trying to learn the rules with a friend, it's not even noticeable. Because of the insane amount of strategy that can be used in this game, the way things feel in your hand isn't anything you'd be thinking about anyways. Most likely won't even ""need"" anything more extravagant until maybe after playing 100+ games with this one."
3,too small,"the go is OK. but its shape is really small. if it could be larger it will be better. however, it is still worth its price"
4,Go game,"The game was exactly what I expected. It's a little hard to learn at first, but we are getting the hang of it. It would help to find someone that has played it before."
1,Not worth the money,"Confusing, confusing, confusing. Needing a book to explain a ""simple"" game should have been my first clue that buying this game was a mistake. We read, and then re-read the book and were too confused to even start playing this game. It is being donated to Goodwill"
4,Effective for beginners,"This is one of the few Go sets that reaches into 'reasonably priced' territory. One could easily spend a small fortune on a set. This one is very fairly priced, comes with a pretty solid wooden board and nice fascimile playing pieces. Anyone looking to get into Go would benefit from buying this inexpensive set.The one downside is the lack of adequate containment for the stones. They come in two small plastic bags. You're going to want some small bowls or sealable containers to hold them."
4,Good to start with...,"This a nice board set to start with and if you where to start a Go club it is probably one of the cheaper sets outside the travel sets for learning to play.My one major problem with this set is in general it is still kinda small for my tastes. Especially the stones. I find them hard to place on a crowded board even when using proper placing technique. I have fairly large hands which doesn't help the matter.Also the beads are plastic, but when it comes to Go boards, you sort of expect it at this price range.Other than that it is a nice set to start with if you are looking a cheaper more practical playing equipment."
4,"Great graphics, easy storyline & stupid puzzles...","If you are looking for a great mystery game this is not it. However if you are looking for a game with great graphics, a so/so mystery & vexing puzzles than you'll love it.Storyline: The puzzles can be difficult but generally are just boring/frustrating. The mystery plot starts out interesting but is WAY too easy. The game tells you where to go (ie I need to talk to so & so). The Prague storyline is far more engaging than the modern day Chicago one.Graphics: The graphics, dialogue, & voiceovers are amazing!Puzzles: The puzzles are just plain stupid, sometimes difficult, and unconnected to the game. The last part of the game is all puzzles which detracts from the momentum & intrigue of the storlyine.Misc. I found the nudity/sex angle of the game juvenile and totally unnecessary that only teenage boys would enjoy.The game definitely has some fun exciting moments but if you're looking for an interactive dynamic mystery game this is not it."
4,My thoughts on Still Life,"I love mysteries, so I loved Still Life. Especially the way it went back and forth between Victoria and her grandfather, Gus. I also enjoyed the graphics, and the game play itself was easy enough to do. Some of the puzzles were a challenge, but it would not be a good game if the puzzles were too easy. I would definitely recommend this game."
2,"Warning, ran ouf of money, ending just sketches and storyboards!!!","Just a warning that they ran out of money in producing this, so didn't really finish, just took sketches and storyboards and pasted them together for the ending. So, you'll get a vivid, engrossing story for about 2/3 of the way, and then a kind of narrative over what they had hoped to achieve if they had had resources to finish. So, beware of what Still Life II will encompass. Be sure and read reviews before investing in next game!!!"
1,Really disappointing.,"This game was extremely disappointing for me.The profanity is unnecessary and trite-a forced use of the F-bomb that fits neither the dialogue nor the atmosphere.The lack of an ending:this game ended so fast I think I have whiplash.I'm pretty sure it ended because I saw the credits roll.Only the ending from a S.King movie can abuse a person this bad.The game play is linear but the story line didn't make up for it.I think the only puzzle I enjoyed was the lockpicking. It starts easy,so you can understand it, and then became a bit harder in the end(so you can think). The rest were either stupidly easy or impossible(the cookies!!).I think if this game ended,I could recommend it, but I feel like I just got ripped off.I wouldn't bother unless you are a die-hard adventure fan and need a fix."
1,I think bored teenagers made this,"This is the first review I have written but this was so poorly written that I wanted to review it. The mentality of the script if that of a rebellious teen who just discovered foul language. The plot is incredibly boring and the exaggerated characters are annoying. I can't tell you how it ends because my disc froze up and will not continue. I purchased this on Amazon and received a used or pirated copy or the game which was not what I had ordered. I was to get a new game. Overall, Amazon has really blown it with this one."
1,What a piece of garbage!!,"Even at 6 bucks at Odd Lot was a rip off! Incredibly stupid and vulgar dialog with no point other than to be gross, cryptic clues so far from reality that only an online walkthrough could help, boring and stupid flow. I have rarely played a game as bad as this! Quarter of the way through I just had to uninstall it, glue the box back together and ship it back to those morons at the Adventure Company! Another company to ignore in the future. Beware, you will be disappointed!"
4,Great Story,"My dad gave me this game after he had played it. It's very challenging, and I loved the story line right from the start.The voice acting is a little strange at times, but overall it's a good script.The only thing that bothers me is a few of the challenges/activities within the game can't be solved by logic, or information found at the scene. The one I can think of in particularly is picking a lock. Other than that the game is fun and I would recommend it to other people."
4,Riveting Game!,"Victoria McPherson is not someone you'd want on your tail. She seems undaunted in her objective: to hunt down and put away one very sick, twisted serial killer. She's cute, witty and not afraid to confront her tyrannical boss both in attitude and a good dose of profanity.....not sure what it was about her that reminded me of my youngest sister......Well, we need someone like her, because this killer is a sicko of mammoth proportions. The storyline was addicting as it kept me playing the game just to see what would happen next. Great game to play in the dark, if you want to be creeped out.Enjoyed the graphics (esp. the scene outside of Pat's house), cut scenes, puzzles, musical score and, of course, Victoria.The only suggestion would be to cut down on the cursing or replace them with something less offensive.I look forward with great anticipation the sequel to this game...if you play it, wait for the scenes at the end of the credits!"
3,woke up my imagination,I really enjoyed the character and different locations. Difficulty was a four star.
4,"Fantastic adventure game, too bad about the ending...","I really, really enjoyed this game. If you like adventure games and detective games, you should enjoy the gameplay here. This was one of the best 2D point-and-click adventure games I'd played in a long time, and I would have given it 5 stars except for one thing: The Ending.The ending of this game is abrupt and does not resolve the plot. It's very frustrating, especially as I was so involved in the mystery and the characters. Apparently, there was meant to be a sequel, but the company went under.So, if you love adventure games and want to play a nice one, play this, but be warned."
3,Not much character,"Its fun, its bloody, and sometimes thrilling. Is it bloody thrilling? Well, no. Still Life is a great game to play while waiting for something more epic to be produced. I liked the challenge of the past and present storylines that intertwined throughout this adventure. What Still Life lacks is engaging characters and a decent ending. I get the feeling this was a game with an intended sequel that was never made...The player is left completely hanging and with no closure. Not exactly a nice reward for spending hours of time devoted to problem solving and some annoying pixel-hunting. If you are bored, in need of adventure, try the Longest Journey, or Syberia first-you'll find much more depth and satisfaction from either of these choices."
3,A little bit too still...,"Still Life is a cool adventure game with great atmosphere and exciting story.Unfortunately, it also drags quite a bit since e.g. you cannot jump to certain points, you always have to walk to your car or take the elevator and have to endure the scenes over and over again without being able to skip it.Also, the background is too still for my taste, nothing really moves and there's not much to look at despite of things you need to do or handle.The riddles are probably a question of personal taste too...I don't like 'combine wire a to wire z to make something work' too much.The story is thrilling and you play two characters...Victoria and her grand dad who chased after the same murderer.So, all in all, it's a good game but cannot compete with the classics like the Black Mirror trilogy."
4,Still Life is entertaining ... and fun,I finished this game with the help of a walk thru because several puzzles I could not see how to solve. I have played adventure games since Myst and 7th Guest and really enjoy a good one.This game is a good one and provides hours of fun.
3,Voice as an Instrument !,"The most important instrument of all is our voice, and Bruce got it! He is the personification of how the voice can be managed to almost anything you want. You may ask why I rate this album only 3 star? I do it because it not brings anything new, in spite of the opening song broken! I hope the next incoming albums bring something new...Long live Bruce and is voice!Pereira"
4,See the ball,Due to some eye surgery I was having trouble seeing the tennis ball especially in the sun. These glasses were recommended to me by several tennis playing friends. They certainly have helped me concentrate on the fast moving green orb coming at me. It also helps in preventing squint wrinkles around the eyes. Definitely for the tennis court only.
5,An Essential Crib Toy,"This crib toy is a MUST for every new baby. I purchased one for my 2 1/2 month old daughter and she is mesmerized by it. The soother has a good volume control, which allows me to decide how loud the baby needs the music. The lights are soft and move along to the music. It also has 3 different settings with 1 lullaby, 10 lullabies or 3 different nature sounds. A good thing about it is that once the music has started you don't have to wait until it is over, but simply press the button on the toy or on the remote to turn it off. I am about to purchase another one to give as a gift."
4,Don't get me wrong...,"it's a good toy. I just got our's in the mail, so it may even be a great toy. As I was with a few things I received from Amazon this Christmas, I was disappointed in the size of this toy- it's smaller than you think. The remote that everyone raved about only turns the toy on or off- it doesn't change the volume or the settings for which music you want. The soothing nature sounds (which i love) don't accompany the lights, only the lullaby does. Still, my 9 month old immediately figured out how to press the button to turn it on and she does seem fascinated with the lights and the pictures of animals on it, so all in all it's a good idea. Just don't get your hopes up from reading all the other customer reviews and think you got the be all and end all toy- I don't think it's going to save anyone's day. It might make your baby smile a little though!"
5,A must have!,"This is absolutely the BEST crib toy. I consider it to be a 'must have' for all babies up to age 2 (and for parents who like sleep!). We used to use the nature sounds mode to put our newborn to sleep and as he got older switched to the lights and music for interactive mode. Once he learned to turn it on by pushing the button at a very young age, we got so much more sleep! We would get up at 7am to get ready for work and hear his music playing. He would play it over and over until we went in to get. On weekends, we'd let him stay in there until 10am sometimes because he was so happy playing the music and watching the lights over and over. Now that he is out of a crib, he carries it around and bangs it against stuff... very sturdy."
5,Wow! Thanks to Fisher Price. This is the BEST,"I first saw the Slumbertime Soother on Amazon.Com, and bought it immediately for my 2 month old. He loved listening to the nature sounds to go to sleep. Now at 7 months, he doesn't miss anything. He can see and listen VERY WELL. And we think that it has something to do with the visual and audio stimulation provided by this WONDERFUL TOY. Not to mention that it has been dropped down our stairs, twice and earned not so much as a scuff on it. Its very sturdy."
5,great,"I was very skeptical about this toy. As my daughter is a good sleeper, we didn't even try it until she was about 6 mos. old. However, now she is 9 months and it never fails to put her to sleep, even when nappy time is interupted or she is having a bad night. You would think the lights would keep her awake, but it gives her something to look at while the music or sounds work their majic. this will be my first choice for my next baby shower gift!"
1,Toy with no purpose,"It was a gift. It sounded great. I wish I kept the box so I could return it. It gives different music arrangements. and the remote is a catchy idea but what for? If they'refalling asleep the music needs to be very low to be soothing, if they play wiit a bit louder. So, you have to go in the room anyway. My 9 mo. old bangs his hands on it tuning rock-a-bye-baby on and off 50 times, so annoying. It's durability is it's best feature. Want music in your childs room? Put a CD on continuous play. Want the educational purposes, give him a busy box. Save your $$$$"
4,All in all a good toy...,We received this toy when my daughter was about 5 weeks old. She was scared of it at first. Her lower lip would quiver and she wanted nothing to do with it. It took her about a week to decide that she liked it. I decided to hang it on her changing table instead of her crib because I needed something to keep her occupied as I changed her. She is now almost 3 months old and loves this toy. She even has gotten the hang of hitting the botton by herself to start the music. I also love this toy because it keeps her occupied long enough while she is getting changed that changing her diaper or clothes is no longer a stuggle.
2,Think ahead...,"One thing you might want to keep in mind... How sensitive are your child's senses? My son loved this toy when we first showed it to him at 3 months of age. He liked the music and lights, for about 10 minutes. After that, he was completely bored. Then, one night as he rolled around, he hit the button that starts it, and we couldn't get him to stop crying for about 5 minutes. When the music plays, the lights also go. His cozy, peaceful crib was transformed into a noisy place with lights flashing at him. Yikes! Also, at 6 months old, he broke it. Didn't seem that durable to me..."
4,Great product!,"This is a wonderful toy for nighttime! My son can turn it on himself, but the part I love is that I can turn it on without going into his room by using the remote control. There are 3 different settings--short play (plays just one lullaby at a time), long play (cycles through the lullabys), and nature sounds which I haven't timed, but plays for about 10-15 minutes I would say. The flashing lights dance with the music offering a great opportunity for kids to learn as they try and anticipate which shape will light up next."
1,Try another...,"No problem with seller but product has a design flaw. The only way it stays attached to a door or wall is by two rubber caps which hold the support posts to the brackets. This just does not work. Had to drill & put two screws in the support posts to hold it securely. Also, this product is also only made for woman's/small shoes. Would not fit mens and bends easily when loaded. Would not buy again."
3,First step to shoe clean-up,"I have a shoe ""problem:"" too many shoes and not enough floor space. That said, it was time to find an off-the-floor solution that was also aesthetically pleasing. This hit the spot. The downside is the end caps on the over-the-door hooks that slip off when the racks are too heavy (aka filled with shoes). I have to be gentle and not bump it, lest the whole thing fall down. Otherwise, this is the cheapest and best solution."
3,OK for women's just so-so for men's,"I have 11 size shoes and only every other row (3) with two pairs per row - just six pair fit correctly. While you can ""stuff"" a few more I would guess not smart to do with """"good"" shoes. For the price they could have had fewer rows and better spacing between shoes for a 5 star product. Four rows with three pairs would give 112 pairs and cost them less to make!"
1,don't buy,I put it up and all the racks did not stay in.. if the shoes are to heavy the rack will fall. made very cheap . if i close m door to hard all the rack will fall off
1,over door shoe rack,"THIS ITEM NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. WHEN YOU PUT YOUR SHOES ON THE RACK THE ENTIRE ROW THAT HOLDS THE SHOES FALLS OFF. THIS ITEM NEEDS TO BE MADE ""ALL IN ONE"" AND NOT JUST HOOK EACH ROW ON. IF THE ENTIRE UNIT WAS ALL IN ONE THEN IT WOULD BE A GREAT ITEM, JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. AS IS, IT IS NOT WORTH ANYTHING. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE I CAN GET AN ""ALL IN ONE OVER THE DOOR SHOE RACK WITH THE INDIVIDUAL SHOE HOLDERS"", NOT BARS THAT YOUR SHOES FALL OFF OF. NANCY"
4,This album just freaking rocks!,"Album One from Core Factor has a quality not found in most modern rock - ORIGINALITY. Whether they're serving up smoothly grinding melodies like Asphalt Jungle, haunting tunes like Locked, emo-laden songs like Look Away, or flat-out-rock-the-house jams like Breathing Motive, this band delights with its unique sound. They do it all on one album - (shades of Smashing Pumpkins or Faith No More) - and they do it well. If you want to listen to music that is fresh and highly addictive, buy Album One. You will certainly be the envy of your friends if you own this album.My personal favorite is Prism, but this is really the type of CD that you can listen to from start to finish, unlike the crap you usually find with only one or two good songs. Also, the cover of Paula Abdul's Straight Up will amaze you - it rocks!"
5,Diversity and Melody,"I was surprised by the quality of this album. The wide range of musical styles kept me guessing, but almost every song stuck in my head and kept me humming. Although I can't decide which song was my favorite (although I'm leaning toward either Locked or Bones), I definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes rock."
1,very hard to get into cd,this cd does not rock. highly lacking enrgy. ok if you like rock hip hop but all around not very prodused cd.
2,Interesting but...,"Interesting enough but a definite British focus. And a caveat: the entry on ""safety pin"" includes a gigantic, eye-popping photo of Elizabeth Hurley in her infamous Versace safety pin dress. While it definitely shows a creative use for safety pins, the picture isn't particularly appropriate to include in this kind of book. So if you're thinking about buying for a kid, reconsider."
3,Seemingly ok in the factual sense but...,"Harrison is wrong to a degree when he talks about man being a pathological killer in the gun section of the book. The Gatling gun was invented by a man who was trying to end warfare (he was hoping the gun would be so scarily lethal that no one would want to go to war) yet no mention of Gatling's noble motive was made by Harrison. Also, how many people only carried, or even invented new forms of, guns to defend themselves against bears or wolves or hyenas etc. You know back in the 1800's many people (even those who lived in towns) had to put with occasional bear attacks and unwelcomed ursine visits and there were no tranquilizer guns in those days (unlike today) so to get a bear rendered harmless you had usually to shoot with bullets. Harrison your generalization on gunmakers was mean or clueless. But wrong either way."
5,Summer Breeze,This book was the ultimate story of true love. Very few books bring tears of joy to my eyes and this one surely did. Well done.
4,Special story!,"A love story about a girl with severe PTSD. The hero helps her find her way, but ultimately the heroine is the one to change her own life."
5,Summer Breeze,"it was one of the best books I think she has written a real who-dun-it and yet was funny and passionate. It is better when you read the first book Keegans Lady as that is possibly her best book,yet I never liked ""historical"" romances and I even wrote to Cahterine and told her so but after reading these two I changed my mind and now can hardly wait till Early Dawn is out. Also Amazon is amazing as the order got to me in short order, considering I am out on a farm in Iowa and the selection was unbleiveable as I now have almost all of Cahterine's books. You will not be diasappointed in either amazon or any of Chatherine's books both are truly amazing!!!"
4,LOVED IT!!!,"I haven't read a book in 2 years due to having a young one at home - I have no time. I went away for a few days a brought this book with me (I bought it last summer and hadn't cracked it yet). Once I opened it, I couldn't put it down. It drew me in- made me laugh, cry, and love each character. I would tell anyone to read it and let them introduce themselves to Joseph and Rachel...their love was so beautiful as well as the story."
2,"Great camera, if it works!!","This camera is small, nice looking, has good pictures, and cheap ($399 including freight). I was very happy. However, like some of the other users, it broke down after about 30 minutes of use. It keeps prompting for heading cleaning and I know the head is dirty because blocks of noise appear during playback. It happens especially bad during LP mode. Why???Needless to say, I am disappointed. I have also thrown away some of the package (manual in French, registration card, etc.) If the seller won't give me full credit because of this, I can only have JVC repair it. But according to my past experience, once they open up a camcorder, only more troubles to follow."
2,Beware of JVC camcorders!!!,"My 300u has the same problem with the clean head message too. After approx. 30 min of recording and playing, ""clean head warning"" appears and blocks of noise appear during playback. This happened just last Sunday with a brand new unit. But came Monday everything seems to be normal again. Strange!! I am using TDK tapes (not Sony some users complain of messing up the video head), but according to their link, you may be damaging your camcorder by using anything other than JVC tape!!"
2,A little expensive with this model,"This digital camcorder brings Mini DV performance with a 680k pixel CCD and PCM Digital Audio for excellent picture & sound. Full DV connectivity, convenient LCD screen, plus a serial transfer cable and high value PC software package.But I think it should be cheaper."
1,Problems with 2 units.,"The reviews for this product are excellent and I was so excited to upgrade to HDMI switching. The first unit received had a loud hum in the audio and HDMI from my new Sony player through this unit created an extreme blue cast on the video. I returned the unit and another was sent to me. This unit had no hum in the audio but the blue cast was still there when using HDMI from the Sony DVD player. It was not the DVD player because when I hooked the HDMI from the DVD player directly to my TV everything was perfect. I am very disappointed in this unit. As for Amazon, they have been great in responding to my problems, getting a replacement unit to me and then refunding my purchase. I give Amazon 5 stars."
5,Onkyo 804 Receiver,"Great unit-set up with Bose AM 7's; Sony NS-75H DVD; Charter Box by Scientific Atlantic 3250; and Harmony Model 8800 remote. The set up was easy and the results were GREAT. Love the Onkyo TX-SR804, and AMAZON WAS TOP NOTCH- GREAT PRICE/NO SHIPPING OR TAX, and QUICK delivery.LIFE IS GOOD. HOORAY FOR HDMI too."
5,Awesome,Great reciever with lots of options. Sounds great. Don't think twice about making this purchase.
2,"A good receiver, but has video problems","I like this amp but it causes my TV (Sharp Aquos 42"" LCD) to lose synch whenever the video has a sudden white flashes (NFL sports transitions, War of the Worlds death-beam blasts, Drawn Together transitions, explosions, stuff like that). The synch loss takes about 5 or so seconds for my particular TV to recover from, which is pretty annoying. When I had the problem I searched the web and found that numerous others had similar problems with this and other Onkyo receiver models, but Onkyo doesn't seem to acknowledge the issue. It's a good receiver, but if you buy it save the packing for a few weeks just in case it causes problems for your TV as well. Given that these problems seem to have been around for a good year or more and Onkyo isn't fixing them, I can only give this 2 stars."
3,Merely a reference book for OWT starter,"Less practical example and heavy marketing attitude , if compare to other reference on oracle performance titile, other than tuning 101 (it's dummy)."
4,A great Radio Disney CD,"This Cd is great and has a lot of good songs on it. Some of my favorites on here are ""Halfway Around the World"", ""Bounce"", ""Perfect Day"", ""No More"", ""Blue"", ""It Happens Every Time"", and a lot of others. I like the parody of ""Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baha Men and Myra's ""Miracles Happen"" which is from the Disney movie The Princess Diaries. It's a real good CD for kids to listen to!"
5,The CD with the most magic in it!,"This CD gives you such a great, tingley, and magical feeling, than any other, when you listen to it! Out of all of the other disney and any other kind of CD (which is probably about 24) this is the best one!"
3,Not what I thought I was buying!!,"I bought this butane lighter expecting the ""blue flame"" lighter with the force to withstand wind. What I got was a typical ""clicker"" lighter that you can buy in the stores. You know, the red and black kind that are disposable. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice lighter but, it isn't what I anticipated a butane lighter to be. I guess I didn't read the description close enough. This lighters one advantage is that it can be refilled. Other than this, go to the store and buy the ones that are cheaper and disposable."
5,"Cute, nice construction","I like that you can see through the bag, and it's nicer than the clear plastic bags you normally would find. I use it to keep medications organized and easy to locate within a large tote. It is attractive, and is of a nice, solid construction. Worth the price (~$8)."
1,Dreck...Pure mallcore dreck...,"I have a problem here: On one hand I have a group of self-proclaimed ""musicians"" claiming to be hardcore, but in fact, they are mallcore. Now, I have nothing wrong with mallcore, as I like a great deal of it. But this ""CD"" is not worth the CD it's printed on. I mean ""rapcore""? Please. That stuff went the way of rappers having talent: Gone. I mean, how can ANYONE like a band that assumes that they are better than another(More talented) band, just because they have a bad CD out. That's just sad. This CD is typical ""Yo Yo"" rapcore that is unoriginal. REALLY unoriginal. This is just a bad CD they hope to sell to you using the tag-line ""But it's Christian music with a good messege."" That's no excuse."
4,Suburban Hypo-activity....,"I have been familiar with Hypo 12% for almost a year now. They really are a great group of guys who are humble and honest with their approach to their music.With that said, I'd like to encourage you all to support them by buying this album. Their music is an interesting blend of hip-hop laced harmony core. This is their debut full length release and we can expect some great things from this group from Mansfield.For fans of 311, Spoken, Travail, and just good quality independent music."
4,A Must For Alison Krauss Fans,"While Alison Krauss is best know for her work in the Blugrass genre This DVD allows Alison to showcsae her streaching out a bit into a more Americana style of music that she can do with ease backed by the members of her band Union Station.Dan Tyminsky(A Man Of Constant Sorrow)Ron Block and Dobro prodigy Jerry Douglas.Among the guests include James Taylor,Prad Paisly and bluegrass giants Tony Rice and Sam Bush.I only gave the DVD four stars due to the short duration of the DVD that really leaves you wanting for more."
5,Who doesn't love Alison Krauss!!,"The only thing wrong with Alison Krauss is that she is not prolific enough with her artistry. Her amazing voice is her art, of course. She should make more CDs, and more DVDs of her concerts.There are so many styles and voices out there, but there is only one Alison Krauss! Her haunting melodies stay with you into the night. You never forget them. Her guests were wonderful on this DVD. Especially James Taylor!"
4,What a voice!!! What talent surrounds!!!,"this woman's voice is the manifestation of bliss in sonic form...and it is so stunning to see and hear the effortlessness with which she sings...i don't know bluegrass history and legendary players as well as i might, but i am led to believe that sam bush and tony rice are masters...and they certainly prove it here...this sound is remarkable, i was skeptical because i rarely buy dvds that do not have surround sound, but i took a chance with this and was pleased...although it is not especially long, the interviews are nice in that they talk from the heart about alison and her talent, and the dvd as a whole simply and beautifully showcases the abilities of the musical geniuses around her...purchase and enjoy...and beware...because if you are in the least bit sentimental, as i am...you will want the kleenex close at hand for the title track..."
3,"Emmy winner, but not Krauss' best",This Emmy winning joint effort by Alison Krauss and Robert Plant contains some lovely songs and an krauss' haunting voice. Plant sounds completely different here. The two voices harmonize well. Still not her best. Rate it a 3 out of 5.
5,Snoopy Vs. the Red Barron,My boys ages 7 & 10 love this game and have played it nonstop since getting it.
3,The game is hard to follow.,The PS2 version has things happening too fast and all at once. The scope is more limited than on the PC version. I think I'll get use to it. (This game is easier to play if you have more than two thumbs - lol).
5,"Great Game, Great Price","The Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron game is a great game, I have always loved snoopy anyway I would reccommend this to anyone."
5,Awesome!,this was a gift for my older brother who is shall I say over 30... When he opened it we sat down together as a family and played. It was so much fun! The graphics are great and the entertainment value was unbelievable!! We ended up playing for hours!
4,More fun than expected,"We saw this game and thought it looked like fun, but we didn't realize how much fun it would be! The whole family really enjoys it. The music is a bit annoying so we keep the sound off or low. Overall a great purchase."
5,The best musical examination of 20s jazz,"Jazz criticism tends to run in two groups: one, the biographical/anecdotal (often marvelous to read), and two, word pictures of how the music made the writer feel (often awful to read). Gunther Schuller's ""Early Jazz"" does what any undergraduate musicology major would do: examine the music note by note, and explain what's going on. While this is not an easy book to read for people like me who have no musical training (or talent, for that matter), it is an absolutely essential book nonetheless. Schuller goes through each major musician and movement of the twenties, and shows exactly what is occurring. What worked best for me was to have the recording he was discussing playing while I read, so I could hear what he was talking about. Anybody in love with the early music of Armstrong or Ellington needs to tackle this book sooner or later."
4,understanding jazz,"the author gunther does a magnifent job of affording a history of the evolution of jazz, this in a most scholarly fashion. thus making at times somewhat academic effecting a use of words whose understanding may be elusive to the ordinary reader."
4,Canine Genetics,"A useful source of information on hereditary diseases of dogs, obviously slanted towards the USA scene. Just waiting for a UK author to produce a similar volume with less sweeping allegations of widespread canine defects amongst pedigree dogs."
3,Another Sci-Fi series novel,"The first half of the book has great character development and plot build-up. That an evil corporation was doing something evil with nanotechnology. A rather new concept in the early 90s. Anyway, the story was unfolding rather well until the second half of the book. It was hard for me to transition from Sci-Fi to Fantasy-Fi. I couldn't really stay in touch with the book, it seemed like a roller-coaster ride, some concepts were just too ""out there"", as if the writer was on drugs. The story does have a twist at the end, but you'll have to read this book. I give this book 3 stars."
4,Fun to share with the kids,The funny thng about watching these videos after (ahem) 20+ years is forgetting the original videos that Al satirizes. Found myself looking for the videos on IYouTube with the kids. Good for some laughs all around.
4,Terrific collection,"I recommend this DVD: if you like Weird Al, you will enjoy it. However, here is a warning:If you enjoyed watching and listening to Weird Al's great spoofs and originals, haven't seen them for years and years, and have heard that they are now available on one DVD and you think you would love to see all those funny videos again:You may find that they were funnier in your imagination. [Sounds like Paul Simon's Kodachrome, doesn't it!] You may find that you have forgotten the videos the parodies are based on. You used to enjoy all the jokes on Madonna and Michael Jackson, but now you can't remember their video clips and there is something missing.This was my first reaction. But I am over it and am now enjoying them as much as I ever did.So, be warned, but if you enjoyed them before, you will enjoy them again.Dare to be stupid!"
4,"Great Stuff, but poor interoperability (iPhone)","As always, I love Weird Al's videos, but it this disc won't go onto my iPhone in anything other than a huge contiguous block. I guess that's for anti-piracy purposes, but I'm not a pirate and wanted to watch these on my iPhone. In this day and age, watching on different formats should be facilitated."
2,Sometimes more really is less,"I had previously enjoyed The Compleat Al and wanted my own copy, when I noticed that The Ultimate Video Collection included virtually all of those old greats with several newer items.Alas! The newer items do not reflect the same high craftsmanship and attention to detail that characterized classics like ""Dare To Be Stupid"", ""Eat It"", and ""Like a Surgeon"".Worse yet, the newer songs include offensive elements and reach new lows for crudity. Never mind that I don't want my children to see these; I don't want to see them, either. They aren't funny.Now I wish I had just bought The Compleat Al. I would have all the good stuff, plus a goofy mockumentary of Al's life, and the whole family could enjoy it together without mute or fast forward."
1,"Can't really rate the ACTUAL disc, since I didn't get it!","I hate to give this one star, because the truth is that we didn't get the disc for this! We ordered it and the disc inside doesn't have the music video's on it, instead it has a Weird Al concert, which is nice, but it's not what I ordered at all. I got this for my husband for Father's Day and he likes it okay but was disappointed by the lack of music videos he expected. I don't even really know how to get this corrected and I'm very wary of trying to order another copy due to the other reviewer having the same issue multiple times. I would even be willing to pay for it again and keep this one, since it's kind of growing on my husband. But I can't do that without knowing I'm going to get the right disc!It's very misleading as I got this NEW and the package was never opened. It is the right package, wrong DVD."
5,Great videos,For the true Weird Al fan...Most of the best videos he's made in one place. It doesn't have the newest ones but it's close enough for most folks.
1,Beware of Misprints,"Sorry Al, but your production company screwed up. The box and insert and disc labels all say ""Ultimate Video Collection"", but twice now what I got was actually the concert video ""Weird Al Live"". Disappointed because I really wanted to get this collection. Posting this a warning to other Weird Al fans."
2,"REAGAN BASHING, unfortunately","The RIDICULOUS REAGAN BASHING in the x-mas video SOURS the whole experience. Partly because one doesn't expect something that IGNORANT from an otherwise APPARENTLY bright person like Yankovic. As anyone who's the LEAST BIT interested in truth knows, Reagan passionately LOATHED nukes!--read the diaries, EVERY [even LEFTIST] biography, ET AL! Even if Yankovic was truly stupid enough to believe that in the 80's-as an artist, if I had published anything 'slanderous' [!you don't get more SERIOUSLY slanderous than imputing LOVE of war/nukes, much less to a person who passionately LOATHES them!] and it ''turned out'' to be EMPIRICALLY, BLATANTLY OFF-BASE I would re-edit/cut entirely! We must demand the same HONORABLE BEHAVIOUR from Yankovic. To not so do, BESMIRCHES THE ENTIRITY OF YANKOVIC'S CREATIONS! Inl'g this dvd."
5,The best of Al,"I've been a Weird Al fan since I was a kid listening to, and eating up, ""Eat it,"" ""Fat,"" ""Living with a hernia,"" and all the rest. I would go to MTV and jump up and down when AL TV came on. Ok, maybe I'm too ""White and nerdy,"" but I and my kids love this DVD. It brings together the entire scope of Al's career, from the Dr. Demento days to the high tech ""All about the pentiums."" Lots of good clean fun."
1,wrong item on disc.,"I ordered ""Weird Al Yankovic- the ultimate video collection"". While the dvd packaging and disc itself read what I ordered,the disc itself is a live concert. Beware when ordering this as you might also get the wrong item."
4,No Weird Al Fan Should Be Without This!,"I wouldn't consider myself a Weird Al fan - I've always hummed along and enjoyed his parodies, but haven't gone out my way to buy them.This DVD pulls all of his more popular videos together and make for a great time of watching! There are songs on here I had completely forgotten about, but couldn't help laughing as I remembered every word and sang along!"
4,Great little book!,"I bought this book to celebrate and track the arrival of our chihuahua puppy. It is a cute little book with spaces for photos and sentimental things. The fill-in-the-blank format makes it a joy to fill out. I am giving 4 stars because I think that the book should be a little bigger for the price. All in all, a nice keepsake!"
4,Cute,"This baby book for puppies is pretty cute. There are a lot of nice pages of subjects I wouldn't even think to keep a record of. I was hoping for a little more, even the book tells you to glue an envelope to the cover for documents. Why not just have the book come with this? There also aren't very many pages, but I suppose it is just for baby puppies and doesn't cover some of the topics that could be considered for slightly more grown up puppies. All in all, I like it and it is adorable. I guess I'll just have to hunt for something more detailed for when he's not a baby anymore."
2,Not worth buying,"I use to own this, read it, wasn't impressed. If for some reason you want to make one of these a player character then maybe this is worth buying, otherwise it is not. If you can pick this up somewhere on clearance for $1 it is worth buying, otherwise skip it. The Slayer's Guide Series over all is very good though. I would recommend Yuan-ti as the best of the lot."
2,disappointing,"Unlike Matthi Forrer's previous effort, entitled ""Hokusai"" (now sadly out of print), and which by far exceeded the current volume both in size (litterally, having been close to A3 format) as well as depth and scope, this issue is hampered by a diminished quality of graphical reproduction (small-sized images, mostly black & white), as well as an almost complete omission of Hokusai's accomplished late works - which are mostly colour paintings on silk (kakemono), rather than the more familiar ukyo-e prints.Overall a regrettable step back."
2,pretty good game,"This is a preety good game but after a while, it is very boring. i enjoyed it for about 2 months but now i am not intrested in it."
5,Start early on a weekend morning....,"....and make sure there are no afternoon football, basketball or baseball games you want to watch either, because you won't go to sleep until you finish.I made the mistake of starting on a Friday evening, read until two AM, woke up at five thirty and finished it off by breakfast.If you like this genre of books, you will like everything about this book. The plot is familiar enough territory but the details are not -- by a long shot. You find yourself caring about the characters and their fate. The moment you think you have figured the plot out, a new twist appears. And no red herrings! (Well, maybe half of one). You'll hate the villans, love the good guys. You will become totally involved.My only problem with Davis is that he's spending too much time flying airplanes, and not enough writing suspense novels. He's two for two in the novel department."
4,why not call the Times?,"like may others who have reviewed this book, i enjoyed it, and read it in one day. A lot happens, the pages turn, one wonders what it going on. My one reservation is that, as the bodies pile up, the book wants us to feel that Our Hero is cornered, set up, framed - but instead the thinking reader starts to wonder: surely with all of this happening, someone besides Our Hero will notice that something is suspicious? That said, i recommend the book anyway."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A short collection of stories from Wyndham's times writing for Wonder Stories and/or its incarnations. As such, pretty average quality, in general.Wanderers of Time : Wanderers of Time - John WyndhamWanderers of Time : Derelict of Space - John WyndhamWanderers of Time : Child of Power - John WyndhamWanderers of Time : The Last Lunarians - John WyndhamWanderers of Time : The Puff-Ball Menace - John WyndhamAnt machine heat ray escape.3 out of 5Salvage wipeout.3 out of 5Sixth sense boy.3 out of 5Besieged by the Moon-Men.3 out of 5New vegetable spread.3.5 out of 52.5 out of 5"
3,Folds hard to get out,"The color of this is brighter than the picture shows, my only other issue is the rug comes folded and getting the fold marks out of the rug has been very hard. We have left it in the sun for quite a few days with no luck getting it out. Hopefully soon it will..."
1,Fox Run Juicer and Cup,The picture shown is a misrepresentation of the actual product. I would have returned if the price paid had been more.
1,Crimi8nally misleading..,This is a terribly misleading offer. Nothing that is shipped resembles what is offered. The idea that the item that shipped ever had a sugested retail price anywhere near $100.00 is ludicrous. It wasen't even worth the price charged. I have to assume that this is a mistake because if it was intentional it is criminal and probably legally actionable. Shame on you Amazon. I'm stck with it because it isn't even worth the freight to send it back. What an awful experience. Amazon should make an effort to make this right.
5,Great Sax!!!,"I haven't played the sax in a loooong while so i think i can be considered a beginner......ha. well, this sax is great for a beginner. i purchased this to brush back up and because i loved the idea of a purple sax! the color is deep, rich, shiny and overall very impressive. it came fully loaded with everything you will need to get started- except a tutor...lol. Great for lovers of purple and awesome as a gift."
5,Nice & heavy duty,This unit was purchased for a public library. Its has held up well and has not rusted after three years in snowy climate.
1,Not What It Claims To Be...,"I was apprehensive in ordering this item after reading a review from a previous customer. The reviewer stated it was not a patchouli plant, but at the nominal price, I decided to check it out for myself. I have to agree with the previous review--THIS IS NOT A PATCHOULI PLANT! Granted, I am not a botanical expert, or even well-versed in botanical plant names, however the seller's representation that this plant's essential oils are used for perfumes and incense, would lead me to believe that this is the plant I'm seeking. Let me assure you this is NOT an arromatic patchouli plant...I guess I'll just keep searching...and ""good luck"" to anyone else on the same quest. Should anyone find this elusive specimen, I would greatly appreciate knowing your successful source."
2,"MY OPINION ABOUT ""PROFILE OF A SERIAL KILLER""","I live in BRAZIL and confess that I bought this movie because of HUGH JACKMAN...however the movie surprised me...I liked very much of the tram, and Rebecca Gibney is an excellent actress too ! I recommend for everyone who like to see Hugh Jackman acting...He's very handsome in this production !!!"
3,DVD - Profile of a Serial Killer,"Haven't viewed it as yet. But for a Hugh Jackman fan, I'm sure it will go over big - my wife likes it already!"
2,Outdated! This is important......,"This WAS an excellent reference at one time. Folks, food information needs to be kept up to date. Basically, any food almanac needs to be updated every 2 years at least! Brands change, food are improved, ingredients are added or removed. Foods get better and foods get worse.This book was comprehensive. Not now. Many of the brands in the book have changed. Some have MUCH less fat, fewer calories, etc.If they would release a new edition, I would consider it. This is going to be returned to Amazon. There are plenty of others.My best advice, go to your local book store, peruse and review a few, then buy a CURRENT selection you like best from Amazon since you will likely save money!"
2,Don't Be Fooled By Its' Size,"At first glance this book seems to be a comprehensive guide to food values both generically and by brand, but the information it contains could have been printed in a book a third its' size. It is unnecessarilly redundant.For example, if you are looking up sliced cheese from the deli, it lists many brands, but they all have essentially the same values. The book also frequently omits the ""lite"" version of such items.Save your money and buy a pocket book. This book is not much better than one."
1,Outdated,Way outdated. Was good when first published. USDA changes data regularly. Better you visit the [...] site and pull down what you need there.
4,Excellent reference,"Like many of the other reviewers I bought this book a number of years ago, twenty to be exact. I have found it to be a excellent reference over the years. I plan to buy an updated version and would like to see the listings a bit clearer and have more food value information such as sugars, saturated fat vs total fat. None the less I have this book to be an excellent reference."
1,I know each person is different...,"so, please do not take this personally.This book did not work for me. Yes, it had the info I needed, but I've decided to go with a different diet that I feel this book does not have. I'm following Kevin Trudeau's Level 1 protocol, and it seems to be really working for me.With low-fat, I missed my cheese. With low-carb, I missed my sweets. With Kevin Trudeau's Level 1, I get to keep my cheese and sweets. I just can't have as many sweets as I'd like, but I do still get to keep them. And, I'm finding I'm craving sweets less with Kevin trudeau's Level 1 (from Weight Loss Cures ""They"" don't want you to know about).Hope this helps in your own personal decision."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!,"I bought this product because I was looking for a Mini USB Car Charger. I thought that's what I would be getting when I bought this product because it's titled as so... But, no, it's a regular USB car charger. The worst part about it is this companies return policy. I have to pay to ship it back which will most likely end up costing me what it was to buy the product in the first place. I am considering it money down the drain and would not recommend buying this product to anyone. I'm incredibly disappointed and will avoid purchasing from this company in the future."
1,Awful,"This charger is awful! I'd give it zero stars if Amazon would let me.I got this charger ""free"" from Sprint when I got my HTC Hero phone. It's sat on my desk at home for the last 12 months. In the past 3 months, I've started using it in my vehicle and the plastic coating on the cord is cracking all the way down exposing the wires. I've taped it up with electrical tape several times only to noticed a new section beginning to come apart the next day. I've stopped using it as of 3 days ago. Sprint now tells me that they don't even sell/make this charger any more because all cell phones now have interchangable chargers. So now I'm stuck buying a new charger. Whatever one I do end up buying, it will not be made by Motorola."
4,Great inexpensive mini USB charger,"Very inexpensive, works fine, only thing is I wish the cord were a little longer. But it serves the basic function at a very cheap price!"
4,Cord a little short/tight.,"Overall I like the cord. Well built, and I like the glowing Motorola logo. My first initial is M. But the cord is a little short. I'd like to be able to talk while it's plugged, but it pulls on the outlet a little too much. I keep stretching out the coiled part, and eventually I think it will get loose enough. But for now 4 stars."
5,Works great,Great buy for the money. I have been using this charger for a couple of weeks and it works great.
2,Didn't fit,I guess maybe I should rate it higher but it didn't fit my W755. I think I needed a micro charger.
5,Asi es la musica con ELEFANTE,"Wow, tremendo discoLa verdad es uno de mis discos favoritos, todo el album esta lleno de sentido de poesia hasta algo de filosia. Elefante era un grupo que hacia falta no solo en Mexico sino en Latino America. Para ser su primer disco merece mas que 5 estrellas.'ASI ES LA VIDA' se a convertido en el himno de muchos que andamos en busca de buena musica y letras y Elefante da eso y mas en su primer album..... gracias por salir a la luz y compartir con nosotros 'el que busca encuentra'.....r.h."
5,Great for Students of SPanish,"I love the music of Elefante. I'm a perpetual student of Spanish and find the music is fun and the words are interesting, poetic and most importantly--intelligible! Take a listen!"
5,Kelly's Chance #1,I really enjoyed this book.I love reading Wanda Brunsterrer book. She always keeps you wondering what will happen next. This is the first book of a series and can't wait to read the next two.
4,To me this is a terrific romance for a younger reader.,"I really enjoyed this book. It was set in the Lehigh Canal and I learned much about a life I didn't even think about before. It is shocking to me how they lived and the work that people endured. (That some still endure.)I really liked the characters - well, the ones we were supposed to like - and felt that their story was very sweet and romantic. One who hopes to get married and is waiting for God to show her the path she should take - or the patience she should be utilizing!"
2,"Predictable, yet no plot",Where was the plot? I feel like the author was completely focused on her characters and forgot to include a plot. The character development wasn't satisfying. Did either of the main characters have a flaw? Mike tries to rush Kelly's feelings. Is that a flaw? Kelly assumes all men are like her father: overbearing and selfish. Is that really a flaw? At least there was no cheesy conversion scene...
2,BORED,I feel this book was drawn out far too long. You knew from the first chapter was was going to happen. I enjoy most of Brunstetters books. This one just did not compare to her other writings.
3,Kelly's Chance,"Predictable. Not Wanda Brunstetter's best works! I got bored with it. I'm hoping that whn I finish it, I will completely change my mind."
3,Christian Metal,This is collection of various 80's Heavy Metal Christian. The recordings were done in analog originally so the quality of sound is not as crisp as todays music. All in all it is a pretty good cd.
4,The Life of Chico Mendez,"The Burning Season is a wonderful film about the life and struggles of Chico Mendez. Chico (played by Raul Julia) fought his entire life to save the Amazon from ranchers and miners that wanted to cut it down. He lived a very peaceful life in Brazil as a seringueiro or rubber tapper until the cattle ranchers and miners took over his land and destroyed it. Mendez was a pioneer for the start of many efforts to save the rain forests. Unfortunately, his efforts were cut short when the son of a cattle rancher shot and killed him at his home. The movie does a great job of making viewers aware of what is happening in Brazil and how much destruction of the Amazon rain forests actually takes place."
3,not good enough,Bought this specific sprayer so I can use air compressor to pressurize it. Top nipple of pressure relief valve broke off first time sprayer used which makes releasing pressure manually very difficult. Metal rings for strap broke when filled sprayer picked up first time. Sprayer works OK otherwise.
5,Perfect for standing healthcare workstations,"I purchased several of these for the treatment rooms in our chiropractic clinic and they work perfectly.From a stability and weight-bearing standpoint, I should note that we're using wall-mounted HP TouchSmart 600's. So, there is little to no weight on this workstation in our office. We use it for holding files/xrays, the keyboard/mouse, a few supplies on the lower shelf.Aesthetically, it gives a very nice impression. We've gotten lots of compliments from patients about how sleek and professional they look.I also bought 2 of the Safco 1929's, but I like the Euroflex better. The SAF1929 has a higher writing surface, but the Euroflex takes up less room space, looks MUCH better, costs less, and assembles easier."
5,nicole is great!!,"even though i am still young i really like nicole c. mullen's music. i own two of her cd's and i want to own this one and one other. i think she does music for all ages and they are really easy, fun , and inspirational.thanks nicole!"
2,uncertain,I really like nicole c mullen. I have her albums and was looking for some dvds to add to my collection so when I saw she had one I jumped at it. I love her voice and enthusiasm but the dvd was too 80s for me. I normally don't mind the era or decade christian music comes from but I couldn't finish it. Not that it was bad just not what I was looking for. Had I bought it 15 years ago I may have enjoyed it more. Still like her though
3,cheap plastic,"You get what you pay for, high pressure blows them; dogs think they are chew toys, I should have stuck with metal"
4,Wicca For Couples-Excellent!!,"Wicca for Couples by AJ Drew is, in my opinion, a must read for any and all Wicca couples and for those that will someday be a couple. Drew makes the fine point that the cornerstone of Wicca is the family and offers advice on Wicca for that family.I read Wicca for Couples and immediatley shared it with my wife. The book gave rise to many, many discussions that allowed us to realign our relationship. We were close to celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary at the time. We continue to use Wicca for Couples as a guide in our magical and mundane relationship.I heartfully recommend Wicca for Couples.Blessed Be,"
1,NOT a good book on the ways of Wicca,"I would NOT in any way recommend this book to anyone thinking of entering the path of Wicca. This book does NOT tell all. This book and it's ""author"" knows not the ways of the old. Seax Wica is still practiced today. Dr. Buckland was in the Gardnerian tradition for TWELVE YEARS before he founded the Seax Wica tradition. StewarD Farrar's name is StewarT. His name is Stewart not Steward. Get all of the names correct as well as the ways of Wicca. I am not satisifed at all with the book and would not recommend it to anyone. I would give it NO stars! But I didn't have that option.Bright BlessingsNicks"
5,Helpful in a lot of ways,It is helping my marriage grow stronger and helping me to communicate with my husband on another level and helping me show more understanding towards his needs and wants and desires.. It really is a great book...
1,Just more of the same trite,"A.J. is to modern Paganism as Howard Stern is to radio. If you want to read an over inflated ego that loves to try and shock you by exaggerating and/or embellishing on unsupported or extremely dated information, then by all means read this man's books. If, on the other hand, you want something that is alot more factual and substantial, then stay away. If I need drama in my life, I just watch the Bravo channel on tv, I don't turn to tabloid style trite that tries to pass itself off as serious research/advice. A.J. hasn't had a serious relationship in years, so I can think of alot more advantageous sources of relationship information for Pagan couples out there.For the record, I am not a large fan of Buckland either, but at least he doesn't try to be sensational and controversial just for the attention. Maybe A.J. should write for the Enquirer or Sun, those publications seem more his style."
5,Insightful AND Witty!,"This book covers all the major elements in making, keeping, breaking relationships, as well as humourously looking at other pagan/wiccan authors and their ""lack of love"" in the modern american movement."
3,Where is the part on Wicca for Couples?,"If I was rating this book strictly on the title I would have to give it a poor mark. More like the authors dissertation on what is wrong with Wicca and how he would fix it, there isn't a lot of content about ""Wicca for Couples"".It should be re-titled and marketed more appropriately for the content. The author does make a lot of good points and has strong arguments that are unfortunately lost in the mix of this particular book.However the few rituals included are well thought out and could be a very nice starting point for developing your own."
2,"Good car, bad CD player","I bought this for my 6 yr. old and the CD player was her favorite part of the toy. However, she said that if she tried to walk with the CD playing or listen to it while we were in the car, it would constantly stop playing. I'm going to buy her a better quality CD player that won't skip or stop playing when it's moved."
3,Weak Metal,"The post came in the time frame promised and in great condition. The extra long seat post was purchased since I am very tall and needed to raise the seat on my bike. However, after only a short time the post had a bend in it and could no longer be adjusted. I only weigh 75 kg."
3,Generally OK,"Generally this book is ok. The content of the book covers all the features of Reporting Services, which is good.There aren't a lot of examples, but there are still some useful ones.The only thing really frustrating is some of the custom code examples flat out DO NOT WORK!Overall decent, good information, but not very deep."
1,Poor content. Not useful at all,"I have read all the SRS2005 books, and by far, this is the worst. There is hardly any useful information in this. Not a book that you can use as a real-world reference. There is no meat in there. I would recommend either Wrox or Brian Larson's book instead."
1,Ficha equivocada,"Yo pensé que era un resumen de la telenovela interpretada por Jeannette Rodríguez y Jorge Martínez ""Micaela"" de 1992 pero no lo es.Se trata de una película infantil."
1,Most rediculous thing I have ever heard.,This is the most rediculous cd I have ever listened to. I still haven't quite figured out how they got a recording contract. Well I could think of a few things but they would probably get censored on here. If someone wants to pay you to take this cd then its worth it but otherwise I wouldn't pay even a penny for it. What a waste of plastic.
5,Every Designer NEEDS this book!,"This is the book that was missing in college. So what makes the difference between Wow and O.K. Read it, study it, do the excersizes... follow it. I wish every hobbist in the digital scrapbook world would discover this book.Jim Krause is one of THE BEST teachers of our time."
5,"Perfect for any designer, beginner or expert.","This guide walks you through the basics and uses examples every step of the way. Most books like to use concepts or discuss the actual methods of design where as this book actually gives you the information you need to go beyond concepts and well into the world of graphic design. This book is invaluable in terms of resourcefulness and useability on a day to day basis to anyone who has an interest / hand in graphic design. I also recommend the designers complete index, same author / publisher, as it is equally indispensable."
5,The best book on Graphic Design ever,"This book is, by far, the best book on graphic design ever. It cuts to the chase, has the most important essentials. Most books are filled with crap and are hard to read. Not this one. If you buy one book on graphic design, this better be it."
3,Jury's still out,"I ordered this book for a class. Since school began we've only had one assignment from the book so I really can't rate this book fairly from a technical point of view. I did consider using the book as a reference and the book does an workmanlike job on fleshing out some of the concepts, however, it did not fit with my concept of a resource book. In completing the assignment, the material could have been presented in an more engaging format. I am past my prime as regard being a student and perhaps this is how stuff works now-a-days. I'll reserve my opinion as neutral until I have more class time/resource check time to investigate it. Stay tuned!"
4,Great design resource,"This book is full of great examples, well-thought explanations and good practice problems. It is very well-organized and is full of ideas and examples that will get the beginner's graphic design mind going."
5,A Book to Hold on to!,"This book completely covers the basic design principles and shows in depth the application and usefulness of them. Not only does it do this effectively, but it's exciting to read! Overall the book is very easy to understand and could teach just about anyone how to design better. If you need a guide in design for any field, choose this one!"
5,A Favorite Resource Book,"After 15 years of running my own graphic design business, I don't refer to books too often but this one is a great tool for those days that you are just stuck.It is filled with a huge variety of concepts for playing with type, composition, photos, color, and basic layout. It is easy enough to look at one section or all of them.I am also an adviser to our local Career and Technology Center for high school students learning trades. This was my recommended book as a tool for the Commercial Art program. It not only has a ton of basic information but has many lessons and hands on activities to apply techniques. It would be a terrific learning tool for anyone just starting out.I'm already a fan of the ""index"" books. This is the top of the list."
5,"Great book! Small, flexible, and fun to read","I had to buy this book for school, but I love the way it's laid out. It's very colorful, very informative, and it's small size with a strong plastic cover makes it easy to take with you everywhere or throw in your purse.I have learned a lot from this book so far."
5,This is a great book for learning and enjoying homeopathy.,"In Materia Poetica, Sylvia expresses the feeling and the essence of homeopathic remedies in delightful poetry. It is a wonderful learning tool for students, and knowledgable homeoapths will appreciate it too."
4,Faced my storms,"The CD is good, but the best part is I Told The Storm. I listen to that song repeatedly when going through a difficult time. It is very moving. If you are having trouble facing your storm, this is the song for you."
2,Not the quality I was expecting,I suppose you get what you pay for but hope its better than that. Only hopes though.
1,Too small,"To whom it may concern:My shoes look fine. The problem is they are too small. I usually wear a 11 1/2"" B but I can't get these on. Never worn.Question: may I return these shoes and get credit for what I paid if I purchase another pair to replace them.Your reply is greatly appreciated.Rob Modlin704-689-2171PS: Can't change ""real name."" I am husband of Paitra M. Modlin; we use same credit card."
4,"Great looking, comfortable shoe",This is a great looking and comfortable shoe made in Italy that I was able to purchase for under $50. Very versatile and goes well with khakis and nice jeans.
4,Diaz vs. Gomi,"The Diaz/Gomi match, despite the post fight controversy, ranks as the most dramatic MMA match that I have ever seen. Throw in the Henderson/Silva match and this ranks as one of the best shows by any organization ever. Not impressed by Nick Diaz? You will be after seeing his heart against Gomi."
1,honest take on john,"As a recording engineer, I edit and listen (I mean really listen) to music everyday. I know a good voice when I hear one and John Mayer does NOT have a good singing voice. Honestly, it makes me want to gouge my ears out with a fork. His lyrics aren't that great either. As a guitar player, I know a good guitarist when I hear one and John Mayer IS a talented guitar player. John Mayer may be a passable guitarist, but he is a horrible singer and a mediocre songwriter...I think he stinks. He needs to shut his mouth and just play guitar. [...]"
1,"pathetic, derivative","this is utter drivel. the songs are forgettable, the playing is shoddy, the singing is repugnant, the recording quality is subpar.. below bootleg quality. Overally this is the worst album of the year , john mayer is the backstreet boys of the blues world."
2,well....hmmm,"i didnt know at first if this was good or not. I came to the conclusion it was less good than i first thought. Usually i know if an album is good if it either A.)knocks my socks off from first listen, or B.) grows on me with each consecutive listening. This record did neither for me. I listened through a few times and have not really felt like relistening to it very much. Just didnt intrigue me, or keep me very interested for long."
1,Copy Protection Prevents Listening,"Great music - on an old fashioned CD player. Forget listening on your computer, or exercising fair-use rights to listen on an MP3 player. The music is great but the medium is severly limited. I normally boycott crippled content like this - I never pirate music, only pay the price for those who do and who have caused the record industry to keep its customers in straight jackets.BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Who did you think he was?,"Wow this guy is shrewd. He establishes a fan base, a radio airplay base, an economic base, then comes out gunslinging with his rock and roll soul. What a feat. I LOVE this album. I certainly like the softer ""pop"" side of John Mayer and have purchased his prior CDs on that basis. However, I am an absolute Hendrix/Vaughn/Winter/Duarte/Kravitz texas blues style guitar acolyte, and the stuff on this CD just blows me away, ESPECIALLY coming from John Mayer. Sad to see some reviewers rating the CD poorly based on the pop parameters they'd like to see JM bound by. On the other hand, I do think it's reasonable to warn the young teenaged girl fans out there that this album is a (fantastic) departure."
3,Not that bad,"Certainly not album of the year - but the name of the cd is TRY! Kudos to John for doing what he wants do to, and not putting out another pop album despite the pressure to do so. There is a great version of Somethings Missing on here, and potential to expose some non traditional listeners to Blues."
5,John Mayer rocks,"I always knew he could 'feel', but now he rocks too. Anyone who thinks he can't sing needs to take a good listen to Stevie Ray Vaughn. There are times when you think you could be listening to the great SRV himself, but this IS a John Mayer album and is filled with his spirit."
5,Thank Goodness,"I think it's wonderfully rare that John Mayer can successfully go off and do his own thing in this blues-charged live album. Not many musicians can tread off the beaten path and then come back to win a Grammy. Unfortunately, he won for ""pop"" star, a title I'm sure he's not too thrilled about but has to accept.This album truly explores the blues style and virtuoso of John Mayer. And as a fan since he first appeared on the scene, I'm very happy with it. It fulfills my curiousity but leaves me asking for more."
4,Not the radio airplay John...,But still a great step in his evolution. Blues and jazz infused on some already released songs along with a few new ones in a live setting. Worth a TRY!
4,Great jam music,"Easy to listen to these jams and I really love the unplugged version of ""Fathers be good to your daughters."" A great cd to play when you have people over - it is appealing across different genres and I like to add it to the mix with several cds."
5,lovin' the new cd,"I loved John Mayer's music prior to this Cd, but I love it even more now. As a writer and an artist myself, I appreciate that Mayer can write, sing, and play his own music. Try! just goes to show how much Mayer and his sound have grown up- he's shedding his popstar image to remain true to the reason he first pursued music- blues. A neighbor once gave a young John Mayer a copy of a SRV tape and got him hooked on blues. On this CD, you can definitely see him putting his influences to good use. I especially loved ""Who Did You Think I Was"", ""Another Kind of Green"", ""Wait Until Tomorrow"", and ""Out of My Mind"". Am also looking forward to the release of his new album in spring of 2006."
2,"second the ""Try"" harder concept,,,","John is a decent (although obviously ""taught"") guitar player. the songs on this album come off as formulaic and unremarkable. As mentioned earlier his vocals are way too fluffy to give weight to songs of this nature . If you want music like this look to the originators, or at least someone like Mato from Indigenous (if you want someone living..). I know he has passion for the music, but i dont feel he has the soul to do it justice."
5,Loved it,"I really really like this album, I loved the ""old"" John Mayer if thats what you call it, but I think that this new stuff is great, and I think that he is such a diverse artist he can really play anything, maybe some people don't like it because it not true ""blues"", but this album is John's own style he has always had kind of his own thing going. I think that it's great and I listen to it everyday. I just love how real of his songs are. After seeing him live you know that this is the real thing, he loves what he does. I love it, definatley one to buy for the collection."
5,"Mellow, enriching and fun.","This album was great a nice departure into Blues by a rising, hot star. John Mayer is an extremely talented guitar player, having seen him live several times I can attest to this. This album is not as radio friendly as his previous efforts, but you can't deny his wanting to explore what he likes. Mellow, enriching and fun."
2,A technical horror show.,"John Mayer Trio's music is great. I saw their concert in NYC where they ""introduced"" this album...it was awesome. But, whoever recorded and mixed this CD should have his hands chopped off. One of the worst sounding CD's I've ever heard. If you enjoy John Mayer TRY something else."
5,John Mayer at His Best,"John Mayer has really matured since his first breakout in 2003?? The music on this cd is really outstanding ... different genres (blues, jazz, rock) without putting the listner in a totally different mood.Buy this one- you won't be sorry."
5,On The Horizon,"Take note folks...........John Mayer and his new trio are easily the next SRV, Hendrix, Clapton, or whomever you covet. This kid is leaving the teen-idol-angst world and has entered into living legend. Its about time he chooses to show the world what he is capable of and he's only scraped the tip of the iceburg on this album. Those of you who've seen him live three to four times know what I mean. This album is a fantastic first step and hopefully he'll churn out fifty more just like it or better! I am definitely a new ""Mayer Faithful."""
4,Great CD,"I really enjoy this CD. The musicianship is top notch and the songs have a bluesy, rock sound. One thing that could have been improved is the quality of the recording (although this gives it an attractive grittiness). Favorite tracks include ""Another Kind of Green"" and ""Good Love is On the Way"".Mayer proves he is not just another pretty boy by proving he can keep up with both Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Palladino on bass. He is a very good guitar player who can sing as well.If I had to again, I would buy this CD."
4,Excellent Live Album!,"John Mayer is a "" Very Good"" guitarist..I've seen and been into so many guitarist that sometimes it's hard to be fair in a review, but I saw him last year in Virginia Beach when I was on vacation and he was ""very"" good. So if your just getting into him and don't want the ""pop"" records this would be a good start, it has a mix of both pop and some nice blues riffs with a great backup band.Highlights for me are:GravityOut of My MindI got a Woman"
5,JMT Can Tour the Midwest Any Time!,"This CD was recommended to me by a friend who liked the idea that John Mayer was making music simply, with only 3 people, yet powerfully. Without going track by track, this was definitely worth the money and if JMT comes to Chicago, we'll be there! You can feel the energy, the audience is heard from time to time but doesn't take anything away from the music. All Mayer fans should have this piece."
3,middle of the road,"ive heard better, ive heard worse. this is OKAY music, it didnt make me jump up and take notice, but also it didnt make me vomit. I hope he gets a gutsier on his next album. This was sorta weak in my opinion, singing could defenitely have been stronger, not very bluesy...still very throaty akin to his pop records. Not very suited to the blues. Good effort though. Keep trying mayer, you might do better next time."
2,"""Something's missing""... definitely!","Being a John Mayer fan, I was excited when I heard he was releasing a new album. The aspect of ""Trio"" made it all the more intruiging. When I finally did get a chance to take a listen, I was rather disappointed. To me, good sound quality must accompany good music. The sound quality of this cd was between poor and unacceptable. The distortion from the recording made it almost unlistenable at parts, even solos which I was really looking forward to. The CD felt like a rush job and is a big ""miss"" by Mayer. This totally inhibited my ability to judge the actual music objectively... I will try to give it another listen and see in the near future."
1,I thought Vanilla Fudge disbanded,"Carmine Appice would be proud. For many, this is a sound that has been twenty years in the making--a musical melding of Iron Butterfly and early-era Rod Stewart."
3,Eh,"Bought this CD primarily for one song and after a month or so it's the one that I primarily listen to :) ( I got a woman)Maybe I should have gotten it for 99c from I-tunesNot a bad album, but not GREAT imho."
3,it's aight',"man this cat jammed okay for me, coulda been harder up on the riffs tho. Singin wasnt gruff enough for my taste. Good but not great."
2,"i agree , not the next great bluesman","I hate hearing how John Freaking Mayer is supposed to be so awesome. I downloaded some of the songs on this disc, and boy am I glad I didnt waste my money on this. Bored to tears was the best way to describe how i felt while listening."
2,Another 'Live' bust from John,"I believe John to be a very good live performer but just once I would like him to produce something where a buck or two was actually spent on the sound quality of the production. Yeah I get that the screaming young girls are all part of the 'experience' but the sonic quality always sounds absolutely horrible. I'm a fan, and all the more as his body of work grows and matures, just give us something that doesn't sound like it was recorded through a microphone smuggled into the concert concealed in the bra of one of his teenage fans."
3,"A nice step, just tone down the SRV influence","Hey, this is nice to see; John Mayer really exlporing some blues roots. I'm a big blues fan, and Stevie Ray is one of my biggest influences when I play guitar. However, they should have called this a SRV tribute album! Now, the track, Out of your Mind is a nice non-Stevie blues song that shows how mature some of his blues voicings can be. I agree with some other people on here, his voice doesn't quite fit, but I'm guessing that will improve. Also, he definately copies Stevie's vocals on here, which I don't think is necessary. I guess there is something infectious about playing the blues with that great Strat sound that makes you want to play SRV, Hendrix style, God knows I do at times. But take it down a notch John, it's very transparent. It's a step in the right direction however, and I applaude the move. Let's see what they do next on the next album, because I don't think they could get away with this same style again. Good luck Trio!!!"
4,The Best of Mayer By Far!!!,"I've been following Mayer since his Room for Squares album. I like all his stuff, but have found that this album tends to hold my interest for a longer period of time. The others were entertaining, but this album hits your senses in a way the others didn't quite accomplish. His new songs, Vultures and Gravity, which will also appear on his next release, ""Continuum"" are in my opinion his very best. I couldn't stop playing Vultures for weeks!!!!I guess I'm out of the loop. I've been reading a few reviews and was surprised by the amount of controversy surrounding this guy. Why everybody feels the need to crown or crucify him is bewildering to me. Just take the music for what it's worth. He's a great songwriter and a fantastic muscian.P.S. I meant to give this 5 Stars. Sorry. :)"
3,in praise of guitar-driven pop,"The reviews here are sharply divided. I don't feel like repeating the inevitable comparisons, but hey guys: lighten up! Let's celebrate the return of real GUITAR to front and center. I gig around Chicago with a trio, we play material by Di Meola, Mc Laughlin et al. I know what it's like to be compared to the gods. It's rough. Think back only a few years when the only thing passing for music was Spice Girls. John Mayer COULD HAVE stayed bubble-gum with ""Your Soul is a Jungle-Gym""; instead, he's rocking out. Go, go Johnny, go!"
1,"If you expect to be rattled as if by SRV, be diappointed","Typical effort by someone who's obviously been influenced by the great ones (SRV, Hendrix...)and has alot of talent but has absolutely no soul. He can play some licks but is unable to put them together to provide the needed meaning and depth which this bluesy type of music demands. Spend your money on the lesser known greats such as Buddy Guy, Son Seals, or Magic Slim. This guy is overrated"
2,passable effort,"this just bearly made me want to listen to every song. Pretty banal and boring for the most part. Decent guitar work, mediocre songwriting. This jimi cover was nowhere near as good as the original. Worth listening to if you like john mayer and all his ugly facial expressions, but for people who like gritty blues rock this comes off as a tad wimpy."
2,"he tried, i suppose","i didnt think this was very memorable. I only gave it 2 stars cause i think he really does like this music , and wants to play it,...i just think he doesnt realise he cant do it very well. I think John is deluding himself."
1,Stevie Ray Fawn...,"SRV was a special musician, who somehow managed to transcend his more than obvious influences.John Mayer is an avowed SRV acolyte who seems to think that apeing Stevies vocal and guitar style will give him some ""cred""There is a surplus of flashy blues licks here, but one cannot escape the feeling that SRV is as deep as Mayer has dug. Blues is more than licks and ""attitude"".SRV clones are ten a penny, and even Mayers acoustic pop flummery is preferable to this woefully accurate impersonation.Save your ten bucks and buy a Guitar Slim CD."
1,go listen to real blues,"basically... john mayer is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! i've heard him compared to the likes of SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I like tracks 2, 4, and 5, the rest I don't care for. Raw honkytonk/blues/jazz/whatever is not what I want to hear from John Mayer. It seems like this is just a self-indulgent thing thrown together for kicks, which I guess is what live albums are supposed to be, but since they're mostly new songs I expected something more. It's been suggested that his last two albums weren't where his passion was, but if he really had this music in him the whole time I can't believe he would have held it back for so long. I guess it's possible that this is an artistic evolution he's been working towards, but I expect and hope that ""raw blues guy"" will prove to be just a character he plays on weekends, a minor diversion from his true calling, as a master craftsman of harmonic, melodic, catchy pop songs."
1,A Sad attempt to play the blues,"This CD is a disgrace to the legandary blues singers of the past such as Ruth Brown, BB King, Buddy Guy, and John Lee Hooker. The fact that people buy this trash and call John a legend is a disgrace. Every song on this cd lacks any feeling or ""blues."" Mato Nanji of Indigenous, John's peer is a much better performer and his music has more substance. I suggest that all blues fans check Indigenous out and leave John's trash right where it belongs, on the shelf collecting dust."
1,am i listening to the same album as you people!!?!?!?,"I keep hearing the words ""emotion"" and ""passion"" and ""raw"" and all manner of crap to describe this recording. Well i couldnt DISAGREE more ! I dont hear any of those things. I hear tired cliches of the blues, smeared with a heaping helping of john mayer's arrogance and a side of poor songwriting and singing. I'm getting sick to my stomach just thinking about it."
1,"Flat, boring , pretentious","...The cat's got no soul. He's like a cardboard cutout . His sound is completely derivative , and in no way unique or innovative. He can play some decent stuff...but is is all like as if im listening to someone playing back all the riffs they know like theyre some kind of living tape player. And dont get my started on his breathy singing , which while okay for pop, is totally weak for blues/rock. Keep ""trying"" john, maybe another 10 years you may have something to say thats not a total rip-off."
2,The Truth about TRY!,"...When I heard that Mayer was putting out a blues album, i was very anxious to hear what he could do, especially with the ""trio"" aspect, which implied a purist approach. I like that. But therein lies the problem. I had heard about a BLUES album. This is not a blues album. As the artist clearly indicated, this is a pop album intended to introduce blues elements. John Mayer knows his audience very well. To put out something raw and traditional like a genuine blues guitar album would place Mayer in the poor house. I commend him on this album for emphasizing these elements. And although the album does not appeal to those outside the mainstream, i hope we may soon see some real blues from the young pop-star. Frankly, the guy doesn't need to lay down any more groundwork in the radio-friendly arena if he's ready to live up to any of the guitar legend allusions concerning his technique. Some of which i believe absurd, as many compare him to stevie Ray. Even Mayer knows thats wrong."
2,pretty much what i expected,"i came into this expecting to be underwhelmed, well ..in fact , i was. I have heard some killer guitar players in my day...dudes with serious tone, timing, and soul. Now the kid has SOME chops, but he has got a long road to hoe in order to ever have any hope of living up to our universally recognised guitar heroes. A marginal first attempt at making this kind of record for him. I would honestly be more interested to see what kind of stuff in this vein he can pull off in the studio, since his live stuff to me is fairly pedestrian for this genre."
4,Great Value! Thank you for not price gouging!,I was very impressed by the price of this product. It is nice to know there are some fair pricing individuals out there! Bravo!
3,Will the real John Mayer please stand up?,"Donald Fagan put out the great album called ""Morph The Cat"" but it wasn't about John Mayer. Perhaps that should have been the title to this album. It seems John Mayer does his best to morph into SRV, Jimi, and for some unexpainable reason Dave Matthews (a sound nobody should aspire to), as well as others. Quite obviously the kid can play the guitar very well and sing with feeling, but I'd really be curious to hear him discover who John Mayer really is, cause I can't find that out from this album. All that aside, it's an imminently listenable album with moments that shine."
4,Good stuff...add it to your collection.,"Feels like I'm listening to Stevie Ray at times. That is a compliment. Mayer may not have the skills, or maybe he does, as other legendary blues musicians but the group on stage does a great job. He is still a young guy and one day we will look back and appreciate his music even more."
5,World needs more woven,I love it. My roommates love it. The people I work with love it. The buried track is beautiful. The world needs more Woven.Pieces.
5,Incredible,"Just finished listening to Woven E-Prime all I can say is WOW!Each song a diffrent journey through the various flavours of Woven, all each containing truly diverse styles truly Woven together in marvelously inspiring ways. This CD is a great masterpiece, one of many more to come I hope.I cannot get the words nor the tunes of these songs out of my head. Addictive, lushly marvelous.Thank you Woven for the music and Inspiration!The world needs more of this, much much more!"
5,Good set...great price,"Great all-around set of screwdrivers, nicely weighted and the grips are comfortable enough. I bought 1 set for work and 1 for my garage. Good assortment too."
2,Quantity not Quality,Plenty of screwdrivers in this deal. Cosmetically they look great with the black tips. However the metal is soft and they are not going to last long. Stick with Craftsman hand tools.
2,"Save the drama, buy Craftsman","I bought this set of screwdrivers because I needed a torx with a long shaft. Amazon, as usual with Prime, delivered in two days.I opened the box.I unwrapped foam sheet packing material and found the screwdrivers poking through. No pouch, nothing. Just screwdrivers. Just slightly rusty screwdrivers.A bit of 3-in-1 oil brightened them up.They're made in China of course.They warn the handles are not insulated against electric shock.Only warranty I could find in the box is Amazon's 30 day return policy.I'd return them but it's too much bother. Next time I'll just buy Craftsman locally."
1,Poor Quality,"Marginal screwdrivers. Metal is soft and don't let the black paint on the tips fool you. Installed 12 phillips screws in sheet metal, by the 10th screw the point was rounding. All show and no go!"
2,double tank water gun,"Good idea but weak durability..after 1st session of squirting, no water would pump through and therefore no more squirting!!"
1,"Great Magazine, but don't get it from Amazon","I paid Amazon for a 52 week subscription and received a 39 week subscription. I didn't find this out, of course, until about week 42 when I realized that I hadn't had an issue in a few weeks. It took hours on the phone for them to even to find out this information.Here's what you are doing when you buy this:Order through Amazon, Amazon gives your money to Magazine Express, Magazine Express buys a subscription from Hola. This means that if there is a problem you have to wait forever for them to go through the entire chain of people.By the way, you can order Hola from www.hello.com and PAY LESS (just a few dollars, but it IS cheaper)."
1,ANGRY!!!!!!!!!,"It is June 6, 2011 and i still have not receive my order from MArch 3rd I was suppose to receive my 1st issue in April and still waiting. I have tried to contact someone twice already for a refund and still no luck...I am so angry becuase I want to get a refund but no one can't email me back!!!!Please can someone tell me how to get ahold of someone???thank you!!Frustrated!!!"
4,its not bad,yugi and tea go to the domino museam here they meet a egypian named isheizo. she tells yugi about what happened 5 thousand years ago and yugi finds out that the spirit of his puzzle is named yami. she tells yugi that he must rescue mankind once again and a duel monsters tournament is about to begin. so yugi enters the tournamnet. this also has two other episodes stalked by the rare hunters and yugi vs. the rare hunter part 1
3,Ok i guess,"I've seen these episodes on kids' WB(t.m.) but these episodes are the weirdest ones yet in the vhs/dvd volumes. I dont get the dancing episode, which ends up in a stupid duel, with Johnny Steps giving up. Most Anime' is about friendship, and so is this, but too much of Yu-Gi-Oh! can brainwash you. (I mean that in the best way possible because i am a Yu-Gi-Oh! Freak.) A great present for a birthday or a get well or something."
1,UGH!,"Do NOT buy this version! Get the japanese import version. Like one reviewer said, they edited it up sooooooooooooooo much it ain't even funny!"
3,"Good reeds, but inconsistent","In a box of five reeds, you might find one that is solo performance worthy. The rest will be decent for practice and ensemble playing. Every few boxes you will actually find a chipped or unusably-deformed reed. I will take that one perfect reed over other brands, and it will last for months, but it's hard to justify paying that much for one reed."
3,"Good book but no vertex,fragment introduction.","I've bought this book which is good for learning OpenGL 1.4, but be carefull if you want to learn vertex,fragment programs: contrary to what is written on the cover, this book doesn't talk at all about vertex,fragment programs.The sentence ""Most importantly, the ARB vertex and fragment program extension is introduced."" is an editorial mistake..To learn to program shaders, you'll need another book.."
3,At best is mere entertainment,"Fast moving storyline, however very little is plausible. The cockiness of the main character, Sam Teacher, and his unbelievable feats of accomplishments make the paperback a western fantasy read."
4,Exciting!,"This is a good book. It's kind of slow for the first bit but it unravles into a very exciting story. An Alien switches over Will's body, wich at first is great for Will because he was a total geek and the alien is pretty popular(But of course the kids don't know he is an alien.). But that does not last long. For the alien won't let him have his own body back. Soon Will finds out why, and by that time he's wishing that he never wanted to be someone else"
3,"Not Bad, Not Good","When Chad Miller Said To Will That He Has A Swithching Machine, Will Wants It. But Chad's Family Is Not Normal Infact They Are Aliens. If They Find People They Will Mind Tailoring Them"
5,"Awesome, great, great OVA series!!","This is a real good series, if you like Crest of the Stars, Heavy Metal L-Gaim, or any Leiji Matsumoto based series you will enjoy this. The animation is top notch the action is great the story is great, the characters are interesting. I wish the original Orguss was out on R1 dvd so I could see more of this world known as Orguss. It really got me thinking of Heavy Metal L-Gaim while I was watching this, it just has a similar feeling to it. Get this DVD it is actually a bargain at this price as it contains the entire 6 episode OVA."
3,Coffee table book,Not enough to just sit down and read. It has some nice ads but would only be good for a coffee table book. I might just cut it up and use the pictures for crafts.
5,Darling Steiff Chimpanzee,"I bought Bamboo the Steiff chimpanzee last week on Amazon for only $19.26. Was I surprised to see it selling today for $45.79. I'm so glad I bought when I did. Bamboo is a darling stuffed toy, extremely soft, and is a large 14"" tall, perfect for cuddling. Wish I had bought a few more at the bargain price to save for gifts!"
5,Pull up projector screen,I am happy with my screen. It doesn't look portable yet it as porttable as a tripod style screen. It has quality construction with a good manufacturer should you ever need any parts replaced. The 80 inch screen fits into my SUV just fine but appears to large for even a full size car.
1,"Elite Screens EZ Cinema Floor Pull Up Projection Screen, 16:9 Aspect Ratio-135in. (Max White)",The Screen came damaged and the glue that holds the screen and housing body together came un-glue.Will not recommend to anyone.
2,Not portable,This is listed as a portable screen. It doesn't even come remotely close to fitting in my rather large car. It is far from portable. I can't comment on other features.
3,Ok,"Unlike similar models this one has screw legs protruding on both ends along with a swivel out foot in the middle. If you slide it into your truck and a leg catches on anything, it will tear out from the very thin metal case.Only bottom half of case is metal. Top case is plastic.Not a road warrior worthy piece of equipment.Good screen material and image.Nice self tensioning bar across top."
2,Nice idea. Poor manufacturing and quality assurance.,"This screen had severe ripples across the top of the screen. Resulting in extreme ripples in the image.(Screen was to be used only for Keynote presentations). Completely unacceptable even for a Keynote presentation.During manufacturing the screen material was trapped unevenly in the top ""metal bar"". How this passed quality assurance, I have no idea.Quality was so bad I was afraid to try another unit.(I left it open for a couple of days to see if ripples would be reduced due to being openrather than wound up in base). There was no improvement.Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy."
1,Broken and Restocked!,"Ordered a Elite EZ Cinema Screen (135 in.) from ReStock It. The screen is designed to be hung from one poorly made supporting bar with a PLASTIC bracket at the top. Way too much weight to hang from one little piece. The bracket arrived already broken and the brackets to hold the bar inside the travel case were also already snapped. No way this can be blamed on shipping damage. Someone at ReStock It obviously didn't inspect before putting it into their inventory! Learned my lesson about buying ""gently used"" or ""open box"" items!"
5,Most epic metal album of all time!!!,This is the most epic metal album of all time!!! No matter what your favorite genre is get this album! It's not black metal like there earlier stuff. Instead it's an epic tale full of imagery and story telling. I highly recommend this!
5,The realization of perfection,Bathory's Hammerheart is simply the culimination of all that metal has ever sought to achieve.
5,When the wind calls out my name ..,"the only music i`ve heard where i`m transported to earlier times ,preparing a dragon ship ,crashing over cold waves, distant lands on the horizon. This has an atmosphere all to itself,cold,haunting, melodic,passionate.Thankyou Quorthon , you,ve gave me something special..... When the wind cries out my nameAnd time has come for me to dieThen wrap me in my capeAnd lay my sword down at my side ..."
4,practical & easy to read,"I just finished up the coursework for my teaching certification and found this book to be the most useful, user-friendly text I was assigned during the program. I hesitate to call it a textbook, because it's a thin, easy-to-read, conversational book, but it gets the point across clearly: math is all around us. Children need to learn basic math skills, but teaching them to think, value their thinking and problem solve in real-world situations is equally valuable. She gets the point across using examples most of us can relate to. I hope to use this book as a reference and reminder throughout my teaching"
2,cogent and misguided,"Burns is both right and wrong. She is right that a really good math teacher can teach ideas and make children like math without all of the drilling. I am sure that she herself has experienced this and perhaps taught other math teachers to do the same. But the approach assumes math teachers are more talented than most are. With less talented teachers her approach is a disaster. Students learn neither the ideas nor the basics, like the multiplication tables, that the less talented teachers could have taught. The result is high schoolers who need to count on their fingers to multiply six times seven."
2,Not for wee ones.,"Some of the Little Golden Books are ideal for little bitty kids, and some are not. This one is not. The pictures on all the pages are indistinguishable from one to the next, and indistinguishable in and of themselves. They're busily depicting firehouse activities in a way that is meaningless to a really little kid.And then, actually to the credit of the authors/editors, there are no really defined depictions of the fires, which leads to confusion about what the fuss is over. I appreciate that it is difficult to pleasantly depict what firemen do but this book was a pretty bad exposition of it. Perhaps this book is better for kids who are 5 or 6 yrs old, but it's alternately scary and uninteresting/confusing for pre-schoolers. Don't buy for a really little one."
5,Action-packed pictures on every page.,"My son's favorite book. Every page has so much detail, he is enthralled and loves to read/look over and over again. A nice change of pace from today's children's books which are much more simple in their design. P.S.--Note that the fire chief looks like Tom Dewey (as in ""Dewey defeats Truman"")!"
4,Chrstas present,Bought for our grandson who loves trains and he very much enjoys looking atit and having it read to him.
3,A good classic,"This is a good Classic Little Golden Book. The pictures are bright and fun, and it shows just enough of the fireman life for little ones. There are definitely others I enjoy more, but it's not bad."
3,Okay,The book is cute. The problem is the pictures do not fill the full screen on my Ipad so it is disappointing. The pictures are great and it would be nice to view them full screen.
5,Loves it!,"We borrowed this book from the library at least 3 times, and each time it has kept my 2-year old son's interest and he reads it multiple times in one sitting. We decided it was a keeper for his collection. He still likes this book and reaches for it at least twice a week and sometimes even ""reads"" it in the car. He studies the pictures and sometimes points to objects he recognizes and yells out their names. What is great about this book for the parent: you don't have to follow the story line. I just point and improvise using the pictures, which then makes reading this book a lot less monotonous. Great buy, and depending on the age of the child, I strongly suggest the board book version over the hardcover."
4,Cute movie,"Some parts are slow, but my 5 y.o. asks to watch it every week. By far the ""what a king wants"" song really makes the movie."
2,One Night with the King,"I didn't like this movie really. It was almost typical of what hollywood does when they either don't have the facts as to the events they are using as a basis for the movie, or they prefer to change it according to their belief system. Believe me, the bible account is quite exciting enough. I am particularly fond of this account for oh so many reasons. I noticed that this was popular, and without really paying attention to the product notes, I got sucked into looking at it. I would only recommend others see this movie to compare with another to see the difference. The problem is, when you see the other (as there are a number of these movies out there), you really don't want to revisit this one again."
3,A good read from a New voice,"Sam Yarney has published two novels. In this one, he is most akin to Frank Peretti, not just in theme but in writing style. In the sequel (""Air Rage"") he creates a story reminiscent of the better works of Tom Clancy (without the Tourette's-like smattering of compulsive and useless profanity Clancy currently writes with).Yarney weaves a great story, with a great point behind it (I can only say ""the power of prayer"" without giving away too much of the book) and fascinating characters. The book does suffer from some underdeveloped side characters and some atrocious type-setting. Still, I recommend you read this one and the sequel, for the sum is better than the parts!"
4,Ninety Days was gripping!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Ninety Days! A book I couldn't put down once I started - a quick paced, action-packed adventure. The characters were enticing and well developed - I could feel what they felt - a little romance too. The characters traveled to all parts of the globe and it was exciting to feel like I was there with all the detailed descriptions of the locations. Ninety Days was also intellectually stimulating through all the mystery and intrigue. I would highly recommend reading Ninety Days! Looking forward to a sequel!!"
4,Bruce is kick A$s,Bruce Dickinson is awesome. Without him Iron Maiden wouldn't have been as popular as they were then and are now. His solo stuff is great to. His greatest hits Cd rocks! my favorite song is Tears of the dragon. Anyone who is a die hard to the soul hard rocker or heavy metalist needs to buy this album!
4,Helpful!,"This was helpful. The index of plants that work in shade were good. Lots of pictures, little words-judge for yourself if that will work for you."
4,Japanese Modern Metal,"If you were somehow able to combine Pantera, Fear Factory, Mnemic, and a pinch of mudvayne; Sun's Owl would be your result. These guys have been around for sometime in Japan and have yet to make it stateside yet. Though, if ""Dir en grey"" can make it over here, then I'm sure it's only a matter of time for Suns Owl to make it way over here. ""Aim High"" is ther single from the album and does the job of showing what they have to offer. Great job. Lyrics are in full english aswell. The video for ""Aim High"" is available to view on many video streaming sites (youtube, etc...)"
5,Love! love!,"I love the bards in general and happily saw them every chance I got when they played at I-Con (a convention in New York). This CD is great to listen to and has my all time favorite bards song...""lusty young smith"" (and no it is not about being a black smith)"
4,Get this album,"If you like music of the type that you would have heard if you were born a celt a few years back or at a rennasaice festival now, this album is for you. The music is great, and the quality is excellent. This album is a must have for celtic music lovers. Even better, if you get the chance, see this group perform live--they bring a joy to life that reminds me of why music is important in our lives."
2,Don't get too excited about this one,If you are looking for all around quality I would advise you to pass on this one. Although lyrical content is Manafest's strongest asset the CD is lacking on the production and innovation levels. Unfortunatly most gospel Hip-Hop artists have quite a ways to go to match those of the secular world in terms of a quality product in whole. If you are not too picky you may wanna check it out. Peace -J. Mathews
4,Very cool heavy rock tunes...,"This is the third solo album from the hugely talented legendary guitarist of Texan rock band KING'S X. He is known for his amazing smoldering wild guitar riffs and solos but here, on his solo work he tends to slow it down. It is all about great well written tunes here, with good guitar riffs, ctachy choruses and very unique vocals. There are many fine tunes here, and it is probably his most rocking solo album, but still retains the more laid back cool vibe his his solo work. Very good classic radio rock sounds."
4,Keys? What Keys?,"I'm quickly becoming an avid Ruth Rendell fan and after a slow beginning, gradually got into this book. But, I have to ask: What the heck does the title mean? And who was the killer? Am I dense? How was he able to hoist his victims onto the spikes? These are questions I simply must have the answers to so I can sleep at night... if someone out there can supply them, please do! I do agree with another reviewer that her attention to ""geographical minutae"" gets a bit laborious at times and I did skip through several paragraphs of tedious description. Perhaps I missed a vital clue as to the identity of the killer? My favorite Rendell novel so far is A Sight for Sore Eyes. Check it out for purely venomous, evil characters! I've never read a better comeuppance in my life."
3,Not one of her best.,"Keys to the Street is not one of Rendell's better books, and she has so many better books. Diehard fans will like this well enough, but the endless descriptions of London neighborhoods are very dull, and the book takes a long time to get off the ground. Also, there are occasional shortcuts taken, which is something this author seldom does. Her characters are usually very well done, although again, this one didn't blow me away. New readers should start with The Rottweiler, or any of the Barbara Vine books."
3,An OK Read,"Keys To The Street seemed more like a Barbara Vine book than a Ruth Rendell: less emphasis on the crime and its solution and more attention to nuances of character and setting. The heroine's passivity was a hump to get over, and the ending wasn't very imaginative. Nevertheless, Rendell writes clear sentences and in this day and age that's an accomplishment. The main plot device, a bone marrow donor trying to extricate herself from an abusive relationship and becoming involved with the recipient was intriguing."
2,Read something else,"This plot was unbelievable, the ending even worse. This was the first Ruth Rendell I've read and I'm told by my book club counterparts that she's an excellent author. If that's really the case I would recommend starting with some other books of hers because this one was lame."
4,Great book ruined by a pat ending,"I thought this was one of Rendell's best books until the ending which was completely pat, absolutely no surprise. The characterizations were the best I've ever read in a Rendell novel. I agree with another reviewer that this novel is more 'Barbara Vine' than Ruth Rendell, but since I read both, I wasn't put off by this."
2,Neither a drama nor a thriller,"This book was a disappointment to me - the author apparently couldn't decide whether to write a drama or a thriller, so she combined the two and didn't do justice to either. pity - I've really enjoyed some of her other books."
5,"Once you start reading this book, you can NEVER put it down!","This book is really good and interesting. if you read one chapter, you have to read the next or else it leaves you hanging on the hook! people who love humor and romance should really read this book!"
4,gracefully and masterfully,"I saw the trio perform on the North Sea Jazz Festival 2005. Guiliana plays like he wants to ru'n his kit. Barsh has enough attitude in his eyes -cocky like hell- to pass it into his music and Cohen is the masterbrain. I knew this from ""At Home"", but was still surpised by their fire on stage. They rock!!!On ""At Home"" the trio is joined by an ensemble. This gives more depth to the sound. I am not a fan of the flute playing Anne Drummond, though on track 6 the compared sound of flute and flugelhorn sounds terrific. Track 3 involves singing which I believe to be a big mistake of the composing Cohen, but the music has a nice ethnic quality wich gives Cohen his identity.Track 4 gives me the oppertunity to mention that great piano trio E.S.T. In Remembering the Cohentrio plays not unlike E.S.T., but otherwise this trio (& ensemble)is not to be compared. I find the sound new an never dull.FJB/O!-music 2005"
4,Nice house,"Great disc of adventurous Jazz with just the right mixture of intelligence and heart should appease and appeal to both liberals and relative conservatives of the genre, hopefully helping gap-filling and bridge-building collections blossom."
3,Cooldown,"If you enjoy trip-hop flavors, or just the sound of a beautiful voice to occupy your mind during all of life's trivial pursuits, then grab this album or listen to it first( as with anything),though I'm sure you'' dig it! Great vocals and well produced."
3,Nice looks but gets thinner,These wheels are just the same as the regular wheels so the wheels will get thin very easily if you run it outside alot.
1,Definately Garbage,"I have the original vinyl copy of this. If you like vocals you can't even start to understand and like poor death metal, than this is for you."
5,One of Snyder's very best books,"I have read this story many, many times since I was 11, and I am 33. I am very surprised that of all Snyder's books, this one is not in print. It is a magical story and much of it reminded me of my own experiences."
5,I found it!,"I read this book years ago. It has haunted me ever since then, yet I had long ago forgotten the name and the author, as well as the main plot. All I rembered was a few pieces here and there as well as the sense of emptiness after I realized I had finished the book. I'm so happy to have found this book again. That is my main goal for today, to find all of the books that have haunted me. I'm doing pretty good so far!"
5,The Changeling was WONDERFUL!,"I think The Changeling was a very imaginative book,with many obstacles to make you want to keep reading. I wish this book had never ended and that I could still be reading it for the first time now. I wish I could have a friend like Ivy, who is never scared and has a different way of crying!"
2,The State Within,"I chose this title based on the on line reviews. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the story did not live up to the hype. Every scene was melodramatic which spoiled the characterization and distorted the plot. There was no build up of tension. Instead of it being a cerebral thriller, ""State"" presented itself as a high-pitched melodrama. Not my taste."
2,Preachy BBC series,"Is this an espionage mini-series or a polemical documentary about all that is wrong with the U.S., from British eyes ? I quickly became bored with this series as it went from one scene depicting U.S. ""human rights abuses"" (including the death penalty), to the next. Preachy and ideological in content, somber and depressing in tone and even in color (was this thing shot during winter in Britain, or does the sun ever shine in D.C. ? ). Very typical BBC production in which the bad guys are neo-cons and the U.S. ""far right""."
4,Who blinked?,"Just finished the last episode. I am so sorry it's over. I like ""24"" but here the writing is terrific, the action is slam bang and I loved the casting, really interesting looking people like Matt the Reporter and George the Cop, and everyone else for that matter. And though the body count is high, it usually happens fast and without Jack--oh I'm sorry, of course I mean Mark (or Nicholas) torturing anyone. Just a great, great little miniseries. So. Who blinked?"
5,Very interesting mini series,"Very interesting BBC Miniseries. A little confusing,because of a large cast. Kinda hard to keep track of who's who. I enjoyed it a lot tho."
1,The BBC ain't what it used to be,"A mere 30 minutes into the first episode and these utopian leftists had already piled on every simplistic negative stereotype of Americans in existence. A plane is blown up and the ""hicks"" in Virginia round up all the muslims? That's funny, I seem to remember a little plane incident on 9/11/01 and no such round-up took place. And of course the black Brit war hero on death row is innocent--aren't they all?!? LOL, what naive drivel. The only thing entertaining about this schlock is how sophisticated its creators imagine themselves to be. Bollocks!"
2,stale 'n thin,"One star for finally making Virginia into a British colony. One star for decent cinematography and pace. Minus 2001 points for boring moonbat paranoia.Aside from the brave phlegmatic British Ambassador hero (and his soon to be mistress) all the characters are totally one dimensional stereotypes. Soul-less fat American politicians and business people, pretty dark-skinned people trapped by racism, flamboyant British gay traitor. And who knew that the BBC suffered from a writer's strike in 2006?"
1,Sound and fury signifying nothing,"Really a waste of time. Full of pumped up editing and music, but, ultimately highly predictable, right from the plane crash. There are far to many layers of plot, and needless complications. And the ending is an absolute cop out!"
5,Brilliant and suspenseful series - not to be missed,"Take the adrenalin from 24 and put it in the world of diplomacy and world politics - you get The State Within. Energy and drive throughout the whole series, and with shocking opening."
1,"Utterly Predictable ""Complex Political Thriller""","After watching the first half hour of this barker I knew how it was going to play out. This film packs in every Brit/lefty-paranoia-conspiracy-anti-American trope you can think of.Staggeringly ignorant, think of it as a less nuanced version of ""V for Vendetta""."
2,I'm disappointed...,"I lovelovelove dark chocolate, (and other strong, pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer) but these taste just plain wierd. It's not terrible, but I can taste the hoodia, sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate. I think they work at reducing hunger, but they give me gas so bad I can't be sure if I want to eat less because of the hoodia, or the gas. Maybe I'll try the *regular* ChocoLeans, but I won't be buying this again.FYI: I absolutely LOVE the Phytobase powdered chocolate hoodia shake mix. I have no problems with that. Tastes great, works great. And no gas!!"
4,Not as Good as Season 1 & 2,"I'm a huge fan of The Lost World and have watched all the episodes many times. Season three went down hill after first losing Malone, then Veronica (due to some contract issues with the Austrailian Gov., not the actors themselves). The writers tried to keep the story going by having Malone appear in a cameo appearance as a ghost and Veronica coming back in the final few eppisodes. They tried to replace Veronica with a new character from the future named Finn, but it just wasn't the same show. I do hope if the show comes back the get Malone and Veronica back on the show. Other than that, I think this is one of the best TV series Ive ever seen."
5,end of a great series,"There must of been problems in the cast,because I was thrown off by separation of caracters in last season but dinosaur cgi was far better than first season.though still lacking in believeability.the plot was more believableas well."
5,Loving The Lost World,"This fantastic series is a combination of action,adventure &romance; with an incredibly talented cast and crew. It has breathtakingly beautiful scenery shot on location on Australia's Gold Coast and has something for everyone of all ages. It is a great show to watch with the entire family. I highly recommend it, not only for the superb acting and talented writing, butbecause this show is just plain fun to watch. The characters draw you in to the story and leave you wanting more."
5,Happy viewer in Minnesota,"Fans of the TLW have been waiting a long time for this DVD to arrive! Even while the series is currently in delayed mode as to the date of this review, the fan base continues to grow stongly. Creative plots bring strong characters to life in this turn of the century sci-fi action/drama. Very reasonable price for this season one DVD set!"
2,...to be continued... yeah right!@?,"I have awarded 5 stars to the previous seasons, and heartbrokenly decided for only 2 on this one as it is greatly disappointing to realize that there is no ending to this story. It has been a most amazing journey as I ventured into Season 1, Season 2 and Season 3 of The Lost World, and it is so sad that fans like me do not get the joy of living the final chapter.What about 1 more episode???How about a book???Please....?"
2,"poor quality with some of the C D""s",Some of our C D discs were of poor quality. They stuttered and we could not view all we bought.
2,The Lost World,I was very disappointed with this DVD set. I had to return it twice cause of defectiveness. It was a gift gone bad :(
1,Boring,"This show was great while it was on(it's been cancelled), It has great characters and good storylines but since they started showing the reruns over and over again it's kinda gotten old. I don't feel it's worth the money to buy."
5,you will love the lost world,"If you are into action and adventure than this is the show for you! I love to watch the Lost World! The show has everything from action to romance! The actors are wonderful, and they portray their charactures very well! The dvd is totally worth it!"
3,Learning,"I have still much to learn but this small book has helped in my understanding of the Eternal Covenant. However, I must admit it was hard for me to follow the first half of the book. But this is probably since I was trying to absorb so much new teaching. For those that are not well read take your time and go slow. Those of a more theological or philosophical background may enjoy the book even more than I. This will probably be a re-read for me later in the year."
2,Not a great book.,"I would not recommend this book. It was really not helpful for us. We currently have a yahoo store with over 6000+ items and this book is really geared for stores with 50 or less items. The attached software was not useful. However, I would recommend another book: ""Starting a Yahoo! Business For Dummies"", by Richard Snell. The Snell book is much more useful and full of informative advance stuff for starting and improving your Yahoo store. David Mark, Cmdstore"
1,Out of date and totally useless,This product refers to a software tool once available on a Yahoo site. That has been replaced with something with the same title but very different. This book could be of no use to no one. No one should buy this book.
3,Okay!!!!!,The dvd was okay but I was expecting to see more performances on the dvd. The performances that were showed on the commercial didn't make it to the dvd.
5,"Slightly rhythmic, yet pleasantly relaxing.","I love this cd so much I have one at the office, and one at home, and my husband bought another for the car. This isn't exactly music that I can go sleep to, but it is soothing and relaxing. It's the most moving music I have ever heard, and stirs my very soul! It puts me back in time to I don't know where, but I like where it puts me. I'm going to get all of Medhi's albums, I hope they are as great as this one!"
3,Overrated,"This is not a bad CD. In fact, I'll admit I haven't heard any other work by Mehdi. But I find it uninspired. A friend who listened in when I received it asked why I'd ordered elevator music.I would wholeheartedly recommed that listeners check out music by Vangelis as an alternative. In particular, the album titled Antartica - it's one of the best album's I've got in my collection. If any CD I own ever wears out from overuse, it'll be that one.Back to Mehdi - not a bad effort, but lacking in any punch or originality. Nothing distinctive souding as Yanni, not as soulful as Kitaro."
5,READ THE REVIEWS !!!,After lot's of money spent on bogus instrumental CDs that only offer 2 or 3 good tracks. I can't begin to tell you how much this artists music has enriched our lives... At first I thought... [money amount] but it's worth every penny. My husband and I are Mehdi fans for life. Just read the reviews and believe me when I tell you that they are all true...
1,This is music for relaxing???,"In my search for music to soothe my savage breast, I happened upon and purchased, without listening to examples first, Instumental Escape Vol.5. This is not relaxing music. It's dance music at best and at worst, it's banal pop music. The only escape here was for the CD, which shall find its way to the resale shop. I can at least get back a small amount of what I wasted on buying it."
2,Not the greatest.,Suction cups do not stick and it does not fit my helmet very good. I definately would not recommend this item.
1,very misleading,I purchased this for my grandson - he had it on his wish list. Even after reading the description of the item it doesn't say it was just an attachment to a helmet. I think the company had better re-write the production description. My grandson has no use for this without a helmet. I hope other customers read this review before buying anything from this website.Mis-lead customer.
4,one of the best rock band in puerto rico,is not the best album from this band but is a clasic album the best song psychodelic psycomenta. the song that make me buy this cd is the metal version of calle luna calle sol I love it specially the bass jey you rock.
1,Didn't work for me.,"I tried to install the driver on my computer.The computer went into a loop, just booting, shutting down, and rebooting. I was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point.I'm scared to try it again.Any body want it? I'll sell it cheap. For that matter, just pay the postage and it's yours."
3,messy to appy but protects the viewing screen adequately,"tricky to apply due to necessary stickiness, but has provided peace of mind when i use and store my Canon PowerShot SD450. took some time to align and left very small sticky spots underneath the protector, though these become invisible when the viewer is activated. pricey for what is essentially a thick piece of plastic, but works."
5,HAIRSPRAY SOUNDTRACK,"The music on this is excellent. See the movie, learn the songs and sing your heart out. The lead singer is awesome, Zac Efron is adorable and John Travolta rocks!"
2,WEAK!,This is weak compared to the original broadway sdtk! I'm a huge Hairspray fan...There is a definate lack of energy on the movie sdtk...I hope the movie doesn't turn the same fate.
4,Really fun,This is good music with good singing. Not necessarily great singing. These songs are catchy and if you liked the movie you will enjoy having the music to sing all too!
5,AMAZING!!!,This soundtrack is excellent. EVERY song is so catchy and wonderful. My girls who are 6 & 7 yrs old listen to it over and over again!
5,Hairspray,"I was dancing in my seat watching the movie,Now i'm dancing all over the place listening to the cd."
4,Alright,This product arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. Wasn't really impressed with the music on there. But it seems to have all the songs on the movie. Just wished there wasn't a repeat of the same song in there.
2,"Good, but disappointing.","I rated this item a 2 for one simple reason: these singers can't even compare to the original broadway cast. Trust me if you really want to be awed by this fantastic musical, buy the broadway version."
4,Great Soundtrack Even With a Few Changes,"If you were expecting an exact replica of the Broadway soundtrack, you'll be disappointed. The movie version adds a couple of new songs: one was actually supposed to included in the Broadway version, but I think it was pulled out because of time constraint. Anyway, kudos to the movie cast for making this a great listen."
3,Missing Harvey!,"When will they learn that when they bring a broadway show to film, they need to cast the people that made it a SMASH?If the recording is an indication of how good the film will be, I am afraid that I will be disappointed by John Travolta. I see he has top billing, yet he is hardly heard on the recording. The numbers that he appears in are not done well at all. He did not bring anything to the table with this recording. I was longing for Harvey Fierstein in ""Timeless to Me"".The rest of the recording is good and the new songs are just fine. Queen Latifah does a wonderful job and I am anxious to see her performance. The new Tracy sounds adorable and I am sure she will be a hit.I am still looking forward to the film, but I would easily pick the broadway recording to listen to any day."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Having just purchasesd and listened to the Hairspray soundtrack, I was very disappointed about how flat it all sounds? While the broadway show and the movie should be judged as two separate entities (due to casting), I enjoyed the broadway soundtrack because there was a sense of joy, enthusiasm and fun in the voices of the cast. This cast, however, only seems to be ""singing"" the songs, but the feeling just isnt there. While everyone is praising Queen Latifah, I found her renditions just lacking any emotion. Dont get me started on John Travolta...and Amanda Bynes? Michelle Pfeifers version is just too droll....but Zac Efron does a very good job of bringing his songs to life. If this is any indication of the movie, I might be avoiding it."
4,Great addition to the movies,"I purchased this after I saw the movie. It's great to have a recording of all the songs from the movie (plus some extras). While some of the songs are definitely better than others, this is one soundtrack that I can listen to the whole way through. Inclusion of the lyrics is always a bonus. I also enjoyed the exclusive website you can visit."
5,You Won't Get It Out of Your Head...,"The move was fantastic, and the soundtrack mirrors this... The vast majority of the songs are upbeat and unbelievably catchy. I've seen many musicals in my day, and I must say that this is the first one that actually made me feel better about myself after taking a look and listen. From the immediate attention grabbing ""Good Morning Baltimore"" to the undeniably infectious ""You Can't Stop the Beat,"" the soundtrack keeps the energy high and the toes a tappin'. See the movie, and then... well, you'll buy the soundtrack =)"
5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!","This is an EXTREMELY fun soundtrack! We just saw the movie tonight, and I was toe-tapping the whole time! I just about got out of my seat and danced in the aisles! I have never been so rocked by a soundtrack before! It was FUN. That is the best word to describe EVERYTHING in this movie. The music, the movie, the acting, everything! I think I'll wear this cd out playing it. :o)"
5,Great CD,My daughter loves the movie! Its only right to get her the cd for her ipod :) Its a great addition to the collection.
4,Colorful Music,I enjoyed watching the film so much that I had to buy the soundtrack. You can hear the happiness in the main actress' voice when she sings. It makes you feel happy too.
4,Too bad didn't include all the songs,"Too bad they didn't include both versions of ""The New Girl in Town"" - just the Britanny Snow version. Oh well - maybe the next release...."
5,Hairspray Soundtrack,"Wonderful soundtrack! I'm able to visualize the scenes from the movie with each track. If you loved the movie, you MUST get this CD!"
5,Fabulous music,I absolutely love my soundtrack of Hairspray. I laugh and sing along as I drive to work. It makes my day start off on a happy note.
5,Hairspray CD,"GREAT CD! Great movie too. The tracks are great, especially if you enjoyed the singing in the movie. Nikki Blonsky has an outstanding voice. Zac Efron has a great voice too....and he has a few solo tracks on this soundtrack. But, the best singing was Queen Latifah! She has an AMAZING voice! I truly recommend buying this CD....and go see the movie!"
3,HAIRSPRAY SOUNDTRACK TO MOTION PICTURE,IT IS GREAT. MAKES YOU WANT TO DANCE. DESTINED TO BE A WINNER!
3,Fun With One Exception,"I am probably going to be crucified for saying this, but I thought the film was terrific with one glaring exception..John Travolta. While I think he is immensely talented...here he just seems immense! I found him difficult to watch, his fake voice annoying...his fat costume too disconcerting. Why didn't they have Harvey Fierstein recreate his Tony winning role?The rest of the cast are delightful! Nicky Blonski is wonderful, as are Michele Pfeiffer (Always!), Queen Latifah (Always!), Christopher Walken, etc... Lot's of marvelous colorful fun!!"
4,beautiful cuts!,This saw produced perfect cuts. It's easy and comfortable to handle and so much better than the back saws that come in typical miter kits.
5,SKS instruction manual,"The basic SKS insutruction manual is great for a novice or new owner. It is easy to read and provides the basic knowledge or understanding one needs to properly maintain the SKS rifle. It is not a gunsmiths manual, however it is very susinct and informative."
3,cute little book,"I have a book of take downs, this little book is a nice supplement . i would not rely on it for a real shoter manual.the pics are not detailed enough for that.for instance you cant tell if the recoil spring as a front or back or is it important.I am not sure by reading this.sSKS Rifle Disassembly & Reassembly Gun-guide (Disassembly & Reassembly Guide)"
4,Griz,A good field expedient reference. Not meant for in depth review of this firearm. Shows weapon break down for dis-assembly/reassembly and parts nomenclature.
5,A wonderful documentary of Celia's career and life,"I enjoyed the personal interviews with Pedro Knight, Johnny Pacheco, Omer Padilla, her sister, Gladys. The pre-Castro footage of Cuba was interesting as well. There was good footage of her early days with Sonora Matancera, great clips of performances with Tito Puente, Johnny Pacheco and the Fania Allstars, Ray Baretto etc. Well worth the price. It is in Spanish as is only right as Celia was most comfortable in her native language. It made me happy for the full 145 minutes. I sure do miss, La Reina, tho. Siempre vivire, Celia en su musica."
4,A few scratches but great subject!,"I love Celia's music and wanted to share her life story with my Spanish students. In spite of a few skips from the scratches on this used DVD, my classes enjoyed it and learned a lot about the life and work of this great Cuban artist."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"When it comes to tribute albums it's either hit or miss.This one alone doesn't even show up on the radar.I got this in anticipation that it would be intense. A symphony doing a tribute to one of my all time favorite bands. I was way too quick to judge it a stellar performance before I even brought it up to the cash register.Got it to the car and popped it into my cd player and drove off to go home.The first track sounded okay and symphonic, but everything else after just sounded all synthesized and cheeeeeeeeeeezy.It doesn't even deserve the star I gave it.It reminded me of some sort of crappy Wyndam Hill compilation from the 80's or something.Maybe if your a John Tesh fan or Yanni you might like this but this was absolutely disappointing and an utter waste of 13.99."
1,One word to describe it...,Elevator? You know you are getting old when your favorite songs have become elevator music!!!I feel the wrinkles coming on!!My advise...download..then listen to see if you really want to waste the $$.
1,Symphonic?,"DM really deserve a symphonic tribute, but this one is so far from it, as only one can imagine. Even if traditional classical instruments are used (which I strongly doubt), it all sounds like driven through a cheap midi eqiupment. Does someone really have a say what someone else does with his songs? There must be a way!!!!!Anyway, stay away from this CD, whether you are a fan or not. (...)"
1,Boooooooooooooooooring,I love Depeche Mode and have liked certain instrumental tributes to other bands. I thought this would be a nice addition to my collection. I was so so so wrong. The songs are a little too unrecognizable and otherwise poorly interpreted. It is incredibly dull (songs drag on forever and have been slowed down to sleepy speed).
1,Why even bother,"I'm suprised this once great band released this knowing that their backbone was gone. Martin Walkyier was Sabbat and was Skyclad, Sabbat failed with this release just like Skyclad failed when he left. Anything Martin will do from now on musically and especially lyrically will blow both bands now without him out of the water."
4,CARLO BERGONZI & LUCIA,"I agree with all of the above coments, and have nothing more to add about the glorious singing. Carlo Bergonzi has one of the most beautiful tenor voices of his or any other era. I, personally, was very disapointed in the quality of the picture. I know that that performance was recorded in Japan in the late 60's so I was expecting a clearer picture on my new HD TV. It is fantastic to see & hear a youngish Bergonzi & Scotto. The sound & singing are fantastic and this DVD is worth having for any fan of Carlo Bergonzi."
1,Stopped working in less than one month. Very disappointed.,"I was extremely happy with this product for the first 3 weeks or so. Although there is some minor background noise making it no substitute for a cable at home, it was very acceptable for automobile use.I did notice immediately after receiving the product how shoddy the manufacturing appeared to be. The device itself is very flimsy and is certainly not what one expects from the shimmering metallic photographs on the websites.After less than a month of regular use, it stopped working properly. The digital display now fluctuates, and it does not transmit a signal properly.It does appear that other manufacturers such as Belkin and Sony offer similar products. I would recommend purchasing such devices from these more reputable companies.If you're still not convinced, check the reviews for the older models (the 300w for example) and there you will find similar complaints."
1,"Faulty product, manufacturer shameless","I sent this unit back after it failed to broadcast. Irock Customer service department did not answer phone calls, did not answer voicemails. After I returned it to them, via email tney claimed the unit was fine. They sent it back to me and after 2 days of use it stopped working, just like the first time. Perhaps this unit is okay for other users, but it is clear that if you end up with a faulty unit, like me, there will be no responsible customer service backing this product and you will be stuck with a non-functioning purchase. I would not trust this manufacturer since for me the product was flawed & manufacturer did not stand behind their product with adequate customer service."
1,reliability of Irock's 450FM,"I own an old Irock product Beamit 400W for little over a year now. Even though the battery operation no longer works, the mini plug had to be replaced and finally the on-off swith sticks, the four transmitting channels still work. I recently noted that Irock introduced the 450FM model capable of transmitting within the full spectrum of the FM band. I bought one right away. It worked nicely but, alas, for only one day! After I changed over between the battery mode and the in-car power supply mode a couple of times, the device ceased transmitting and the display showed only 3 unreadable digits (should be 4 plus a decimal point)! My conclusion is that Irock did introduce a much more useful and attractively designed device but has neglected to pack into it a good reliability!!"
4,Works Great for Me,"I use the IRock connected to an MP3 device for listening to audio books. Since I'm not listening to music, the quality is great for what I need. It's a great device for when I'm in the pool. I connect it all up and then put on radio headphones while I'm sitting in the lounger. It's also great for when I'm doing housework or cooking. I just use a radio in the kitchen and I don't have to have headphones at all."
1,Disappointed in every way,"The iRock works fine for its price. The reception is very good most of the time. Some times when you need to turn off the enhancements (if any) that your MP3 Player might have to make MP3s sound better (like bass levels, equalizer, etc) to get a good reception. I friend of mine has had one for months.But after two days of using mine the SCREEN STOP WORKING, the unit was transmitting fine, but the screen was dead.CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST EVER!!! I send my unit back to them and after TWO MONTHS and 6 emails I still haven't heard from them.I don't know what to do, I feel like I just wasted my money (when I bought it was $39.99).Bottom Line:+ it's small+ it's cheap+ works well- could stop working after just a few days- HORRIBLE costumer serviceTake your chances, but before you do, keep in mind that getting a replacement or your money back could be impossible (I'm still waiting for mine...)"
3,Cheap but not very good,"I live in a mid-size city with a fair amount of radio coverage, which made it nice to have a transmitter without preset radio frequencies, however I have recently tried to buy a very cheap car audio system with a audio input and for twice the price (still not too bad), I have an excellent Sony system with perfect playback and audio quality.Among transmitters that I have seen this was the best, however it does not quite compare to complete set-ups."
3,I Rock Rocks?,"Purchasing an IRock on Amazon was easy. Receiving it was easy, but trying to find a station that was compatible between it and my ipod was not. The quality of the music I heard was not good, however a friend of mine plugged it into her ipod and it worked great. I have since sold this product to her."
1,piece of junk,"Right out of the package, it was broken. The LCD display didn't work at all, so there was no way to know where it was set, and thus impossible to use. It might actually work if it weren't broken, I can't know that, all I can tell you is that the one I received was junk."
1,No good AVOID,"Mine stopped working after 2 days, although the screen is fine, it just doesn't transmit anymore on any station.The worst part is I can't get any reply from the manufacturer to return it to them. One of thier e-mails returned a 'mailbox full' message. Frustrating. Since so many other people have had problems with this product and its customer service I would highly suggest avoid buying anything from this manufacturer."
2,No durability,"Having an FM transmitter is great. Having an FM transmitter that works longer than 7 months must be great. I wouldn't know, this one just stopped working, and I am on the market for a new one.Lasts no more than a few hours on batteries.Great while it lasted."
4,This album Rocks,"Joint ventures, who? Thats what I thought when I got it. But I loved it as soon as I heard the first song. Itz da joint is one of the best songs ever! Its not a serious album but one for people who enjoy a bit of fun in their hip-hop!"
5,Tympani Brilliance,"There is certainly no accounting for taste. Unlike the preceeding reviewer, the piece on this recording that really impressed me is ""Eight Pieces For Four Tympani."" All the other pieces are quite good as well, but the tympani piece is superb. Daniel Druckman is indeed a tympani vituoso. However, the typani piece is not simply virtuosity for the sake of virtuosity. There is genuine creativity and musical entertainment going on here, both in composition and interpretation. It's fun, fascinating and completely satisfying from beginning to end. Is the tympani piece worth the price of admission? I absolutely think so. Five stars for the tympani piece and 4 1/2 for the others."
2,Not worth watching,"I bought this based on the previous reviews and I was very disappointed. Not enough action, not enough of anything. I sat through all 26 episodes hoping to see if the hero gets any better or if there was going to be a big final battle, was disappointed by the whole thing."
4,"Reprint only, Funny series anyway","A humorous dungeon crawl anime series.According to info I've found on Anime News Network, this is not a continuation of the 2005 release from ADV, but a reprinting...so ""Volume 2"" is misleading.Still, if you don't have Rune Soldier Louie already, this is a great anime series in a similar tone to Slayers"
1,I've been mislead,"This product is not a second series of the original release, it is a new version on the box and dvd art. I will be seeking a refund."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"I saw this one about a year ago, and it now collects dust on my shelf.I won't say there is nothing good about it. The art isn't too bad, the theme song is cute, and there are a lot of humorous moments. I wish I had watched a few episodes before I actually bought it, though.I know that this is true of many animes, but in Rune Soldier it seems especially true that the characters are recycled. I didn't find any of them that interesting, except for Louie's best friend Illa--she slays me. A lot of the jokes either don't come off that well or are just used to death.I'd recommend that you watch a little before you buy it. Who knows? You might enjoy it--although probably not enough to buy it."
3,"A fun run, but lacking in true plot","The adventures of Louie and a band of three women (a priest/healer type, Melissa, who is War God-sworn to serve her Hero, and the rogue, Merrill, and a fighter, Genie, who are her friends). Louie is assigned by his foster father to become a mage, but Louie's desires lay with the sword, so the studies (and his female mage friend, who has a crush on him) are neglected as he plays inadequate swordsman with the girls following behind in his mess. As Anime News Network describes the show, ""Watching Rune Soldier is like watching a group of stalwart Dungeons & Dragons campaigners playing with a solitary wiseass that refuses to take the game seriously."" The show is fun, but the plots are sketchy, at best, with no real satisfaction at the end (who IS Louie's real father, really? what is so special about him??? etc). A casual watch."
2,Didn't Like it,"Maybe it was just not the type of Anime I was looking for. Went off a friend who said they liked it, but turns out, not my style."
3,Did not meet expectations,"From some of the reviews I expected the development of a subplot throughout the series. The art quality was good but not spectacular, certainly not immovative. The writers did n=manage to give the central characters a promising thre-dimensionality, but then made little or no effort to take it any further. The final story arc was late in appearing, rushed in charcter and disappointig in its simplicity.All in all, I didn't feel cheated by buying the boxed set used and being able to watch the set straight through, but overall I didn't get attached enough to the story arc to keep it, especailly since it ended with a huge number of olot holes that we'll never see resolved.Brian McCrary"
3,Full of laughs,"Another clueless hero...sexy fan-girls (but, not a fan service show)... some good laughs... and fun work to add to the anime collection...Doesn't have the depth of feeling that other superior anime has but still enjoyable... especially for the $$.Take it home have a few cocktails... laugh... write a review... hehe... it is pretty good stuff but you can shut your brain off for most of it."
4,Louie is the Bomb,Once again something borrowed from my sister. This is a fun and loose cartoon that has fun with a lot of fantasy archetypes. Louie is down right entertaining. A definite plus for the anime genre. I still love Those Who Hunt Elves better though. =)
5,Louie for the win.,"This series was def worth what I spent on it. Because I didn't want to spend almost 60-70 bucks for a new boxset, I bought it used. The product was pretty much like I had bought it brand new. Only spent about 26$ on it too. ^.^VERY, very funny. Louie will have you literally laughing out loud. And that starts right from the first episode too!The storyline is pretty good paced, it's not super fast, and it's not super slow either. The artwork is brightly colored and the characters are easily lovable even right from the start. I think everyone's favorite character is probably Louie, after all he is the main star of the show(The manga is originally called ""Louie the Rune Solider, that was as good as the anime.)I won't give out any spoilers for the story, other reviewers can do that for you but if you're an anime collector like myself this is def a must. :)"
3,poor packaging,"Loved the thermometer itself, purchased it for a gift, however there was nothing protecting the face of the thermometer and it came with a crack and lots of scratches. I am returning it and hope to reorder it again with better luck in protection of the face. Refuse to give a gift that is all scratched up and has a crack, looked used."
3,Average Tai Chi dvd,The dvd's o.k. The price of 47 cents cant be beat. But $6.95 shipping is definately high.
3,Complexity of Connection,More academic than I anticipated! So I've procrastinated really getting through it. C.
4,A talent waiting to be exploited,A film of broken and fragmented relationships held together by deep and indestuctable bonds of family. Moving performances especially by David Ajala and Matt di Angelo. Ajala already has many stage and film credits to his name. Let's hope that Matt di Angelo is given ample opportunities before long to prove himself futher. His is a talent waiting to be exploited.
5,Excellent!,"I got two pair of these suspenders for my brother-in-law. I had them sent to my address as I wanted to check them out first. To me the suspenders looked exactly as advertised and looked very sturdy and comfortable. I received them in a few days, in time for me to deliver them much earlier then expected. My brother-in-law (and sister) are very well satisfied with them. No complaints out of my brother-in-law, and that is quite an endorsement -- since he is difficult to please."
5,GREAT DVD!,This is one of my favorites! Can be used at home or in a group setting...great for worship servies! Use this ALOT!
4,Love the DVD but some songs are messed up,"I love, love, love, this dvd. The reason it didn't get 5 stars is because there are several videos that skip or stall. I thought maybe it was just my one dvd but I bought more and the same problem is there."
5,Easy to use,"These jacks are simple to use - no need to strip the wires, just insert the wires into the channels and press the top part down into place. The two pieces make a good bond and then it easily snaps into a Keystone wall plate. The phone cord makes for a good, snug connection."
3,Hawkwind - 'Palace Springs' (Roadracer Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Another decent live Hawkwind effort that was recorded on the band's U.S. tour in 1990. Line-up is as follows: Brock, Bainbridge, Alan Davey, Richard Chadwick, Simon House and vocalist Bridgett Wishart. This CD has got to feature the QUIETEST live audience I've ever encountered. I've spoken with two fans that actually attended a few dates of the band's 1990 tour and both confirmed it was, indeed a quiet crowd. The disc's track listing is somewhat impressive with older tunes such as ""Lives Of Great Men"" (actually ""Golden Void""), ""Time We Left"" and ""Damnation Alley"". Then there's a couple of songs that are exclusive to this CD, like ""Acid Test"" and the mind blowing ""Treadmill"". Great sound mix."
3,Scratchy,"I don't like it much because it is too big and it is very scratchy to my scalp. Oh well, I think I got one too large."
3,"I love Burl Ives, but...","This is simply not a good selection of Ives' songs. Several of the versions are grossly inferior earlier cuts with poor sound quality. I refer particularly to the incomparably lovely ""Lavender Blue"" and ""Goober Peas."" The versions included here were recorded in the late 1940's and later versions by Burl are infinitely superior. The only stellar cuts are ""A Little Bitty Tear"" and ""Maryann Regrets."" The rest of the songs were not big hits and are poor filler material.Burl Ives was an American treasure and his best work has aged well and is still wonderful music. However, you won't find it on this weak compilation."
3,Long laster,"Wow, this bar of soap really holds up for a long time. Nice packaging and nice look (before ~40 or so uses you can still read the imprint). The sent was purfumy rather than musky.. I would have prefered a friendlier, heavier musk, but that's a matter of opinion. I have dry skin and will be buying something with 'moisturizers' in it next time because this bar is like...You know how a long time ago when you went skiing on real wood skis and you had to rub wax on the bottoms so they would grip the snow? This bar of soap is to a brick of wax and my body is to the wood skis...I'm not sure if this is an everybody thing or if it's just me (I do have dry skin mind you), but I did not like applying this soap nor did I enjoy the remainder of the shower having it on me."
4,Laugh out loud!,"Even though the blurb on the back made me hesitate to watch this film, I had heard it was funny. So with little expectations, I was surprised at how often I laughed out loud while watching it. Luke Wilson plays a nice guy with bad luck in love who is egged on by his not-so-well meaning friend, played by Vince Vaughn, to turn his house on campus into a fraternity house. Will Ferrell is of course the main source of slap stick humor, but he does it so well.It is a step above the usual dumb-is-funny comedies and worth a watch."
4,Great Book,I have gone to many of the places this book recommends and all of them have been as discussed in the book. If you are new to Colorado I would highly recommend this book.
5,IT HAS NICE MUSIC,"THESE GUYS HAVE PRETTY GOOD MUSIC, GOOD SONGS, AND IT LOOKS LIKIE THE'RE YOUNG SO THEY HAVE A FUTURE"
1,Keys don't work in all apps,"I bought this for my 2d grader. I've had nothing but complaints because all keys don't work in all games. They all work when typing, though. I'm buying another keyboard now."
3,"Kids love it, but hard to use","I got this for my 6 & 3 year olds. They love it, but it is very hard for my husband and I to use. The number keys are off slightly, which is very frustrating. To me, I think that having the keys in the wrong spot (even slightly) would make learning to type harder."
3,It's still propaganda,"A Satanist myself, it still seems a little cheezy. Much like Secret Life Of A Satanist, it appears to be written by LaVey himself, but we're told it isn't. With many journalists investigating the life of Anton Szandor LaVey and figuring out the truth behind the myths, a book like this, full of these myths, is kind of embarassing. Just so you know, you don't have to like or believe this book to be a Satanist. A philosophy can be accepted without agreeing with the personality of the philosopher, and without believing the philosopher when he brags about himself. This is not a cult of personality, even if this book seems to make it sound that way."
4,Church of Satan Review,"I finished reading the book not too long ago. If your looking imformation of the Church of Satan and who the organization is ran, then this book is for you. If your looking for a book than gives extensive knowledge on Anton LaVey's life, then I reccommend Secert Life of a Satanist by Blanche Barton. The chapter I enjoyed most from the Church of Satan is the chapter the on Satanic Magic. Barton shares more about it than LaVey did in the Satanic Bible. In the chapter it talks about how Satanist's can use any of the rituals in the Satanic Rituals as a creative springboard for there own creative rituals.I'd say anyone coming to Satanism for the first time still have the Satanic Bible, but if they want more insight and hear LaVey expand in areas he didn't in the Satanic Bible, then Barton's Church of Satan is worth buying."
4,Worth every penny...,"I've waited years to finally get my hand on a copy of this book and am glad I finally have a copy in my possession. While the Church of Satan website has listed that a new, revised edition is in the works and due out sometime soon, you won't be sad if you decide to ultimately drop close to a c-note on the book right now. It's a potpourri of Satanic goodness. I like to see this as a benchmark for the serious Satanist to ultimately own in ones collection."
2,Zoe Trilling is the star!,"This movie is incredibly boring. Not as boring as ""The Firm"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" but almost as boring as said movies! The only reason, and I put the emphasis on ONLY, reason that I give this more than one star is because there is ONE redeeming factor. That one redeeming factor is Zoe Trilling, who was one of the prettiest girls (both body and face) of the late 80's and the 1990's. She was also very underrated. She only has two scenes and her first scene is the ONLY good thing about this movie. She plays a lesbian, and the main character catches her in his shower and her big tits show, frontal nudity to the camera, for about 1 and a half seconds before she quickly covers up. Although she plays a lesbian, there is no lesbian boob grab and no lesbian kissing.The rest of the movie, is so bad that I can't even tell what is ""supposed"" to be funny.If you're not a fan of Zoe Trilling, or don't embrace of the beauty of women, don't rent this movie at all."
2,It hurt to watch,This tour coincides with his vocal scare and this concert is an indication of it. He holds back greatly on his performance yet his voice is still pristine. Think of it as seeing SCC at 1/4 power. Both vocally and musically the performance suffers. I could not wait for the concert to end. I am a big fan that has seen him many times; this time I was disappointed.Rent it first then decide if you really want it. It is still SCC and he is still a great artist.
4,Buy it,Short Review - This is a pleasure to watch and listen to. I knew these lads were great - just never knew how great. Great guests giving great performances. If you collect country music - collect this!
5,Excellent Album!!!!,"Where to begin? Jinx is an incredible guitar player - he expertly covers everything from rockabilly to country to jazz to surf music. If you like twangy rockabilly guitar, you will not find a better CD! Buy this, buy it now!"
4,Not quite memory foam,"It helped my IKEA bed feel a lot more comfortable. However, its pretty much just normal foam. Not at all like a tempurpedic memory foam. An egg crate might be more comfortable."
3,Oxford not so Illustrious,"While Pride & Prejudice is everyone's favorite novel, avoid this edition. The typeset is horrible which makes it hard to read. There are no illustrations. Buy another version; make this one into a purse."
3,Consider another publisher/edition,"As a die-hard Jane Austen fan, I believe that one can never own too many copies of ""Pride and Prejudice."" It is an engaging novel and my favorite among her works. This particular edition (Chapman edition), however, is not appropriate for the average reader. A Norton Critical Edition, for example, will footnote and explain certain concepts that are unfamiliar to contemporary readers. The Chapman edition focuses instead on correcting the mistakes of previous editors. Also, my copy has a recurring typographical error--the first word on each page has been accidentally duplicated on the previous page. This edition's main merit is the essays in the Appendix. They are excellent."
4,What's Your Philosophy,What you think of what makes this book unique is what you think of the mid eightys publications of bodo linhoff on pinch technology. If nothing else the text doesn't cover fluid flow very well.
3,Cuts in dust boots,"I bought two of these, and both had half inch long cuts on one of the dust boots. I decided to use them anyway, rotating the dust boots so that the cuts were on the bottom. No problems with fit or function (1993 Geo Storm)."
3,"It's a good book, but your vet may have different advice!","This is a pretty informative book, but I found that there is still some basic information that is not mentioned. For example my vet said a 3-week heat cycle for a mare's first March heat is not unusual. The book never mentions it. It also doesn't say anything about dealing with a virgin stallion. My vet had different advice than they did on washing the stallion. Since he maintains a stud, I trust his judgement. It is still informative however and we'll have to see how the foaling part goes. Just wish it had more information in certain areas. It would have saved me a $70. trip to the vet for something that is normal."
2,A christmas present for my son,"My son had asked for a doctor kit from santa for christmas. He already has a bunch of stuff for a doctors kit so my mother thought it would be a good idea to get a stethoscope and some bandages and put our own kit together. This stethoscope was a good price for just playing, however it does not stay in his ears well and it is twisted funny."
4,Underrated to say the least,Another album that you will want to listen to again and again from beginning to end and not skip tracks. There is something very different about this band and this was clear from songs like Sunshine and Wannabe Gangsta from the first album. This album sounds like no other modern rock band - tracks 8 and 9 could have been Beatles or Beach Boys songs. Wheatus are all about fun but heartfelt lyrics and perfectly crafted melodies.
2,Dissapointed,"So yadda yadda we were all introduced by teenage dirtbag, and just recently i saw the BMX Bandits video and it tottaly reminded me of thier one hit wonder, so i irrationally went on amazon and perchased 4 of thier cds, this being one of them, from hearing those 2 songs mentioned above i thought Wheatus would be a kid like fun group singing about teenage inocense. Boy was i wrong i know it says Parental Advisory Explicit Lyrics on the cover but i thought it would be just some quick swear words.... pffff as of now im not going to be a fan of wheatus, their 2 hit wonders are great.... and thats the bottom line, well c when i get the rest of the cds"
4,Nice little book,"This is not a textbook by any means, it is a collection of small papers on various topics in physical optics. Michelson's name is well remembered thanks to his contribution to interferometry and optical testing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in physical optics."
2,THINK TWICE.,"AFTER READING POSTED REVIEWS I PURCHASED THIS CD. TO SAY I WAS DISAPPOINTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 13 POORLY PRODUCED, POORLY PLAYED SONGS, THAT SOUND AS IF THEY WERE RECORDEDIN SOMEONES GARAGE, USING ONE MICROPHONE .THEN THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU."
3,"A good album -> 3,5 stars",This is not of their best albums but a nice one. The songs are between average and good (Motorhead - Iron Horse). ITs not a must album unless you are a very fanatic friend of Motorhead (Personally i am). If you are new star with Ace of Spades and Overkill.
3,Just OK,"I can see why the reocrd executives refused to sponsor this album when it was first recorded back in 1977. It is definitely not their best work (even frontman Lemmy Kilmister admits this) and the sound of the record is substandard, making one think that the engineers didn't know what they were doing. Lemmy rather talks the lyrics rather than shouting them in true Motorhead fashion. The music is heavy, but kind of slow and the hard edge that Motorhead is so famous for doesn't seem to have developed here yet. Good for those interested in rock history or any confirmed Motorheadbangers, but basically out-of-date."
4,"great product, terrible instructions","Love this pump and filter system. It works beautifully. My one complaint is that the instructions are lacking. If you give it some time, stay patient, you will figure out how it all works together."
1,THE FEAR OF THE TRADITIONALIST,"I OWN A CEV BIBLE AND READ IT FOR TWO YEARS.I FIND NOTHING ANTI-CHRIST ABOUT IT.THE CEV BIBLE IS CLEAR AND TO THE POINT.IT IS TODAY WHAT THE KING JAMES VERSION WAS TO THE 16TH CENTURY LAY PEOPLE IN THEIR LANGUAGE OF THE TIMES.I OWN THE NIV,RSV,JERUSALEM BIBLE,AND THE DOUAY-RHEIMS TRANLATIONS.THE CEV IS USED WHEN I HAVE TROUBLE COMPREHENDING THE HISTORICAL BIBLES.THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGES ARE MORE INCLUSIVE THAN THE ENGLISH LANGUGE ALLOWS.ROBERT M. R. -SAN ANTONIO,TX"
2,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"I'm not calling this the worst book ever, because I frankly never underestimate the ability of commercial authors to put out drivel. It is however, hands down, the worst book I've ever read...and I've read a lot of really bad books. This book gets 2 stars from me as opposed to 1 because it was so poorly written that it was actually funny. I haven't laughed out loud that many times while reading a book in a long time. Unfortunately, I don't think that it was meant to be a comedy. It read like a 13 year old wrote it. The dialogue was unnatural, the social commentary laughable and unbelievable, and the characters unsympathetic. By the end I was wishing for the book's villan, ""One-Eye"" (yeah, I got quite a few laughs out of that appellation), to actually succeed in killing all the other characters. I'm sure that if you're in the mood for a Cassie Edwards romance or a Native-American themed novel, you can find much better out there. This one just doesn't make the grade."
4,Good Read,"This book did tend to flow a bit quick and things seem to happen so ""easily"" for the main charecters. However the book is well written and the story line is very action packed. The overall frame of the story could have used a little more ""foundation"". Not the best Cassie Edwards book I have read but if you are and Edwards fan it is worth reading."
5,sounds of home,This is one of my most favorite Christmas albums. It both sounds and feels like New England. Listen to this music when gazing out into the snow--it makes you feel at home!
3,"I lost the ChristmasTide 2 cd. It was, I thought a bit more melodic.","I lost the ChristmasTide 2 cd. It was, I thought a bit more melodic. The first one just didn't resonate with me as much. However, if you enjoy a less intrusive, un-amplified sound, it might be what you want to hear."
4,The Cocoa B'z rip the mic again,"""The Rude Awakening"" was not a disappointment for me because I copped this Cd first than ""Dah Shinin'"", so it was hella tight for me. But buying ""Dah Shinin'"" i realized Cocoa B'z sophomore album was not a 5-star classic release. This album has a lot of good joint like ""Myah Angelow"", ""Memorial"" with the reggae-king Eek-A-Mouse, ""Black trump"" with Rae and ""Game of life"" with FLOW. Telling the truth, I liked all the songs. my fav. is ""Back 2 life"" with that Mobb Deep sample. It sounds phat! I think this album is aight but not a ""Dah Shinin'"". But I gotta admit that the Cocoa B'z is one of the realest hip-hop crews around! And that's a fact! Told: 4-star release."
3,I got a letter from the corporate the other day...,"Good comeback after their classic first album and their legal troubles with their name, etc. The lyrical skills are there (steele especially -- tek's nasal voice and preoccupation with bob marley get annoying), and there are several great songs on this album, but there are also a few clunkers and a couple with the dreaded R&B choruses the BCC has suddenly become fond of. Overall it's better than most rap releases that get a lot more attention than this, but no one should even consider buying this album unless they already own the classic, ""dah shinin""."
4,Smif N-Wessun is back this time as Cocoa Brovaz,This is a good release they have some hardcore Rhymes on this.yes at times they are not the best raps but they are pretty good.Not up to par with Dah Shinin but it works out good.Lyrics-8 Production-7 X Factor-7 Classic-8 Replay-7Total=7.5 out of 10 Fingers
4,Rude Dogs,"The same stick up boy flow is there. The Beatminers are in effect again, so is the entire BCC. Ruck especially shines on Maya Angelow. The name is the only thing that changes, along with the beats reflecting more regions than BK. That explains the fuzzy reception from journalists but street regulars know Buktown is everywhere. Highlights of this joint is Bucktown USA, The Cash and Still Shinin."
3,A good comeback with a few lapses!!,"Overall, the return of the artists formerly known as Smif N Wessun is a good comeback, however, the high anticipation behind this album will definately have some disappointed. The lyrical content is still there (check out ""Black Trump"" with Raekwon the Chef) but sometimes the production falls a little short of the lyrics or vice versa. Maybe if they would have had Self, Grand Daddy I.U. and Smoke produce like they did on Heltah Skeltah's Magnum Force LP, this could've been greater. Good but not grand."
4,blazin,"I had never really delved into Smif n Wesson's material and when I heard all the hype about this album I decided to buy it. They really live up to the hype, from the stylins of ""Won on Won"" to wu-induced ""Black Trump"" they got the skillz and truly are one of the more talented groups out there in the ""underground""- just cuz you on the radio doesn't mean you can rhyme. Other good tracks are ""Bucktown"" and ""Spanish Harlem"". Check it out!"
3,"Season 3: Part 1, hit a new high for the series...Part 2 stumbles...","I love SGT Frog.Part 1 made me LOL, pretty much the whole way through. Party two had a few good lines to make me laugh, but the laughs weren't as often, the pacing of the series was slower... It just felt boring compared to Part 1, it's like Part 2 was filler... I can't really explain it. I hope the show rebounds, what a disappointment. It's still better then the last part of Season 2. Just not the epic success that part 1 was."
3,"Nutro, Natural Choice Tartar Control Biscuit, 21 oz","Nutro, Natural Choice Tartar Control Biscuit, 21 oz is not the product I thought it was going to be, I was looking for Nuto's chicken, brown rice Tartar control biscuit. This product is made with Wheat.I will use these up, but will be more careful in my next order.Thank you"
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"I had some great Speedo flip flops for well over 5 years, when they finally kicked the bucket I decided I would try Speedo again. These flip flops are not nearly as good. The part going between your toes is thick, so it can get irritating. They are not soft, the bottoms are very hard plastic, which isn't what I was looking for. Its not worth returning them, since few other types are available in my large size, but I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,The Gift of Forgiveness,"This is an essential book for every believer, preferably the new believer. In fact, this book should be a requirement for all new believers who come into the faith. I'm an older believer and by reading this book my eyes were enlightened in many areas I was blind to. Not only does Pastor Stanley teach you the how to, and why you should forgive, but he gives you review exercises to do after each chapter that cause you to remember what it is you read. Answering the review questions, makes the book more personable and relative to the reader.Thank you Dr. Stanley for showing me through the Word of God what has been lacking in my life. I'm now living what I read and will never go back to my former mindset. I have been forgiven and set free; and whom the Son sets free, is free indeed!Love and blessings to you,Petra Gonzalez"
5,Life Changing Book,This is a must for all Christians....A MUST!! Liberating...The book deals with past hurts..the effects of bitterness...Instructions on how to forgive...FOR REAL!!
3,OK,"Ok for the price, kind of short, the skewers are 10 in long including the ring. I Hope this help."
5,Good Product,"These skewers work well for barbecuing outside. They are sturdy and easy to clean. The skewers also hold many vegetables, meats, etc. because of their length."
