3,Behind the Scenes / Republicans and Democrats,"This book is a ""must"" for those who follow the politics of the United States. The book covers the terms of several of our latest presidents and comments on who the ""movers and shakers"" really are... It identifies who are the driving forces behind some of our biggest political decisions...and surprisingly, it's not the president.For those not politically inclined, this book will be boring."
4,Belle France Interratial,"An Afro-French boy adopted by childless family of a Christian devotee grown up with a cute native local girl he played de-facto sexually since early years with.Got married at eighteen to his sweetheart, this young man was mistaken by a Bosnian migrant as a rapist drug dealer but happy end of Belle France story is predictable for young people also their funding a defence fathers' future is not so clear at all.Beautiful young bodies making sex are always in demand in any opus cinematographic worldwide."
1,Book Offers Mixed Signals,"As a concerned adult, I was not pleased to see that all the girls represented in this book had the look of fashion models. Various body types were not present nor were they celebrated. Two major stuggles for teenage girls today are body image and beauty. Teenage girls do not need anymore media telling them that only thin and acne-free is beautiful."
3,"Pretty, but not always on target","This is a beautiful, full-color, artistic look at what it means to be a young woman today. The book is encouraging and upbeat in tone, with lots of pictures and bright colors. The advice is good and primarily focused on nurturing the spirit. This would be a great gift book for a teenage girl.However, there are some problems with this book that I'd like to comment on. First, as many people have already mentioned, all the girls featured in the book are thin and attractive. A book meant to be for all girls should have girls of all body types in it. Second, a lot of the text is in silver ink, which is really hard to read in anything but bright lighting. Third, some of the pictures are repeated for no good reason, except for maybe filling space.Despite all this, I still really like this book, and I'll probably be buying Girlosophy 2."
4,Great CD.... even better artist!,"If you're reading this review you must already have an interest in Sam Roberts... good for you! He's the greatest thing to come out of Canadian music in my opinion. I say this not only for this album, but also because of Chemical City.'We were born in a Flame' is a collection of great songs, and I highly recomend checking it out. Sam Roberts will be considered 'classic' one day. I don't want to go off and compare the sound to other artists, there's too many... but I do hear hints of Beatles. I'll leave it at that."
4,Excellent!,"While perhaps not as hard charging through the whole album as the reviews might suggest, you will find the album on your regular play list. In fact, many times I catch myself listening to other things like commercials, etc and think that reminds me of this album, I had better give it another play. You will too. No idea if Sam Roberts is a passing phase but the album will stand the test of time..."
4,"Awsome cd, better live but id still buy it","this is a really good cd. where have all the good people gone and the big hit dont walk away eileen is what got me hooked. I saw these guys play live and it was the first time i ever heard them and i can say they are much better live than in studio... but still, its a good cd, buy it"
5,Review from his own family,"I thought this album was absolutely cool!! Well, being related to Sam is also cool. I first heard the album in 2003, when my uncle (Sam's dad) sent some copies of the album down from montreal. The first copies of the album in South Africa!! Buy this album, its really worth it, and the songs are quite catchy. You won't be disappointed!!"
2,i am the only one?,"yes sam roberts is good, but so are all the bands he covers on his album. maybe i'm just nuts, but almost every song i hear somehow regurgitates a riff or vocal hook from bands that did it better. there's one track that i mistook for an all apologies cover until i heard him singing, and then i recognized the vocal line from something else i've heard before. yes, most bands show signs of influence, but this is outright deplorable. i dunno, maybe he should be commended for his ability to combine old music, but i'm not sold."
4,Eclectic pop-rock,"I was surprised to find some people disappointed with this album... there's something here for everyone. I bought this cd for the song ""Brother Down"", which includes elements of rock and hip-hop (and has potential to make it big on american charts). I also found out this cd was the ""official summer cd"" last year in Canada which made me want to buy it even more. Anyway, other songs include elements of guster-like catchiness, beatles-like melodies, stones-like energy, jack johnson-esque laid back jams, and something else that's all their own as well. I think if this band got decent airplay in America, they could be the American ""summer cd"". I'd say keep an eye on this band cause one of these days, someone's gonna see them and then they'll turn out to be the next big thing."
3,disappointed,"I bought this CD because the song ""Brother Down"" rules. However, the version of the song on this cd is not the original! It is not nearly as good! Also, although there are a few good songs on this collection, I was generally very disappointed in it."
2,Not so talented,"Ok, the cd sounds ok (polished studio recording), but if ever hear him live, you'll quickly realise how bad he really is. I've heard him on the SARS concert and compared to the other bands on stage, his performace was really weak. He could barely keep a note... Real disappointment.If you want good Canadian rock music, go with the Tea Party. They never disappoint, whether it's a cd or live on stage. Tragically Hip is also good."
3,Entertaining but superficial,"A British professor with no special knowledge of Japan goes there for a year and tells you what happened, and how it is.Japan Unbound by John Nathan offers much more. I also liked The Japanese by Peter Tasker"
1,There are No Koans in this Book!,"This is a horrible book, not only are there no koans in it, but the illustrations are dreadful! What it is, is a mind numbingly inane psuedo dialogue between a very snotty zen master & a sterotypical western/christian pinhead. It is minimal and pointless. ( 0 Stars )"
5,"ZENZEN or ""Not...at all!""","The caricature, the ""What's that?"", the word-play, the choice of punctuation, the ...,...subtly Socratic for ""individual"" consciousness.Belongs, like Zen, in the Self Help Catagory:See it all or not at all!"
3,Should've been better,"Who ever decided to put certain tracks on this album did a good job, considering almost every Jigga classic is on this one CD. I just don't understand how they could leave out Jay-Z's collabo with his mentor Biggie on ""Brooklyn's Finest"". That is probably the best Jay-Z songs ever.Also, another downside to the album is that almost half the songs are the radio-edit version. I'm sorry but edited tracks do not belong on a greatest hits compilation.If you may have noticed, a lot of the songs are from Vol. 2...Hard Knock Life. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though. That is probably my 2nd favorite Jay-Z LP (behind Reasonable Doubt)If you ask me, you're better off leaving this one on the shelves, cuz it realy isn't worth the buy."
2,Jay-Z's Greatest Hits,"First of all I would like to say that it is impossible to have one CD with Jay-Z's best tracks! There is just too many for one CD. Here are my personal favorite tracks:1)Money, Cash, Hoes (remix)2)City is Mine3)Things That You Do4)Girls, Girls, Girls5)Hola Hovito6)Change Clothes7)Do It Again8)Moment of Clarity9)Change the Game10)Many Hoes11)Jigga My Nigga12)Best of Both Worlds13)U Don't Know14)Encore"
4,escanaba in da moonlight,If you want to get some real belly laughs read this book. It was well written. Can't wait for the movie to come out on video. I think it will become a real cult film!
4,Michiganders and Hunters will love this movie!,"Anyone who lives in da UP knows that people do talk like they do in the movie, contrary to some previous reviews. Some parts of the movie were exagerated but that makes it funny! I thought the element of the Wisconsin Beer the ""Schlitz"" was true to the UP culture! One would only understand this detail worth mentioning if you understand that the football team of the UP is the Greenbay Packers of Wisconsin and not the Detroit Lions of Michigan. Also, every true hunter has some secret to ""bagging the big one"" that is like the ""Bearwak"" in the movie. Additionally, everone who has been to Deer Camp has stories that are like the ones portrayed in the movies.If you like pastys, beer, and hunting; you will like this movie."
5,another Michigander weighs in,"I haven't read the book, having ordered it today, but have bought two copies of the movie. One for my wife and I, and another to give out. I may have moved here from the South, but I grew up in the MidWest and went to 'deer camp' in Pennsylvania with my Dad's family. Now that I live in MI and am married to a lifelong resident, I have to go to the UP soon. We may even retire there in a few years. This was the funniest movie we've seen in years. Hey! We bought TWO copies, AFTER seeing it in the theater! That should say it all, right there. We've never done that before, and never again, likely. A must see for all deer hunters, deer widows and Michiganders. We laughed until we cried. Our stomaches were starting to hurt."
5,Escanaba In Da Moonlight,"I thought the movie was hysterical. I insisted that my hunting, fishing husband see the movie. I am hoping that it is put out on videotape so it can be shown to his fellow hunters and fishers together."
4,This was SO FUNNY!,"Having just moved to Michigan from the south and not quite understanding all about the area.....this was surely an eye opener! I actually had to take a trip to the UP to ""see for myself"". I keep hoping it will be released on video!"
1,Escanaba In Da Moonlight,The book has nothing to do with Escanaba. The people of Escanaba do not speak that way. I see no humor in the story. Can't imagine why it was put into print in the first place! It's a waste of anyone's money!!!
4,A real page-turner with a fresh hook,"I'm not much of a war story reader, and I haven't read many spy thrillers, but this book is sort of a mix of both of these things with a heavy dose of cynical fantasy thrown in, and I really loved it.I think you can truly judge the merit of a book by the opinions of the crossover readers who might not usually pick up such a book. I couldn't stop turning the pages, as there was an intriguing revelation every few pages or so. The dialogue was very natural and the description was minimalist but well done. The character development also was pretty good, but the book really shines on its action.I found the golems to be very interesting characters and was fascinated by their actions throughout the story.If Irvine was able to get me reading about one aspect of life in America during World War II, he's a brilliant writer indeed, because I usually avoid that sort of thing. I'll definitely be looking for more of Irvine's writings."
2,Unfocused and dull,"I was captured by the first line (""Midnight in the golem factory""), and was engaged in the world for the first forty pages. Unfortunately I could not feel anything for the shallow characters. I felt as if Irvine was trying to show us a day in the life of 1940s what-if America, but instead just felt yanked through did-you-knows about the era. Could not feel any real life from the characters, let alone purpose.Interesting hook that fell flat with execution. Two out of five stars."
2,What is the purpose of this story,"Usually when you read a book, you can guess what the author is trying to tell you. Either it's an emotional story about some problem, or a detective/PI trying to solve a murder/crime, maybe it's even a sf writer trying to tell a future or alternate history story.But, I can't for the life of me figure out what Irvine is trying to say in this novel. It's almost as if it was a class assignment that had to be a certain length and related to WWII.Most of the characters are one dimensional, and you never (at least I didn't) have any reason to care what happened to Jared Cleaves or his family or Detroit for that matter. Except for the excursion into magic dwarfs, golems and a dragon, the fantasy aspect is pretty thin.Very disappointing after all the hype."
3,Not Received,"We never received this item from the original order, and re-ordered it in December, 2006. Elanders"
2,Worst of the series so far,"This book was clearly the worst of the series so far. The first three (in particular Insurrection, the 2nd book) was amazing to read. Probably one of the best Forgotten Realms novels ever--nothing but action action action from start to finish--cool spells, cool monsters, cool locations. Condemnation, the 3rd book in the series, while not as good as the 2nd, was still a pretty fun read, especially when the characters are fighting in the Abyss. These are clearly high level characters in what makes for another good read. Smedman completely missed the ball with this book. It was boring, slow, and not really that interesting. Not a series killer, but pretty close. Nothing happened, just a very transitional book."
2,sigh,"One of the worst collaborative books I have read. The series began with three well written books, and although each book was written by a different author and each had their strengths and weaknesses, they did seem to flow as part of a larger story. However this book is by far the weakest and reads as if the author did not even read the first three books or collaborate on character development and story lines with the other authors. I had to make a decision to quit reading the entire series because of the vapid writing in this book or force myself through it to get to the last two books. The author does not write well as part of a collaborative series. Arbitrary changes to characters and shallow story lines created a book that changes the story line of the entire series, making it challenging for the follow on authors to develop the characters. This series could have been amazing, but because of the poor writhing in the fourth book, I almost cannot bring myself to continue."
5,Awesome Series,"Incredible six part series ""War of the Spider Queen"" is best of the best when it comes to F.R. fantasy novels. I am a big fan of the Drow and love the chaos their lives cause. I will forever be a Salvatore reader and recommend this book and it's entire series to any fantasy novelist. An author as good as Salvatore can ensnare you from first word to last quotation, so read on and enjoy!"
4,"Well Written, Well Paced","It's a well-paced, fun book, that's fairly action packed. It's fun to read a book about an adventuring party where everyone is evil. Alliances change and anyone can be backstabbed on a whim. The story of this book focuses more on Hallistra, as the party continues to search for Lolth. It's one of the more enjoyable books of a great series."
1,Is this the same storyline?,"I read the first 3 books in the series and they flowed pretty well, the authors writing style and approach made for seemless transition from book to book. That changed dramatically with Extinction. This bears very little resemblance to the first 3 and if it weren't labeled book IV I would take it for being an unrelated story and characters. I do hope the next 2 are better, this was a very painful read."
5,Extinction by Lisa Smedman,"As are all the books that I have read from the War of the Spider Queen series, they are truly a masterpiece of writing. But Lisa Smedman eloquently adds her own flavor of the tale of the drow adventuring party who are in search for their ""lost"" goddess. I find that in her book, the characters of Pharun and Ryld are more in-depth, while the actions sequences in her novel are equally impressive to that of R. A. Salvatore. At first I was skeptic on how a woman author might take this series on, but I was impressed nonetheless. I also am glad to hear that Paul S. Kemp is going to write the last book of the series. He is freaking awesome, dark fantasy is truly awesome. Its what the fantasy genre is all about, not some white unicorn prancing around while little brownies play merrily under it. Well, its a mixture of the two but nevertheless I am very excited. Paul S. Kemp RULES!"
2,What a BIG let down!!,"To think we had to wait for that! The first three books were so amazing I didn't think anyone could have messed the story up, until Extinction. In my opinion the characters personalities were way off in this book. The story didn't seem to accomplish anything and was boring. The others seemed to have a direction or goal and by the end they achieved that goal. It lacked the use of interesting spells like the first three. Smedman seemed to use only the basic spells, nothing interesting or new. It did accomplish one thing, it left me wanting. Now I'm no expert or anything like that. These are just the opinions of someone who has read a few books."
5,What It Is !,"I've got the old albums but I've never been able to find all these selected tracks on CD's. It's as though this CD was put together just for me! When people think of the Temptations, they always mention the sounds of the early and mid 60's and never the rest. Most groups die when the music changes. However, the Temptations always changed when the times called for change. This is why they were the best and continue to be the best ever. No one has ever been able to harmonize like these brothers no matter who was in the lineup."
4,Not the American double CD version... But very good anyway,"These superb Soul singers, got involved in this ""Psychedelic"" project and produced an album full of extraordinary performances!Check out these two, among others: ""Papa Was A Rolling Stone"", and the most successful version of ""Law Of The Land"", originally performed by The Undisputed Truth.The sound quality is quite good, considering these recordings were originally made at the beginning of the 1970s."
3,Long versions of the hits,Extended versions of Papa and others. Only regret is the Bass could have been deeper in the mix. Tiny and light on most songs.CC
2,Poorly indexed but has some useful information,I think you should read this book cover-to-cover for greatest benefit. The indexing and organization are poor for referencing on an as-needed basis...making it fairly useless in an emergency situation.
4,Great Gift,"I purchased this as a gift and put it in a black frame for my father for Christmas one year. He is a big Ansel Adams fan.He really liked it, and it is now on a white wall, looks great.Pros:Clear picture with great detail.No uneven edges or fuzzing.Black and white with many dimensions.Looks great on a white wall with black leather furniture in the room.Cons:Came rolled up, so it had a few creases, nothing too bad though."
2,Thank God the Picture is Nice,16x20 not such a big size when you think about it. Ours came back wrinkled in a small tube...glad I didn't pay more than $5 for it!
4,Good Companion for The American Heritage Dictionary,"I'm very impressed with all of the American Heritage books. Very helpful. I use them every day, personally and professionally."
5,PMH NJ,"This watch is absolutely gorgeous and my boyfriend LOVES it! I highly recoommend the watch, and it was here the day after I ordered it (even though I chose standard service)."
3,Refill...,"My mistake, I really wanted the refill parfum but since there was no photo I mistakenly ordered this one. Unable to correct this with costumer service because of the mailing fee involved ( Hawaii) I accepted delivery. The aroma is still wonderful but I wish it fit in my small parfum holder."
4,Sugar Ray keeps on inflicting hits!,"14:59 is already a great album, but when combined with this Tour Edition, it's one of the best ever. It has the regular 13 tracks plus five bonuses: 1)Fly 2)Aim for Me (Main Version) 3)Every Morning (Live Acoustic) 4)Falls Apart (New Radio Edit) 5)Rivers (Non-LP Version) Fly, their breakthrough song with Super Cat is cool plus the extra versions of their other-chart topping songs are cool (Although the country-esque Aim for me sounds crazy =) Rivers, that song from the Scream 2 soundtrack takes you back to the Lemonade & Brownie days.So really, get this album if you're (even remotely) a fan. The extras definitely make it worth the cash."
2,I'm a dissenter here,"I picked up ""The Alchemist's Daughter"" expecting to read something rich with alchemical lore. I wanted something magical like the superb ""Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell."" Instead, the book was nothing more than a historical romance--and I am not a romance reader.The heroine was extremely unlikeable, because she kept everything inside, made no friends, and didn't even ask about the world outside her home. So, when she is taken for a ride by the errant husband (and I could see he was trouble the minute he entered her home), I could hardly feel sorry for her. She was a perfect sheep ready for a fleecing.I'd give this book only one star if it weren't for the fact that Katharine McMahon can really write with authority. Her descriptions are lush and elegant and it was this element of her novel that kept me going to the end. Sorry to say, I even found the ending lacking. And I learned nothing about alchemy in the process."
2,I like another's opinion of this book (bodice ripper with a brain),I only read half of this till I got to a rape scene that was too detailed. Up until then there was a lot of Science. On and on about alchemy and this poor sad girl who is her fathers science experiment. He takes notes and writes about everything she does and it is like one of his experiments. Poor girl is a mess but I really didn't care for her very much. The writing is very good and did hold me for a while.
3,Butterfly,"More a coming of age story than a bodice ripper or genre romance, The Alchemist's Daughter tells of the early experiences of a sheltered young woman with a remarkable education. Emily is an expert in the science of alchemy, the study of the forces of nature, but knows next to nothing about living her life or human nature. This novel follows her as she leaves her father's home for the first time as the starry eyed wife of an unscrupulous fortune hunter, about to learn the hard way about love, morality, and trust. Author McMahon plays out Emily's story against a vivid background of London society and backwater village. By the end of the novel, Emily's metamorphosis is underway. Could a sequel be in the offing?"
3,"good try, but falls short","The period detail is authentic as is the voice of the narrator, but the conflicts and plotline are predictable and less than compelling.A young woman unfamiliar with the ways of the world overlooks a worthy man for a pretty, unreliable one, stumbles and begins a long slide... and then finds her way back to the light.Stories are retold all the time, and retold in such a way that they feel fresh and interesting. This is not such a case."
2,Batiks,"Book is OK but if you are looking for quilt directions this is not the book for you. It is worth an hour of your time, no more."
3,Great,Great Book! Read it! Educational for anybody with this type of genetic and or chemical blood disorder. It can be very useful and lifesaving info.
5,"Very unusual, totally captivating","This is a special CD for people who like unclassfiable music. This CD will certainly put the listener in deep trance, even with a casual listen...a more focused listening...well...? I highly recomend this CD if you like ambient trance music...."
2,Old product sent.,I have used Dermalogica for many years and have used the Clearing Skin Wash for at least 2 years but something was wrong with this shipment.The formula did not foam up at all. Like it was old or wasn't the correct ingredients. I will not buy from this one again. I will make sure it is a legitimate Dermalogica store from this point forward. Waste of money-- which this stuff is rather expensive. Make sure you buy from a good salon or seller.
5,"One word, effective.",I have been using this product daily for the past 3 years for my moderate adult acne. It is the only acne facewash that has been effective in preventive breakouts while not irritating my skin.
1,Too drying for my skin,"I bought this because my sis told me that it helps her eliminates blackheads.Actually I've been quite worried that it could be too dry, and I'm right.My skin is quite sensitive and a bit dry, this product made it worse.It should be good for oily skin with acne prone."
1,21 Days Later Product Still Not Shipped,"I ordered this product just before leaving the country on vacation with the intent that hte package would be there when I got back. Ordered on 8/20/12, today is 9/11/12 and the product ""has not shipped"". Now I have to cancel the order and get from somewhere else since I'm completely out!"
1,"False advertising - this product is 8.4oz, not 16.9 oz as pictured!","This is a great product, but this seller needs to either fix the photo or list the product size in the description. The product is 8.4oz, not 16.9oz as pictured!"
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered ten items (the order was accepted as ""in stock"") and I received two items. Luckily the return process was easy."
1,1 of 14 wrong color mismatch,One of 15 lights I received had a pewter color instead of brass like the other 14. please send replacement asap
5,Nice candles,"Best flickering window candles I have come across. Color is yellow, which is correct. Flickering looks like a candle flame. Heavy base so it does not move around on a window sill.Don't know why folks are criticizing the color. It is not orange, and not white. It is yellow like a candle is."
5,looks great in the front windows!,"I have them (2) on the flicker choice and they look so pretty! Very nice that they come on and go off all on their own. Doing this for Christmas, but folklore has candels in the windows all year round."
3,Color not as shown,"In person the base looks very different from the photo. It's much lighter and has a bit of a gold tint to it. I don't think anyone would answer ""pewter"" when asked to describe the color. Maybe I just got a set from a bad dye batch, but I'm going to send them back and try another color. (And yes, the orange light is very orange, but I think I'm ok with that.)"
5,So charming!,"We are just thrilled with our purchase of eight Good Tidings Window Candles. They are beautifully made, and add a quaintness and charm to each of our windows. The flame is realistic, and I love that you can choose between the steady light or the flicker. We have had them ""burning"" around the clock now for 4 weeks, since they are light sensitive, and the batteries are still going strong. It will be hard to take these down after the holiday season...we may be tempted to keep them up year-round!"
3,"Would not buy again, would go to local discount store for half the price.","plastic, looks cheap in the day light. Over priced for what it is, but gave the effect we wanted at night."
4,WIndow Light,"These were perfect for my mom's house. She already had some - same design different color, but did not have enough for all her windows. Love the the light sensor feature. Not having to go around and turn them all on and off every night and morning is a huge plus. The LED is safe, although I wish they were a bit brighter. From the outside they looked a little dim. The small footprint fits nicely on the window sill. Overall, I would recommend these."
3,"Better than others I found, but still not exactly what I want.","I like having photosensitive, battery operated candles. However, I'm disappointed that the flame is not very bright. Also, the window latch prevents me from centering the candles in each window."
5,Great Buy,"Great buy!! It's sturdy and looks pretty. I love the sensor, that way you don't have to worry about going to every room to turn them on at a specific time. I have a set of the electric ones and the battery operated on/off ones and they never worked for me.The orange vs white light seems to be a preference. It has the orange light (as some people quoted, it gives a natural flame look) Although I would have rathered white light (it's brighter) it did the job for me.Finally, the candles don't have suction cups to hold them in place but there's a small latch that can go in between the window creases. I had some gaps in my windows because they are old but putting a small piece of duct tape between the candles and windows did the trick.Overall I'm very happy with this buy!"
4,"very nice, easy to use","These decorative candle lights are great. I love the flicker bulbs.. they trick everyone. Just realize that the ""flame"" of the bulb is very orange..so if you are looking for a white or bright light, this isnt for you.The daytime sensor makes a lot of sense though."
2,sensor does not work,"If these are a sensor light why do you have to turn on by hand at dark, and they go off in the AM.They should go on at dark & off at dawn by the sensor. There is no way to turn these on for the sensor option?These are not worth the headacke."
4,Great looking,I ordered these as a special deal. I didn't expect them to come without batteries! They take C batteries which are expensive. At first i almost sent them back because they looked a little cheap but once i put the batteries in and set them in my windows at the front of the house they looked lovely at night . They have the automatic on and off dusk to dawn switch which was great. When I would drive up to my house at night it always brought a warm feeling to me to see them dancing in the windows. I would recommend these even though you have to buy C batteries they lasted all Christmas season so a whole month and were still going strong when the Christmas decorations came down.
5,Looks more like candle flames than incandescent bulbs,Bought these to complete a set of 36 I bought two or three years ago. Requires two C-batteries that will last two month-long seasons of operation.
2,Not a bright idea...,"I read all of the reviews and had high hopes for these. I put one in a front window at my home in place of one of the plug-in candles I already had in place. Then I walked to the street (about 40 ft.) to see how it looked.It only took a minute to realize that they had to go back.The light is just not very bright. I had a hard time seeing it. The yellow/orange color doesn't really look like flame - not does it look white and bright as one normally sees in windows at the holidays. It's very artificial looking (to me.)They may be great for another application, but as holiday window lights, they're just not a bright idea. If anyone has found battery-powered holiday lights that are sturdy, timer-driven (or with a darkness sensor) that shine bright and look good, please let me know."
2,Way too orange in colors. Forget them for a Christmas light.,"I purchased ten. They are way too orange in color. Would work for Halloween but forget them for Christmas, you will be disappointed."
4,good product,"I'm quite satisfied with this product. The batteries operated all thru the Xmas season and the lights stayed firmly on the window sills in spite of my venetian blinds. The sensors worked without a flaw.Some reviewers were concerned about the yellowish light, but i was not. The lights could be a little brighter, but they are visible enough for passers-by."
5,Sensor window candles,I've had these candles in my windows since the day before Thanksgiving. It is now nearing the end of January and they're still going strong. I love them and would highly recommend them!!
2,"Lame story, Lame characters, Lame combat","I enjoy turn-based strategy RPG's but this game is an exception. The characters are plastic, badly voiced cookie cutters from any trashy anime and caring about them or their bland relationships is an exercise only fit for the most persistent and brave.Do yourself a favor and pick up a better turn-based strategy RPG. I can recommend a few: Disgaea, Gladius (flawed but fun), Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and Final Fantasy Tactics A2 Grimoire of the Rift."
2,I have been waiting for a fun tactics game ever since shining force III,"Unfortunately, the wait got longer. This game has soooooo much potential. but just like the rest of the suikoden series, it falls short. You can't power level in this game. When your characters dies, they really die! The story is slow. The special moves are lack luster. The graphics are boring and sub par, and the music is very typical konami. The truth is, I keep getting suckered into these suikoden games with the promise of rpg goodness, and instead I end up putting 30 hours into it, quitting, and selling the thing.If your looking for a top notch strategy game, this is not it. If your looking for a suikoden game, well this isn't it either. This is more of an experimental title that will leave you bored and constipated.Have fun."
2,another game,"This game was blah at best. When I bought this game I was looking for a game that would last me a while and was interesting at the same time. What I found in this game was one with horrible character development, terrible graphics and the gameplay itself wasn't all that great. I have plenty of time to play the game but I couldn't keep my attention on this game for more than maybe a half hour. After that it was all the same. The plot was poor as well. I spent a total of 23 hours playing this game and still understood nothing but one thing, without telling what that one thing is for those of you who still want to buy it, that one thing didn't keep my attention. Just a friendly warning that the review in game informers was right on this game. (6.5) If you are desperate and really need to have something to play by all means get this game but there are plenty of other games out there that are much better."
4,unsung hero at times,this game has a lot of pluses too it and only a minor draw back to it. the challenge level is one of the downsides as it goes from too easy at times to points where you rely heavily on luck to get through certain encounters.
3,Ugh,"I absolutely love Strategy RPGs but I found Suikoden Tactics the most frustratingly overly-complicated game I've played in the genre. Imagine a world where every freaking tile has a different elemental alignment which are either randomly generated or at least arbitrarily placed. Now imagine that these tiles drastically affect how strong your Att and Def are. It totally takes any fun out of the game and makes the strategy relate to the enemy units, but instead which freaking tile to stand on. Ugh."
3,Only magnetic on one end,These trains are decent value for the money but they are only magnetic from one end so it's not easy to show a toddler how to connect them with each other. The wheels are loosely attached and don't stay on the tracks as well as other trains I've purchased. I recommend the Imaginarium line of trains over these.
5,Devon loves it!,"I couldn't believe how fast this little train set arrived at Devon's house! I ordered it one day and before noon two days later, his mother called to tell me he was already playing with it--all over the floor, repeatedly jabbering ""Choo-choo... Choo-choo."" Too-ooo cute.This precocious, lovable little boy has always liked trucks, but recently branched out to firetrucks and trains, so Grandma just had to get him some starters. Yes, I bought him a firetruck, too, but that review will come later.I choseMelissa & Doug Wooden Train Cars Setbecause Melissa and Doug are known for exceptional quality, value, kiddie-safe products. What more could I want.We-ell, they were a few inches smaller than I thought they would be (from the photo); they could be a bit larger, but Devon isn't complaining, so I won't, either. I am happy when he is happy!Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, March 5, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books"
4,Very cute and fun,"We got these for my 19 month old and he loves them. The ends of the cars are magnetic, so he doesn't have to fumble with trying to ""hook them up,"" but the magnet could be about twice as strong. That's the only negative I have about this toy."
4,train cars set,Bought the train car set for my son and they are pretty good! Two of the cars have parts that come off of the car which is pretty frustrating for a small kid. If you kid can handle it then you will have no problems. Fit on Thomas the train wooden tracks great!
4,wooden train set,"I bought this for my son because I know there is no lead paint in Melissa and Doug products. He loves the train itself. However, 3 of the trains, the passenger ones are longer than most train cars and have wheels that pivot, this causes problems when trying to move the train on the tracks. My 3 year old gets frustrated because these three train cars are always coming off the track. He got these for Christmas and now, almost a month later, he no longer wants to use the three troublsome cars."
2,"A sturdy, good looking train that has a couple of design problems.","As one other reviewer has already pointed out, the cars are quite long and its easy for them to come off the track on sharp corners.The other issue is the way they are constructed, with pivoting trucks at the bottom of the train attached to the body by rivets. The bottom parts of the rivets hang down under the train and catch on places where the tracks are not completely level. Any track joint that sticks up a little bit or a countersunk screw that is not completely flush hits the train and makes it come off the rails. One could say the problem is with the track and not the train, but my son's set has several different brands of trains and this is the only set that has a problem on the track.I was excited to find a modern looking train to add to my son's set, but I do not think this train was the best choice. I don't recommend it, especially for younger kids who get frustrated when things don't work right."
3,solid but need more connection support,"I got this train set and the figure 8 track for my 3 yr old nephew. He loves trains but plays with this only occasionally, probably in part because he has tons of other toys in addition to this. He seems to like it but he gets frustrated when the trains don't all stick together if you try to hook up all 6. After pulling it across the short track and around the bends, one train in the middle will quickly fall off track and break the set. So, we've found that if he only has two to connect together, he gets less frustrated. The other 4 just seem to get left on the tracks and not pulled along."
4,Melissa & Doug Wooden Train Car set,Bought this for a Christmas Charity gift. I liked that it came in its own case and it looked like it was very sturdy for lots of hours of play.
5,So much fun,"I purchased this to host games at my mom's 60th birthday. Her peers really enjoyed it, not to mention as well as her kids and grandkids. Music always makes things fun."
5,Good Book,Bought this for my Dad and he loves it! I can't think of a better book for an oldies music lover!
3,A ripping yarn! :P,"Although not as good as the Eisenhorn series by the same author, these are still a lot of fun. Few authors do two fisted sci-fi adventure as well as Dan Abnett!"
4,"Drunks, Drugs and Debt is on the money","This book is just too close to home. Finally a book describes exactly what an addict acts and looks like. It is almost like a sci-fi movie, where the main character suddenly sees these destructive beings. Better yet, the book is a wake up call for some of us who keep making real bad choices in choosing partners in business and personal life.Pulls no punches. Wish that I had read it 10 years ago and saved myself thousands of dollars and much heartache."
3,Quite entertaining,This was quite an enjoyable read. Mary Platt Parmele had an great turn of phrase and this is for the most part a quirky and entertaining history book.It is quite opinionated and often she doesn't bother to back up her opinions with facts or analysis. However most of what she says is pretty reasonable.The book is pretty short and it is no way comprehensive but it is very readable and quite witty and insightful in places.The note of optimism at the end of this book published in 1907 is pretty depressing.Sadly Russia was to endure a lot more misery both at the hands of its own rulers and from outsiders.
3,OK,This book was informative but not absorbing. It tells the history of Russia but not a personal history. There was no feeling for the characters or personality
4,After reading the italian version,"I think Milo Manara is one of the best italian artist. I loved works like ""Il gioco"" (Click!), ""Il profumo dell'invisibile"" or the new incredible adventure of G.Bergman, ""a riveder le stelle"" (""To see the stars""). ""WWW"" is just a little, but very nice, sexy story. If you are a Manara's fan don't miss this comic book!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I am a native from France. I bought this book to help my son practice for the French CLEP. I am shocked at the number of mistakes on practically every page! Innumerable typos, egregious grammatical errors, and what looks like a total disregard for accuracy make this the worst language book I have ever seen in my life. Do not waste your money on this garbage!!!"
1,The contents are unrelated to the actual exam,"Unfortunately, the contents of this test prep book are unrelated to the actual exam - it is a collection of multiple choice questions, without any explanations of answers or subject review material."
3,good at being what it is,"This isn't a baseball simulator. There is no season or franchise mode. This is a arcade style exaggeration of the sport something like the NFL and NBA Street games. However, it's a fun game to play. It's like having an espn ""web gems"" and ""touch 'em all"" highlights reel going in your default 5 inning games. Probably best to play against a friend or on-line. The gameplay is addictive, especially when your ace pitcher strikes out the side. Downside is the lack of realism, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as the real sport can be a snooze fest at times. I recommend it."
5,painfully delicious,"I really loved the whole idea of the book; there is nothing like being a teenager, no matter what decade the feelings are the same. It is indeed painful..but delicious."
5,Its the best,this battle master is the best of all you can lift up your foes person and frow it an the air
4,"Very good, strange at times, but still very good.","Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz have made some of the greatest tunes in salsa such as ""Aguzate"" ""Sonido Bestial"" and ""Los Fariseos"". Unfortunately, they have also released a lot of mediocre albums during their time, that's why I was skeptic when buying 1975. Luckily, I was surprised to find out this album is actually very good. It has a powerful rhythmic heavy sound that made me fan of theirs in the first place. ""Cristobal Celai"" and ""Juan Sebastian"" are both fantastic songs that display Richie's amazing talent on the piano and as usual, there's also some fantastic trumpet playing also. My favorite and the most recognized song on the album is ""Gan Gan y Gon Gon."" I have to admit though there are certain parts of songs that have strange singing and music for brief moments. Nonetheless, the album is worth getting in my opinion and much much better than other releases such as ""El Bestial Sonido"" and ""Back to Back."""
4,Fun!,"In a fun and silly novel,Ellen's dad is accused of being a mass murderer when gossip goes awry."
4,Just about the best,"I would like to be able to rate this book at 4.9 stars, because, in my opinion and by way of usage and reference, only one other usually supercedes it (the comprehensively illustrated ""AHS A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants""). Yet the Wyman's remains a valuable reference that I consult as a second (and often first) source of botannical and gardening information.The other readers' reviews here should give ample incentive to buy this book. Their words-""well researched"" [the book is thorough in its descriptions and definitions], ""full and opinionated"" [the writing is colorful and makes for interesting reading] and ""comprehensive"" [Wyman even gives the correct Latin pronunciation of each listed genus (I wish the AHS book did)]-affirm the book's usefulness."
4,great gift,i got it for gift for a friend and it makes a great stocking stuffer for the outdoorsman or just some one who lkes nature
3,Lost book found.,A good usable copy.Fast shipping.I had lost a copy some years back and needed a replacement for home my home reference library.
4,Great,"Just like I remembered from the 70's Full of handy information!,and the old fashin way of doin useful things!"
4,Expensive But Effective,"Yes, P & S Liquid is ridiculously expensive and really does exploit us poor psoriasis sufferers. That being said, it is very effective for scalp treatment for serious scalp psoriasis. I put it on my scalp overnight once a week. (Cover with shower cap because it is very messy!) I would never use it if it didn't do a great job of treating my poor scalp. I wash it out the next morning with tar shampoo - and then I use a tea tree shampoo to get that tar smell out and condition. It is a big hassle, but it clears all the psoriasis scales without causing sores. I have long hair and get many compliments on it. I do not have dandruff and no one notices I have psoriasis unless I tell them. It also relieves any itchy feeling. Dermas-Smoothe is a prescription drug that does a similar thing, but it has cortisone. I have tried mineral oil instead when I decided to avoid paying the price, but it truly does not work as well."
5,Oh my!,What a wildly salacious turn of music from the dynamic Kronos Quartet! Just when I thought I had them pigeonholed (lazy thinking on my part) they come up with something like this which radically rearranges my conception of what I previously thought they were capable of. Kudos! 5 stars.
3,I Think They Should Have Selected a More Contemporary Singer,"I love Asha Bhosle and one only has to listen to her Live at the Albert Hall album. Problem is, she has aged, and her voice shows it. Regrettably, her vocals on this album constantly remind me of this and I can't listen to the album with pleasure. I would say the same of such wonderful singers as June Carter and Amalia Mendoza. This was a wonderful opportunity to introduce much of the world to the zaniness of Bollywood movie music, with its fabulous arrangements and wacky use of all imaginable instruments from all over the world. Instead it makes me sad to hear Asha not at her peak."
5,one of my favorites,The plot is surely something we've seen before but so charmingly told by Joan Wolf. One of my favorites and highly recommended.
4,Good Show.,The show is good but not great. It is basically about 3 girls that are constantly time traveling in a magical house. They never get older but the friends or people they leave behind do get older. I got this for free so i can complain about it.
5,Fabulous Recording #2,"Derric Johnson's ReGeneration is one of the most incredible vocal groups to ever be recorded. Although some might have a question about some of his stylistic methods, the product is lush and beautiful. I have loosely followed this group for over 20 years and their Christmas recordings are my favorite. You will be astounded at some of the sounds that you hear. I listen to it over and over again each Christmas season. I was so glad to get it on CD as I had worn out my cassettes. For Christmas, I listen to traditions, classical, choral and orchestral recordings of which I have over 100.Vol. 3 & 4 are just as good as Vol. 1 & 2. I believe each Vol. has 10 songs, so you get 2 per CD. Not a bad deal and the music is just wonderful!"
1,not what i expected...,"i agree with the previous reviewer who said she has not read anything worthwhile from cabot since an ""improper proposal."" the characters from the books following ""improper proposal"" were very boring and the story lines were extremely bland and this book is no exception. i don't think i will be investing any more time with her work."
5,Groundbreaking book for the future,"Well, I don't know what happens in the field of psychology that people still don't recognize in a proper manner the incomensurable work this group of people have been doing (Watzlawick et al). First of all, for the didatic value of this book, secondly for the transforming insights that come trough reading it, and - but not least - for the kind of practic it ensues, I feel it is a book to be ""discovered"" yet, a book for the future of Psychology."
5,Book well worth reading by anyone involved in change,"This is a fairly short book, but don't let that fool you -- it is the start of a new science of change. Sounds awfully new-ageish, huh? Don't worry, the book is eminently reasonable, especially considering that it proposes that one way of introducing change into a system is through (apparent) paradox. The book is a must for anyone who is interested in either the theory of change or wants to know how to make changes that acutally work (especially psychotherapists).Brent Auble (aubleb@lafcol.lafayette.edu)"
3,What in the world?,I have seen that this book is a must read for family therapists. I finally had time away from my Ph.D. program to read it. Though it is well-written I have a problem with its content. I am sensitive to the self-esteem needs of the authors so I am not going to publish what I thought of the book. I have to say that there is at least one desenting opinion to the above reviews.
2,Rip Off!,"As a Shadows' fan from way back, I have all the tracks on the CD and bought the pack mainly for the bonus CD expecting something of use... the bonus CD consists of a quicky one page biography, another one a list of albums, a photo section of five pictures, and a supposed screen saver consisting of the front cover of the album..."
4,Feel-good harmonies and lilting melodies,"This CD is a great sing-along from start to finish. The melodies are memorable and the harmonies are lovely. I bought ""LP"" and was disappointed - I keep coming back to this one, and I've never found a bad track."
3,More than decent pop,"This is definitely pop with a capital P. I'm not a fan of pop - but The Rembrandts have something. It's melodic without being pompuous. Simple without being ridiculous. Nice'n'beautiful without being anonymous.The hit single and opener Just The Way It Is, Baby (yes, the one where the duet walks on a beach playing the guitar in the music video) remains the best song of the album. But none of the tracks are bad. Other highlights on this much-over-average light entertainment pop album include Save Me, Someone, New King, If Not For Misery, Confidential Information and especially Burning Timber. As you can see, they're all pretty alright!If you need to buy ONE pop album, The Rembrandts is the one!"
2,Remember: 5-stars=appeals to EVERYONE,"And as far as the teenage consumer force goes, only sappy ones who subsist on applesauce, baby food, and smoothies can enjoy this. My MOTHER asked me to turn this off because it was boring. Sure it's radio-friendly. Play it for someone with a heart condition or otherwise cannot get excited for risk of overstimulation/death. This is commercially accoustic Spam music, touching base with all the proven themes, polished to the point of nausea-induction. And give your albums some titles, for goodness' sakes. Are you artists or not? It's annoying how many better bands (even of this type) are out there and not half as famous as these guys. Maybe what we need is more citcoms...so they can all do sappy theme songs."
1,INCOMPLETE,I ORDERD AN ALBUM AND ONLY GOT 2 SONGS. OR SHOULD I SAY 1 SONG AND 1 MEDLEY OF THE REST. BITS AND PIECES OF SONGS. I WAS VERY UPSET. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU BUY AND WHERE IT COMES FROM.
5,"Swing, harmony and delight","One of the Desert Island discs in the genre of group vocals - which have included the Boswell Sisters, Andrew Sisters, and various teams otherwise depicted as Barbershop Quartets etc. Lambert, Hendricks and Ross managed to combine a delicious sound - not too sweet; a sensibility attuned to the jazz idiom; the feeling which is palpable that they loved what they were doing and you can HEAR that joy; a powerful swing; a poetic intelligence and understanding of lyrics and the dedication to get the music of Count Basie right for transposition to vocals. A gem of a re-issue. A classic. To listen to at regular intervals."
5,"Cinderella,Very Underated Band","Cinderella should get more credit then they do,and this DVD shows why.I saw Cinderella live for the first time this year and became a instant fan.This DVD has all the hits.If Cinderella comes to you'r town go see them,you'll be glad you did."
4,Great Video Collection,"this dvd has all the videos that i remember from the band and more. some of these videos i have never seen until now. but, what would have made an even better collection is if they would have included the live section of the night songs vhs. that's the only reason i don't give this dvd a whole 5 star rating."
4,Solid guitar-orientated progressive rock,"If you look for more than ""three minutes songs about teenage love"" in your rock music then this instrumental recording may be for you.Djam Karet has been compared to King Crimson, Pink Floyd and the Grateful Dead.The comparisons to King Crimson is certainly warrented. They both produce a wild, syncopated heavy-metal sound at times, but DK do not push the envelope as much as the King (Crimson that is). DK have softer more dreamy moments that do bear some resemblance to Pink Floyd. I haven't listened to much Grateful Dead, so I can't really comment on that comparison, expect to say that the recording does contain a number of rip-roaring, improv guitar solos (which I gather the Grateful Dead are known for).The CD has over 70 miuntes of music so its ""minutes of music per dollar"" rating is pretty good (if that matters to you).I have 3 of DK's CDs, all of them excellent, but this (in my opinion) is the best of them."
2,Too long for such a thin plot,"I liked Thea and the characters in her office. I found them to be interesting and believable. Thea's love interest, Andre, was less well develolped as a character and not particularly credible. The primary problem I experienced with the book was I thought the plot was quite thin and utterly predicatable. Thus, the book seemed to me to be about 100 pages too long."
3,Trivia game with T&A,"The Guy Game is a trivia-type party game with footage of girls filmed during spring break. You answer the same trivia questions they do, and you also have to guess if they got the answer right or not. The more questions you get right, the closer you are to seeing some uncensored topless action.So you get your nudity, but is the game good or not? For the most part, yes. The trivia questions are interesting, and the pinball style mini-game diversions are amusing for what they are. But to fully unlock each episode you'll have to play through them at least twice - once to see what the questions are, another to answer them correctly and get the highest score. The game mixes things up with new questions afterwards, but it gets a bit repetitive until then.You probably already know whether this game appeals to you (and you don't have to answer that out loud). If so, it's worth a try. But it's definitely banking on the T&A; factor first, and trivia second."
2,it was not what i was expecting!,"ok so this game is based on common knowledge questions from the early to late 90's, it is really boring and some of the girls are not much to look at. unless you like games with a lot of questions then i say stay away from this one . thankfully i only paid like $5 for it."
1,"A more accurate title would be ""The Frat Boy Game""","Wow. Ok. So where do I start with this one.Rented it with a friend for s***s n' giggles. But instead of laughing we just groaned and rubbed our temples in confusion as to why this would get any praise from anyone who doesn't have the mentality of a frat boy who only sees a woman as a pair of tits and an ass.The questions aren't anything remarkable either. Got bored with how diluted a lot of them turned out to be. The girls were .... ""pretty"" in their own respects although ""dead behind the eyes"" seems like a more applicable description. It's wasn't a funny/self-aware kind of bad. Just a confusing kind of ""why would someone make this"" bad.We should've known better as soon as we saw the cover. Clearly not meant for anyone who doesn't think like a 15-30 yr old manchild.I would also like to note I am not female before any flamers call me out for that or anything. Not like being a girl should make a difference."
3,great great little boardbook,"but it isnt toddler resistant. ours got torn up within a week. sad to report but i threw it away because it was not worth repairing. wasted money, but it was fun to read before he destroyed it. he doesnt destroy that many books either, so i'd say this one is flimsy."
4,Worst Witch.. turns out to be actually ok..,"To start off, I am Harry Potter's biggest fan. But I was disappointed when I heard only one book was written per year. To distract myself from reading the same 4 books over and over again, I decided to give this book/series a try, after being recommended by a close friend. Although these books are very short, and only takes me half an hour to read the 100 pages filled with big words, it reminds me of Harry and Hogwarts. The boarding school, which happens to have no name, is similar. If I compared this to Harry, it is a small version, best for younger children. It may not be as descriptive, but both of our young hero/heroines finish with flying colors.. and for that I applaud both Ms. Murphy. and Mr. Rowling."
4,Excellent resource for baby games,"I checked this book out of the local library and was so impressed I'm buying it. Concentrating on ages 0-24 months, this book is broken out in small month divisions so you are sure to find an activity right for your child's development age. Much better than other books that give 6 month ranges and often don't target young babies with few coordination skills. This book takes developmental stages and provides a few practical ideas that are easy to do in any home and often sparks ideas for your own homemade activities. A blessing for those trying to entertain babies all day long!"
4,Great Insight,"This book offers a great look into the actual meaning of much the NT. Much meaning and is lost in translation from Greek to English. This book reveals much of what is truly meant by Jesus and the authors of the NT. If you don't have the time to spend searching concordances and Greek dictionaries, or actually learning the Greek - this is the book for you."
5,Nice Remastering Job! Excellent Nanci - Great Box Set,this is the way I like it!4 albums on 2 cd's..couldn't have come at a better time since I just now discovered this inviting angelic heart warming voice.she is a beautiful ladythese are her beautiful songsHighly Recommended!
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Well and good if this software works for you. I recently downloaded the 06 version online and it did not. I decided to go with another software package that worked wonders. Although I had Viruscan Pro 06 on my system for less that 40 hours, & although the company proclaims a 100% guarantee, they have refused to refund my purchase price saying of all things I need to continue to work with them to TRY and make it work! Looks like an unfinished prototype rushed to market. There are other programs out there that need no user intervention. You want that, believe me. Why spend half your time on a system Troubleshooting when you could be using your system for whatever you bought it for!"
4,Husky Liner HHR,Husky Liner Cargo Liner for 2006 - 2006 Chevy HHRProduct arrived fast. Liner was rolled up when received but lays flat. Easy to clean and light weight for fast in and out of vehicle. Nice product for the price. Would reccommend to buy.
3,Okay..but gets worse as you go along,"I found the history part very facinating. But after a while it simply starts listing and listing journals and indexs and book reviews. I suppose if you are majoring in Library Science, then perhaps it might be usefull, otherwise I wouldn't buy it."
4,"Great title for your ""I bet no one else has THIS"" collection","Mustafa Ozkent's Orkestrasi is a Turkish funk machine. Genclikle ile Elele is their strongest offering and has recently been reissued for those of us who weren't around when it was originally released in 1973. Wait, did you say ""Turkish funk? Oh yes, that's right. Hints of Anatolian folk themes mix with in-the-pocket rhythms and spikes. Great stuff, really. The recording quality isn't the best, but for my money, that almost makes it seem even more authentic. If you want to blow your buddies out of the water, pick this one up and ask them one evening, ""Hey, how about some Turkish funk music?"""
4,Excellent,"No, that is not me in my review workshop. I am not that sexy.Mustafa Ozkent is a rediscovery of Andy Votel, who goes around the world, unearthing the psychedelic, the exotic, the funky that has long been forgotten or never in mind to start.This is one Votel's best finds. Ozkenrt's Glenclick Ile Elele is one slab or propulsive, synth driven dance music that never let's up. It is not psych and not disco, but mines a funky nitch in between. The slam and groove and crunch never let up.A rock and roll fan may have heard this in the mid-1970s and dismissed it as cheese, but hear it now, and that fan would be both kicking themselves and stomping on the dancefloor. The thing about cheese is, it is really yummy, and yummy does not get better than this"
1,a collection of bargain b-side christmas songs peppered with a few hits perhaps?,"What a sorry, ill-produced excuse for a compilation. It looks eclectic but is just a mess. It starts with a bunch of noise and proceeds to never finds its flow. Songs jarr from one to the next, making for terrible background music - ironic as having it on during gatherings is generally the idea behind a christmas compilation. At least my guests had a laugh at it. Many tunes seem like cheap b-sides that EMI probaby used for nothing. Even some of the songs with famous singers are lame, including the cheesiest rendition ever of ""baby it's cold outside"" featuring Dean Martin which isn't a patch on the Johnny Mercer/Margaret Whiting version, and the ill-chosen Leonard Cohen ""hallelujah"" which music producers seem to think people will be tricked into believing is a christmas song because it has the world hallelujah in it (I admire the song but not in this context)."
4,"Great bag, but heavy!","This is a great photo bag, with a couple of caveats.The bag is larger than I expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There is plenty of adjustable room for my Canon 40D SLR with attached 17-85 lens, and my Sony TRV-240 camcorder. I also have the video light for the camcorder, lens hood for the 40D and all the cables, batteries, tapes, manuals, etc., with room to spare.The biggest downsides to this bag, in my opinion, are its weight (12 lbs. empty) and the fact that you can't totally remove the harness system and just make it into a ""suitcase"". I don't plan on going hiking with the bag -- I just wanted a sturdy and safe bag to store all my gear in, and I found that in this bag.Other than those two points, this is a great bag which I would purchase again."
3,Fine bag but not for weaklings!,"Way to heavy for me. But hey, I'm a 50 yr old, 170lb weakling. I returned it."
3,Good but a little unsatisfacation,"I feel good is that I first listenned Cencic's performance, and think he is a really good contretenor, and have a broad range of voice. Besides. his soft but not strained expression is very nature and beautiful.You must feel strange why I just post 3 star. In fact, I think Cencic is a 5 star performer, but I don't prefer virgin's arrangement. In this set, there are much parts for overtures, it will let listenners confuse.Yes, I like Cencic's show and Rossini's music, but I want to pay to get more these association."
4,Terrace Downs New Zealand,A great birthday present from my daughter.Everyone justs grabs the book immediately and goes searching.I am however a little worried about the accuracy.Having recently played the beautifully scenic Terrace Downs course in Rakaia New Zealand I wonder about the description of hole no.16.It is shown as having a length of 220 yards!!!.This hole is about 140 yards maximum off the back tee.!! Even the commentary says the green is just a wedge away.I hope this example was an exception to the rule.Nonetheless a great book to have.All the best Andrew Hopkins Christchurch New Zealand
4,This band sounds like no other but yet they sound familiar,"Guitar, bass and drums is a well-worn concept in the world of rock music, but blending tight performances with compositions that are highly structured and shift tempo/mood often and dramatically, einstein avoids all the cliches of a power trio. i have never heard a band that sounds like this but at the same time there are so many references - a touch of country guitar here, surf rock there, King Crimson quotes, classical sounding chords in the style of Debussy, cartoon music - this music is FUN and INTERESTING and totally unlike any albums you own but not so weird you can't listen to it...closest thing i can think to compare it to is frank zappa without horns"
3,Home For Christmas,"I'm only halfway through this book and am fed up with the heroine (Sheila). I don't understand how she could place all the blame on the breakup on Jeff. She seemed to refuse to take at least some of the blame. The book is reading more like a pity party for Sheila. I also agree with the other reviewer, in that they are taking way to long to get together. I really enjoyed Alice Woodson's other book (Snowbound with Love) and would highly recommend that one."
2,Slow read......,"I was so happy to get to the end of the book. I wanted more dialogue with Jeff and Sheila. For once I was happy that a mother got in the middle of her daughters life. Sheila upset me with her selfishness. Jeff had a dream, but all she wanted to do was hold a grude because Jeff choose to enter the space program. Then she made the man suffer even though he tried to apologize. Upset me to know end. There are so many women that do that. His dream was THEIR dream, but she did not WANT to see it. The book was average."
3,Home for Holiday,"I enjoy reading this story, but could people that so well educated and people connecte coul not tell their strong , single child that she was half way wrong about the way things end between the two.If she understood his dream why couldn't it be a midway point, and why did he have to be 100 percent wrong in their split. The book took long to get them to come together for her to be willing to leave her home an wait on jeff."
1,close but off the mark,not good. songs are similar but off key from the originals. my mistake for not looking closer before ordering the cd
1,Don't Buy/No Synthesizers,"Just a kind warning, if you buy this cd it is Tommy and the boys minus their biggest characteristic, synthesizers. No wonder the price is so cheap, I thought I was just getting a good deal instead of a good screwing."
2,the music was remastered and sounds different than the original music.,"This CD is missing the raw energy that the original cuts had. It's to clean, doesn't sound like the good old days."
5,good music,"this kind of music brings back good memories for me, they were popular when I was a teenager. GOOD STUFF"
2,Not Original Recordings,"I ordered this product based on the customer image provided. I owned the pictured item on LP, and assumed the CD was the same item. It is not. What I received is a ""New stereo recording by original artist"" - part of the ""Legendary Artist series"". I was disappointed, especially because the LP pictured contained the long version of Crimson and Clover. The CD I received has a re-recorded short version."
2,Not as advertised,"I love Tommy James and the Shondells and was really looking forward to this CD. What I got however, is a newer version of their hits; not the original cuts. I believe the artists are TJ & S. however it just doesn't sound like the originals. Good price but that doesn't make up for the disappointment."
1,Not the original songs,"In a hurry to finish an order, I didn't check out reviews as I usually do... Big mistake. As others noted, these are RE-recordings, apparently by the original artists, but not the songs as we remember hearing them. Even if you're not very familiar with the original versions, I don't recommend this CD. It goes right into my ""Give to Goodwill"" box."
1,Not Quite Right ?,"I grew up with this music and it sounded ""not quite right"" when I first listened to it, like maybe it had been redone by another group or perhaps redone by an older Tommy James ? Upon further investigation, listening to older vynal, I confirmed and am convinced that the cuts on this CD are not the original 60's releases, far more polished/smoother, lacking the raw ""garage band"" sounds of the originals. In one way I'm glad my memory is still working but in another I guess I'll need to buy another CD to get the genuine, original, music I remember and was looking to buy. I don't know who did these tunes but they are not the original 60's releases.................. check the Anthology CD if you're looking for the originals."
1,Listen to the samples first,"From what I see there are alot of disappointed customers of this CD (The Best of TJ & S) but I listen to the samples and thought it was the mix masters or something like that, I'm a big fan of TJ & S but this CD dosen't sound like them for whatever reason. My advice is to listen to the music samples before buying (I did)."
5,Sooo good.,"These chocolates are amazing. I'm a huge fan of white chocolate and these are by far, the best I've ever had. They're so creamy and when you bite into them, they make your mouth water. I highly recommend them as either a special treat or just snack to keep on hand."
5,"Readers will find it an outstanding, diverse selection","It's rare that a review turns to a book that's been on the market for several years, but deserving of repeated, ongoing recommendation is Nelson Bond's Other Worlds Than Ours. It provides a collection of previously uncollected science fiction stories from the 1940s, includes a complete novel, and covers universe to time travel. Readers will find it an outstanding, diverse selection and libraries will find repeat interest in its concepts!"
3,AMY IS THE ONE,"Adorable and sexy Amy Lindsay to my mind steals the show whenever she is cast in a film. I always look forward to seeing her on Cinemax, often in Surrender Cinema films such as Femalien II."
2,Video just looks dated.,"Like the box, this video shows its age with less than vibrant photography and sound."
5,colin bass a bass player who commands the respect of all,i first saw Colin in Edinburgh when he was with Steve Hillage that was when mrH was doing live herald of course one dosent pay a lot of attention to back up guys when Steve gets going. Next time Colin was with Camel holding it all together and adding a certain lustre of his own to the overall sound of the band both vocally and by his noteworthyness In Camel the entire band work as a unit with no apparent front man no ego trippers just the band playing it all for real thankfully this is also true of Colins own work and i would recomend it any one looking for a really good and original set
1,WARNING,"WARNING.....this is not a television, in that it does not receive broadcast television transmissions. In order to do so, you have to purchase and install an additional module. Also, be advised that it does not come with internal speakers nor a stand. Speakers, several hundred dollars? The stand, FWD-42PX2/B, is another $200 or so. IT IS A DISPLAY, NOT A TELEVISION."
1,"Accessories such as stand, speakers and receiver had to be purchased separately. Required a major repair after a few years.","Accessories such as stand, speakers and receiver had to be purchased separately. Required a major repair after a few years that cost $400.+ in addition to the $150. to remove the TV from the wall, the $100. diagnostic fee, and the $100. to re mount the TV. I feel riped off."
2,Broken,"When I received the duck call in the mail, the whole packaging was open and broken apart. Was not happy about that. Atleast the duck call works."
5,Love this watch !,"My watch is awesome! It is classy, water proof, and just what I wanted. Delivered perfectly!"
3,Seiko Women's Watch,"My girlfriend asked for this and loved it, but I was shocked when I first opened it. The watch was much smaller than the Amazon photo suggested, and looked like a toy watch to me."
5,pretty good,"This is good duct tape. I have no complaints. I use it for alot of applications, including sealing around my room air conditioner in my house every summer.good price too."
3,Not bad,"I like their originality with their sound,not many bands that sound like them. The first two songs were definitely good but the other songs weren't so great. So all and all I would give it a 3 out of 5"
2,Batman: Manbat,"This graphic novel had some good art in it at times, but sadly the way they depicted batman didn't appeal to me. The story to this graphice novel was all wrong. Through out the story they made Batman think he was above the law, made him look like a fool, and he went against his morals at one point and time. ... I do not recomend purchasing this graphic novel. If you are a true Batman fan it would just be a waste of your money. Obviously the authors of this book didn't know enough about batman and were more interested in the art than the story."
4,Pretty useful book on cold-formed design,"I have not gone through 1 chapter yet. But the inroduction is already illuminating about aspects of cold-formed members, which are not so clearly explained in other books I've come across. The only setback is it is not in SI units, making it hard to use in places like Singapore."
3,"VERY INFORMATIVE, HARD TO FOLLOW",This book is very informative but it is hard to follow. I guess since it may be my first time touching topics on steel design.
1,Why order this on VHS??? Get the NEW Reissued DVD!,"Hey, I think this is the best program on the market in the last 20 years!Also on Amazon is the DVD Version of this training system -just enter command performance dog training DVD in your search.Does anyone still have a VHS???? LOL!"
2,Didn't know the font would be so tiny,"I have pretty good eye sight and I found the font on this to be challenging.I bought it originally to use in child training my children using the Bible Training set sold at:[...] but I don't think it will work well. It's supposed to be a bible that I can share with my young, beginner reader (and older) children. I think I will have just as much problem reading it as they will.I'm not anexpert, but I would guess the font size to be around a 6 point."
2,Very poor quality product,I was very disappointed when I saw this product. It is very poor quality especially the lid which came already scratched. The jar is quite big and it can take a good amount of sugar but I feel the flip cap is very delicate and unstable and that it's going to fall or break at any time. It is as usual made in China but I would have expected Amazon to choose better quality chinese made items.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
5,Such words of truth,I love this book and hope to read more of his work soon. It is has all the elements of how to lead a good life and follows spiritual principle.
2,Not what I expected,This is a tiny flip book. I didn't think it was very original. I returned it to Amazon.
3,black hawk down,"i found it to be riveting, gut-wrenching, provocative, action-packed, and inspirational."
4,Entertaining and unpredictable,"I can count on the fingers of one hand the gay-themed films I would watch more than once -- most of them are either catty sit-coms stretched out over two insufferable hours, or they're an excuse for badly acted soft-core porn. ""The Adventures of Felix,"" bad title notwithstanding, is a pleasant surprise featuring normal, well-adjusted and attractive (in a real, non-Hollywood way) men. It's a picaresque saga of a young man hitchhiking from Normandy to Marseilles and the encounters he has along the way: some pleasant, some not, but all very real and surprising. There is one preposterous coincidence near the end of the film, but by then you're hooked on the characters' charm. My favorite gay film, with the possible exception of ""Wild Reeds."""
5,A quiet little gem,"The negative reviews about this quiet little gem were penned by those who didn't understand this film... and probably don't enjoy human interest tales. I discovered this delight on DVD - a simple story without any car chases or action sequences. The charismatic and talented Sami Bouajila is outstanding as the title character, adding depth and believability to an already intelligently written character (and script). It's refreshing to see a gay man in a loving relationship without any drama. His HIV is also dealt with intelligently and sensitively. Felix's interaction with the solid supporting cast is a delight to watch across the board. Treat yourself to Felix! Highly recommended!"
5,depth without being 'gay' but rather homosexual,I bought this dvd as a pig in a poke. I loved it. The main character is not only very handsome but has some depth. The movie relates his experiences in life in general and they all add up to making Felix a human being who is in touch with people and not just a homosexual limited to 'gay' circles.I highly recommend the movie
3,Just OK,"If you have travelled around France and enjoy the scenery this movie will take you back and you can appreciate the countryside. Other than that it wasn't that special at all, so if you are expecting a movie to ""wow"" you, skip this one. The picture on the front makes it seem that this could be an interesting movie, but in reality the story line is pretty boring and could have been developed further. The intention was good but those unrealistic encounters along his travels just do not make sense. OK to rent for home viewing - don't waste your money on owning this one."
2,Left Me Flat,"What I had read about the movie made me want to watch it. But, it took three nights to finish it. This one man's journey didn't seem to go anywhere. Somehow, I was waiting for resolution, but didn't get that sense. I didn't find that many redeeming qualities in the Felix. He didn't seem to feel any guilt for car theft, treating a lovelorn teen badly, and generally just being more cynical than I got the sense that he needed to be. As he travels, he encounters 4 different people who supposedly have an influence on him and his journey. But I didn't see him take any of that with him as he went. I guess that I ended up confused about what all the fuss was about. Merely passing through lives doesn't do much for me. Becoming a different person after having encountered others does. Felix didn't really change or grow from his experiences, and I am left with a flat feeling, having not gained anything from the movie either."
1,bad,"This was a horrible book. It had no meaning, no adventure, and litteraly was disgusting. I recommend You not to read this book."
3,Good but not the best,"This CD is good but definitely not the best of La Oreja. If you are a die hard fan get it. Otherwise, save the money, since it will be on your shelf collecting dust."
5,Dusseldorf Mustard,"This mustard is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! The only thing I wish you could sell it in big containers. The mug is great for at home, but I would like to use this mustard for other occasions where I would need to purchase it in a gallon container.( I hope it becomes available).I have tried alot of brands of Dusseldorf Mustard and this is by far the BEST yet!!!!!"
5,Best Mustard,"Not too strong, not too weak without the overly eggy taste of others.I'm a mustard lover. I used to keep 8-12 mustards on hand for different foods. If I had to pick one mustard for everything, this would be it. It will replace at least half my mustard collection."
4,Pretty good to not be from Nintendo Power,"First of all, this guide tries to be funny too much.Second of all, you won't get any maps.That's were the bad stuff ends. This gives a good walk through and points out all areas of interest along with coins and etc to get a score of %100. Though, I'd personally love a map or two, this is worth it if you can get it at a good price."
3,For a class...,Ordered for a class....it had some good info in it. Only skimmed through what was required. A useful book for class.
1,WARNING: Only plays on computers,"This DVD doesn't play on a regular DVD player. Since I've also had the problem with another of this company's DVDs, I assume its a decision and not a defect."
2,LOTS OF MICROFIBER,"YES, PRODUCT IS SOFT.HANDLE IS LONG AND MOP PICKS A LOT OF DUST BUT ALSO LEAVES A LOT OF MICROFIBER WHILE YOU ARE DUSTING.SO I WASHED IT BEFORE USE AND PROBLEM IS SOLVED, BUT NOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE STARS.IT DESERVES 4."
3,Best for Academics,"while the topic is very interesting, this book is an extension of the authors dissertation and funded by a reasearch grant. Please know that about one third of the book is notes and references. Interviews with lamas and experinces would have added to this work."
1,Disappointing 5-page Appendix on Lucid Dreaming,"The writer is not familiar with the international, biological nor historical scope of lucid dreaming. S/he prefers to focus on certain shortcomings found in the works of Kilton Stewart, Stephen LaBerge, and Patricia Garfield. S/he makes no mention of dreamwork techniques."
2,"Big disappointment, but some humor.","I bought this book from Amazon.com and I expected this book to be a guide to places where one might find a restroom available to the public. The book is a collection of semi-humorous drawings about how to urinate in public without being seen or noticed. The book has some mild humorous value, but essentially no value to a vistor to NYC looking for a clean restroom."
4,"Lockspeiser, early expert on Debussy","Composer Edward Lockspeiser, who died at age 67 in 1973, writes of Debussy's life then with illustrated scores takes us through Debussy's songs, piano works, chamber works, orchestral works, choral and dramatic works and finally literary works.Presented from the viewpoint of a musician and composer familiar with Debussy's work and the influences of Debussy's famous musical contemporaries moreso than strictly as a biographer."
2,Nonstick coating problems,"I bought this on Halloween, but I just recently started using it for quick things, like cooking beans, pasta, stir-frying vegetables, and the like. I've used this wok roughly ten or so times so far, and the nonstick coating is already peeling on the sides. I only paid $10 for this so I guess I'll just suck it up and buy a better quality wok, but this was very disappointing."
1,Non-stick coating peeled off easily,I used the pan once and the non-stick coating peeled off in just first use. Used a wooden spoon to cook and a soft scrubber to clean. Very surprised at the quality considering the pan is heavy.
1,Do not buy. Everything sticks.,"This pan was non-stick for less than 10 days. Now it's everything-stick. If you only want to use it for 10 days, this is the pan for you. If you're looking for a pan with a slightly longer life: get something else.I wonder if I can return it."
5,Great little fry pan,"We've only had it a couple of weeks, but it seems to be of good quality, and it a great size for the two of us. Item was shipped/received promptly."
3,Already scratched,"I've only used this a few times and it already has scratches on the bottom of it. I only used wooden spoons when cooking with this, so it's not like a fork digging into it. While it cooks well, I'm just annoyed that the stuff is already starting to scrape off. Glad it was free, because I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Another great David Macaulay book,"The only reason I gave this book 4 stars rather than 5 is that David Macaulay has set the bar so high for himself over the years by writing and illustrating some real masterpieces such as Castle and Cathedral. City is also a great book, just not quite as amazing as others he has written. I bought this for my son, who has always been intrigued by construction projects, but I have also enjoyed it quite a bit."
4,How Did The Romans Do That? Find out how.,"Another of a series of books by this author about architecture and building projects through the ages, City brings the reader face to face with the problems, challenges and triumphs of Roman engineering and construction.The illustrations done in a wonderful pen and ink are as vivid as any photograph could have ever been and may are quite amusing as well as educational and enlightening. The text is explanatory, but not overly detailed and this is by no means a college level treatise on Roman civilization. It is however fun to read and illuminates the practices of the antiquities for younger readers.Adult readers will enjoy the humor depicted in some of the drawings and the text and illustrations are informative for them as well. This may also be a good book for school rooms where much reference is made to the times of the Roman Empire in general study. It's a worthy addition to any library."
5,A must have for Roman history,"I am a huge fan of David Macaulay's historically based line drawings. I found myself drawn into the images and fact-based fictional story. I forgot I borrowed this for my children! After you read the book, you may want to view the PBS video Roman City hosted by Mr. Macaulay. It features footage of ruines as well as animation sequences that follow the story set-up in City. Be sure to include this book in your study of 1st century BC / AD Rome- you won't be disappointed!"
1,looks better on the website.,"I bought a faux fur tree skirt last year from them, and I really liked it. This one looks a little cheap. The background looks more white on the photo but in reality it is kind of a dirty cream. I wish I hadn't bought it. It is definitely not plush. This seller has the worst customer service I have ever seen."
1,An insult to the mob!,This double-parter does nothing but insult Italians-actually stereotype-- those proud of ties to their version of Robin Hood. Whoever produced it deserves a dump in the river.
5,interesting book,"Mancala games are not well known, but these great games deserve more attention. The book has beautiful pictures of these games, games that I would assess as the best abstract strategy games. Beautiful book introducing mancala games."
2,Lovelace Tells All... Years Later,"The late Linda Lovelace explains in her memoir ""Ordeal"" that she was a naive kid who met and was pursued by Chuck Traynor. Once he had her trust he forced her into prostitution and porn; her overwhelming fear of him and what he would do to her (and her family) prevented her from fleeing him although (by her own admission) she had a number of chances to escape over the years.By the end of ""Ordeal,"" I felt dragged through America's hotels and nightclubs, through one freaky party after another to meet every kind of weirdo. Lovelace talks about Hugh Hefner and Sammy Davis Jr. Is her book cathartic or boastful? Is ""Ordeal"" just her means of exploiting her 15 minutes of fame (infamy)? Ultimately, it is a peek into the seamier side of life. Lots of sex, dope, money, mansions, celebrities, etc. At least, that's what I got from it."
1,don't waste your money,It wasn't worth the money. All she seemed to do was blame everyone and didn't accept responsability for her actions.
4,Great entree into the world of journaling and papercrafts,"I've always kept a written journal, but never thought of being creative with them until I saw this book on display at a bookstore. I've sinced thumbed through many other similar books (including Perrella's) and Deihn's are more instructive and interesting. I bought this book before I discovered her other one (specifically for Journaling); I'd recommend the latter if you don't do scrapbooks.She covers dry and wet processes, cutouts, copier transfers, design layout suggestions, altering book coverers, watercolor/gouache/stamping, and more. There's lots of examples for inspiration. This book is pretty complete."
4,JOURNALS,FROM THE PHOTO I EXPECTED TO GET A DIFFERENT KIND OF BOOK. MAYBE ONE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE PHOTO. BUT BESIDES THAT THE BOOK HAS LOTS OF INFORMATION IN IT AND WILL BE VERY USEFUL TO ME.
2,BORING!!,"This book is sooooo dull. I find the pages to be very uninspiring. If you're looking for good ideas for altered books and journals skip this one and try ""Artists Journals and Sketchbooks: Exploring and Creating Personal Pages"" by Lynne Perrella instead."
3,"Great Ideas, Presented Piecemeal","This book tries to do too much and too little at the same time. It touches on a number of ways to embellish pages in books, whether blank or already written on. For those pursuing these kinds of papercrafts, this is a book about ""artist's journals"" and ""altered books.""This book has a smattering good information on each topic, and the ""supplies"" section at the beginning is very well thought out, but the organization of this book is very strange. There are little historical essays, which are very superficial, stuck in among technical how-to sections.Good for a roadmap but not an overview of its subject. It would have to be a lot longer."
3,"one word to put it, decent","i love pete tong, this is not one of his stronger albums, but it will do. alot of house beats and music like that."
1,NO MANTLE....NO MONOPOLY!,THIS IS A RIP-OFF....THERE IS NO MICKEY MANTLE PROPERTY...BUT A KEVIN BROWN PROPERTY...NEED I SAY MORE!
3,"Hot Hunk, OK story","What saves this movie is that it was based on a true story. Joe Penny is a hot italian hunk in it. Much better looking than the real guy. Jenny Robertson is not the sexy siren they want her to be in this but she playes a nut really well. I think it could have been a bit more in depth into the real story, but touches on just enough facts to stay entertaining. For sure worth a few bucks and a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon."
3,Motown's First Superstar Act Was Smokey Robinson & The Miracles,"These Eleven Songs Span from the years 1960 thru 1987 & they take us through three different phases. One of Smokey Robinson & The Miracles which includes the earliest Eight Songs, One of The Miracles which includes One Song Without Smokey and One of Smokey which includes Two Songs as a Solo Artist. My favorites are ""The Tears Of A Clown"", ""Ooh Baby Baby"", ""Love Machine"", ""Just To See Her"" and ""I Second That Emotion"". The Liner Notes explain who sings all Eleven songs. The Sound Quality ranges from good on the newer songs to not so good on the older songs. This CD is not to bad.....If all you want is a Budget Priced CD.FYI: Billy Griffin sang Lead for The Miracles after Smokey went Solo around 1972 and in 1975 ""Love Machine' went all the way to #1 for Billy And The Miracles. Smokey also had Two Top 10 Hits after going Solo with ""Cruisin' and ""Just To See Her"" and all Three are here."
1,Buyer beware!!,"I just bought this CD and am totally disgusted with it. Looks like a great line-up of songs, right? Songs that you may have to purchase two or three albums to have, right? That's what I thought too. The fact of the matter is that the titles contained on this disc are NOT the original version of the Smokey songs we all know and love. This kind of duping of the listening and buying public ought to be stopped. Curses to Motown for their attempts at passing off outakes as the originals. It may be awhile, if ever, that I purchase anything on the Motown label. Do yourself and your pocketbook a favor and stay away from this turkey and for that matter, any of Motown's Millenium Masters series. They are a sham!"
2,Best of Smokey Robinson & The Miracles (20th Century Masters,"If you have no idea of who Smokey Robinson & The Miracles are, this CD has good songs to acquaint yourself with them. For an old 42 year old male like me, they bring back good memories. Lyrics are not included, but they are easy to understand. The quality of the recording is okay. I like reading the historical articles within the CDs in this series (20th Century Masters Millenium Collection). The year of each song's release is noted."
1,Buy The Ultimate Collection Instead,The Ultimate Collection and Anthology are far more complete collections. This will disappoint you.
1,Don't waste your money.,Want to know one of the main reasons why so many people pirate music? This CD is the perfect example. I have a number of albums put out by the folks of this socalled Millennium Collection. There isn't a single one that qualifies as a genuine anthology. 10 or 11 songs is nothing but a scam when you are expected to pay full price. I sincerely wish the worse for the jerks who came up with this idea of cheating the customer for the umteenth time. Get your copy at the library like I did or find it used here on Amazon for under $5 including shipping.
2,workout pants,their were ok exept the Xsmall was still to big. and they shrink once you put them in the dryer.
4,Comfy pants,"I bought 2 different colors of this item in small but when I got them they are a bit big, I had to hem the pants to make it a bit short. Other than that I think it's really comfortable. I wish I know what the logos means though."
2,Wine Rack,"The final product is okay. The assembly directions were very poor. Plus one of the screw holes was stripped so I'm not too certain about the unit's stability at full capacity. Also, the slots for hanging stemmed wine glasses were very small and all different sizes. Most of our wine glasses will not fit."
3,Ups and downs,"This tape looks and feels great. However, as others have noted it does not stick very well. I had to take extra steps to keep the tape on."
2,cloth camo tape,"It did not work for what I bought it for, I had to use glue to make it stick. I had ordered four rolls, I returned three."
3,Good tape [the first time],"I order this for my sears 16 ga and it was great. Cloth tape felt good, didn't feel sticky, camo was as described. I would of gave this a five star review. My only porblm is I ordererd this again an for my H&R .410 and got a different camo pattern. I know I order from the same seller and the same item. Plus the new tap is sticker and like I said a different pattern."
4,Good for wrapping air-soft gun.,Sticks well works well the Cammo is not exactly as I expected but it works. I've found it cheaper at stores but there's plenty of tape and its what i needed.
3,"Good design, not adhesive enough though...","I used 3 rolls of this camo tape to cover my paintball marker, hopper, co2 tank, and mask. Although it looks great, the adhesive side isn't as sticky as I would like it to be, and will begin to peel off if around the ends or any creases in the tape, since it ALSO doesn't have much flex, which I figured I would. I would not recommend it for anything you have that has many contours."
3,nice camo tape,"It is exactly as advertised. I like that it is self-adhesive... won't leave residue on a rifle.It is a little pricey per roll, but you don't need much if you're just covering up shiny stuff on your hunting rig."
3,An okay quality tape,"This tape is extremely not sticky, and will start peeling a few days after use, however the quality of the tape is exceptional, I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you're looking for a decorative tape."
1,hard to install,"If I was working on a flat surface this would be fine, but attempted to wrap a gun or bow is almost impossible with this tape. Too many curves and not enough stretch on the tape. It also frays on the ends when cut and leaves a horribly sticky residue when removed (which was fairly prompt because it looked so bad. Waste of money for weapon wraps."
5,The BEST book EVER,"This book was great...this was my first Maggie Shayne. And the only word that I can think of is PREFECT! I couldn't but the book down, I even considered staying home from work to just finish it. But then I really never wanted it to end."
4,Recommended by Bookbug,"INFINITY is a dark, intense, compelling read that will be of interest to Highlander fans and anyone who enjoys a well-written paranormal romance. Readers will come to care about the characters and the outcome of their sometimes tragic circumstances in this multilayered, bewitching story. ~Bookbug on the Web"
3,Blah,"I was looking forward for this book. However, this book totally disappointed me. Nicodimus was brooding. The emotions and the pain in this book were intense but it was dragged on. I understood this was a very hard book to write and to describe all the pain, frustration and anguish. But I just couldn't be drawn into the story and be charmed by Duncan.It was good story, just not my cup of tea."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first one","I really liked this book. However, I had a hard time being sympathetic to Ariana at first. I didn't like her at all. I also didn't see how any one could. But she gets better! I think the first book in this series is better written. That won't stop me from buying a sequel! I hope to see a book about Nicodemus's companion next. It would be a great read!"
5,What a writer!,As a huge fan of Duncan mcleod's HIGHLANDER shows i was a bit skeptical about this storyline. MY GOD(s)! This book was breathtakingly beautiful. It was full of passion and betrayal so intense I read it straight through the night. The opening poem was sweet and stirring. Nic is a wonderful Highlander. Adrian Paul should play him in the movie version. I loved his strength and vulnerability as an immortal. Arianna grew up quite a bit throughout the book. But even there the author showed how one mans love for a woman and a woman's love for a man could concur all. I am off to buy Eternity...Happy reading!
4,Coundn't stop even if I wanted to...,"Even though I don't believe in the overall philosophy that is clearly being spelled out in this book (forgive the pun), I couldn't help but enjoy the story and be intrigued by the whole idea of immortality and what that state would truly be like. I've read other books about immortals, but this one (and the prequel Eternity) more realistically portrayed the good and bad aspects of living forever. Arianna is a believable heroine and I found myself drawn into her story. Nic was more than just a good looking hunk. He actually had a personality, one we can see clearly because he narrates a lot of the book (nice to see things from the man's point of view). Other than the veiled put downs of Christianity, I loved the book."
1,A great disappointment,This book is a great disappointment from beginning to end. The photography is simply awful and extremly amateurish as are also the prints. A beginning dark room worker ahould be able to turn out better prints after only two or three darkroom lessons. Appatrently the photographer spent little time and energy on thid project. The only redeeming value this book has is as an example of what not to do in photography
3,Great !,I am living in France and I had no problem to order and receive this item.This items is great but there are no inscription on the back.
4,"Good coffee, but...","The quality of the coffee and the speed of delivery were outstanding -- especially because my order was placed during the holiday season. I was a little surprised to find, however, that the two bags contained only 7 ounces of coffee each -- not the way the bags looked in the on-line ad image, but consistent with the relatively small print on the label shown on the image. What I thought was great coffee at a great price turned out to be great coffee at an OK price. While it was my failure to look in detail at the packaging that led to my expectation not being met, more clarity and detail in the text of the ad would have avoided this confusion."
2,Read fine print before buying,I also was surprised to open box and see bags were only 7 oz. What a rip off. I feel that their ads is deliberately misleading and for the money it was a poor choice on my part.
4,Loved the free shipping!,"I must say, I have some other brands I like better and I felt the amount of coffee was a little low, but it tasted good, and the free shipping was very nice. I would buy it again in a pinch, but would not choose it over some other brands I like."
3,Too Pricey,Having been a coffee lover for years...my recall was that Kona was better quality. I would rather go for the Blue Mountain Jamaican Coffee next time for the price.
1,Unwatchable print,"Having seen stills from this movie and being a Lillian Gish (and George Eliot) fan, I was disappointed to find that this DVD-R print is pretty much unwatchable. The titles are pretty much illegible. I'm not sure there is a watchable print available, but I fear the Grapevine print is not it.(The book I recommend for George Eliot completists. It's attempt to reconstruct Florentine dialect makes you wonder if the patois of ""Adam Bede"" wasn't a literary contrivance)."
4,A rare performance of Romola,"Romola is my favorite book by George Eliot - and has not received the attention it deserved - so I was eager to see a screen performance of it when I bought this dvd. I was aware that a 1924 silent movie is unlikely to capture the magic and complexity of a novel or the depth of the characters, and indeed, this is true. The film also omits much of the story in the book, and begins with Savonarola - who only appears later in the novel. But it is still a treat to see such an early interpretation of Romola, and with Lillian Gish. I recommend watching it - and more enthusiastically recommend the novel."
5,EXCELLENT LEADERSHIP BOOK!!!,This book was very useful for me as I didn't know some details and tips I can use in my day to day life activities for both professional and personal aspects.As a global leader we should be able to handle cultural differences and this book shows us how to do it. You will also be able to turn breakdowns into breakthroughs.I personally knew Thomas in Switzerland and he helped me to improve my leadership skills with this book and Communicate or Die.In fact both books helped me to create my own Leadership Breakthrough Project.
5,Culture Clash - Should be required reading for everyone!,"I couldn't put the book down. It's a quick read, yet extremely valuable book. As a result of reading the book, I experienced a greater appreciation and understanding of the many cultural differences that exist in the world today. In addition, the book made me more aware of my obligation as a global citizen to try to understand and better communicate with others. Dr. Zweifel's stories and examples are insightful and extremely helpful. Thank you, Dr. Zweifel for a wonderful book... it has inspired me to global work!"
4,Fun and Loveable,"My girls love, not quite as durable as I had hoped. All that matters is that my girls loved them"
4,groovy glam pony,Purchased item for my daughter for her birthday. She is a huge lover of the polly pocket themes and this added to her collection. A must have for any polly pocket collection
4,You gotta love watching the sexy Kathy Lee Crosby play basketball!,"Most of the movies are pretty damn funny! My Tutor great premise. I loved coach in part because I love basketball, great scene with former NBA great Sidney Wicks! Weekend Pass was kinda cute. Betsy Russell is very sexy in Tomboy! Malibu Beach and Beach girls are cool chill movies. Pom pom girls was a lot better than I expected the one male lead came of age. The Van is a classic I used to watch it on USA up all night! They had that show on fri and sat nights when I was in h.s. I watched Jocks when I was in h.s. and I saw it again recently and it's funny!"
2,too cool for school collection,"the reason only 2 stars, its because it was recorded from old video tape, so all the flaws on the tape get copied to the dvd, they could have copied them from a print and not video tapes, so buyer beware"
5,It's USA Up All Night once again.,"Wow I remember watching these movies in the 80's when I was a kid and what memories I have. The Van was my favorite The Straight Arrowwas a bad van I tell you and to this day I would customize a van like that and cruise all day. along with Jocks, Tomboy, and others makesit Too Cool For School..(wink)"
5,great,"This movie pack was a great deal, some movies I have tried to get before, and that made this value pack even better and the price was right, give it a try"
3,some hard to find movies here,"Overall, the concept is great to have this many movies in one set. However, it would have been nice if they did a little work & cleaned up some of the discs. All in all, it is one way to get some of these movies since it seems that many of them are unavailable individually. I do not know why some movies are out of print, butt if you want to get it, it does provide value."
3,An Uneven Collection,"There are 12 movies in this collection, which costs around $8. So if there are a couple decent movies in the bunch, you've got your money's worth.Surprise! There are several decent movies in this collection (not good, mind you, but decent): The Beach Girls, which features Debra Blee, who looks a bit like Denise Richards but--if such a thing is possible--is even prettier; Hunk, which is a rather ridiculous take on the old deal with the devil motif; My Chauffeur, which stars Deborah Foreman in what should have been a breakout role--she's really funny; and Tomboy with Betsy Russell.Weekend Pass, Malibu Beach, and My Tutor are also watchable if you're in the mood for very light entertainment.The remaining 5 movies have little or nothing to offer."
3,WIDESCREEN ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER,"With this BCI Eclipse widescreen DVD release, you don't get to see Kristi Somers fully nude in the shower room as she appears in the full-frame (VHS) version: in the 1.85:1 format her lower half is cropped from the bottom of the screen, so she appears only topless (from the waist up). For this reason, the DVD should have been presented in full frame."
3,Be warned,"Because these movies are crammed onto so few discs, not all the movies worked. In particular, Coach failed to play on three different DVD players, including the PC drive. This was disappointing for an otherwise reasonably good product at a great price."
3,Tool Cool for School,"The movies were were great old movies I remember from my youth. The quality of two of the movies was very poor. One had constant lines and ""snow"" and noise through most of the movie. The other had many times when the sound was not with the actor's lips. Loved the old movies, but the quality was poor."
4,80's all the way,quite a good collection of 80's movies.some i have never seen before.the best thing is you get my chauffeur.if purchased new as a single dvd $10.00.this is like 19 movies free.
5,Concise and Informative,"An excellent book introducing the origins of historical thought, the changing ideas and methods of history, and the challenges of history in the postmodern era. Also, the introduction provides a great discussion on the importance of studying history. A very understandable and readable book, only 135 pages. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in studying historical philosophy."
4,Evolution of Historical Thought,"Mark Gilderhus' book is a concise look at the evolution of historical research and reporting in a well written, easy to read format which brings life to a less than exciting subject. I was assigned this book for a graduate course on historiography. History and Historians is a good companion to David Fischer's Historians' Fallacies, Davidson and Lytle's After the Fact and Richard Evans' In Defense of History."
2,BORING,"This book is a masterpiece of overstating the obvious. History is biased by whom it is written. Peried. Repeat, ad nauseum. Save your money, you just read the whole book."
2,Seriously?,"This book is surprisingly quite meandering for being only 156 pages including index. I don't understand the reviews I've read of this book. It wasn't particularly well written, interesting to read, or particularly well reasoned. There are a number of statements made in the book that the author does not adequately substantiate. I find his understanding of scientific methodology quite inadequate. How could Greek approaches to history be ""scientific"" when their ""science"" wasn't even scientific? I could see this book being used in a high school history class to give students a very superficial, overly simplified view of history as a discipline, which is typical for most subjects presented in high school. I strongly question the academic rigor of a history department using this book for a graduate level course."
2,I was disappointed,"Yeats compiled these stories from various Irish hillbillies in the 1890s. I am a lover of all things Celtic as well as a lover of folklore, local legends, ghost stories, faerie lore, etc, but surprisingly I just didn't get sucked into this book like I thought I would."
5,Only use these,"Never needed another bib. We have twins and this pretty much catches everything on it or in the pocket and very very easy to clean. When I want a more thorough cleaning, I pop them on the shelf in the dishwasher. Well worth it."
5,Love Bumkins,Love these bibs!!! I will never buy any other bibs. They work so well and hold up to tons of washing. Would definetly reccomend these to anyone.
5,Great Bib,"I had purchased a bumpkins bib with my first child and soon knew I needed more for my second. These are complete lifesavers! I love that they are easily washable and really cover your child's clothing. They are extra long, which is nice when food gets shoved off the tray and onto their pants!"
5,Great,"This is the second Bumkins Waterproof Supersized SuperBib, That I buy . The material is great, easy to clean and Ilike that is long and I love the pocket!"
5,Full coverage,"This thing is great! It's more like an apron than a bib, really. The waterproof fabric texture is more comfortable for baby than something like vinyl would be, and probably more durable too. It's machine washable, and easily wipeable between meals if you don't want to throw it in the machine. Plus this design is gorgeous."
4,Works Well!,"Easy wash; easy dry; holds falling foods and liquid! Have been using it everyday; no more short of cloth bibs!!Only problem so far is that even after several washes, the carrot stain still stays & makes it look ONE year older:("
3,Super Reader,"A man loses his son in a duel, and requests that his daughter help him do something about the man that did it, even though it was in a duel. In this book the Pimpernel is a supporting character, and he is needed later, after the young woman gets herself into trouble with Robespierre's committee.She also learns that the surviving duellist is really not such a bad bloke after all, and, in fact, is rather attractive."
3,Painfully slow start,"eBook downloaded from GutenbergLovely Juliette is compelled by her mad father, the Duc de Marny, to swear vengeance on the man who killed her impulsive, arrogant brother in a duel. During the French Revolution, she denounces his plan to free Marie Antoinette but then realizes she loves him.Painfully slow start, so tedious I almost gave up. And Orczy clearly doesn't think well of men OR women; the women are self-obsessed and manipulative, while the men are simply delusional. In spite of the excessive description (Orczy apparently never heard of the ""show, don't tell"" rule), I was involved by the time I got halfway through, even though I recognized the Scarlet Pimpernel's touch and did some fast skimming of the courtroom scene."
1,COULD NOT EVEN READ THIS BOOK,"EVERY FEW SENTENCES THERE IS ABOX WITH A QUESTION MARK IN IT VERY RANDOM, SOMETIMES AFTER A WORD OR PART OF A SENTENCE IT WAS SO DISCONCERTING I DELETED THE BOOK IMMMEDIATELY"
4,Almost as good as the original,"Although Percy only appears briefly in this book, Marguerite only as imagined by Percy, and Chauvelin not at all, this book is definately worthy of it's predicessor. A young girl is bound by an oath forced on her by a mentally unstable father to avenge the murder of her brother in 1783. Ten years later, her intended victim rescues her from a mob and she secures the oppertunity to denounce her sworn enemy to the Committee of Public Safety, only to discover that she has fallen in love with him. This book only lacks one thing the rest of the series has: Chauvelin."
3,Promises Kept---,"What do you do when your greatest hate becomes your greatest love? Over the body of her dead brother, Juliette Marny's father has made her swear a blood oath. But, upon fulfilling her duties, she realizes all too late that she is in love. Now, she will sacrifice her name and honor to save him from the guillotine.In this novel, Sir Percy is a supporting character who is both ""the savior"" and ""the voice of reason."" Percy argues that idealizing a woman is not, in reality, loving her in the truest sense. ""Fall at the feet of your idol an you wish, but drag her down to your level after that--the only level she should ever reach, that of your heart."""
4,A Really Good Read,"For anyone that has read the other Scarlet Pimpernel books, you must read this one. It's in the same sprit as the others, but it concerns a Citizen-Deputy for Revolutionary France and a daughter of a aristo. If you have read ""The Elusive Pimpernel"", you will know about Juliette Marny. This is her story. Although Sir Percy plays a smaller part in this book than any of the others, since it is concerned with Juliette and Paul, he is there and of course comes to the rescue of these two just in time. It might get off to a little bit of a slow start but it picks up very nicely. Overall, a very good addition to anyone's library that loves the Pimpernel series."
4,"Well done, but wishing for more Percy","I did enjoy this book and it is a wonderful example of Percy's---well, being adorable. But he is a minor character in respect to the book and I find myself wishing there was more of him. There is only a brief mention of Marguerite and perhaps I'm just in love with those two, but I want more."
3,"AVERAGE DANCE TUNE, THAT GETS TIRED FAST.","Sonique the latest from the UK hit Top 10 on Billboard with this single.This song however sounds like everything I have heard in the early 90s, though it has a catchy tune, and good vocals from Sonique, the song wears fast.Also I feel she is copying that other Queen of Soul Tina Turner in her vocals, expressions, and the way she delivers this song. I feel this song really has no originality.Though a good dance song for the clubs, if you are not going out dancing, no reason to buy it for the player....Save your five bucks and go out for a nice lunch in the park."
1,I bought the wrong version..........,"I was totally disappointed (it was my own fault sort of) that I payed good money for this CD and the version I wanted was not even on here!!! I heard the BEST version in Club ""M"" in Dublin, Ireland, I should of asked the DJ (who has always written songs down for me before as everyone knows we are way behind on the music scene over here) but I didnt and I saw this and thought for sure it would be on here and it is not. I know have this and another verson on my ""euphoria"" CD........ the one I really want I probably will never find...... It gives me goosebumps everytime I have heard it.. it is unlike any version on the radio or even what they have played in the clubs."
4,Great Book!,"This book was one of my favorites. It follows the life of Stephen O'Malley, who is trying to deal with the death of Jen. He starts hanging out with Meghan, a girl from his childhood. Then, stolen jewels start turning up in weird places, and somehow, it might be connected to Meghan. Stephen will do almost anything to help her out. Meghan has had a crsh on Stephen since they were kids, but she knows they could never be more because of their beliefs. Could things work out? If you have read the first 5, this is a must read book. Enjoy!"
4,The Rescuer,I am reading The Rescuer now and am almost finished with it. This is the last in a series by the same author. These books are fast and keep you interested enough to want to keep reading so you can find out what happens next. They also have a good message in the story. Dee Henderson as become one of my favorite authors. In fact I just order the next series of three books. Can't wait to get them.
5,Bringing it all home,Dee Henderson's The Rescuer was extremely awesome. It brought love back to the basics. Real love can be life long and that kind of love can rescue the rescuers. Great way to bring it home.
3,The Rescuer (O'Malley) Review,"Not one of Dee Henderson's better reads. I preferred The Guardian and The Negotiator. The story line was a bit old and some of the plots within the story were a bit boring and maybe even far fetched. But I did like Stephen's (the main character) life story. It was different, I bit sad, certainly not glamorous, but I think easy for a lot of middle aged people to relate to."
5,a must buy!!!!!!,"The only thing I have to say about this alblum is that if I had to pick only one out of the thousand plus cd's I own, I would pick this. It is the best thing I have heard in forever!"
3,I was disappointed but you might like it,"I was really looking forward to this CD, but ultimately, I prefer BT's songs when blended in to other works like Tiesto's Searching for Sunrise. It does have some great tracks. But not all the tracks are great. But hey, you might like it... if you want to shell the money... I say the import is simply not worth it. Save a few bucks and buy the US version."
4,Hard to argue with BT,"It *is* a bit uneven but there is quite a bit here to like. Mr. Transeau is a fantastic producer and a skilled musician, and the Atari samples don't hurt, either (at least, not in my book). OTOH, some of the songs (notably Dreaming) come across as a bit hamhanded, I think. The music is beautiful and the production is flawless, but the arrangement might be a bit over the top. Plus, Mr. Transeau is *not* a great singer. (No worries - just 1 track).This would be a great album for somebody new to electronica (pretty eclectic), and it's not a bad listen for the more interested fans of the genre."
3,"Beware, the CD in my book held a trojan!","I like this book (a brand-new copy bought through Amazon) a lot for the reasons others have said, and for the obvious need it fills.But when I tried to open the CD, my antivirus software found ""trojan SHeur.AEPL!!!"" Good grief.I wrote Sybex (the publisher) customer support and they did respond within 24 hours, saying: ""Discussion ThreadResponse (Mark C.) 01/28/2008 10:13 AM""Hi, and thanks for writing.The files on the disc are not usable.""We are sorry for the inconvenience. The files that were missing are provided in the attachment."" (There was no attachment.)This is unprecedented in my experience. But be warned, fellow customers, the CD in your book may hold malicious code. Apparently Sybex will send you the missing content, but that has not reached me yet.Joe Cantrell"
3,MEH!,"I only bought this game for the classic arcade beatem up, Teenage mutant ninja turtles, Turtles in Time, the music from the orginal game was not there, but the music replaced in the game was OK for the most part. The game itself is pretty Repetitive, boring and pretty short, but like I said I was just focus on the arcade classic, only wish they re release a better version of the arcade classic and I don't mean Turtles in time reshelled."
2,"Great Design, Poor Resolution","I purchased the VariZoom Ultimate Kit expecting to be able to use it with my SONY HDV camera. I think that the case and all of the parts are built very well, and very solid. There is no problem with the design of the product. It was easy to set up, and it works. The problem is that the resolution is very poor. The resolution is so poor that you cannot really tell if you are in focus, so you still have to use the viewfinder for focus, which defeats the purpose of having a 7"" LCD on the top of the camera.If you need a 7"" battery operated LCD for setting up a video capture station in the field, or if you simply need to check framing, then I think it will be fine. But I would not plan to replace your viewfinder with this product. For the same money you can purchase a 20"" HDTV to use as a field monitor."
2,"bad, but not the worst","I would actually say this is one of Dragon Lee's better performances, but if Silver Fox wasn't in this, it would be a complete loss. Kind of like ""Demon Strike"" you wait and watch this movie for the end. But the ENTIRE movie blows and just doesn't make any sense. But then again it is a Godfrey Ho movie so it is actually good for him. It does have a sex scene as the other reviewer says and while it was too long and had no place in the movie, I did nto mind. Frontal, backal, you get the idea. And I certainly hope I never have to see a silver fox love scene again. The reason this movie gets a 2 and not a 1 is beacuse Dragon's friend in the movie has some REALLY good moves and both him and Dragon pull off a coupel of sweet kicks at the end. And the end is actually pretty good, even if the movie didn't make any sense up to that point."
4,great item,"have ordered from this company 3 times. always satisfied. Have used the seasonings on fish, burgers, steak and chicken. Great on all."
5,An Entertaining Read with some great insight,"Norm Stamper, much like the late Seattle School Superintendant John Stanford was considered a cutting edge leader in the public sector during the '90s. This was an exciting period in Seattle history and featured the dot com boom and the rise of such businesses as Microsoft, Starbucks and this website.Norm Stampers book offers his views of the problems faced by police departments, many of which were featured in the fictional 2006 Oscar winning movie Crash.Norm present many of his ideas of reform, some of which I can agree with and some of which I cannot.The book is hard to put down once you start reading it and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Profanity,"Previous reviewers have well summarized the book and it's author. One facit of the book not addressed is its content of vulgarity and profanity. I have lived in a Seattle suburb for over 30 years, including the years that Stamper was chief of the Seattle Police Department. The SPD and Stamper were frequently reported in the local news media with no indication that a man of his stature and reputation would use such language.It it understandable that profanity and vulgarity be included in some quotations of police officers and others for the sake of authenticity, but the English language has other words that Stamper could have used to accurately describe policing situations and his own thoughts and feelings. Instead he has demeaned himself and reduced the importance of his book to the law enforcement community and civil leadership."
3,"OK, but hardly original","Former police chief Norman Stamper has one good chapter on the failure of the drug war and the need to decriminalize illegal drugs. Many people have already said this, however,and the rest of the book is nothing great. Yes, most of us already know many cops are racist, corrupt, and sleazy. His extreme left-wing politics become tiresome as the book goes on. We all know that a higher percentage of blacks than whites are in prison and on death row. That's because they commit more crimes. I was somewhat disappointed in this book.P.S. I am not the Jack Davis who was a police chief in Illinois and was busted for extorting drug dealers. It's just a coincidence. Please believe me."
1,Self Serving,"Having a history as a law enforcement officer, I found this book boring and self serving. To coin a cliche, it was all about HIM. I found some of it to be valid, police officers aren't perfect however I was disappointed it was only from the authors's vantage point, and his perception, which was very jaded. I live in the city where he started his career and he was not and is not well respected.It has been the general opinion that he was not a good role model for the police officers of his day. Mr. Stamper should be ashamed of his arrogant attitude and the mark he left with both San Diego and Seattle"
2,Liberal- who happens to be a cop,"Norm Stamper is ""...a card carrying member of the ACLU..."" Seen in that light, his views on decriminalization of drugs, gun control, abortion, race relations, racism and civil rights are hardly enlightening. He is a liberal who happens to be a cop and a police chief. That makes his tone very 'preachy' and self-righteous. He has made many mistakes and uses this book to explain his thought process at the time and what he learned from his mistakes. If you like sinners who have 'seen the light' and now preach to you about it, you'll like this ACLU position paper."
2,"Nice Format, but way too many errors","I've used this book for my Photoshop class for a year. I like the information and tone of this book, but the errors are terrible. There are quite a few lessons you can do along while reading the book, but some of them tell you to open the wrong file on the included CD (the Intro lesson or the Pen Tool lesson), or the file on the CD has been altered so the lesson won't work (the Layers lesson) or don't work at all (the Actions lesson)! There are even simple errors like typos that indicate just plain, sloppy editing.I only stick with it because all my lessons have been written to go with it, and, at this point I think I've found most of the errors (I have compiled a two-page errata). But I'll definitely find a new book when we upgrade to Photoshop 5!"
2,Too Many Errors,"Knowing almost nothing about PhotoShop and being thrifty, I purchased this book mostly because of the price and CD Rom Lessons. However, it quickly became clear that the book is so frustratingly full of errors, it makes it difficult for a novice. The learning curve is greatly increased due to the errors. I never know if no result or a poor result was do to ""operator error"" or book error.For someone with basic knowledge of PhotoShop, this might be a reasonable text, but I would not recommend it for the beginner!"
5,Law of the Fist,"Great condition, shipped quickly - if you are here, you already know what you are looking for so I don't need to say much else."
3,"Use Once, Then Destroy","(3+/4-)A collection of literary horror short stories.Williams has considerable sentence-level talent, which gives his stories mood (to which plot cohesion sometimes becomes secondary)and sophistication. Nearly all are urban and extremely British (or alternative-British) in setting and theme, and that, as well as the unrelenting grimth of his tone, gives the work a certain sameness. Williams can definitely ring the changes on one type of story effectively, but it would be interesting to see if he can do other things as well.Toward the end of the collection a couple of New Weird-ish, alternate apocalyptic stories add interest.This might appeal to readers who like Kathe Koja's earlier work, for example EXTREMITIES."
4,Great album,"Dang, this thing sounds like a female Fugazi, except all the songs are done by Guy Picciotto. The pounding vocals and soft spoken but furious harmonics over chunky rhythm guitars will surely satisfy any post-hardcore/hardcore punk fan. The only reason that this is not a five is that it did nothing to expand the genre. Still a great album."
4,A Classic every Christian,"Whether you have just found Christ or you have been a Christian for a long time, take time to take in the wealth of inspiration & deepen your prayer life."
3,It's ok...,There's some good information on prayer here. I wouldn't use this guide in a ministry but it's one of the better guides.
3,Check out Sensei's Library's Listings first,"This book is ok, but I find the Davies' series much better organized and comprehensive. At any rate, check out the Sensei's Library lists online first. The study section will tell you what you should consider reading given your skill level."
3,Just get this on your PS2,"I really wanted to beat this game, I am a big fan of this type of action RPG(this game runs the same lines as Secret of mana, zelda, and Alundra), but the insane load times on the PSP make it almost impossible for me to enjoy the game.I found myself taking less time to walk across the screen than it took to load it(a real annoyance when trying to find something you missed)the graphics are really good, I loved the cutscenes, and the story was very well written(short but good)Like I said, just get this one for the PS2 and save yourself some money, and stress from obsurdly long load timesthere are plenty of better RPG's to pick up for your PSP"
2,Don't buy it!!! Get the PS2 version.,"The thought of someone paying the astronomical prices being asked for this game is almost too much to bear, so I thought I would give my opinion. The other people that left reviews were being much too nice, the loading times completely ruined the game for me, especially after playing the PS2 version. There is really no reason for the loading to take THAT long, the graphics are very similar to the newer games in the series on PSP, which load fine. Maybe people that use a dial-up modem will have the patience for this, but not people that play video games regularly. I tried to overlook the load times because I like the series so much, but it broke me down about halfway through & I found the ps2 version. That's all!"
5,Hilarious of course,As always It's Always Sunny is hilarious. I could watch these episodes over and over and get a laugh every time.
5,Always Sunny,"I love the show and couldn't wait to get it as soon as it came out on DVD. I was pleased that it shipped even before the release date, and it is in perfect condition!"
4,"Good, but not as good as the first 2 seasons","I loved the first 2 seasons of this show. While I continue to like this series, it seems that the characters are starting to trend towards an unnecessary level of silliness. The topics and writing continue to be funny, so I don't quite understand why the acting has to go to such absurd extremes."
5,crcklvr,"Tears streaming down my face, fall off the couch, beer through the nose, crude, rude HI-LARITY! If you ain't watching this, get out of your moms basement, put down the Playstation controller and glue your orbs to FX. This isn't feel good television, it isn't reality about dancing, surviving, singing or making over homes. It's comedy; mainlined straight to your funny bone with a chaser of guilt. Couldn't be more pure."
5,Awesome,We thoroughly enjoyed the continuing antics of the 5 deeply flawed characters. Episodes move along smartly and are original and fresh.
5,It's Always Funny In My Mind,These guys've notched the comedy pole up pretty high there. I can watch these blokes again and again and still be knees up laughing every time at what this crew get up to. I think I must be a bit deranged.
3,Disappointing third season,"Given the positive reviews and the first two seasons of this show, I was really excited about the third season coming out. Sadly, I think the show has lost a lot of what made it great. Seasons 1 and 2 were certainly outlandish, but (mostly) believable. The humor hinged on the character interactions and performances. Season 3 trades the sharp wit of seasons 1 and 2 for things like not funny stereotyped Koreans and unrealistic acid trips. Frank's character moves from being a sadistic/vitriolic/cowardly sob to nothing more than a clown.So sad, hopefully they'll get back on track for the next season."
3,Love the show but.....,"1 Star for the product, 5 stars for the show.The idea that there are only 2 commentaries for 15 episodes is weird. You do know that everyone can watch uncut Season 3 Sunny episodes on Hulu.com right? I bought the Season 1 and 2 DVD and frankly a lot of what I bought ended up on the web anyway for free. You'd think that the Sunny cast would do a commentary on every episode a la the Simpsons or Family Guy and the fact that there are only 2 commentaries makes me not want to buy this DVD.I'd love to give these guys money but not for a product that I can get for free."
5,A masterpiece,"Honestly, this is the funniest show in the history of television. You can check my history, I don't shill for anything but I needed to let people know how great this show is.Buy the first two seasons as well as the humor builds on itself and the characters get better with every interaction. Charlie is one of the best characters of all time and I dare you to spend an entire episode just watching characters react to dialogue they aren't even involved in without laughing.I bought copies of seasons 1 and 2 to give as a gift, and because I couldn't wait purchased digital copies of all of season 3. I will also be buying this because the bonus commentary is worth the money by itself, and really, I feel like I owe these guys for all of the enjoyment I've received from this show.Stop reading, add it to your cart, all the laughter will probably add a year onto your life."
3,"Some amusement, great ensemble cast, script could have used more polish","Based on the ensemble cast I would have predicted this film to be hilarious. The mocumentary style has been well established and I would have thought poker would make at least as lively a subject as, say dog shows, folk music, or small-town theater, but, and it's a big but..the writing just wasn't there. Camera work, acting, sets...all great...and there were a few funny situations..but mainly the characters weren't allowed to develop their flaws into comic proportions. I would rate this as a rental for a group of friends who enjoy poker, but not a purchase."
2,Didn't connect,"If there were two subjects just ripe for satirical take-down, it would be Las Vegas and poker. (One could argue that Las Vegas is in a continuous state of self-satire, and that the current incarnation of poker is a dumbed-down apology for the noble game, but never mind.) And ""The Grand"" includes many zingers at both subjects, both scripted and nicely improvised. But after about half an hour, I caught myself looking at my watch, and I realized that I wasn't sure what the film was really all about. I think that good satire needs a central character with whom you either empathize (think Graham Chapman in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian""), or squirm (e.g. Ricky Gervais in ""The Office""). Like an extended SNL episode, ""The Grand"" has lots of jokes, but ultimately no point. And that's a shame."
2,A few laugh out loud moments but kind of drags,"This movie reminded me of one long episode of ""Curb your enthusiasm"".Possibly because Larry David's TV wife plays a big part.I thought it might not be that good when I heard Ray Romano was in it, but his part as her husband is pretty funny.I never really got caught up in the Poker craze...so it's really not all that interesting to me. The television commentary jokes were lame, and have been overdone in so many other movies like this.I enjoyed Woody's role, but again, only in flashes.Basically it's a weak story line, based around a few funny one liners, with a lot of cameos from some marginal TV actors. (Gabe Kaplan, Lenny from Laverne & Shirley, and George from Seinfeld)Good for a few laughs...but I would fold on this."
1,What A Loser,"The less said about this dog of a movie, the better. It ate up 104 minutes of my life. That is so unfair. It has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Under the Special Features Section I noticed that there are ""Alternative Endings"" and ""Deleted Scenes"" listed. I can't imagine what scenes were deleted. I can only say that not eough were.I always liked watching Woody Harrelson on ""Cheers,"" as the dumb bartender who got off good one-liners. He falls flat on his face here, however, as the gambler with 74 wives. If one of those is the runaway bride from the Atlanta area-- the photograph looks just like her with that wide-eyed stare-- then that is mildly amusing. But all the king's horses and all the king's men can't save this scrambled egg of a movie.Walk your dog, play with your cat or treat youself to a good chocolate dessert but avoid this film at all costs unless you are certain you will live to see a hundred and have precious time to waste."
2,"Mediocre at best, again",It comes close to being a waste of resources. A lot of plastic was used unnecessarily to do this movie. Slow and boring are a bit understated but I know of no words that sound worse or more informative. The acting was stiff and almost unnatural. It is a shame that some folks are going to think that this is the way to play polka. Perhaps this is the way to dance the polka but certainly not the way to play it. This was a movie that you did not push the pause button. You simply went to the fridge to get your icecream and come back when you were ready but hoping that the movie would be over and low and behold - it was not.
3,A Safe Bet for Laughs,"The secret behind any good poker player is ambition -- elevating the poor hand and turning it into a winner -- and THE GRAND, as a film, gives it a good shot. With plenty of recognizable faces (Woody Harrelson, Dennis Farina, Michael McKean just to name a few), the film plays out like a bad poker hand -- through a series of awkward bluffs -- and ends up coming off much better than luck or skill probably intended or deserved, especially for fans of any of these types of films. For harmless laughs, it's a safe bet. The grand problem with THE GRAND is that the narrative never quite figures out what it wants to be: a mockumentary, a reality-show spoof, or a traditional big screen comedy. The film boasts equal parts of each type of film, and, unfortunately, never mesh into a fully formed whole."
3,Lochness was much better...,"This film had some funny moments - hit and miss, but mostly miss. The last 1/2 hour of the celebrity tournament goes on way too long - it's like they were looking for filler to make it a 90 minute release. Some hilarious moments - Chris Parnell, Werner Herzog, but overall a bit of a dud. I guess that's why limited theatrical release didn't go national. You will also lose some interest if you don't know how to play poker.Rent ""Incident at Lochness"" for a more hilarious mockumentary."
2,"dull, unfunny comedy","""The Grand"" is a mockumentary about six internet poker players who gather in Las Vegas for a $10 million, winner-take-all tournament.A game, eclectic cast - Woody Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Chris Parnell, Ray Romano, Werner Herzog, Gabe Kaplan - struggles with a mediocre script that, in tone as well as in style, steals clumsily from all those far superior Christopher Guest movies like ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind."" In the case of ""The Grand,"" the humor is largely lacking, as each eccentric character plays out his little assigned shtick over and over and over again.As executed by writer/director Zak Penn, the poker scenes are particularly languid and lifeless and utterly incomprehensible to any non-poker players who may happen to be a part of the audience."
3,The Grand,"Well, this film has no sacred area which makes it funny and mockerary to all insitutions. It is one of those no hidden meanings flicks (I seen none) however it is meant for a chuckle or two. I'm not sure, but I would say it is like Mel Brooks ""It's a Mad Mad World"" (from the60's) with an updated theme. Great all star cast here folks.Hope this helps."
4,Poker Playing Parody,"This was a funny, well-written satire of those who populate the poker championship world. Such people are often flamboyant odd balls, willing to do almost anything to have the edge over the competition. This movie makes you feel like you know them up close, and yet are sympathetic to their oddities.The cast of the Grand (the name of the champioship) is an impressive group of well-known comedians and character actors, including Ray Romano and Jason Alexander, among many others. It is fast paced and interesting.Whether you are a poker player or not, this movie is worth seeing for the outstanding performances and good script."
3,Ok,Its ok but expected more out of this. Think the characters that I found amusing had very little in the movie. Maybe thats why they were amusing. Ok overall
2,Not very entertaining,"I usually enjoy ensemble comedies, but not this one. It started out hopeful with Woody Harrelson really doing some funny lines as a recovering addict (such a bad addict he LIVES at a drug rehab full time), who, while on a binge, takes out a loan on his grandfather's casino with a land developer (Micheal McKean). Woody checks out of rehab to join a poker game called "" The Grand"", in hopes of paying off the loan and getting his casino back. The movie just goes down in a BORING ball of flames at this time. I had to FORCE myself to finish watching it. I won't give away the ending, but it ended okay in a BORING way.I don't recommend this comedy, which is sad, because there are some really good actors in this movie. Just not an entertaining movie."
1,The Grand,"A cast of well known actors stars in a mockumentary of poker. If you enjoy Christopher Guests work, then i'd avoid this movie at all cost. It's not funny and very boring. I wanted to turn it off after forty five minutes but stuck thru the end. Avoid at all cost."
4,Timely action thriller!,"Jae Gordon has written a fast paced action thriller that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat - right up to the stunning climax. Full of twists and turns, the story unfolds like a complex origami sculpture! It kept me guessing the whole time...and, of course, I was wrong! I found the scenes to be rich and vibrant; and filled with personal observations that added depth and realism to the story. I also liked that the chapters were fast paced and compelling, I could not put the book down! I truly enjoyed the experience and I highly recommend it. I can hardly wait for the next book!"
3,The Original Energy Drink,"If you like Red Bull you'll like this -- but since I don't, yeah. This basically tastes like Sprite or 7 up, but it's orange in color, and is a bit more sour, and also less sugary. It's made in China too, which I find pretty weird."
5,Indispensible. Don't leave home without it.,"We first bought this book in 1983 when we went crazy. We sold all our possessions, bought a Jeep, loaded our 4 year old son up and headed for Mexico. We used this book as a dictionary, etiquette primer, cookbook, and shear entertainment. It filled many candlelite (no electricity) evenings in our cabin on the beach. Now 14 years later we still have the same book and still read it often. It reflects true situations (often hilarious)in real Mexico, far from the tourist infested psuedo-American playgrounds as well as giving many helpful hints (how to make a clothes washer out of a van)on how to survive in Mexico on practically nothing"
4,Great software for troubleshooting,"I only give it 4 stars because the CDs in the package were blank for some reason. Using my serial number, Prosoft gave me a way to download the image. But I'd expect the product to ship with properly burned discs since the bootable discs are an important part of recovery."
1,Garbage...doesen't even work or do anything....and over priced,"I downloaded this program and bought it because no features work unless you buy this crap.....Big mistake. All it did was screw up my system disc's and every feature failed when ran....useless garbage and for 99 dollars!!?!?!? Disc utility does the same exact things but actually fixes your disc errors not just tells you you have them and fails at every attempt to fix them.Avoid like the plague......I always keep my computers running top shape using a varity of programs and apps so I thought I would try this...don't make the same mistake. I had to erase a HD with no errors on it after scanning with this crap product, luckly disc utility fixed it and I had it backed up on another drive.."
3,Got an older version ...surprise to me,"I purchased drive Genius.. It works.Then, about 10 days later, I found out that a newer version (2.1 ??) is available. An upgrade to the current version 2.0. I think I got 1.5.. Well it works anyhow .."
2,Implausible,"Mansfield is usually a very dependable Regency writer; however, while the premise is quite interesting (younger man/older woman), she misses the mark with this book. The characters just aren't very appealing, and their motivation is very thin.One of the hallmarks of a Regency novel (ala the modern mistress of the genre, Georgette Heyer, and her predecessor, Jane Austen) is that it be a comedy of manners; if one must give someone a set down, it is done in the most deliciously polite way. I found the behavior of both protagonists, especially the heroine, to be extraordinarily boorish. Worse, there is no basis for their attraction to each other, and everything that proceeds from there simply doesn't track.In short, save your time and money on this one."
4,BOBBY BRADFORD & THE JOHN CARTER QUARTET WERE ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S COMPANY...AND THE CROWD WAS ENJOYING THEM!,This is Very Serious Straight Ahead Jazz! Some may even be a little to abstract sounding. This album is NOT for beginners. All of the cuts are in Extended Form as you would expect in a 'Live' setting. Oh! And this compact Disc don't come cheap...If you're lucky enough to find one you're gonna pay a pretty thick price.
5,A TRUE CLASSIC,"I got a hold of a vinyl copy of this brilliant album some 10 years ago and have been playing it consistently ever since. One can only wonder why it took so long for somebody to pick it up for re-release. Anyway, if you like smooth 70's soul and you're serious about your music, you can't be without this one. It's that good - up there with the Sam Dees and Leroy Hutsons of this world. Many sought-after obscure albums have only one or a few worthwhile tracks. This one is packed with gems and the whole ting really comes together the way a good album should. Great vocals, brilliant production, great tunes and even great lyrics. An all-time top 5 soul thing for me, no question about it. In other words, if you haven't listened to this album, you don't really know how good 70's soul can be. Nuff said."
5,leave your shoes and complexes at the door...what door!? :),"easy read (you'll still be rereading it in your subconscious, in your future dreams, etc).cantankerous skeptics, this is fiber your bowels can't handle.laugh and hang ten.:)"
1,Exploitation by this author-don't waste your money on this tripe.,"What a joke. Taking a serious subject like this and reducing it to cartoon charachter ridiculous dialogue and talking about it like it's lightweight comedy is just horribly disrespectful and exploitative, to say the least. In my opinion, this ""author"" (using the term very loosely here) just wants you to join his organization, and I would bet you sending in some money to support his cause is involved. What a con artist approach to a sacred subject. Don't waste your money. The writing isn't even respectably done. Sounds like a used car salesman having a good time listening to himself tell lies. I would give this no stars if possible."
1,waste of money,"I don't know where this guy gets off. But his entire rant about Paco Votan(who the freak is this guy) and his self-declared state of being a prophet is enough to make any sane person laugh himself to tears. The book has a nice cover though and his map of the universe bears a strikingly close resemblance to the Qabalah's Tree of Life. I would like to point out that it might be useful to UFO worshippers that waste all of thier free time sitting around the Nevada desert, you can cover your face while you sunbathe. The only unfunny thing about it was that I actually paid money for it."
3,You do or you don't,"I have been collecting every renaissance cd ever released and it was with great dissapointment that I had to take my latest buy back to the record store from which it came. It's not that the disc's are all that bad it'd just no way near to the absolute and never faltering mix and music standard that we come to expect from each and every Renaissance disc released so far. What makes it worse is that it's been put in as the second release in the new ""Master's"" series, this is in no way a Masters worthy compilation, yet rather more suited to a Gatecrasher or Ministry of Sound mix. So if you're looking to try out the true Renaissance sound then don't look here. Yet if you're used to the more typical clubbing sound with a more classy twist then this might be just what you're looking for. I'll leave it at that."
1,Why did I read this book?,"This book is about a boy a dog and Chaplin Stuart. The boy is stuck in the middle of a war, the dog is glorified to the level of sainthood, and Chaplin Stuart always knows the right thing to say and how to keep the book corny. This book tries to present life lessons for children to live by in a very unoriginal way. If you want to teach your kids something read them the Bible not Dog Jack."
3,Ripped in the first hour,"I was looking forward to sturdier-than-usual tights, and they seemed tough, but our 2-year-old daughter had a hole on the back of her knee within the first hour (and we were at a wedding, so it's not like she was climbing around . . .). Disappointing, particularly for the price."
2,Tom Brady was DOA,Ordered as a gift. Everything looked good but the audio feature didn't work. Batteries were corroded also. Pez dispensing part worked well. Shame as is a cute idea.
2,From a big Annie fan,"I was really let down when I bought this album. Annie's lyrics are still great, and her voice is still amazing, but somehow the songs on this album didn't bring me in like most of the tracks on Diva. I enjoy Pavement Cracks. It almost sounds like a leftover Eurythmics track, if one chooses to see the distinction between the material from Eurythmics and the material of Lennox solo. The word ""boring"" may be a bit too harsh to describe my feelings about ""Bare"", but it certainly is not an album I will listen to excessively."
5,"If this album doesn't win a Grammy, there is no justice","If this album gets as little airplay as the last Eurythmics album, ""Peace,"" or Peter Gabriel's ""Up,"" it will prove to me beyond the shadow of a doubt that radio doesn't care about good music anymore.Like many of the other reviewers, I agree that this is Annie's best work yet. There's not a bad song on the album, and it is DEEP. It is also layered. Annie's voice is layered over Annie's voice which is layered over exquisite instrumentation.I've played the album all the way through at least 20 times since buying it a few days ago. Not only is it not ""getting old,"" I want to keep playing it until I understand and hear ALL of the nuances.Buy this. Buy it now. You won't regret it unless you're some kind of shallow heathen."
5,Annie Lenox Bares All.,"Annie Lenox once again proves she has it all. There are singers, performers, and writers. A few are great at one. Rarely someone is great at all three. Annie Lenox is one of those people. Then she takes it beyond to the rarest of all catagories - Art. This confirms her as the contemporay ""pop"" artist of our time. Diva is still the best ""pop"" album in the last ten years. This album confirms that was not just a fluke. She does what is almost never done in contemporary music - She communicates from the soul. These songs will reach everyone because they come from truth. Bravo Annie. A must for every music lovers collection."
4,Great music,This CD really showcases Annie Lennox's voice. I have always been a fan of hers nd this CD did not dissapoint me.
5,Annie Lennox's best work ever,"As a big fan of the Eurythmics, I was horribly disappointed when they broke up and felt that ""Diva"" was a bit of a step backward for the most entertaining woman in Rock. But ""Bare"" is quite simply a masterpiece. Oddly enough I believe the weakest track on the CD is the opening track ""A Thousand Beautiful Things"" (and it's not half bad). It's all uphill from there though. Personal favorites are ""The saddest song..."", and ""oh God"". I mentioned that she is the Most entertaining woman in rock. If you ever saw the Eurythmics live you would certainly agree. Her show for Bare was different but every bit as mind blowing. I can't wait to see where she goes from here."
2,Time changes a lot,"Every Annie Lennox CD has had to grow on me. Her first two solo releases turned out to be some of my all time favorites. Sadly, I just can't get into this CD. It is almost painful to place it in my CD player.I still have so much respect for Annie Lennox that I purchased the European edition as well as the US edition (exactly the same, except different record labels).I hope that Annie Lennox is around for a long time. Next time I might be more excited if the music is in a different style."
2,Excess Baggage,"There is something very contrived and artificial about this record. I don't question the sincerity of Annie's emotions, or the pain she has experienced, but she has failed to translate that into a deeply felt organic musical statement along the lines of Joni Mitchell's Blue. This album seems to suffer from its own baggage, and is too self aware and self-conscious for its own good. Does she have to expound on the themes that pervade the album in the liner notes. It all comes off as so self-important. Annie, can't you just let the music speak for itself? And therein lies the tale: the music just isn't that great."
2,"Hey Annie, Crack a Smile!!!","Annie looks and sounds so sad and depressed on this album, like she lost her best friend. I want to paint to her a happy face and tell her to keep her chin up, if only for a little while. Hun, life isn't all that bad. Crack a smile. You'll feel so much better"
2,Now THIS Is Like Walking On Broken Glass,"Annie Lennox has never been one for emotional singing - her vocals tend to be very dry and mechanical - seemingly too intentionally technical. But that served well enough when you got the hooks, and when with Eurythmics, hooks she never lacked. Her 2 solo projects prior to Bare attested to her longevity, if not tenacity. 'Diva' wanted to be a masterpiece, but failed to be so on her vocal prowess alone, and pined for Dave Stewart to bring the riff. Her covers album, 'Medusa' never achieved her desire to be a soul interpreter to be reckoned with. So, 8 years later, newly divorced and obviously in pain, she releases a dull litany of raw emotion. Melodies meander, lyrics muddled. The point is well taken, but maybe counseling would have been better suited than the ponderous banalities diffused here. My grade: C+"
2,Who needs sleeping pills?,Lyrics and singing are good. The music is drab and just doesn't fit. I had to rip the thing out of the CD player by track #8 just so I wouldn't fall asleep from boredom on the way home from work. I'll give it a few more tries. Maybe when I have trouble falling to sleep.
1,Dull,"Very dull. I just cannot get into this CD. Her previous work andmusic had much more to it and was more jazzed up. This is so mellow that you want to go to sleep.I would not recommend this CD unless you like very dull, slow paced music."
5,She's still got it...,"In a business as daunting as the recording industry, it's wonderful to realize the staying power and innate talent of this amazing artist. This CD is as listenable, evocative and haunting as anything she's ever done and ranks among the ""must-have's"" for your music library. Here's hoping she will continue to display this kind of staying power for decades to come!"
5,Better than Diva,It's a very beautiful work of art. Her voice takes more chances going for the extra half-step in tone that is needed. Most songs are sad in lyric form but juxtaposed to the music the songs can lift you up. Buy it if you like her.
5,The Hurting Time,"Although Bare is comprised of several engaging and meaningful songs, the only real stunner here, and indeed the foundation of the album, is ""The Hurting Time."" This song really sneaks up on the listener unawares, growing deeper and more powerful with each repeated listen. And I loved the barely audible, electronic dubbed lyric ""Gotta get used to it"" that acts as a sort of climax to the song, and pinpoints the self-resignation that we all have to face at one point or another. You nailed Annie. Great job."
2,Disappointed,"I've been a fan of Annie for a long time and was disappointed in Bare overall. I only liked one track and this was the up tempo, Bitter Pill. The faster material in the past was simply better. For instance, it would be great to see a dance remix on final album vs. an extended single. I have great respect for Annie and was impressed that she did the album cover without airbrushing. Annie is proud of her age and not trying to be something she's not. I'm still a fan. My hope is the next album will go a different direction and be more upbeat."
2,Disappointed fan,"I was SO looking forward to Annie's new CD but I was incredibly disappointed with Bare. Musically, it sounds very much like all of her other solo work. Lyrically, it's pain and angst all the way. After a couple of songs I wanted to say ""get over it Annie, spare us the details, we've all been there"". Overall it's just a boring CD. As another reviewer said ""bring back the Eurythmics"" or at least get a different producer, get a renewed outlook on life, try writing in a different style. Or just put your incredibly beautiful voice to work on some great covers...how about some great old standards or jazz. Please, Annie, something different next time."
5,Annie's still got her gun,"A fabulously mature album that reflects life, love and loss.Counteractive beats give each song it's own pace. The song over a song, 'Honestly' was a gift, a powerful undertone with almost manic over the top of lyrics makes this song a prime example of why Annie never needed to be part of a band, she can sing front row and centre and carry herself well.'Pavement cracks' is another example of how people try to find love in the strangest of places.'Saddest song' is maybe the most deeply upsetting song I have ever heard her sing and she did it masterfully. You feel it.It's fair to say the album reflects maturity and a sharpened talent, the songs themselves give her powerful voice the ideal platform to raise with 'Erased' and lower with 'Pavement cracks'Beautiful album - much treasured."
5,Wow!,"I saw Annie in Boulder in April and was blown away. The reviewer who said she's too old obviously has never seenher perform live. How can anyone compare a lightweight like Kylie Minogue to a true rock legend/goddess like Annie?This new album is astounding. So much better than I hopedfor. She's toned down the hard-edged, aggressive quality in in her voice from the past. The result is a voice that is everybit as strong and powerful, yet clearer, the notes more pureand resonant with a deep, intense blue-sy feel.The lyrics are amazing. I'm not talking about catchy hooksbut well-written, personal, intelligent verses that you rememberas soon as you hear them. Medusa was a tribute to artists andsongs she loved. This album is a monument to her own song-writing abilities.Bravo, Annie, well done. I hate that you made us wait so longfor this, but it was absolutely worth it! Rumor has it a live album is to follow??? Please say it's true!!"
4,Very well crafted pop from a unique voice in music,"Excellent! This album spans the gamut from synthy pop rock to Motown like soul. The production value is top-notch with many layered vocals combining in perfect harmony. I highly recommend this CD. Though not as poetic as DIVA, this album should certainly not be missed from anyone interested in hearing pop music with substance. ""Honesty,"" ""Pavement Cracks,"" and ""1000 Beautiful things"" are highlights but the rest of the songs are right up there in terms of their musical quality. Ms. Lennox, you've done it again!"
4,classic annie lennox,"If you are a big fan of Annie Lennox (like I am), you will not be disappointed by ""Bare"". Full of emotion, and Annie's terrific voice."
3,Worth Buy for Diehards,"I must say I'm a little bit disappointed at Lennox's latest solo effort. Don't get me wrong but this album has begun to show her downhill side to keep up those ever impressive melodies and tunes and mood from her early solo years - DIVA .A THOUSAND BEAUTIFUL THINGS is a great opener and probably owes it to the new producer for Lennox, Andy Wright (who co-produce most songs for Simply Red in recent years). You'll love HURTING TIMES instantly at one or two play, it's typical Lennox ballad at best. But it is WONDERFUL that stay in your head ultimately, Lennox sang it so casually yet with a powerful voice that reach and touch you effortlessly. It is my favorite of all tracks here.The rest of the tracks are, frankly, not impressive. Unlike DIVA, BARE does not collect each uniquely crafted song and title that still makes you croon and hum familiarly along over years.However, this album is still worth a buy if you're a diehard for Lennox's beautifully written love songs."
3,"Annie, what happened?","Annie's lyrics are still great and her voice is still amazing, but somehow the songs on this album don't bring you in like most of the tracks on Diva. Pavement Cracks is the best track. It almost sounds like a leftover Eurythmics track, if one chooses to see the distinction between the material from Eurythmics and the material of solo Lennox. The word ""boring"" may be a bit too harsh to describe ""Bare"", but it certainly will not leave the mark of Lennox's prior albums."
3,There are great tracks on this good album,"As long as I have followed Annie, this is the album that carries the most disappointment for me. There are great tracks intertwined with disappointing ones. ""Loneliness,"" for instance, could have been better, but Steve Lipson's production drowns out her voice almost completely at times. ""The Hurting Time"" sounds beautiful, but some of the lyrics are downright banal: ""To everything there is a purpose, to every blade of grass and every leaf on every tree..."" Other songs are much stronger, like ""Erased"" and ""The Saddest Song I've Got,"" which really needs to grow on you before you appreciate it. ""Bitter Pill"" and ""Wonderful"" are fun enough to ignore some of the lyric clich?s. Annie sounds her best on this album, it is just a shame her heartbreak (separation from her daughters' father) clouded her songwriting, making them standard love and breakup song fodder."
3,Beautiful Music: Negative and Depressing Lyrics,"Annie Lennox produces a beautiful collection of terribly depressing music. While this is great artistry, it will likely receive little airplay by me. What is so horrible that has happened to Ms Lennox? I feel bad for her, bad must reject the negativity and sadness of this album."
5,Chillout supreme,"Annie's voice is without question one of the best and most enduring in the music world.Her third solo offering finds her delivering lush and downtempo tunes once again complete with haunting melodies and Steve Lipson's immaculate production.Almost every track here stands out on it's own.1000 Beautiful Things,Pavement Cracks,The Hurting Time,Bitter Pill,The Saddest Song and Erased are beyond perfection.Bare simply takes to new heights were Diva And Medusa left off.If there's one woman who can give a song the warmth and chilling effect at the same time,then it's Annie."
5,Greatness,"There are three songs in a row just past the mid point of this cd that absolutely blow me away. ""Lonliness"" ""Saddest Song"" and ""Erased"" are simply phenomenal in their emotional impact. An artist who BARES her soul like this is only a bummer when it sounds like they're trying to make a downbeat statement. Annie's not doing that here. Like Springsteen and Dylan, she's just expressing what she knows and sometimes that's the sad reality of life. This is a terrific collection of songs that have dynamics and relevancy in a world of false pop icons. You'll never see Annie on the cover of a tabloid but she will be remembered as a star of this musical era long after we're all gone."
5,"excellent, excellent, excellent!","A very very well produced album. Her music is very deep emotionally, her heart and soul is poured into her singing which made it so real and sophisticated. what an incredible voice, what an incredible album! you won't regret buying it, even though the album only has 11 songs.enjoy!"
5,Annie Lennox surpasses herself,"We have happily come to expect outstanding, inspired music from Annie Lennox but with ""Bare"" she has excelled herself. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this CD arguably contains her best work so far. Every composition and all of the lyrics are consistently brilliant, impressive creations, but of course it is Annie Lennox's amazing voice that not only gives life to each composition but takes them to a level of luminosity that is only very rarely seen in today's superficial music industry.The music is engineered to exacting, superior standards, backup vocals are stunning, and every song could be described as dazzling, with ""pavement cracks"", ""wonderful"", ""loneliness"" and ""erased"" in particular standing out.""Bare"" is one of those rare, extraordinary CDs that are equally spectacular on the 1st or the 200th listening."
5,A Triumph.,"Somehow, Annie Lennox wraps up all the gooey, jagged pain I've ever felt in one beautiful package. She captures all the anguish, helplessness, and bitter-sweetness that come with a love lost.I tend to use music as a tool, and this CD helps me work through the hardest parts of regret and mourning, and regain dignity and confidence.She's clearly touching on experiences in her own life, and that's what makes this work so moving. It is the sincere and powerful voice of a real person.Thanks Annie."
4,"Really useful, but does it come in a bigger size?","Up until now I'd been using two tools to maintain my piercing - cotton buds, and a medicated lubricating gel that did a good job but left behind a flakey residue when it dried. Also I travel a lot, and in my toilet bag my cotton buds invariably get fluffy. Dr Piercing's Aftercare is super handy, with it's own little carry box (so my buds don't fluff), and the medication in the swabs keeps my piercing in good condition without leaving behind any residue. It also means I only need to take one product around with me when I travel, which is great, and the medicated-bud thing means its less messy than using a gel-based product.The only negative is that if you're someone fairly active, 36 swabs per pack won't get you very far. I gym regularly so often swab twice a day, which means I get through a pack quite quickly."
5,Works,Very convenient for traveling. Compact and easy to carry around. Clever design for application and surprised that it doesn't leak. Can survive airplane rides. Only caveat is that I only use them for traveling and use saline wash when at home.
5,Great Product!,"Being a California resident, I keep this in my emergency preparedness first-aid kit. In the event of a Katrina-like disaster, medical help will not be available. Be sure to research how they are used and best practices to not create air pockets or infection."
5,"a ""must have"" for the medicine cabinet","Exactly what I was looking for! Having a nurse in the family, as well as these suture kits, are a welcome assurance in case they're ever needed."
1,Not worth the money,Last time I left a comment the seller erased it. Makes me not trust Amazon if the seller can just erase your comment!The reason I am giving it a 1 star is because of the price. The price was $3 something and the shipping was $6 something making the total purchase $9.79. The shipping makes the price of this product too expensive for what you are getting.
3,Bit overpriced,"Good suture but cheaper eleswhere, if you buy in bulk. This is perfectly sealed and medical grade, no shortcuts there. I was a bit disappointed because for some reason I thought there was more than one suture in here. So maybe too expensive."
5,Medical kit addition,It seemed that this would make a real good addition to our medical kit and it is easy to fit it in. Doyle
4,review?,I haven't needed to use it so bit of an awkward review. Hope to not ever need it but there it is waiting for its bloody debut.
3,Caution! May cause pain if used. Just ask anybody who is cut.,"I have chased my pets for hours to get to test this suture kit but their having nothing to do with it. I don't have any younger siblings to test it on because they have all moved away, possibly for safety reasons. Finally I can't get my hands to stop shaking so I can make a deep enough laceration (Ten dollar word for CUT) that will require suturing (STITCHES). So, I'll have to get back to you after the Trick-or-treaters start bugging me."
1,Find another seller,"This is the reason for one star.Haven't used them yet, but $6 for shipping for something that weights less than a fraction of an ounce!? Criminal! Yeah, I didn't pay attention when checking out. Would never have bought them for that cost.Product is probably a 5 star item. Going in my emergency pack and hope I never need to use them. Need to find another supplier if I'm going to practice with them."
3,Purchased but not used yet thankfully,Sutures came well packaged and undamaged. I havent had a need to use yet but will update if I use.
2,Gold ball studs,"Came in a plain box with a swath of cotton, no certificate, no 14 k tag,no notes or letter. For all I know, they could be a light platting or even used jewelry."
2,Poor backs ruin this earring,"Dec. 2009- The posts/backs have not gotten any better.... one back did not last taking the tag off (it is an adhesive tag attached to the circle of the back.. bent way out of shape and can't be bent back. Earring itself is nice.. but no indentation on the end of the post to hold the back on. If you are going to buy any of Amazon's earrings, expect to have to find new backs that fit the earring post."
2,"nice earrings, but I lost one!!",This earrings are definitely made to be lost!!! They're gorgeous but they seem to just fall off your ears... be warned...
1,Lost earring first day,The earrings looked great but the clasp did not hold. I wore earrings once and when I got home I noticed left earring was gone. The clasp on back did not hold. I looked everywhere and never did find it. Kind of expensive for one wearing.I would love to have another pair but won't be paying for one.
2,Lost one yesterday,"I loved these earrings, but also noticed that the backs were tiny. I didn't have a problem putting them on or taking them off, but yesterday one of them fell out sometime during the afternoon. It's gone -- probably never to be found. These are pretty, but be sure to use your own larger backs."
3,earring,"I was a little disspointed the earrings were hollow and the backs very small. However, for the price still can not beat it."
5,Delicate and beautiful for a wonderful price,"These 7mm earrings are the perfect size, and of very high quality. The person for whom I bought them is petite, and they complemented her looks and style -- she wore them right away! I am very pleased with the gift and the reaction to it, so I would recommend this item wholeheartedly."
5,A Good Buy,Perfect extended wear. The gold will not cause earlobe irritation and they are a nice understated compliment to any outfit... Very classic. I really like them.
3,size,I like to gold ball earrings but the size is larger than I expected. I like to wear them in my second piercing. I now will wear them single.
2,"Nice earrings, but too big for me","These earrings are very pretty and nice. However I was looking for earrings for my second hole and they were much larger than I had expected - too large for a second hole. If you like wearing studs on your first hole, these would probably be nice (but still quite large for studs). Appeared to be great quality. I did end up returning them though, since they were larger than I had expected."
4,14k White Gold 7mm Ball Earrings,"The item has arrived in perfect timing. The earrings are good quality, but not the best one."
3,Earrings,"Good size. The back fell off so I'm hoping this isn't a problem. Not sure if it was loose, or something I did. Earrings are nice otherwise."
2,Poorly made,"Loved these when I got them, they looked great. However, I wore them twice and the second time the post fell off the earring. They are poorly made."
5,Terrific value for gold earrings,"These earrings just arrived, and for $10 (Friday sale), you cannot beat this value. Luckily I bought two pair, one as a gift, and one for me, on the off chance I liked them. Otherwise, I thought, I could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters. No way; the second pair is mine."
2,not as good a product as I thought,"These earings were ok for about a week. After that, the back of the earing started coming loose. I actually lost an earing and found it, just because It was too loose to stay on my ear."
3,Ok for Price - but take note,"If you are interested in this item, please take a minute to look at my two cents. I'll try and keep it brief:1. Keep expectations on the quality realistic. These are nice earrings for the price, but think department store nice as opposed to jewelry store nice.2. They look better than they feel - i.e. shiny but of somewhat insubstantial weight for their size (see item #1).3. I don't regret buying them but I really wish i had replaced the backs, because the first time i tried them on I knew there wasn't enough friction with the post. The earring can be completely pulled from your ear without much force, something as casual as brushing your ear against a sweater or phone receiver is enough.Within 2 weeks of purchase i had already lost one of the earrings, and didn't even feel it coming out of my ear."
2,Posts Too Short/Tension Backs Too Small,"The ball earrings are beautiful and I was very disappointed to find that the posts are so short, what you would expect to find on earrings for a small child. The posts were also thin, but that was okay. Also, the tension backs were so tiny, I had a hard time handling them. If I had purchased them for the Jan 2007 price, I might have kept them and had new posts and backs put on by my local jeweler. The photo shows the posts and backs to be more substantial. Sadly, I have to return them."
3,Keeps falling off.,Everything is great but it keeps falling off because the post is not secure. I wish it was made with a screwback or more secure back.
1,Action?,"I am confused. Bad singing,sound and chops.Mediocre arrangements.Why even do this.Tried to endure just one song the whole way thru.A real gem. Only a deaf person should own this."
3,Stand,"Dont expect great quality,but it does the job.Drip pan hole that slides over main tower is way to big and is only pressure held buy one large allen head screw which is almost to short.This resaults in a fairly unsecure drip pan holder.Workmenship isnt pretty,but as i said it works."
3,008. Code Name Celopatra...,"I gave this item a 3 star rating because although there are some special features, Universal could have made a better effort, and lets face it, this show isn't masterpiece theater.A lot of people will tell you this show is all about hot babes in slutty outfits who fight mutants with laser gauntlets. They're right. Sex and action are the two driving forces of this show but there is also an interesting story arc that develops throughout both seasons. Trust me. If you give the show a chance you'll actually like the characters, their friendship, the action, and the story lines."
3,"It's not Xena, but it is fun!","I started watching this right before they cancelled it. I wanted to see the whole thing, so I ordered it. If you love old campy shows like Wonder Woman and Batman mixed with a little sci-fi fun of old campy Star Trek, get Cleo now! If you like your post-apocolyptic, sci-fi a little darker with better special effects, tune into Battlestar Gallactica, Farscape, or Firefly."
4,Silly and fun,"This short lived series is just pure science fiction bubblegum. A stripper from the 20th century winds up in the 26th century. Along with two friends she winds up fighting robots, an evil overlord wanna be, and learning to live in a new time. There is no way this is not going to be cheesy as heck.It's a whole lot of fun though if that's your sort of thing. I inflicted this show happily on my family after finding it on DVD. B-grade by intention, it does at times surpass it's ridiculous premise."
4,Guilty!,"Yeah, this is a classic example of a guilty pleasure DVD. Obviously Cleopatra 2525 isn't full of deep social commentary, and watching it doesn't spark hours of philosophical debate at universities around the globe, but if you want to see three exceptionally hot women jumping around in midriff-baring outfits and having great fun, this is the set for you!"
2,let's be honest people,"This is coming from a huge, huge sci-fi fan. I try to watch every series and give it a chance. Cleopatra is not a good show, it's totally corny and I find it boring. Cleopatra is hot but the other two girls aren't even that attractive. The story is ridiculous and the action is cheesy. I warn anyone reading these positive reviews, they're put there by hardcore fans of the show....not to take anything way from their apprecition or dedication but most people will find this show terrible. Rent it from netflix first."
1,Ooooooh dear,"If i was to be kind, I'd say it's trying to be a 'homage' to Barbarella. I lost two hours of my life watching the first few episodes. I didn't continue. Does anyone know if it gets better ? Being a Firefly fan, I thought it'd be good if ""Zoe"" was in it. Not so. It's the kind of series that gives Science Fiction a bad name."
3,"Worth buying, but what about Jack?","I only watched this show because of Jack Of All Trades... that show truly deserves a DVD release. Its so unfair that the two shows were placed back to back, yet only this one is available.Please, please, please release Jack Of All Trades on DVD!"
3,Positively Sinful! - so make that Three AND-a-HALF Stars!,"! i !These girls was naughty; what with their provocative squats and the scantily-clad nature of their almost-costumes.Many people blame the cheesy scripts and amateurish acting for having gotten the show cancelled; the truth is that hate-driven little store-front ""churches"" all over America waged vicious letter-writing campaigns against the show and bullied their local stations into taking it off the air.Thanks be to Bob Almighty that we were saved from these vixens' naughtiness by those good folks' moral superiority - we might've laughed out loud and offended Bob!The very idea of an underground society of human beings fighting a ruling class of robots for survival is a blasphemous affront to the one-true-Bob (praise His Holy Name!).Unless, of course, it was MEANT to be satirical . . .Hmmm.Could that be it?If you missed the humor the first time around, here's a chance to dig it again and corrupt your mortal soul!."
1,Paranoid on Mars,"Thumbing through this book at the bookstore, and seeing all of the NASA pictures, I got the impression that it is an authoritative treatise on life on Mars. Instead, once I read it, I found that it is a badly written conspiracy book. It seems that the author is convinced that the entire space science community is allied against Gilbert Levin, the book's central character. The author seems to see coverups by NASA in every corner - all with the odd purpose of covering up what the author says is clear proof that the Viking robots discovered life on Mars. In addition to the conspiracy aspects of the book, it is horribly organized and jumps all over the place confusing this reader immensely. Someone should have hired an editor and a few real scientists to review this book before it was printed."
2,What a waste of my time !!!,"Mr. Digregorio is a regular visitor at the MSNBC space chat page. Given his strongly-voiced, and often passionate concerns about our environment, and the potential threat posed by a sample return mission from Mars, I read his book. When I opened the cover I was against all sample return missions. Now that I have read his book, and its inaccurate, contrived excuses and bad science, I have to say that I no longer fear the prospect of having samples brought to Earth from Mars. This book is simply awful - the author seems to be on some sort of political rehabilitation kick for several has-been space scientists - who just happen to be co-authors - hence co-royalty collectors - each time this book is sold."
4,great costume!,"this is a great costume. i have never seen a police costume that looked so much like the real thing. the quality of the material itself is a bit thin and stiff but most costumes are that way. my only real complaint is that the hat does not have a strap like the one in the picture and because the top doesn't have much give (meaning it is straight as opposed to curved to allow room to cradle the head) it doesn't stay on. we had to create our own strap. other than that the price is great, the costume looks like the real thing and it even comes with toy handcuffs! also shipping was immediate. vendor has great service!"

4,Greatest Hits but no Best Of...,"This compilation is their greatest hits minus their top 40 hit Soul & Inspiration. It also lacks some of their best known material such as A Little Bit Country, A Little Bit Rock N' Roll and their closing show theme May Tomorrow Be A Perfect Day. Here's my version of their Greatest Hits: I'm Leaving It All Up To You, Morning Side Of The Mountain, It Takes Two, Make The World Go Away, Together, Deep Purple, A Little Bit Country..., Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing, Soul & Inspiration, Winning Combination, Baby I'm Sold On You, On The Shelf, Certified Honey, May Tomorow Be A Perfect Day.Am I asking for TOO MUCH?"
3,OK for the most price conscious,"Curb Records has been pumping out Osmond family CD's for a long time now and has yet to get it totally right. In this budget piece of only ten tracks, are the supposed greatest hits of Donny and Marie as a duo. Even with only ten tracks, seeing as they had a total of seven top-100 charting singles, there is certainly room to include all those songs. One of them, their version of ""Soul And Inspriration"", has been left off in favor of a b-side. Granted, most of their hits are here but why not all of them?Repertoire considerations aside, the sound quality here is adequate with all tracks in stereo and the liner notes contain a brief musical history on these Osmond siblings.For its purpose, a budget collection of most of their singles, this fits the bill but for a few dollars more you can get better Donny and Marie collections elsewhere."
5,HT-135 STRETCHING Human Touch Home Massage Chair / Recliner,"I love this chair use it every night. Manufactured by Interactive Health, Inc, Customer Service:(800)-355-2762. http://www.interhealth.com.I purchased the chair from a furniture store so I was able to test it before I bought it. This is better than a chiropractor because it's always available and feels great.There is so much good to tell that I can't list them all. I have neck and back pains and use this chair to relieve my tight muscles. The HT 35 comes with a corded remote which I prefer because if you recline you can see it to change settings. Some of the control units in their OTHER MODELS are built in the arm and if you are reclined you can't see it to change a setting. If Amazon rated to 10 stars,I would have rated it 10 stars. Don't let you 90 day waiting period go by if you want to get the extended warrenty."
5,Small Book - Large Content about a Big GOD!,"This is such an incredible little book! I read this several years ago and after going through some really tough times have found myself craving to read this book again. I can't find my copy (probably loaned out) so I'm buying a new one. If you need hope, if you need to know that others understand, if you need a clarifying of the issues at hand - read this book."
2,Not Really Worth It... Too Dim.,"Not really worth it. They went in OK and looked good but they were a little dim compared to clear/amber bulbs. One burned out after a month or so, so now stuck with just one. Took it out and put in clear/amber bulbs. Try LEDs, that is what I am going to do. Even is they don't look good at least I don't have to worry about them burning out."
3,AN INTERESTING AND SOMETIMES ENLIGHTENING READ.,"THIS BOOK IS EPISODICALLY INTERESTING, BUT LEAVES ME WITH DOUBTS AT ALMOST EVERY TURN. IT TELLS EVENTS IN A LIFE THAT HAS BEEN QUITE A JOURNEY BUT DOES SO IN A PREDIGESTED WAY. THE SIGNAL LINE IN THE BOOK IS TO THE EFFECT THAT IF I HAD NOT LEARNED ZEN MEDITATION I WOULD NOT REALLY BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE RICHNESS OF JUDAISM. IT IS, AGAIN, A STRIKING IDEA, BUT AN UNREALIZED REVELATION FOR THE READER."
2,Poor,"Note that other reviews are from about 10 years ago.This book is extremely dated... the fonts themselves are Pierre Roubillard's old (very crude) font set.The grammar is accurate enough, but very ponderous. Here is not a translator, but an academic, pedantic scholar. If you merely enjoy the ""fun"" of intellectual scholarship and mental nit-picking, this is for you.If you really want to read or speak Tibetan, then Tournadre and others are appropriate. Actually, it is quite shameful that they are charging $50 and the book has not been updated in 15 years. Is this laziness or arrogance?"
3,"Decent, but ...","This is the first book I bought at the start of my journey into Tibetan. The overall strategy of this book is to build an hybrid Tenglish (Tibetan-English) language, which should gradualise and faciltate the student's approach to Tibetan texts. I regard this idea as essentially flawed and therefore I basically agree with the less enthused reviewers.Still, this is a honourable work and it may be useful for a first, cautious approach to classical Tibetan. If you want to plunge into the real thing right away, I suggest you buy Stephen Hodge's ""Introduction to Classical Tibetan"" (if you can find it)."
3,Less enthused,"I am less enthused about this massive tome than the other reviewers. I have a feeling that the book has failed to make the transition from a very lively university course to a textbook. The approach using all the different 'dimensions' is rather idiosyncratic. There problem is that there are few other choices when it comes to Tibetan textbooks. There is a heavy reliance for examples on the literature of logic. In my opinion more examples from practice-related material would have been useful. Too much reliance is placed on traditional Tibetan grammar for my liking. And that romanisation is unnecessarily complex. Still, it is a very significant work, and inspite of its short-comings, is still the best in this small field."
4,Adventures of the Snake Women,"This is a light, enjoyable tale about two snake demons who want to become human. The story begins when they have achieved human form as a reward for centuries of good works. In their quest to become fully human women, they meet and marry Li Fong, an apothecary's apprentice. The household prospers with the help of the snake-women's magic. Unfortunately, their domestic bliss is threatened by a dishonest Taoist magician and a misguided Buddhist priest . . . .Price seems to have a rather stereotypical view of women that makes it obvious that the book was written in the 1970's (most likely for a male audience), and his characters tend to be somewhat flat. However, since the snake-women are not ""real"" women, it isn't too objectionable. I found myself more than willing to overlook any deficiencies in characterization in favor of the imaginative and entertaining plot."
4,Madam White Snake,"I found this pulp novel in a second hand store and picked it up for the fun of it. I was surprised to find it a rather good retelling of the clasic Chinese folk and opera tale, Madam White Snake. There is some variation in the ending, and the names have been changed.The author gave no credit to the Chinese tales from which his plot is obviously formed. - one star for that."
5,A New Favorite Author,"I found this book by accident and was drawn to it because author wrote Lilies of the Field- a favorite movie of mine.A Woman in the House has made me a Barrett fan. It is the life of a Russian Monk after WWII in Germany. He has talent and training to return objects of art to their original beauty and uses this talent to make a meager living. There is much that needs mending and restoring in post WWII Europe. His simplistic view of life was very appealing to me. The routene of his life is fullfilling until he meets a woman who is very ill. He has cared for many in his life as a monk, but is unprepared for what is required to take care of a woman. He has had little experience with women, having lived mostly in the society of men. The unfolding story made me read for hours until it was complete.This story makes me ready to track down more Barrett books."
5,"A better title for this novel would be ""The Restorer""","Set in Europe 1949 through 1969, the novel tells the story of Konrad who was raised in a monastery under the tutelage of Father Stephen who appreciated and cultivated Konrad's potential. After Father Stephen's death Konrad travels earning his living by restoring damaged artifacts. He also mends damaged lives, two young boys, a lonely war veteran and a young woman in poor health who has been rejected by her parents.The villain of the story is the political uncertainty of post WWII Europe. Proper documentation for the individual was a must. Even with proper papers people were wary and uncomfortable about strangers. This story reminded me how lucky I was to be living in the USA at the same time."
3,"Great magazine, high subscription cost","This magazine if great for Cabin/Cottage living and life on the water. My husband and I get lots of useful information out of this magazine and save back issues for years. However,we cannot understand why the subscription rate is so high. If the subscription rate were 1/2 as much we'd probably subsribe for many years, but have a hard time with the approximately $7 per issue (U.S. customers). It seems like a highway robbery. Granted it's by far the best cabin/cottage magazine out there, as opposed to Coastal Living or others that seem geared to the Million dollar vacation homes, whereas this one seems to touch all home styles and true seasonal cottages/cabins, etc. We wish there was something so good on the U.S. side of the border."
4,Oldie but still useful,The calculators used are out of date but the programs are easily adapted to the newer calculators. I still find the programs useful. The book saves me the time of writing the programs from scratch.
1,Live at the Agora is aweful,"Don't be duped as I was about this bootleg amature recording. I grew up listening to and love the music of Starz. They are talented musicians and can rock the house. I have a number of LP's which represent them well. However, this recording is garbage. While the performance may offer some insight as to the energy of the band, the sound is just downright terrible. The previous review spoke of what a wonderful release this is. Don't buy into this. This CD is one of the worst I have EVER experienced and is a waste of hard earned cash - don't be duped."
3,dayxday,"I found this watch on Amazon and was thrilled; until like the other reviewer, I received it and it did not work! Not only didn't it work, but there was a big scratch on the back of it! I even had the battery checked to see if it could be fixed, and the battery was fine, but the watch obviously wasn't. I do love the watch and plan to re-buy it which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars."
2,Mediocre,"It was acceptable for the price paid, but very little jumped out at me as being terribly useful. I thought the penny-pinching techniques went a little too far into the ridiculous. If you follow some of this advice you will waste a lot of time saving a little bit of money."
3,Way too much money for what they are!,I was so excited when I saw there were new items for this set. We went to BRU the day aftr I discovered them fully intenting on buying them all. Well we got the growth chart and photot album but we left them on the shelf.They are very small (maybe 9x9)canvas prints. The dresses are exactly like the ones in the set and hte colors were just a bit off. It just didn't seem to match exactly right and it was way too much money! You can get a set of hte three plush dresses for the same price and they are much cuter.
5,lost to history,"This was a GREAT band. At the time a lot of people liked them better than the Clash. They rocked harder, played their instruments better. Sadly they didn't make enough product before singer malcolm owen ODed for the biz to have any incentive to keep them available and because this music was so hard to come by a lot of people never got a chance to hear it. This, like the Clash, was punk music that got rock fans to listen to it and changed a few lives."
1,Patsy was a murderer,"I have no doubt in my mind that this woman snapped and clobbered her daughter upside the head with one of her many trophies. The girl peed her bed nightly and I think Patsy snapped. BUT, why does a child pee their beds...sometimes a medical condition, sometimes because of abuse. She dresses her daughter up like a little prostitute and practically hands her over to her husband to appease his sexual appetite while she is going through cancer treatment. I think Patsy got very jealous and snapped."
1,"You only saw the side, Patsy wanted you to see.","Had I committed this crime and my friends saw me as the perfect mother, I would surely have expected the same. I remember a quote from a newspaper concerning the two students who murdered the Zantop Dartmouth professors, ""If these two above average young men comitted this crime I would surely lose all faith in mankind."" They confessed and were convicted. So I certainly think this book did nothing but circumvent the real issues, express one's own feelings and sympathy. Good try!"
1,For non-thinkers only!,"OK, we read about the perfect mother but have you ever considered how many criminals were true 'angels' before the were arrested for their hideous crimes? Too many indeed.As far as I am concerned, Patsy Ramsey has to be judged based on the facts and not her life-style before the 25th December 1996, and the facts are that she may not killed her daughter, but surely covers up the killer.."
1,Propaganda,"Useless Ramsey propaganda which skips every major detail of the murder investigation. Patsy Ramsey is apparently perfect, with the exception of that brutal murder of course. What murder you may ask?"
2,Not a well rounded book,"If you are looking for an unbiased look at the case, read Perfect Murder, Perfect Town not this one. This is 'propaganda' from Patsy's friend, just how wonderful her friend is. Heh, a lot of times when people who knew murderers are interviewed they say they seemed like nice people etcc.. That Patsy is a good friend, mother, sister etcc.. does not eliminate her as a suspect in my mind. I am 99.9% sure she did it from reading other books and looking at the facts. Therefore it is hard to recommend this book except for the great photo's that only someone on the inside could get."
1,Okay? So? Now What?,"This book does nothing to allay the supicion I have for Patsy. Just because Patsy's friend points out all the ""wonderful"" things as well as the lack of ""dark sides"" of Patsy does not excuse Patsy's evasive behavior and nor does it change the fact that Patsy DID have a dark side even if she did not murder her daughter. Patsy making JonBenet into her alter-ego is a ""dark side"" and a pretty bad one at that. The story is one sided and ends with emotional cries of foulness to the general public who feel the Ramseys are guilty (or at least acting guilty). There is no consideration of the FACTS of the murder in this pro-Patsy ""Miss can do wrong"" book. I am not impressed."
1,HOGWASH!,I tossed this book in my circular file. Linda Mc- lean sees Patsy through the filters of emotion and the fact that she has a relationship with her. She does no justice to the facts of the case. Her book is just an emotional backlash at the gereral public who believe that the parents are guilty.
1,I could not believe the author,"Who would not want to believe that a mom was a victim? It is a travesty if true; Unfortunately, the book is not believable. C.Ford"
1,Nightmare Product,Because of this horrible piece of software I had to wipe my hard drive. System hanged.No way to remove the software or get back to windows xp. Lost everything.
1,Absolute piece of ....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I installed this software after reinstalling XP. I had a perfect setup, with all the software I would like to have if I needed to reinstall. I load this crap, and rewrites my drive letters, and completely freaks out my system!I have to reinstall everything because it will only show ""Load Error press any key to reboot..."", and it won't go away. When I reinstall XP, I see that it changed my bootable drive to drive letter ""I"", and XP will not boot from ""I"".STAY AWAY... This is dangerous stuff, and norton should stick with anti-virus.STAY FAR, FAR, FAR AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Can Cause Write Errors,I have used this before with no problem but it caused write errors when I installed it. I took uninstalled it.I have seen others with the same problem. I would not recommend it.
1,Bad Company with bad products and bad support,"Several years ago I had a problem with a Norton product. After a lot of time and effort I finally got the product removed. At that time I decided that a company that would make it so hard to uninstall a product must have no regard for their customers. I have since refused to install any SYMANTEC products and at all my customers I remove any SYMANTEC products. After reading these reviews on GOBACK, SYMANTEC is even worst than I could have ever dreamed. No one should ever trust any thing SYMANTEC ever says about their products. This review is not about GOBACK but feel so strong about SYMANTEC that I wanted to help row their boat into the rocks. Sorry that I had to give it one star as it should be minus many stars."
1,"Danger, danger, danger - do not install this software!","This product is absolute rubbish - made my brand new PC impossible to boot. Even screwed up the PC manufacturer's fail-safe system recovery partition! Had to spend 7 hours recovering the hard drive and re-installing everything, ironically just the scenario that GoBack is supposed to prevent. Symantec support were not contactable! How can a company with Symantec's reputation allow this product out without a serious health warning?? Install GoBack at your peril!!! This is the last time I trust Symantec."
1,Troublesome Junk,I am writing this to warn anyone who might be considering buying this software for their pc. I have spent the last 3 days trying to find a solution and repair my dell desktop due to Nortons Goback software getting corrupted and stuck in a loop that would only prompt me to choose a restore point at startup. None of the restore points would work and every one took me right back to the same prompt. I found myself stuck in an endless and pointless loop. I have defended Norton products in the past and I own most all of Nortons products. Now I am done with Norton. I hope I save a few people from wasting their money on this troublesome junk.
1,Piece Of S*&t,This software will become a nightmare for you one day when your computer won't boot check that problem online
1,DON'T BUY!,Worst program I've ever used. Caused me to have to reinstall windows.You will be very sorry if you use this program!
1,Don't load this product.,"I recently purchased Norton Internet Security 2006 that came with a complimentary copy of Norton GoBack 4.0. After installing NIS 2006 with some problems I finally got it working and was pretty happy with it.Unfortunately, I then decided to install GoBack 4.0. I was prompted to restart windows, and then my computer was gone. Just a black screen from that point.I spent three hours on the phone with Symantec and then decided HP could better help me. Luckily, my computer was under warrantee and will be sent in for re-formatting. Unfortunately, to recover my data I had to take it in and have no guarantees of getting anything back.I would definitely avoid this product. A couple hundred dollars in data recovery, and I still ahve not found out whether I will be getting any data back. Add to that a 3 days for the recovery process and another 5 or so for re-formatting; loading this program can become a pretty expensive proposition. Hope this helps."
1,Be very careful using Go Back,"After installing Go Back, I rebooted to complete the installation, as instructed. My computer would not reboot. Long story short: According to the tech who finally figured out the problem, the program made my hard drive unrecognizable on start up. After three hours of work, he fixed the error, and uninstalled Go Back. A cursory search on the Internet shows that this is a common problem. Norton should provide a fix for this, but I'm not aware of one."
1,GoBack - does it cause hard disk churning (?),"After I installed GoBack 4 on my new computer, the hard disk spent all its time churning away non-stop. I managed to ""disable"" GoBack. It took three hours to remove its ""history"". But now my hard disk is back to normal. It sits quietly, doing nothing unless I'm accessing it. Is it possible GoBack was keeping the hard disk in action, searching for changes, and saving constantly?"
1,Will Badly Mess Up Dual Processor PC's,It would have been nice if it was made clear that GoBack doesn't work on dual processor PC's. Especially before it corrupted my hard drive. The fine print in the support section mentions it; this should be openly stated up front.
1,What a waste of money,"I installed Norton Go Back on my older pc years ago (never used it), it crashed and had a message, ""Go Back Internal Error Failure Code 9b_UI_Support (1147)"", which wouldn't let me get into the pc, so I took it to the computer doctor. When I received it back, I was able to get into the computer, but still had problems with the hard drive (kept rebooting as soon as windows appeared). I decided to buy a new pc and to stay away from the Norton GoBack. I wouldn't recommended this product to anyone."
4,GoBack tip,"Have been using GoBack since it was sold by WildFiles, and that's a loooong time. It's saved me more times than I can count. If you're using it and then have to restore your OS, be aware that GoBack hooks itself into the MBR with its own version and your drive will then appear unrestorable. T'ain't so. Go find another computer and download the lastest version of UBCD4Win and burn it to a disk. Set your BIOS to boot from CD-ROM if it isn't already so set, insert UBCD4Win and look for the ""Unhook GoBack"" tool. Run it and then you'll be good to go with your restoration. You'll want to keep the UBCD4Win disk around anyhow - tons of good tools on it; you can be your own guru. I've been running GoBack for years on a PATA IDE RAID 0 setup; no problems."
1,Keep your reciept. This product will need to go back.,"Installed on a Pentium D 3.0 Ghz with 320 hard drive. Everything had been peachy keen since I got the box a month ago. I installed the Norton suite amd turn on Go Back and mysteriously my hard drive dissapeared when I tried to start up the next time. Poof. Gone. I had to reformat and reinstall windows xp Media edition. At the time I didn't attribute it to this virus packaged as a helpful program. So I reinstall everything, for the past week, preformance has been degrading. Slower and slower. I am currently laughing bitterly at the box it is on because on boot at 4:20 pm eastern, Norton went all crazy and decided to GoBack! It is now 6:50 pm. I took a nap. The damn things is at 76% and has been there since I woke up. I am questioning if I should just turn the box off now. Possibly the worst software I have ever intentionally installed."
3,go back 4,"I used verson 2.2 on a Windows ME install, and it was great: rock solid security, guarding your entire hard drive.Then I upgraded to XP, and couldnt get either version 2.2 or version 3 to work - fortunately, I learnt how to uninstall it cleanly, because it was trashing the boot-up and everything else.Now they've released V 4.And I have to say, the reviews I'm reading here make me very angry.Everyone knows what GoBack does - great!But this is serious, boot level, DOS level surgery that SOMETIMES GOES WRONG. So why can't they test, test, and test a hundred times again, and write a manual telling you all about it - WHEN you can use this, and when you CAN'T.I'd like to have the Go Back protection agian, its a great utility, but what I'm reading here just confirms the old XP install problems.SORT IT OUT, SYMANTEC! THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!"
1,I'm planning on suing Symantec in small claims court over this,"This product destroyed over 40+G on my third internal drive when I loaded it. There was no reason for it to even access that drive, but it retooled it and left my other 2 drives alone. It cost me $500 to try to repair the drive and eventually I replaced it. I have that drive sitting in a box, waiting until I have $2000 to have it ""slow read"" to see if I can get the data back. This product is a nightmare and I intend on making Symantec pay for the money out of my pocket. No amount could ever pay for the data that I lost, which was all family photos and videos. This program is a disaster."
1,"If go back rating had a 0, that's what I would put!","I just re-installed my system works, and this time I decided to use the whole program including go-back. Now I am stuck in this twilite zone loop! I can not see my main drive, all I see is the go back window and do you want to reboot.BUYER BEWARE!! Do NOT BUY THIS! IF YOU VALUE WHAT IS ON YOUR HARDDRIVE, STAY AWAY!Please!"
1,Stay Away from this junk!,"Believe the bad press about this software - it is evil. It killed my disc which now won't boot or slave. I'm looking at a rather large bill to recover my data and have little hope of even a refund from Norton.Until now I had good luck with Norton software but apparently GoBack eats drives with partitions. This must be a fairly well known problem yet they do nothing to warn anyone. I got this junk as an upgrade to System Works. In any case, Norton will never see another dime from me. DO NOT LOAD THIS SOFTWARE!"
1,GoBack is worth its cost -- free,"GoBack was included when I bought Norton Internet Security. I am security aware and have never had to repair seriouss problems caused by virus etc. This GoBack took several hours of starting and stopping, defrag sessions, and still ended with a message that it was unable to complete whatever it needed to do. It gave no direction from that point, but I feel lucky that it didn't screw up my hard drive. Avoid it."
5,Saved again,"Over the years I have used Go Back numerous times, especially when the restore utility would not or could not reproduce earlier files. Go Back has never failed me, I just have to remember to back data files such as Quicken before using Go Back as newer, unbacked files will be erased and replaced with old data files."
2,NOT a book for learners...,"This book takes the history rather than knowledge and puts it into long, boring paragraphs. An excellent book if you want to learn how Christianity took over older religions. Not to complain, I'm multi-religious, but still a useless treatise on invasions and etc. For people that want to learn something, books by Scott Cunningham are excellent..."
5,"Cheryl Mayfield Brown,author - COOK'N TO KEEP HIM",Medisin is a strong dose of medicine for anyone who is serious about attaining and maintaining optimal health. This book is a MUST READ!!
4,Unbelievable Information,This is a mind blowing expose of the medical industry. Unbelievable reading! One can take it to heart or disbelieve. Either way it's an enlightening and eye opening read.
1,Not safe,"I bought two of these. Everything seemed fine for a few weeks but when the summer weather heated up, the plastic softened. We heard a crash in the middle of the night and woke to find a bike lying on the hood of the car. We thought maybe the hanger was defective. The next afternoon we came home to find the other bike lying on the floor of the garage. Don't buy it for a bike.I also own the 1-piece bike hangers from Racor and they work fine."
4,Large sized Crocs,The product arrived promptly and I was very satisfied with the service. It is difficult to obtain large sizes in stores and the ability to purchase online is great for those of us who need non-standard sizes. The shoe itself is comfortable and I am happy with the purchase.
3,seems to run awfuly wide for a womens shoe.,"Came on time, store did a great job getting my order to me on time.The shoe on the other hand seems to be made more for a man than a women.The strap does not stay forward, if you decide to wear them without the strap in the back.I have an old pair of these crocks and they are just not the same."
3,Feels tight,I bought these crocs size 2XL 12/13. I wear size 13 2E and they feel rather tight. My toes are punching out the front holes of these clogs. I had the crocs chinese imitation size 13 and they feel more comfortable than the originals.Please be warned that these crocs are smaller than the one that came before.I think I should have bought the crocs baya or clasic as they come in whole sizes rather than a range of sizes. My foot always end up at the larger end of the range.
2,Rash on the top of my foot?!?,"I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden. when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch, I couldn't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear, but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks. I WON'T wear them again..."
4,Great Summer Footwear,"I bought these as an alternative to sneakers or boat shoes, my normal summer footwear.They are a lot lighter and cooler around the yard gardening and are quite comfortable. They are also excellent if you are swimming in a lake or a pond with a rocky or gravelly bottom. Easy in and out.One caveat, however. My feet are 10 1/2 and I bought what they call X-large (10-11). The sizes tend to run smaller; mine are a bit snug and have caused some chafing. I would recommend the next size up."
1,croc of crap,Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
3,crocs,"Color`s good. Style`s good. Only problem is-and this is kind of a big problem-the sizing is all wrong. My previous crocs were a size M10/W12, and they fit perfectly. So when I ordered these new ones, I ordered size M10-11/W12-13, thinking that, like all companies, they would start skimping on the sizing once they hit the big time to try and save on costs. I guess I should`ve ordered M12/W14. My feet have definitely not grown two whole sizes in the past two years."
3,"Would be great, but expect dry scaly feet if you wear them regularly","I bought a pair of these and got a pair for Christmas. I truly loved them, despite their clunkiness. They are really comforatble and durable. However, I started noticing that my feet were getting really rough. The same was happening to my boyfriend, who was also wearing them all the time. It took us a while to figure out the connection. We were slathering on the lotion and using a foot file every night. Suddenly we put it together. Once we stopped wearing the crocs, our feet got soft again. If you wear socks, it prevents the problem, but it looks pretty dorky. I hope they find a way to fix this problem, because I would love to buy more. But until they do I have to give them up if I ever expect a foot rub from my boyfriend, or the evil eye from the pedicurist."
5,Great shoes!,I bought my second pair of crocs and continue to love them. I had my mother in law try them on - and ordered her a pair as well. My mother in law has feet problems and she loves her blue crocs and wears them everywhere.
1,Not what I expected,"I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs. I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big, how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs? Had to send back and pay for shipping, not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website."
4,Great buy Color ugly,I purchases a 14/15 size croc for 1/2 the price sold every where else. Plus that large of size is unfinedable off line.They fit my big footed man comfortably. but the color is not Chocolate. It's more like a sh*! green. but we don't care that much..:)
1,crocs beach clogs,"I was very dissapointed with this product. I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada. These were made in China. They are not the same quality at all. These are not cushioned like the others were, they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada. These are NO better than the cheaper ""knock offs"" you find in dollar stores."
5,love my crocs,best thing i found for my feet...legs & back dont bother my at all anymore can stand all day...they are great
5,I Love Crocs!,"My daughter bought me a pair of Crocs 2 summers ago, and I've been wearing them since. In spring, when the shorts come out, the Crocs go on, and I don't take them off until fall. With this pair, I now have 6."
5,Crocs for sore feet,"I am not able to go barefoot because of some heel pain. I work in the kitchen a lot at home and this was causing pain in my feet. I looked into purchasing those gel mats for the kitchen but they are very expensive, someone suggested getting crocs as kitchen shoes! Perfect."
4,Crocs Clog,"I like the clogs but they do come a tad small, but I will live with it. They are spongey, lightweight and comfortable. They are one of the ugliest shoes known to man but they feel like I am walking on air."
5,Crocs Beach Clogs,The clogs are just what I need for working in the Garden. They fit just right and the vented croc keeps my feet from becoming too hot. The clean up is quick with the spray from the garden hose.
2,Oops,"We received the Crocs, which are my son's favorite shoe to wear. However, when he wore them to school the next day, one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school. We are hoping to return them and get a new pair--that will last longer than two hours."
2,Toes feeling uncomfortable through holes.,"Sorry. I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe. I will be returning, which I am bummed about, and, have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift."
5,Crocs beach rule!,"I have many crocs beach & this is the latest. Good for the wider foot. Great comfort, also great in the pool or lake, if you like. Dries fast. Washable, of course.HOWEVER, the sizes are not consistent. I sent back one pair I ordered from Amazon. They were 3/8 inch smaller than my other pairs in length, and also narrower, even though they were the same style/marked size (Men's M/Women's L) as my others. I requested another pair in a larger size. I received the same size I had ordered before, not the larger size I asked for(why? I don't know. Invoice reflected the larger size). BUT, the second pair, also Men's M/Women's M, fit perfectly and were the same length/width as my other Crocs Beach. So I'm happy, but wary of ordering online since Crocs says they have no way of telling if the size will be larger/smaller. It may have to do with where they are manufactured- Crocs has plants in many countries."
3,nice shose,&#1605;&#1605;&#1578;&#1575;&#1586;&#1577; &#1608;&#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587;&#1576;&#1577; &#1604;&#1604;&#1585;&#1581;&#1604;&#1575;&#1578; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1581;&#1585;&#1610;&#1577; &#1608;&#1604;&#1575;&#1603;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1591;&#1585;&#1602;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1581;&#1606; &#1594;&#1610;&#1585; &#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1587;&#1576;&#1577; &#1580;&#1583;&#1575; &#1608;&#1591;&#1585;&#1610;&#1602;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1590; &#1578;&#1581;&#1578;&#1575;&#1580; &#1575;&#1604;&#1609; &#1578;&#1591;&#1608;&#1610;&#1585; &#1575;&#1601;&#1590;&#1604; &#1608;&#1575;&#1606; &#1578;&#1603;&#1608;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1581;&#1606; &#1587;&#1585;&#1610;&#1593;&#1577;
4,Great concept in shoes,"Great for camping, fishing and boating. Easy to slip on for those late-night trips to campsite restroom."
2,Size problem,"I have bought several prs of crocs, but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small."
5,great beach/swim shoes,"We couldn't find the right size/color of crocs in any store, so we ordered them on-line. Within less than a week, we had the perfect summer shoe for our child."
5,Funny looking but wonderful shoes,"I must have weird feet, since for my entire life, and I fall into the senior category, I could never find comfortable shoes. I laughed at the Crocs looking like clown shoes, until I tried on a pair. Wow! Nothing hurt any more. It was a miracle. The bumps inside felt a little strange, but I soon got used to them. With wearing they will stretch a little, and I wear socks in the cooler weather. They wash and dry like a dream. They have cushion for my feet, support for my arch, and no more aching feet. If I simply must wear another shoe, I can hardly wait to take it off and get back to my beloved Crocs. I now own lots of colors, a winter lined pair, preferred to the non hole type which even in winter make my feet sweat. Comfort wins over looks, even though they are fashionable now. I wear the beach style, and the lined winter somewhat similar shoe. I hope they never go out of business!"
5,Crocs Beach - Review,"I love Crocs and have four pair total, including these white Crocs. My feet swell alot due to arthritus and fibromyagia. In addition, I sprained my ankle and pulled ligaments in my foot recently and the only shoe I have been able to use are Crocs and one pair of Birenstocks.It is so easy to walk in these because of the arch and heel supports. It almost feels like walking on a cloud, it is so comfortable. I had heard that the makers of Crocs were going to stop making them. I hope this is not true!! I don't know what I would wear if not for the Crocs.Thank you for continuing to sell these shoes.Best regards,Marge McCarthyDrexel Hill, PA"
5,I love all of my Crocs,"I love my Crocs - I have several pair, and would wear them with a suit if I thought I could get away with it. Sometimes the straps break, but hey - you don't really need them, anyway."
5,Big crocs for big feet,I wear size 15 shoes and have had trouble finding crocs in my size. These fit the bill (or the foot)!
3,Sizing very small,Already own a pair purchased about 2 years ago. Sizing is much smaller now even though I ordered the exact same shoe. The bottom of the shoe reads the same as before but it's about 1/2 inch shorter. Caution to order a larger size now!
3,They Are Crocs for Goodness Sakes,I think I bought these for my wife several years ago. The dog chewed them. He got more use than my wife.
4,"love the color, confusing sizing","I love my other pair of Crocs (Caymen style) so I've been looking for a yellow pair for awhile. I finally found them in a different style here, but when they arrived, it seems the sizing was on a little bit different system, because this style was a bit small for me. On my first pair, the size was a men's 7 / women's 9, and that worked fine. On this beach pair, it was a size range -M6-7/ W8-9 and they run small. Other than the confusing sizing between two shoes of the same brand, I love the shoes."
5,LIke walking on sponges,"From a distance, Crocs look rigid. I was at the Palace at Versailles this summer and saw a whole family decked out in what looked like super sturdy (and brightly colored) clogs. I thought they were European. As we were standing in line, I asked the Mom where they bought the colorful shoes and she replied she had purchased the lot on Amazon. She was also from the States as I came to find out. At that point she removed one and let me have a closer look.Upon arrival home, I obtained a pair and haven't taken them off since. They are SOOOOO comfy... like wearing slippers... you can't beat the variety of colors and the price is just right. While they are not the most flattering shoe one the foot, they do tend to make ones ankles look nice and skinny. Enjoy!!!"
1,MORE CHINESE STUFF,"I have worn Crocs for years. They are almost a must for diabetics. The ones on this page are made in China. The cheaper quality is immediately visible, the sizing is off and the last (shape of shoe) also appears different. I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice."
5,Can't beat them....,"for comfort that's for sure! It feels as many have stated, like walking on marshmellows. And the open design keep your feet cool. I got them on a very hot day and it felt soooo good to feel a cool wind on my toes with ""shoes"" on.Extremely lightweight as well. Feels like an ounce! The only drawback is they're not too dressy and they do not look too great with nicer outfits. Defo a casual shoe to loaf around in...."
3,"I thought they would describe the inside, also.","They have really big bumps and lots of them inside. Then the raised part under the toes is not too comfortable for someone with uncommon foot shapes. They are probably really good once you get used to them. I just looked inside the worn-out pair I have. They are smoother. I think they vary in the interiors quite a bit. I bought a pair of these, but returned them due to them being too bumpy. Mine are so old now, I don't know what they were like new."
5,comfort,Bought these for my husband and wasn't sure if he would wear them. He loves them as much as I love mine!
5,Love them.,I love my crocs. Walking around barefoot around the house hurts my feet. I love walking on these.
5,Best Shoes Ever,"I always wore birk's, but a friend told me about crocs and I have worn nothing else. The help my feet and my low back problems."
5,Crocs are awesome!,"Well made, comfortable, durable, water proof... Crocs are very versitile shoes and are great for water sports, beach wear, cleaning, rainy days, or just lounging around the house!"
1,If you wanted to know where is sex in American Cinema...,"The film is a must-see if you ever wondered why you there is pretty much none. It is a good history of sex in movies, mostly Hollywood. Somewhat depressing as it shows there is not much hope here...The film is Unrated just because if it was to be rated it should be PG-13. Just for example there is a lot of talking about the Sharon Stone scene, but the scene itself isn't!"
2,Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed, I thought it would be more bellydance than just another exercise dvd. I did like it for core training, but I already had several, so if you are looking for a core training video and don't already have one then this is great one to get."
5,Winwood is one of the greatest musos of all time,"You have to see this guy sing, play amazing hammond organ and play bass with his feet (yes that is correct, with his feet) and sing with that amazingly souful voice all at the same time! Not to mention those great songs that he wrote. The man is a genius. Was tempted to rate it as 4 stars only just because its so short and NO bonus interviews or background info. But I just cant stop playing it, which is what its all about.LOVE IT !"
3,Three defective DVDs so far,"I purchased this at Best Buy. It was defective. Exchanged it and the next one was defective. Sent it back to the distributer. Got a new one for defective number 3.I did see the first few songs and while clear, the performance lacks energy and spontaneity. Not one of the best DVDs. Traffic Jam is much better even though it has 8 zillion interruptions between songs.Update: I have a working copy and its a grat cd. Would change my review to 5 star as it is one of may favorites."
2,So So Concert,This was not Steve's best work. I didn't particularly care for this concert. Although he is super in the Claption/Windwood concert!!!!!
3,Steve Winwood,"As much as I like Steve Winwood, I was not as satisfied with thislive concert as I was with the Dave Mason Concert I bought at the same time."
5,MARVELLOUS BOOK!,"This is one of the best books i have bought on Hypnosis ever! It develops a broad understanding of trance in its most useful state and through transcripts, examples, exercises and theory brings the reader to an accomplished understanding of trance and communication. This book is a clear, easy to follow text which would be useful to any hypnotherapist or Psychologist!. This is an original book and you wont' find the information in any other.. so...BUY IT _ BUY IT _ BUY IT - It's too wonderful to miss!"
1,joke,"This book takes a few facts about Erickson and tries to make it into a book. It would be much more useful to read an Erickson book. About the only thing useful in this book is their quote of Erickson of ""You can imagine and master anything."" People think they can pretend a trance with a hand full of words on several pages and a few quotes from famous books and have their own book.Save your money on this one and try ""Using your Brain"" By Bandler or ""My voice will go with you"" by Bandler and Rosie.At least you will get something for your money. I would have gone 0 stars on this one but 1 is as low as your can go."
1,Watch Out For Manipulation,"My goodness. Look at all the cheezy embedded hypnotic commands in the review dated October 12, 1999, below. The ""by now""/""buy now"" ambiguity is particularly lame -- not to mention obviously motivated, cliched, and manipulative.Let me invite novice readers to notice that some of the commands are even set off with hyphens. Why not just use billboards?Attempts at covert persuasion really shouldn't be this obvious."
4,Incompetent,"The review by Joke on March 29th gets the author of ""My Voice Will Go With You"" wrong. Sidney Rosen is the author."
5,A marvelous book!,"This book is great! I have read many books on NLP and Hypnosis, and listened to and watched many expensive tapes, but this book tops them all. Silverthorn and Overdurf are brilliant. I plan to get their other book as well. This is the only one that I have seen that really teaches well on both the conscious and unconscious levels. Others do well only on one level or the other. The only caveat that I might offer, is that the 'training' that is referred to is for the training of hypnosis. Other types of trainers will find it less useful. Still, anything that improves your life and communications will improve your training."
3,"Okay, Just Not My Thing","As with several other albums I've reviewed lately, I recorded this from an album to reel to reel tape 34 years ago, then just recently transferred it to CD. The sound quality is horrible but I can still hear the songs good enough to enjoy them.These former Shadows (at least one of them) are often compared to Crosby, Stills, and Nash. It is a fair comparison in style only, as they don't sound anything like CS&N.; The songs are pleasant and well done, there's just nothing here that stands out. Good singing, good musicianship. Not much else to my ears. Maybe their second album has more interesting songs, but this one is... I hate to say it, kind of bland.Those of you that like good harmonies in the vein of CS&N; will surely enjoy this, and for them I highly recommend it. For the rest of us, well..."
2,100 Planes 100 Years,"I think it's quite a good book if you're into the technical parts about aircraft, however if you're into just the planes then it's not worth your while buying it. Overall I wasn't impressed."
2,Short life span,"This fan was fine while it worked, but it lasted less than 12 months before the bearings ceased. That's a disappointingly short life."
4,A BIG thanks to Mr. Novey and all who fought with the 8th,"My personal interest through the years for the men who fought the biggest and bloodiest air war in world history has just gotten more intersting. Mr. Novey's book should be required reading for history sudents. This isn't about the generals or even about the pilots, but by the guy who could have lived next door.This isn't just about the shooting and action that so many seem to delve on, but the emotional turmoil that goes along with the knowledge that the odds of your going home aren't so good. His family history helps tremendously in giving a more human aspect to the book as well.Thank you Jack Novey and all those who fought with you, especially the thousands who never made it back home."
3,Not A Bad CD,"The horn player and piano are exceptional musicans. The female vocalist is damn good. Over all, the CD has a few really good tracks and few not-so-good. The mood of the CD is mostly on the quiet side. It's a very easy to listen."
3,Not A Bad CD,"The horn player and piano are exceptional musicans. The female vocalist is damn good. Over all, the CD has a few really good tracks and few not-so-good."
1,UGH,What a silly read. Why waste paper on this nitwit when there are plenty of decent authors out there who can tell a real story about a person with actual talent? Blech. zing zang beeble bibble bop!
1,Hahahaha,"Someone should take this book and beat ashlee simpson to death with it. Shes not a musician and she cant sing. She is absolutely USELESS. the only reason she ever got big is because she is jessicas sister and some idiot thought of this whole ""out of the shadow concept"". If, out of all the music and literature in the world you choose anything affiliated with ashlee simpson, you are a complete idiot and you should also be beaten to death with this book (unless your a little kid ,they dont know any better, yet)"
2,who put this together?,"This compilation was supposed to showcase the best of RAP-A-LOT RECORDS from the beginning until 1992 when this cd was released. But it doesn't quite do that. Tracks from The Convicts, The Terrorists & O.G. Style belong here, but the rest could have been better. They should have included songs like ""Bald Headed Hoes"" or ""5th Ward"" from WILLIE D - ""Mr. Scarface"" from SCARFACE - ""Mind Playing Tricks"" or ""Assassins"" from GETO BOYS - ""Psycho"" from GANGSTA NIP - ""The Payback"" from CHOICE - ""Freak To Me"" from RAHEEM as well as other cuts from older groups like DEF IV & ROYAL FLUSH. Whoever put this together please go back and release a real greatest hits for the 2000's: maybe a 2 disc set that includes artists like DMG, TOO MUCH TROUBLE, ODD SQUAD, 5TH WARD BOYZ, 5th WARD JUVENILEZ as well as the others I previously mentioned."
3,"Great Series, but poor quality DVD's","If you're a Sliders Fan, you don't need me to tell you why you'll want Season 3. Unfortunately, it is obvious that the company that produced and distributed the DVD's was more interested in turning a profit than in providing a quality product. My first order contained one deffective DVD. So did the replacement order. Amazon.com provided their usual excellent customer service, so the replacement process was painless. Bottom line? Be prepared to return at least one set of DVD's, so hold onto the first set until you receive the 2nd. That way, with luck, you may be able to build a complete working set."
3,It's all downhill from here.,"Seasons 1 & 2 are great. The storylines of alternate worlds where women are the dominate gender, where Russia rules America, etc, are genjoyable. In season 3, the show moves from this focus and how each earth is different. Instead, they introduce far out story lines such as talking fire and pregnant men. My uderstanding is that a new producer was brought in and changed the whole concept. This change in story lines causes John Ryhes Davies to be fired because he doesn't like the change. He then brings in a new character who doesn't mesh well with the rest. hese changed causes viewership to decline and FOX to cancel the show. The sci-fi cannel picks up the show for season 4 & 5 and drags it further down. There are still some good episodes in this season that are worth watching. After this season, it's unbearable. As another viewer noted it would have been better to end the show with the 3rd season."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"After finding the first two seasons thoroughly engaging I was surprised to find the the writing take a dramatic downturn on this third season with the characters becoming more one dimensional and the overall outlook becoming more cheesy and sanctimonious than Touched By An Angel. Plot devices were continuously recycled, oppresive governments, corrupt military officers/scientists/corporate execs, Quinn's damsels in distress and white knight act, the sliders constantly being surprised by how things in each new world aren't what they appear and taking the long way to figure out something that is easily apparent to the viewer. In addition to creativity being traded in for formulas certain episodes shamelessly rip off the creatures from the film Tremors and an X-Files episode where a noisy generator motor powers a light keeping creatures at bay."
2,Jumps the shark in this season,"I enjoyed the first season, and some of the second, but it really ""jumps the shark"" in season three. For me, the biggest problem was that it started taking itself too seriously, trying to get dark and edgy, with few comedic breaks to lighten the mood. Most episodes have them entering a dystopian world that I sure didn't want to spend even an hour in. The show should have taken the lead from Quantum Leap, which managed to balance a few more serious plotlines with more lighthearted fare. Perhaps if the show had started out being deadly serious, the transition would have worked better for me. Instead, it morphed into something it wasn't and slid into a season that left me behind."
5,REVIEW THIS GREAT SERIES IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING!,"Regarding the dolt who gave the set a one star ('Four Geeks in a cheap Time Travel show'). Why review if you don't obviously watch or know what the show is? It never was time travel. You probably tried the show when it started, and failed to understand that it was about parallel earths (or you just couldnt grasp the concept of 'same planet, different dimension'). As for the 'poor CGI' - for God's sake, this was back in the mid 90s when CGI for TV was just starting, and heck - the vortex fx DOES look good, even now. You are unjustifiably bitter, friend. Go back to series that you understand, without 'geek' (that is, intelligent) characters, which won't tax your poor old brain too much."
3,SLIDERS is sliding!,This third season suffers severely from the loss of Professor Arturo and lower budget(cheesy and simplistic sets and poor special effects). Nevertheless it is worth having for a few good episodes in it. Overall: DECENT.
3,Only a few gems here,"I do not like this season very much... THEY KILLED OFF THE PROFESSOR!! whatever i liked rules of the game, the exodus pt 1 & 2, season greedings, and just me probably but i liked slither. maggie is nice to look at so thats a plus, albeit wade is a better actress. I would have rather kept wade though over maggie for season 4. I just want to say too that the Guardian was not a good episode like everyone here is saying. IT SUCKED -- I MEAN THE PART WHERE THE PROFESSOR WAS FLIRTING WITH THAT BIKER CHICK IN THE BAR?!? LOL come on now people!!"
4,Horrible Case Design,"Whoever designed the cases/discs for both of the Sliders sets so far needs to be fired. Both cases are a huge risk to the discs. In the first one, its pretty easy to scratch them against one another. And this one is even worse!!! The double-sided discs wouldn't have been a problem if they hadn't arranged the case the way they did. Having to take the top disc out to get to the bottom disc? Absolutely ridiculous!. And you practically have to hold the case open with both hands just to open it wide enough to get the discs out without scratching them. Then, you've got no hands left to grab the disc(s)!!! If you plan on buying this series, plan on investing in a set of cases too. There's no way you should keep them in the case they come in."
2,a great series that lost it,"I was a huge fan of sliders, seasons 1 and 2....and something happened, perhaps with the change of leadership at the top. It went from being a sophisticated, adults sci fi show about the possibilities of alternate universes....to a show aimed at the 14 year old market, emulating sci fi monster films, breaking all of its own rules in the process. They couldn't go back in time, yet....guess what? They did! Monsters took over their bodies, aliens descended from other worlds....once the professor died, replaced by a silly bimbo, I couldn't watch anymore. However, the first two seasons were quite spectacular."
3,"Sliders, the tv series","Okay, read my review for fourth season. This isn't a keeper, but some elements are entertaining and there are some hidden esoteric truths within, if you can find the patterns running deep through it and so many other scifi storylines."
5,One Episode Only,"I wanted to watch this and missed the rerun on the DVR. I was able to quickly find the specific episode (it was two parts), pay 2 bucks and download and start streaming it to my computer"
3,Good Show Very Bad Packaging,"The show itself is good but this packaging is just the worse I've ever seen.I am going to repackage this myself and throw away this junk they put it in. There are hard plastic trays wrapped and glued on one side in a semi-ridged plastic. It is hard to get disks out because the plastic cover is stiff and likes to stay wrapped around the trays.The disks are double sided another negative. Also the universal logo and music plays at the start of each disk and at the start of each episode. Universal, showing me your logo over and over and over and over again will not brainwash me into buying your products, just an FYI. If I get sick of it there are ways I can remove it."
3,not bad,i really liked the show when it was on TV. i bought this and seasons 1 and 2 also. but the story line get old and Arturo is a big mouth that makes watching episodes back to back excruciating.
1,poor writing,"I am a big fan of sliders, but season three is really disapointing and has some of the worst story lines and writing. The first two seasons are imaginative and interesting, but i would skip right over this set."
3,WHERE IS THE SEASON 4???????,"SHORT BUT SWEET! THE SLIDER IS A GREAT SCI-FI SERIES WHEN I SAW IT YEARS AGO AND I'LL HAVE TO SAY THAT IT'S A 5 STAR THEN GOT 3 SEASON'S FROM THE DVD SET 1&2 WITH SINGLE DISCS THAT ARE GREAT SEASON THEN THE THIRD SEASON WAS DOUBLE SIDE'S THAT SUCKS BUT I STILL LOVE THE SERIES!!! KNOW THIS IS THE WORST THING I'VE EVER HAD THAT IT'S STILL WAITING FOR SEASON 4???? THE UNIVERSAL STUDIOS GUYS MUST HAVE ALZHEIMER'S OR SOME THING LIKE THAT, COME-ON YOU GUYS FLUSH THE TOILET AND LET'S GO! YOUR SLOW AS MOLASSES!!!!"
3,Sliders third Season,"Sliders was a great Sci-Fi show. The catalyst or culmination of various shows seen in most households. Charmed, Buffy, Star Trek or Quantum Leap can all claim to have a say in the making of this delightful series. The failure with this third series is the collapse of the essence in sci-fi; its cast. When you change cast, those replacing must be wittier, better and stronger as a character, unfortunately in season 3 we find that this is not the case. Still there are some very good episodes within the set. The Guardian, Exodus and Season's Greedings are some of the best episodes by far and would have been deserving of the quality of Seasons 1 and 2. However that is it as far as I am concerned, Seasons 4 and 5 are of no interest and the acting leaves much to be desired but as far as this DVD is concerned, I would say it is worth purchasing if only to complete your Sliders collection."
1,Packaging is C H E A P!!!!!,"While this is a fairly good series and the video quality is good, the PACKAGING REALLY STINKS! NO graphics of ANY kind, NO episode list, NO labeling on the double sided discs (except Side a and Side B). NO info AT ALL! CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP! Seriously disappointing! Double-sided releases ought to be outlawed! MUCH more prone to be damaged and NO info! Universal shows where it's interest lies - the bottom line! Keep it up Universal - and the bottom line may bottom out! GREED Stinks!"
3,okay,"good science fiction series, but with the changes of characters its got a different look to the show. Its is okay"
5,must have for any little bear admirer!,great dvd for anyone who loves to watch little bear. my daughter loves it.
1,Must Have Been Written In The Toilet,"I picked up this DVD because it had Amy Adams and Fred Savage and I expected something of quality...How wrong I was...The same plot would have been interesting in the hands of a SKILLFUL writer with a bigger vocabulary than every obscene word in the English language..At least Amy Adams did not discard her dignity but Fred Savage....WHAT A TRAGEDY...One cheap, disgusting scene after another...No one can watch this film without suffering at least some indigestion....""When one uses an obscenity, they stop Saying something and Become something..They take attention off their Thoughts and put it on their Words....I saw a lot of potential talent acting in a theatricl gutter.."
2,Sorry I bought it.,I expected more of Amy Adams in it.Mr Savage carries his Wonder Years label still and is not a hot enough guy for this role.
1,"""Awful"" is an Understatement","This film is as bad as films get. What happened to that sweet kid who used to be on TV? In any case, it looks like this film was pretty much the end of Fred Savage's film career. Amazing that Amy Adams would be found in a film this bad."
2,Promises a lot...fails to live upto it.,"I bought this title as I liked the concept and thought it had the potential to be made into a good movie. However I was dissapointed. The performances are good, but it was not as entertaining as it promised to be. Watch it only if you have seriously nothing to do."
2,"Wow, horrible. What the heck are the other reviewers thinking.","Wow, from what it looks like, so far I am in the minority, but this film was bad. Very bad. Sorry Fred Savage, this is now wonder, and it makes me think you should have packed it away years ago. I do sincerely like Fred savage, he is a decent actor, but wow, horrible film. Just dumb. Yeah, break-ups are hard, but gez man, have some confidence and self esteem. And the Ending...What the heck, she gave him a chance again....come on, seriously, is her self esteem that low that she thinks she can get no one else. Wow. Disfunction at it's finest. Eject the brain on this one, I just can't be dumb enough to like it. Thank goodness I rented this one...everyone else should avoid it. Now I am going to go get a lobotomy to remove the scaring memory of this stinker."
1,"Very, very dark","At first there are a couple of laughs and some cliche, predictable characters. You are rooting for Fred Savage's character at first. Then, ""the big idea"" turns dark... VERY dark, and I don't think that part of the movie was meant to be funny. It just made me uncomfortable. This is not a good comedy. Be forwarned."
4,"Nice sharpener, needs quality control","I have purchased three of these sharpeners over the years. They make great gifts and take all the technique out of proper sharpening. These sharpeners are designed great and really sharpen knives and scissors well. As you may have read in other reviews, the company does have some quality control issues; on the last sharpener I purchased, one of the porcelain sharpening rods wasn't glued in properly. As a result, it rotates while sharpening, not something that is supposed to occur."
2,Meh.,"I bought this while I was going through culinary school. At first I thought it was great.. however over a bit of time in combination with my knife having a bolster a hump began to form. Now I can't cut through many fine things like tomato skins, chives, onions...So overall, I think this would do for the home cook, but not for professional cooks."
1,Dulled every knife,Dulled every knife I tried.Had to request another one because one of the metal pieces was missing. Still no good. Person I called in NY asked me if I used it on Wustoff knives???Waste of money.
4,"Very practical, easy to use sharpening system","This is a very useful product. Had used a classic sharpening steel (rod) for years. There are several advantages to this product. It lies flat on a counter, and has non-stick pads so that it lies securely, doesn't slide while you are using it. That is a convenience as well as a safety feature. There are three sharpening features: one for coarse work (e.g. repair a nick in a blade); one that is ceramic (for honing a blade that is already in good shape, as well as for some knives that ONLY should be sharpened with a ceramic system[e.g. molybdenum alloy blades]) and one for scissors. The scissors feature may or may not be very useful - depending on the type and size of scissors. Should be fine for standard kitchen shears. I have had this for just a couple of weeks, but am very satisfied with the ease of use and the quality of the sharpening. It is a simple, useful design, and will hopefully prove durable as well."
4,Great tool,"This knife sharpener is great if used only infrequently. The scissor sharpener isn't all that great, but better than nothing. I use the sharpener to put an edge on the knives (only once or twice a year) and then use the honing steel every or every other time I use the knives. They are MUCH sharper than they have been in years."
4,"Great knife sharpener, poor on scissors","This device does a great job of keeping a sharp knife sharp, but difficult to use when sharpening scissors. I use this every day and had no problems with the stones turning as one reviewer observed."
2,My knives remained dull,"I used this sharpener according to the instructions, but my knives and scissors remained dull, so I had to return it. Furthermore, the scissors sharpener is rather hard to use, despite its looks."
4,Wusthof knife sharpener,This works great on all knives with straight edges...though I wish I had something to sharpen serrated knives!
1,Poor performing knife sharpener,The Wusthof knife sharpener is a poor performer. It takes way to long to produce a noticeable difference in the sharpness of knives and scissors.
2,AN OK sharpener,"THis sharpener does an acceptable job and has the benefit of offering a scissor sharpener, but Victorinox makes a better model. It however is only available at their site or at retailers. I'm using it regularly while the Wusthof stands ignored on my work table."
4,Excellent Product!,"I've tried several different knife sharpeners in my life and I've never come across one so versatile and user friendly as this product! Not only does it sharpen your knives, it also sharpens scissors. It's very easy to use as well, you just hold the non-slip handle onto a steady surface and the grips at the bottom keep it stable while you are sharpening. It only takes a few swipes of the sharpening edge and a couple more of the ceramic refining edge to get my blades sharp enough to split a strand of hair, just like in the cartoons!"
3,"Not the best knife sharpener, but it works for high quality blades","I first tried this on 3 stainless steel crappy hunting/folding knives and saw little to no improvement after 5 strokes each on coarse, then fine. Then I tried it on some high quality carbon steel blades, also 5 strokes each side and noticed a significant difference. The high quality blades, one kitchen knife and one hunting knife (Ka-Bar), were now razor sharp and able to slice paper like a hot knife through butter. Also, when the kitchen knife started to get dull, a few strokes through the fine side of the Wüsthof 2-Stage Knife Sharpener brought it right back to razor sharpness. I'd say if you want to try and bring an old crappy knife back to life, skip this sharpener and go for some something else, maybe some Arkansas sharpening stones. But if you have some high quality blades, then this is a good sharpener."
4,Knife Sharpener,"I used to use a honing wet stone to do my knives and got this as a free gift with another knife set purchase. This is so much cleaner and easier to use and puts a nice sharp edge on my Wusthof Classic knives. You do see the metal filings coming off which means the blades are being trimmed down over time vs. using a wet stone, which just hones the edge, but using the steel keeps things in order for a while. I suggest putting a white paper towel underneath when sharpening so you can see/dispose of the filings. The verdict is still out how long the sharpener itself will remain sharp. I would buy this and recommend it."
4,Lacking Instructions,"The order came promptly, but was lacking the instructions on how to properly sharpen the knives. The product was used and in very good condition. Would have been 5 star review if the instructions were in with the package."
5,Sharp knives ahead,"I'm very pleased with the performance of this sharpener. I've previously tried sharpening my knives with the steel that came with the knives and with a Chef's Choice manual sharpener. The Wusthof sharpener left my knives much sharper than either of those methods. The scissor sharpener feature also worked well on my kitchen shears. There may be ways to get knives even sharper, but I doubt they could beat the price or convenience of this device."
4,A must have in your kitchen,"This is a great sharpener, a must have in your kitchen to keep your knifes in perfect condition. It sharpens the knifes perfectly, keeping them smooth."
3,Good but not great,"Not bad, but a bit overpriced for the quality. Medium quality, sharpening elements fairly small, does a fair job. I think there is likely better value elsewhere, however."
2,Not sure about this one,I'm afraid to use this because after I tried it my knife seemed to get duller. Maybe I'm not using it correctly but shouldn't this be fairly intuitive? I'm afraid to continue using this for now.
3,Not as effective as knife sharpening stone,"I bought this knife sharpener to sharpen my knife set. I originally wanted to buy a sharpening stone, but they were pricey. It's effective for the first couple of weeks, but over time I noticed it made the knife set dull. I tried it with the scissors as well, and it completely dulled the blades. I ended up buying the knife sharpening stone after replacing my knife set."
3,Dunno what to say...,"I am unsure what to say about this product. It was a gift for my mother because she likes my knife sharpener. I thought this one was similar and had the added bonus of being able to sharpen scissors. She did not care much for the product; however, it is possible it is because she is not using it properly. I tried to use it a couple times; however, have not used it enough to give a valid review."
3,Wusthof sharpner.,I don't know how to use Wusthof knife sharpner until yet. I never used this except one trial when I got this from amazon.com. Thank you.
4,Functional,"This has been great for my recently purchased Westhof cooks knife and my older Henkels. This does as advertised, but my daughter says it's not as functional as old style sharpening stick."
5,Simple good design that works for a fair price.,"This sharpener works and it didn't cost me my liver. There are no mechanical or electrical parts, it has a simple design and even a scissors sharpens. Plus Wüsthof is a respected good brand in the knife industry."
5,works great,I like this because its small enough to fit in a kitchen drawer yet it can be quickly pulled out and easily used to sharpen knives as they are needed. It quickly puts a great edge on our knives. This replaces a more expensive electric sharpener but I believe this one is simpler to use (which means it gets used more often) yet still puts a superior edge on our knives.
3,not entirely well made,"While sharpening the first knife on this, one of the ceramic rods began to rotate. By the second knife it was really spinning around, and squeaking. I don't think this is supposed to happen - for one, it would asymmetrically hone the blade. But I don't know for sure, because Wüsthof didn't reply to my email question about it.Well, that problem could be fixed with a bit of superglue. But I really shouldn't have to repair things right out of the box. And something with no moving parts (ignoring the floating rod in the scissor sharpener) should be easily made solid.On the other hand, it seems to work now. My (previously incredibly dull) knives have a new lease on life, and seem moderately sharp. I haven't extensively used any other sharpener (my knives can attest to that), so I don't know how it compares."
5,Love this gadget!,"Maybe the best $20 I've ever spent. If you're like me and your knives are ancient and you're not getting anywhere with the sharpening steel, BUY THIS. You will feel a LOT less sorry for yourself about not having the $$ for new knives. And for godsake do NOT throw out those tarnished old scissors you bought back when we actually manufactured things like scissors in the good old US of A. I've had the nastiest looking pair of scissors imaginable for as long as I can remember, we're talking decades, but they're quality. A few passes through the scissors sharpener in this gizmo and they're performing like new. Thank you, Wüsthof, for providing us with a way to AVOID buying your knives :). Very classy."
2,Worked for a couple months,When I first bought this it really did a good job sharpening my knives. Within a couple months it was dulling my knives more than sharpening them and I went back to my old flat stone. I think the two small stones in this sharpener wear a groove after only a few uses and then the edge of the blade is cutting against part of the stone.
4,"Knife sharpener great, scissor fail","The knife sharpener works great, the scissor sharpener does not function in any appreciable capacity."
4,Good Investment for Kitchen,"This sharpener workes better than I expected. It is reasonably priced, easy to use, and does the job well."
5,A really good purchase for a new knife owner.,"The Crate & Barrel salesperson recommended using the ceramic side often (almost every time you use the knife) and use the course side for when a knife is really dull. She said the course side, ""rearranged the molecules."" haha!"
4,A Must Kitchen Gadget,"The Wusthof 2-stage knife sharpener is a must for any serious kitchen. Better than the electric version it allows the user to apply the correct pressure for each blade type you select. Very sharp knives need the lightest of pressure in the fine honing slots and older dull blades can receive more work in the coarse sharpening slot, making them of greater service. The scissor slot is a bonus. Great gift for foodies."
4,Great value,"I had bought my husband an electric sharpener a few yrs back, as an avid hunter he needed sharp knives. The electric sharpened became a paper weight! I looked for stones but they were all too small for our longer butchering knives. When I saw the name I immediately thought $$$ but it was actually affordable and has worked out great! Our knives are all like brand new! It's not five stars only because it's not the easiest to use for a newbie like me. My husband knew exactly how to hold it but their were no instructions for me. Otherwise the name and quality go hand in hand!"
1,Waste of money,"I don't know if I just got a bad one or what but it does nothing to my knives. I decided to purchase it soley on the great reviews. I have several very nice Wusthof knives that were in need of sharpening. Ordered this sharpen tried it on everyone of of my knives then had two other people try to see if it was just me, the knives are soo dull you can literally run the blade across your hand and it does nothing. Very disappointed in this product.I give it one star for the fact the scissor sharpener worked well."
4,Good tool,"I really like this tol. Actually, I bought a tone sharpner first and it did not work well at all. Then I found this one and gave a try. I am soo happy that this is the right one for my knives and sissors"
2,Piece of Junk,"I waited a month or so to write this review to fully give the Wusthof 2-Stage Sharpener a chance to shine. It did not. For some reason or another, I just can not get the promised sharp edge even though I follow the instructions to a 'T. At nearly $25 this product is not worth the price. Plain and simple, it is a piece of junk. Brand name means nothing. And I use this device to sharpen quality knives such as Wusthoff and Emiril. So much for that."
2,"ok, if you have no other options...","this works if you use it before you cook every time. it wont hold the edge on the knife though. really, youre much better off learning to use a stone and getting a steel."
4,Great tool for the price,"If you're not skilled with a knife steel, this is the next best thing. It's easy, it works and best of all the price is right!"
5,Perfect gift!,My little niece wanted this for Christmas and was thrilled when she received it. Very comfortable and good looking too!
5,"Love, Love, Love this seat!!!","This is a great seat. It is not made out of the material that makes your baby sweat. It is very stylish and cleans up SUPER easy. I love it because of its overall comfort! You can feel your hand sink into the comfort foam, so you can imagine how it feels to your baby. My husband actually bought this seat for me while I was in the hospital after having our sixth child on 2-10-05. I had her a month early and had not picked out a seat yet. His main thing was to get one that was not going to make her sweat like the one we had for our last child did. This seat has an easy to clean pad without making her sweat and she has a head full of hair!!! The mathching stroller is a must have!!!!"
5,What We've Been Waiting for!,My husband and I were thrilled to receive this gift for our shower. We registered for this car seat because of its known brand and its safety mechanisms. We also love the patttern and portability - it's unisex and easy to take in and out of the base.
5,Great Seat,"I really like this chair, especially the memory foam that pads it. My daughter always seems really comfortable and never complains. Although it does seem to be a little too warm for her in the summer months. She always seemed sweaty on her back when I took out in the summer months, but now that it's fall, it keeps her nice and warm. So I guess it depends on when you'd be needing it. Overall, I love it! I just wish my car was compatible with the new LATCH straps which is only in 2002 cars and newer. My husband and I both drive cars previous to that year and have to rely on the seat belt, but it seems to work well enough."
3,I wish I had known,"This seat was great for my daughter for 3 months. I loved the pattern and the foam seemed very comfortable for her. I did like that it came with a cover, but it became more of a pain than anything else. It kept popping off of the handle and detaching. I also hated that she out grew this car seat so soon. The weight limit was fine but height wise she out grew it at 3 1/2 months. For the price I paid I expected to be able to use it longer. As a first time Mom I never thought to look at the height limit of a car seat (which on this one is 26 inches)."
4,More Sticks and Dips,"These little things also use the ""stick and dip"" theme to make a snack that is very more-ish. Basically, I can't stop until I have finished the pack. Like theMeiji - Yan Yan with Chocolate Dip 2.0 Oz., they are not too sweet about the sticks, but the dipping sauce is pretty much loaded with sugar.Again, reading and eating this are not advisable as combined activities, unless you don't mind pink splotches on your books.A great little snack, and a great way to give yourself a sweet pick-me-up with something a little different."
3,"Some good ideas, but not always practical","As a martial artist and shotokan practioner, I have found many of Master Nakayama's books very helpful, such as the Best Karate series. However, this book is NOT one of the more impressive texts. Many of the self-defense applications are helpful and effective, although many senseis with an eye for pratical application of technique to real-life situations can think of as good or better ones. Many of the situations shown in this text are unlikely in terms of oncoming attackers and the moves required from the martial artist. For example, an attacker pointing a handgun at your chest/head from beyond striking distance is not a situation where I would try to make a move against them. So, in summary, there are few helpful items in this text, and the ones that in fact are there are ones that many senseis can teach students from a very common-sense and practical approach."
3,"Low quality Audio CD, Inaccuracy","I bought this book to prepare for the German CLEP Test. I wanted to see what the exam looks like. I sure hope the exam is more accurate than this book is. It is full of mistakes (answer key is not always correct) and some of the questions are not even in the order of the book (see other review). I am a disappointed. I'd think a published book would undergo serious proofreading. It does not seem to be the case. Also the quality of the audio CD is really low, I had to crank out the volume to hear what was on the CD."
1,I can't believe this can be sold!,"I am glad I got asked to do this review. I grew up bi-lingual - English/German. I got this book, because I need to Clep out of some of the german classes for my master's program. It is supposed to help you with grammar and correct usage of german... There are many, many, many spelling and even grammatical mistakes in the sample tests, in the reviews... Furthermore the CD's often don't match up with the book!! Incredible!! The quality of the CD's are often so bad, you can't understand - amateurish at best!!DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
2,not all that great,I would not recommend getting this book to prepare for the CLEP. It just isn't as good as the one offered by the College board which makes the CLEP Tests.
1,Do you know computers?,Be careful with this one. I think the book is good and the CD needs to have a slight modification before it works. When you get it take it to a computer and add <.wmv> to the file names and burn it again as an audio CD then it should work. I bought it because another reviewer said it covers material that shows up in the test. I didn't take the test yet so I don't know.
3,"too much dialoge, not enough music","Surprisingly good find, but not what you might expect. Original soundtrack? Certain songs have been rearranged from a Japanese band. Others are a direct video tranfer, dubbed dialoge and all. John Barry's Game of Death is included, but Joseph Koo's original scores must have gotten lost over the years. Aside from all the dialoge, the film music is exciting. The Japanese band mixes their songs with some of Lee's fighting noises, original in that respect. Enter the Dragon's music is also redone."
4,Very useful product,"The hot/cold that came with my casserole carry split open after several years, so I ordered this replacement. I hope this one lasts a little longer than the first, which didn't see all that frequent use."
2,Not what i expected.,"The item was purchased to replace another hot pack which was slimmer than this one. Instead of this pack containing a thin plastic inner pad, it contains a liquid that makes it act like the surface of a water bed and is much thicker that the original pad that came with the portable casserole."
1,Not Really Happy With New Combo,"Having had the old type of single hot or cold packs with the original Toter, I was not very happy with the liquid type combo of hot/cold together. I like to keep my cold pack frozen for instant use and if I need it for hot it will have to be completely thawed before heating. Why did you change to the combo and do away with the individual cold and hot packs? I thought I was getting one of each when I ordered and instead was unpleasantly surprised by the two in one design. I will not purchase another as I'm rather dissatisfied with the liquid type pack as well as the combo aspect."
4,I like it.,"Haven't used this yet, but I'm sure it works well. Will try it soon. It's nice looking and easy to store."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Fans of Narnia will love Myridia. The reader is transported via an old shed to a magical land of princesses, heroes, talking signs and walking giants made of tools. Experience the loyalty and bravery of three sisters as they set across a strange land to rescue a princess. Relive the feelings of first love. Journey to Myridia is a must read for fantasy fans! - author of Pursued By Evil and A Dream Fulfilled"
3,s l o w,"My wife and I had a ""cheap"" date night at home and I picked this out thinking she'd like it. We both agree that it was cute, but a very slow movie."
4,Leap Year,"This is a well made entertaining movie. It has some really funny parts and is a great PG movie suitable for the whole family. A great find with humor, romance(sort of) and a great storyline. Recommend."
4,a cute Irish chick-flick,I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of my favorites. Both a comedy and a romance.Amy Adams was both cute and funny. Her character was at times annoying but also likeable. The idea to be the one to propose to the boyfriend showed her as being a 21st century woman. But it also showed her as being silly (going to Ireland to propose the day of leap year).Matthew Goode. This guy is a dream. Yes I know he's English playing an Irish character. But he did do a good job at it. He played the part really well. His character had a devil-may-care and anti-relationship attitude. I just loved him.The story-line was unrealistic. The whole falling in love within a matter of a few days was predictable. But it's cute.
5,Leap year.,Excellent movie. Kept your interest the entire time. I loved that they kept the background noise to a minimum so I could understand every word.
5,leap year,"This is a movie we like to watch over and over. Very fond of Amy Adams and love the chemistry between her and Matthew Goode. The scenery was beautiful. If you like a good, clean love story-I suggest you try this one!"
3,Leap Year,It was okay. Seems like a lot of other movies have similar plots... Amy Adams has done better work as well.
1,Recycled,"Tell me if you've seen this story (a thousand times)!(1.) Self centered greed driven young professional sales oriented female.(2.) Trying to marry similar driven male professional counterpart.(3.) Obviously not going to work or make an interesting story.(4.) Female goes on journey to manipulate this bonding.but,(5.) Gets stuck in a series of highly improbable events that result in(6.) Crossing paths with some good looking but unsophisticated country hick, who(7.) Charms/changes her with the beauty of his smelly dirty romantic lifestyle and all it's possibilities, but(8.) She wavers when said professional proposes but in the end it just doesn't stand up to pigs and beer, and(9.) She changes her mind at the alter.Oh, what a unique and creative tale. By the way - acting was, well, cookie cutter drama school stuff but the green rolling hills were nice."
2,Only thats good is the scenery,"(Spoiler) I rented this from Amazon.com bc i normally agree with reviewers here. Not this time...This was a common and terribly written seen it a hundred times attempt at a love story. I am a sucker for those love stories where you know the couple will probably get together at the end. But, it has to be written in such a way where you actually care. I could have just as easily seen this couple ending up being friends and the woman ending up with her original boyfriend. It really absolutley made no difference. And it really wasnt the actors they did fine with the material that they had there was just no substance. Nothing to make you want the couple together or the other couple apart. The only good thing were the beautiful scenes of Ireland."
1,One of 2010's Worst,"It's not good when one of the stars of your film says ""I just know that there are a lot of people who will say it is the worst film of 2010."" Those are the words of Matthew Goode (Amy Adams costar) and boy is he right. The writing, horrible effects (attempting to paste the actors into scenes from Ireland), 1950s plot and clunky acting - wow - this film should never received the green light. What a waste of my time!"
4,Refreshingly Entertaining,"Most importantly, yes I agree with all the critics that hate this movie because it is predictable. But let's all be honest here. Very rarely a movie comes out that you cannot predict with a great deal of accuracy. The betting lines in Vegas are less accurate than the predictability of nearly every movie that comes out. EVERY MOVIE can be called predictable. With that said...Leap Year is refreshingly entertaining. The scenes from Ireland are amazing. The lore of the story is appealing to anyone with a heart. Amy Adams and Matthew Goode are a fantastic pairing for this story.If you are unimaginative and a critical person, do not watch this movie. If you enjoy easy to follow, great scenery that stimulates the story, and a folklore that stimulates the imagination then you will enjoy this movie. In the words of LeVar Burton, ""Of course, you don't have to take my word for it."""
5,"The Best Since ""The Notebook""!",I have seen this movie at least 10 times. Every single viewing rekindles my heart and soul! Can't wait to relive this video again very soon!
3,Great flick,Really enjoyed this movie. Sweet and easy to follow story line. Scenery was amazing! I think people should see it. LOVE Amy Adams!
1,Most un-romantic romantic film EVER!,"This is one time I should have paid attention to the right side (negative) of the reviews. I have been anticipating viewing this film ever since I heard the Maltin pro give it a thumbs up.Went to Redbox to rent it for $1.27 and it's not available in GA. I see why. I was so enchanted with Amy Adams in ""Enchanted"" that I just wanted to see her in another film.The Irish accent from the star was very hard to understand and since AMA will not get subtitles, I had no idea what the male lead was saying. I will still try another Amy Adams film as she is adorable, but this ranked up there with the top five most terrible films I have ever rented and this is saying something because I am a 'movie-olic.'. . .wish I had not spent the $2.99 and a call to AMA to get this film. . . should have listened to my gut."
1,Lame and boring,"This movie was a waste of a talented actress. It is not funny, it is boring, and it makes very little sense. I can see why other reviewers said their 10 year olds liked it. You would have to be 10 to get any enjoyment out of it, and even that is stretching it. I would not recommend it to anybody--it is inoffensive, but it is also a colossal waste of time."
1,I want to gouge my eyes out,"I love romantic comedies and I like Amy Adams. Correction, liked Amy Adams. The plot is unoriginal, the acting is horrible, the characters were flat and there wasn't a single moment that made me laugh. I couldn't even stick around to the end. Amy Adams' character was uptight and unlikable. The Irish guy was rude and the cardiologist boyfriend was annoying. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. I don't usually write reviews, but this one is just THAT bad."
2,Failure after a couple of weeks,"I had gotten this movie back in early part of October and I really havent watched the movie that many times. Well, suddenly the movie would freeze and when it started back up again, the sound was not working. It is not the player because I would put in another movie as soon I got tired of fooling with the movie. It is really odd but I think I may have just gotten a lemon. I'm not going to be the one saying do not buy from this seller cause I had great delivery. It is more of a product failure."
1,Terrible,"This movie was painful to watch. Not one of the characters was likable, the plot was awful, I did not laugh once...the list goes on. Save your money and if you want to watch a cheesy chick flick there are definitely many out there that have more to offer than this."
3,Leap year remake,"I believe this film is a remake (with obvious modifications) of the 1945 British film ""I know where I'm going"" starring Wendy Hiller and Roger Livesey. I can't believe no-one else has seen the obvious similarities between the two films even though Leap Year is set in Ireland and the other one is set in Scotland."
2,Look Before You Leap ...,"And too bad too. The leads are very good and the scenery better, but the story doesn't cut it. This film is essentially a remake of ""It Happened One Night"" that happens to be set in Ireland, and it doesn't stack up with the original--the script just isn't as sharp as it should be.Can't anyone make a romantic comedy anymore?"
2,Most predictable,"I don't understand the appeal for this movie. It was predictable and silly. If you're looking to get away from real life & stress, and want to watch something mind-numbing, this'll do it for you."
3,Cute but Predictable,"This was a fun movie but not without some serious logistical issues. The lead character is flying from Boston to Dublin, Ireland but due to bad weather the plane gets diverted to Wales. After that the geography seems a little off -- she somehow charters a boat to Cork (which is much further south) and again due to bad weather she is dumped by the boat in Dingie -- which is even FURTHER south and far around the island of Ireland.Its also a little hard to believe that the main character, an anal retentive, control everything kind of person, would not better asses her options for getting from Wales to Dublin before setting off on this crazy journey.So if you can over look these pretty major (I think) issues at the start of the movie, the rest of it is fun but predictable."
4,girl flick!!,Loved it!! Had to own it. Its a feel good movie. Amy Adams is great in her role. One good Irish movie.
5,Love it!,"This is a simple yet tastefully done love story. I love the scenery, all the songs, Matthew Goode is sooo handsome in this movie, and Amy Adams she's just adorable and funny. Must watch ! Cheers"
4,Cute,Kept me interested throughout as the flow was crisp. I recommend for young and old as the message applicable to all.
4,there is NO ACTRESS as good as Amy Adams,"As usual, Amy Adams does more with a character than one could imagine any other actress doing. This was a very enjoyable film (my favourite part was when he laughed at her with his mouth full of food while driving). It has just a few creaky moments (i.e the wedding shoe scene), but I LOVED that it didn't have overt sexual behaviour or violence or foul language which seems to mar so movies these days (and has ruined most Jude Law film roles for me -- what a waste of talent there). Amy Adams is charming and Matthew Goode manages to put much naturalness into a role that could have fallen quickly into the stereotypical. Goode manages to keep the romantic lead firmly grounded in a masculine ethos. Leap Year is a film most women will want to enjoy more than once, and most men will find watchable at least once. (And yes, it helped me to figure out what I would save if my home was on fire.) Very charming gem of a film."
2,Disappointed,"The title of this movie should have been ""Lame Year"" and not ""Leap Year"". Disappointed as both my husband and I love Amy Adams. She made a mistake on this one."
3,"Nice romantic, funny movie","I reneted this movie while I was ic moviin bed sick and it was one of those quirky, romantic, funny movies that you just woudl watch every time it comes on. Amy Adams is always good to watch and I thought the ending was quite sweet....."
2,Good Movie but Poor Quality,"I thought the movie was cute, however, the quality of the movie was terrible. I have fast internet but the movie still skipped every 30 seconds and the whole movie was blurry."
2,"Puts you right too sleep,LOL","Did anyone really expect this to be anymore than an average romantic comedy? I no i sure didn't. I even expected that it would be unoriginal. Most romantic comidies are. However, none of this makes up for the fact that this movie gets it all wrong. Lets start off with the casting. Amy Adams should never be considered a leading lady. She has a quirky awkwardness about her that never seems to work. Some actresses have this genre down packed (Kate Hudson-Katherine Heigl) and some never will. I felt sorry for Matthew Goode because his performace was actually pretty good. Sorry, this film is not very entertaining. In the scenes that should be funny it seems like the actors are not trying hard enough. I hate to repeat myself but Amy Adams ruined this already unfunny little flick. This one gets 2 THUMBS DOWN. Don't even waist your time renting this one. You've already seen this story before. You just couldn't recognize it because now it sucks."
2,"Ehhh, kinda sucks.","A so-so love story with good looking people, beautiful shots of Ireland, and a story you really never fall for. At no point does your heart break and make you think ""I hope they end up together."" you instead think, oh well, if they do great, but I don't see why. After a garbled mess of a patch work story, and losely based writing format of conflict, climax, resolution, you finally get a bit of back story. Not that it adds up to anything, bad stuff happens, good stuff happens, and then well, it ends, and you don't feel any differently than when it started. Stick with P.s I love you, or Enchanted if your hankering for a good love story with Amy Adams. This one, won't leave you caring one way or another if there is a happy ending."
2,Movie,Great Movie. DVD worked without a problem. The case was broken upon arrival. I was suspicious that the DVD had been previously viewed as the broken pieces of the case were not in the plastic wrap.
3,Cute,"Cute movie, but not a great movie. Totally predictable plot and not much chemistry between the two, but Matthew Goode is just nice on the eyes!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"Not my kind of movie, I gave it to a friend who loved it. Passing it on was a good thing"
2,French Kiss in Ireland,"This movie is very similar to the Meg Ryan/Kevin Kline movie, French Kiss, except the location is Ireland instead of France. Girl flies to foreign country to bring back/marry the man she loves/meets a sarcastic, cute-but-bitter foreign guy/ travels around on madcap adventures with him/ has her suitcase stolen/ foreign guy threatens thief to get the case back/ fnds the guy she went searching for/ doesn't want him anymore/ stays with/goes back to the foreign guy. Even the scene in the car with the lead man making fun of her 'plan' is almost identical. Oh, and the shower scene, too. Meg and Kevin were much more believable and comedic."
4,Superb,Great movie for a date night at home with my husband. We both enjoyed the comedy and I may have teared up...
2,Bad movie,"I did not like this movie at all. So cheesy. The guy is really cute though. But yeah, I did not finish the movie and probably will not seek it out again."
4,Awww...,"If you're looking for a cute movie to watch, this is it. :)Not an Oscar winner by any means, but like I said, it's about what you're looking for / in the mood for."
4,Funny and romantic,I enjoyed watching this movie. Something you and your date can watch at home on a rainy day:)
5,Perfect escapist movie,Great fun and beautiful scenery. What more could you want from a romantic comedy?
4,Cute,"I really didn't think I would like this movie but I was wrong! Yes, it is a little cheesy at parts and it's pretty predictable but it's a really cute movie that you can enjoy with the whole family. If you're looking for a lighthearted movie that will give you a few smiles, this is the one for you."
3,Nice Escape,"Even though this movie went unnoticed in the theaters it did provide a nice escape from the dull-drums of daily life. yes, the story line is not that original; but I was not expecting to watch something on the scale of Out of Africa. It is your basic rom-com that entertains. I definitely think Amy Adams does a terrific job in her role and she definitely makes the movie. She has an amazing ability in playing these parts without making the character seem too ""cutesy."" The added bonus is the cinematography of Ireland; definitely makes for an amazing video tavel brochure. So don't over analyze the script or the storyline; just sit back and enjoy the ride."
2,Too predicable. Characters not appealing.,"This is about the most predictable, contrived, unoriginal romance movies I've seen.The only reason to see this movie is Amy Adams and the Irish scenery.[Spoilers:]Her main Irish love interest is unappealing at the beginning and doesn't completely improve by the end. Their early animosity quickly becomes tedious, then continues throughout too much of the movie.In fact, all the Irish people in the movie get rather poor portrayals. The Irish people I've known were more friendly than those you see in this movie.I found it rather incredulous that the Amy Adams character would fall for such a rude and unromantic guy. He softens a little but even in practically the last scene he still calls her an idiot, even if in jest. If I were a woman I wouldn't be impressed with this guy, even after understanding his reasons."
2,Luckily leap years only happen every four years!,"Haven't I seen this movie before??? Not very original and far less cute. Also required huge ""leaps"" in the suspension of disbelief. I knew it would be fluff--but this was less of a distraction and more of an insult."
2,Leap Year,"The movie was trite and boring, so much so that I fell asleep half way through. I love Amy Adams and was so disappointed that she chose this film, clearly for the money, not the quality of the script or what it could do to strengthen her portfolio. Snoooooooozzzzzzzzze...."
5,LOVE IT!,"Always and forever will I love this movie...it always makes my heart feel so warm and fuzzy when I watch this. Also, it's hilarious. You should buy it!"
4,Movie you can enjoy with your daughter,"I was so happy to find a romantic comedy that I could enjoy with my 11 year old daughter. We both loved it! Beautiful shots, great acting and fun story...nice, clean, romantic fun!"
4,"Sweet, Light, Romantic","This movie was so enjoyable. The chemistry between the two actors is wonderful. Matthew Goode is fantastic, which surprised me because I didn't like him in Brideshead Revisited (although I didn't like much about that movie). This movie is sweet and light and romantic. It's an easy thing to criticize -- romantic movies -- but there aren't that many good ones made each year. It's a hard thing to get just right, even simple, light love stories. This movie manages it well."
5,Very Entertainment! Joyful!,"It is a very heart warming story. The soundtrack just sets the movie in the right mood. Even though it has a somewhat predictable ending, it has some twists of its own, make the movie not like some kind of cliche of movies of same genre from the past. Recommended!"
4,I love TI in general,"I love how it shows you in ""type"" format what exactly you are typing into the calculator. That way, if I lost track of where I was in my checkbook, I would take a look at the last two entries and figure out where I was. And I have to say TI is all I've ever used since high school... It's good and dependable. If I hadn't lost the previous one, I would have continued to use it til it died (not likely in the near future) or broke."
3,Ok in a weird sort of way,"I enjoyed ""The Slumber of Christianity"" and won't tell you not to read it, however, I don't think this book will serve the purpose which the author originally intended. Let me explain.The stated purpose of the book is help Christians wake up from their ""slumber"", which is described as a lack of desire to be in Heaven (enjoying Christ forever). Dekker goes to great length to show how so many real Christians he knows don't desire Heaven as they should, indeed, as the Bible says they would.And that is where I think Dekker is off track. To put it simply, most of the people he describes aren't true Christians who just need to ""wake up from their slumber"", but false converts (fake Christians) who need to come to know Jesus Christ for the first time!How can you know Jesus Christ for who He really is and not desire to be with Him for eternity? You can't. If you don't desire to be with Him, then you do not know Him. Its very simple, really."
5,Amazing!,"This book totally changed my life, the way I view God and modern man. I have enjoyed Ted Dekker for years as a novelist and it was amazing to read his insights in Slumber. I've given lots of copies of this book away and wanted it on Kindle to carry it everywhere :)"
5,EXCELLENT,This book has certainly changed my way of thinking about life and heaven. I didn't think I was in a slumber before I read this book but now I feel fully awakened and I'm yearning for heaven. A must read!!
5,The Slumber of Christianity,"The book content mirrored my feelings about where christianity is headed . Satan has dulled peoples minds. Churchto a lot of people seems to have become a chore. People have created their own high places to worship. Their cars,their large homes fancy vacations. They have let too many things get in the way of God, going to church and justplain worship. Christians need to wake up to reality before it is too late. Soon it may be too late. God will notbe mocked. He is to be obeyed"
4,Wake up,This book makes you think. It is very well written. This is one book that I am sharing with others.
4,Great Worship and Praise,Kurt Carr is awesome! I have several of his cd's. He has been blessed with an abundance of talent and gifts.
4,OK a little hard to read.,"Not to say I don't like Manhunt, I love it, it is a little hard to read the stratagy guide. The pictures are itty-bitty and are inpossible to read.Pros:tells a lot about the game.cons. itty-bitty pictures."
3,Rock and Roll,"This is an interesting album because of it honesty. I bought the album at a live show in a dive bar in South Baltimore. The lead singer Mike D. truly looks the part of the bands name. The live show was a greasy hard rocking show with political leanings and an occasional ballad.The album is very similar to the live show, you can see the Drive by Truckers influence, but the band still maintains its own identity. While Mike D. has a powerfully voice it seems a little over used at times, relying too heavily on the power and forgetting about the quality. The songs are well written overall, but the lyrics seem a little forced a times.I would recommend this album and checking out a live show. This band works hard and is a real rough and tumble rock and roll band. No pretty boys here just ugly rockers!"
2,A confusing episode worth nothing but seawater,"The idea of a man obsessed with obtaining the formula to extractgold from seawater is a rather silly idea, regardless of how manyguest stars are used to get one to view this fumbling two-parter.Save the money from not buying it for some fine Japanese cuisine."
2,A kooky episode,"These 2 agents are sheer bumblers who get their butts kicked around by martial experts. Bad enough they get chased all over the world and still can't handle themselves worth a damn. Watch, laugh, then dump it!"
5,An incredible album by an amazing band!,Emerson Drive is an amazing band and this album is filled with heart warming songs that touch the soul. You can't help but sing along to songs that speak of true American family values with traditional country flare!
4,GOTHIC THRILLER,AN OLD ONE THAT i READ YEARS AGO AND IT HASN'T LOST IT'S CHARM TODAY ALSO GREEN DARKNESS by ANYA SETON is a keeper
1,Terminate this soundtrack,This score is just a symptom of a bad movie. Beltrami has done better music in the past (The Crow: Salvation) but this is a farce of the the original score mastered by Brad Fiedel.The original theme is used once - during the end credits - and Beltrami seemed almost embarrassed to interpret it as the music comes across sounding like a low-end keyboard played through a Sparkomatic AM radio. The entire score is irrelevant to the film and sounds like a jarbled collaboration of techno nonsense.Avoid it even at a used price.
4,"It's not Brad Fiedel, get over it","While Brad Fiedel will always be the true musical voice of the Terminator; Marco Beltrami (who composed the scores to the Scream trilogy, Joy Ride, Mimic, and Resident Evil with Marilyn Manson) does a fine job with scoring this overhauled installment of the Terminator series. Replacing Fiedel's synth-laced score with a more conventional metal themed score, Beltrami has conceived an above average film score that falls short of it's predecessor's, but just like the new film, succeeds in it's own right. The first half of the disc is excellent, but begins to lose steam before picking up again with a brief re-imagining of Fiedel's classic awe-inspiring Termiantor theme. The last two songs are totally out of place here, and are absolutely worthless in terms of having to do with the film. Besides that, this is worth owning for any Terminator fan."
4,Pianist review,It makes clear and loud tones which I can hear over my practice timer. It seems to be a tough unit.
3,"Metronome, was it worth it?","Not being a professional musician, just a long-time amateur trumpeter since age 5 (next birthday will be dozen that), I wanted to replace the previous one, also a well used digital which I had for several years, and showing its age. This new one is good, and with the few features it comes with, still too many for me. All I need is a simple metronome to keep beat for me. There is no need for 2:4, 3:4, etc. Rarely, if ever, will it come handy. I guess when it does, it will be there, the once in a decade. The clicking sound is LOUD. Not screaming, screeching loud, but definitely loud, and can well be heard over the trumpet. Well, at this age, with hearing and sight deteriorating, it's OK, I guess. Will I buy it again? Probably not, and, than, again, it's not worth the hassle to return. Let it run its usefulness, and in the next few years decide what to do. Maybe just sell the trumpet altogether."
3,What?,How do I? rate this cd ? I have never heard it! Because you can't buy anywhere That's why greetings piet
5,American Beauty,"Epic in sweep, but overall an intimate story of an aging corrupt politician's final days of glory as he confronts the suicide of a close friend, a bittersweet resumption of a longed-for love, the fall of his political machine, a particularly acrimonious child custody case, and his own mortality.William Kennedy's seventh novel of his Albany series is full of sublime prose, beautifully rendered characters who are oddly sympathetic despite their less-than-wholesome tendencies, and a pervasive aura of unmistakeable sadness.This is the first novel in this series I've read, and while there are references galore to characters and plots from previous novels, I had no difficulty following or appreciating what was developing here.Surely to be one of the finest novels published in 2002."
2,More of the Same,"Having read the original ""Albany Trilogy,"" I knew what to expect from William Kennedy. ""Ironweed"" was by far the best. Roscoe is number seven in what has moved from a trilogy to a ""series."" For me the series has gotten old. More of the same characters, strange relationships, and unique writing. If you like Kennedy's writing style and other books, there is no reason you would not like this one. I, however, found this one to be a tired retread of the same formulae Kennedy used in his earlier works.In Roscoe, the main character is another Albany pol who skirts the line between illegality and legality while fostering the political machine's criminal element. The character is not very believable and certainly not sympathetic. His relationships are even less believable.I should have stopped with Ironweed. I will not go back to numbers four through six of the series."
2,Not Kennedy's best,"Granted this book is well-researched and well-written, but I cannot say that I could not put it down. In fact, I did put it down. Several times. I even stopped halfway through and read another novel, then finished this one. The main characters of this novel are all corrupt politicians, and I found it hard to muster sympathy for corrupt politicians. I just did not care what happened to them. Further, the writing of the subplot about the relationship between Roscoe and his love Veronica was uninspired. In fact, I thought most of the scenes involving the two of them read like a cheap romance paperback.I loved Kennedy's book ""Ironweed"" which dealt with the outcasts of Albany's society. This book deals with the insiders of Albany's society. Perhaps this story would have best been left as backstory for other, more engaging, characters."
3,A minor addition to the Albany cycle,"Roscoe, is a political fixer for the Albany political machine. In this novel, we see his life in bits and pieces, bouncing from his misspent youth to the rather bizarre custody battle he becomes part of as an attorney; dealing with his ex-wife, his former love and the child, or not, of his best friend, who has committed suicide...you get the picture. There's a lot going on here. Actually there is too much. So many minor characters take up your time and you get constantly pulled into their lives and away from the fascinating world of early Albany politics. The amazing tales of power struggles and ""fixing"" things the right way are watered down by tales of unrequited love to the detriment of this book. Not a constantly intriguing tale as many of the others in this series and while it's a good read, it pales in comparison with some of Kennedy's other works."
1,Cheap cash-in on Linkin Park's success,"I bought this DVD when I first discovered and went nuts over Linkin Park. I had already bought all of their albums up to that time and the Pancake Festival DVD. I quickly scooped up this DVD when I discovered it at the mall but was sorely disappointed once I watched it. There is barely any Linkin Park footage, and none of their music. It's merely others bands and other people talking about Linkin Park. It'd be okay if the bands were worth mentioning but unfortunately they aren't. This feels like a cheap way to cash in on Linkin Park's success and I suggest avoiding this DVD."
3,Not what I expected...,"I am always looking for new information that I can use to help those beginning recovery.Almost all of the people I deal with are skeptics of one kind or another and anythingthat might expand my perception and communication with them is always helpful.Though the title implies it, this is not that type of book.It is yet another (very) common story along the lines of what you hear at any 12 step meeting.There seems to be nothing addressing the issues of the real skeptics and I hear this tired droll all too oftenby the ""born-again"" AA-er that breezes through nine steps superficially and learns they can make money off it.There are a million of these books and this one is nothing special, however,I would not condemn it as another ""Million Little Pieces (of you know what)""It's a nice common story that might help someone,but for the money your better off buying a subscrition to the Grapevine."
1,not as complete as expected,There seems to be very little in the book about ground support operations! So that's kind of A to about M....for maintenance which is covered by less then one page!!!Greg
2,Print the PDF,There are better choices for getting started with Pagemill. I got a copy with my iMac and wanted a printed manual. I had no experience with web pages. The VQS guide lost me on image placement and resourse folders. I recommend printing the PDF manual and doing the included tutorial.
3,A good reference book but that is all.,I was disappointed in the book because though there is a great deal of information in it there was nothing in there to show how to integrate it. I believe the book should have contained tutorials which show the steps in the creation of a web page from start to finish with references to the various chapters each step of the way. This would teach the methodology of web page design. I have found that this a common problem with most computer books.
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed, and at times, actually annoyed. Though the material is laid out in an easy-to-access manner, the writing is incredibly dry - not that one expects to be entertained, but one does expect the presentation to be engaging. I also found the constant repetition of commands to be very annoying (their excessive usage only served to slow down the flow of information), as was the author's constant note, ""I will tell you more about it later."", at every turn. This is not a book I would recommend, which is unfortunate, since one covering PageMill 3 is definitely needed."
3,So-so,"This IS an important contribution to literary theory. The points that Lakoff and Turner make are very good, very logical, and will make you go ""Of course! Why didn't I think of that?"" It will not only change the way you read poetry, but will impact the way you watch t.v., listen to people speak, read the newspaper - any endeavor involving language. Why the low rating, then? Lakoff and Turner are structuralists, and they repeat everything over and over again, breaking things down to their minute building blocks. They made a very convincing argument in the first chapter, I thought, and didn't need to keep going the way they did. The third chapter, in which they apply their theory to a William Carlos Williams poem is also very good. Those two chapters would have sufficed. Again, an important book, but rather boring at times."
1,"WE ordered a 36"" squeegee but received 24"" inch!","WE ordered a 36"" squeegee but received 24"" inch!Then when we looked on what we had ordered - the product description said 24.2"" even though the title said 36"" Squeegee. Please correct our order and change your item description!"
3,Don't expect to learn anything new,Deepak Chopra's audio book made me feel good for a few minutes but besides that it didn't do much for me. He talks in the abstract constantly about heart and spirit. He also talks about the Vedas and other ancient religious books but it's all to abstract. In the end I didn't understand anything new.
2,Confused,"What they call stylistic fireworks, a totally dislocated non-linear narrative jumping between reality (perhaps), dream (certainly), and metaphor (I think). Less redemption than ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"", and less action too, but a similar level of bleak despair."
1,Hating Paradise by a.l. Kennedy,"This book was selected by a member of my book club. I consider myself an avid, comprehending reader, but this book totally floored me from page one. I finally figured out that the main character was in a black out which caused the non-sense verbage on the pages to be as they were. It was a disgusting drunkalog. I did not care for the lack of plot, endless descriptions of being wasted and doing insane things, and floating from reality to blackout througout the pages.Thank goodness it was a short book. I threw it in the basket on the way out of the restaurant after our book discussion. None of the ladies in the club, except the selector of this book, cared for the book. There are too many great books out there to read and so little time to read all of them.This just was not my choice of literature. It was a waste of time for me to read such debased verbage. Yuck."
4,Ugly doll - two sided,I really love the ugly doll collection. I had it as part of my baby shower price is right and my cousin said that it was priceless because she thought I made it myself for my baby!
3,double sided,it should be cleared that it is double sided not two dolls. they are cute (others are much cuter though).
3,Works great except...,For the plastic part inside base. It is where the handle screws in to this plastic receptor inside the metal housing on the squeegee part. It just is made of cheap plastic and breaks easily. The squeegee works fantastically well however.
1,not worth the money,the stick got separeted from the squeegee so soon after arriving. Paid too much money. Got a cheap squeegee with plastic handle that does the job!I regret the Wipe N Dry FLR Squeegee purchase !
4,Good Buy,"This is exactly what I need for my 2 golf sets. The design is well built, no problem to put 2 sets on this rack."
3,do not fill all the way,"I bought this saver tote to eliminate my sons clothing clutter. I did not over fill the bag. I was able to close it without a problem. But I guess because the clothing takes up more space and less air, the bag did not deflate into the tote like it is supposed too. It did get much smaller than when it started, but it is about twice the size of the tote. I am happy because I was able to get all his clothing in one spot but I won't be able to stack anything on top of it now.I guess if someone was going to put puffy things in it (like blankets or pillows), then it would be able to smush them into the tote."
5,Wonderful cd,"The music and performance are captivating, soothing ,and comforting to the mind. Beautifully done. A must listen."
5,The apple most definitely doesn't fall far from the tree!,"If one were to fill a MUSICAL time capsule, then ""Unforgettable: With Love"" would be placed in it. Not only is the album does the album pay tribute to one of the all-time greats of music, Cole's father Nat, but it is a multiple Grammy-winner that appealed to fans of many genres.Cole is very effective singing the standards made famous by her father and realizes that his stamp is emblazoned on most of them. She never tries to imitate him, just offers her own spin on such gems as ""Mona Lisa,"" ""Smile,"" ""Straighten Up and Fly Right,"" ""Nature Boy,"" and ""Our Love is Here to Stay.""Of course, no musical collection would be complete without the landmark and one-of-a-kind (at the time) pairing of father and daughter on ""Unforgettable.""The song is just as the title says and worthy of the praise it has garnered since its release.I can't believe that I didn't buy this album sixteen years ago.Where was my brain???"
1,Sadly,"Sadly, as yet I have not received the item. A replacement is being sent.Oct 26, 2011I will submit a review as soon as received"
4,Keeps the wife intertained,I got this c.d. for my wife and she hasn't stopped playing it yet. She had this c.d. before and played it until she wore it out.
4,strong Curtis film,"I would ignore the obvious spamming for ""dead central"" as the host there is trying to drum up hits for his website.Good movie - alot to offer horror fans."
3,"It's overated as a whole, but the last story is pretty good.","I recently got this movie, at just over $5. I mean usually this movie is listed at prices that range from no less than $40 and all the way up as high as $70,$80 or maybe even $100, if you can believe that. I will tell you that the movie is nowhere worth that! The first stoty about the car is like a Twilight Zone episode mixed with a little Lifetime original movie feel to it. In other words it's not good! The second about the vampire thing is really odd, until the end, when it comes clear what's really going on. It's an ok story, I guess. The third about the little boy is pretty good. It has some really creepy moments in it. If not for the third story it would not be worth watching ever again. I give the first story a 1 out 5, the second a 2 out 5, and the third a 4.5 out of 5. As a whole the movie gets a 3 out of 5, mainly because the last story saves what would have been a not so good movie ."
3,If You Liked Trilogy of Terror...,"People who like horror anthologies should enjoy this made for TV feature. In 1975 Trilogy of Terror was a success so Dan Curtis directed this follow up although it is not as well known. There are three stories about a trip into the past involving an antique car, a vampire and a woman who brings her drowned son back from the dead. A cast of familiar faces include Ed Begley Jr, Anjanette Comer, Horst Bucholz, Patrick Macnee, Elisha Cook Jr, Joan Hackett and Lee H.Montgomery."
2,Dread Central review!,"Dead of Night isn't terrible, but really it's only something Curtis or Matheson completists should pursue. There's just not a helluva lot to recommend here...Read the whole review at DreadCentral.com!Dead of Night"
3,"damone, ""from the attic""","i first heard of (and saw) when they opened for the ataris/fsf/juliania theory- and i was impressed. i picked up a demo, because it was free. i got vasquez (i believe he's one of the guitarists) to sign it- pretty schweet.anyways, i got 'from the attic' the other day. It's interesting music; in the respect that, it's completely sellout with terrible lyrics- however, it is also good fun. The fact is, this band is already the best of the poser punk genre for one simple reason: they know that they're in a sellout genre. so, instead of trying to deny it..., they just embrace it, and have a good time. And you can feel it. it's got a bit louder sound to it, which is nice. like i said, the lyrics are complete rubbish. but hey, it's fun to listen to- and noelle has a fairly decent voice.and hey, if you guys arent sure, get it anyway. it'll be on the cheap rack. i got it for [inexpensive] at [a local store]...it's fun stuff."
3,Depends on what your looking for...,"Well I bought this album used after seeing the video for ""Frustrated Unnoticed"" on MTV. It's not bad, though it wasn't anything special to me. The lyrics are lacking, mostly sound like a thirteen year old skateboarder wrote them. That's not always a bad thing, but I was hoping for more I guess.Overall, I'd get it used if you can."
2,The book fell apart,The book was a great book dispite the pages falling apart and me having to staple them together. I was kind of upset about that but after i attatched all the pages together and read the book I was feeling better.
5,the truth is a powerful weapon,"To oppress a people you have to suppress, or at least deny, its history. The oppression of Afro-Americans is no exception to this law. In a 1965 speech, as well as in selections from his Autobiography and other works, Malcolm X uncovers the real record of Africa, the slave system, neocolonialism, and what they mean for Blacks today. This book tells you a great deal why those who defended the political and economic status quo hated Malcolm X so much, and why youth seeking to fight that system see him as such an example."
3,Blue Angel,"Different version of Dave Cousins' 1972 classic song. I like both equally although this version is slightly longer & has a different arrangement. It is the best song on the album & as another reviewer said it is worth the price of the CD. As someone else said a long time ago, ""they don't write songs like this anymore"". All I can say is, it is our loss."
4,Classic textbook,"I acquired the textbook because it is used in a HR course. Only read two chapters so far, language sometimes confusing, but very good use of examples and lawsuit cases."
3,Typical college book,"The shipping was decent. The book is a little biased and probably differs from previous versions. Well written book but I just feel like the people who wrote it, wrote it with their personal views in mind."
4,Managing Human Resources,Needed this for a text book for Human Resource Management Class. I found it to be relevant and interesting for the most part and would recommend it as a class text.
3,Dictionary?,"I was disappointed in the size and scope of this dictionary. Although it is on my shelve, I seldom use it. For me, it was a waste of money."
4,More Kochalkisms,"The Perfect Planet is a pleasure to read. Kochalka's artwork is always clever, his storylines are original but emotionally accessible and his always interesting focus on love and lust mixed with a deliberate childish feel make this book, like so many others, fascinating and much more than a one-shot thrill read. Unlike so many other comix writers, I frequently find myself rereading his work and discovering some new emotional undercurrent or some new moment that catches my eye. Bravo."
2,"Prolific, but a bit overrated","The Perfect Planet & Other Stories probably would have worked better if it had just been the Perfect Planet. In the first (and best) of three long stories, James imagines himself inhabiting a world inhabited by robotic versions of the people he knew as a child. His interactions with these robots is intended to give us some deeper understanding of our humanity. It works on some level, even if the only real conclusion we arrive at is that people are mean-spirited jerks who don't deserve to live. The second tale, a meandering non-adventure featuring James and his wife, their talking cat, and a misunderstood snowflake, never really gets off the ground, and the third story, about a frog, a fly and a malevolent toadstool, reads like Jon Lewis' late, great True Swamp after about a dozen bong hits. Kochalka is certainly prolific, but a thin idea is a thin idea whether it takes two pages to complete or twenty. As with many of his comics, this one left me thinking ""That's it?""."
3,"Okay, but not what I expected...","For some strange reason, I assumed that this would somehow be a collection of Snoop Instrumentals. EHHHHHH....WRONG. What we have hear is a collection of instrumental dancehall dub tracks inspired by some of Snoop's classics. Somewhat of a unique blend of dub and g-funk, but it could've been alot better. This is one for open minded listeners, because if you're expecting that Death Row/Neptunes/Dr. Dre/213/Warren G flavor...it aint there.Good release though. ~*REDD*~"
5,great,"exactly what I wanted, I bought for a gift, person I bought for liked it very much, thank you kindly"
2,Spolin Is Better Than NyQuil !,"After reading the first page of Spolin's first chapter I was intrigued. Several pages later, I was sound asleep. I attribute this to the fact that Viola Solin, when she's theorizing, writes like Immanuel Kant tripping on acid. This was especially discouraging, since I had just finished reading Audition by Michael Shurtleff, which is the most clearly written and insightful book on acting anyone could ever ask for.Skimming the exercise descriptions, I found some of them tedious (""Play a salesman with only your calves!"") and some of them risible (""Scream with your elbow!""). Also, her chapter on Emotion seems to contradict the entire Method acting tradition, which, thankfully, she is in no danger of overthrowing.I'm sure that there are some useful points that this book makes, or might make through its exercises, if I cared to try them. But thanks to Spolin's soporific word-salad, her points are a pleasure to miss."
4,Physical Theater,"Very good, I am from México and can read it and apply it in my teachings. I specialize in physiscal theater and I still can grab allot of exercises from it."
5,The last record of Ray!,"It's sad to think about the death of Ray Gillen, He was one of the greatest singer of rock of all time, but the life goes on.....These are the last tracks recorded by Ray.We will remember......"
3,The Ray Gillen portion is not enough to save it.,"Sun Red Sun with Ray Gillen was great. Hard Life, Outrageous, Lock Me Up, and I Know A Place are good. The rest are not."
1,Didn't work on any of my PCs or Laptops,Garbage product. Got a bunk CD that my computer could not run. Checked and double-checked with all these other CD's and DVD's and they worked perfectly. I was basically screwed.
3,Not great,"My grandkids didn't enjoy this much, not sure why... maybe just because I couldn't explain how to use it."
3,Boring,"I bought this for my six year old daughter, who is already reading. She found it very boring. I believe the CD-rom is geared more for four year old pre-readers."
1,NOT for Newer Computers!!!,"If you have a computer that is newer than 2006, do not buy this product. The software is very old and is a pain in the rear! We bought it for my son for Christmas not realizing what we were getting ourselves into. We threw it in the trash."
2,Buyer Beware,This product is not compatible with Windows 7. The listing said it was compatible with Windows and didn't mention this major limitation.
2,bad news!,2 of the 4 products I purchased would not even load onto the computer. very unhappy and will not buy from this company again!!
2,Older learning game ~ daughter not interested...,My daughter played this game for a little while and didn't play it much afterward.. This is an older learning game.
2,Does NOT work with Apple OSX,"I bought this game which states it works with Apple OSX when fact that it only works in 'classic' (OS 9) on the Mac OS. I had to install OS9 on a secondary hard drive to get this to work and it only works marginally at best. It's slow and often produces an ""Out of Memory"" Error even though I've got about 288MB of RAM on my system. I have no idea why don't make a true OSX version, since it's been out for 7 years now! My son does seem to like the games on here, but most Apple equipment can't even run OS9 now so it's almost worthless. Not recommended for OSX users."
4,great book recommend!,"Had this book on my amazon wish list for many months, I actually came acrossed it at a book fair and had to buy it! Very thick book must have any canning recipe known. Recommend for those ready to do some serious canning ;)"
3,Tons of Fights - Very Little Else,"The production values for these shows is incredibly low. Poor camera angles and very poor audio. In fact, audio in the first DVD is nearly unbearable. Comparing these shows to a Pride or UFC show is like eating at a high end restaurant and then eating a meal made in an Easy Bake Oven.HOWEVER, there are TONS of fights, with no preamble. You can see as many as 4 fights in the span of 5 minutes. No interviews, entrances, just fights. Plus, you get to watch Herb Dean fight."
4,Sunbeam works,"This little thermometer is great.It does what I need it to do.I am an avid homebrewer and need to make sure my mash stays at the proper temp.And this is the style that is accurate for brewing.Don't buy a Probe typew meat thermometer and think it will measure correctley in boiling water.Because it won't, No matter how much you pay for it.Unless you get a calibrated model that you can calibrate.This is completley accurate."
1,It was not what I ask for.,The CD is not what I ask for. The seller misled me. He sent a CD with a similar title and never answer my e-mails.
4,Wonderful alone or with another book,"This book has some great photos from the 1964 World's Fair, including the pavilions, monuments and even the transportation used there. Each photo is almost a window into what it was like to be there. very interesting background on the fair too, although by no means very deep. It probably could have used more photos of some of the exhibits and a map might have been helpful, but overall a great book. Very good supplement if you are reading other material on the World's Fair."
4,Interesting,Purchased this book as a gift for someone who grew up near and attended the fair as a teenager. Wonderful pictures and description of the event. Good price too!
1,Disappointing,"I find it interesting that a person with the credentials of the author could offer a book of this caliber. The learning examples contain numerous errors. The answers to the exercises contain numerous errors. It appears to me that this book was written by a researcher, rather than by someone with an education in English grammar. I did find a replacement book that I highly recommend. It is a book providing a thorough and sound foundation in English grammar through sentence diagramming. It is clearly written, comprehensive, and easy to understand. It is ""Grammar by Diagram"" by Cindy L. Vitto."
2,Helpful but flawed,"The book is a helpful refresher for those of us who remember sentence diagramming but have forgotten some of its nuance. I have been using it to teach a 14-year-old high school student some basic grammar that she never learned in grammar school! In particular, sentence diagramming as depicted in this book have helped her to see the differences between pronouns in the nominative case and pronouns in the objective case. Having learned to diagram prepositional phrases, she can better understand why, for example, it is wrong to say, ""Just between you and I,"" or ""Give it to Mary and I."" Nevertheless, the author is distressingly ignorant of the meaning of passive voice. Her misunderstanding is fundamental and detracts from an otherwise good book, which explains why the books earns only two stars. I am hoping the next edition will remedy the passive voice misunderstanding."
2,Lots of errors,"I am only on page 9, but have already found a lot of problems (answer key not matching workbook, etc). Looking for another one as I write this."
5,Putting Rules to Grammar,"Grammar has always seemed more like an art than a science to me. There are many rules that do not always make logical sense. The technique of sentence diagramming allows you to apply logic to the rules of grammar. This allows you to graphically represent exactly what a sentience means.One very nice feature of the book is an extensive glossary. This defines well over one hundred grammar terms. Don't remember what a prepositional phrase or gerund is? The book's glossary will tell you!The book teaches by example, which is very important for sentence diagramming. There are many example sentences in the book, all diagrammed. The book begins with simple sentences and progressively moves on to more complex ones.If you want a better understanding of English grammar, or need a study aid for sentence diagramming, this is a very good book."
5,What a Great Resource!,"I discovered this book in an educational store and purchased it and the author's other grammar book, TROUBLESOME GRAMMAR. I can't begin to say how helpful these two books are. And I can't begin to express how grateful I am to Professor Hayes for writing both books. Please do more! These two books by Dr. Hayes are unbelievably inexpensive and yet so, so worthwhile! She made everything in the books easy to understand, and my students had fun doing the exercises."
2,Grammar & Diagramming Sentences (Advanced Straight Forward English Series),The booklet is too concise to cover this subject. I do not find good value in it. There are a few much better Grammar Diagramming books out there. This book is the least effective one.
4,Grammar & Diagramming Sentences,"I was glad to have the opportunity to view parts of the book with the ""Look Inside"" feature before purchasing. I was able to see the grammar and sentence diagramming explained by the books author."
2,Move along..nothing to see here!,"This collection sounds better than it is. What you get is another redundant collection of Cher's Imperial recordings and that's pretty much it. The songs aren't bad, but they've all been re-issued on other collections before. The CD-ROM is nothing that couldn't have been printed in the booklet. On the CD-Rom you get a two page bio, a one page discography and five, count 'em FIVE photos in the photo gallery. You can pick which language you want to view the contents in and that is pretty much the most exciting thing on the disc! If you're looking for the songs, then pick up the disc. If you're buying it for the CD-ROM, you will want to skip this!"
4,Serious but very good,"During a school project based on the Holocaust,a bad-spirited boy will lead a hooked group of followers in a crusade of discrimination and hate."
1,It's ok.,"This is an ok book, but it's a cheap take from ""The Wave"" when this story was originally written."
4,I Pray Sam Cooke is with The Lord Jesus Christ Eternally!!!,"This DVD is wonderful for those of us who were young when Sam Cooke was popular and doing so many great things such as owning, writing, and producing his own music. I enjoy his talent today some 43 years later now that's classics for you. I wish he had stayed with The Lord and let the world come to him instead of the other way around. I just believe his outcome would have been much different but that's neither here nor there at this point. The man was great and God was good to loan him to us. KS"
5,Sam the Man,Timeless. History captured on disc; invaluable resource. Extra interviews are ideal. Cooke's contributions measured by those with whom he endured.
5,We Become Silent,"This DVD holds a very important message for everyone of us. Buy it, watch it and be very worried!It is time Big Pharma is held to account. Their unbelievable hold over us has to be stopped. They are now trying to end natural madicine - no money in it for them...while they still carry on delivering over priced medicines that really don't work."
1,Steve Madden Shoes - CRAP,"These shoes are NOT real leather, and they are not comfortable. They are obviously made of a cheap material (not real leather). To make it worse, someone tried to mark out the words ""man-made"" on the inside of the shoe with a black marker! Prpmptly returned them, and do not plan on buying any shoes from Mr. Madden again."
3,Only a few tracks are radio worthy,"I bought this album based upon the good customer reviews on this website. With original lyrics and true sound engineering (unlike the Britnney Spear-ed up cliches set to generic teeny-bopper samples), Tina Cousins deserves praise for her captivating voice put to trance-like music. In actuality, only a few of her songs off her album are worthy of such praise. They are (listed by track #):1. Killing Time 2. Pray 5. Forever 9. The Fool Is MeAs scary as this sounds, her 6th song on this album, titled Breathless, sounds like it's being sung by Celine Dion. Still, I'm glad I bought the album anyway. These 4 songs still make it a worthy buy, but don't purchase this album expecting every track to be on par with 5 stars."
4,One of the best voices in dance music ever!,"I first heard of Tina when i got her import single ""Forever"" - and from the first ""just hold me now.."" she had me hooked! afterwards i got her ""Pray"" and ""Angel"" import singles - so when i heard she was gonna have a full length cd - i was sooo excited. I, myself, couldn't wait for this cd to be released in the US - so i got it imported through a local dance music store. If you are reading this right now - you've GOT to get this disc - it's a steal! if you were to get it imported like i did - you'd have to pay over two-times this price - DON""T PASS THIS ONE UP!"
5,The Only Popular Band Without Hits.,"Between Collective Soul's 1995 Collective Soul and 1999's Dosage, it's difficult to decide which it the better of the two. I think Dosage is the place to start becuase it contains the great songs ""Run"", ""Generate"", ""Compliment"", ""No More, No Less"", ""Needs"", ""Slow"" and ""Dandy Life."" I don't think there's a bad track on Dosage. I'm glad radio didn't get the picture last year and overplay this great cd. I like to think of Collective Soul as similar to Rush, U2 and R.E.M. in that they have a strong fan base but don't need to have radio play in order to sell cds. Dosage and 1995's Collective Soul are must haves for any rock collector."
4,See Collective Soul Live,Saw Collective Soul at Woodstock 94. I couldn't believe how great they sounded and how hard they rocked. I bought all of their CDs and for the most part they are good but I wish they would capture some of the raw energy that Collective Soul has in their live shows. Their albums are a little too polished. Now that they are an established band I hope that their record co. and management cut them loose and let them rip on their next CD!
5,excellent album for most playing styles,"Collective Soul has proven themselves to be an excellent band. Their album ""Dosage"" varied it's styles in all of the songs that were played. It is a great album, and I can admire the band for sticking their necks out in playing so many different styles of rock. This is surely an album for all rock fans to consider. ENJOY!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I love Collective Soul,but this was a waste of my money. You would be better off buying Dosage and their self titled album. You are only getting one extra track that you haven't heard of before. Unless you are a die hard fan that has to have every song and all their music in every format (imports, box set, remixes etc.) then don't bother."
2,So-So,"Well I'm a Collective Soul fan but I wasn't too overly impressed by this CD. Now on their self-titled CD I love every song but on this CD the only real noteworthy song is ""Heavy."" In part because it sounds like some of their earlier stuff. Other than that song there's nothing that would make me listen to the other songs say if they were on while I was flipping stations on the radio. If you like Collective Soul because of songs like ""Simple"" or ""Where The River Flows"" I wouldn't suggest going out to buy this CD."
1,Worst album by the group so far,"An overall disappointment, this album is about as memorable as ""Varsity Blues"", an utterly forgettable film which unfortunately uses ""Run"" on its soundtrack. I don't know why Collective Soul is trying to copy the worst music of such 80s trash bands as Warrant and Tesla...the originality of ""Shine"" and ""The World I Know"" is nowhere to be found here. I'm majorly bummed that I bought such a rip-off CD."
1,this albulm seems not as heavy as some of their earlier stuf,the albulm is pretty good. the first single she says is a teeny bopper song and i resent collective soul for doing . The albulm has some bright spots and is alright.
1,"Absolutely terrible. Hate the band, Hate the tunes. JUNK",Stop wasting valuable space on radio air waves. I have never seen such junk.
5,Collective Soul- a band like no other,"Q:Which band which has had 7 number one hits before giving us their best album? A:Collective Soul. the secret to success with albums is VARIETY. each song is unique and beautifully crafted. whereas other bands such as greenday nirvana and stone temple pilots have died or deteriorated, cs appears stronger than ever. dosage is without question the best album to come from modern contemporary bands, and the only wonder is, why are they so underrated?"
4,99's first beginning to end album.,"A polished departure from CS's previous albums, this one is full of handsome effects: hues and textures that may disappoint older CS fans who liked their Grunge-lite demure. Composition via technology is the new methodology here.The departure is appreciated. Dosage has much more post-modern soul and gentility than Disciplined Breakdown (for example) which left one to wonder if this band was forever commited to recreating it's debut album.By comparison, Dosage is a breath of fresh air; it is energetic and agressive in spots, and simply lovely in others. This collection breathes well; there are no tracks to skip here. Throw away that remote.A recommended buy..."
4,Catchy songs for all musical tastes,"This is my first Collective Soul CD that I bought because every time I heard ""Heavy"" on the radio I jacked it all the way up. This disc is full of excellent songs. The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is Ed Roland's sometime overyl deep lyrics. I really like ""no more, No Less"", and ""Dandy life"", along with the powerhouses ""Run"" and, of course, ""Heavy"". Not a must own, but a very, very good CD"
3,New-style Collective Soul somewhat disappointing,"Collective Soul was one of the greatest bands of all time...that is until the release of Dosage. Though Dosage has its upsides, the majority of the CD was not that great. Collective Soul has sold out. They have given up on the old style that made the band great. The self-titled cd was the real band, and Disciplined Breakdown was also a great album...these albums reminded us of Collective Soul's identity...as a great band of their own. Now they insist on playing pop and lighter tunes, which is not really this band's style. The only good songs on the album, ""Run"" and ""Heavy"" are far cries from typical Collective Soul. So, for the sake of Collective Soul fans everywhere, do not buy this album unless you like sweet and sappy music."
5,i love this..,My first of Collective Soul's albums..It's so fabulous! So easy and deep..his voice is wonderful and glides out .. the band is great as well..Its alot softer than i expected.. lyrically... and thats just what i wanted.. Very pleased i made this purchase
1,Dull as a 12 year old knife,"This has to be CSs most dissapointing moments so far! I can't believe I yoosta like them. ""no more no less"" is just plain terrible ""needs"" is yawn-o-matic and CS is one of the lamest bands in tha known galaxy(the first lamest is the orange peels) Buy this only if you like cs and or rock music"
5,It's an AWSOME CD,"Collective Soul it's the best band in the world, and with this CD it proved it again. It has great songs, its a must have CD. Fave songs: Heavy, tremble for my beloved, Dandy life, No more no less, Slow, Run, Generate."
4,Ear Candy! You Won't Skip Tracks on This Album,"While this album doesn't have the edge of the band's past offerings, every song is a great listen. Heavy and Run will probably get the most airplay, but Needs, Compliment and Crown are my favorites. This album proves that a band doesn't have to recycle their ""sound"" to create another hit."
4,Why So Serious?,"I really like this album. Some very catchy guitar licks and decent lyrics. It may not be there most though provoking album but like most things, there is a time for fun and catchy music and other times for more serious stuff.Anyway, I am a huge fan of Collective Soul and this album has a number of very good, catchy tunes on it and a few really goods songs that should not be missed. And I find the song fairly memorable. If not in lyrics, at least in the hooks."
4,Solid Album!,"In the tradition of other Southern successes (R.E.M., The Connells and Jump, Little Children), Collective Soul provide a melodic tapestry of emotion on their latest studio effort. Singles ""Run"" and ""Crown"" are highlights, but all ths songs display lyrical and sonic mastery."
4,Hidden track and internet only access to music,"While I enjoyed the music on this CD, I totally dislike the records label use of the internet to get your email address in order to unlock the HIDDEN content on the cd. I hope this is not a music trend. If I pay $14 for a cd, I don't think it entitles you to make me give you an email address for junk mail in order to hear what I paid for. Not to mention having to be on the internet to listen to content that you paid for on your CD is totally wrong. I don't want to be on the internet to hear music that sounds better on my stereo than my PC. MUSIC 4 Stars, Record company marketing -10. IMHO TJ"
5,"Run, amazing song","Only for RUN, this CD is worth. Is one of the most beautiful songs of the past 20 years.The rest is ok, but the five stars are for RUN"
3,I Need More,"If 'Live' were the new 'The Call', 'Barenaked Ladies' the new 'Men At Work', 'Alanis Morissette' the new 'Sinead O'Connor', then 'Collective Soul' must be the new 'INXS'. Like INXS, Collective Soul recordings tend to be highly-polished. This CD is their most over-produced yet.Collective Soul are growing at a snail's pace. Dosage shows only slight improvement from even their first album. There is less lyrical substance as well. While songs like Slow and Needs show how good CS can be, embarassing songs like Dandy Life ruin an otherwise good CD.But, if you own the other CS albums, you won't be disappointed with Dosage. You won't be blown away either.[DW]"
5,Second favorite album of all time,"This is the most feel good album since Def Leppard ""Hysteria"". I have so many good memories from every track on this disc. It's just one of those that you can listen to over and over and never get sick of it. If this review can persuade one person to buy this album and enjoy it as much as I have over the years I will be happy."
5,Dosage-COLLECTIVE SOUL,"I hardly know where to begin, this is a great album. Being the first Collective Soul album I bought this has really influenced my choice of music-even to this day. An overwwlming mixture of fever pitch and harmonies, from dazzle to knock out in a second, you just cannot say enough positive things about this album. The beauty of this album is that it flows nicely thorough the songs. Local radio stationd play songs from this album and many other Collective Soul albums, so I think you will be surprised by the number of songs that you've heard before. This CD is the best possible introduction to Collective Soul that you can get. SO BUY IT NOW! -Sherman."
4,Just the right dosage.,"This album is really hard not to like. While their debut had the grunge vibe going for it, this is nearly pop perfection. Very catchy, good melodies and lyrics, and heavy and light at the same time. It does have the feel of Live, or maybe U2's last album. I play this often and never tire of it. It may not be their best, but if you like any of Collective Soul's other albums, you should enjoy this."
5,Great CD,"I was not a listener of Collective Soul when they were popular in the '90s or early '00s; so I am new to them. I love this CD however! A friend of mine who knew my musical style and taste thought I would like this CD and I do. It's a great mix of really different styles of music and I even like the order it is in; it seems to flow even though each song is so different than the one in front. Rock, Soul, Easy, Contemplative--it's all there. I know that some reviewers really raked Collective Soul over the coals (no rhyme intended here) but this is a great CD. Listen to the cuts before you buy; I happen to have very eclectic taste that runs the gamut from Classical to Blues to Blue Grass to Country to Classic Rock to Pop to Jazz and then some! So I liked the fact that there were so many different styles represented here."
5,WOW!,"This album is amazing. For the longest time I have only listen to the Collective Soul Album. But recently I bought Dosage, and it is so good. Every song is worth listening to. I am really suprised at how awesome every track is so good. I would recommend this album to all."
4,Great Album...,"Good enough to go see them at the ""Grand Thétre"" of Québec city (3/26/99). I already have my tickets."
4,"This cd is a must, its great!","I was able to hear the promo of ""Dosage"" at a friends record store. There are some real good songs here. I've been hearing the song ""Run"" for a couple of weeks now, and I think that song is real good, but there are also some better songs on this cd such as ""Heavy"", which with some air play will make this cd a big seller. All in all ,this Collective Soul cd should be a very big disc for this band.I hope that sometime this year they do a show at The Mark of the Quad Cities in Moline Illinois.I'll definately get my tickets.Everyone go buy this cd.You won't be sorry."
4,Speaks to me,"Growing up in the extreme Northeastern part of States exposed me to some of the greatest classic and cutting-edge radio stations in Quebec and Ontario, Canada. Through them, I learned to deeply critique music for both its musical score and lyrics. This group is outstanding and has enough uniqueness to ensure its longevity. It is clear that Ed Roland has raw talent. He just knew he had to somehow make it onto a big label someday. He and his group have indeed arrived."
3,Good story,"Good story and enjoyed reading but know not accurate. One inaccurate fact was mention of William (Bill) being lost and running out of fuel. William Kennedy did not run out of fuel nor was he lost. He stopped driving as blinding, wind blown snow made it impossible to see. Not wanting to hurt or hit anyone or thing stopped. Usually wind blown snow is a temporary happening but this time lasted a long.......... time. Therefore the 16 hours waiting."
5,Excellant Monitor,"Got this Monitor for Gaming Mostly. Play BF2, Doom3,FarCry, and Half Life all with now ghosting whatso ever. No Dead pixels at all. Came when they said with no problems. Great looking Monitor."
3,Whistled and flickered,"I have to assume mine was defective, but it whistled and flickered.Amazon, being a great store, not only gave me a refund but covered the shipping back. Way to go Amazon!"
3,3 dead pixle industry standard,"Seems like a great monitor except for the BRIGHT RED dead pixle in the middle of the screen. At least Newegg advertises their dead pixle policy - ordered from AMAZON because have had good customer service in the past, and didn't want to have to deal with dead pixles. GUESS WHAT - AMAZON's unadvertised dead pixle policy is over 3 dead pixles to be considered defective. You have to eat the shipping for anything less. Go to a store where you can actually see this monitor hooked up before you can buy it. Or you may get stuck with a defective product or have to eat the shipping. You're definitely taking a chance ordering a monitor online - you pay for the defects."
3,It's okay,Had this monitor for a few years. It is still working but not that great of a picture. Bought an new HP widescreen and it beats this display hands down!!!!
3,"Beautiful, but not for hardcore gamers","I got this LCD monitor to replace an NEC Diamondtron CRT that failed after two years. I read the reviews about how good this looks when gaming. The monitor does look really good, has sharp colors and looks crisp. The shortcomings are noticed when there is a lot of high speed motion during games such as BF2 and UT2004. The best way to describe the problem is ""blurring"". I'm not sure if the cause of the blurring is a pixel response time or ??? Whatever, this monitor is great for everything but gaming in my opinion. I would suggest a CRT for hardcore gamers."
5,Truly the best I have seen after looking at dozens of LCDs.,"I bought the VX924 after looking at many, many monitors and using quite a few different ones where I work. I am completely satisfied with the quality and performance in every way. The dual inputs allow me to hook it to both my Mac and PC without an external video switch. The color and response time are superior. My thanks to ViewSonic for an OUTSTANDING product in a market overflowing with competition."
5,Unbelievable Monitor,"Just got the monitor & its a breeze to install. The picture is FANTASTIC!!!! Had an NEC 19"" & the Viewsonic beats it hands down. Also, the price is alot better than the NEC. Have purchased Viewsonics for clients but never for myself & will now be buying nothing but Viewsonic. EXCELLENT product!!!!!"
3,Not impressed for the money.,"I bought this monitor because of good reviews and industry feedback. I am not seeing it. I am guessing that many folks are awed by this as their first LCD monitor.I've seen other, far less expensive, LCD monitors that deliver as well or better.On the plus side, not a single dead pixel."
1,Incompatible,"I was unable to use this monitor. It would blink as frequently as every one to two seconds. Viewsonic tech support sent a replacement and it did the same thing. Tech support then tried to tell me I had a problem with my computer but I did not believe that since it worked fine with my old monitor. My computer, a pentium running Windows98, is old but the advertised tech specs did not list any special requirements that would preclude this monitor. I ended up buying through Amazon a competitive monitor and it worked fine."
2,Fell apart after 1 day,This felt like heavy quality material and it really is.The stitching is low quality though.After one day of use the stitching fell apart causing the holsterhalf of this product to no longer be useable. The belt andpistol magazine holster still work but the pistol holster itself cannot be worn any longer.PROS:Heavy materialSpace for 4 magazines and 1 pistolCONS:Poor stitchingFell apart after one day of use
4,great product,"great product, bought it for part of a halloween costume and ended up using it on my security detail job. love it"
4,A very nice set,"A complete set and more than adequate for my needs and on my budget. All of the items are very adjustable and after some playing with it, I was able to get everything adjust to my size and build. Everything falls nicely to hand. For the combination of items, it is hard to beat the price for this set."
3,it wasn't terrible,Perfect for its price range. There where inconsistencies in the shape and size of the magazine Pockets which led to ripping. Definitely needs breaking in just don't use too much force. Seller got the product shipped and to me in A very reasonable time frame.
2,Spend a little more and get something else,"The build quality of this product is pretty poor but you do get what you paid for; which wasn't much. Your better off buying something else. While my M&P40 fits relatively well inside this holster, it doesn't sit well on my thigh. The weapon doesn't stay close to your body and just jingles around. To much free flow and movement, my weapon never felt secure inside while I was carrying. If I had a second chance I would not of bought this product."
2,Keep looking,Bought this set up thinking it would work with my paintball gear. After 2 games the holster broke and i wound up losing one of my 20 dollar mags. i recommend looking for something else.
1,Not worth.....,"This holster is not worth the money and it won't even hold my Beretta 92FS 9mm. The straps are no longer working and my gun is dangling all over the place. If you are a Police Officer or member of the SWAT Team, please don't waste your money in this holster. I have wasted my time and money with this poorly made holster. I have nothing more to say, but ""frustrated"" with this product. A total piece of J....."
3,"Works fine, but will destroy your pants.","The stitching holding the gun holster tore the first time i put my gun in it just from walking around my apartment, not to let that stop me I sewed it back together and that is the strongest part of the holster. I used this when I went backpacking, I walked about 10 miles or more while wearing this, it held together fine, but when I got into my car the material wore through my jeans. I'm now thinking of adding a more smooth material to the inside of the leg strap to protect my pants. I'd gladly spend more money to have one that doesn't destroy pants. I bought a belt holster to eliminate this while hiking."
3,ok for the starter airsofter,when i got this i thought cool!! this is awseme but boy was i wrong.I am a pro airsofter because im bad *** and my dad owns the team but i bought this cause for my b-day i got a gift card to amazon so i picked this up... my $164 kwa m9 ptp was in this holster i played a full day of airsoft with out using my oistol and never checked it later i found out that the holter pushes the mag relese on my m9 when its in the holster. So i later found out that i lose my m9 mag:(. so overall good for the price but only for starters or for a prop!
2,you get what you pay for...,"All in all you get what you pay for ...the holster is crap.. the drop leg magazine platform is good...I took the holster apart used an old hip holster and added what was missing on my old one with the Velcro etc. to make a great holster,out of one crappy holster to customize my good one, to an awesome holster......"
2,"2-Stars Soley for the Price, Not Made for a Real Firearm and Mags","I order this thigh holster because of the price and that it had a cool left leg magazine holster, knowing that a low price meant it would most likely be terrible quality. Sure enough, I tried it on and it fit nice, but the pistol holster didn't hold my Beretta 92FS very well, plus I put a couple mags in the cheap Velcro magazine pouches on my left leg and one of them fell completely off due to bad stitching. So I returned the item the next day, do not buy this if you want to use it for real ammo and firearms, btu I'm thinking a lightweight airsoft gun and mags would fit fine."
4,drop leg holster,gun holster works great. i am a 44 waist and belt fits ok wouldnt recommend for anyone bigge. i use itfor my xd 40 and dont have a problem with th mag release.u get what you pay for it. would buy it again
4,Completely Adjustable!,"I purchased this product for a Halloween costume and i am thoroughly impressed with it. I thought the whole thing was going to be too big, but literally every aspect of this holster is adjustable. I am short, so the drop leg holster that slips onto the belt portion is a little long. I might be able to use a safety pin to hoist it up a little; otherwise the drop leg will be more of a drop knee. Overall, I am very satisfied with the quality of this product for the price."
3,Worth the price,"Overall its a decent holster for the price. It has durable 2"" straps, I like all the quick disconnects and its fully adjustable. I bought the holster for backpacking so I don't have to wear a hip holster and for the most part I believe it will work.Some things I didn't like about it. The holster itself is kinda loose, the hard plastic offers no tension to hold the pistol in place. The holster also connects at only one point on the thigh strap. This causes it to rock back and forth on your leg as you move. It's a bit annoying and with time will likely break. However if you're handy enough, these problems are easily and cheaply fixable."
5,Very nice for the price,I bought this for my wife to use as part of a Halloween costume. After the costume party I decided to keep the rig for myself. I was very surprised of the weight and quality of this rig. The thick nylon straps have Velcro in between them so they keep things very tight in place. The belt is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. Once adjusted it says in place. The mag pouches fit glock mags perfectly and the snap keeping the gun in place break easily and keep the gun secure when closed. All in all you cant beat this for the price.
2,I don't like it,"it's completely plastic and looks it, really cheap looking that is. And it doesn't come with instructions in the box."
2,3- pc drop leg holster,"Doesn't work for me , didn't fit any of my guns even the mag pouches . very awkward and uncomfortable , doesn't lay right . I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone . save your money sure wish I hadn't ordered this thing"
5,GREAT PRODUCT,THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL. IT IS VERY TACTICAL AND COMFORTIBLE. I AM AN OFFICER AND PLAN ON USING THIS EQUIPMENTIN THE LINE OF DUTY. ITS FAST DRAWING HOLSTER AND ROOM FOR CARRYING MANY MAGIZINES WILL BE USEFUL IN THE PREFORMANCEOF MY DUTIES. I DIFFENTLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
2,Falls Apart Easily,"I bought this with the intention of using it for tactical and survival purposes. I took it out with me into the Florida woods around Forth White for a training and survival exercise, and after a simple three days of simple patrols the stitching started coming undone. It fell apart at the most important seams: that ones that hold the weapon tight against my leg. Now the pistol flaps violently back and forth whenever I have to run, and I cant use it effectively anymore. Spend your money elsewhere."
1,bad product..,we have now gotten 2 of these and they both have broken as soon as we took it out of the box.....
3,Its alright,"I like the setup, i don't like the holster its made really cheap. My gun is a full size 9mm, didn't fit well in the holster, the holster big and bulky and the leg strap was not attach real well. The 3 mags holder is made better, I like it better then the holster. I got what I paid for, Shipping was good about 3-4 day after I ordered it."
2,Cheap thing,very cheap thing in terms of material and shape. It feels like several big chunks put together. I would not be satisfied with it even with recreation purpose so I returned it back. But it's reasonable for the price though.
3,"Great for $10, for fun, not for combat.","This tactical holster setup is exactly what you paid for, and since it's only ten dollars...I already owned a beautiful Blackhawk holster for my Beretta 92, but didn't have a duty belt or legdrop mag pouch.I was looking at dutybelts and saw this. I ordered it, and used my holster and their magpouch and duty belt and am well pleased.The belt expands out to be usable by nearly anyone, the leg straps as well. The stitching is good quality, as are the plastic buckles and straps themselves.**WARNING** If you are buying this to use on an actual firearm, be careful of the holster. It will eject your magazine, the thumb-break is not adjustable and is floppy.I ended up giving the holster part of this item to my 10 year old neighbor to play airsoft with."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I know what you're thinking: ""A 3 piece leg holster for only $11?!"". Trust me, you get what you pay for. This holster is made of extremely cheap material, The leg straps barely fit around my thighs (I'm 6' 215lb if that helps), and both leg straps broke the first match I took them to. Yes, it does look pretty cool on you. I'm not gonna lie, I did stand in front of the mirror with this thing on and thought I was pretty B.A. But looks can be decieving"
4,"Comfortable, well-made","This holster setup is exact;y what I was looking for. It is comfortable to wear, holds my Springfield XD securely and within easy reach and is adjustable in nearly every way. The material is tightly woven and is fairly sturdy, so this holster should hold up to repeated use and abuse. My only complaint is that I wish the interior side was lined with an extra layer, however if you wear medium to heavy duty combat clothing, this holster is perfectly comfortable."
3,Works as a haloween costume,I probably wouldn't use this as an actual holster but it works as a costume peice. Although I didn't get to test it out cause it arrived after my haloween party.
1,Broke first time,"When I received my item, I found it quite counterintuitive in how it worked, and it had so much Velcro that it just was tedious to make adjustments to. But that was just trying it on. When I actually wore it with my whole costume the holster busted putting it on my leg. It also would not stay in place on my leg (before the thread snapped). I was very disappointed in this item and do not recommend it.Also, it busted my cap gun..."
1,Unsatisfied,"I,was pretty unhappy with the product, It came with a stain on it and looks to be used when it says it is a brand new product. It feels extremely bulky and heavy. Overall very unsatisfied"
4,Decent product,This product is exactly what I expected. For the price its great. If your looking for somthing for serious shooting this is not your item but if your looking for costume or occational airsoft apparal then I would recoment this item. Material is a bit thin for use with a real gun although it would work just not sure how long.
4,Good for a costume,"I bought this for a costume, and it worked well for that purpose. I would not buy this product if you're hoping to use it to hold guns, as it slides around and the clips seem flimsy. It's also semi-difficult to adjust for a smaller person."
4,"Works great, easy to adjust, great value","I actually bought this for a Halloween costume, it seems extremely well made, it was very easy to adjust and comfortable to wear all day."
3,Fun while it lasted,"Pros: cheap, holster fit some of my guns, comes with a beltCons: poor stitching on some parts, and doesn't fit some of my more unique pistols. Also the magazine part of the holster is a bit too short to hold any full size mags securely (can't close the Velcro over the mag) straps are not elastic so not great for runningWell 15 dollar for a 3 piece holster is a great deal. Unfortunately the second day of use I accidentally tore the holster part of the pistol right off the rig. Not too upset though because to the price I was not expecting anything of amazing quality. It would be great for a costume though."
1,LOOKS LIKE FRAUD TO ME.,All positive reviews about this product come the manufacturer or vendor and are given 5 stars. Amazon must take more measures to verify misleading ratings and reviews. I just received my shipment of this product and regret not having caught the misleading review before ordering. But will never buy from this vendor in the future.
1,Made it worse....,"Will never buy it again. This product doesn't wrok at all, I spent so much money and feel like it was a scam."
2,Didn't Do Much For Me,"I believe that guys can have different reasons for male infertility and certain supplements work for one and not for another. The best luck I had BY FAR was with a book on Amazon called, ""How I increased my semen volume and sperm count"" by Jason Michael."
2,Don't think it did anything,"I don't think this did anything for us, but with a product like this, it's really hard to know for sure; even if you get pregnant while your husband uses it, that doesn't mean it was because of this necessarily.PLEASE be wary of the many raving reviews on here where the person hasn't reviewed ANY other products (click on ""see all reviews"" by their username to check). That always makes me question the authenticity of the review."
5,"After a year of trying, prego!!!!","I was skeptical but I ordered this product for my husband and had him take it twice a day every day. We had been trying for over a year to make a baby and nothing worked. After a month of him taking this pill, I missed my period and we took a test and it came back positive!!!! We bought two more tests and those were positive too, the doctor confirmed that I'm indeed pregnant. I'm not fifteen weeks pregnant and seriously think it's due to this little miracle pill. I highly recommend it."
2,Ehh....,"I didn't like this product. We never had any ""problems"" getting pregnant the first time before we tried this but I decided to give it a go after I had a miscarriage in June 2010. I bought the set for both female and male back in July. I only took 3 days of the female one due to being hospitlized for something else so I don't know if it helped my fertility in anyway but my husband took the male one for about 2 wks and we noticed that his ""load"" (sorry TMI) was DECEASED then the way it was before he got on the medication. He said that he didn't like the way it made him feel either, and once he stopped he returned back to ""normal"" and within 4 wks of stopping we got pregnant anyways in late August. So I doubt we'll be ordering this in the future."
3,No luck with Fertil Aid for me,"This product did not work for me. I am using Fertil Aid for almost an year. After using this for first 2 months, my wife underwent for IUI and doctor has seen a slight(motility has increased from 35- 45% and no change in count) improvement in motility. That IUI did not work for us. From then on, I started using Fertil Aid regularly for almost around 9 months now with good dieting and exercise and we tried naturally but nothing worked out for us. I later on went for semen analysis recently and there is no improvement at all from what I've seen about 9 months ago. I also used Motility boost and count boost for almost 2 months but no improvement.Based on my experience, I guess you can also use Speman tablets which are less expensive but provide the same benefits...Himalaya Speman, 60 capsules (Pack of 5)I hope this helps."
3,just a multivitamin,"i believe this is just a mixture of vitamins that would be equivalent to a multivitamin. if you look at the ingredients closely, the only added are vitex, chasteberry, etc. i think this might help couples with mild to no conditions of conceiving. we tried this for a few months and it didn't work. when i spoke to my infertility physician, she said it works the same way as taking a multivitamin and some other supplements. the bottle is quite costly."
4,Es un beneficio,"Me diagnosticaron azoospermia, es un golpe duro cuando quieres tener familia navegando por la internet vi una referencia de este producto, y en mi caso no pierdo nada intentando pregunte a mi doctor y lo compre, les puedo decir que en el ultimo chequeo me dieron buenas noticias mi condicion esta mucho mejor la cantidad espermatica a aumentado el triple sin exageracion, y me siento muy a gusto voy or el 3er bote y espero que dentro de pronto estar completamente bien y venir a decirles que voy a ser papa primero Dios"
3,Nothing happened...,"We received this product in November and my hubby started taking them right away. We haven't had another SA done yet, but I'm not pregnant yet either! I'm losing faith in this product, after all the great reviews I read I really thought this would be what we needed to improve his count etc. Obviously not.He never had any side effects and took 3 a day everyday. Too bad they didn't actually do anything for us."
4,"So far, tripled the results!","My husband had an SA that wasn't that amazing -- particularly, the morphology was low. Everything else was low to average.He made some life changes -- no laptop on lap, less biking, no tight clothes, local/organic foods only, more vegetables, and more vitamins. This included Fertil-Aid for the first time.His next SA (about a month and a half later), all the numbers tripled (at least). It was pretty incredible.I'm sure all the changes he made helped contribute to the great results, but I did want to give props to Fertil-Aid because it was part of the equation. I understand there are a lot of people like me out there looking to boost their fertility, reading reviews til late in the night, overwhelmed by all the advice and product selection. Give this one a whirl alongside the other changes we did; check your results in two months. Best of luck."
2,too many bars,"I used to see JT in DC growing up. He was a licktionary and the nighthawks played great. But the yeas in bars have taken their toll--the sound is very second rate barroom blues (the rythm section is loose in a not good way), with not very good guitar tone (always was a problem when he played his V), and very poor material (there's lots of good songs to choose from that have never been recorded). He really knows a lot about blues so I would encourage him to go towards more traditional material and alternatives to 3 piece blooze rock--like jug bands, twelve strung finger picking etc.... b/c he really is a skilled guitarist"
5,"Unbeleivable realism, an Incredible Thrill ride!","I read ""Day of the Cheetah"" about 8 years ago, and have been a devout Dale brown fan every since. ""Shadows of Steel"" was yet another great book by a great author. Dale gives us Characters that pull you into the story. A Chinese Built aircraft carrier, and Patrick McLanahan in a B-2 Stealth. What more do you need? I must also strongly recommend ""Tin Men"", this might be my favorite so far."
4,Great Book,"This is a Very good Book, this is my Third Dale Brown book and i love this one .. the plot is very good, the Flying action is out of this world, I think this B-2 bomber is a favorite from the autor, this book is a must read if you like Dale Brown."
4,A frightening look at what could happen in the middle-east.,As always Mr. Brown is doing a very good job of turning out very good books. This book is very good but only if read in the correct order in which the books go. If you don't read his books in chronological order they won't be as exciting. None the less this book is a smash thriller in itself espcially with all of the new charecters he introduces you to.
1,Early inconsistency made a promising book unreadable,"Most of Dale Browns' books are great, but he and his editor must have been asleep at the beginning of this one. A complete contradiction between pages 60 and 64 made me quit reading it.Page 60: Iranian ambassador pledges to VP ""..we will remove our aircraft carrier from the gulf."" VP: ""..an interesting idea..must present it to the President.""Page 64: National security advisor (to VP): ""..You heard me right ..Iran's new aircraft carrier has put to sea."" VP: ""Iran has an aircraft carrier(words emphasized)? Since when?"" in complete surprise.The total conversations I excerpted from make it even more preposterous. After that I quit. The book was completely ruined."
2,Not worth the read.,"This is hardly worth the title of ""book"" since it appears to be a collection of indecipherable notes. It's not so much not well written, more that it's not worth of the word written at all. It's a waste of money."
5,perfect,"Our swimmer is going through suits like water (sorry) and she is still growing, so we are hesitant to spend large amounts on chlorine resistant. This suit has the construction at the right price. It is a winner."
3,Fabric not as solid as it looks in the pictures,"I found the fabric quite flimsy, the coverage wasn't quite what I expected at all since it's not sufficiently padded in the chest area. So I don't wear it, it just sits in my closet, but it's a pretty color and would work for those who don't mind."
4,Additional Comments...,"Because I've had more time to listen to this CD since I submitted my review, I'd like to add another great track to those I praised earlier: ""When It Rains It Pours."" This deserves to be included with the others I listed...a great production!"
2,I Could Have Lived Without It,"Besides Barbara's Solo Hit "" I've Got A Feeling "", there's not much else here to hold my interest. I gambled.......and lost !"
2,Okay but,the design is good but the material the clips are attached to are very stiff. It digs into the skin. It's not even tight and it is bothersome. I would not order a second one.
5,FINALLY FOUND MY PERFECT SIZE!,"I am ecstatic at finding this bra in 46A which I realize is an oddball size. I have been tortured for years wearing the wrong size bra and this one is just right. It fits my shoulders without hurting and I can't even feel the underwire. I can wear this bra all day without having to yank it off after a few hours like I used to do with my other bras in the past. It's also a beautiful bra, so that's a bonus. I will be ordering a lot more as soon as the seller stocks up on more of these in my size. Who would've thought I would find my perfect bra on Amazon. Thank you, Amazon, and the seller HerRoom!"
4,Very comfortable,"This review is for your Leading Lady Plus Size Seamless Underwire Bra. (Please note the correction).I am a rather small individual, wearing an 8P to 10P in clothing. I am of a mature age and do not like the tight feel of restrictive clothing. I, therefore, prefer a size 38A bra which is nearly impossible to find. I received my, Leading Lady,"" bra and find it to be comfortable. There are numerous 38B's and up, but rarely 38A's to be found anywhere. The A cup is ideal for me and the comfort as well as appearance is wonderful. I'm now going to order a second Leading Lady bra. I must add, the only negative I find in the style of this bra is the rather wide/thick shoulder straps."
4,Better that your average short story collection.,"The first story, told from a horse's point of view, wasn't all that great, and started me wondering about the rest of the book. Good thing I didn't give early. The William Keith story about the Alabama man who changes the outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg, and in turn the war, based upon a meeting with himself from the future was execellent. And _Hex'em John_ would make an awesome Twilight Zone episode.I really appreciate the fact that all of the stories were written this year, probably for this book, and not a repacking of older stories that I have already read in other collections. Mr. Greenberg keep 'em comin'!"
3,Theoretically good,"I've had these in use at my home for quite a few years and just assumed they worked. However, I must confess that although the theory sounds good, I'm not sure they work as well as promised in the actual toilet. I still notice build up of some nasty stuff if I don't keep the toilets cleaned regularly. Oh well......"
5,WORKS WELL,"WE HAVE A TERRIBLE PROBLEM WITH HARD WATER BUILD UP STAINS, EVEN SCRUBBING THE TOILET WITH HARD BRUSHES AND CHEMICALS DID NOT EASILY REMOVE STAINS. tHIS PRODUCT WORKED FOR ME AND REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. iT IS MUCH EASIER TO CLEAN THE TOILETS NOW."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"I recently purchased this item to help eliminate a hard water/sulfur buildup in my toilet, after scourering the toilet and starting with a clean surface, the buildup returned! This product has not made any difference at all, complete waste of money!!"
5,Very Intense and they can do it LIVE!,"This is the debut CD recording from Happy Family on Cuneiform records. This is HARD< FRANTIC Japanese Progressive Rock so do not kid yourself. This is a most impressive CD and fits well with the likes of bands like Ruins, Tipographica, Zappa's 1978 period, etc.Excellent spin!"
3,works fine,"a bit bulky, when i tighten it on my arm, after about 30 minutes, it becomes a bit uncomfortable. Over a shirt though, it feels fine. I only use it for a 30 minute walk. I would buy again."
3,pioneering recording of a pioneering composer,"This disc, originally issued on LP in the '70s, was the first commercial recording of music by Heinrich. All the pieces on it are from the very beginning of his career, and have the uneven quality of apprentice works. The two selections from _The Sylviad_ however are first-rate, highly imaginative, and show ""the Beethoven of America"" at his best. The performances, by faculty and students at the University of Illinois, are enthusiastic, accurate and respectful. The recorded sound is tolerable."
1,Pretty poor psychological thriller,"I'm surprised that Bruce Campbell found this shoddy little film something to champion. It's extremely amateurish from start to finish, in writing, acting, and direction. It's nothing that you haven't see before a dozen times, and done much better. The thrust of the bonus material seems to be that since this is a totally independent film, it's something to be treasured. Maybe, but a little quality somewhere along the line would have helped. I was really ready to like this film,, but just couldn't do it. Even the bonus material is poorly produced. Who wants to watch tons of deleted and extended scenes from a film barely worth watching in the first place? A disappointment all around."
1,Hated Every Minute,"Hideously acted and just full of faux male angst, this movie is extremely easy to choke on. Just completely awful. Whatever possessed Bruce Campbell to associate his name with this drivel?"
5,edge of your sofa thriller!,"Deadly Gold is a classic mystery that encompasses romance, nature, and greed. I flew through the pages, always yearning to know what Simmons would throw in next."
1,"Dictionary for Dreamers by Chetwynd, Tom",This order was not received because the order was never completed as owner said it could not be found.
3,A new take,"This is a meticulously researched, sympathetic biography which makes good use of diaries and other materials not available to prior writers. The results are fascinating, even if the conclusions are ultimately unconvincing (e.g, Kate Chase was basically a woman like most others simply looking for love). Her contemporaries certainly saw her as a conniving, ambitious politico and while that portrait may be too harsh, this book carries it too far in the other direction. Still, a very valuable addition to the small body of writings focusing on the daughter of Lincoln's Treasury Secretary."
3,Docfungus1@Aol.Com,"The first half of this book is a narrative on the history of childhood,which is slow and tedious, but the second half is much more insightful. In my opinion, this was not his best work but a good attempt."
5,The meaning of the electronic age,"This book pairs well with Mr. Postman's superb book, ""Are We Amusing Ourselves to Death?"" Both together give the reader a deep understanding of the difference between our former print culture and our present electronic culture. Although they were written before the internet catapulted into such prominence, it is amazing how the author conveys how deeply different are cultures based in print and based in electronics. The major changes we see and will see in children produced by an electronic culture are well foreshadowed by this book."
4,The Disappearance of Childhood: A look Into the Formative Opportunities of Being A Child,"Somewhat wordy in places, yet a good discussion of pertinent issues of childhood and the social influences that go against the grain of natural childhood development."
3,toy,"I purchased this as a gift for my niece. She is four years old and is having a lot of fun playing with it. It is cheaply made but arrived in nice package. I already figured it wouldn't be durable, so I was not at all disappointed."
4,White and dark: the spirit of german cinema,"In this work, Lotte Eisner makes an inteligent analysis about the influences of the expressionism and german theather in the german cinema. It's important to know that expressionism have been confused, not rarely, with other kind of ideological and esthetical sources of influence. And about this confusion, this book brings a good help. The authorress identifies and points what is expressionism and what is not, where are the traces of the expressionism, of the german theather or of whatever. And besides, Lotte Eisner makes an interesting and complete review of the most important german films, for example Caligari, Nosferatu and Metropolis, also speaking a little about other films related to Germany, yet made in other countries. Since the authoress was one of the most important movie critics of Germany, and also a wickness of the birth of german cinema after the First World War, her statements or reviews are solid and plenty of good reveals."
3,Great Pictures/Irritating Text,"I know this is one of the classic books of film history and one of the most famous books on the films of the Weimar era.However, I found it incredibly hard going. The photos are great and really give the reader a desire to see these gripping, strange films. The text, however, made me want to put the book down and read something else.Perhaps the problem is that the book was written in French and translated into English, but the text did not flow. I was aware of having to work at reading this prose. The chapters did not especially seem to build on each other but seemed to leap from topic A to C to E then back to B.Kracauer's ""From Caligari to Hitler"" is a far better overview of this era. ""The Haunted Screen"" will make you aware of some very interesting films, but it is best to treat it as a picture book and not a text to be read from cover to cover."
4,I thought it was written with spirit and imagination.,"At first the book was boring, I wanted to put it down. Once I got into what the book was actually about it became interesting and suddenly I couldn't put it down. The outcome is surprising though. I figured Wade would have comited suicide after killing Jack."
4,Awesome!!!!!,"This book is hysterical!!!! I escpecially enjoyed the part where Fudge covered his baby brother with stamps. If you liked this I suggest Ramona the Pest or something from the Hardy Boys mystery series. Bo Powell, NJ"
3,"Good Writing, Slow Story","I found this story to be well written, but a little boring, a little long winded. I didn't find to Wade to be an engaging character. And to be honest, I didn't really care what happened to him. I feel a twinge of guilt admitting that. Everyone talks about what a fantastic author Banks is. And maybe he is, this was my first Banks novel. I will try again with one of his other novels, but this one was a B-."
5,Excellent,"A stirring and strange tale that turns a philosophial microscope on a troubled man waging battle against his community, his self and his painful past."
5,small town made large,"I'm still hesitant to go out and rent the video as I don't know if I'm ready to put myself through it all again so soon. Banks takes the two issues of small town America and abuse and writes them into a narrative that premeates our souls. The dark shadows that linger in the lives of Wade and the gang reach over into the bright lights and big city of his brother, ex-wife and lawyer. Tragedy abounds, just look around. After the first few chapters I realized I didn't have to try the great small town novel, it had just been done."
3,a well-written novel,"""Affliction"" is a well-written contemporary novel. It's not a five-star masterpiece; I like to be more cautious and save five stars for Lawrence, Woolf, and Conrad. But it has a taut, well-paced narrative, subtle use of symbol, and a structure in which every piece falls together to produce a cohesive whole."
3,Rhyme Time Review,"Rhyme Time Center is generally a fun toy, but doesn't hold my daughter's attention span for very long. It has some cute sounds, alot of bright colors and lights, but it's not worth the price."
1,not the best vtech out there!!!,"I bought this toy for my 1 yr old twins (recommended age was 12 mnths and up), but they were so bored by it that I returned it the next day. Each time a button is pushed a new tune or phrase starts and since most nursey rhymes are long, they never heard them in their entirety because at 12 mnths of age, kids just like to push buttons, not sit there and wait for the rhyme to end. It was difficult for me to figure out how to get the book rhymes to work, let alone for my babies (sometimes you hear the whole rhyme, sometimes just the beginning of it over and over). I got it on sale...and still felt that it was not worth the price."
2,"What a joke. This is not a ""real"" video.","Bad acting, bad costumes, bad accents, bad editing. I thought that this was suppose to be actual footage. Looks like something that would come on a late night cable channel - produced by college students."
5,OMG!,That was some really freaky stuff!!!! Actress was Amazing! Very well done altogether. Def a good movie if you like to be freaked out!!! Words of advice...don't watch alone in the dark like I did!
4,"Rich in detail, but has small print.","The book provides well-informed background on the major players. Primarily a text book, its print is small, with a left margin that takes 1/3 of the glossy page. Get your glasses out."
2,Is it Restored?,"I have two copies of THE APE, and both are unwatchable, due to constant splices in the film the DVDs are made from. Is this any different? Is there a copy out there that has been restored from original negatives or pristine prints? I surely would like to see on and I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Will someone let me know?"
5,Not a loser in the bunch,The album starts strong with You've Been An Inspiration To Me and seems to keep on getting better. No Other Fountain and It's Alright are two smooth a capella numbers. The arrangement of Just a Little Talk With Jesus is outstanding.
1,"Danger, danger",How can anyone recommend this nonsense to children. Tin LeHaye is a theological wasteland who writes in order to scare the hell out of people. Can I give minus stars?
5,Old gospel hymns make a comeback!,"I love this CD! A local Christian radio station has started playing ""Maw-Maw's Song (In the Sweet By and By)"" and I just loved it. So, I went out and bought the CD. After listening to just the first song, I was hooked. There are country, blues, and jazz renderings of these 10 great old gospel hymns. I am so grateful to Mr. Millard for keeping these hymns alive for the next generation. I am hoping that we will be treated to a ""Hymned, No.2"" (pretty please!) in the near future. I sure would love to hear Mr. Millard sing ""Just As I Am"" (hint, hint). This CD is thoroughly enjoyable and very worshipful. Highly recommended!"
5,A COURAGEOUS INTERPRETATION OF THE GOSPELS!,"E.J. DiStefano, in my opinion, should go down in history as one of the most courageous spirtual writers of all time. Though his novel, ""Beloved Testament,"" is a quick and easy read (Thank God!), it is as profound and thought provoking, in my view, as the writings of Merton, St. Francis of Assisi, and even St. Paul. These writers were chastised in their own time for being too controversial, yet it is such controversy and ambiguity that enables us to expand our spiritual universes. Very well done, Mr. DiStefano!"
5,Read Communicate or Die!,"So simple it's radical! In easy but elegant prose, Dr. Zweifel maps out an effective practice to re-engage the often forgotten but most fundamental of all human tools: communication. His timely and practical advice on active listening and effective speaking can benefit everyone no matter what the endeavor. From personal relationships, dealing with a boss, or leading a multinational corporation, this book is a must for any citizen of the modern world."
4,A good comic but not an extraordinary sequel to Dark Empire,Dark Empire II is good as far as comics goes but I think that having super weapons isn't fascinating anymore. We've seen so much weapons that a Galaxy Gun becomes dull. Could they use SMALL WEAPONS instead?You're the judge.
3,Oh No! The clone had a clone!,"The clone emperor cloned himself and Luke must stop him again. This is the sequel to Dark Empire and is very entertaining. There is a Dark Empire III, but you can skip that one. Dark Empire II is worth a listen.Dark Empire and Dark Empire II take place Six years after the Battle of Endor, (but after the Zahn trilogy). Luke discovers that the emperor is still alive. Luke researches whether a jedi has ever returned from the dark side. This is cool, because this acknowledged the earlier comics dealing with the jedi and sith 3,000 to 5,000 years ago (learned in the holocron's that Luke has gathered.)This is the description of the comic which the audio tape is based on."
3,This was an average book.,"Although this book continues the story of Star Wars I think that the Emperor should finially meet his end without coming back to life. Tom Veitch does a pretty good job at telling the story but I think he should stop makeing more super weopons and focus on the characters more than he does. I liked the art work done by Cam Kennedy, but I didn't like the fact that the characters had a green tint to them. But over all this was a fairlly well done story."
3,It was okay.,"This book was okay. The galaxy gun is a little over hyped. Also, why does everybody look green? Cam Kennedy's art stinks!"
4,eh...,"this graphic novel was pretty good, but as the reviews seem to indicate, not as good as the original. the emporer coming back again is...kind of annoying...makes one wonder if he CAN be killed. Luke's apparently got another girlfriend, but she gets killed. no surprizes here folks. the story was OK and believe if you've read Dark Empire I you should go ahead and read this one although it ends in a semi - cliffhanger, with the alliance on the losing end. a bit of a disappointment but worth reading. -=-zulumaccamehota-=-"
1,"Stinks. Really stinks. No, seriously, it really stinks.","(1) The writing stinks. Example: ""This evil one is trying to kill me! But I am a greater master of the Force than he."" Really. That's what it says. Seriously. Example 2 : ""More Jedi. But they are only women."" To which Leia responds, ""Vardna Mojaya! You've hurt Luke."" Did he not know that? (2) The plot stinks. DEI brought back the emperor from the dead and armed him with the usual superweapon. DEII (surprise!) brings back the emperor from the dead and arms him with a superweapon. Excuse me? Didn't we just see that in the last episode? Can you spare an original idea? (3) The artwork stinks. None of the characters look like the actors. Each frame has only 1 or 2 colors, which are either garish or washed out. (4) Why is almost everything green? In sum, don't waste your money."
4,Dark Empire 2 is good so read it.,Dark Empire 2 was good book because I like books that don't take a lot of time on making sure the character's nose is just right or the eye's. The characters were crisp and clean drawn. A real good story line too. Write back if you agree or disagree with what I am Saying.
2,The Immortal Emperor,"Boy, as much as I love Star Wars, some authors sure come up with dumb ideas. I had just gotten over the Star Wars Christmas special and Han's party in ZORBA THE HUTT's REVENGE (oh, so hardened smugglers drink ""zoochberry juice), when I found Dark Empire II. For starters, the title just shows how lazy Veitch and his editors are. Emperor Palpatine's death was the climax of Return of the Jedi and was the moment was marked the redemption of Anakin Skywalker and the fall of the Empire. So what does Veitch do? Resurrects our favorite despot...over and over and over. And I have to admit that the World Devestators were a decent concept (much more efficient than a Death Star). But the Galaxy Gun is just plain stupid. Especially since the Galaxy Gun ends up colliding with the aptly named Eclipse II, destroys Byss, and makes me wonder why I spent the money. Thanks alot Tom Veitch."
3,Star Wars -Dark Empire II- (Seafire12),This is just an excuse to make a trilogy. The first chapter in this series was good enough and didn't need to be drawn out into three graphic novels. There is no excitment because the plot is lame and the same from Dark Empire. It's all about huge weaponry that could destroy the galaxy.
1,Someone wanting to make money off of Star Wars,"The first book was mildly interesting, but Veitch really has no grasp of what Star Wars is. It's not creating better and better weapons and making things look more and more hopeless. It's about people pulling together to overcome the odds. The way they portray the Emperor is highly implausible. If he could make Dark Jedi with a mere touch he should have been able to obliterate the Rebellion without a thought the first time. And I doubt that all the warlords are going to just stop fighting each other and join up with the first person that comes along claiming to be the Emperor. Where does he get all these resources? All in all it looks like someone wanted to cash in on the Star Wars resurgence and decided one book wasn't enough. Lots of nice art and action, but annoyingly little substance. Veitch saddled a lot of good authors with his poor plot, forcing them to acknoweldge his ideas to preserce continuity. It's a shame."
3,Daker Star Wars but still Fun!,"I know some people aren't big fans of the Dark Empire stories. But for the most part, it's still good Star Wars fun. Yes, DE is a bit darker than the original films. Yes, DE2 rehashes much of DE1...but Cam Kennedy's art is worth it!If you like Star Wars and like solid, unique graphic art, DE2 is worth picking up. HOWEVER, I will say, I picked mine up from Amazon used. Not sure I'd pay full price for it."
4,Great stuffed animal,Very cute meerkat toy. His hands at sewn together but they can easily but cut apart (they are connected by some string).
3,It was okay,I bought the sunshine seat-shade because my 4 months old son was having problems with the sun in his face.I think it is okay but not excellent....Doesn't fit the way you see in the picture...bumps all the time when you close thedoor...but it is better then before..The product has a reasonable price...I would recommended to someone that doen't have much expectations.
2,Good for title song only,"I'm an old guy, but the very first record I ever got was a Christmas present from my sister called Telstar by the Tornadoes. Still have it and still love it. So, when I saw this CD, I thought, ""Wow! I can listen to it without 40 years of static!"" I'm very disappointed in the pressing, very trebly and sloppily mastered, or maybe that's the way it originally sounded, and I have only a nostagia-attached feeling toward it. Surely, there's a better pressing somewhere. This one stinks."
4,Really Enjoyable,"The Pocket Machiavelli was a great addition to my philosophy collection. Machiavelli has some very interesting viewpoints on statesmanship and warfare. If you like social and political philosophy, you should definitely give this book a try as it provides a number of Machiavelli's works for a very good price in convenient size."
5,An inside look at a true scientist,This book gives one a real sense of what the natural world is like through the eyes of a very influential naturalist. This book follows the life of E.O. Wilson from childhood to show how the outside world impacted his life. A great read!!
3,more for the specialist.,"This autobiography is more for the professional biological scientist, who should really enjoy the detailed description of the many field works of the author. Although his reflections on aggression, behaviourism (for him grossly overstated), and sociobiology are a worth-while reading.He confesses that he became far too late an environmental activist.I can only subscribe his fundamental truths: first, humanity is the product of biological evolution; second, the diversity of life is the craddle and greatest natural heritage of the human species; and third, philosophy and religion make little sense without taking into account these two first conceptions.Another silver lining in his professional life: his struggle with colleagues, jealousy, slander, undermining of his position, covert attacks (Harvard is not a monastery)."
1,impossible to change bobbin,"Purchased as a Christmas gift. It came ready to go. Sewed perfectly until it was time to change the bobbin, which was absolutely impossible. 5 adults tried (I sew, my husband is mechanical, my mom is a professional seamstress). I took it to our local Singer store and they could not figure out how to get the bobbin out. They finally pryed it open with a butter knife! It is a lovely little machine with a cute pink foot pedal. My mom actually chose this because she is an expert seamstress and thought it would be a good little starter for her grand daughter. It is light weight, portable and has similar working to an adult machine. What a bummer, it was returned promptly but I had to pay shipping both ways. Possibly we just got a defective machine, but I would highly recommend actually changing the bobbin on this and testing every function before you buy. We are now researching an inexpensive adult machine because all other kids machines did not pass the ""grandmom test""."
5,Soda springs,Awesome movie. It is nice to have a real story line with some twists! Kept my attention. Pickett was great.
4,A goodlooking guy.,This movie is very good but kind of slow. I feel for Eden as he is not treated the way he should have. He payed for a crime he may have not of caused. It ends very well. I hope you enjoy it
2,Not worth the time.,"Sorry, but you can avoid this one. Staccato dialog delivered by wooden actors for the most part. The two female leads were the only ones who appear to know how to deliver a line, even as bad as it is sometimes. And to give Tom Skerritt what amounts to top billing for his less than 10 minutes on screen is an obvious ploy to attract viewers, which it did for me. The storyline deserved better writing, better acting, and better production values. Unless you're out of things to watch, let this one go."
5,Great book for anyone interested in screenwriting,I am an aspiring screenwriter just looking into the field. I have have not yet taken any courses but would love to learn about screenwriting. This book is the perfect for that. It is fascinating reading about the basic structure of a screenplay in terms that even I can understand. The analysis of Hollywood movie screenplays is a great way to teach the process through example. Reading a few of the negative reviews made me wonder if those people understood the purpose of this wonderful book. It was not written with the idea that is was to help Steven Speilberg with his work. It was written for you and me. Based on that it has to be a 5 star book. Simply fascinating.
3,No TV shows,"A book claiming to tell you how to adapt ""anything"" into a screenplay should have a bit more than books, short stories and plays. I mean, books and short stories are basically the same kind of thing! While it does have an example of comic book adaptation (X-Men), it doesn't have anything about adapting a serial or TV-show. Since this is a fairly common form of adaptation (e.g. The Flintstones, SWAT, Firefly) I am somewhat disappointed. Some of the legal advice was useful but also incomplete."
2,No Credits on IMDB?,"As a new screenwriter trying to soak up all the information I can about writing, I bought this book and was disappointed. I started to raise my eyebrow a bit in the beginning of it and so I went the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com) to see what screenplays the author had written so that I could assure myself that this guy actually knew what he was talking about, but he had no writing credits at all! Not even ""Glitter"" or ""Gigli"" - even as bad as those are, at least that would mean that he has actually written a script that got picked up which would then give him the right to teach me a few lessons. I re-read the back of the book and it says that he is a professor of screenwriting. It was at that point that I put this book down for good and reminded myself of a famous quote, ""Those who can't do, teach."""
2,THE hOLLYWOOD GRIST MILL,"The author has many accomplishments under his belt in the industry and the book may prove useful to those whose goal is to write a screenplay acceptable to that industry that churns out mostly mediocre fare. To anyone who has even a glimmer of artistic pretension, it will prove dissapointing. Two lines jumped out at me. ""Some people feel that because there is an accepted way of doing something, they need to do things differently. This is not a sign of genius, but merely a sign of a severe problem with authority'And my thoughts turn to Griffith,Wells,and Shakespere,Ibsen, and Sravinsky,Messian and,Parker,Coltrane,and Hendrix,Dylan, and Darwin,Freud,and, VanGough,Picasso Surly all displayed signs of problems with authority."
4,Excellent working writer's guide,"Richard Krevolin has concisely put into print a set of principles that deserves a place on your bookshelf next to Hauge and McKee, and, if followed will guide you to tell your story in the most effective and screenworthy manner. This book will fuel your passion as well as provide the guiding principles you can use to adapt pre-existing works or your own original stories.Richard BagdazianPresident, San Diego Screenwriters' Association"
5,Can't find it. Want to buy it,I am looking for this video to purchase. I would like a copy of this video. If you know where I can find it please let me know.
3,My all time favorite movie but read below for the 3 stars which you might already know,"OK,At first I can understand peoples complaint. Why did rhino put out a very clean print of the movie and finally on dvd it is [...]. That is the only complaint I have. Now if the dvd came out first and it was a bad print then we would assume that they could not do anything about it, but I dont believe like the one man said about the dvd not having much money to make a good print. Well Rhino isnt a HUGE money company as well but at least they put effort in restoring the print or getting a clean print. Therefore I am a little ashamed of this dvd. Only issue I have is, who really has the right to it? rhino or Trauma? But that is not the really big topic. I would just like to ask rhino, where the hell did they get the clean print which trauma states they had the only print in the world."
4,The Children rocked,"I saw this when I was about 11 on HBO, and I loved it. This was a classic horror movie, and I wish they would release it on DVD! HINT HINT"
1,The Children,"I was so excited about the DVD release of ""The Children"" This is one of my favorite childhood films. I cannot believe what Troma did to this classic. If the cheesy introduction didn't make you mad the copy will. I have never seen such a horrible Remaster or as they call it. It is utterly impossible to believe that they had gotten one of the ""only surviving prints"" of this movie. Considering it was shown in over 3000 movie theaters when released. My hope is that another print will surface; and another company gets ahold of it; and finally gives this classic movie the proper DVD release it deserves."
3,Kids these days...,"A toxic cloud of gas transforms a busload of schoolchildren into zombies that can incinerate their victims with a touch.This is an ultra-low-budget film with a rather silly premise that nevertheless managed to hold my interest. The story unfolds over the course of a few hours and the way the protagonists race from scene to scene, trying to understand and then cope with the crisis, gives it some good narrative drive. The fact that it was children doing the killing and being destroyed in return also provided a certain level of horror (although I must admit that I projected this; the filmmakers did a poor job of exploiting that aspect). Gorehounds should be warned: despite a high body count, the graphic violence is limited to some poorly done burn makeup and severed mannequin hands."
2,the children,"what a bad copy, they say it was remastered i like to know with what, my old video tape looks better, than the dvd, what a crappy copy of a classic film, go back and redo this film, the way it should be, dont waste your money or your time, with this bad copy"
2,The Children,Not one of Troma's better movies as I have quite a few. It was different. It was ok. Dale.
2,The Children,"It ain't Shakespeare, that's for sure. The only way to watch the piss-poor supposed re-mastering of The Children is Mystery Science Theater-style with a batch of mixed drinks and a group of friends who all share a fondness for bad cinema. The tacky late-70's/early-80's fashions are a hoot though...and a pregnant character huffing on a cigarette sent us into hysterics. This review is strictly for rental purchases only. Troma blatantly lied about the quality of this release and anyone foolish enough to purchase a copy after reading the last couple of reviews, deserves to lose their money."
4,Great mindless entertainment,"C'mon people, it's titled ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"". What did you expect, Les Miserables? It's fun and entertaining. Glad I watched it."
3,Ok for an escape,"But I found it really hard to suspend disbelief on this one. It was entertaining, but I found the premise a bit silly."
4,go for it,if you like this type/genre of movie this one does a good job. good story line with a load of action. nicely done in my opinion.
4,Great story,"This movie had a great premise : President Lincoln's secret life as a vampire hunter that history never taught children in school.We get to see young Abe and how he stumbled into the world of vampire hunting to his romance and marriage to his wife and finally the Presidentcy.The acting was top notch along with the production values, highly recomend."
4,Better than expected,"Of the negative reviews, I didn't find any to be true. The acting was decent to strong. The picture and storyline were pretty good."
4,Loved It,"Good Movie, second time i watched it. A different side of young Lincoln. May purchase the movie after all. A little bloody, but okay"
1,TERRIBLE!,The movie was terrible and did not follow the book at all. I would not recommend this movie period. Terrible do not waste your time. The book was outstanding!!!!
5,Something Not Expected,"The idea of one of the greatest presidents to actually be a vampire killer is a bit bizzare and out of the ordinary. But surprisingly I liked the action and theme to the movie. There were good special effects and had good action scenes, even if it all may be fiction of course :)"
2,Amazon and Roku issues,We had to quit watching the show because there was an issue with Amazon working with Roku players that day.
3,Well done,"I am not a big fan of vampires books or movies, but this one was well done and the story line was interesting"
4,Oh Mr. Lincoln,"Not Bad, It did what it was bought for. Entertain me. I will never look at Mr. Lincoln the same again"
1,Horrible!,"I've read this book several times and was very excited to say the least when I learned that they made a movie. Tim Burton completely ruined it. It was so far off the book that they shouldn't have used the title. Horrible horrible horrible. I was so pissed off that if I ever run into Tim Burton in going to give him a piece of my mind. If you liked the book as I did, you'll hate the movie. What a shame... I want my $ back"
1,A dearth of humor begets fatuity,"Nothing so intrinsically silly ought be presented in as humorless a manner as that of Timor Bekmambetov's latest waste of film, an adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's amusing revisionist novel. Scarcely any of the author's droll wit is preserved in transition; this movie is exciting as an extravaganza of stylized combat, yet divested of its source material's facetious character, ultimately nothing more than inadvertently vacuous. At present, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a rarity among Anglophone screen actresses: personable, talented, a paragon of comely femininity. She's aptly cast as Mary Todd, but as so often before, her charm can't salvage an unappealing production, especially one in which a fun premise and ample talent are squandered beneath a discernibly artificial excess of CG."
1,Crap,Terrible movie. Don't waste your time. Horrible movie. Don't spend your time watching. It's terrible.gdsfgszdgzdsfgdfgdfhgddd gfbfdgbhdfgh fgbdfbgdfg vvgdfbdf dfbdfbdfgb dfbdfgdfg dfbhfgfb dfgbdfbg
1,SEQUEL when you've had enough.,"What a terrific concept. As if the life story with this country's signature events-the Civil War & the emancipation of those born in lifelong bondage- isn't fertile enough material for the imagination. If I were Roger Ebert I would write ""I hated, hated, hated, hated this concept"" but being an ordinary mass culture addict with time, a credit card, a childish sense of curiosity and no discerning sense of taste, I went to see this movie. Perhaps it's a childhood indoctrinated with respect for a president during our most trying years as a country but I was unable to slip into that zone of acceptance where I enjoy science fiction or horror or for that matter 98% of films. I kept thinking, ""What's next? George Washington - Porn Star!"""
4,Action packed,This was a surprisingly good movie. Fun fiction about a beloved figure in history. We watched it twice and found it very enjoyable.
2,Fun action. Not much content,"The movie had some fun action in it, which actually got a little repetitive. The acting was mediocre at best. I wish I'd read the book first. I am sure it was much better."
4,Not historically accurate...,but good fun all the same. I must admit. I'm a fan of material where the writer learns history. Then makes an alternative past. These are usually the works that test my knowledge of what actually happened and intrigue me to find out if it's a piece of history I didn't know. This was a piece of history I know and the rework was just as interesting for entertainment as what actually happened was for knowledge. A good solid piece that I enjoyed watching multiple times. My only complaint is it felt short in the end. I wanted to see more of what was going on and more of what happened before hand. But I was satisfied overall.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I bought this movie after my sister recommended it. I love vampire movies and while they tried to take the vampire legend in a different direction, I didn't like that direction at all. Sometimes a weak story is over powered by so much special effects and CGI. That happened here."
1,What is this I don't even,"Rented this because the bf wanted to see it, and I thought maybe it was going to be a little irreverent and self-deprecating because come on, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter, y'all. But no, the movie played it entirely seriously. But, on the other hand, I can also appreciate movies that are so bad they're good. This movie unfortunately isn't one of them. It's just plain bad."
2,Good movie but the effects....,"Really great vampire movie in 2013... i like the old civil war style, the clothes and the art the vampires act. The bad thing about it are the computer effects in some scenes which really look totally unrealistic. If you like this stile of vampire movies check out this http://amzn.to/UEyurb"
4,Great Movie,I thought it would take longer to arrive but it did not. Fabulous job. Keep up with the great job you guys are doing
1,A seriously goofy story,A seriously over the top goofy concept with the seriousness of a drama. My wife and I didn't think the concept worked very well and ended up skipping through the last half. Do yourself a favour and spend your time elsewhere.
4,self,I bought this because the previews looked like it was going to be good. I like vapire movies. It as a good movie
5,Great Movie,"Really enjoyed this movie. I never would have thought that I would like a movie like this, and thought Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, you've got to be kidding right! But after seeing this action packed movie, I thought, Yeah, Abraham Lincoln, the Vampire Hunter!! Really a different slant on History, but a very entertaining Movie! My husband , too, didn't want to watch it, but we all were glad that we did. So I purchased this movie for my son as a gift , he loves History and this is a really neat twist."
3,Typical comic book movie.,This was about what I expected. A typical comic book turned movie and its accompanying corny dialogue and mediocre CGA.
3,Interesting...in a way.,"The guys who thought this up were really out there. I would never have put two such different characters together. All in all it was a really well thought out movie and I liked how they integrated much of the past history into this fantasy. I'd recommend this film but definitely not for kids, it is very graphic."
3,"Good Movie, Great Book","After reading the book, I was a bit disappointed as the movie did not give much of the backstory of the why A.L became a vampire hunter. But it was ok"
3,Meh...,"It wasn't terrible...but also far from good. In fact, I've already forgotten what happened and I just watched it a few days ago."
3,I just hope they make Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"Don't spend more than a dollar on this movie and watch it with friends with plenty of alcohol just to make it all the more economical and entertaining, but it is certainly entertaining. You kinda get the sense fairly quickly that the filmmakers fully understood that it was a terrible flick and still plowed ahead with a wink and a grin, inviting laughs at some pretty ridiculous plot points (like jumping from horse to horse during a stampede that just happens to be teetering at the edge of a cliff). Couldn't really tell if they were trying too hard to make it what they might have thought was awesome or if they didn't really give a damn how silly it was, but that ambiguity really adds to the entertainment value. Really could have done without some pretty gratuitous religious themes, but unfortunately that happens sometimes. But if you're bored and need to watch something stupid when under the influence, look no further."
4,Lincoln Vampire Killer,More enjoyable then I expected. Successful attempts at humor. Action scenes enjoyable. I would recommend this movie for an evening of mindless viewing pleasure.
1,ABEPLOITATION,"Neither goofy nor satiric. Just a plain dumb concept in order to make a buck.What will Hollywood think of next?""Elizabeth: drag queen""? ""George Washington: wigged martian""? ""Adolf Hitler: borscht belt comedian""?"
2,Not so good,"We read the book, so were ready to watch the movie. Let's just say the movie changed almost every interesting part of the book. The movie was not a fun ride at all. Very cheesy. Should have stuck to the original story."
1,Had potential and blew it,"This had potential and blew it. It was possible to capitalize on Lincoln's great strength, historic time frame, and the vampire craze...but this movie missed the mark and came off as just plain ridiculous."
1,It was not a good movie,"I read the book. The book is probably too long to have the movie follow it but the movie gets way off track from the book. It felt like they were hurrying through the movie at each stage and so the character development was poor, the build ups to the clashes were nill and the action sequences were not very exciting.The acting was good.... and that is about all that was good about this movie."
1,Didn't plan on watching this...,"And now I know for sure why. Just terrible really. Maybe a few decent scenes but overall do not waste your money. If you got to see this for whatever reason, then wait until it is FREE."
1,Just Dumb,"The idea was appealing but the execution was not up to the idea. To campy, to boring and many times the acting was embarrassing."
3,Abraham Lincoln; Vampire Hunter,"Although curious about how a man could justify developing a movie concerning a vampire and one of our Greatest Leaders I chose to watch the movie anyway. The acting and script were great. Over all this the movie was worth watching. The plot was extraordinary, exciting and interesting. I would encourage anyone enjoying Vampire movies and history to rent via Amazon Prime."
1,Awful,"No spoilers:Horrible plot with the Civil War backdrop, special affects were cheezy computer graphics my 6 year old nephew could do. Save time by throwing the money you were going to pay for this out the window of your fast moving car. At least then all you are out is the money and not 2 hours of your life. I could go into greater detail about how awful this movie is but I would spoil it for those who truely want to never get 2 hours of thier life back."
3,What you never knew about Honest Abe.,I thought it was pretty enjoyable for the most part. Definitely something good to watch if you want a little humor mixed with action and bits of history.
1,Dreadful,"I haven't read the book, but expecting a movie with Abe Lincoln and vampires, I felt I had the frame of mind for it. It was awful, pale horror delivered in a graphic novel style. I fell asleep.My wife, who had read and loved the book, hated it for the dumbing down of the novel's highlights. She was bitterly disappointed."
4,VH Lincoln,"Very entertaining, good action! This is not an academy award winning movie but you will burn 2 hrs of time."
3,Entertaining but not good.,Fight scenes are entertaining but other than that it is entirely too predictable and the characters are shallow and poorly acted for the most part.
4,Loved it,"loved it, Tim Burton style, made the Lincoln story darker and more fun to think about, I recommend this movie"
5,loved it!,I can totally see this movie teaching kids some historical things while holding their interest and making it fun!!! Great movie actually going to buy a copy!
3,Ok movie,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, because he wanted to see it when it was in theaters, but didn't get a chance. He said it was ok. He said it was really gory, but he doesn't mind that."
3,Just enjoy,"Abe Lincoln is a pretty solid action flick. If you remember your history you'll enjoy a lot of the references, but don't expect a campy gore fest. This movie takes its story pretty seriously. Having said that, it is a vampire movie with Abe Lincoln as the protagonist so set your expectations accordingly. As I read other reviews here that may be the problem. Expectations. When the movie is called Abe Lincoln Vampire Slayer, I think a lot of people are going to expect something funny or way over the top. This is not that movie. Don't get me wrong, it's serious but not realistic. It is a good action movie about killing vampires. Just sit back and enjoy."
5,great movie in 3d,movie works great and arrived on time it looks great in 3d i use this movie alot special features are great too.
2,Dumb movie!,"Not sure why I rented this in the first place, but this movie is horrible. The story just lacks everywhere and is just plain ridiculous."
4,"refreshing, unique good story line","We thought it was refreshing, unique good story line and had many exciting over the top effects. As long as you can get over it being our president abe lincoln in our history books it is worth watching. I'm not saying it a must see outstanding movie.... but it is worth watching if you like vampire movies in which the vamps don't sparkle in the sunlight. Happily It's not a teen vamp movie. Dark and gritty."
4,Abe killing vamps is good stuff,I was a little surprised to find out there was a story in this movie. It was better than I expected and I enjoyed the movie with my girl one night.
4,Not an acadamy award but a great nights entertainment.,"That was a good escape night movie, slightly of reality enough to have fun watching and not looking for historical errors. Good for the night you want action and entertainment, not mindless, selfish reality show with vain children throwing tantrums."
5,Great movie!,Great item for the money and i look forward to renting from Amazon in the near future. I wish i bought the item and did not just rent it.
3,ok,i didn't really care for the movie. but everyone to its own. I fell asleep if that tells you anything
3,Strays too far from the book....,"If you have read the book, don't try to compare the two. The book is MUCH better. While it's an entertaining movie it did very little to follow the book. I mean, it follows it in the sense that in both the movie and book, Lincoln kills vampires. And that's where the comparison ends.I don't want to give much away for those that haven't seen it but there are a lot of parts that they added and important parts in the book (I feel) that they should have included in the movie that they didn't.If you are looking for an entertaining movie then by all means rent it but its not worth buying in my opinion."
3,Just OK for me,"Not bad, not good, vaguely entertaining. fourteen more words required event hough I already said what I wanted to say."
3,"Cool CGI, story was a little dull","This movie didn't really keep my attention. Maybe an ok movie to watch around Halloween, otherwise I wouldn't waste my time."
3,Eehh,Mildly entertaining It kinda embarrasses me that I rented it since its kind of an absurd story line but wasn't too bad
2,Meh,"I'm not one to just give up on a movie if it doesn't get my attention right away so I honestly gave this movie a chance. While the movie wasn't awful, it just didn't do anything for me. It just seems a bit too random for me to be anything but maybe a comedy. We have Abe Lincoln and he wants to kill vampires. Not sure if they were being serious or not but it's one of those things where it was like they wanted to make a vampire movie but wanted to try and take it to the next level so they thought ""Hey let's make Abraham Lincoln the vampire hunter"". The acting was actually pretty good, which salvaged the movie for me to at least be able to finish it. It's just the premise that I couldn't buy for a movie in this genre. Not a terrible movie by any means, just didn't do it for me. A friend of mine loved the movie, so yeah completely subjective."
3,Just OK,"I thought it was just OK. My daughter, her boyfriend and her college friends enjoyed it more than I did,"
3,Wasn't really sure what to expect...,"It was a good movie, the actors did a solid performance. I really liked how they blended Abe's documented history in with the fiction of a vampire hunter. I cannot say that blown away, but if you want to try it out, go for it. It held my interest the whole way through and I was working on solving a puzzle at the same time. I failed at the puzzle as I was more interested in the movie."
3,Better than I expected,"My expectations for this were pretty low, so it was a bit surprising that I found this movie mildly entertaining."
3,OK.,"Too much political BS in this film to make it fun. Im into history as well as horror and sci-fi, it's either one or the other not both, I believe this film could have been a much better movie as just a horror film with out th politics, was it written by a leftist?"
3,"For what it is, not bad","Given the plethora or vampire related movies/shows in the last 15 or so years, you really have to go the extra mile to stand out from the crowd. This movie's premise is quite unique, but the acting and action and effects are merely average."
2,read the book and had high expectations of a great movie but......,this movie was NOT as good as the book was!!!! I wasn't blown away by it. if you read the book DON'T waste your time watching this movie because it is not at all true enough to the books greatness!!! very disappointed...hope they do a remake and actually follow the books story!!
4,"Fun action packed romp, as long as you don't expect too much.","This was a fun premise that I wasn't expecting too much out of from the start. That being said, it definitely exceeded my expectations. The only thing I wanted more of was vampire killing!"
4,Unexpected---it was great film,"I really liked this, it was a good story and fun to watch. Not a genre I would normally pick, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it."
5,Ridiculously Fun,"This movie ruled. The 3D is some of the best I've seen (including Prometheus and Avengers.) If you're going into this expecting a whole lot of serious business, you're probably watching the wrong movie."
4,Most unique film I have seen this year,"The story is self explanatory with the title of the movie. My only real complaint was that the 3D was not as good as I have seen in other movies. Definetely a unique addition to your library, and in interesting movie. I felt before watching this movie it was going to be cheesy, but the tone of this movie is serious, which for this movie works really well. Only lost one star because I felt the 3D could have been better."
4,Interesting twist on history,I thought it was an interesting/alternative view on history. Special effects were really good and acting was well done!You just never know....
4,Good movie.,Didn't go see this in the theater. I'd say its a good rental to watch. Storyline kind of moved too quickly for me.
4,Movie,"I almost didn't order this, but then saw some long trailers and decided to try it. I can honestly say I was surprised and enjoyed the movie. It's different to be sure, but I like movies that aren't predictable. A good storyline and very entertaining. I would recommend to friends."
4,HIGHLY CREATIVE and UNIQUE,"I was happily shocked and impressed with how this movie brought together a great twist on history, action and horror. Highly imaginative. Great action sequences. The wild horse stampede chase scene was fantastic and unlike anything I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies at my ripe age. This is well worth a rental, IMO. There are reviews on here that are far better than mine and trust that it is well above average when you see this many raving reviews."
3,A surprising film,"This gritty and surreal film was surprising , i didn't expect a great deal when i read the reviews i watched it with an open mind and was very surprised to find a nice dialog and very nice exciting pace.Don't expect Interview with a vampire or anything of the sort , it is different and its not what your expecting.witty charming and fast paced in places it leaves you drawing parallels throughout the entire film.A bit slow in places and a bit groggy in others but over all a nice little film."
2,Not the Book I Read!,"Im a Burton Fan, but this was way off track. The computer animation was terrible. I feel bad for the actors; as they did their job."
1,Bad Movie...Not worth Watching!,"As I started watching this movie, I only watched 5 minutes of the movie and could not finish watching....I love vampire movies but this was not made well...in my opinion....Why did Hollywood lose their taste in movies that they want to make....they seem to have lost themselves turning every movie into a horror or thriller movie....Come on Hollywood make some decent movies. They are using fairytale stories and making them also as dark as they can and that is not what was expected of the movies. They can't even make a movie that is appropriate for a preschooler, every movie that I have tried to take my daughter to I have walked out of...We do not even go to the theater anymore. We watch certain movies on Netflix so that they can be appropriate for her."
1,AWFUL,"This film is pure 3D special effects and vampire killing, with some filler of a backstory. After investing almost 30 dollars in it, i found it too boring to finish, and i have finished some horrible movies. I actually turned it off.It's possible I'll come back to this at another time and enjoy it. That has happened with more than one movie I detested originally. But right now I seriously doubt this is going to be one of them."
1,Horrible movie,I like action movies even if the plot for the movie is not really great. I do not consider myself to be picky as long as there is plenty of action. Lincoln was an exceptional individual and I did not read the actual book. But the movie is so ridiculous with Lincoln hammering vampires with a big axe??? I was watching it in 3D on a big screen but at the end of the movie I felt like this movie is really-really dumb. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Not Good,"This ruined the premise of the book, I am not sure why the writer signed off on it, another sign that when Producers get input on a film or directors think people just like cool camera angles and forget the story you end up with this crud."
3,It's Okay,It's not as awful as the name would have you believe. It was a good action flick that satisfies the lovers of the genre. Many things were predictable but if you like the genre then you'll like this flick.
2,Book was much better!!!,This would have been better off not being made into a movie. Too many details left out that made the story.
3,Meh,It was alright if you have nothing better to do. Lincoln killed hundreds of thousands so a few vampires were probably no big deal..
1,Love the historical accuracy of the story - in the book,"The book was an interesting read. In fact, I made a comment to a colleague about how much research must have had to go into the writing of this book. It was almost weird, but kept me reading until the end. I was excited to see how the movie would play out and allude to the historical markers of Abe Lincoln's life, unfortunately, I was disappointed. It is just another vampire movie with scenes that are meant to scare the hell out of you instead of show the duality of what might have been Lincoln's other life.I would not spend another $1.99 to see if I knew then, what I know now."
2,Abe and the vamps,Well the story stuck with the facts of general history with a bit of writers imagination thrown in for entertainment. This film just not didn't get a double run through the script. It was OK but not to be reccomended to anyone. A good B movie.
3,Fine movie,"I've read the book this movie is based on, and while the book is great the movie isn't quite as good. Still entertaining though."
3,Books was Much Better,"We preferred the book to the movie. Lots of graphic violence in the movie which isn't necessarily bad, but leaves nothing to the imagination. Ending was too campy."
5,Awesome,"This movie was way beyond my expectations. I went in thinking, ""Okay, a low budget ultraviolence movie with good enough actors to keep me from walking out."" Then I watched it. OMG!!! This movie rocked. Not only was the action absolutely fun to watch, but it kept you in the moment from begining to end. The acting was way better than I had even contemplated it ever being, I even shed a couple tears at the end of it. No spoiler alert from me... BUY IT!!!"
2,The book was WAY better,"Most people I know who read the book loved the way the author seamlessly blended historical facts with fiction to make a really fun story. I could not put the book down.Not only did the movie leave out most of the back story that could help you understand why Abe was driven to hunt vampires, it reduced it to a large train explosion. I had a hard time believing the same author who wrote such an awesome book wrote this crummy screenplay. It even left out Abe's assassination and the twist at the end of the book.I love action movies and escapist entertainment as much as the next guy, but this movie really dumbed down a great story to something not really worth your time to watch.Read the book. It's way more fun."
