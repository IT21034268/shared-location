3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"RAZORBLADE SUITCASE got some good songs like COLD CONTAGIOUS, GREEDY FLY, SWALLOWED and PERSONAL HOLLOWAY...but compared with Sixteen Stone, this one got many songs that i really don't care...The next BUSH album the science of things is way better..."
3,"This album is good, but.....","Compared to their first album, this is not even worth listening to. I would buy this album if you were a die-hard Bush fan..but the first CD is much MUCH better."
2,Definetly not like their debut,"Bush's debut album is so much better than this dissapointing follow up. Sixteen Stone is full of hit songs that you hear on the radio. That is what Razorblade Suitcase is missing, those #1 catchy hits like Little Things. The only songs on here reminding me of the old Bush are Mouth and Greedy Fly. If i were you i would wait around their next CD."
5,THIS CD ROCKS!!,"GAVIN'S SWEET SOOTHING VOICE WILL SEND YOU ON AN EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER. THIS CD, ALTHOUGH NOT AS GOOD AS SIXTEEN STONE, STILL RULES. BUT OF COURSE ANYTHING BY BUSH WILL!"
1,This is garbage pure and simple,"bush lyric.... Do you feel the way you hate? Do you hate the way you feel... Wow that's real heady stuff there gavin,,, like psychology must have been your speciality before you became the head of a really unimportant band......"
2,This album isn't really that good.,"I bought this cd, expecting a masterpiece like sixteen stone. It isn't. The cool guitar sound is gone (remember ""Everything Zen""?) and it sounds like they are playing in a garage. The vocals and the musical quality pretty much turned to crap. I say this even though I am a huge fan of bush, but this cd simply doesn't measure up. If you wan't to really experiance bush, buy Sixteen Stone."
3,not half as good as sixteen stone,This CD wasn't half as good as Sixteen Stone. I was very disappointed.
3,"Cold, but not contagious.","I actually do like ""Bush"", but this album is just mediocre. The highlights are the tracks ""Greedy Fly"" and ""Swallowed"", those are both pretty good. But the rest of the songs just aren't that great, or memorable anyway. Plus the version of ""Mouth"" on here is the inferior, and non-radio one. My suggestion would be to get this used, or get ""Sixteen Stone"", which will probably always be their best cd. Or you could wait until the inevitable ""Greatest Hits"" comes out, which should be soon."
5,Best Bush Ever,"I listened to this twice and realized it was one of the best cds I have ever heard....my first reaction was changed from ""it's pretty good"" to ""it's my favorite CD"" after repeated play...they KICK!!..."
3,WHAT HAPPENED!,"After two years of the release of Sixteen Stone we were all waiting for something great. Razorblade Suitcase is okay but it gets kind of boring right after ""Swallowed"" and that's too early in the CD. ""Greedy Fly"" is a good reason you should get this CD, but if you have another Cd in your mind, get that one."
2,What a dissapointment!,"Dont waste your twelve dollars on this cd! I listened to the science of things which wasn't that bad so I got this one, and when I listened to it I wanted to return it right away! Only get this cd if your a REAL bush fan!"
1,Blow it Away!,This cd is by far the worst bunch of recorded music ever.I don't think it should even have one star.What the hell is a Personal Holloway anyway?
4,Another smash set from 16 Stoners,"While this is not as successful as their debut, they still had at least four hit songs: ""Swallowed"", ""Greedy Fly"", ""Cold Contagious"" and ""Mouth"".If you were a fan of Sixteen Stone, this should be another welcome addition to your collection. After this cd, Bush kind of lost popularity and released two relatively weak records, at least compared to their first two. I would start with this and 16 Stone, and then try out the others. I consider this another must-own hard rock/grunge cd."
3,i love mouth,"mouth is the reason i love this cd. sure, there's other good songs on here, but mouth is my favorite. it's probably my favorite song by bush out of all their albums. so yeah if you don't have another cd you want to buy, get this one. it's not the greatest, but mouth is."
3,"OK, but nothing special","A few years ago, I used to love this CD. I listened to it all the time. I recently found and listened to it again, and I fail to see what I liked so much about it. Don't get me wrong, it's not that it's a bad CD, but there's nothing especially good about it. I just can't really get into the songs. Bush is great for background music, but not much else. I do like this album better than the Science of Things, though."
5,The great bush does it again!!!,"Ah, what a great CD. The lyrics are fab,the beat is cool, and the band rocks!!! My personal fav songs are ""Swallowed"" and ""Mouth"". Ive been a bush fan for a while and they never let me down. Get out and buy it........NOW!!!!! Now, ifI can ge my greedy little hands on there next CD......."
5,Pure Rock,"This is probably my favorite Bush CD. The Guitar playing is great. This band is a mix between the foo fighters and nirvana. If you love rock music (ie metallica, foo fighters, zombie, pearl jam, RHCP) you will love this CD. A ""must buy."""
4,"Pretty good, but I think Sixteen Stone is better","Bush is a pretty good band. Once I heard Sixteen Stone, which was a great cd, I thought this one would be even better. But I don't think it is. Its still worth buying because most of the songs are good. The best songs are ""Swallowed"",""Greedy Fly"",""Cold Contagious"", and ""Personal Holloway""."
2,Disappointing follow-up,"After their excellent debut album ""Sixteen Stone"", I had great hopes for their second attempt. Apart from a couple of very honorable exceptions, the songs on this album are simply tiresome. It's not that they are bad, but they just hasn't anything to remember. The songs just go by without giving you anything. The band play and sing well, but that isn't enough. Get their debut album instead. That's where Bush apparently spent all their creativity to make good tunes."
4,Stuff and Junk,Didnt really want to comment on this cd perse...but just say that Bush was shockingly awesome at woodstock....They may the first night really blow up and Gavin hasnt lost his touch at entertaining(and getting practically naked on stage)......
2,NOT WORTH OWNING,"Let's keep this short and sweet.Bush was a great band. 'Sixteen Stone', 'The Science of Things', and 'Golden State' were great albums. 'Razorblade Suitcase' really was not. I don't know why, but the album just lacks any songs that give you that rush you feel when you hear songs like ""Everything Zen,"" ""Float,"" or ""The Chemicals Between Us."" These and the other songs off their three good albums make you feel something, but Razorblade Suitcase just bores you. At least it did me.With the exception of ""Personal Hollow"" (and okay, maybe ""Swallowed""), this is really not worth checking out. Pick up their other three discs though. You won't be disappointed."
3,Pretty entertaining but loses energy halfway.,"I really don't care weither or not Bush is a ripoff of other bands, so I'll judge this on its own merits.Pros: A highly polished piece of work thats enjoyable if you take the time to listen to it more than a couple times.Some amazing tracks: Greedy Fly, Tendency to Start Fires, Swallowed, History...Cons: Lyrics are still incomprehensible. Are they thinly veiled songs about drug abuse? Poetry too esoteric for me? Or just ramblings of a madman? The world may never know.The worst flaw so far is the way that the album just seems to lose momentum after ""Tendency to Start Fires."" The songs towards the end aren't bad(History is excellent actually), but its hard to not fall asleep.While Sixteen Stone mightve been a mishmash of poorly matched tracks, it did have energy throughout the album, without begging the listener to eject the disc halfway through. Razorblade suitcase is accomplished indeed. Just not that entertaining."
3,Okay...,"This album is not as good as Sixteen Stone, Bush's 1st album. This album almost seems to have taken a step backward in quality and originality. There are a few good songs that stood out, but other than that, I am not really that interested in this CD. A good buy for someone who wants a good Bush collection? Other than that, just look up the popular songs and get those without spending the money on the CD. ""Greedy Fly"" is the only song I can think of right now that stands out as a good one."
5,Very Solid,this is not as good as 16 stone but is still a pretty good album..it has its moments..heres my track ratings...1. Personal Holloway - 9/102. Greedy Fly - 10/103. Swallowed - 10/104. Insect Kin - 7/105. Cold Contagious - 8/106. A Tendency To Start Fires - 6/107. Mouth - 9/108. Straight No Chaser- 8/109. History - 7/1010. Synapse - 9/1011. Communicator - 7/1012. Bonedriven - 8/1013. Distant Voices - 7/10
5,Very nice collection,I love this set... It is put together very well and the sound is awesome. For those who've never heard anything by Battisti - this is a great purchase; a collection of his early work with Mogol - the music that made Lucio so famous in Italy... Brilliant. Many thanks to him for all the love and dedication he gave to this world as a musician...
4,"Basic history, nice illustrations, pictures",Book nicely covers historical aspect and changing economic forces. Fair read if you are somewhat familiar with the outer banks.
3,puzzle gut cd,"i just wanted one song off this cd. the rest of the cd is awful. really dumb songs. But ""i knew it well"" is a great song, was a hit in 1997. is not on you tube or itunes and i wanted this song for my itunes library. it was worth it to me to pay $3.00 for one song!"
2,Actually I have heard of them,"There is some pretty good music work but they can't desguise the fact they can't sing=(. The lyrics are pretty funny, but wasting my money is not=( Luckily, I only spent 1.33 on their cd. That's all its worth."
5,a scientific exploration of people and lies,"This book is wriiten by an MD. Instead of writing about fighting fraud by himself, the author uses more statistics and medical theory to help readers understand why and how people lie, and more importantly, how to work with common lies. I have used some of the skills in this book, and it works."
5,Excellent book,The book is excellent. The author describes the different kinds of personality disorders related to lying. He also writes about the importance of lying in childhood and adolescence as part of the normal emotional development.
5,Elegant,This is a beautiful wall plate. I have these wall plates in every room but couldn't find another triple switch plate. This one matched the others and is a beautiful brushed nickel design. Makes the room look elegant and classy.
3,Economies of scale,"This is a book one would read in graduate school, not for fun. It is well written book that focuses on the economic impact of changes in telecommunications industry since it's conception until now. Sharp and well written, but it takes some effort to read."
4,almost perfect,"these are great slippers. warm, well made, very cushiony with great arch support. i even like the oversized look. they are comfortable in every way but one - there is a little elastic on the heel. it sits too low and makes them feel like they are slipping off your heel every time you take a step. and because it slides up and down on your heel when you walk, if you don't have on socks it irritates the skin. i believe the elastic is there to make them hug your foot and not slip off, but it actually causes the exact opposite. if it were about a half inch higher it might work. if not for that elastic, these would have gotten a glowing 5 stars."
2,Not compatible with arch support inserts,"These are really nice, soft comfy slippers, however,if you use arch supports, they may not work for you.I placed my arch supports in the slippers and thisraised my foot just enough that the heel keptcoming out of the slipper. I had to return them.I had no problems with the return. If not for that,I would have given them 5 stars."
2,sulfa derm,"I was unable to use the Sulfa Derm. It gave my dog terrible diarrhea, she could not tolerate the product."
3,Young Bill Holden & Glenn Ford in Shoot-Em-Up Cowboy Film,"This cowboy picture shows us a very young 22 yrs.old Bill Holden and Glenn Ford at the beginning of their careers at Columbia Pictures. In 1940 they were paid $25.00 per picture, not very much money.Compared to the amount of money Columbia Pictures were taking in, for royalties from the U.S.A. and overseas. It took several years before the actor's requested more money from the studio's."
3,An Okay Western By Two Western Greats,"Texas is not in the league with many of Glenn Ford's and William Holden's great western films. Their other Western together, The Man From Colorado, is much better in every way, but this is not a horrible movie.Ford and Holden play two ex-Confederate soldier who head west to seek their fortune. They initially plot to rob a stagecoach. Things go awry and they split up. When they reunite, Holden has become a seasoned robber and Ford is running a successful ranch. The inevitable conflict ensuses.Claire Trevor, who was in The Desperadoes with Ford, Edgar Buchanan (who's in both the Desperadoes and The Man From Colorado) provide solid support. This movie feels artificial and forced in places, but goes a ways on the strength of its cast."
3,"......""THE EYES OF TEXAS ARE UPON YOU""......YEE-HAW!!!!","Not a bad film at all; in fact, a good western yarn at that...fun seeing Holden and Ford kickoff their Hollywood careers as two Texas roustabouts raising caine...they had a real life friendship throughout their cinematic bonding which millions of their fans are grateful for, me included...too bad we have to age...youth, those were the days, but that's life...get this DVD, you'll enjoy it...1941 saw two [2] mega-stars, who are on their way up and entertain you as Texas cowboys/wranglers of yore....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF"
4,Good old Western,"Glenn Ford and William Holden early in their careers taking different paths in the old west. Lots of action and fun, good performances all around"
2,I should have known....,"Sometimes it's hard to find that our heroes have feet of clay, and I've always admired Heinrich Schliemann, amateur that he was. Here was a millionaire who could have retired on his amassed fortune. Instead, he brought us Troy. But not without problems.It's been noted that his amateur attempts at the relatively new science of archeology may have ruined more than he saved, and perhaps he misidentified Troy. But I've not read up to now that he was full of malice and evil.That is, up to now. In an effort to create a sympathetic portrait of Frank Calvert, this becomes a diatribe against Schliemann. And while Calvert may deserve our sympathy, Schliemann's every action, every move and every THOUGHT is described in the most possible light, often without presenting hard evidence. After 133 pages, it was hard to remember the enthusiasm I had about the subject matter when I ordered the book. I gave up."
5,A great book on a great ship,"John McKay's book is well up to the very high standard set by the ""Anatomy of the Ship"" series and covers HMS Victory in fantastic detail. Anyone interested in the ship (or other sailing warships of the period, which would be similar in detail) and especially anyone interested in building a model of the Victory should add this book to their collection. My one disappointment with McKay is that he didn't include any drawings and only one illustration showing HMS Victory in her pre-1801 condition with her original elaborate figurehead and open stern galleries; the book entirely focuses on her appearance at Trafalgar - admittedly her most famous battle but she was also Sir John Jervis's flagship at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and it would have been useful to have more data on her pre-reconstruction configuration. Another book well worth having on the Victory is C. Nepean Longridge's ""The Anatomy of Nelson's Ships,"" which I also highly recommend."
1,"Great material, poor presentation","A lot of great work went into creating this book. But it has a fatal flaw. Many of the plans cover 2 continuous pages of the book, so some details of the drawings are lost in the binding.There is still a lot of great information to be had, but after spending the cash on a hardback book, it is frustrating to feel like I am going to have to cut the book out of its binding in order to get it to lay flat for the purpose of using the plans. And even then the 2 pages don't line up exactly. This applies to all the hull and deck plans, and I would otherwise give the book 5 stars.The fold out plan mentioned on the cover is just a side view with rigging details.This review applies to the 2010 edition."
2,Disappointed,The description made this book sound much better than it is. I really thought for the Kindle edition it would be organized so you could search the book by artist or year or whatever. It really needs something either in the Table or Contents or in an index where you can click on an artist name and go right to the information on that person. I got the impression from the other reviews that there were small sections for each artist - there are not.Wish I would not have bought this book now - not worth it. Perhaps worth it as a freebie.
3,Can't Say,"I bought this for my wife who loves country music, me othe the other handcan't stand it, so dont use this review to make your decision, seems likeit does have alot of infomation within."
1,hasn't arrived yet,I would love to submit a review but the book hasn't arrived yet making it difficult to complete a review that means anything !
1,Waste of money,"7x35 binoculars are totally useless for astronomy. 35mm lenses don't have very much light gathering ability at 7x magnification. 7x is good for birdwatching, but isn't very good for astronomy. These are cheap birdwatching binoculars you can get at a local deparartment store for under $20.The star charts & interactive astro software is free all over the internet.For astronomy get at least 7x50 to 10x50 binoculars for under $50, & get your star charts for free from the internet, libraries, or schools.I do like the Orion brand name & have bought many products from them, but don't ever by 7x35 binoculars for astronomy, & never pay more than $20 for them."
4,Fabulous!,"Why did I rate this so high? My grandaughter saw this set and really wanted it, so I, of course bought it for her. She hasn't stopped using it. She can identify most constellations, tell me what planets are visible, explain clusters and doubles and much more. All because of this crazy little set. She loves the software that came with it. My only complaint is I have to beat her to the computer because once she brings up ""Starry Nights"" it will be a few hours before I can use it. Best money I ever spent. I just love watching her fascination with astronomy."
2,yikes,worked great for a year or two..very satisfied..! friend bought vtech or some other at the same time...Now all our batteries are on the fritz...the phones have cratered...dammm...meanwhile my friends phones are fine..now i got to buy 4 new batteries at 20 bucks a piece...i think...arrghhI can get another system for the same price....therefore I say beware of the battery
4,better than expected,"It is a good system and easy to set up and use. the only negatives are that you can only have 4 phones, and the message indicator to tell if you have voicemail does not always work properly."
4,Blow Up: a conversation between accordeon and bandoneon,"It takes a while to appreciate this CD mainly because it lacks a rhythm section. By the way, according to me, it's very good value and I strongly suggest it to everyone who likes jazz.Libertango is a masterpiece."
1,Rip Off,"Forget about the quality of music on this disc. It's supposed to have a ""Bonus Track"" consisting of a Sly and Robbie cover of a Madonna tune, but listeners are not instructed where it is on the CD or how to get at it. I know it's there, because when the disc cues up my player says ""75:30"" and as soon as I hit play and the first track starts, the time remaining drops to ""71:25."" I suspect that in order to get to it, you have to have a cheap CD player and get it to rewind ""behind"" track 1. High end CD players will not do this, ever. So between copy protected CD's that won't even play at all on my player, other disc's with ""secret"" tracks like this one, Lamb's ""What Sound"" and Hybrid's ""Sci-fi Mornings"" I'm ready to say the hell with it and stop buying music. It's a matter of principle: this goes back for a refund and I can't recommend that anyone spend a penny on it."
1,Stay Away,"The batteries lasted about a year, and when I went to replacement the cables were too short to replace the batteries without completely dismantling and rebuilding the unit around the batteries.That coupled with the fact that the batteries failed silently (no audible alarm), have me completely turned off from the design/manufacturing of the unit."
4,"michael schenker,s awesome first cd remastered!!","this cd is still great 29 years after it,s release in 1980!michael had just left the scorpions after some of the love drive tour and before that he left ufo as they were mixing the excellent strangers in the night double live master piece album,when in ufo on the obsession tour his flying v was all white..soon after that he created the famous two tone black and white trade mark flying v by the time he was back with the scorpions on the love drive tour...any way this debut album by schenker is chock full of classics such as;armed and ready,cry for the nations,victim of illusion,feels like a good thing and the instrumental into the arena the remastering is very good and the bonus tracks are interesting for the schenker fan this album is a must!"
4,The best guitarist to never break thru.,"Michael Schenker's first solo record after he left UFO. This is a classic hard rock cd, a must have for anyone who loves great guitar playing. Songs like, into the arena, lost horizons, armed and ready, bijou pleasurette, and tales of mystery are my favorite of this 9 song disc. I must say the production of this cd makes Judas Priest's British steel sound like "" The Wall (Bob Ezrin)"". Cry for the nations opening keyboard line sounds like it was recorded on a 12 inch casio. Outside of that song Schenkers gift for writting makes up for the production errors. Just like Uli Roth "" early scorpions "" Al De'meola, Michael Schenker was one of the first neo-classical players on the scene."
4,poor production!,"i bought this album in 1980 when it first came out, and the songs are excellent, but i've always felt the production was pretty weak.i think roger glover is a good producer but i almost feel like he sabotaged michael's first album because it was competing with rainbow's ""down to earth"" record which he produced shortly before this came out. (that album sounded great!)anyway, this is worth picking up just for the extra songs. the live versions of ""armed and ready"" and ""into the arena"" are awsome, as well as the other live songs. the studio songs are demos i guess but are pretty interesting.this album was a great start to a career that kind of got side tracked by poor management, line up changes, and substance abuse problems."
3,"The drummer is my Uncle's brother, no lie!","I knew about this band through family and recieved their first LP, Omniphonic Global Nova, from my uncle. To tell you the truth, it was not very good. It has the some of the same songs as Soak, but raw versions. For this next album, they hired a looper, which is not a good idea. The existing instruments should speak for themselves. Otherwise, it is a decent album with a nice grove. That might be baised though."
5,One of my faves!,"A favorite of mine when I do high energy activities - riding bike, working out, etc. I load this along with The Prodigy, maybe some Rob Zombie, and others for some high impact jams to keep me going.Don't remember how I stumbled upon Soak back then, but they sure did jam back in the day."
5,Best New Band in Years,"Soak is one of the best CDs I've ever heard. The sounds and music are the most intelligent I've heard in years. I can't classify the music as any certain genre, all I know is I love the CD and am looking forward to more. This band is as professional as it gets. If you want to listen to great music - buy the CD! If you want to see a great (high impact) show - go see SOAK."
3,it was okay,this tape had audio and visual problems but could still be watched. description made me think it would be better. delivery was good.
5,"HE WAS THE BEST THEN, AND NOW","This music is so thrilling to listen to, not only because it ""takes us back"" but because he was one of the most best voices in recording history. Every one of these songs on all his albums I love."
4,"Fun, good selection, great music!","I enjoy listening to this CD. It has a nice variety of slow and fast dance songs. I love ""Speak Softly Love"" and track #3 ""Your kind of Love"". Great music :)"
2,UGH,"This book was LOUSY. The one dimensional characters were horrible, but worse was the CONSTANT references to the volga deutch. I was considering starting a drinking game taking a drink every time it was referred to, but decided I would get too drunk. Stupid, stupid book.Having said that, every so often this book had thoughtful insight into the lives of priests."
1,What Happened???,"This was my first time reading a book by Andrew Greeley and I must confess, I had to force myself to finish reading it. I kept waiting for the focus to change back to the case, which didn't happen until the last few chapters.It started off with an explosive case that looks like a promising read, only to be bored by his main character who in his quest to be perfect is extremely arrogant and consistently brags about his conquests with a certain redhead. At times,I found the stereotypes offensive and didn't really find humor in what I assume was supposed to be light comedy at times.I wouldn't waste my time with this book if I knew then what I know now, however, because of the beginning and ending chapters of this book, there is potential for a good writer and I would be willing to give Andrew Greeley another shot. Maybe it was just this book that was so bad?"
4,so damn good,"cheater was a great band that died way too soon... both this record and the ep before it, ""experience all the hate"" were amazing examples of fast depressed punk records that never got the recognition they deserved... the vocals are like a cross between joe queer and something much harder... and the guitar are and drums amazing blazing fast thrash, but always melodic, although this release didn't pack the same punch as the ep, it is chock full of great punk anthems that should have been way better known... even though the lead singer is a former the now disgraced down by law for its obnoxious right wing views, this record is nonpolitical and most of its social political implications are harmless... the ep was semi political and amazing... if you like fast punk in the vein of strung out and older pennywise, or any good melodic or pop punk, both this record and the ep are must haves... damn"
5,"For Aspiring ""Bark""itects","As a lifelong cat lover, I normally would not have glanced at this book, but my nephew, now a Jr. in high school, has chosen Architecture as his career. That, plus his love of dogs, caused me to have a look at the contents of this book as a possible fun gift for him. Glad I did! The imagination, the styling, the artistry, and of course, the LOVE that obviously went into the creation of this book, proved to be a great gift choice for my nephew. Even if there area no canines sharing your life, this would be a great coffee-table book to keep on display for friends and guests to enjoy."
5,Great Buy!,"Great addition to any collection of COWBOY BEBOP!!! A ""MUST HAVE No problems with transaction, ordered on a weekend and within a week or so I had the action figure."
5,HEALTHY EATING,"THIS TACO SEASONING WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME AS AN ALL NATURAL SEASONING THAT I SHOULD USE ON A DIET CALLED HEALTHY LIVING. IT GIVES A REALLY GOOD NATURAL TACO FLAVOR WHEN USED IN MEATLOAF, MEATBALLS, OR JUST REGULAR HAMBURGER. IT HAS NO INGREDIENTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED ON THIS DIET. I AM PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ORDER IT."
5,Best buy 4 your money,I purchased a packet of the taco seasoning and to my suprise it is the best one out there! You must try itI'll never buy anything else.
2,Bland Taco Seasoning,"Tasteless, bland, insipid - how many synonyms do we need to describe this product? No wonder this stuff is rarely seen on store shelves. Stay away, stay very far away..."
4,The joy of inner peace,"Now that I have some practice at Vipassana as taught by S.N. Goenka, I know the experience of inner peace. Fleischman does such a good job at explaining it all - that I find I share his essays with others in order to do justice to what I am beginning to experience within myself. Of course it is of great help to see that this man has years of practice in cultivating a life of inner peace, thus helping one realize that the path is long, but always unbelievably worthwhile."
4,A fascinating and informative Arthurian book,"Morgan is the daughter of Igraine and Gorlais, the Duke of Cornwall. When Uther Pendragon seizes Igraine and kills Gorlais, young Morgan is thrust out into the wider world. Trying to find her way in the world of Dark Ages Britain, her fate proves inescapably linked with that of King Arthur (her half-brother) and his Knights of the Round Table.This book is a sequel to In the Shadow of the Oak King, but can easily be read as a stand-alone book. As with the previous book, magic is limited to telepathy and telempathy. Professor Jones' use of the old customs that would have been present in Arthur's Britain makes for some fascinating and informative reading. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any fan of King Arthur."
3,broke within 5 months,"stopped working soon, manufacture did replace after I shipped, did a f/u several times, shipped to Canada may have taken longer. I don't like the way it fastens to motorcycle, also it has some plastic on transmitter that breaks easily. Hoping that the 2nd one lasts longer."
3,could be better,"Skylink MT 18 -This is a very good product, easy to install and hook up. The only problem is the Handle Bar Clamp - It should be a more adjustable clamp. There is no way to get a positive and secure fit the way the clamo is designed."
4,Switch design poor,Works very well but switch box and hardware very poor. Mounted mine in glove box door. I would have gone with 5 stars if it was being rated on function alone.
5,This cd spoke to my heart,"Kirk Franklin has done a more than superior job with reaching the young people in America. First, with His eye on the Sparrow and now He's Stompin' his way up the billboard tracks. Even though Kirk gets a lot of ""flaque"" from the older less contemporary audience for being ""too secular"" he knows he has a job to do and he will do it well. But, despite Kirk's contemporary side I know that he is a devoted worker for the Kingdom of God. People's intentions for purchasing this cd may have been wrong but, I truly think listening to that sense of worship God will mold and shape their hearts."
5,I loved this album,"God's Property and Kirk Franklin, do so well with the songs. They are touching, and will stick with you all day. I absolutely loved it!"
2,God's Property,I thought this was just a little bit too upbeat for gospel music. Don't listen to it ever.
1,it was so boring that my baby cousin fell asleep sik it was,countinue of summary greatttttttt I give it 100000000000000000000
5,Great music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My first song from Kirk Franklin was Stomp from a CD containing the best Christian music. At that point, I knew I had to get more of his music and I obtained at least 6 other CDs by him. This CD has both extremely happy music and extremely sad music. But, it is very supportive of anybody willing to listen closely to the lyrics and excellent music overall.I have played this many many times in my car and at work."
2,Not all the songs you thought you was purchasing came with the album,I only got 5 songs i did not get all the songs that's suppose to come with the entire album
3,good music,Looking for alternative types of Christian music. We enjoy listening to this everyday. Don't know what else to say it's a CD and the music is enjoyable. Price was right too.
4,Turning Toward the Morning,"Please send me this cd. I am trying to find it, and I thought you might be able to sell it to me. Tell me how to order it. I love this cd."
5,great book,There just aren't that many books that let a father convey these kind of feelings for his daughter. Great book.
4,"Definitely a ""must buy""!","After reading these reviews, I will definitely buy this book.First of all, because it sounds like the illustrations are outstanding, but...mostly because my DIL, who is a BIG Elvis fan, has named our sweet little granddaughter, who will be one on July of 2010, Presley! Guess who this little girl is named for? The King, of course. This sounds like a perfect book for us to read to Presley, so I will have to order it and see if it is as good as it sounds. Also, our son, Presley's Dad, who is in the USMC, is currently serving in Afghanistan. So what better book to read to our little Presley than a book that shows a Dad reading to his daughter, in our case, the Dad is not with his daughter, but is thinking of her all the time. I look forward to seeing this book!"
5,Art Imitating Ritual Sebuku,"This book will always haunt me because it was thrown back in my face by someone who is now a stranger and was once a good friend and for no known reason. Poetic, no? Quite possibly not. Such is It. But having said all that, the poems are good, made of wood and good to chew on for a winter's night. People are shadows moving through the prisms of our changing eyes - poems are not. Poems do not change - we do."
1,CRAP CRAP CRAPPPPPP,"ok, first off let me just say that i have the model without the answering machine.ok about the feaking phone, its pure crap look else where. your better off burning your money then wasting it on this damn phone. i bought it cause it was cheap and 2.4ghz, boy what a waste. the reception on it is horrible, words cant describe the rage that runs through me when i have to constantly repeat my self and move about my room to talk to someone. the range also is horrible, the batteries dont last long at all. sad sad sad, i regret buying it and i dont recommend it one bit.your better off spending more money on a better phone as it will payoff.ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh vtech will be getting a letter from me personally about it aswell."
5,Great Product,"I have been using this product for probably 30 years!My dermatologist recommended it because it works well but doesnot cause zits. And no one believes my age (over 60) because my skin is smoothand spotless.Lately, I've had trouble finding it in stores. I hope theyare not going to discontinue it! It is perfect for a fair-skinned person.It works well under make-up, too. I just bought four bottles for fear theymight discontinue it. Hope not!"
5,"either its a placebo effect, or IT ACTUALLY WORKS!","i dont know if its just my mind playing with me or if this stuff is actually working, but my mood is definitely better now than it was earlier today. i took a pill at 430-ish and just made a tea with one of the tablets just now...but i feel pretty damn good. hopefully itll keep working everytime i take it and last 6 hours ish. is this what being an addict will feel like? (so sad...""im addicted to an herbal pill"")oh well, so far so good, so it gets 5 stars from me me for now."
5,good product,"I've had two potentially serious , water leak incidents since aquiring this product .Both were stopped early and fixed thanks tothese alarms . It's cheap and effectiveinsurance . Make a note to change thebatts once a year ."
1,Works OK but has a repeating beep every 2-6 hours,"I had to box all these up and send them back. I found that they produced a single beep on the average of every 4 - 6 hours which became very irritating especially in the kitchen since they were all concentrated in this area which is also near the laundry. I even put them on a sheet of plastic and wax paper as well, thinking that maybe the concrete, wood or tile they were resting on was conducting enough electricity to cause them to do this. It wasn't. Maybe mine is a bad batch or maybe the single small beep 4 times a day or more from each one may not bother anyone else. Not trying to tell you to steer away, just be sensitive on this so you can return them before the window closes if it is an issue with yours as well.I am going to buy a different brand. I'll pay more but sorry Smart Home, I can't live with this irritating beep."
4,Nice bundle,I've always wanted to pick up some of these but they can be expensive by the time you buy one for all of the areas that need one. The sensors that I've looked at all seem the roughly the same and there is not much to them. This unit works well based on a test I did and the alarm would definitely be heard on other floors. I still need a few more sensors and will probably buy another one of these 5 packs.
5,"Uplifting, informative and heartwarming!","Good storytelling, with rich historical background, as well as a much needed optimism and faith in one's fellow human beings that is hard to come by in today's difficult times."
5,Worth Recommending,"I don't normally take time to write reviews, but I have this book to be particularly well-written, helpful, and enjoyable to read. I would recommend it to any beginning or intermediate aquarium hobbyist."
2,This book is definitely not for beginners,"I do not doubt that the author possesses incredible knowledge on the subject of freshwater aquariums. But he is seriously lacking in the skills required to convey that information to beginners.Trying to wade through the way he felt information should be organized was exhausting. He'll go on and on and on about a certain subject only to say ""but beginners shouldn't try this"", or ""but hey, you're not a chemist so just do X"".Trying to find the answers to the simplest questions was next to impossible."
4,Very Helpful,"The book is really helpful, and yes the author did write the book to sound like he knows it all (and yet not all as you will find out)and the reader is a child who does not know anything. He just doesn't want you to fail at the hobby, so he wants you to pay very close attention and heed his advice. After all he does have a few decades of experience in keeping fish. Its a very informative book on almost everything you need to know about keeping freshwater fish. Of course you will still need to do more research after you buy the book, but its a good start. Also research fishless cycling if you don't want your fish to die."
2,"Some useful information, but incomplete for the beginner","As a book for beginners, this gives some good information about such things as the nitrogen cycle, and it gives some sample stocking schemes (which were the two reasons I bought this book), but it is lacking in other things such as fishless cycling, and how to acclimate fish--which is very important for the beginner. Further, the index is nearly useless.If you buy this book as a beginning aquarist, you will still need to supplement it with other resources before you make your first purchase of fish."
4,"Great ""Simple"" Guide","I am new to the hobby of aquaria and I wanted a guide that would give me just enough information to get started without a lot of extraneous details or esoteric information. I feel like this guide has given me the knowledge I need to get my first tank up and running. On the downside, the text repeated itself ad nauseum, major points repeated over and over. I do understand hammering home important information, but the way this guide is written is to essentially say the same thing, three times, in successive paragraphs. This fact makes trudging through the text tedious at times. Another issue I had with the guide is that the photographs scattered throughout the book do not really coincide with any description in the text. I was frequently wondering more about the fish or piece of equipment in the photo.Overall, I am glad I bought this and would recommend it for a beginner."
5,usefull info,nice reference to look back on if you own an aquarium and want to keep it well maintained and keep your fish healthy.
3,Could have been great.,"We own 3 or 4 of these ""There Goes a..."" videos for our 2 year old. He enjoys them, but... Why does this series waste so much video on potty humor? At one point in this video the co-star is filmed, for what seems like over a minute, standing and waiting for her partner to get done going to the bathroom. Hey! I've got a 2-year-old that needs stimulation, not wasted time. This same joke is repeated two more times in this video (same with There Goes a Spaceship). The producers of the video got access to some extremely cool places such as the Coast Guard Station at San Diego and Camp Pendleton but they waste time on cheap laughs."
4,A viewer from Chicago,"My son just loves Dave and Becky.. And this is a very good, action, keep it moving video. I even enjoyed it too.. We watch this one a few times a week.."
4,nice movie,"This movie is fun and my son really likes it. He watches it over and over, it is very informative."
4,This is for kids--adults beware!,"Our 2 1/2 year old has watched this many times and loves it...but Dad has to find something else to do now when its on. I wish that it didn't have the stupid ""inserts"" which try and give it a story or narrative quality. Helicopters, that's what we want! There are a good variety of Helicopters on the video, which makes it worth owning. There are Coast-Guard, Marine & LA Police Department helicopters. My son does seem to have learned a lot. He has a toy helicopter and he uses the string and hook on it to rescue people, like on the video. But the ""explanations"" on the video are simplistic in the extreme. They probably tried to accomplish too many things on this one video. My son would give it 4 stars at least, so that's what I give it."
1,snoooooooooze,"even within the diluted and bastardized genre of eastern/electronica fusion, this is an exceptionally uninspired collection.the first 2 discs are entirely a waste of time. the producers of these tracks think it is enough to loop some arabic melodies and apply some half assed trip hop beats, often with generic synth washes. poorly aranged and repetitive instead of hypnotic, this crap keeps your finger firmly on the FF button.the only redeeming moments are on disc 3, which is a somewhat pleasant, if uninteresting, listen.note: I'm no purist nor snob. I do enjoy some music in this ""fusion"" vein. for instance the Arabica collection is of better quality than this. but you would do much better just getting Arabic pop, as in Egyptian top-40, or Rai from Algeria or Morroco, because that is rich music full of personality and nuance, often influenced by hiphop, dancehall, or house, so it is also accessable and club friendly."
3,Arab Music,Too much like elevator music.Not allowed to sample CD either.I will not buy any CDs that I cant sample anymore too.
4,"A good, although sometimes boring look at the Vietnam War","This book has a lot of good information in it. Through the essays you gain a deep understanding of some of the events that influenced the course of the war that other books cover only slightly or omit all together.There are a couple HORRIBLE essays that seem to drag for a long long time. Each chapter concludes with 2 essays that either have differing points of view or cover different aspects of the chapter in more detail.The blessing of this book is that it has a lot of information that comes directly from the Vietnamese, including some translations of South Vietnamese army members as they consider their defeat and flee Saigon after the North takes it over.Over all, I like this book. At least one of the essays in the very beginning is bad enough that I almost put the book down and didn't pick it back up, but once you get past that, you are in for a good read!"
1,Overrated!,"I was required to read this book as part of a class, and unless you enjoy reading the same information repeated over and over you will not enjoy this book.Some of the sources are decent reads, but the majority of the book's essays are long and dry.If you're looking for a book on Vietnam I'd recommend you look some where else. Vietnam An American Ordeal by George Moss wasn't a bad read"
3,Well...,"Well, it's not Artemis Fowl, or even the Wish List... but its not a bad book either. I guess my hopes were just too high when I bought this book, and I expected it to be like the others. The plot is good, and I loved the ending, but the beginning is slightly drawn out, boring, and predictable. But I have to say, if you're under 14, you'll probably enjoy the book.The story of Cosmo Hill, a 'parently-challenged' boy, and his life as it changes from orphanage to Supernaturalist - fighting the parasites sucking the life from people in pain - is well illustrated by Colfer, and Cosmo's thoughts are easy to relate to for young adolescents.All in all, don't buy this book with any expectations, and you won't be dissapointed!"
3,"A decent read, but not a real page turner.","I had picked this up because I liked the Artemis Fowl series. With Artemis Fowl, Eoin Colfer had done an excellent job of creating exciting and interesting characters and throwing them into a fun, fast-paced, and original story.The Supernaturalist fell short of the Artemis Fowl series (I have no read The Wish List yet) in that the pace was slower and the characters were more dull and lacked substance. Hands down, the best thing about this book was the climatic ending. But it didn't leave me wishing for more.If you liked Artemis Fowl, you won't necessarily like this book. Recommended? Well, it isn't a terrible read. If you are a bookworm like me and would like something quick to read, then pick this up. Otherwise, there are better books worth your time."
3,Supernatualist,I think the Supernaturalist is a great book but you don't get the weapons and gadgets. Like when they use gumballs and wrap people but at the beginning where they live and their home is weird. You don't really understand most of it but you can understand the main story.
5,"nice, the best Eoin Colfer book yet","This a majorly overlooked book by Eoin Colfer, yet better than his widely acclaimed Artemis Fowl series. Sigh, this world is unfair. The Supernaturalist takes place in a world of pollution and nastiness, it hints towards how our world is slowly dying from our ruthless taking of our natural resources. It is in a place called Sattelite City, and it sort of explodes from there is a mix of awesome gadgets, suspense, rich story-line, and modern language. A great book for kids 10 and up. Absolutely SICK."
3,Just good,"Just didn't love it. It was good. I don't think I really connected to the premise. Also, I think it just seemed too out there, which I know doesn't make a lot of sense since I loved Artemis Foul, and evil boy genius taking on ferries isn't exactly mainstream either. But this one just didn't have that really great feeling to it. K, now that I've babbled my review sufficiently well, I shall retreat back to my cozy chair to read another book."
5,Super science fiction story,"I was given this book because I really enjoyed Colfer's previous books. This novel tells the story of Cosmo Hill (an odd name...) who manages to escape from a horrible orphanage. He joins up with a group of people who call themselves 'Supernaturalists'(hence the title of the book.) They meet all sorts of interesting characters in unusual situations, but then this is Eoin Colfer and you come to expect that sort of thing in his book.I enjoyed this book every bit as much as I did the Artemis Fowl series. Colfer is very talented and offers a different sort of story to what you usually expect in science fiction. Go for it!!!"
5,A fun read,"I have read Colfer's first Artemis Fowl and found it quite a fun read. The Supernaturalist was reasonably priced on Kindle so I decided to pick it up.Both the story (some nice twists and turns) and the characters appealed to me. I found Colfer's world building to be excellent, too. His light, witty style reminds me a lot of Rick Riordan, whose series I also enjoy.This book isn't going to provide you with much food for thought, but it will pass a few pleasant hours."
4,Great World with Dues Ex Machina,"I love the world that Eoin Colfer has created for this novel. The corporate takeover of so many aspects of the world speaks to a lot of the increasing amount of power which companies wield. I would almost classify this as a dystopian book although it's much more a world gone a little too far rather than a complete police state so I wouldn't put it in that category.Cosmo Hill gets really lucky all throughout this book to the point of deus ex machina. I don't mind a character getting lucky a couple of times because special circumstances are better story fodder, but pulling out another hidden talent every time he got into a tight situation does not a good story make.The ending was also a somewhat predictable. Thus, despite very much admiring the world that Colfer had created, I am a little disappointed in the overall story."
5,I liked the book,"I had written a big long recommendation for people to read this book and what it was about it, but my computer messed up and I lost it so just take my word that it is really good and read the rest of the positive reviews and they'll tell you what I wanted to say. READ THE SUPERNATURALIST!!!:)"
3,A Teen's Point of View,"Though not as good as the rest of Colfer's books, this is certainly worth the read and there are some interesting ideas in it. It is more serious than the Artemis Fowl books on the whole, but it is quite funny at times."
1,Colfer has really hit his low point,"Oh man, this is LAME!Weak charachters, poorly told story involving the destruction (oh wait, now we're trying to save them) of some cool-hued willo-the-wisps reminiscent of the Blue Meanies from The Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"".I've read all the Artemis Fowl books, so I've gotten used to Eoin Colfer's confident (slightly pompous) writing style, but I certainly wasn't prepared for this atrocity."
5,Loved AF and I loved this ;),"I think this book was magnificent. It was filled with suspense and twists. From reading this book I learned to never jump to conclusions. For example the parasites turn out to take only pain away instead of life force. This book was almost impossible to put down, after each page I turned the story kept getting better and better. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense, science fiction, or people with vast imaginations."
5,Please spend your money on this!,"Okay, maybe it is just me, but I love Eoin Colfer. Artemis Fowl was cool, The Wish List was good too, but The Supernaturalist was GREAT!Cosmo Hill is a great main character and its just keeps getrting better after the first chapter. Believe me, this is not a waste of time.If Eoin Colfer keeps on writing, heck he could be the greatest author in American history. Artemis Fowl, GREAT, GREAT novel. Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident GREAT GREAT novel. Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code The best one yet, The Wish List, maybe if you are not a Catholic you won't like the whole religious thing, but hey I'm Hindu and I like it and The Supernaturalist is a great book too!Sequels would be awesome to this book, even though it sets up to one, but hey I'm glad it did. Its climax is not poor and it has great exposition about Satelite City, and everything is just great!Please buy this book, listen to me from a TRUE Eoin Colfer fan, get this book it is not a waste of time."
3,The supernaturlsts,"I have never read an Artemis Foul book before but once I read the Supernaturlists I figured that he wrote pretty good books after all. The Supernaturlists is about a 14-year-old boy named Cosmo Hill. He is a runaway no sponsor. Him and his buddy Zig-zag ran and they were giver a 30 sec. head start because they have micro tiny trackers on them. But what they weren't expecting was he to catch up so fast. They were shocked and they fell to the ground. Zig-zag died and he was left there to die but the Supernaturlists found him. There was a little blue animal on his chest and he thought that it was sucking the life out of him and the supernaturlists killed it and he became one of them. But what they didn't know was that they were helping you, but if you want to know any more read the book."
3,Another Wish List,"Eon Colfer's Artemis Fowl Series have been brilliant. The Supernaturalists and The Wish List have been a little off base, but still good books."
4,Whoa...,"Ok, I had never read any of this genre before I read the Supernaturalist. I actually only picked it up becuase of the shiny cover, but once I started reading, I was hooked! I couldn't put it down until the very last page! I haven't read any other books by Eoin Colfer, so I don't know if this is what his books are usually like or not, but if they are...wow! This book keeps throwing new twists, so even when you think you know what's going to happen, you're usually wrong! If you're considering reading this book, you should definitely try it!"
1,Not convincing and the Physics suck badly,"This pretends to be SF. But it is really fantasy. The author describes a highly technical society that does not respect the individual. However Colfer either does have no clue about physics and technology, or he does not care. This is perfectly acceptable in fantasy, but not in something that pretends to be realistic. It does screw up the readers sense of how physical reality works. It also happens so often that it really breaks the mood frequently.Add to that that the story is not very interesting, the characters are flat and the plot is chaotic. I think reading this book is a waste of time at best."
1,"All right, but definately not as good as the Artimis Fowl Series","I agree with the reviewers who rated it poorly. At first, the story seemed to be very good, then it failed. I wouldn't recommend buying the book, but if you are really bored, get it from the library.I wish Eoin Colfer had developed more on the orphanage part, but he only featured it for one chapter basicly. The story's all about the supernaturalists blasting little blue ""aliens"", then it turns out the aliens are good. There was some action, but it wasnt very exciting. Boring."
5,I HAVE NEVER PICKED UP A BETTER BOOK IN MY LIFE,The Supernaturalist is a great sci fi book for anyone who likes sci fi. Eion Colfer did a great job writing this book. He described the characters well and made this book fun.
4,Excellent and fascinating book!,"This book and its author created a fascinating world and reality in which to follow believable characters through the fantastic. Much the way more traditional sci-fi and space opera has done over the years and continues to do: ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""2001"", ""2010"", ""Childhood's End"", ""I,Robot"", ""Ringworld"", ""Advent of the Corps"", and more."
3,Mrs. Claus and the beginning traditions of Santa,Interesting. Partially believable. Detailed and slow reading. Reading book to prepared to play the role of Mrs. Claus. It's helpful for that purpose.
4,A Delightful Take on Christmas Traditions,"My daughter gave me this book a few months ago, and I have really enjoyed reading How Mrs. Claus Saved Christmas. I had not read the previous book about Santa Claus, but I will very soon. This book not only offers an intriguing story, but ties in historical facts and characters at the same time giving the reader a sense that it really did happen the way Mrs. Clause tells the story.The characters seem true to life and the story follows a timeline as Mrs. Claus tells her listeners how she met her future husband and how they joined forces to provide gifts to needy children. This book may even inspire people to share what they have with those who are in need. At the same time, it can give you a smile with stories Mrs. Claus shares. Although this book is more relevant to read around the Christmas holiday, it can be enjoyed any time of year.How Mrs. Claus Saved Christmas"
5,The Movie!,"The movie itself is a surf video, not an actual movie... don't bother with it unless you are really interested in surfing, just stick to the soundtrack! :)"
2,A page flipper,"I bought Hubcap King and 'The Time of New Weather' together. I'll probably not be attempting The Time of New Weather for quite a while -- too much else on my reading list. I wanted so much to enjoy the novel (having mystical interests myself). The story does have some interesting metaphors and characters, but it took me a long time to get through it without flipping over countless slow sections, not because it was a heavy read -- quite the opposite, it just didn't hook me in any way. As much as Sean may be a wonderful teacher of Zen, I heartily suggest he take a few writing courses to learn how to become a better story teller -- to create a more coherent and escalating plot structure, develop multidimensional characters, scintillating dialog... I found myself neither amused nor excited nor gaining anything from the read. I felt instead that there was a lot of rambling and redundancy and fluff."
4,I enjoyed this book,"I've recommended this book to a few friends, but only certain ones. If you like books that are a little off the wall then give it a shot.I picked the book up to keep me company on an airplane and it did its job wonderfully. Have I grown as a human because of it? No, I don't think so. Was it a good read? Yeah, definitely."
4,Quirky & weird....A fun little book,"Though not a new concept in what this novel is trying to convey, it manages to make you think, is clever and has terrific humor. Bibi's quest is the quest we all go on, his is just more convoluted and possibly a little scarier than the rest of us. It's presentation is creative and each character is different and fun to discover as you read on. You have to suspend some disbelief and let the book just take you.Sean Murphy has managed to weave his Zen Buddhist philosophy into a quirky odd little novel with a lovable and admirable hero who quotes things like "" Life is a naugahyde seat cover with no stuffing!!"" If you like silly, weird but with an undercurrent of real issues we all deal with, this is a fun book.In retort to Leather who hated this novel-Malachy McCourt is Frank McCourt's brother-who wrote the pulitzer prize winning memoir Angela's Ashes. Malachy is an Irish name and if you haven't read Angela's Ashes-it's great!"
1,Waste of Money. Waste of Time,"""[A] rich, vast, and slyly comedic novel that leaves you laughing and weeping...Read and rejoice.""The above quote by ""Malachy McCourt"" (whoever the heck that is), printed on the front cover of the book, is an absolute lie. Any eight year old could write a better book than this. There were about 20 different times that I was about to just throw this stupid book away, but I pressed on and read just to see if old Malachy (what a name) was right. He wasn't. Please don't waste your time with it. If I can spare just one person the burden of this stupid book, I'll feel a little better. If you're looking for a good soul searching book, read ""Ishmael"" by Daniel Quinn."
5,Excellent,"If you like animals or adventure this is the book to get everything rolled into one. Great for children and adults, I have read it 20 times and it gets better every time."
4,"Good, But too fast.","Shadowmancer gets you going from the first page, it just goes straight into all action, fun and games and high pranks. Throw in a bit of magic and some strange monsters and you get an interesting read. The problem with it is very simple, you take a very promising situation, expect it to develop into a dozen pages of nerve tangling plot, with a twist or two along the way, and it does not do it, it is over in half a page and you are left thinking, I could have done that better. I however did not, and credit to Mr Taylor for doing what I have failed in twenty years of promising to do, but it could have given so much more to the reader. Definitely more Tolkein than Potter, but a long way from Lord of the Rings. It is enjoyable, and worth having a look at."
1,What A Huge Waste!,"If you like books that are moralizing to the point of insulting then you might want to throw away your money on this one. Otherwise, stick to good fiction like Eragon."
1,"unfinishable, unforgiveable","Like many reviewers, I almost always finish the books I read, no matter how dislikeable. But the poor plotting, absence of ANY characterization, humorlessness and just generally dismal writing was sapping my will to live. I agree with the reviewers who noted that its 'youth fiction' designation was not an excuse for its terrible quality: young people deserve good writing too!"
1,Don't bother,"This is possibly the worst book I've read in years. The characters have no depth at all. The book is written in such a jumpy, mismatched way that even the action does not flow smoothly. There is plenty of action, I'll allow that, but with such shallow characters, who cares?I'm a mother that likes to read young adult sci/fi fantasy to keep up with what my 13 year old daughter is reading. I didn't expect this book to be at an adult level. I did expect it to be similar to Harry Potter, which is the book that Shadowmancer was compared to in the book description. However, it is boring to read, and not at all like HP. My recommendation is to skip this book!"
1,This is no Harry Potter...,"I picked this book up after reading about its popularity in Britain, and it had been compared to the Harry Potter series. Unfortunately, i was quite disappointed. The plot was incredibly weak, and it took all the strength I had to merely finish the book! Perhaps some younger readers will enjoy it, but there are other better written books out there that they should spend time reading."
2,It's a bit lacking,"""Shadowmancer"" is a good idea. It's got promise, it has magic (and anti-magic... well, god-power... whatever), it has good and evil, but... it's. Extremely. Boring. An answer to Harry Potter? Well... yes, if you mean that it's the opposite of Harry Potter. Rowling's book is intresting and intriguing. Taylor's book is boring and wordy. While ""Shadowmancer"" has a ton of good ideas, it doesn't execute them very well at all. It's charcters are too obviously written for their age, and it's evil guy is too predictable. The best character is Raphah, but even he is a little too ""good magic"" based, and is not the type of character that has a sense of humor. That's what this book needs (besides better characters, a less confusing setting, and logical bad guys): a sense of humor."
1,Couldn't even finish it.,I couldn't even finish the book. I got about half way through and realized I wasn't paying attention and didn't care. Nothing like Harry Potter - not fun at all. I can't recommend this at all!
1,Don't waste your time,"I just finished *Shadowmancer* and I am very disappointed. I cannot recommend this book at all. I never warmed to any of the characters. The plot is uninteresting. The conclusion is anti-climactic.But worst of all, the book is preachy. The author is an Anglican vicar and he insists on bringing the Christian ""mythology"" right into the story, only changing the names to protect the innocent. I do not object to the invocation of Christian themes--I love Lewis, Tolkien, and Charles Williams--but I object when the story is simply a pretense to convert the reader.I love fantasy, but I cannot recommend this book at all. Very disappoiting."
1,Worst book I ever read!!!,"I agree with all the people who gave this book 1 star and I also would have given it a ""0"" if I could. I am a librarian and I love to read fantasy and certainly, not all I've read has been good but this book will easily go to the bottom of the barrel. I have never written a review for Amazon... this book was so bad that I felt the need."
1,"A Game First Try, But Harry Potter It Ain't!","From what I read of it...actually I didn't finish it due to lack of interest. I read the press kit for the book and was hooked by what appeared to be an engrossing storyline and the background of the author himself. Sadly, the book failed to deliver as promised. Try it if you like darker, gothic, evil attempts to take over the world type of books, but I don't know how the press thought this would be the ""next Harry Potter"". J.K. Rowling is in no danger of losing her laurels."
1,Shadowmancer disappointment,"As a youth fiction author I try to read books in the genre I am writing. I eagerly picked up Shadowmancer after hearing it was outselling Harry Potter. What a disppointment! The writing was not professional, stilted and dis-jointed. The characters continually changed personalities, the story choppy and had very bumpy chapter transitions. Most of the story was told in passive voice and point of view changed per sentence. It was incredibly dark considering it was supposed to be ""Christian."" The few Bible verses thrown in were not labeled as such and if you are not familiar with them, you would not have known you were reading Scripture. The ending was totally unsatisfying and left you wondering what happened. Don't waste your money on this book. If you want a well-written, exciting book with both good and bad characters and is a breath of fresh air, buy Eragon."
3,"Not great, but not bad either","I think I would have liked this book better if it hadn't been touted as ""the next Harry Potter."" It has a lot of similarities of story to the Potter books, but the next great thing in young adult fantasy, it isn't. Because of the hype though, I was disappointed. Aside from that, it was a nice little story. I think it would best be enjoyed by someone who has not read many books of this genre as a sort of introduction to the genre. The story tended to be trite - everything worked out just the way it needed to with little effort on anyone's part. The kids in the book were likable, the story was enjoyable and lighthearted, I'll probably read the next book, but I will check it out from the library rather than buy it."
3,"Great material, Love the spiritual insight, hated the ending","Athough not a real fiction reader, I decided on reading Shadowmancer becuase of the hype that it was recieveing in Christian circles. Being a Christian that I am, I was very excited about a book that combined a spiritual otherwordly subject matter with an adventure story set in a very exotic and fascinating world of 1800 England. I was intrigued early in my reading and was very excited about the book but as i read, i felt that I was stumbling along a path of half finished character development and an ever more predictable plot. I still applaud the author for blatently exploring the spiritual side of the unseen in this book, I just wish he would have developed deeper characters and a more developed ending otherwise this would have been a 4 to 5 star subject for me!"
2,"Ugh, another boring book","Yeah, boring book. Most reviewers have already said all that needs to be said. This is unoriginal in every way, meaning in essence, the characters are boring and typical and predictable, the ending was a ""no duh good was going to win"" and therefore predicatble, there were no good lessons that I can remember learning from the book. . . do I need to go on? Its just boring. . .If you want a great Christian series then Legends of the Guardian King, Chronicles of Narnia, and Binding of the Blade are probably the best you can get, though I haven't read much christain stuff. If you want non-christian books that are amazing then got Sword of Truth, Tales from Earthsea, Song of ice and Fire, Legend of Drizzt, the Bartimaeus Trilogy, or Artemis Fowl. All mentioned are better in ever way imaginable than this book and are of many different styles."
3,I found it interesting!,"I do not agree with the previous comments. I myself enjoyed the book. While I would not in any way compare this book to Harry Potter, it is still a good read, and I found it hard to put the book down in parts."
5,Get the Chills on a Hot Summer Day!,"I love this book, it is scary, fun, fast, and really takes you into another world. This book is so creepy, I would recommend that you read it by the fireplace in the winter so you don't turn into an ice sculpture. I had to check the doors and windows twice each time I started reading this book . . . Wonderful fun especially for kids or adults who like fantasy books, comic books, and video games."
1,Not a JK Rowling,"I bought this book with the expectation that it would be as entertaining as the Harry Potter series but it doesn't come close. I can't see why the Newsweek reviews were so good because it's prose was difficult to read. The novel was written in old English using uncommon diction. I have never written a book review in my life but my disappointment with this book has compelled me to do so. If you live within the UK, you may enjoy this book. But if you live outside the UK, it will be a disappointment for you. If you want Harry Potter entertainment, this is not the book for you. GP Taylor is no JK Rowling."
1,Disappointment,"I had heard that this was supposed to be a Christian alternative to Harry Potter and that it had gone global because it was so good. I must have been reading the wrong newspapers. Sorry, this one doesn't work for me.If you want to read a good Christian fantasy, try Forrest Tales: The Secret of the Labyrinth. No witchcraft or occult. They get their supernatural powers from the brains we are born with. G.P.Taylor must have forgotten how to use his."
1,Just Plain Unprofessional,"While I was reading this book, I couldn't help thinking of all of the good writers out there who have had no luck getting published. Even if you narrow it down to Christian fantasy writers, I'm betting that there are a bunch that have written something better than this. Welcome to the mysterious world of book-buying.While Shadowmancer is not without potential, the utterly unprofessional writing spoiled any enjoyment I might have had. It's a mystery to me why this book took off the way it did. I have to say I'm thoroughly disappointed."
1,Save your Money,"Wow, did I buy into the hype. I read over a book a week and this has to be the worst book I have read in a long time. The writing is redundant and scattered. Get ready to see the same words and expressions over and over, ie ""tufts"" of grass and like a ""mustard seed."" This was like a bad cross of the Dark Materials series and a Clive Barker fantasy - except both of which are light years in head of this slop.My question is, what 8 by 10 glossy photos does this guy have as blackmail to get the press this book got? Harry Potter? Are you kidding me? This was horrible. Every book in this genre I've read was better than this, ie Harry Potter, Samarkand - Barteumus, Artimus Fowl, The City of Ember, Dark Materials, Inkheart, Eragon ....(...)"
1,Terrible - I threw it away,"On a trip overseas and in need of something to read, I picked up Shadowmancer on a whim. What a mistake. After forcing myself to read to the end I threw it away in a hotel room deliberately.This is almost certainly the worst book I have ever read. There were a few well-written paragraphs here and there (the first chapter had me hoping), but on the whole this is shockingly bad.Characters are bland and make incomprehensible decisions. A crude, unhelpful brand of Christian-like religion is bandied about in a silly sort of way. The pacing is disastrous; things randomly happen, then stop, then start again. Creatures and ideas pop up for no apparent reason and then are abandoned, never to reappear.The worst thing is that there is press fawning over it like it's the second coming of Harry Potter. That series might be weak as literature, but it's an order of magnitude more worthwhile and entertaining than this drivel."
2,Shadowmancer: Such a good title deserved a meatier story,"The plot was okay, the characters piqued interest, and the setting was descriptive. So... why did I give it only two stars??? Lack of development!!!!! With all of the elements of a good story, I never lost interest, but I also never got hooked. I kept thinking he was going to flesh out his characters - up until the last few scenes. I was very unhappy to have spent that much time and learned that little. It seems like our Vicar turned author had a great idea, came up with some good characters and then did not spend enough time writing. Kinda like reading someone's term paper that they had all semester to work on, but only wrote the night before.I do not recommend this book - especially to younger folks. The bad guys have a much meaner caste to them and the humor is lacking. Stick with Harry!"
2,"Good for Summer, but not much longer.","I am a supervisor in a bookstore and was aware of all of the hype leading up to the U.S. release of Shadowmancer. I look upon each release of the ""Next Harry Potter!"" with much trepidation. It seems that whenever that cry is yelled loud enough, publishers push and shove with their wallets, advertise to great lengths to see the book sell well for a month or so, and then dissappear. I forsee Shadowmancer following this trend. While there is plenty of action, there is little else to write about. It makes for a good summer read to hold the attention of a tween or teen, but the book's characters will not grip the heart like J.K. Rowling or Cornelia Funke's characters have the ability to do."
2,A Christian Harry Potter It Isn't,"While good versus evil is very well defined in this book, the plot is sorely lacking in progression and development. Taylor is hard-to-follow as he attempts to weave a web of diabolical intrigue and Divine omnipotence. The author jumps from one character to another, leaving the reader to question exactly who is doing what to whom.I give this book two stars for the good intentions. I had hoped it was on the same literary level as Harry Potter with the addition of a clearly defined Christian theme. The Christian theme is here, but the literary workmanship of a Rowling or a Tolkien is painfully absent. Obviously, I was disappointed."
1,I want a full refund!!!!!!!!!,What is this crap?? This book is so bad it has taken my 7 months to read just half. Normally I read books twice the size in a few days. Something is seriously wrong. [...]
5,Shadowmancer!!!!!,Wow! What a brilliant read! Tons better than Harry Potter. I couldn't put it down. To my way of thinking G.P. Taylor is as good as Tolkien.More pleeze!
1,THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this book with high hopes but soon found it to be the most boring,lame,stupid book i could ever read. I would not even suggest this book to torture the most evil man ALIVE!!!!!!!!. I'm thinking of suing to get my 11.50 back plus 5,000,000,000$ for 10 hours out of my life that i will never get back. Books that I would suggest are Eragon [and soon Eldest book two] by Christopher Paolini.And all the Harry Potter books By J.K. Rowling."
1,Disaster!!!,"I felt compelled to write this review. I can't state this more clearly, don't buy this book! I read the reviews stated here by other readers and the only one that I can forgive is the one written by the 6th grader.This book is a mess! Characters are introduced haphazardly and then forgotten. The pace is confusing and the conflicts are resolved in an almost comical way.Save your money!!!"
1,Bleh,"Quite frankly, a terrible book. If you HAVE to read this book, wait a few months and borrow it from the library. The characters are flat and undeveloped. Their history is written out in their introduction instead of slowly being revealed. Their character development falls flat, even the plot itself falls flat. The book was waaaay too preachy, but I thought until I could deal with that until I came to the ending which was horrible. Quite frankly, the author should have stuck to his job instead of deciding to try something new.Like many before me, I wish I could give 0 stars but sadly Amazon doesn't allow that."
1,"A Christian Harry Potter? No, a silly Christian Oz book","If you want a silly fantasy in which the most powerful magician in the universe has one serious weakness -- vulnerability to burglary by a minor magician who has discovered a deadly secret -- then read ""The Lost Princess of Oz"". But please, don't try to pin something like that on God. A maverick molecule running around is the last thing we need."
2,Disjointed and dull,"This book failed to get and hold my attention. It's not the religious underpinings, it's the wildly inconsistent style. The action starts quickly but it's so poorly described to become both boring and confusing!"
5,Awesome fantasy novel with a Christian view,"What G.P. Taylor has written is a novel that my 13 year old son and I both agree is exciting, scary and thought provoking. The deeper your knowledge of religious history, Christianity and/or evil, the more believable this novel is. I like to read what both my youngest sons are reading so that I can put things in the proper perspective, and use the books as a teaching tool. From the reviews I've read, I plan to read all the rest of the books Taylor has written. P.S. We also liked Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, Eragon and Eldest."
4,C. S. Lewis meets J. K. Rowling,"Shadowmancer is a wonderful story, although it is a bit lean on character development and the Christian subtext is, at times, a little too preachy. But the story is rich and very well told, with a fast paced and exciting plot line. Fantasy lovers who enjoy The Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter will love this one. And at a mere 304 pages, seasoned Harry Potter fans will rip right through it. G. P. Taylor shows great potential as a writer and I look forward to the sequel."
5,Shadowmania sweeps the world!,"Shadowmancer is a simply wonderful book set in 18th Century Yorkshire, England. It is a tale of superstition, witchcraft and magic, featuring an evil vicar called Obadiah Demurral who wishes to take over the world! Whilst Shadowmancer is listed as a children's book, it also has an adult read quality about it. Often hailed as the new J. K. Rowling, G. P. Taylor is far better compared to Tolkien. The story unfolds at a breathtaking pace and holds the reader throughout. You may need to read it a couple of times before fully appreciating it and the film is sure to be a massive success! I recommend reading Shadowmancer in a dark room, probably just before you go to sleep to amplify the fear factor! Charge up the mobile in case you need to phone a friend!"
4,"Not Rowling; not Tolkien; Instead,...","The comparisons of G.P. Taylors' Shadowmancer to J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter are way off - the comparisons to Tolkien less so. G. P. Taylor is neither of these, but compares best with one of Tokien's friends and contemporaries, C.S. Lewis. Shadowmancer is full of allegory (which Tolkien detested, and C.S. Lewis laid on thick) and an unabashed Christian sensibility. The action is frequent and cliffhanging, but the spirituality of Raphah and his two new followers remain the center of gravity of the story.Reverend Taylor is not a stylist; the dialogue changes eras sometimes, in a way Tolkien, Eddison, or Patrick O'Brian never would do, but he manages to tell his story effectively. We've seen good versus evil before, we've seen dangerous magical talismans before, and we've seen the journey of outcasts before (Will and Lyra, anyone?) but Taylor brings enough to it to repay the reading. I recommend it."
3,"a good read, but overall an insult to sci-fi/fantasy","I love fantasy. I love sci-fi. I love well-written, mind-bending novles. I also love good, solid theology. This book delvers none of those goods- except for the last, which was what intrigued me. However, due to the rest of obvious Tolkien pulls- the rip off the palanirs is the worst, though not quite as bad as the rigging Tolkien receives in Eragon- and the frantic rush to push the story along, it is overall and insult to my all-time favorite genre.And Wormwood was even worse.Skip Shadowmancer unless you're 10-12 years old and have not yet read Tolkien."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I really wanted to like this book, but it was impossible. I met GP Taylor at a book signing and he seemed really nice. There were all these rabid Shadowmancer fans there going on about how this was the most amazing book ever and so I picked up a copy. Frankly, I was very disappointed. This book is very poorly written and it's distracting from the story. The religious aspects, which start out interesting, become preachy and downright boring. I have never just abandoned a book mid-read but I was very close with this book as I was about 50% in and I just plain old didn't care what happened to the characters. To compare this book to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings is like comparing my How I Spent my Summer Vacation essay from second grade to my Honors Thesis in college. It might have been a great book with some heavy editing, but as published, it is not worth reading."
2,Not so shadowy.....,"I am struggling to finish this book. I'm a school librarian who reads lots of different kinds of books, especially Fantasy titles. Maybe I've read too many lately...with two boys, one girl who have to save the world as we know it. I just don't see the spark in this one."
1,Offensively bad,"This was a truly badly written book. In addition to trite characterizations and borderline gender discrimination, the plot is dumb and the writing is terrible. Don't believe the hype and the cool cover. It's a rotten book."
2,big disappointment,"I'm giving this 2 stars because (for some reason) I was interested enough to skim all the way to the end. One or two of the characters caught my attention. But as other reviewers have said, the writing was clunky and failed at being ""poetic,"" the action was hard to follow, and the characters were undeveloped. The thing that bothered me the most was the bludgeoning Christian message. The whole point seemed to be ""God is good, the devil is bad."" That wasn't the background, or the framework, or the characters' motivation -- it was the entire plot.At least those who think there are too many ""anti-Christian"" books for young readers now have something to read, but the rest of us shouldn't bother."
1,Shadowmancer a shallow look at fantasy,"I was told at a conference that this was going to be a huge hit. So I ran out and read the book only to be disappointed. I'm sorry, but this book isn't worth the attention it is getting. It is a shallow attempt at writing fantasy. There is no real character development and there is so much potential that Taylor could have made a great novel and/or series out of this, but instead he left the world with a flat, boring book. Not one single character is developed enough to make the reader care.I wouldn't waste your money on this book."
3,Left in the shadows,"Shadowmancer has all the makings of a great fantasy novel but after the first chapter starts a downward spiral of an underdeveloped plot and sad to say too obvious ""in your face"" religion. Felt like the author had read and admired Tolkien's work but couldn't pull together the allegories and submerge them in Tolkien fashion. The book is of average interest & leaves a few things unresolved. Beats some things that are out there for kids to read ."
5,Rosemany Clooney,Rosemary Clooney was one of the most popular singers in the Fifties and can still sing better than many of the current so-called singers of today. A great talent!
1,Bad,I ordered this gift for my son for Christmas. Had the toy all put together less then an hour and it stopped working. Had a replacement sent out and that one didn't work from the start. Was not a happy parent.
1,Bummer for a 3 year old,"Hero City Ice mountain was the only toy my 3 year old wanted, We got it for him,put it together with no help from the instructions because they were very hard to understand.The darn thing would not work, wish I new about the secret reset button!I sent it back to Walmart.com. got credit because I thought I could buy another. Not. It is impossible to find one in stock or have to pay a fortune .Mattel was of no help. ..."
1,It doesn't work!,"My son asked Santa for this toy and he got it, but when we put it together it wouldn't work. We tried everything, even 2 different kinds of batteries, but it still didn't work. We returned it and searched 5 stores the day after Christmas to get really excited, bring home another one, and it didn't work either!! We are not happy! I had 3 different people try to get it to work and nothing. We are now convincing my 3 year old to pick out something else. My husband calls it junk...What a waste of time, not 1, but 2 non-working Ice Mountains."
2,didn't work,Purchased this toy for Christmas for our 4 year son who had been asking for it for months. After assembling the toy and putting the batteries in found that none of the electronics worked. Have spent the last three days looking for a replacement only to find that none are in stock anywhere. The toy does seem very sturdy and my son liked playing with it for the short time even without the electronics. Really wish the electronics would work because it seems like a cool toy.
1,Lots of fun for the entire 10 mintues it was working,"My son just got this toy last night for his birthday. After patiently waiting the assembley, he was really excited to play with it. The on/off switch for the crane stop working literally after 10 mintues! It's a shame. It's so irritating!"
1,No Good,"Recently purchased for my sons b/day,put it all together and the electronics did not work,Went and bought new batteries still no good returned it for another still no luck ,Called Mattel only told them i bought a toy for my son she quessed that it was Ice Mountain They are having LOts of Problems with this Toy!!!!!"
2,Matchbox Ice Mtn Collapses,"This is just a warning to anyone who plans on purchasing this gift for a 4 year old, don't. My son received this last year for Christmas and I think it is the only day it actually work. Besides the crane breaking many of the other pieces kept falling off, the cars would get stuck under one of the ramps."
3,Not Boy Proof,"My 4 year old received Ice Mountain as a Christmas gift. By the next day it was already running sluggishly on a new set of batteries. The gears that run the ""ice ring"" slipped and made a terrible grinding noise. The problems persisted even after a change of batteries. It totally stopped working, noises and all, about a month after Christmas. Although he continues to play with it and enjoy it, as a parent I was extremely dissapointed with the durability and longivity of the toy especailly for the price."
1,Bought two different ones with the same results!,"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't even make it to the new year before the crane broke and would not move anymore. He was devistated because this was the only toy he really wanted. So I bought a second Ice Mountain on line because all of the stores were sold out. With in a week, the same thing happened. The crane quit working! This toy is a great idea, but needs work!"
1,Very Unhappy,"My four year old wanted this toy so badly last year that we bought it for him. After the third Ice Mountian we finally got our money back. The lift would not properly lift the cars to the top of the Ice Mountian.When I called Mattel, their response was that I had not put it together correctly. As I had assembled three of them, I was quite aware how to assemble Ice Mountian. Mattel's constantly telling me that I had mis-assembled their product was extremely frustrating and insulting.The concept was cool but the design is flawed. I have found that items bearing the Hot Wheels name versus the Matchbox name work, are better constructed and more durable. I had the same issue with a car wash two years prior to the Ice Mountain purchase.My son, now five, still wishes he could have an Ice Mountain, however he knows they are ""junk"" as we call it at home.Beware before you buy this product."
2,Don't get fooled again!!!,"My son loves this toy, when it stays together, and that is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. This one is difficult to put together. I gave it 2 stars for educational as you have to put it together like a puzzle, often. If and when everything does come together-believe me-it WILL all fall apart. My guy is 5 and likes to play, not be careful. KEEP YOUR MONEYThe house is still in 3 pieces, never did stay together. Not even Duracell will power this thing. Took the batteries out and used them on a toy that worked.Buy it at next year's garage sales."
2,VERY NICE,"Trust me if your are looking for something fun to do with your cars this is it. It doesn't use a lot of electricity, the batteries will last about a half a year if played with about an our a day every couple of days. It works with many diffrent types of cars. It is worth buying!"
2,My Sons likes the toy but it broke after 5 days,"We bought our son the ice mountain for his third birthday. He really likes the toy but the crane mechanicism broke after 5 days of use. Also, if the track does not turn, make sure that it is pushed in all the way in the base. He stills plays with it even though it is broken, but I agree it is very disappointing to buy a toy and have it broken within the first few days.When I was a boy, I grew up with Matchbox and Hot Wheels. I loved them. I was hoping to start my son on them, but now I will have to reconsider."
2,Don't bother with this,"The picture makes it look much cooler than the toy really is. My son is an avid matchbox car collector and I thought he would enjoy this set, so we purchased it for him for Christmas.The assembly is long and after it's put together, it easily falls apart. I thought that the controls in the picture actually controlled the crane, but it doesn't. The lift portion on the left of the toy never worked. The car always gets jammed in it and it never makes it up there. The concept was awesome, but the quality of it is poor. Don't waste your time or room space with it.We paid $20 for it and it's still not worth the money. Our son played with it for about 2 days and now it sits in pieces in his room. I'm about to toss it."
2,Now I Get It - Not Worth Buying,"Now I get all the negative comments regarding this toy. At first a number of them seemed petty, but now I get it. Crane Noise - it's so loud that I'm unable to hear the tv, my husband talk, or another person on the phone over it. Crane Design - it sucks & has never worked right. Does my 2 yr old boy realize that it doesn't work? No, but it sure would be more fun for him if it did. Durability - terribly annoying given that 6 different things keep breaking off every 1-3 minutes & my 2 yr old can't fix them himself but is bugged by the sudden change in his toy. So what happens? I have to stop what I'm doing every 5 minutes to keep fixing the basic parts or convince him (not so well) to move on. Assembly - really sucks. My husband & I together sat for 2 hours and had great difficulty putting it together. Looking for a bettter purchase? Try the Fast Lane Garage - my son LOVES it and plays for 20 minutes at a time numerous times a day with it."
2,Not worth it...,"My 3 year old son wanted this toy for Christmas last year. After receiving it, he played with it for all of two days before it broke. I knew buying for a 3 year old was a risk but wanted to get this for him and hoped it was more durable. The ice part broke apart and got to where it wouldn't stay together at all without falling through on its own. The arm stopped lifting and needless to stay there was more than one disappointed person in our home that Christmas. I wouldn't buy it if I could get by with it."
1,POOR ELECTRONIC QULAITY,My 3 1/2 year old son received this for Christmas because this is what he wanted. He was very excited about and loved playing with it but the sound effects did not work at all. It took my husband a very long time to put it together and then to find out after all that time that the sounds don't work. After reading the other reviews about this I will not get another one. It is too much money to waste my time if another one doesn't work. I will replace it with a much better quality toy.
2,Dissapointed,"We gave our son this toy for Christmas. After assembling the toy on Christmas morning, my husband and I sat for an hour trying to get it to work. We did everything from re-assembling to installing new batteries and got nothing.I returned the toy to the store the next day to find out that many people had experienced the same problem, and that there was not another one available anywhere. My son really wanted this toy for Christmas, and was really dissapointed that we had to take it back.I have been very satisfied with the quality of the other matchbox playsets that we have purchased for my son. I hope that the problem with this toy does get resolved, because I'd still like to get him one. It does look neat, and I think that if it worked, he'd have many hours of fun with it."
4,It broke in one week,"My 4-year-old loved this toy, but the crane that raises the cars broke right away. We already disposed of the box and have no receipt for it, so I think we're stuck. My son tried to push the crane arm down when it was going up and the gear inside broke. Now it makes a terrible sound and the crane won't move. If your child has this toy, make sure they know not to touch the crane arm. And good luck. They can't help but grab it if it doesn't pick up a car right."
5,"Pleasant, enjoyable, meaningful, diverse",I lost my first copy and was so happy to be able to download it!
5,Blue Sea quality is #1,You can't ask for something that is as nice in a simple product. All the stainless is good quality. The plastic is strong and solid. Blue Seas is always good stuff.
3,Unit locked up. Latest model 11 OK,"I purchased this SFX-10 from another reputable vendor. Ir worked well for 9 months then one morning it simply locked up, some led's came on but no response to any commands, no pix. Called Sima support, no human available all day long (a Tuesday). We use this unit for our Church's DVD recording. It worked well when it worked but a unit that locks up is useless. I have sent it in using the Sima email form on 6/21/10. I'll keep you posted.BTW, I couldn't find an email tech support address for this unit. Suspicious. I do not recommend a buy, get a used Panasonic from ebay instead, I have one which I'll use until the Sima issue is resolved.Since the first post, I have received the unit back and it has run successfully for over a year. It was a failed power supply. The model 10 is no longer available but the model 11 has run at another facility for over a year and has no problems. It is a good value for the price."
4,"Good read, nice Christmas story","I like Christmas romances. There, I've said it. I love to curl up with a Christmas-themed romance next to the tree and read for hours.This book is another set in Misty Harbor. The protagonist is Amber, a woman who moved in with her aunt in the sleepy town after the death of her young husband. Along comes an old friend, and there's a Christmas romance.I got this book because I liked Christmas on Conrad Street so well. This story didn't disappoint me. It's simple, sweet, and enjoyable. If you like Christmas romances, you'll like this one too.The only negative about the book is the atrocious editing and proofreading. Really terrible! This book should have been cleaned up a great deal before hitting the presses. Nonetheless, it's a good read."
2,Price is High for quality,They sell the EXACT same thing for $19.99 at Brylane Home . com. It looks to me that they are very flimsy so I wouldn't put anything too heavy on them or they are going to spill in your lap!
4,Table mate II,"I was extremely happy with this product. It is just what I was wanting. I was surprised and disappointed, however, with the cost of shipping. I ordered the Table Mate along with several items direct from Amazon and couldn't find the cost of shipping as I checked out. The first time I was able to view the cost of shipping was when the completed order conformation came. It was just $3 less than the price of the product! They had shipped it expedited without being asked. I wrote and complained about this procedure and my unhappiness with the way they handled my order. They replied promptly and I was given a $5 refund on shipping. I guess my advice would be to make sure you find shipping before ordering."
2,Great art.....that's it!,"Wow! What amazing art. Everyone should flip through this if they get the chance. They shouldn't however read it. Mark Waid, who I really enjoy, writes a meaningless story in which he plays with the ideas of the afterlife in the DC Universe. However, everyone reading this knows there is nothing at stake if they can follow the complex and drivel filled plot. It seems like Waid just wanted to tell what certain heroes believe in, which doesn't have any effect on anything. Like I said, the art by Bryan Hitch is drop dead gorgeous especially on the oversized pages. So, a 5 for art and -1 for story averages out to a overall grade of 2. Sorry."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"An oversized hard to fit in the bookcase type of publication that is a one shot adventure. The Justice League face a conflict and use of power on at least a planetary scale, so must try to broker a deal and establish lines of communication with the beings they find themselves opposed to, to prevent some extremely serious consequences for a lot of lifeforms."
4,IT'S FOLD-Y!!!,"Mi mama likes this. And it's fun to fold and unfold. I feel like a ninja whenever I unfold it and the pieces snap together, and then I can quickly ""dismember"" it."
4,Folding Cane,A very very good product. Needed a cane for a while due to a joint replacement. This cane worked like a charm - absolutely wonderful. No complaints at all. Not 5 stars but I can't give you a good reason why I gave it only 4 stars.
2,Stink,This movie was down right horrible. No suspense whatsoever. It has absolutely no plot. I'm guessing the killer had something against the main character since he stuffed all the heads in his apartment. Did he have something against his dad? His dad was a cop. Did his dad arrest him once or something? Or were the details of his dad just thrown in there for no reason? Or is the killer just a homophobe? The ending of this movie is just insulting. It actually made me mad that I sat through it.I'll give it 2 stars for the nasty eyeball scene.
3,Slasher film from a different perspective,"After years of seeing slasher films with scantily clad young girls running around, it seems long overdue that we get a film focusing on half-dressed young gay men. Well, ""Hellbent"" is here to remedy that situation. A killer wearing a horned mask and weilding a lethal sword that he uses to cleanly chop the heads off his victims, is on the loose. His focus is four young men (one in drag) who are attending a Halloween party. Not nearly bad as I expected (the acting and production values are actually quite good) but nothing exceptional. The only unique perspective this films brings is the gay angle. If you enjoy a good slasher film that avoids a motive or a viable explanation and is filled with a few good scares and lots of blood (and half nude actors!), it is worth a look."
4,"Not too bad, especially for the genre","Hellbent is certainly not the best horror/slasher flick ever made, but it is entertaining none-the-less. In fact, I actually wrote about the film after it hit theaters for a graduate class at USC's School of Cinema-Television. There is an underlying commentary contained within the film regarding gender roles and expectations. I throughly enjoyed both of my viewings in the theater and I am very happy that I will be receiving it on DVD in a few weeks. Expect several shocks and one major gross-out/laugh-til-your-side hurts laugh near the end of the flick. Enjoy!"
2,"""Standard door thickness""??","Why does this product say it fits ""standard interior doors""? Why can't you have said it fits doors up to 1 and 3/8th inch thick doors only?! How am i supposed to know that my door (1 and 3/4 inch) isn't ""standard""?What am i supposed to do with this now? I can't return it for a refund without paying return shipping which is almost as much as the item cost. The incompetence to describe actual dimensions of your product have cost me money."
4,"Nice looking, well made and strong",I like this hanger because it fills the need it should fill. It hangs over the door and is strong enough for suits and dry cleaning. It is a space saver.
3,Gift,Purchased as a gift - recipient was reading the series and wanted other volumes to go with it . ..........
4,pretty good for a middle book,"I love Maggie Furey's work and this book doesn't fall into the usual ""middle book"" morass. The story is great, the characters are well-presented, and the writing is wonderful. Furey deserves a lot of credit for her work and this series shows it."
3,A Middle Book,"Book two falls into teh same hole that many second books do. It is a bridge, bad stuff happens a lot, everyone is unhappy, everything is confusing, and you, the reading, have not a clue what is going on because the ends are still hanging and its quite fuzzy.I did not dislike the book, but when I put it down I debated if I would get the third one because I felt lost. The book just started, and it just ended, in the middle of what was gonig on. I found no satasfaction, just more questions without answers.Do not think that it is not worth reading, but I advise that you have the third book on hand and just open and start reading it as soon as you finish the second."
3,This book was just okay for me,"I picked up this book thinking that it was a stand alone novel. I didn't realize that it was part of a series or I wouldn't have read it.Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the other books. Although I felt like this book pretty much explained everything that had happened in the other books (over and over and over).I am shocked that this book is the end of the series, seeing as I felt like this book ended without a real conclusion. I finished it wondering what would happen with the main characters instead of feeling like the story was finished."
5,Christian - Historic Fiction,Awesome series! I love Michael Phillips books about this time period in American history. The book has some outstanding and well developed characters. You feel as though you know them personally.The books in this series have a wonderful multicultural and biracial theme. The characters are morally and ethically attentive. I like this series for young secondary female students--very empowering.Do read the series in order. You will enjoy the sequencing of the events in the lives of these brave sisters who encounter tremendous odds during the American slavery system and post Civil war era.I have the entire series and several other books written by this author. Michael Phillips is a great author and he writes wonderful books. Michael Phillips write wonderful books and he is a great author.
5,christian books,Michael Phillips is a good author. It's nice to read a book where people care about each other and work together in tough times.
4,a galloping mix!,A great new sci-fi concept! Broadened my horizons once I sunk my teeth into it. You will not be disappointed!
3,Two-reeler story that should have been a three-reeler,"I enjoyed reading this relatively short (280 pages or so) novel set, mostly, in 1913 during the early days of moving-making in California. I would have liked a longer book better, though. After the climax, the book comes to a very sudden end, with a couple of the characters reminiscing about what happened after; this was a let-down.I got the feeling that Estleman had set a limit for himself, which would have been in keeping with the practices of the film-makers, who cut their stories to fit a certain size, such as two reels of film. And then, with a couple of pages left, it appears he decided to ""wrap"". Given that the other non-1913 pieces were almost entirely unnecessary (Valentino's funeral???), I think the over-all structure was flawed as a result.On a positive note, the characterization was very good, and I thought that this had the best dialogue, especially from Adele Varga, of any of Estleman's books."
2,Cheap cologne,"I have been using the product for about 1 month. Since I have a beard I don't have to clean my shaver that often. Suppose to last 1 month but will last longer for me unless it evaporates first. The solution and filter clean the shaver great. But I give it a low rating because it stinks!!! Smells like some cheap cologne. To get past the smell, I run the cleaner in the late afternoon. Prior to going to bed I pull the shaver up some so that it will drain well and vent out the odor. Why they selected the odor is beyond my comprehension."
4,Hard to find,"The major benefit of buying this through Amazon is that it's so hard to find it anywhere else. If I had realized how hard to find it is, I'm not sure I'd have bought the razor. That said, the product is a good one."
4,Will to Play....,"I gave this four out of Five stars due to the tthin page count for a hardcover. Great bok and a good addition for the GODLIKE game. Lots of examples of characters and background info on the Nazi superhumans. The book is a must for anyone GMing GODLIKE and a good read for those just playing or just wanting to be entertained, Dennis Detweiler is an excellent writer and does in research. It shows in this book."
1,"""Music"" ?","I did learn some spanish, but the ""music"" was quite bad, I always fastforwarded through that. No melodies ever. There was way too much English, conversations on the set, etc. Also the tape broke after a few times through."
5,Helpful,This book explains the Yin and Yang and the Western philosophies of medicine. It helps and gives suggestions and the reasoning behind different stages in a woman's medical life.
5,This book was introduced in a women's magazine,I first read about this book in a women's magazine. Several ailments were described and I tried the one where it was recommended to take Withanolides for Insomnia. I went and got the herb and the product that they talked about at my local Vitamin Shoppe store and that stuff really works!! I have tried several well known herbs who are suppossed to relax you and make you sleep better but this one is really the best. After that I bought the book and it's great. It's an easy read and gives Chinese medicine the attention it deserves. I recommend this book to everyone.
5,Amazing Book!!!,"I received this book from my parents in October and it has already changed my life! It is not only easy to read, concise, and full of helpful information, but it is inspiring as well. It has motivated and inspired me to eat more healthy, chose natural remedies and continue to exercise. The book makes a wonderful gift for any woman, young or old.I highly recommend it!!!"
3,Something's Missing,"I have to say I was disappointed after reading this book. I think it is a useful tool for learning the technical terms associated with publishing. However, I needed a little more information regarding the dos and donts. Cheryl Ann Woodard's book has all the nuts and bolts. I couldn't put it down."
1,Contains cancer causing chemical,Contains a chemical known in the state of California to cause cancer and reproductive harm.
2,It does contain dangerous preservatives.,"Though the seller proclaims that it is preservative, paraben, sulfate free, the ingredient list shows such preservatives as propilen glycol and butilen glycol, which are used in producing antifreeze liquids for the cars products, and being absorbed by the skin and with time cause breast and other forms of cancer. These preservatives are also added in cheap 3-6 $ cosmetics, so why to overpay for this product if anyway it is going to ruin your health the same way? I dissapointed with the lack of truth, or they think that consumers are stupid and don't understand much in chemicals?"
5,Spiritual Pat,"I've spent the better part of the last 10 yrs reading,studying, & listening to Buddhist literature, primarily Tibetan (esp. Dzogchen), but also Zen & other Paths. A friend of mine turned me on to this because he wanted to explore ""Western, non-lineage"" cases of ""Enlightenment"". This has all the earmarks and language of the classic, advanced levels of Buddhist ""Enlightenment"" or probably more accurately, as the Buddha would say, Awakening."
5,Beyond Nirvana,"What would a book relate that begins with a journey where ""Cosmic Consciousness"" is just the beginning? The spiritual experiences related by Merrell-Wolff are indeed remarkable, in that they purport to delineate realms where the experience of Nirvana is merely the start of a spiritual journey. The coincidence of intellectual genius coupled with transcendantal spiritual experiences is indeed rare, but as a result of this fortuitious combination of attributes the author is able to articulate as nearly as language permits that which cannot really be articulated."
3,Great looking amp,"Big pyle fan here love the way pyle audio products look i just wish they would perform as well, highest watts i was able to put out with the amp maxed out and the db boost all the way up was 350 watts per channel not too bad considering the price but far from what is claimed."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I couldn't put this book down. I stayed up reading until 1am when I really, really had to get up early the next morning. It was that engrossing. I wasn't crazy about the ending, but overall the book was a true page turner."
4,Odd Thomas,"Odd Thomas is the first book I have read by Dean Koontz and I really did enjoy it. Odd himself was an absolute wonderful character. He is a simple guy with simple dreams, but a 6th sense that gets him into all sorts of trouble. This story keeps you on your toes and in the end has a twist that I never would have suspected. I would definitely recommend this book and will be checking out some of Koontz's other books as well."
5,"Excellect reading, interesting characters","I haven't read a Koontz book in years. I use to read his work a lot when I was a teenager. The title and cover on ""Odd Thomas"" caught my eye, so I thought to give him another chance. I am glad I did. The characters are memorable. The story went into Hollywood action scenes a little, but you are so emphatic with the character at that point you can brush it off. I didn't figure out the entire plot before it was over, which always is a plus. I actually enjoyed the characters so much; I didn't really care if there was a pivotal or climatic scene. I just like learning about Odd and his life and how he interacted with those around him. I listened to the CD of this book while commuting. The reader did an excellent job. He captured the voices of all the different characters well and made for a very convincing Odd Thomas. I highly recommend listening to the audio book on this one."
5,Odd Thomas,"Having not read Dean Koontz for many years i purchased this story out of curiosity, I loved the characters & writing style, the story & its series are thoroughly enjoyable , i am definitely hooked!"
4,Excellent characters,"Good read. Joyful yet sad, can't wait to share more adventures with Odd Thomas. Dean Koontz is a master with words."
3,Odd Thomas,Good book. Was better than I expected. I cried at the end. Looking forward to reading the next in the series.
5,Great read,"AmazingAbsolutely amazing, I can't wait to read the others!!!I highly recommend it, it's one of the best books I've read in years"
3,Flattery for M. Night Shyamalan,"I am one of the few people who doesn't have rave reviews for this book. I saw ""Odd"" as a knockoff of the main character from the movie ""Sixth Sense,"" which is one of my favorites. Listening to the audio version didn't help either--the narration was very monotone and lackluster. Perhaps it would have been better with a more seasoned audiobook artist or multiple narrators.Since Dean Koontz is one of my favorite authors, I decided to give the sequel ""Forever Odd"" a try. I am only on the first CD and, unfortunately, there is a character resembling the main character in ""Unbreakable,"" another M. Night Shyamalan movie. So, all in all, I am disappointed. Perahps things will look up as I get deeper into the narration.For those out there who've never tried a Dean Koontz selection, try ""Watchers"" or ""Seize the Night"" instead. His classic stuff is much better!"
3,Really not Odd enough...,Odd Thomas is a good book. The pace is brisk and the characters are interesting but not very well developed.Dean Koontz is successful because he writes enjoyable novels.The glowing reviews that suggest that this is a great novel and among Koontz' best work are way off target. It's a good story and that is enough for me.
3,good not great,"Dean Koontz is a master storyteller that I have long enjoyed. This book, however, was so so and not my favorite among his many excellent works. I've long felt that he is massively underappreciated but the genius of his work is not evident here. The story drags alot and fills up pages with alot of detail that, quite frankly, I didn't need to know for the story or the development of the characters. Still, the story was there which pulled me to finish it. Good not great."
2,Disappointing...,"I think that I found this book disappointing for two reasons. First, I have read several of Mr. Koontz's other books, and was disconcerted while discovering that this book is nothing like any of them. Having enjoyed his other novels a great deal, I was in the mood for more of the same. I respect that an author broadening his horizons is generally a good thing, but only as long as his work remains original. Which brings me to the second reason I probably found this book disappointing. A friend of mine loaned me Stephen King's Bag of Bones a few weeks back. To someone familiar with this King novel, Odd Thomas could be uncannily described as a Bag of Bones, Jr. While I also enjoyed Bag of Bones, I wasn't in the mood to read its adolescent clone."
3,What the Eff?,"Now, I have not read the book, which is why i gave it a neutral rating. HOWEVER:Based on Amazon's synopsis, I am immediately appalled by the striking similarities between this book and a certain classic horror movie. No, not sixth sense. The Frighteners by Peter Jackson, starring Michael J. Fox. COME ON! IT'S THE SAME THING!I will read the book however."
1,Disjointed,"The first chapter of this book put me over the edge. I couldn't take it anymore. This is the first book I've read by Koontz, so I am hopeful that all of his books aren't like this. The first chapter introduces at least 25-30 characters, none of which I was particularly interested in. Obviously there are many readers who like this ""flakey"" style of writing. I just want to read a story. Guess I'll stick to James Lee Burke, Stuart Woods, James Patterson, etc. This book is to involved for me."
4,Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz,A wonderful book with a very special young man named Odd Thomas who can see the dead and other strange things. The author must be a very nice man or he couldn't have invented such an awesome human being!
5,Meet Odd,Just from his name you know there's got to be a good story. And there is. Odd wants so badly not to be the person with the abilites he possesses but it's his Destiny.
4,Fascinating Characterization,"Odd Thomas is an exploration in fascinating character development. Odd is certainly one of the most unique characters in fiction. Koontz does a great job in weaving a world that is outlandish and realistic at the same time. Every time I set the book down, I found myself going back for more.This is a great read and worth investing in."
3,Sorry Dean....,"I love Mr Koontz. He is one of my favorite adventurers in literature. BUT....I have to give this adventure of my friend Odd Thomas a medium review. Its a very droll and also very uninteresting book.Saying that harsh comment,I still cant wait for the next one. I will always be a fan...no matter what.....Merry Holidays everybody...."
3,journey,Begins a long and wonderful journey with the prolific Mr. Koontz and his Odd creation. Enjoy.
5,Odd Thomas,"When I started this book I really wasn't a Dean Koontz fan but I had heard in a book store about the Odd Thomas Series and so I just HAD to have it. Am I ever glad I did! It is a touching, heart warming book, not the terror I expected! Thankfully I have all the Odd Thomas books! And I recommened this book to everyone who loves a good hero even is his name is Odd Thomas!!!"
4,Short & Sweet review,"Like I said, short and sweet:a) Better than most of Koontz' recent work, but;b) Reminds me a lot of Stephen King's ""The Dead Zone"", i.e. gentle, reflective protagonist with unwanted powers, lots of bittersweetness, etc. etc.Still a worthy read, though -- the pacing is spot on, the characters quirky and amusing (e.g. Terrible Chester, the ""urine-filled"" cat), and the writing has a spare, brisk freshness."
4,"Alot to Like in ""Odd""","Dean Koontz has come up w/some memorable heroes in his books, but Odd Thomas is one of the best. From Chris Snow, who could not go out in daylight, to the talking dog in ""Watchers"", Mr. Koontz really gets into the minds of his characters.I was hooked on this book from the first page and read it all in a day. If you like horror, suspense and mystery type books, I think you'll really enjoy ""Odd Thomas"". Highly recommended."
5,Koontz at his best!!,I am a huge fan and read everything he writes. But this book was the best I have read in a long time. I got it for Christmas and finished it before New Year's. That is tricky with 3 small children but I couldn't put it down!!
3,Not as good as the first one,"I liked the original Odd Thomas a lot. There was sadly a lot less Elvis in this one. And it was more sexual, which was ok, but hardly made you feel more connected to the main character. Not as good as the first one, imho. And I miss Stormy. I think it was cheap literature to kill her off."
2,Not one of his better books,"I had high hope for this book, but they were crushed quite quickly after reading about 10 chapters.All of it was mush and boring. I mean if you are going to give someone the ability to see demons, at least make it more exciting.Normally Koontz doesn't disappoint me, but this was the only book that I could not read all the way through."
5,A truly wonderful book,"I really can't express enough how great ""Odd Thomas"" was. Anyone who claims Dean Koontz has lost his creativity or talent need only read this book. Wonderful characters, a quirky-as-hell sense of humor, a few disturbing moments (most involving some very evil human antagonists) and an uncharacteristically sad ending for a Koontz book. I read this back in November of 04' and a High School freshman and yet I can still remember almost every page in detail. A great, wonderful read.Hands down, Koontz's best non-horror story."
3,"A ""supernatural"" thriller that was hardly supernatural","When I first picked Dean Koontz, my friends and my aunt really wanted me to read Odd Thomas, but instead I went to Frankenstein series before I picked up Odd Thomas. Both my friends and aunt aid it was about a guy who see's ghosts and saves his onw town, but they didn't say how he saved his town or what was the enemy.So when I first started Odd Thomas, I was glued to the pages from the very beginning as he sees a ghost and chases her killer. But then half way through, I realized that this supernautral book was hardly a ghost story than a human killer. And it seemed to lost its touch from there, and there was one scene that reminds me of Velocity (where he transport a dead body and dumps it).I'm not saying Odd Thomas was a bad book, but I have higher expactations with it. So if you want to read a ghost story, even though there are about six ghosts and most of the story is about a human killer, I suggest you read another spooky story."
4,A friend mentioned it so I checked it out.,"And I am so glad that I read it. I had put Koontz away ten years ago because I thought his stories became too much like a formula, but this one is different.Readers will like the main character because of his innocence in all that he deals with. They will be intrigued by his gift. The other characters and setting provide interesting detail and humor, even in tense moments.It kept me reading until I had to go to sleep, then opening the book the next day when I had time. It was fun. Period."
2,Okay Book,"I listened to the audio book and the actor did a great job. Odd Thomas starts off intriging and amusing. As the story progresses , I have a difficult time maintaining interest in the story. I wish Koone's character Odd Thomas had more encounters with the dead.Odd Thomas is a good character, but I didn't care for the plot."
1,"Enough, already!","I've read several books by Koontz now and this is the worst. It takes so long for him to get to the point that everything is anticlimatic. I don't need to know the background of every minor, passing character. I don't care about all the sappy, stupid, overly cute banter of the characters - it just goes on and on and on.........This book could have been 1/2 the length and been better for it.The Frankenstein series is great, but this - PULEEZ! I also read Relentless and it's about as bad - only with even more ""cute"" whimsical banter that makes me want to vomit.I read this book in 2 days - the first day I put up with it, the second I skimmed as fast as I could to the end. It's an interesting premise, but riuned by all the detail and irrelevant non-action."
4,Odd Thomas is a unique character,"This book is not what I expected. All this time I thought Dean Koontz was writing regular crime novels. A bit morbid but great storytelling. Unique book, unique characters."
3,Starts off slow,"This book starts off really slow I think. The punch and the climax are amazing and the end is great but everything leading up the climax seems too slow. There was too much unneeded repetition of the proving his ""oddness"". Overall, not his best book, but it worth reading if you have a few hours to kill."
4,One of Koontz's better recent books,"I just finished reading Odd Thomas. Although I was a little disappointed in the ending, it was a really great book. Some of Koontz's recent books haven't been as good. This one is different from his early books, but I like the freshness it had to offer."
5,4th Koontz book I've read...,"I only recently got into Dean Koontz. I was laid up after orthopedic surgery and a friend brought ""Life Expectancy"" by for me to read...soon thereafter it was a trip to the library where I picked up ""The Taking"", ""Seize The Night"", and ""Odd Thomas""...I really enjoyed this book. ""Life Expectancy"" and ""The Taking"" really gripped me and scared me a little...""Seize the Night"" really didn't do much for me and I took a break from reading Koontz for a few days. ""Odd Thomas"" got me hooked back in...what a wonderful protagonist...the pain that lingers at the twist filled ending really tore at me. I won't discuss it much further as to not give anything away, but it's a very personal book, with some of the sweet elements of ""Life Expectancy"" with quite a bit more dark turns."
4,"Good Read--Very entertaining, makes you care.","I just finished this book last night, and I couldn't stop thinking about it, even as I slept. It was a very interesting story, I enjoyed imagining the world Koontz created, and he made me care about the characters. I think sometimes Koontz overuses description and creative flourish, and alliteration (it does seem like padding or experimentation), but if you can overlook that you will enjoy a great read. There were a couple of things in the plot that weren't developed/explained, but again, the book is worth reading even so.In my opinion, Koontz's best books are ""Watchers"", ""Dark Rivers of the Heart"", and ""The Face"". I also thoroughly enjoyed ""Odd Thomas"", ""The Bad Place"", ""Tick Tock"", ""Demon Seed"", and ""Lightning"". I'm probably leaving some other favorites out, but there's a good reading list for anyone interested."
4,I Really LIke Odd Thomas.,Odd Thomas is a great character. Very easily likable. Easy to sympathize with and a joy to walk beside in a book.
5,Great writing!!well worth the read!,"I may be one of the few people who might be interested in the ODD THOMAS books who is just getting around to reading this masterpiece of writing. Whether you like the story or not, this book is well worth the read just to treasure Koontz's writing ability!Odd Thomas is definitely a different twenty year old young man. The first person perspective of the book allows the reader to truly get into Odd's thoughts and emotions. Though there is a real 'thriller' aspect to the book, the addition of humor, and a deep philosophy adds a feeling of wonder and fun to the suspense.I wonder though, has anyone else noticed the similarities between this book and the more recent novel, 11-22-63 by Stephen King? Another great writer! Reading these two books together for a book group might make for a interesting discussion."
4,Great read,Odd thomas is a great book that makes you think about everyday life... He is a fry cook with a gift he uses his gift to help people he has a girlfriend great friends and a great life until one day he sees fungus man I found myself not putting this book down until I was finshed great book!
5,Wonderful read and page turner!,"I have never read Dean Koontz before but my mother and a few other people were raving about this book so I gave it a try. I was so happy I did because I absolutely loved it from beginning to end. Odd Thomas is such a likeable and intelligent character and Koontz does a fantastic job at making the reader ""feel"" for what happens to him. He develops him so well that I find myself wanting to meet Mr. Thomas.This is a wonderfully refreshing book (but it does have it share of dark moments, of course) and I higly recommend it!"
5,Great Book Highly recommend!!!!!!!!!,"Odd Thomas - Rate High -Book was great, I liked because it kept your interest, fast reading but I couldn't put down."
3,Unbelievably odd,"I like Koontz, but couldn't buy Thomas or his relationships, was disappointed at the ending and don't think I'll read the others in this series"
4,"Odd Thomas, A Very Good Read",This is one of Koontz most endearing and 'diffferent characters'. Who would expect that a short order cook who sees dead people is the only person who could save hundreds of lives? I don't want to give away any of the story but certainly want to say that I look forward to other books about Odd. I liked this book very much.
5,Odd,"This book was on sale for 1.99, so I took a chance I am glad I did. REALLY different story for me.I liked it so much that I intend to follow this series now."
3,"Uneven, but there's some fun to be had.","As usual Mr. Koontz has written another interesting and suspenseful story. However, as has happened with some of the recent Koontz books, sometimes the premise of the story is more interesting than the actual finished book. I won't divulge specifics because like most readers I hate reviews which give away plot points, but there are a couple of matters which are brought up in the story and are never satisfactorily explained. Considering the book is less than 400 pages long, the middle of the story seems artificially padded while the ending is way too abrupt. Nonetheless it is not Koontz's worst novel and the story does have some good moments. The ending is particularly bittersweet and leaves you wanting more."
3,took forever to make something happen,"This book was a gift from my sister because she knows how much I love Dean Koontz. This definetley wasnt one of his best..in my opinion. There was so much explaining that it took forever for anything to happen with it. Every time it looked like the main event was gonna happen, it went on with another 4 chapters of nothing. overall, I did like it though. It was interesting, and somewhat morbid. I was very disappointed by the character that ended up dying at the end, but not all that surprised. So, I would recommend this book, just not if you're looking for a lot of action"
3,Good book,I was a bit hesitant on reading this book. I'm happy I did. It's a very good. I look forward to reading the series. Odd is a great character. Thank you Mr. Koontz
3,Enjoyable,I thought this book was good. I'm a Dean Koontz fan but I didn't this was one of his best.
5,Still a Master,"An Excellent book...vintage Koontz. Odd Thomas was a book I hated to finish and like all of his novels, the characters seem to leap off the pages. Highly recommended!!"
4,"Well written, good story and wierd people, just like Koontz","I will never buy another Dean Koontz book!! I enjoyed this one until I was informed that I couldn't re-sell it. Koontz won't allow resale. If he doesn't have enough money by now, he never will be satisfied and I won't participate in his egomania."
1,worst book ever,"Worst written book ever structuraly and plot wise. The author has the worst writing technique ever. He talks about something them moves on then goes back and you easily get lost. Action in the book doesn't make sense. As if the writing structure wasn't enough torture to go through, the plot also wreaks. The killers turn out to be police officers, people you barely were introduced to in the book. That isn't a twist!!! A twist is where you are introduced to someone in a book in depth and you least suspect them of being murderers. In this book, the killers are ""Suddenly"" police officers which we bareley know. Total waste of time and money. Worst book ever. It deserves a negative rating. People who gave it 5's obviously are easily amused or the badly written structure of the book forced them to day dream while reading and they thought their day dream was the book. They need to wake up."
4,"The intriguing character, Odd Thomas","Odd Thomas is the name of the main character in this book, which is told in first person. Reading this story you will find that he is a very likable and humble person. He does have an unusual endowment that lets him see the dead and other types of apparitions. He tries to use this ability to help those who have passed from this world, and also people who are still living. This is a ""good vs. evil"" type story. It may sound like the ""The Six Sense"", but I would not care to compare the two. Basically it was a nice and entertaining book to read."
3,Unsatisfying,"Since we are told that the book we are reading was written by Odd, perhaps he should get the blame for what to me was an unsatisfying read, especially since I have enjoyed many of Koontz's other works. The writing seems flat and lacking any real emotion. There are interesting characters, but there just isn't enough plot to stretch over so many pages. I found myself rapidly reading the second half of the book just to get to see what happens at the end, not out of any excitement or horror at what was being revealed."
2,A fairly well written piece of genre fiction,"This book was selected for my book discussion group, and that's why I read it. It is an easy and quick read, but very much of the supernatural/thriller genre. There is no shortage of cliches, and virtually no literary merit or significance beyond pure entertainment. Just about all of the characters are either really good or horrendously evil, no semblance of a real human being to be found. A classic airplane book and suitable if you merely want to pass the time, without gaining anything from the time spent."
3,Our unfailing interest in the supernatural...,"I just finished reading this book. Since we all have subconscious interest in the supernatural, it's definitely interesting to read Odd's perspective of seeing the dead. As Odd explains his fiction take on the afterlife, he enlightens our imaginations. We learn the different between spirits and poltergeists, both to which mystify the mind. A very clever read, with all types of emotions built in, keeps the reader wondering what's next - and never guessing right - and keeps the pages turning.Unfortunately a good book misunderstood by overall hype, don't read the reviews 1st, just read the book!"
3,OK quick read,"I had never read a Dean Kootz book before and thought I'd give him a chance. I liked the book, just did not love it. Something was missing but I am niot sure what exactly. A quick read and it was fine, just not dazzzling for my taste."
4,I enjoy reading the Odd Thomas series,"I've read the first four of the Odd Thomas novels before, and am reading them all again in preparation of his new books in the series. I enjoy the series. They are well written and keep you reading. I like most of Dean Koontz's novels, and tend to read all of his stuff."
5,oddthomas,I loved odd thomas.. I didnt like the sequels half as much.... It was an all around wonderful book in my opinion. Koontz is just one of those very rare authors in which I can just pick up any of his books and have faith that it will be good. Ive probably read 15 of his books and have only been slightly disappointed in 1 of those.
2,Odd Book,"What's odd about Odd Thomas is that he can see dead people. He must use his sixth sense to stop something evil from happening in less than 48 hours. What, he doesn't know, but he sees bodachs-shadowy creatures who always appear before a carnage-everywhere in the sleepy town of Pico Mundo. All their attention seems to center around a new person in town: Bob Robertson. Odd, with the aid of his endearing girlfriend Stormy, rushes to solve the mystery before the ill-fated, violent catastrophe occurs. Koontz's writing is nauseating at times. The persistent and irrelevant streams of consciousness about Odd's Granny and other minutia detract from the story. Odd's character also flirts from one place to the next for no apparent reason other than to introduce the reader to Odd's mother or father. The premise had potential, but it doesn't live up to expectations. Not recommended."
5,Wonderful Characters,"This is the best of Koontz's novels that I've read so far. It is relatively short where some of his other work is way too long. The protagonist, Odd Thomas, is a Good Samaritan with more than his share of quirks and special talents. Odd's insights are both wise and humorous. Koontz does his usual great job of developing each character while telling the story. The characters are people who you can really get into, even the dead ones. All of the characters - even the bad guys - are believable within the context of the story. I highly recommend this novel."
5,What a great book!,"I loved reading this book and did not want it to end. Oddie is a wonderful character and I hope Mr. Koontz writes more books based on him.Reading this book was a very uplifting experience, which might seem odd to say about a ""thriller,"" but that is the only term I can ascribe to this tome.Odd is so richly drawn, he seems like an actual person, not a work of fiction. You would definitely want him as a friend!"
5,"Great book, utterly heartbreaking.","I could not put down this book. I don't think I've read a Koontz book in over five years, and yet this one pulled me in. I can't wait to read the rest, even though my heart aches because of this one."
4,One of the better authors I've read recently,I've been reading numerous adventure-fiction books lately and this one is probably my favorite in my pile so far. Its written well and you get a feeling for some of the characters that make them lovable. Its definitely worth a read!
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","My first Odd Thomas novel and it left me wanting to read more. However as a matter of principle I almost never pay more than $5 for a downloadable Kindle book ...so I will have to wait until the next one goes on Kindle Daily deals.Despite his name, Odd quickly grows on you and I always enjoy a supernatural aspect to stories, which Koontz does quite well in this one. Surprise ..and unexpected ending definitely made me want to know what Odd will do next.So reduce those Kindle prices, Amazon or Publisher or whoever is responsible ... $9 or more for a digitally delivered book is just not right."
5,Odd Thomas~dynamic and riveting read,"This story is fast-paced and an anxious page turner. I couldn't put it down, yet was scared to see what mayhem was to come. Loved the book. The characters were so real (sweet, funky, aunties and uncles I might have)."
3,Wordy,"Interesting story, but in many places the language was too wordy. I got bored when it would go on and on."
3,A quick and enjoyable book that ultimately left me a bit flat,"Koontz does a good job introducing an interesting hero, along with a nicely fleshed out supporting cast. The writing was smooth, often humorous, and did a great job of pulling me through the story. I have not read Koontz in over a decade, but his imagination for horror is still very strong, and he builds a convincing world.There was only one downside, and to me it is a somewhat major one; I felt that I got cheated on the plot. The overall plot is interesting enough, a supernatural murder mystery (with save-the-world bonus features), but (without spoiling any details) the process through which this mystery is solved is utterly and completely unsatisfying. I imagine this will be not be a big deal for many horror/thriller fans.I'd say if you're looking for a good light read, with a main character that you can't help but like, and generally a good sense of humor (amid all the blood), this is not a bad choice."
4,This Series is Addictive!,"I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter books, and this novel contains some of the same elements. Like the Potter series, the Odd Thomas series by Dean Koontz defies categorization, containing elements of fantasy, horror, contemporary fiction, humor, and mystery. In Odd Thomas, you'll find well-developed characters and a suspenseful plot combined with humor and a touch of the supernatural. Odd is a 20 year old fry cook from Pico Mundo, CA who is able to chat with the deceased who have not yet ""moved on,"" and often is able to help them do so. His sixth sense also enables him to see shadowy figures, called bodachs, who congregate before catastrophic events. Another interesting twist is provided by Odd's occasional companion, the ghost of Elvis. I've read all of the books in the Odd Thomas series thus far, and look forward to reading more of his adventures."
5,Page turner,"This book is awesome! I loved it and could not put it down. The second and third were not quite as good, but still addicting."
1,Hate Hate Hate This Book,Man do I hate Odd Thomas...This is a winding ride of a read that takes you through highs and lows ins and outs only to drop you to a depressingly dead thud in the end. All that work and expectation to be left deadly dissapointed in the end is not worth the read or your precious time on this earth. I know for certain I would have dropped this book as quickly as a rattle snake if I could have for saw it's downer of an ending. This book definitely falls in the DO NOT BOTHER AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME category of books I have read.
1,B-o-r-ing,"Why do I continue to read Dean Koontz books? Probably because I am always sucked in by the great reviews and keep hoping that this time they are true -- really-- who can possibly give this book 5 stars? Found this the same as all his other books----- no plot, boring, predictable, unimaginative (shades of the dementors and Lost-- aren't we tired of black shadowy beings flitting about?) - Waste of time and money"
1,Is someone writing for Dean?,"Wow.. this is the second book by Koontz that I've been disappointed in. What happened to the guy who wrote Intensity? I bought ""The Face"" and thought.. is he having someone else write for him? Where's his sense of humor? Although there is a sense of humor in this book and The Face, it sure doesn't sound like Dean Koontz's brand.This story has been done. The ""I see dead people"" thing and ""I help them to let go of this world"". I think next time I buy one of his books, I'll read through the first few pages to see what ""Dean"" I'm getting. And whoever is writing for Dean.. STOP IT!!"
1,TERRIBLE!!,"My husband and I both wasted our time reading this and I have read a lot of Koontz's books and this is the WORST!! I wonder if he was paid per word for this book! Most of the book was detailed useless information about nothing over and over. The part about the black room was interesting and Koontz spent lots of time and detail on it and then never really mentioned it again as if he just decided to change the story, but leave that part in to take up room to meet his word-count quota. The actual story was so predictable! Save your time and read something(anything) else!"
1,Too bad,"Started out with lots of promise (best story line and writing he's done sense Fear Nothing and Seize the Night barring the excessive surf lingo etc.) but died around page 190. Koontz makes Odd and his girlfriend Stormy (dumb name) into two perfect little angels -- when playing cards Odd can feel, 9 times outta 10, when his hand is stronger than those of other players and when it is not, so he wouldn't DARE go to Vegas and gamble to make money (what Odd calls ""harvesting cash""), ""it'd be the same as stealing"" , ""I don't need money"", ""I don't ever want to go anywhere"" ""I just want to be a fry cook or a tire salesman for the rest of my life"" GET REAL!After that the story, the characters and writing dies. Becomes juvenile. Too much padding with Odd's endless ruminations."
1,Not Recommended,"This is the author of such terrific books as ""Watchers"" and ""Intensity"", isn't it? My question to you Mr. Koontz is: ""What happened?"" Granted, this author is a genius with flowery, descriptive prose, but that seems to be the only thing he is doing in this book. I kept asking: Can we get on with the story here? The reader has to wait forever to get to the point.It is unfortunate that such a wonderful writer seems to be losing his touch. (Maybe a new editor is needed to light a fire under him?) The characters run the gamut from being annoying (Odd Thomas himself) to downright hateful (Odd Thomas' mother).The story itself is plodding at first and then turns very unpleasant. Unfortunately, it never redeems itself.I don't like to be so negative, but this is not an enjoyable story. Hopefully, Mr. Koontz will be a little less mean-spirited with his characters and a little more plot driven in his future books."
4,New Twist on an Old Idea,"I have not been an avid Koontz reader, but the idea behind this novel intrigued me. I mean who isn't now attracted to the idea of, ""I see dead people""?. I was pleasantly surprised at how Mr. Koontz turned that idea around and not only made fun of that line itself but managed to do something new with the idea.I agree that there were some slow parts. I felt the voice was hard to adjust to at first but I had to realize that it was intended to be a 20 year old male (which I am not).This is well worth a read, even in hardback :)"
2,I am a big Koontz fan but disliked this book...,"I am a big fan of Koontz's writing, having read many of his books by now - The Husband, Velocity, Life Expectancy, One Door Away from Heaven, Intensity, etc. His books usually grip me in suspense and have unpredictable twists and turns that keep the reader interested. I listened to this audio book and it was horrible. It goes on and on about the most random things with such detail that it's boring and made my mind drift. I did not even get interested in the story until the 33rd chapter. Then, it drops off again at about chapter 47. The ending is so non-climactic it's sad. It's a waste of time."
3,Good but could have been better,"I read ""Brother Odd"" (which I think is better) first, so going into this one I already knew what the result of the bodach-attracting event would be. Even so, it still emotionally affected me.I think this is a good book but it has a lot of faults, too. It's unbelievable to me that Odd's mother could still be walking around free. The excuse is that she isolates herself to keep from feeling suicidal/homicidal, but I still don't buy it.As others have mentioned, the action sometimes gets bogged down. I found the coyote scene boring and just too much on top of all the other stuff Odd is dealing with at that moment.I appreciated the twist as to the killer's identity but at the same time did not find it interesting or shocking."
4,can't wait to get back in the car,I listened to this while I went to and from work. Time just flew by. The suspense was wonderful.
5,Odd Thomas....Wow!,"Great read....finished the book in 2 days....could not put it down...now I have to go get ""Forever Odd"". this is a great character....Mr. Koontz's characters really get under your skin. The never ending battle between good and evil rages on."
5,Awesome,Awesome! I look forward to the next one. As always Dean keeps me hooked from page one to the end.
4,Disturbingly entertaining,"Like all of Dean Koontz's books, you never what lurks on the next page that will catch you off guard. Can't say any more without giving away the ending."
2,Not for me,"Read other Dean Koontz, but really just could not get into this. May try another one in the Odd Thomas series at some point but not right away"
4,Odd Thomas Series,"I think Koontz has created a very likable character in Odd Thomas. I like the character and the overall story was entertaining but it tends to read as if Koontz is like the high school kid trying to impress the ""smart girl"" with his use of big words. Some of the terminology used in certain situations would infer Odd has a much deeper working knowledge of things he really would have no way of knowing."
4,koontz delivers with Odd Thomas,"I have read other Koontz books but Odd Thomas is one of my favorite characters. The short order cook who makes heavenly pancakes and sees things that no one else sees, is both endearing and fascinating. Though Koontz writes other books, Oddie is my favorite of his characters; good horror with a twist."
5,Oddly wonderful,Odd is the guy next door that you wished you had.....he is reality wrapped up in magic and served with a slice of humanity.
4,Pleasantly Odd,Koontz does a masterful job of integrating faith concerns in a page turning thriller - with quirky characters you will come to love. A different view of the shadows that haunt our culture today.
4,"""Oddly"" compelling","I read the second Odd Thomas book before I knew there was a first, which was fortunate in a way, because the second book was better than the first. I have ordered the third in the series but not yet received it. This is lite reading, but enjoyable. Koontz has just enough body to his characters to help the reader identify with them. Though not a big fan of Koontz, this little series is delightful. PGebo"
5,A well spun tale,Koontz smartly weaves a tale of intrigue and heart and constantly keeps you guessing what is really happening in the world of Pico Mundo. Compelling read highly recommended.
4,Odd is excellent.,"The first in the series of the Odd Thomas books, is an excellent easy read. You really enjoy the characters. I've just purchased the kindle version, but I have read the paperback twice."
4,The first page and a half of this book is rediculous,"I'm not sure who I blame more for the shabby, poorly-thought opening paragraphs, Koontz or his editor. There is a serious blunder in the opening of this book. It begins with Odd wondering why anyone would want to read about his exploits. ??? He sees dead people, bodachs, travels in time ... and wonders why anyone would be interested in him? Odd would have to be dumber than a cracker to believe this, but his character as it develops in the book is not so naive and stupid. This opening is the worst case I can recall of a writer/editor tandem being guilty of an error so gross that it destroys the credibility of the main character. If Koontz had thought at all about this, during the editing, he would have rewritten the beginning. I just don't understand how a writer of his caliber could make such a mistake. Anyway, I'll keep reading his books because at some point in his novels there's always a plot point that grabs me."
2,Can't even finish book,"I am a huge Koontz fan, but this Odd fellow I just cannot embrace. He is boring to me. I have been trying to finish this one for months, but really don't care to finish it. If not for my admiration of Koontz I might just burn the book so as not to trouble anyone else with reading it."
2,Odd Thomas,I am a Koontz fan!! This was not Koontz at his best. His wonderful sense of suspence was lost in this book--Too many wordy prose..It wasn't fun until the last chapter..The rest was 300 pages of words..
5,Totally bittersweet,I give this book five stars just for the simple fact that Koontz had the nerve to kill off a main character. I was just not expecting that! Otherwise I'd give it a 3 out of 5 just for slow plot development. I'm going to read the second one about Odd just to see what happens so I guess maybe I liked this book more than I thought I did.
1,"I Don't Get All The ""4"" and ""5"" Reviews","Maybe I am not used to Koontz's writings, since this is the first one I have read. Therefore, I approached this book with no positive or negative feelings of Koontz's writings. I was deeply disappointed when I finnished it. I struggled many times against closing the book and putting it down for good, but I kept reading hoping the good parts lay just ahead. But the good parts never came. (This reminds me when my chilren were small and I took them to see ""Peewee's Big Adventure"", because our local movie critic had said that it was ""extremely funny"". Well, we watched that movie waiting for the funny parts and suddenly the end credits began to roll.) Apparently most people who read ""Odd Thomas"" thought as I did because the resale value is less than $1.00. I believe that this book is comparable to Tom Clancy's last two bombs."
2,Not very original,"The title character name is the first of many weaknesses. Odd Thomas? How about Stephen Strange or Lucretia Bizzare? Give me a break. It's an old writer's trick that Koontz should know better about and try to rise above. As for the book, nothing new here, weird happenings, a few twists and turns but nothing really new. The title character IS odd but so what. Give us something we've NEVER imagined and not just a rehash of what's already come before. Or at least make it SEEM new, you know, like your first editor told you from day one?"
4,Koontz at his best,I was always a big fan of Dean Koontz but always got disappointed by the sci-fi aspects of some of his books. This was just a little sci-fi but mainly an excellent thriller. Odd Thomas is a very likeable character with many gifts that keep you guessing what is real or not real throughout the book It has a great ending!
3,Pretty Good,This was pretty good. It is a little out there though. Not the kind of book I normally go for though. I was upset with a few things that happened but for the most part I liked it.
4,Would make an interesting movie,"Odd Thomas has a gift or a curse - he can see the dead. This story is a mixture of mystery, sci-fi / religion (little) and horror, splashed with humor. I chuckled out loud more than once and I read a political book before going to sleep.Odd Thomas moves fast with enough characters and their development to be interesting without dragging or becoming confusing.I do not enjoy books with either an obvious or out of left field behind the fence ending. I enjoyed Odd Thomas."
3,Strived to be Great,"While not his best effort in his overall body of work, ODD THOMAS is most certainly better than Koontz' past few offerings (FTCOHE, ODAFH, The Face and The Taking). Gone is much of the overwriting and endless similies. The characterizations are strong and some of the set pieces are gripping. But these strong moments only make me long for the early Koontz. His characters of late have all evolved to fit into two distinct categories: the pure and god-like or the truely evil, with little to no middle ground. It's hard to identify with either of those extremes. While ODD THOMAS held my attention and introduced several very interesting concepts and ideas, not all ideas were resolved (i.e., the black room), and the ending was very weak (which is another Koontz trademark). I will continue to read Koontz since he remains one of the best popular novelists, but I do hope that he steps back from all of the soapbox stuff for a bit and gets back to having fun!"
3,"Too many analogies, good ending","I found this book to be enjoyable although it was a struggle at times to get past the incredibly sappy dialogue and constant stream of analogies, of which only a small number were good. I found myself extremely uninterested whenever the main character discussed his girlfriend, which was a sizeable portion of the book. Overall though, the idea was pretty good, the action scenes were fairly engrossing and the ending was great.I recommend ""The Bad Place"" instead as a great starting point for anyone new to Koontz."
4,A Great Read!,"I have been Koontz fan since my first book I read of his, Cold Fire. I thought it was imaginitive and a great read. I read many of his books and agree with most reviewers his recent books tend to have more metaphors and similes that tend to push you off focus on the story. I myself tend to slip my eyes off the page every once in a while thinking to myself, Huh? In Odd Thomas the story doesn't move quickly at all but at a gradual pace. I thought it started a little slow but picked up a few chapters in. I enjoyed reading it and I didn't expect the little twist ending. Its a great read and would recommend it."
5,ODD THOMAS is another best seller!!!,"ODD THOMAS is in the same class as SHROUDED INSANITY, by Jamian Snow and BLACK CREEK CROSSING, by John Saul. It has all the tell-tale signs of another best seller. I review books for a living and this one was a thrill. The fact that Dean Koontz re-invented the first person viewpoint is remarkable. It's totally Dean at his finest. New York Book Reviewe"
5,Cheerfully Creepy Sad,"Odd Thomas, the first a a series, is a cheerfully creepy book that is quite fun to read. Odd, the protagonist, has few normal days and strives to balance supernatural needs plus the normal insanity of our world. All while being the best person he can be. Done with great good humor."
1,boring,"i read this book after my barn owner suggested it. she made it sound like a really interesting story and since I love the paranormal I decdided to give it a go. i was disappointed. first off I kinda think its stupid that he can see dead people but they don't talk, it kinda left me thinking ok whats the point. also the story just didn't flow for me at all. there was a bunch of random things that were thrown in there like the time machine, stupid facts about random characters, and the climaxes didn't fit in with the story.I was bored. i'm happy I only paid a dollar for the book."
2,Not for me,"This was my first Dean Koontz book, and I was pretty disappointed given the rave reviews I have heard about him. I am not saying he is a bad writer by any means, but it turned me off to his books.In this book I felt like I had to walk a mile to get 50 feet of story. He seemed to keep going on and on with descriptions of things that had no significance to the story. My main issue was his use of dialog, I'm sorry but people just dont talk like that. Let alone a couple of 20 year olds in some podunk town. The dialog between Odd and his girlfriend was very unrealistic and distracting. He is a great writer, but as said in my title, just not for me."
3,Odd,"""Odd"" is an appropriate title for this book! A little too unbelievable, but interesting premise. Enjoyed it."
3,"Dean is suddenly a ""feeling"" writer","I remember the old Dean Koontz where he used to hang out and write good stuff that jarred your very soul! (Midnight, Watchers, Servants of the twilight, and The Face of Fear) But then things started to go sour! The Door to December? What? All his stories are about how people feel. I want some murder, some bloodshed, some scary stuff! Come on Dean! Blah! The book wasn't too bad, but, gosh, it wasn't too good either!"
2,A unique read!,"I am just getting started, but it is definetely a different type of story. It is good enough to hold my interest, but I have no clue what is yet to come!"
5,Koontz Strikes Again,"This is a great book - I LOVED this book. It evoked almost every emotion a person can feel & I think that's what makes it such a good story. ""Odd Thomas"" is suspenseful, scary, sad & funny. It's a book that can make you tear up one moment & then laugh out aloud."
4,This won me over..,"I had always thought Mr. Koontz wrote books that I wouldn't enjoy, so I never chose this type of reading. While looking for something new to read a co-worker asked if I had read this book (Odd Thomas). I told her that I didn't think that was my type of reading and she talked me into giving it a try on my Kindle. I agreed and I'm so glad that I did for I'm now ready to read all of his books. This was a can't put down book, luckily it was on Kindle so no need to til finished. Thanks to all my friends, Amazon,Mr. Koontz, and certainly to my co-worker."
5,Interesting use of the paranormal,"I've read several of Dean Koontz's books, but this has gotten me into his Odd series. I had to see what Odd was up to next, so I've purchased the next 3 books in the series. They're fast reading and keep me wanting more."
4,Vintage Koontz,"Reading Odd Thomas reminded me of what it was like to read some of his earlier books likeWatchersandWhispers, and that was a very good feeling for me. It has been a long time since I've been spooked by this guy, and an even longer time since I've been really impressed with his writing. Both the spook factor and his writing are in top for here. You won't be sorry for picking this one up. I have to knock off one of the stars, though, because I thought he cheated a little bit. But he warns us that he will be cheating, so I guess I should have expected it. I won't go into any details, only so I won't spoil it for you, but you will know what I'm talking about. Still, this is a great read, and you'll like it if you've ever liked Mr. D. Koontz."
5,First Dean Koontz book I've ever read...,"I know, I know... don't yell at me. It's not that I had anything against the author, it's more that I just never got around to reading any of his work. This came highly recommended and now I'm disappointed I haven't been reading his work sooner."
5,Awesome!,"I have been reading Koontz for years, and happened to stumble upon Odd Thomas. This is so far my favorite Koontz book of all time! Then I found out there is an entire Odd Thomas series, and I am working my way through them.If you have not read Odd Thomas yet, you will absolutely fall in love with Odd and his friends in Pico Mundo. I highly recommend!"
5,A great author.,"I have read all of Dean Koontz""s books. This one several times. Koontz has a way of writing and describing things where I can picture just what he is talking about. The Odd Thomas series is second only to the Maximum Ride series. Odd is an interesting character taken on many adventures by his ""gift""."
5,What a wild ride.,"This was the first novel by Koontz that I've read--but I can assure you it won't be the last. I enjoyed the heck out of this novel. What a terrific ending; I never saw that coming (I won't spoil it for the rest of you reading this). I can hardly wait to start Forever Odd. If you've never read this novel, do yourself a favor and pick this one up and have fun. It will keep you up late at night."
4,A little slow in the middle,"Though overall I liked the book a lot, there were times in the middle of the book when I made myself keep reading because the book got hideously boring. This happened about two times.Other then that, I liked the book a lot. I especially liked the surprise ending. Considering the movie Dean Koontz stole the idea for this book from (Sixth Sense), it probably shouldn't have been a surprise. But it was."
4,Classic Koontz! Recommended listening for your commute.,"Koontz has written a winner this time. Odd Thomas sees dead people, but despite that little quirk, he's an otherwise normal 20 year-old fry cook. Well, maybe not quite normal...An audiobook is made or broken by the reader's performance, and David Aaron Baker does not disappoint. The listener is easily convinced that David is Odd, telling his odd story.Full of action, twists and turns, and Koontz's trademark linguistic acrobatics, Odd Thomas is a great way to lighten up your commute."
1,buyer beware of this internal bug,"Unlike versions up to No. 6, this version require authorization. This means that a single use version can't be loaded on multiple computers. Adobe informed me that this was not a bug and wanted me to buy multiple copies eventhough I am only using one computer at a time. This version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install. When I found out that my legal version couldn't be used, it forced me to reinstall version 6, this took almost an hour to install, reboot, un-install and reinstall the orginal version. Why is Adobe the only company that forces this? Their program installation don't even skip from one set of four numbers to the next. They force you to type the dashes between the numbers.If you have multiple computers stay away from anything above version 6."
1,Review of the Texican,"The Texican appeared to be a spaghetti Western. The scenery and horseswere typical of Spain. The story line was not all that exciting. Usualbrutish bad guys of spaghetti westerns. Surprised that Murphy would lendhimself to this type of western. Audie is starting to show his age. Possibly good roles were not available to him because of disapation,drinking."
4,A revenge film,"This 1966 88 minutes film stars Audie Murphy as a sheriff who was falsely accused of a crime and who fled to Mexico to escape capture. It also stars Broderick Crawford as a man who is running a town in Texas and forcing its inhabitants to do his will. Audie has a brother in the town who is against Crawford. He is the editor of a newspaper. Crawford kills him. When Audie hears about the murder he returns to Texas to avenge his death. There are several gun and fist fights before Audie and Crawford meet for a gunfight. Crawford has about four gunfighters who work for him.Audie has four women who try to help him. One is the girl he leaves behind in Mexico. A second is the woman who his brother planned to marry. The third is the wife of a man who was killed when Audie's brother was killed. The fourth is a woman who Crawford wants for himself, but who wants Audie. This infuriates Crawford."
3,Real WWII Hero Gets Spaghetti,"Audie Murphy, the real life WWII Soldier/Hero stars in his only Spaghetti Western.That alone should seal the deal for anyone with any interest in the Italian Western films of the 60s and 70s.Worthy of any Western collection."
3,Nostalgia.,Back way back when I thought Hari Rhodes was the cat's whiskers. The movie is quite good. I just wish Hari had been given more of a chance. It's a nice little movie and certainly above a lot of the rubbish put out today. The world may still have a lot of prblems but at least opportunities exist that did not when this movie was made.
3,Out of Date Technology,"Great book on a dead technology.Cellular [z-wave] is the way to go in 2013. X10 - which is only what this book is about - was the latest in 2008. No one implementing a home security/control system should use X10 technology today. If you can use your cell phone in your house then implement z-wave technology, not X10.Want to view the inside of your home while in Aruba on vacation? You can do it with z-wave - not with X10. Lock your front door but allow only those in you trust on a select basis, find out who's home, what the temp is, is there a break in your water pipes? Have they frozen? Is the dog pooping on the rug and blaming the cat?But even though the technology in this book has been superseded by z-wave it's still a good book for ideas! Just use z-wave modules instead of X10.Check out z-wave.com"
1,"Limited information, not well organized. Of limited value",I was not pleased with this book. Only covered x10 systems and had had VERY limited info. Very outdated information.
1,"Not Smart, not hacks, just basic X-10 for the Home","If you have ever installed an X-10 module then this book is a waste of your money. I purchased this book based on the reputation of O'Reilly as a publisher. But after reading this book I will not make that mistake again.This book contains very basic X-10 information, so if you are intrested in exploring the use of X-10 for the first time this book might be interesting, but I think there are far better places to start.Examples... Hack #1 discribes basic X-10 addressing, hack #2 tells you how to turn on a light.... What a joke. Hack #88 ""Streamline your Apple scripts"" Well, like 95% of the world this has no use to me... I use a PC. Anothe Mac only hack is #91 which is using the mac iCAL program. There is no PC version. Hack #92 is for Charting... And you guessed it... It is for the MAC AGAIN! #93, MAC again...So keep lookng this book not worth the money."
5,good quality,Made of metal of some sort and is of good quality and for the price one cannot complain really. Does what it does !!!
3,Beginner....BEWARE....not a book for the faint of heart.,"The book is very informative regarding the operation of many electronic circuits and their practical application. It is not a place for the beginner to start learning basic electronics. You may require additional reference books to make your way through Mr. Davidson's book. The book is not well coordinated with reference diagrams and pictures to the text. There are a lot of references to diagrams which,in turn, are not visually close to the text. The page flipping gets annoying. Additionally, there are mistakes in labeling schematic diagram components in some chapters. If you do not understand basic circuit operation, these mis-labelings could easily confuse the point Mr. Davidson is trying to make. I used the text for a review and for the practical troubleshooting advice. It served that purpose well. I think that this book will be a good shop reference which I will use often."
3,Hit and Miss,This album is totally hit and miss. While the dirty white trash punk sound is heard throughout the lyrics on more than half the songs are just plain awful. The songs that do have good funny lyrics are awesome though.
5,A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia by Alexander Yakovlev,"This is a must read for every American, high school age and older. It is a concise, graphic, gripping, terrifying and sad story of the Russia produced by the 1917 Bolshevik/Communist Revolution. This is a keeper for those of us who love the Russian people, their books, writers, art, music and Solzhenitsyn. Alexander Yakovlev is an excellent and courageous writer. Kudos to this brave man."
1,One Hit Pop Wonder,"OUCH! Not worth the $$$. If you like 'Walkin on the Sun' but don't know the other songs, then I recommend caution. The rest of the album is fast, loud, and angry. SmashMouth's other cuts reflect the band's name: they smash your ears with every word out of their mouth.This was my lesson in ""Don't buy it if you only know one song."" Luckily it was a free selection for joining a music club."
2,"Not a very durable record, is it?","Well, I have to admit I had to buy it after hearing ""Walking In the Sun"" and ""The Fonz"" , which still are accessible after a while even though I hate the rest of the album, really. Anyway, I did have som high expectations about this one. so, there are those two tracks, which are nice, then there are four songs, which sound good for the 3-5 first times, but which slowly start to irritate ( Let's rock, Why Can't ..., padrino, Flo). Then there are a couple of songs which are prettty neutral, but lame. And then there are the ones that have irritated me since the first listen; for example, ""Disconnect The Dots"" is disgusting teen punk. Yuch!. Well, anyway, to sum it all up, I'd have to say, that ska may attract you at first, but in the long run it's simply one of the most efficient vomiting tools. This album is just another commercially ambitious record with few catchy tunes, but not a bit of durability. And it sure ain't real ska, is it?"
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.,"THIS CD IS HORRIBLE, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO ""ASTRO LOUNGE."" FOR MORE INFORMATION, READ THE REVIEW FROM THAT GUY FROM ""A DISGUSTING PLACE."" ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT THIS CD IS GOOD IS DISGUTING, TOO.PLEASE DON'T BUY IT."
1,This cd is horrible,"The reason i bought this cd was cause of the song ""walking on the sun"". The song is pretty good, but the rest of the songs on the cd are crap!"
2,Not really Smash Mouth...,"This Smash Mouth album is a bit of a disappointment to me because I had listened to Astro Lounge first, then picked up Fush Yu Mang. New Smash Mouth listeners, if you are considering buying a Smash Mouth album, buy Astro Lounge before Fush Yu Mang, because the quality is much better, and because you may decide not to listen to more Smash Mouth if your first impression of the group comes from this album. If a person grows used to Smash Mouth from Astro Lounge and then listens to Fush Yu Mang, it's kind of unrecognizable as Smash Mouth. The music is okay, but it does not sound like Smash Mouth. Also, be aware that while Astro Lounge DOES NOT have profanities, Fush Yu Mang DOES. All in all, if you're looking for good rock music, then this is a good album, but if you're looking for more great Smash Mouth, then you'll be disappointed."
1,it just bites!,"This hunk of @$$ has one good song. And that's only if you add together the half-of-song that ""Walkin' on the Sun"" and ""Why Can't We Be Friends"" are. Heavy radio and video play have made these fools, sheeps in wolves clothing. If you paid a dollar for it you wasted your money and if you got it for free you wasted your time. I wish I could hagve given it negative one star."
3,"Ok, but Astro Lounge is better","This CD is, as others have mentioned, punk rock. If you don't like punk you will NOT like this CD. I like to listen to this CD when I'm doing chores I don't like, because the upbeat nature puts me in a good mood and gives me some energy to get through it. I love Walking On The Sun and I don't mind Why Can't We Be Friends? although I think the latter goes on far too long at the end. The other songs are just average, and I did find that they tended to sound the same after awhile --- it was sometimes hard to hear the lyrics because the music was so loud and overpowering. The lyrics I did hear were good, though....The only caveat is, if you have to choose between it and Astro Lounge, I'd say go with AL."

The only caveat is, if you have to choose between it and Astro Lounge, I'd say go with AL."
5,Surprsingly Good,To all of us who have heard walkin on the sun and think that all of Smashmouth's music resembles it well just forget it. The first track Flo is a fast paced track as is most of the album leading up to the final track a remake of the '70s hit Why Cant We Be Friends. All in all if you like bands with silly profound yet intelligent lyrics I recommend it highly.
3,Good if you feel like bubblegum punk rock,"Walkin on the Sun was the best mainstream record to hit the radio since Loser. Its one of those songs that when you buy the album, you listen to it and as soon as its done you hit the back button and listen to it again with a big smile on your face. Don't buy the album for that song, though, you might be disappointed. Its mainly a bubblegum poppy punk affair with a few moments of inspiration (Padrino was fantastic, Lets Rock was pretty good). I love the punk music (check out Dropkick Murphys or operation ivy if this cd sounds good to you), and, in the style of say, Blink 182, this stuffs aight. Smashmouth has figured something out with Walkin on the Sun, however, and the rest of their work should reflect that."
4,keep listening!!!,"I bought the cd for a friend of mine who liked ""walking on the sun"", and what a shock when we listened to the rest, but as we listened to it all again, we found that we liked it too, so be sure to listen to the whole cd at least twice, it really is great."
3,I was pleasantly suprised,"Wow, If it weren't for the fact that I went to high school with Greg Camp I probably would have never bought this cd. I would have to say it grows on you! I hope the future of Smashmouth is better and they don't turn into a one hit wonder!"
1,aweful!,"DUDE! THIS HAS SWEARS IN IT! THE EDITED VERSION,NOT THE REGULAR! I BOUGHT THIS AND WHAT DID I HEAR?! A SWEAR WORD ! THATS WHAT! IT'S NOT A REGULAR CD IN A CASE THAT SAYS EDITED! THE EDITED VERSION HAS A SWEAR IN IT! READ THE LYRICS-IT SAYS FOUR OF THESE *! DUDE! DONT GET FOOLED!"
4,"Good, but not for fans of Astro Lounge","This CD is full of punk rock music, with the exception of Smash Mouth's hit ""Walkin' on the Sun"", which in my opinion should have been on Astro Lounge instead, because many people are buying this CD just to get that song. You won't find any hits at all similar to ""All Star"" or ""Then the Morning Comes"" or ""Can't Get Enough of You Baby"" on this CD, if that's what you're expecting, skip this CD. But hey, if you like Walkin' on the Sun, get it! Punk rock music lovers will love this, pop music lovers won't."
1,There's a better Fonz,"Don't get the explicit version. The edited version is so much better. The edited version of The Fonz is sooo much better. It has altered and cleaner lyrics. The edited song actually is very funny. Something the explicit version isn't. Also, the edited song is the one featured is a single(one that got radio airplay)."
1,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"This is what annoying music is all about. If I hear anymore it would make me puke. Songs like Why Can't We Be Friends and Walking on the Sun are obnoxious and boring. A warning label should be put on here that state ""Warning May Cause a Headache."""
5,sweet cd i love it $0 i burnt it,i burnt a copy of this cd my big bro lent his copie but i didnt work any more so now that i have a copie im smiling i loved this cd since i was 3 in 1997 i love this cd it has swears but big deal sweet cd my bro got it for walking on the sun and he bought the cd
1,Mishmosh of Noise,"Absolute [junk]. This could have been a good album if more songs like Walkin' on the Sun were on it. Some of the intros are great until the actual songs start like Padrino for example and then they unleash a barrel of noisy, monotonous [junk] that's supposed to be music but bears little resemblance. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Only two good songs...,"There are only two good songs on this C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money."
1,Terrible,"Man, these guys suck. I couldn't stand listening to the 30 second samples. Click out of this page and move on with your life."
5,5 isn't high enough,"this thing rocks! I love it, I've had it almost a year now, I wrote my media report for english class on this recording, my favorite track is ""Nervous in the Alley"" what's weird is before i got this, all I'd heard is ""Walkin' on the Sun"" now it rates up there with (Led) Zeppelin, Barenaked (Ladies), and Aero(smith) man, this rocks, there's this thing saying, Shakespeares Sister ""Hormonally Yours"" right next to me,(boy is that true with one person at my school! he he) I liked this CD cus it's really cool, and it's about real stuff, and it's real, ya know, well I'm not sure if this is long enough(75 words), but if not that's their problem not mine, see ya later! BDage1three"
2,It was not what I expected at all!!!,"It was awful, heavy metal! I thought it would be like mellow alterative or something. Instead what I got was a bunch of noise! The song ""Walking on the Sun"" totally miss leads you! If you like pop and things unlike hard rock, alterative, don't buy this CD."
2,1 good song,"It is weird because i dont really like groups, i like songs, and it happens to be that my favorite song happens to be off of this record ""All-Stars"" but i dont like the rest. they kinda get old but ""All-Stars"" is the best, they just need to keep making songs like that cause their other stuff isn't that good."
4,Forget their latest albums; this is the REAL Smash Mouth.,"With its fast rhythms, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, guitars cranked up to 11, and cheesy CD art, this album screams ""PARTY!"" in no uncertain terms. ""Fush Yu Mang"" is to Smash Mouth as ""Dookie"" is to Green Day or ""Smash"" is to Offspring. Forget their recent albums; this is what Smash Mouth was all about before fame got the better of them. Aside from the requisite radio-friendly track ""Walking On The Sun"" (which is not bad), this is a solid punk-ska set with lots of pleasant surprises. Highly recommended."
5,all around good!,"I loved this c.d. It had a wide variety of style and meaning. Nervous in the Alley was exspecially good because it touched on an issue of runaways and the hardships they face. Beer Goggles was mocking the way guys ""really"" think. It's funny, but some uptight girls may find it offensive. I got the Explicit version and found that the cuss words added to punk song Let's Rock. Fush Yu Mang was an awsome c.d. with a cool combo of rock, punk, and songs that mock certain aspects of society. I strongly suggest any well rounded person to buy this c.d."
1,pitiful!,Do not get this cd. It is horrible. The only good song on it is Walking on the Sun. Get Astro Lounge instead.
5,Fush Yu Mang...,"Fush Yu Mang has a great array of songs in a bunch of driven styles. I usually consider ""heavy"" music to be boring, but Smash Mouth is the best, with clever lyrics and catchy tunes. The lyric for ""Pet Names"" is great for being amusing, catchy and true. I own all three Smash Mouth albums, they are all different, and I look forward to their next release."
5,i luv their music,i really enjoy their music and i play it on the jukebox no matter where im at cuz i jus plain out LUV SMASHMOUTH!
4,I liked it then,"Before the popular song was on the radio I got this cd and went and watched them and sugar ray before they were anything, if smash mouth kept being a punk band they would rock they sold out hard core but this album minus walking on the sun realy does rock"
1,What a joke!!!,"This has got to be one of the worse albums to come out in the 90's. Only one song, Walking On The Sun, is worth anything, and it's nothing more than a Doors ripoff, and a bad one at that. These guys should just forget about music and try something else. Forget about a sophmore slump...the first one will take care of that. Absolutely pathetic!!!"
3,A strong hit single with an average supporting cast.,"Smashmouth has produced a winner with ""Walking on the Sun."" The other songs on this album are not of the same caliber. The lyrics are hiddeously repetitive. If the band had put as much effort into the rest of the album as they put in their hit single, this would have been a better album."
4,this cd rocks!!!!!!! i love it!!!,"this cd is great. what's not to love about it? can't wait until i get ""Astro Lounge""!!!!"
3,If only Smash Mouth still had a sound like this...,"I really don't care for Smash Mouths new sound. They are probably making more money now from all the pop fans but this is how they should have stayed. Anyway, this is a pretty good album. Its not incredible but its fun to listein to. The songs aren't that deep, but like I said, they are just fun. 'Fu Yu Mang', this album, has a more punkish sound than the sound they have today. Todays fans of Smash Mouth really might not love this. Just about every song on here doesen't sound like 'Walkin On The Sun'. Even if you hate Smash Mouth now, you might want to give this album a try because this is a pretty good album that has sort of a punk rock sound."
5,Woo-Yeah!,"Smashmouths first album. What more needs to be said? Smashmouths first and best C.D. out there, this is highly recommended! The guitars are great, the drums are great the bass is great, hell this album is great! I cannot stress this enough. The lyrics are also very amusing and fit the music perfectly. Now if they would only return to their roots...(I can wish can't I?)"
4,Awsome CD,I got this CD when it firstr came out and I've never gotten sick of the songs. This is a must have for all Smouth Smash fans. Even this CD is sounds nothing like Astro Lounge It is still a good CD with a lot of great songs like Walking on the Sun and Let's Rock
1,expired !!!,"all the chocolate and everything was expired !!this was a gift for my brother, and he did not eat any of it!"
4,A lesson on the value of temporary relationships,I read A Pony for the Winter as a young girl in Junior high (before the words Middle School meant anything) and learned the lessons of temporary relationships thru this book. This is the story that stayed with me for years and I want to thank Helen Kay for her teachings thru her art.
4,dramatic geoengineering,"It doesn't matter where you live on the planet for anywhere man has to battle natural forces to survive. It might be blizzards, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, earthquakes, something will eventually make life difficult. Here John McPhee has selected Flood, volcano, and landslide as the forces of nature and depicted the struggles of Louisiana, Iceland, and LA California.I was mesmorized by the descriptions of red glowing underwater lava flows in Icelandand the precarious cliff edge home-sites in California following massive mud flow disasters.Life seems a little more precarious after reading this but I am also more appreciative of the heroic efforts of so much of humanity thanks to McPhee's writing."
3,Interesting but not outstanding,"I learned a lot.1. In his first story the Atchafalaya river wants to me the new Mississippi and that will cut off New Orleans from the river. The Army Corp of Engineers has been doing all it can for more than half a century but the problem is just getting bigger.2. His second story is about Iceland fighting lava flows, also very interesting.3. His final story is about the fight to control mud and rockslides around LA.All were good subjects for examination however, his writing style jumps around a bit and in some cases it's obvious he didn't have enough material to fill all the pages so he often sidetracked.Overall these are interesting subjects and I learned a lot but his style and lack of depth in investigating some of them made is less than a satisfying read."
4,"Early McPhee...he's better now, but this ain't bad","In Control of Nature McPhee turns his attention to how modern engineers have dealt with the Mississippi, lava flows and LA area rock slides. The topics are compelling and the treatment is thorough.The sole (minor) weakness is McPhee's irritating tendency to use a big word where a little one will do just fine, make the obscure allusion, and use occasional similies that distract rather than illustrate. This problem is not seen in his more recent writing, so he either has seen the error of his ways or gotten a strong editor."
4,relevant to Katrina,"It is worth noting that the first third of this book is highly relevant to the recent Katrina experience. It discusses the manipulation of the Mississippi River system by the Army Corps of Engineers and various interests (oil and shipping). As the book explains, this hubris has resulted in a period of relative stability and attendant econonomic benefits, but has left Southern Louisiana an ecological ""house of cards"" whose condition is rapidly worsening. In the wake of Katrina there has been remarkably little discussion of this history of intervention and the threat it poses for the future. This book is a good place to get the story. But it was first published in 1989, so there's been a lot of water under Old River Control since then.I have only read the first third of this one, but McPhee's books are always crisp, well-written, informative, authoritative, entertaining, and balanced (sometimes to a fault). This one is no exception."
1,unfocused and boring,"I was disappointed after reading this book. The author uses 10,000 words to describe things/man-made structures that could be better described by adding a simple illustration. The writing is not organized in sections/chapters. A lot of unnecessary information is added that renders the book boring and unfocused. It will take me a while to read another book by this author..."
2,Controlling the Lava,"When reading this book for my intro to geology class, I found it to have alot of inpertinent information. For example, in the section to control the lava flow in Iceland, it gave a lot of unnecessary information about the appearance of many of the men on the mission to control the flow of lava. I didn't care to know what the men looked like; I was only interested in the methods they utilized to protect themselves. The information was unnecessary and boring. Also in the section of controlling the Mississippi, they assumed that the reader knew what a dam was or other devices they used to control the water. Since I don't live near any flood plains, it was hard to understand how the devices worked because lack of clear description."
3,Controls are funky but it works well!,"I agree with the other reviewers regarding the controls.It doesn't allow anything to be done easily and you can't change anything during the pre-heat. After pre-heat, the over cooks very evenly and does not burn. The convection works well and is quieter than my old Oster. I would recommend this oven for anyone who can read(instructions). It'll take some getting used to but I think I'll be using it for years."
2,"Very Hot Oven, Had to Return It","The Black & Decker CTO6301 is feature rich. It looks nice. My wife who is blind could operate it. Pretty impressive. EXCEPT IT IS TOO HOT ON THE OUTSIDE!. As other reviewers have said it takes a long time to toast, I guess because it is so large. It is actualy scary to operate, even for a few minutes. I think there is more heat on the outside than the inside. I cannot imagine what baking would be like in it.Anyway we are sending it back. We need to find one with better insulation and no doubt a little smaller so it is a practical toaster. Nice try B&D; but no cigar."
3,Super Sized Toaster !,"It's huge! One obvious negative are tacky buttons, but the performance has been relatively good... still early in the ball game. Our last toaster (not B&D) lasted exactly a year. Hopefully, this lasts longer."
4,Good oven,It works fine but does get HOT. Would be nice to have a means of delayed start so you could set up in morning and have dinner ready when you get home. All necessary trays included nice touch. Even heat and cooking.
3,A,"Everything came as expected on time, Broke after only 1 year of use still under warranty need to get my money back."
2,Sadly doesn't stand the test of time,"Well, I purchased this toaster oven after visiting my in-laws and really liked how it toasted as well as baked. Unfortunately it did not stand the test of time. I purchased this on April 25,2012 it was receivedBlack & Decker CTO6301 Digital Advantage Stainless-Steel 6-Slice Convection Toaster Ovenon the 28th and is now the top heating elements do not work on this day August 7 2012. I'm extremely disappointed and will not purchase another Black and Decker toaster oven. I did try to call B & D customer service and also tried to find replacement parts hoping my husband would repair it. Not luck with either effort."
4,Very Good Convection Toaster Oven,"We have used it to cook pizza, a roast, bacon and toast, of course, so far. We are pleased with the results. It is faster than our regular oven on the items that fit in it. Although I read alot about problems with the exterior getting too hot, we have not found this to be a problem. The controls were a little confusing at first, but once you understand the sequence and with practice, it was fine. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for this type of appliance."
5,kitchen plus,"written reviewBlack & Decker CTO6301 6-Slice Convection Toast-R-Oven, Stainless SteelThis toaster oven is new to us but we have been able to use it for all of our toasting and oven need.Thank you Black & Decker."
1,Toasters that can't start aren't worth much,"This toaster is far and away the worst purchase I have ever made in my entire life. I was terribly excited to have a fancy toaster/convection oven and after pulling out the monstrously huge unit and setting it on my countertop, I discovered that it will not start. I can program everything on the display, but the combined ""Start/Stop"" button seems to only work to stop, rendering the entire appliance a very shiny piece of trash. Worst of all, because I relied on the Black & Decker name, I purchased the oven at a time when I would be unable to use it for a few months, but I assumed returning it wouldn't be necessary and was getting a good deal. In truth, I was getting an awful deal on a completely useless toaster oven. Maybe your toast will actually turn on. I wouldn't suggest taking that kind of risk."
1,unit turns on by itself,unit is horrible. I think i had it for 1 yr. Unit turns on by itself. I tried unplugging it for 1 hr then plugging it in. Unit remains on all the time. The blue light at the top keeps blinking. Very upset over this unit. Looking for a new unit. Might be going towards oyster or proctor silex. Goodbye black and decker
2,Broken in less than 2 weeks.,We got this on Christmas and the unit worked fine initially. We were very pleased. One night it turns on by itself and won't turn off. The top heater always stays on full heat. Since then we have to keep it unplugged. I am currently attempting a refund to buy another brand.
4,toaster oven,LOVe the toaster oven and fits nicely on my countertop. So far it has cooked very evenly and also the convection feature works well!
1,DANGEROUS - FIRE HAZARD,"If you are toasting anything in here you better watch it 100% of the time. We put taco shells into the oven for less than 2 minutes and they caught on fire, nearly burning our cabinets. If we were not right there to put the fire out right away, it would have done severe damage. The same thing nearly happened when we used it to make toast. Since the incident with the taco shells, we have done more research on this oven only to find that many other consumers experienced the same problems - specifically with taco shells and toast. I will be returning this item and hopefully B&D stops making and selling this product."
2,didn't last long,This toaster oven stopped working less than 3 years after I bought it. For the price I was really expecting it to last at least 5 years. I think it just burned out becuase of how HOT the oven would get even with just the toasting setting. I will not be buying black and decker again. Looking for a different brand to buy on my next toaster oven.
2,Short lived,"I had the CTO6301 for around 2 or 3 years. I paid about $75 for it at Bed Bath & Beyond. It seemed to work fairly well for the maybe 3-4 times a week I'd make toast, pizza rolls, heat leftovers, etc. But the other day, it just died. No problem the previous time, no smoke or anything. The buttons no long do anything. There is no display. (I did try other plugs etc, that's not it.) I can't find my receipt or booklet, so I'm just SOL. I am disappointed."
3,"Short lifetime, no repair service available","At first, I loved this little oven, it performed as expected. Unfortunately, it only has a one year warranty and absolutely no Helpful customer service. I search internet reviews and found I was not alone. This product has an average of 16 month lifespan. I used it one afternoon and it just quit. It still looks brand new. It is a shame because this toaster oven seems to be solidly built. It just cost too much to replace every 16 months."
3,"Digital Display extremely hard to read, not backlit","This is my first toaster/convection oven. So far, so good with exception to the digital display. In this day and age with under cupboard lighting, ambient lighting, and other soft lighting in kitchen areas, a digital display that is not lit seems a bit behind the times. No matter where I place the oven in my kitchen, I cannot read the display without using another source of light, like a flashlight. I notice that I am not the only one that has had trouble with this.The oven has received great reviews, I bought it at SamsClub for $59, so I'm keeping it, but the display will always be the thing I hate about it. So for now, the flashlight will do until they make one that has an illuminated display."
1,Too hot!! Too long!,"I Plugged it in and tried a piece of toast with the shade setting of 4. It took a long time, too long. It was extremely hot on the sides front top and back. The cabinet stayed hot for a long time. Too hot to the touch. It definitely would have burned ones fingers.One could not even open and close the door without touching the hot surface of the glass. Bad design.I tried another slice of bread for toast with just a shade setting of one. Still the case was just as hot.I'd be concerned about the power cord coming into contact with the hot surface in the back, melting the insulation, which would allow bare wire to come into contact with the case.I can't believe they put this product on the market. I'm returning it."
4,Quick Analysis,"Good size to almost eliminate the need of your large oven. (For those concerned about space, look up measurements.) Good things; Looks great, heats great, size, convection fan, digital controls. Bad things; top and glass gets ""really hot"", convection only works on ""bake"" function. (And you must remember to turn it on) The user guide states to unplug the unit if your not using it. (Which I do) But if you do that, it clears the memory. (Making the temp / time memory recall useless.) Also, the LCD back ground does not light up and is a bit difficult to see in certain light. Regardless, im happy with it so far.** As far as toasting bread / bagels I think your better off using a regular toaster. While it does toast great, it uses a lot more energy to ""toast"" compared to a regular toaster. I have a regular toaster next to the toaster oven. Its a lot quicker and reduces energy consumption. Also avoids heating the toaster oven up."
1,Worst toaster oven - very disappointing,"I wish I had checked out the reviews before I even bought this. It does get hotter on the outside than any other oven I have owned and would definitely consider it a hazard. The provided accessories (broiling tray, pizza pan, etc.) were very thin, warped right from the box and I can't even imagine trying to clean them. Overall feel (controls, etc.) is very cheap and flimsy - no substance. Found the controls confusing (yes, I did read the manual) and there are rather illogical 'sequences' that must be entered to use certain features. I have had B&D products for years and have always been thrilled with them. I bought this for the capacity, but will now have to think twice before trusting the brand."
1,"Shattered Door, 2 years","I have enjoyed using this convection oven for the price. Although, I don't think the convection worked very well. Pizzas would often come out soft on one side, so we always had to turn them. The controls are supposed to remember the last temp and time input, but it never did.We have owned this for about 2 years and tonight the glass door exploded and shattered all over my kitchen. Luckily, my dogs & I had left the kitchen. I was cooking a potato, no pan or foil, just as I have before. It had only been in about 15 minutes. I am disappointed. If something else would have gone out on it, I would not be as upset. The glass door shattering is a serious safety issue and I am not going to recommend or purchase anything from them again."
1,Black & Decker CT06301 convection oven,"I guess I was fooling myself to think that a small counter top oven could actually be a ""convection"" The convection is just a small fan to ""stir"" up the air inside of the oven. The heating coils are still inside the cooking area and in a small oven like this, they are very close to the food. No matter how I varied the time or temperature, the food would be either to browned or burned both top and botton, before it was cooked. I wish someone would make a small oven that is actually a convection. To call this type oven a convection is like saying that a fake watch which says Rolex on it, is actually a Rolex. It just isn't."
3,Pretty but not the best option,"This is a very nice looking toaster, but I dislike the way the door slams to the counter. The last toaster I had was a cheapy but it had a hinge to stop the door from slamming to the counter and also had a hook to slide out the rack to prevent burning from reaching inside. Back to my $15 toaster!"
5,"Very, very pleased",This is the best darn toaster oven we've ever had. It's roomy and versatile. It heats food incredibly evenly. We are just delighted. It seems to be very well made. Black and Decker have hit a home run with this one.
3,Toaster Needs to Come w/Set of Earplugs,"Bought this toaster after reading good reviews on amazon.com Found it on sale at Target which made it even better. However, when I got it home and set it up I noticed that every time you push a button for the various settings the toaster makes a loud ""beep"". It also makes a loud beep when the timer is finished. Now I don't mind some subtle noises, however the beeping noises that came out of this toaster sounded like a video game...sooooooo loud. It seemed to make good toast, but I just couldn't live with the loud noises that it makes. Read the manual and there doesn't seem to be any adjustments to the volume or on/off of the noise. Seems this would be an ideal toaster for someone who is hard of hearing. Had to return this one."
1,Outside of the unit WAY too hot!,"The oven functions well enough, but the exterior get way too hot. I think it could easily melt anything too close to it. Gotta go back."
1,Died after 14 months,"I had a Black and Decker toaster oven from '92 to '08 and it worked great. When it died, we bought this one as a replacement. It died after 14 months. Looking for the warranty info, I found the one from my first toaster oven, the one that lasted 16 years. It had a 5-year warranty. Well, I thought, if the newer one has the same warranty, I'm fine. Then I found the warranty for this one, and it was only 1 year. So Black & Decker are selling inferior products now with much shorter warranties. I called and they said I was out of luck, since it lasted a whole 60 days past warranty expiration. Then she had the nerve to ask if I'd like to order a replacement. Are you kidding?!?Also, it takes forever, like 7 or 8 minutes, to toast a slice of bread. Find a better product from a manufacturer who actually backs what they sell."
1,This oven is dangerous if the digital controls fail.,"After three or four months of good service, the controls went rogue! The unit would turn itself back on and incinerate any food item inside. It's only safe mode was ""Unplugged"". Don't buy this item without good insurance!"
3,Nice unit but...,"Purchased this yesterday and tried it out. Most everything works fine, but a couple of the preset buttons don't operate properly. When you select a preset item, you are suppose to be able to change the temperature setting provided you do so within the limited time frame. On most of the presets, this works but, on a couple it just does not respond at all. You can, of course do all the settings manually but, you're paying for the preset programming. Since this is a computer or programming glitch, and the unit is computer controlled, it is not an acceptable flaw. Also, as noted, it gets hot on all sides, top and bottom! Be very careful about clearances and childrens reach."
3,Not so hot - wait... it is hot! Ow!,"we bought this puppy to replace a very old B&D straight-up, two-slice, toaster oven. it's very shiny - ooo! Judge Wapner, three o'clock. So i pull it out of the box and the sucker is huge. Now I know i saw it at the store, but it was beside other behemoths, so it didn't look as big as it is. It's 19.5 inches wide and 14 deep. it didn't really fit. none the less, i popped in a couple of pieces of toast and set it for 7 - darkest setting. it burned the thinner piece, but did a good job of toasting the other. took for-ev-er. really. i grew more grey hair just waiting for it. AND - the d*** thing gets really, really, very hot. i burned my little fingers. and all of it gets hot: top, bottom, sides, and especially, the glass door (which should have been a 'duh' but i'm very empirical). so we're returning the beast. <<sigh>> so much for my shiny new toy. Maybe i'll look at jewelry."
2,Too HOT!!,"I just returned this product. I opened the box and turned it on. WOW! The entire outside of this appliance gets WAY TOO HOT!! I didn't even use the oven, the fact that the oven gets so hot was enough for me."
5,Black & Decker CT06301 Digital Advantage Stainless-steel Toaster oven,"I bought this because I was tried of buying toaster ovens with plastic dials. The plastic always breaks and each cost around $45 with shipping and handling. I wanted something that was digital so I didn't have to deal with knobs again. I couldn't be more please with this B & D product. It pre-heats and the adjustments you might want to make to temperature and time are easy to readjust. I haven't used the Convection part yet but I am very happy with heating, roasting, baking and warming. It is well worth the price and is a little larger then you ""traditional"" toaster oven but that even give you more space to roast. I like to roast veggie - it does a great job with a perfect timer. However, if you need to change the timer that is easy to do.Overall, I truly love it and with Free Shipping can't be Beat. I recommend it highly to anyone who doesn't want to fire up the traditional oven and save that electricity!!!Deena11/14/10"
4,Love it,"I was looking to replace a toaster oven which could handle the size of a casserole dish for baking and my daughter had just bought one of these so I got one too. This is wonderful. I bake my mac and cheese in it as it is too hot to turn on a full size oven in the summer. This toaster oven makes good toast and bagels, not too dry and not hard and crunchy like most toaster ovens. I use it every day for everything from toast to baking casseroles. Yes it gets hot on the outside, but almost all GOOD toaster ovens do. I had one that had the plastic on the sides that did not get hot but it was a crappy toaster oven. I really like the way it has a digital thermometer and seems to be more accurate than most toaster ovens."
4,Great Toaster oven,The size of this toaster oven is great. You can fit a nice size frozen pizza in it. It's pretty easy to use and a nice looking appliance on the counter. The only thing I didn't like is the door. You have to hold onto the door when you open it or it just drops down and slams on the counter. I like it better when the door is connected to the shelf and the shelf pulls out when u open the door. Otherwise it's a very nice appliance. Cooks evenly.
4,Newby using an electric convection oven,"Got mine today at BB&B; in the clearance rack:Someone opened the box.I got mine for $55.00 less of course my 20% coupon for $44.00 overall before tax. Was not looking for a convection oven but I thought that it seemed like a good deal.Most reviews concur. And I needed an all around toaster pizza heater top oven.The 1500 watts is good for cooking.Hope the B&D; lives up to the reputation of B&D; products though it seems a bit flimsy, not as solid as the De Longhi I saw, but the brand name and price made it worth the risk.Seems like a decent bargain, read the manual prior to making a chicken leg plus thigh.Overall just what I need."
4,Good,Old but enlighteningIt's requiring me to write a certain number of words to submit this review three two one
4,Discussional,A play that is easy to follow and raises some controversial topics especially of its time. The ending was surprisingly much more emotional than I thought it would be.
3,Ehh...,"So I got this game hoping that it would be just as fun as the arcade, but unfortunately it was not made aware to me that this game only works on XP, go figure. It is a fun game though if you can get it on XP. Anyone else who has the same problem, I suggest getting the free version of Step Mania, it's pretty much a better version of this game that works on all OS's."
1,Did not like it,"It's amazing how something as simple as a flashlight can be poorly designed, but this unit managed. The switch is only on the back cap, which is very cumbersome to operate while holding the flashlight in a normal grip. (Cops have some way they're taught to hold it in a fist.. fine if you're into cop fantasies I guess.) Also the button was sloppy. Also my example came with torn o-rings, badly machined, right out of the box. I sent it back and found another brand I like much better."
5,Its a very good and stuning book...!!!!!,Its a very good book!!!It has alot of detail on the Japanes life in the very old days of the world.Its the best you can get!!!!
2,Okay but not great.,"The benefit of this chair is that it is light. The foot rests are difficult to put on correctly and don't stay hooked when you want them out of the way. We have a front wheel that won't stay tightened. The person in the chair can't wheel themselves unless they use their legs. If you only have one leg, the chair won't roll straight. I would not purchase again."
3,"A good movie, but a bad print.","Its a good movie. Well acted with an excellent cast. The problem is that the print badly needs some form of restoration. The sound is crackly, and at times inaudible, and the print is very dark - even the daylight scenes appear to be at night. I'm a big fan of Edna May Oliver, so am glad to have the movie for her performance alone. One hopes a better quality print will be issued in due course."
3,"Wonderful story, wonderful cast, slightly poor print","This story was a well-written, excellently acted film. Time does not diminish the facts or ideas it puts forward. Anna Neagel and her husband, the director/producer had a reputation for providing good solid work and entertainment. This print was poor in spots, rather dark around the edges. I encountered a couple of transmission problems, however, I cannot lay that completely at the door of the film. We were having severe thunderstorms the entire time it was playing.Despite the quality of the print it is well worth watching. One might think the subject matter a bit melancholy but at the film's end you cannot help but think the moments well spent."
4,"user's friendly, practical effective guidelines",I've adopted this grammar book as well as its two exercise books for my college students of EFL and we are very happy with the results. The text is objective and the explanations quite clear. This is the kind of book that encourages its users to go on with their English studies. The only inconveniences are the cost which is a bit higher than the average for similar books in our country and the lack of further explanations about morphology which I consider crucial for foreign students.
2,Disappointing,"The sound quality of the videotape is pretty poor. The Dodo bird ""host"" is unintelligible. Contrary to the online reviews, the workout itself is too complex for most kids. Some of the moves are fun and easy, like the ""Elephant"" ear flapping, but neither my seven year old nephew nor I could handle the ""Kangaroo"" which looks like Elaine dancing on Seinfeld. We just walked through that part. I'm pretty experienced at aerobics tapes, and I thought most of the moves were intermediate to advanced level. At the beginning they keep changing from move to move way too quickly. OTOH, they do have a responsible warm up and cool down. I may return the video, but I'll wait a few days and ask my nephew again whether he likes it enough to keep it."
1,Physical Education teacher rates this 0,I am an elementary physical education teacher with a dance background. I have taught adult aerobic classes and have choreographed aerobic dances for children. This video is too fast for children. It is hard for an adult. I saw the first dance and could not believe that this was for children 5 and up!
2,Too fast,"I use this with my second-graders, but they don't like it. The instructor goes from step to step too fast, and the kids can't keep up."
2,Not interesting to 9-year-old,I bought this for my 9-year-old who loves animals and work out videos. This one was a combination of too silly and too difficult. Perhaps it would be better for a younger child who is already a dancer.
2,A little bit over my kids head,I loved the video but the moves were very hard and it took them about 2 weeks to finally be able to join in the dances
2,Maybe for the Gifted Dancers Out There,"I was not impressed with this video. Although it is well made the children found it much too difficult and gave up. I have played it for them several times, and they always begin with enthusiasm, but soon lose interest because the dances are much too hard for the little ones (ages 2-6) Maybe this would be a good video for older children, but ""Chicken Fat"" still gets my favorite children's exercise video review."
1,For Professional Dancers Only,"This video claims to be for ages 5 and up, but unless you have a much older child that has been taking dance lessons for years, don't waste your time or money. My 6 year old became dicouraged because it was extremely fast paced and the moves much too difficult to follow."
2,Too hard for a five yr old.,"The moves they did, my five yr could not do and she is usually pretty good at learning how to do things quickly. She was bored within the first 8 minutes of it. The Denise Austin for Kids is much better. She enjoyed that one much more and was able to do the things Denise showed.This dvd Hip Hop was a waste of my money."
2,Arobics For Kids,"This is an arobics video for kids that requires dance skills and coordination. It provides excelent exercise with an animal gimmick. You can do just as well with Richard Simmons, my son and I were not impressed."
2,Difficult to follow,I bought this to help my children 7 and 9 get some exercise when it is too cold to go outside. The video has a long intro and is difficult to follow. It was touch keeping their attention.
2,Too fast for kids,"I havetried using this with my second-graders. Parts of the video are way, way too fast for the most hyper kid. The camera also didn't focus in on the instructor at times when she was switching to a new movement. It may be fun for kids to try home."
5,My kids love this video,"My daughters love this video, especially my 5-year-old. They don't do everything ""perfectly,"" but they have a lot of fun trying.I loaned it to the babysitters at my gym, and they thought it was great it too. They got all 8 kids bouncing around. I appreciated that my daughters were exercising while I was."
4,DVD's for movement,This was a great workout for 2nd grade on up. It was a little too fast for littler children. The outfits are outdated and takes away from the excercise. The older students thought it was cheesy but I found the exercises fun and the students enjoyed them once they stopped laughing at the outfits.
5,Awesome CD,"This is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased. There is not one bad song on this album, they're all rad. They took a terrible George Michael song and turned into an awesome song. If you like KoRn or Deftones you will like Limp Bizkit."
5,The ultimate Oi! album.,"This is the best album the Oi! scene has ever produced and believe me there's alot of competition out there, but no song packs a punch like the rapist."
4,It's better to be dead than F-ing Red!,"This is a classic Oi band. Every one of their records drips with energy, patriotism and violence. A punk rock fan may not appreciate this, but any Oi fan would. You've got to love Combat 84."
2,A Little Big,"I love chess and I'd always hoped to instill that love in my children. Fortunately, they are all fast learners and within an hour they were all doing very well. I decided last Christmas to buy this set for one of my children so that he'd have one that he could carry around with him and possibly begin attending tournaments. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the dimmensions before I ordered it. I didn't realize how large it was. The board is solid with only one fold so the case has to be large enough to hold that and the pieces. The pieces also are huge. It's a good set, it's just a lot larger than I'd thought and that makes it harder for a 9-10 year old to carry it around."
1,"Arrived broken, looks cheap","This item arrived broken -- not surprising, since the bars appear to have been attached with a hot glue gun. Not recommended."
4,Highs and Lows here..,"Tracks 1, 2, 4, 6, are great, solid songs with pleanty of drive behind them- especially Weather Boy which is their most complete and catchy song. (mainly due to the saturation of Look who's perfect now on Australian radio station JJJ) I must disagree with the reviewers comment on Keely's vocals. Having anonymity is a blessing these days, and her sexy, yet common sounding voice complements the electro-pop music nicely. Not a bad effort at all from a newbie three-piece. Well worth a listen in the music store, and decide then for yourself. Much Better than Garbage."
4,Transister,"I have listened to this album repeatedly since I bought it and enjoy the lead track (""Look Who's Happy Now"") the most. Also, ""Crazy Moon"" is a very good song. I think the lead singer is average and the songwriting is spotty, but there are moments. My main question is why Interscope decided to replace the gripping initial video -- about a suicide -- with a forgettable one featuring the vamped up lead in the New York subway. Anyway, a pretty good album."
4,"great spoons, not macine washable","The spoons work great and look great with any wooden mixing bowl. I made the mistake of dishwashing the spoons and they faded significantly after on one wash. The still look nice, just a couple shades lighter than the original stain."
2,very dissapointing,"I bought this cd because I am a fan of Foxy Brown. She only has one solo, ""Somebody Else,"" which is really off putting and not true to her style. All of the songs sound the same also. It was dissapointing because there was so much they could have done with this album. It was just way too hardcore for my taste. It could of done with a lot less cussing, and more original songs. If you like Foxy, Nas, or AZ, then I would buy their solo albums, and forget about this one, unless you like hardcore music"
1,Lack of realism.,"What happened here. Nas and AZ went pretty and lost lyrical energy, Foxy is always wack, and Nature (who is he) This album had no type of charismatic lyrics or production. All this album is talking about is fantasies about illegal drug selling and cristal. If you knew all these drug lords you would not be in the rap game, you would seek asylum. Just plain common sense. The beats by Trackmasters and Dr.Dre are horrible. Dr.Dre could do a lot better than this. I just hope Nas and AZ find the tools necessary to rip up a track like they did in their previous albums. This album is definitely not the album. To all hip hop heads: DO NOT BUY THE ALBUM."
4,Underatted Album,"A lot of people I know downgrade this album for whatever reason. Even album collaborator Dr. Dre himself gave it an unflattering review (On his 2000 song ""Forgot About Dre"", he calls it the ""Firm Flop""). Maybe one reason is that most of the main players (Nas, Dre, and Foxy Brown in particular) have moved on to bigger and better things. But The Firm is far from a flop! Asides from too many pop songs and skits, it's a solid CD. Dr. Dre, who had just left Death Row at the time, produced about half of the tracks (not counting skits). It's a little different from the gangsta Death Row sound that he made famous, but its still hardcore sounding beats. His best beat on the album is probably ""Firm Family"" featuring Dre himself and Nature. ""Phone Tap"" is also a tight track (that was my joint in '97 !). The concept of the album is mostly a Mafia-Flick type vibe (the album cover is borrowed from the movie ""Casino""). I would reccomend this album to anyone."
3,Decent album that didn't really live up to it's expectations,"The Firm album was supposed to be an all-star supergroup album with 3 of the top MCs in the game (Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown) along with one of the top producers in Dr. Dre. It's hard to say where this album fell short but I still think It was a pretty decent album. Not as good as it should've been but still worth buying."
4,forget the other ratings,"forget what you read about cormega being left out, nature deserved to be on this album he is the hardest rapper from queens, if you dont have natures album, For All Seasons, you are truly missing a classic. this album is decent but i would reccomend For All Seasons."
4,could've been much better 3.5 stars,"When I first heard this album I truelly was very dissapointed ,after Nas putted out 2 outstanding cd's(""illmatic"" & ""it was written"")he came out with this. This album starts off great:""the intro"" is made nice,""firm fiasco"" is my personal favorite,""phone tap"" is great(nothing else to say),""executive decision"" has a great beat but it gets annoying after a while, the rest is ... but then they come up with(a way too short)""untouchable"",""5 minutes to flush"" is the good thing about replacing Cormega. ""Desperados"" which includes a perfect performance by Cannibus. The songs that come after desperados are all great. Like i all-ready said this album could be way better. This is the worst album were Nas has been on but it's not that bad. Only the songs between ""executive desicion"" & ""untouchable"" are really bad. If you're a real Nas fan you should buy this album."
2,The worst collabo allbum of all time! (1and 1/2 stars),"To tell you the truth I am surprised that this album is bad(DONT ASK!). But it is bad as these reviewers say it is. Songs that I endorse:FIRM FIASCO, PHONE TAP, FIVE MINUTES TO FLUSH, DESPARADOS(Canibus was the deciding factor), and THROW YOUR GUNS. Filler: Firm Family(crickets chirping), Firm All-Stars(YAAWWWN!) Firm Biz(they literally destroyed their buzz with this song), Hardcore,F*** Somebody Else(Foxy sounds like a real dumb b***h on this song)and the rest of this album. Bottom Line:This album is the reason why most people say nay to Collaboration albums. The production was bland, the lyrics were below average and the fact that this album stained Dr Dre's credibilty says a lot. Question: If Cormega was a part of this group, would it have been a big deal? Answer:No, because even if Cormega is nice that doesnt mean this album is going to be hot. Anybody who says this album is bad is not hating, they are telling the truth."
2,Not Worth The Money,"This CD has a few hot songs, but truthfully, its not worth the money. The songs all sound the same, and I know that Nas can do better that this. It was a real dissapointment when i listened to it. Just a fair warning, Don't Buy This CD, unless you want to waste your hard earned bills."
3,Nas is much better on the solo tip.His new album is killing,"nas is not only the best rapper other then the late BIG but he has a special type of stlye that everyone loves. He's also a positive brother, thats another thing I like about him. When my boo comes out with his new album on the 30th of this month, trust me, your gonna be sucking him too. ONE LOVE."
1,cross genre recomendation,I was supprised to see this come up under this name (the firm). I was unaware of it's existence. I have not listened to this selection so I am not rating it.
2,Firm flop,"This album had to be one of the most disappointing projects of 1997.How bad is this album?Well, after its release AZ apologized for being involved in such a bad project on his album 9 Lives. Producer Dr. Dre is quoted on one of his songs off 2001 calling it ""the Firm flop.""Nas' career almost fizzled into nothing under the Escobar nickname...and it took the brilliant Stillmatic project to resurrect his career.Foxy Brown pretends she was never involved. And Nature...the last minute replacement for Cormega...has also gone nowhere since.Yeah, there are 5 or 6 songs worth a listen (especially Phone Tap and Desparados), but there is more garbage than quality material."
4,Why the Firm at working together,"The firm album was alright, but it could have been a lot better. There wasn't one song where Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature rap together. That's a big weakness in that album. AZ was the reason why the firm album was so good. His rap vocals carried the firm album. AZ told a rap magazine he thought his vocals could been better. But his rap vocals was better than Nas, Nature, and Foxy Brown. Nature rap vocals was really good too. But the main two rappers everyone like, Nas and Foxy Brown didn't rap to their potential. An Foxy was totally out of sink."
2,Yo ! foxy is fire on this Cd,The cd is wack but foxy saves nas and az with her lyrics and beats. My cd player got burned with this but 4 real though the cd is Good I would wouldn't pay higher than 11 dollars for it thou get it cheap
5,"Beautiful, intimate, pieces. Excellent performances.","I have all 3 volumes of Arthur Foote's chamber music on Naxos, and consider all three to be wonderful, but this disc is the best of the three.Foote's music was not groundbreaking, radical or new, but what he did, he did well. The result, classical music that will delight people who want a classical music experience, but might leave a few cold-hearted modernists bored. For the rest of us, from start to finish this is a delightful disc.The performances are imeccable, and the recording is clear. At the bargain price it is an absolute steal."
5,Hope for the Broken and Insight for the Church,This book is a must read if you are struggling with brokenness or if you set clergy abuse policy in the church. The book brings hope and encouragement to people who think God has forgotten them and does not love them. It also gives church leaders a real understanding of the devastation that clergy abuse has on an individual.
3,Good as a rental.,Ok if you are confused about the stars and the title I'll explain. I gave it 3 stars overall cause the game could have been better graphics wise and sound wise (voice acting sounded to cheesy). I gave it 4 stars for fun cause it really was fun trying to get all your body parts back. Which if you have no idea what I'm talking about then you need to pick up the movie Dororo it will explain a bit better. But for those who just want to read the review your father sells you off for power to demons as a child and then you get rebuilt with a new body and weapons and you set off to get your body back. Of course your older when this quest happens though either way it a good rental cause after you get everything back there really is not much else to the game. You can play through as the sidekick but its not much fun and the kid crying just got annoying after the first puzzle mission. Either way its good for a weekend after that there is not much else.
5,It is very easy for the young reader,"The book is very easy to understand, and gives you a lesson onhow to be kind to everybody. The voices on the CD are very clearand the singing and music kept everyone on their toes."
1,Please describe the content!,"UC people,If you are going to reprint a book and offer it for sale on Amazon please have the courtesy to describe the content of the book rather than fatuously describing the process of how it is retrieved from your archives. Does the book have pictures of nestlings? Descriptions of the eggs? ""Our birds"" refers to what area of the globe? The process of hatching? How many species are included? This book is named ""Volume 1"" which implies more volumes - please describe the series. And so forth. I would advise people to avoid buying this book until the sellers are more forthcoming about the contents."
5,Funniest book about the Magic Imaginary Friend Who Lives In The Clouds,"Ms. Bower knows the Bible VERY well, and she is absolutely ruthless in pointing out its millions of contradictions and hypocrisies.What Richard Dawkins (""The God Delusion"") and Christopher Hitchens (""God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything"") did to religion using meticulous research and ultra-sharp minds, Betty does with wit and humor.God is exposed to ridicule and put in its place in a hilarious way.Also recommended: ""Da Gospel According to Ali G""."
2,not very good,this was not A good book. it seemed the onyl thing she was trying to do was make it funny. i'd also like to meet betty because she/he seems very sexist to women. i wouldnt be surprised if betty were actually a man.
2,Gay writer publishes mostly funny book.,"I've read the book and perused the website. I confess to laughing at some of the portrayals as well. Betty is a character created by a gay gentleman by the name of Paul Bradley. The satire is quite good if you are into the standard homosexual tilt on conservative politics.Liberalism may be on the way out, but with George Bush and the Republicans in power, this crossdressing male writing as Betty is really a laugh for you types that like campy homosexual humor."
1,Dislike,"I really dislike this author, but if people want to read what she writes i respect their opinion. I strongly feel that she has no idea what she is writing about and she is just trying to make money."
5,"You've Seen the Website, Now Get the Book!!!","Betty Bowers, America's Best Christian, has finally done it! The wit and wisdom heretofore available only on her website is now available in a tasteful trade paperback.I was especially impressed by her interviews with Laura Bush and the Blessed Virgin Mary (of COURSE not together).Order your copy right now. Don't run the risk of embarrassing yourself by reading it in your local bookstore and snorting your latte out your nose."
5,"""MEN ON BOOKS"" gives it 5 snaps up!","LOVED IT!Betty's book is so scandelous and so right on, both of us at Men on Books -- Anton Merriweather and Blaine Edwards -- give it 5 snaps up, girlfriend!"
5,Such an inspiration to us ladies who aspire to be like her,"Betty Bowers is my idol, even if that means I'm going to Hell. She is such an inspiration to any lady who wants to ""submit gracefully"" to her husband, as the Baptist Conference requires us to do. I would only pray to be one tenth as talented as she in the cookbook I am working on. Betty's recipes are too inspirational to eat afterwards! I think of her day and night, night and day, and beg God to let me be like her. She is more feminine than Martha Stewart. I bet her feminine silver service, feminine crystal, and feminine table linens are magnificent - I am unworthy to blot my lips with her feminine napkins."
1,Disappointed..,The item isn't any better than my integrated wireless adapter.It shows better signals (2 bars -> 3~4 bars) but i can't connect to the internet.What's the use of having many bars if i can't use it.
3,Hawking USB wireless adaptor,"Has great range and was fairly easy to install.It's so wide, it blocks my other USB port, so I have to disconnect it before putting in a jump drive or other device. (Which I then can't use while on-line)The biggest drawback is having to re-enter the password for my router every time I shut the computer off, or often even when it goes to sleep.You would think it should be able to remember the password. And, on top of that you can't paste it into the log-in screen, you have to type each character individually."
1,useless,"I tried this in different PCs and laptops to compare but never seamed to do better then the build in cards. So don't believe this is worth the money. Same, thing with the router; lots of useless word on paper."
1,No lo compren....,"Para el tamaño que tiene la antena y el adapte usb, tiene un alcance pobre ya que es menor al alcance de mi computadora portátil."
1,Not the best,"If you looking for getting better reception signal,not this one. It work same as my wi-fi card that come with my asuss eee 900ha. I wish I can return it."
4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,ITEM PURCHASED FOR LAPTOP. WITH MY BUILT IN NETWORK ADAPTER I GET 1 BAR FOR WIFI. THIS PRODUCT GIVES ME 2 BARS.
2,extremely disappointed,"I purchased this item to try to increase performance on my Toshiba laptop. I have to use it on the fringe of the wireless range. The built-in wireless card connects but is weak and drops frequently. This adapter was not as good as my built-in, and when I connected the recommended external antenna the signal dropped even more. When I contacted the mfgr by email, I was ignored. I am off this company altogether. Next time I will stick with Belkin or Linksys."
1,amazon has no costumer support,it has been over a month since i ordered this product from amazon and i have not yet received it even though it was shipped from the next state over...don't order from amazon!!!
1,terrible product,This is a terrible wireless device does not work half the time or not at all with xp windows
1,did not last even 6 months,I bought this in late October 2009 and it stopped working this week (early Feb. 2010). It worked great while it was operational. It's just a poorly made product that didn't last.
1,Range is lacking,"I bought the Hawking HWUG1 Wireless G USB adapter hoping I could extend the range of my laptop. Sadly, the adapter's range was less than the range of my laptop's built-in wireless functionality. I read the reviews and thought that maybe my laptop had a compromised range already and this would help, heck... it has an antenna on it! How could it be any worse than what I already have built-in?! I even attached an USB extension cord to the adapter to try and move the adapter around (higher, lower, closer to a window, etc.) but it didn't help at all. Every location I tried (at home, friends house and work) failed to match the signal strength of my laptop.Setup was easy and the included software worked fine. Maybe with a more powerful antenna I would have seen an improvement. On its own; however, it's not worth it."
5,Good Product,"This item is accomplishing my intended purpose. Though we have wireless in our home with no problems, there are times when we are on the road and can find wireless service but signal is too weak to use it. This unit seems to double a low bar strength and answer our need. Would recommend the product. Gene in WV"
2,Not worth massive CPU expenditure,"I have a few year old lenovo laptop; from 07 I think. I was pretty surprised at how much CPU this thing used. Granted my comp has never been the greatest at handling intense programs, I could barely do anything while I was using this thing. I'd also thought I'd get more range than I did, though there was some improvement.Pros - Easy install- Improved range of wireless reception for my laptop, though not as much as I expectedCons - Nearly maxed out my CPU anytime I used it, making it impossible to run any remotely intensive program alongside it- It doesn't fit very tightly into the USB slot, which means that the slightest brush or bump against it will disconnect you- I felt the software could have been more user friendly. It was difficult to tell at times which connection my laptop was using, and I still haven't figured out if/how to make the Hawking my default wireless receiver whenever it is plugged in."
2,Offers advantages over similar units,"I bought this pricey item because of the Hawking reputation for quality, but I was very disappointed in the range I was able to achieve. And although I'm also a very experienced computer user, I also found the installation of this device to be very difficult (on two different machines). I had to make at least a half dozen attempts on both machines before I had success in installing the unit. The one positive I like about this device is that the antenna is removable. That means a better external antenna can be connected along with a Booster Amplifier if desired.I personaly would not recommend this type of device if you're looking to extend your range. There are cheaper, better options in USB WiFi adapters, such as the Alfa AWUS036H."
4,fully customizable antenna=better reception,"I bought this adapter after reading reviewsthe area desktop doesn't get good receptionwith other adapter, I only get 2-3 bars, and the rate is so-so (12-24Mbps)but this one made some real differenceeven with stock antenna, I get 3 bars, but the rate is 36-54Mbps!with 6dBi external antenna, I even get 3-4 bars, and it stays 48-54Mbpsbut there's a drawback: it takes long to search my AP (SSID hidden with WPA2 setup), it can take up to 5 minutes to get signaldespite this minor flaw, the fully-customizable antenna gives a potential for better receptionedit: you can enable AP function (real AP mode), search ralink RT2571 driver from ralinktech site"
2,No help at all,"Even with the separate antenna, I had no better signal than with my laptop's integrated wireless card. Disappointing. Will try the DD and report on results."
5,Works with Mac OS X,"This adapter works with Mac OS X, version 10.4, with a driver available from Ralink Technologies. I have tried this on both a Power PC (Powerbook G4) and an Intel machine (Imac). It worked on both.To get the driver, go to ralinktech DOT com, navigate to support, then to Macintosh, and download the driver labelled RT2571...USB. Install the driver package, restart your machine, and then insert the adapter in a USB port. A ""USB wireless utility"" will then start. There is no documentation, but the utility is more or less self-explanatory. If you also have a built in airport card, it probably makes sense to turn off airport before using the adapter, just to be safe.Out of the box, the sensitivity of this adapter seems to be at least as good as that of the built in airport card in my Powerbook. The adapter allows use of an external antenna. I expect that in situations where the built in airport cannot get an adequate signal, this adapter with an additional antenna could do better."
4,Great series set in Big Sky Country,"What a great discover this series was! This volume contains the first two books in the series and I rate Coyote Wind five stars and Specimen Song four stars.The heros name is Gabriel DuPre and he is a descendant of French voyagers and plains Indians called Metis. He is surrounded by a fantastic cast of friends and family that create a wonderful environment surrounding the stories.The author writes sparingly in clear simple language that coveys a great deal of emotion and feeling among the characters in the series. The author says so much with so few words it is astounding. If you like books about real down to earth people, a wonderful, somewhat bleak environment and warm human relationships revolving around a great mystery you should read this series.....Great reading and people you will remember and want as friends."
2,TERRIBLE,I FELL ASLEEP DURING THE MOVIE . NOW I DON'T KNOW THE PLOT. NOT MEMORABLE. I WOULD MOT RECOMMEMD THIS FILM TO ANY ONE
3,The Others,"Acting overall - poor, except for a couple performances - the sheriff, for example. His contribution - fair to good. BUT - the graphics in this thing are awesome. The alien is beautifully realized. A fairly decent plot line but the BB quality acting takes it nowhere. I couldn't connect to any of the characters because of the poor acting. It's obvious it was done on a tiny budget. No special camera angles or unusual shots. It is saved by the aliens...very cool."
1,Acting Kills Mediocre Movie,"I don't expect special effects to be memorable in a low budget flick but this one was killed by the acting. Not one character in the whole movie was believable, endearing, intriguing, or even attractive. This went beyond facial features and expressions to actions -- running and chase scenes were like watching people in casts. Except they weren't in casts, except for that of the movie of course. Perhaps this could have been saved by a great plot, but the plot was weak and depended on good acting to create a sense of eerie tension. That failed completely as the main characters lumbered around like a couple of refugees from Weight Watchers. The only concern created in the viewer was whether they might accidentally run into a wall and knock it over.I don't usually bother reviewing a movie like this but I thought maybe you might find a warning useful."
5,Superb,"This album may be slow at times, but it is in no way boring! Sonicallyinteresting, great songwriting, excellent music."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Short, slow and boring. Haven't played it since the first week I bought it. As ween would say.....Don't sweat it."
1,Andy Breckman's latest is a huge disappointment.,"Anyone wanting more of the humor and creativity of Breckman's first two albums will be disappointed in Death Defying Radio Stunts. Rather than the witty folksongs we've come to love, Breckman pawns off a public radio telethon format, the low point of which occurs when listeners call in and sing 100 bottles of beer on the wall. Breckman and co-host Freeman seem amused but the skit is as tiresome as the real song. The comedy bits go down hill from there."
2,"Ok, but Western romance has been done better...","First of all, I don't know any father who would command his daughter to marry a man who works for him. That said, my eyes rolled too many times to count especially when Travis and Rebecca interacted. Lori was a bit trite in describing their relationsip to the point where the word ""tender"" was overused . Also, I was bothered that she introduced characters from Pine Grove but had no follow through. At least the ending was fathomable. Lucky for Lori, I enjoyed her other books such as any from the Kensington series or the Californians (especially Donovan's Daughter). If anyone wants a good western romance, try Sigmund Brouwer's 'Sam Keaton: Legend of Laramie' books. Frighteningly enough, you can read about another cowboy who pines for a woman named Rebecca. But their romance is complicated and heightened by action and some great humor--all of which spans the length of 4 books."
2,Disappointed.,"Where The Wild Rose Blooms is an excellent book, but this book was very disappointing to me. It dragged on and on. I really didn't like Rebecca at all, she seemed so spoiled. I thought that Travis should just give up on her. I think that it could've been a lot better. I'm starting ""To Know Her By Name."" right now, and so far its good."
2,Disappointing,"I've heard so many wonderful things about Lori Wick's books, and recently read ""Pretense,"" which I thought was very good. It whetted my appetite for more. ""Whispers of Moonlight,"" however, was a disappointment. After a while, the story seemed so circular, and it made for very frustrating reading. The characters were not believable on the whole. With the exception of Rebecca (who was exasperating in her pig-headedness), the characters who experienced changes in their lives seemed to do 180-degree turnarounds instantaneously. It just seemed too good to be true. I am left wondering which of these books is more representative of Lori Wick's writing. I am hesitant to spend the time to find out."
1,Disgusting!,"I love Lori Wick's books and I loved the beginning of this book. Then Rebecca, who obviously didn't love Travis at all, leaves. I was thinking it would only be for a few weeks but she has the twins and stays there for 6 years! Her children become spoiled and she doesn't even think about Travis! I couldn't even finish the book! It was horrible!"
2,Not Wick's best work,"The storyline was entertaining enough, but hardly believable. Wick has much better work than this--don't waste your time on Travis & Rebecca."
2,Not what I expected.,The book was in the right direction of showing how not everyone is alike. We all have our own issues. But the story line wasn't what I thought. It talked about disfunctional home life compared to ticks. Not a very good comparison some of the content could've been wrote differently. My son and I read it together and he wan't very into the story either.
5,"Handel: Concerti Grossi, Op. 3; Sonata a 5","Richard Egarr's first recording with AAM, this first volume of an anticipated Handel cycle is swiftly -- and justifiably -- gathering accolades. Classics Today rated it 10/10, calling the disc a ""terrific release,"" ""superbly engineered and presented [...]. It doesn't get any better."" This month, Gramophone magazine announced it as the 2007 Gramophone Award Winner in the Baroque Instrumental category, proclaiming ""Egarr could not have hoped for a better way to begin his tenure."" I agree. The playing is wonderful, Harmonia Mundi's recording is warm and vibrant, and Egarr's notes for the recording are a interesting and informative. For Handel fans like me, or lovers of Baroque music in general, this disc is a definite ""buy."""
1,VICE IS NO FUN,that's all i have to say. vice only exists now for shock value and contains nothing of it's original wit and satire. the people at vice are sellouts and all the people in montreal know it.BOYCOTT VICE!
3,Ack! False infomation everywhere!,"Now, don't get me wrong, I love all of the clever wit and aggressive writing styles. Who cares if VICE doesn't bother editing for even near-proper grammar?The sex and rock & roll articles are quite readable, though most of the drug information provided is pure urban legend trash.Note: condoning the use of anti-depressants in high quantity for recreational effect has got to be the most reckless advice I've ever read. For the sake of everyone's personal safety, DO NOT TAKE VICE'S DRUG ARTICLES SERIOUSLY!"
5,big joy,"The gift that keeps on giving -- all the best words for this little charmer are Amazon-illegal, but parts seriously make you wonder if you even knew how to kiss right/think sharp before it. Hip without crowding anyone out and funnier than you'd expect. Also, the intro/story of VICE's founding is pretty touching. Get it (on)."
1,Little Black Book = Waste of time and money,"Pay close attention to the word ""Little"" in the title. I own ""Black Books"" for Windows 95 and 98 and have learned all kinds of interesting things about how to make those operating systems work better for me. Apparently the publisher and author of this ""Black Book"", have decided that adding the word ""Little"" to the title means that they can get by with putting ""little"" worthwhile information within the covers. Their total intent seems to be to insult my intelligence. I've only had XP installed on my computer for about eight days, and I already know more about XP than this book teaches. I would say that it might have made a half way decent ""Dummies"" book, but I hate to insult the ""Dummies"" line of books. If you need to know about XP, buy a different book. The only reason I gave this book 1 star, is that Amazon would not let me rate it lower."
1,Little Black Book = Little Black Hole for your $,"One of the most useless books I've seen; If you need the rudimentary information provided in this book, you probably shouldn't be tampering with XP in the first place."
1,Political Ideologies and the Democratic Ideal,"This book is racist. It is written by two white un-cultured men who seem to think it is okay to discriminate against the muslim religion. There is even a chapter called Radical Islam. Really? Christians can be radical too - lets not forget about the Oklahoma City bombing. This book made me sick. It was awful. The authors are not intelligent, and this should have never been published."
3,Its ok,"I picked this up a few days ago, and was a bit undewhelmed by it. While the comp is fun, its a little too eclectic to be a cohesive release. The tracks generally don't seem to flow well(Jewel transitioning into the Bosstones just doesn't work for me) The cd is, however, a gold mine of B-sides, so if your a nerd like me, the one rare track by a favorite band is worth the low cost of the compilation. Strongest track for me was Paddle Out by Sublime. Not rare, but its sticks with me. the weakest track was the abomination of a Beach Boys' song."
3,A little generous.,"I gave this album an extra star for the videos. I thought that was a cool touch. Other than that, with the exception of a few tracks, this album is poor. And Esham knows it.As an Esham fan from '90, Wayne Co, MI, I must say, this is E's weakest effort. Sorry, honesty is what is needed here. A good fan will not encourage an artist to underperform.I still have faith in Esham, and his next album will be good."
2,Horrid,"Let me tell you idiot's something, this cd is bunk. The worst Esham cd.Period. There is not a greater fan than me, but I will keep it real.Someone is making these reviews up, seriously. One, maybe two good songs.Since day one; turbulance; fall into the fire.Thats it."
5,Start here,"for fun and adventure.The Billy and Blaze series is great fun. Young boys, even those not interested in horses, will love these books. My 7yo has never had an interest in horses (he thinks they smell bad) but he hangs on to every word of these adventurous stories."
1,Spoiled by lack of compatibility and by DRM,"The game does not work properly in Windows 7, you will get to a certain point and the game will crash. I have tested this on several different machines. I also tried installing the game on my VMWare XP Pro system. The game has nasty DRM that detects VMWare and will not allow the game to run.The game should include this warning.""Warning, we enjoy victimizing our customers, and spoiling our chances for repeat business; For this reason our lousy software comes with DRM.""I gave these people my hard earned money. Because they ASSUME people will steal their product, now I am being PUNISHED. I am punished by the fact that I have given them my money, and now I have nothing to show for it but a worthless piece of plastic.Thank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it, be sure to rate it as helpful."
2,ANOTHER NON-WORKING AMAZON DOWNLOAD GAME,"WHY do I bother? I wonder if the CD version of the game is as ridden with bugs as THIS game was. It really IS kind of neat but somehow, either Amazon ONLY accepts games for downloads that are bug-ridden OR, they redo it that way in their download shop.The game is horribly buggy and hard. I went straight for the CHEATS...but they only prolonged the agony. I'm probably @ 1/2 through with it and I JUST want it OFF MY PC!AVOID THIS and ANY DOWNLOADABLE GAMES from AMAZON!"
1,"DVD Transfer Quality, Or Lack Thereof","I'm a big Baumbach fan so I thought I'd grab this DVD to put in my collection. Unfortunately it's almost too horrible to watch because of the video transfter quality. The VHS copy isn't like that, I rented it from BB just to see. Anyway, I wouldn't suggest buying this DVD unless you want a horrible ... peice of work."
3,"Bizarre, but quite funny","I'm a big NB fan. THis movie, with it's awful edits, still manages to be entertaining. It isn't nearly as good as his other two films, but still kept me glued to the TV for 75 minutes. The guest shots are fantastic, particularly the Ally Sheedy ones. Christopher Eigeman, my favorite actor, deserved a better part, but Carlos Jacott is terrific. Baumbach himself gives an enjoyable performance. THe movie is all about dialogue and much of it is inspired. If you are new to Noah Baumbach's work, go get Kicking and Screamin and then Mr. Jealousy. This film is really best for fans, and curious viewers. I'm awaiting Noah's next film with great hopes."
4,"Quirky, crazy comedy","Interesting comedy told through the course of three parties in one apartment: a birthday party, a Halloween party, and a New Year's Eve party. Basically centered around the couple who's apartment it is who first are together (birthday), break-up (Halloween), and then are married (New Year's) and all their weird and strange friends they join together for each occasion. For anyone who can remember times like these or are going through times like these, there are plenty of moments to laugh at. Like the boring awkward birthday party magician?! Or the hideously costumed drunk hostess at Halloween?! Or a friend coming out on New Years Eve?! It's all there.....strangely and sadly so. You will recognize so man actors in this I don't know how the director got them all for this nothing of a movie but he did, from Stolz to Sheedy to Bogdanovich and more. You'll have fun guessing who's who, but there's plenty of who's not in the film too. Quirky, strange, but enjoyable."
4,Hoodlum: Music Inspired By The Motion Picture,"I actually bought this to get one song. ""street Life"" R. Patterson- very nice remake."
4,For Hoodlums & Ladies,"This soundtrack is a combination of hip-hop/rap, r&b and jazz for lovers of good material from various artist. A lot of the material found on this soundtrack can be found on these artist's albums. The unknown, Davina, comes with some smooth r&b featuring Raekwon on ""So Good"". Harlem feels like home with Tony Rich's ""Harlem Is Home"" with a deep feeling of love with life. Not only that, it ended the cd perfectly."
4,Great Background effect for a great movie,"The soundtrack for ""Facing the Giants"" was very effective butunobtrusive to the movie. Although the events and outcome inthe movie were predictable , the message and way it was presentedovershaddowed this to make it thoroughly enjoyable. The soundtrackadded greatly to the dramatic effect and made you feel like you weresitting on the 50 yard line. We need more movies like this that buildthe characteracter of our kids."
5,Wonderful teaching aid,"""Facing the Giants"" is a film that I enjoyed watching with my family and I have recommended it to all of my friends. WE purchased the video with the study guide. I teach and coach at a public school and I use segments to help students learn about passion, hardwork, and determination. I have used segments in my sermons at church and I am planning a lesson at our upcoming church family camp.It is wonderful when we can take our young children to the movies to watch a clean movie with a great message."
1,Facing the Giants,"I DID NOT LIKE IT!!!!, I thought I was getting the movie. I hated the music. Did not listen to more then a few minutes when I realized there was no movie. Who would want the sound without the movie????M Green"
5,Excellent service,"Excellent service, fast, clear.Excellent movie also. I recommended for everybody that belives in GOD, or that is crusing a problem and is looking for Him."
5,A Must Have Movie,"This is a movie everyone needs to see. This movie was blessed by God. If you are living through difficult times, see this movie. If you feel that nothing goes right for you, see this movie. If you doubt your abilities, see this movie. You cannot watch this movie and not be touched. Buy this movie. God loves you!"
3,Facing the Giants CD,"I admit to being disapointed with this CD. The movie is really good, but I'm not particularly a fan of merely listening to the music. But, it arrived in good shape. Thank you!"
5,Wolf Brilliance!,"Wow! I don't regret my month's wait of getting this book! I thought the first journal was outstanding, however, this journal blew me away! Such adventure!!!! When I read about the places Claidi went, it was as if I was there. If you read this book you will get into it so quickly that you won't want to finish! The book also makes you want more when you finish, but that's a whole other review!If you aren't a big romantic and love adventure, you would like this book. However, if you love reading about two loved ones who have to be apart from one another this is the book for you as well! Lee, the author made such a brilliant character that I fell in love with the moment I read the first book! Her wit just makes me laugh and wish I could be more like her This journal relates back to the first one so if you haven't read Claidi's first journal you must rush out to a bookstore and get the copy as well as this one! The whole collection of journals are outstanding! Enjoy reading!"
3,"It's good, but not as original as most people are saying.","This book is good, but it isn't all that original. I mean, the whole changing room things has been done a lot. I am not a big ""medieval-fiction"" person, I have to say, I am biased toward Sci-Fi a bit, but I would like to see more non-earthly races as main character. Then it would be more original. Now, for the positives. The book is described fairly well, but it uses a lot of kid words such as ""stuff."" I don't know why, but this bugs me. Other than that, this book is good."
4,this books was okay,it was good but a little slow. i kept having to put it down and skip ahead(shh) bc i got bored at some parts...once i get the third one on paperback i will then read it. i think that one will b better. i hope
2,Not as good,"Wolf Star was definitely a disappointment. After reading the first book, Wolf Tower, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the sequel however i was sadly mistaken. Wolf star was confusing and didn't seem to be going anywhere. And the truth is it didn't! After this abrupt ending I was not intrigued but bored and not eager at all to read the Last of the series, Queen Wolf ."
3,What happened to the great Claidi ?,"What happened to the fun, energetic, exciting Claidi we met in the first one? This second one and the third one are a great mess."
5,coming from an author...,"this book is inspirational. Tanith Lee's style of writing will really captivate your imagination, i think. I am very picky about writing styles, being a author myself, and i will only enjoy the style that is written easiest for the mind to imagine. Every good fantasy book needs basically five things: an intriging writing style, and unruly or loveable character, a romance, and indeniable action. Any book that lacks those five key elements isnt favorable, and almost all of Lee's books are some that i would HIGHLY recommend. And, if you like her style of writing, look up the name Lacie Perry on the little search bar at the top of your screen. Go ahead, do it; You'll be glad you did ;)"
4,Not the best of Claidi...but good!,"I enjoyed this book very much. Although it is not, in my opinion, the best of the Claidi Journals, it is a good read and I definitely recommend it for fantasy lovers! An exciting, intruiging beginning, tho it slows down towards the middle when she gets to the tower. However, things speed up a bit when Claidi finds herself trying to find out Venn's past and, at the same time, wondering if she's falling in love with him. Altogether, its an exclellent book with an interesting plot and, of course, a great heroine!"
2,"No Sympathy, Empathy, or Descriptions","I'm sorry, I just finished reading this book about a week ago after looking for it for a very long time, and I'm frankly disgusted. I can't believe I went through the trials I went through to get this book after reading the first one nearly two years earlier!The plot is unsurprising and dull, and you will not once feel any affection or loathing for the characters or their goals. The characters, plain and simple, are laid out HORRIBLY! I knew how the book was going to end literally HALF WAY THROUGH! Along with horrible literary effort, the cover is also just plain ugly. I truly don't recommend you buy this book, nothing happens. It seems Ms. Lee's series went fully rank after Wolf Tower, the first and much better book in the Claidi Journals series."
5,Very Fine Audio Quality,This is an excellent example of Audio Restoration of late 1920's music. Vaughn has a very sweet voice that is addictive to listen to.
5,Vaughn Deleath has a very sweet soft voice,Vaughn Deleath has a very sweet soft voice. Very nice to listen to. I love this Cd.
3,Pretty Good,Some of the recipes are great and some of them are terrible. I have not found a recipe for the dehydrater that tastes good and wish I never bought one.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I was on a 30-day challenge to eat only raw food. I had hoped that the book would expand my options for raw meals during that time period and expand my options for raw menus after my 30 days were up. I was disappointed. Rather than providing recipes that are good on their own merits, the book tried to mimick cooked dishes with very little success. I'm sorry but chopped veggies wrapped in a cabbage leaf with cold raw tomato sauce on top is not an enchillada. It might actually taste good, I don't know. But calling it an enchillada does not make me want to try it. That said, the strawberry lemonade was fantastic, and some of the other shakes look like they deserve a try.I suppose this book is good for people who plan to go entirely raw for a long period of time and want to try satisfying cravings for things like lasagna and bread."
3,meh...,"fast and furious arena type of combat, huge overkill type of weapons, with good flashy graphics pretty much sums it up for this FPS. kill waves of monsters that unlocks a new weapon/areas in the arena, and then randomly collect pink crystals ""artifacts"" in a certain time limit. these origional ideas sound good on paper but aren't executed well enough to make a solid game out of it."
5,Turntable Stylus,"I bought this to replace the stylus on my Stanton turntable. It's a pretty standard needle that offers decent sound quality. It's not as ""high caliber"" as the more expensive needles available, but for the occasional listener, it does the job adequately and they seem to hold up pretty well."
1,Don't Buy Holmes,"These fans are overpriced, loud pieces of cheap plastic. I had it for one night and chose to sleep with it off rather than put up with the rattling and squeeking. The plastic is so cheap it feels like it's going to break while you put it together. Funny enough, these fans do well because they're more expensive than others - people assume they're the best because they're the most expensive. I highly recommend going for the $40 envirocare fan - it's solid, it's quiet, and it has an air filter built in."
4,Roy and the Pioneers are the Best!,"A great collection! They have one great color episode not to mention the additional 3 episode of the show, which I remember as a kid.What a great price for these hard to find titles, including San Fernando Valley, which was unavailable in other collections. Hope they come up with more of these 3 disc collections."
3,Good but,"I just had a hard time getting into this book. While I felt simpathy for the characters, I didn't really like them. They didn't interest me. The writing was really good but the story itself just made it difficult to finish."
3,Intriguing but not Satisfying,"I liked this book because I found the story to be at once disturbing and intriguing. My main drawback, however, was the characters; all three of the main characters were extremely disappointing and irritating women. By the end of the book I found that I resented their stupidity and lack of intuition rather than sympathized with the extent to which their lives had been destroyed."
3,"Enthralling, but in the end not believable","I fell happily asleep with this book for days. It was entertaining, intelligent, richly written. I liked the characters, who were suitably modern, reflexive, whose identities developed subtley as the book progressed. Yet in the end I found them thinner than I would have liked, and too predictable. The end made sense, but despite the wit, the characters began to disappear in trail of writers' smoke. I began to feel that after all nothing very deep was being said, it was just a cunning use of words. A facade for a hollow philosophy. Good entertainment value, nice to fall asleep with, but it didn't leave its mark."
5,Just the right touch of the mystical.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I thought it had a great balance between reality and fanatasy. I grew to love all of the women in this book. Even the ""bad"" one."
1,The Robber Bride,this is my second book by Margaret Atwood. Just find her work depressing with no value. With so much great literature why spend your time with this book.
1,What a Waste of Time,"I've been a fan of Margaret Atwood's work for many years so I was expecting another good read when I started this book. It's hard to believe this is written by the same author in comparison to some of her earlier novels. SLOW paced, excessive and trivial details, characters that are predictable and just plain boring....I finished this book but only to see if it got any better along the way. It didn't. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Not my favorite Atwood's book but it's ok,". I love Margaret Atwood's book but this one, although interesting enough to be entertaining, fell short in my opinion. Too much symbolism. This is the story of three friends that were wronged by a femme fatale type. I found myself sometimes cheering for the bad girl because the ""heroines"" seemed caught up in a pity party with the whole ""she ruined my life because she stole my man""."
4,honestly feminine,"The best part of the book was the apartment painting idea! I wish I had the cojones to do that to some of my last Landlords. Read the book, great situations, characters everyone can relate to and a satisfactory finish."
3,Not exactly a page-turner,"I was hesitating whether to give this book 2 or 3 stars. It's probably somewhere in between but I gave it the benefit of the doubt due to a few parts of the book that were actually intriguing. The biggest problem with this book is that I didn't care about the main characters. In the very beginning and throughout the entire book, I was always looking for Zenia's motives for hurting these women, but I never found any. Thus it seems weird that Zenia just came around to screw with these women and it makes the story seem insignificant. The book offers a history of each of the three characters Tony, Charis and Roz. Charis' background was the most interesting, but at the same time I was thinking to myself, ""Why do I care about these characters' histories?"". I was always waiting for a big payoff but it never comes, and the ending is a very farfetched disappointment. If you're looking to get in some Atwood, I suggest you read The Handmaid's Tale."
4,Atwood a good novelist.,"This is the first novel I have read by Atwood and it is very impressive. Her characters seem so real and as the reader I really cared about what would happen to them. Tony, Roz and Charis are 3 very diverse and unusual women who become and stay friends in the face of a common adversary. I think one of the appealing things about this novel is that it is easy to identify with the women and what is or has happened in their lives.The only dissatisfaction I had with the book is that some places could have been edited. When the characters have lapsed into memory there are portions that just drag and in other places it's a repeat of what we already know about that particular character.Overall, an excellent read and I recommend it. I think this novel will have a strong appeal for most readers out there."
4,"Beatiful writing, great characterisation","Fantastic writing and exquisite characterisation are combined in this novel about three middle-age friends who recall their experiences with Zenia, a common friend/enemy/she-devil they encountered in different stages of their lives. Tony, Charis and Roz are wonderfully developed, but it's Zenia who is the real star here. I would have loved to read a chapter under her point of view, I'm sure Mrs. Atwood would have been up to the task!!! But perhaps this is the whole point, maybe Zenia was a sort of personification of the three friends' most deepest fears and weaknesses.But still, what shines here is the writing, which puts this book a notch above others with similar soap-operaish plots. This is a high-quality page-turner."
3,A Male Feminist's perspective,"The Robber Bride, the second book I have read by Margaret Atwood, explores the lives of three richly believable characters. The plot is part mystery, part romance, part coming-of-age tale mixed up with a tinge of feminist ideology and a lot of profound observations on North American (specifically, Canadian) life in the mid-late 20th century. I would describe the book as murder mystery meets Holly-go-Lightly meets First Wives' Club. An enchanted vixen comes into and sucks the men out of three women's lives. There's Tony, the female history professor, Charis, the new-age granola, and Roz, the powerhouse exec obsessed with all things material. Although the plot is entertaining, the characters make it work. You'll befriend (or possibly already know) these three women as if they were your personal Golden Girls."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,"Several people have written short synopsis' of this book, so I won't do that. I'll just say, it's been a long time since I've read a book that I couldn't put down -- which was (happily) the case with this book. I'd tell myself ""just one more chapter"" then end up reading until 2:00 AM or later. I loved the characters and the wonderful descriptive passages. There were also several humorous passages or phrases that made me laugh out loud. This was such a memorable books that I was almost sad to finish it because I wanted to find out more about the characters. I find myself recommending this book to all my women friends because I enjoyed it so much. Now I am anxious to read some other books by Margaret Atwood."
4,A different approach to feminist writing,"One of Atwood's best works. Shows that though there is a battle of the sexes, women are equally, or maybe even more, susceptible to harm from other women."
2,Not as good as Margaret Atwood's other books.,"It took me about a month to read this book. I read two other books during the same time. The plot was very dissapointing. I found it very difficult to care about any of the characters. I have read many of Margaret Atwood's books, and this is the first that was a complete let down."
3,Enthralling...until the end,"This book started off with a lot of questions which provided a great need to keep reading. However, once the end was achieved, there were still a lot of questions. Why did Zenia change her room for every visitor? What was the point of Larry's involvement? Did Zenia jump to her death? Zenia's real death at the end was perhaps the most disappointing element of this novel. Although, one redeeming quality was to see how much control she still had on all of the people in her past life... Great read for the summer...Just don't be looking for a book to deeply contemplate...This one will drive you nuts trying to figure out what all of Zenia's motives are..."
3,A bit slow for Margaret,"I am a huge Margaret Atwood fan, first off. This book is slow and subtle, and while I wouldn't say it was great, it does have an appeal. I had a hard time getting through the first few chapters, but Atwood is so good at developing a level of depth to her characters that you become attached to them whether there's much of a plot or not. While it's not one of my favorites by this author, the book has her style, with vivid, delicious use of words to conjure up beautiful, lurid images in your mind while you read."
2,"Mildly entertaining but too predictable, not charming","Mildly entertaining but too predictable, not charming, I skipped through some pages that droned on. There were some very enjoyable segments. This is a book my wife might prefer to read but not enjoy afterwards. Had a common, liberal, anti-male feel to it."
3,"Starts off interesting enough, but doesn't sustain interest.","A good character study, but mid-way through the book,the characters become pretty boring. I only finished itto find ut what happened at the end -and was disappointed with that, also."
1,"Wow, someone please make her stop!","I was a big fan of Margaret Atwood, but after suffering through this atrocity of a novel I feel cheated. I have wasted 4 days of my life reading this unnecessarily loooooong novel. Margaret, are you going through late life crisis? This book is like a cheap soap opera. You used to respect women.Three middle aged women chosen to be victims crying wolf the whole time.Don't waste your time reading this meaningless drivel."
2,Disappointingly anti-climactic,"Being an Atwood fan, I was eager to read The Robber Bride. Novels like The Handmaid's Tale prepared me for rich descriptions and thought-provoking prose. I can't say that this novel disappointed in its plot twists or lush characterizations of its protagonists. However, I do not agree with many of the reviewers who believed that this was a masterpiece. I read to the very last page and felt incredibly disappointed as Zenia turned from masterful seductress and manipulator into an uncontrollable, tactless failure. The uncharacteristic personality shift made the novel less believable. I felt that Atwood was looking for an easy end to this too-long novel and succeeded in making the denouement (and, in my opinion, anti-climax) hasty and unexplained."
4,A good read,"This is ostensibly the story of three women who lose both their men and piece of themselves to a shifting illusion called Zenia. She alternately seduces and dumps the men belonging to Toni, a bespectacled war historian, Charis, a self-doubting but enlightened earth mother, and Roz, an irrepressible business woman and mother of three.As the story unfolds through flashbacks, it becomes apparent that Zenia is not what she seems. This is really the story of how we so often refuse to see the truth about ourselves and our loved ones. Zenia is a mirror held up to each of our heroines (the ordinary kind) to reflect these truths.The characterizations are wonderful. As the reader you get to go on a delicious voyeuristic romp through each of the three women's lives.Overall, an enjoyable read with a good mix of entertainment and thought-provoking material."
3,Results uncertain,"I bought this to reduce the visibility of a few laproscopic incisions and while it was easy to cut the silicone gel pad to size, the edges collect fuzz from your clothes though the pads can be washed. Once I had washed the pads, they never regained the same stickyness they had before but were still usable. Overall, I'm uncertain if they helped much, but they surely didn't hurt."
5,"""Scar be gone""",I was given a recommendation to try this product so I did an do not regret it at all. it works!!
5,Laverne and Shirley,"xcellent tape;fast response; interesting background about the creation of this show, including myths about it."
3,Tough to pick out annoyances...,"I suppose it's pretty tough to write a book about annoyances - since what annoys me may not annoy somebody else. However, I did find a few answers that I didn't already know. The book is definately written for someone between beginner and advanced. A good portion of the ""annoyances"" are things an advanced user would already know (or be able to figure out easy enough) and there isn't enough detail for the beginner.The section on Microsoft Office annoyances (and fixes) was pretty helpful, but you could fill an encyclopedia with things that are annoying in the Office apps - Mac or Windows. The stuff on browsers is ok, but most of it was ""since Safari can't do X, use browser Y"". I was also a bit confused by the discussion of the ""new, free browser Thunderbird"". I suppose you could browse with an email client... =)The annoyances are all over the Mac spectrum - my guess is you'd be lucky to find 20 or so of the 150 annoyances included that might pertain to your situation."
4,"Some annoyances, many tips","Mac Annoyances is full of useful tips. Some really do banish annoying behaviors, such as the Microsoft Office Assistant and Microsoft Word's autocorrect features (and some that are not, in fact, from Microsoft), but others are just useful, such as option-mute-speaker-key bringing up System Preferences and information on how to keep the iTunes library on an external drive. Macs may not be as annoying as PCs, but there are enough non-obvious settings and tricks that a book like this is useful.The book is aimed at an intermediate level, for people who are competent Mac users but who might not feel comfortable figuring out Terminal commands (there are a few, but it's at a cookbook ""cut and paste"" level) or using the Developer Tools.I think it's a good book for intermediate Mac users who want to know some of the hidden tricks that can help make their Mac experience easier."
1,Tiger users beware!,"It wasn't made clear in the listing that this is essentially out of date -- Panther was an interim OS and this book is written from a Panther perspective. Tiger has been with us for more than a year, and the listing for this book should make it clear that this is out of date. A waste of my $$."
3,Not that bad.,"Excellent atmosphere + average writing = 3 stars. Some consider this the worst of the original 58, I disagree. As others have said, there are a few things that aren't very believable, but if you can look past that this is definately worth reading. There is excellent atmosphere, and a geat scene where Frank, Joe & Chet are sneaking into Hexton's castle. 3 Stars."
2,Not as bad as Conventional Thinking,"Most Hardy Boys enthuisiasts will tell you that this was their least favorite book in the series. And that the book is ""disjointed"" in it's writing. I do not quite agree. This is one of the worst in the series, but certainly not ""THE"" worst! I find it a book relatively easy to follow with a decent amount of action to it. The ending I found poorly written. There was a fair amount of interaction with the criminals. RATED C-"
3,The writing could have been tighter...,"On my way to Orlando, I finished up a paperback titled The War In 2020 by Ralph Peters. It's a large paperback (607 pages) that tells a story of armed conflict in the future. Russia is falling apart due to factional fighting internally, and the Islamic and Russian rebel forces are being supplied by the Japanese. The US is no longer the leading world military power, but they don't want to see Russia overrun by Japan. They step in to balance the equation, but end up on the receiving end of a deadly weapon launched by the Japanese. Typical war thriller material.If you're a Tom Clancy fan, you'll probably like it. I'm sort of split on it. While there were some interesting parts, there were characters and subplots that had nothing to do with the main story. He has an explanation for that at the end, but I could have done without half of the book. Also, the book was written in 1991, so some of the scenarios are interesting in light of the last 14 years."
2,Far fetched but fun,"It starts of well with some good characters, interesting technology and fun geopolitics. However, it quickly becomes silly and implausible. A sad follow-up to Red Army."
3,Clancy's Military Clone?,"The story is fast to develop and is extremely easy to read. I find the book to be, well, too optimistic if you believe the hype that this is the equivalent of Orwell's 1984. As a matter of fact, it is not even close to matching the all-time classic. The characters are lame with too many heroic features and not enough flaws. The ending too is kind of lame so be forewarned."
2,"Good premise, awful novel","A good premise and many interesting conclusions about what war will look like then, but ultimately, the story is so hard to believe and to make us believe that it will hang together"
5,Still great after all these years,"Peter's tale of warfare's future--written in 1991--is excellent. In that it is now almost 20 years old, it's worth noting that many of his observations about warfare, and perhaps more noteworthy--society, have come to fruition. The book is also an excellent primer on electronic warfare."
2,Generic Techo-Thriller,"While this book won't win many awards for characterisationor technical believability, it does draw you into a worldwhere Europe is isolationist, the United States is indecline, and Japan is the world superpower, supplyinghi-tech weaponry to favored insurgent forces around theglobe.The heroics of the plague-scarred Colonel Taylor in actionas the last legitimate soldier the U.S. has is interestingenough to pass time and lead you to finish the book."
3,Excellent for camping and sleepovers,"My boys destroy everything they touch, but these spy goggles have survived their destructive ways for at least 2 yrs now and they still use them whenever I let them!!!!"
2,These are crap,These are not worth the money. The battery must be FREQUENTLY replaced and they tint enerything green
2,PPPPHHHHH!!!!!,"It is dumb. I can see better without the green lens thing and the goggles hurt your head. And they say its for ""spying"" lol yah right u can see the lights and it just gives you away."
1,not what I had hoped for,"I purchased this for my youngest grandson. He was excited when he opened them. Things like ""cool"" were said. He and his older brothers went out last night to ""stealth"" in the woods on my property. When he came in he said he couldn't see anything."
2,Heh. Spy Goggles. Heh.,"With these on, you are the complete opposite of a spy, they are so big that you look like a big robotic bug. The headpiece is too small, and the goggles are green. You can't see anything! The battery case is hard to open, and on top of that, the batteries run out really fast! I'd recommend this as a book light or for your kids that are scared of the dark. This is probably one of the Spy Gear company's WORST toys."
3,Kind of redundant,I bought these for my 7 and 11yr. old sons for Christmas last year. They have used them maybe 5 times in the past year. I might as well have duck taped a small flashlight on to a pair of safety glasses.
3,Wheel hub broke,"After using this for a year, the wheel hub/bearing assembly broke so the wheel is wobbling. My guess is that this was caused by one of the wheels being underinflated, putting uneven pressure on the wheel hub while carrying a heavy load. The tires tend to lose air pressure over time. It's too much maintenance for me. Next time I will buy a model with a solid rubber tire. I remember one time I had a dolly that lasted more than 20 years and that one had a solid tire."
2,Milwaukee Hand Truck,Good for light duty action only. Not nearly as good as a Magliner. The cost is very reasonable though. You get what you pay for.
3,Looks great..but bewarned..,"The sticker looks awesome, but it is hard to install you must be careful. And after installation it is easily peeled off from friction. I would recommend spraying a clear coat over to prevent this."
3,Not what i was expecting,"I had the urge to play some classic games and purchased this thinking that it would be a collection of original arcade classics, however on playing the games on the disc, they are remastered versions of the originals. Some are good remakes, outrun being particularly impressive but far too east. Space Harrier also has done well from the face lift and Alien Syndrome. However the others are not great by any means i have to agree with one reviewer that Golden Axe is Awful! Bonanza Brothers is ok. The only real original looking and feeling game was the VR racing which bought back some childhood memories. This collection is not that bad and at $20 it isnt ripping you off..but you can go to target and they are selling them for $9.99, at that price it qould be a bargin.Look at other classic hit titles before buying this one!"
1,what a let down,"i was hoping for a classics compilation.when i didnt see zaxxon,super zaxxon or pengo,i was already dissapointed.i bought the game anyways.will someone please tell sega to put the above mentioned games in a future disc."
5,Its Great. Fit Canon HF200,Works as expected. Let's me put my Nikon filters on a CAnon HF 200. Good quality aluminum construction.
5,jaw dropping,"another astonishing album.....and this is a collection of songs left off of earlier albumss???.........frankly with Ron you are safe to buy any of his albums and you get a record full of classics..............no duff stuff. I am 50+ and been listening to songwriters all my life. I never expected such an eyeopening talent to come so late into my life, I only recently discovered Ron with his 2010 album Long Player, Late Bloomer........... I am amazed by this mans songs and have since bought all of his back catalogue and have listened to nothing else for the last 8 months"
2,A disappointment,"I first learned of Ron Sexsmith reading a newspaper article about today's lesser known singer/songwriters. I subsequently found this disc on a discount rack and bought it, without ever having heard any of Sexsmith's music.This mellow disc is full of simple songs with simple melodies. Many of the songs consist of Sexsmith's rather bland vocals over sparse background instruments. The songs are short, but with 14 of them, the disc seems very long. The songs, in my opinion, seem to run together to the point that they all start sounding the same. Individually, some of the songs are charming, but collectively, they don't do much for me.This is the kind of disc would be great if it's included in a 5-CD player on the ""random play"" function, allowing you to hear one or two songs off this CD before mixing in songs from other discs. As an entire album, however, I would prefer a wider variety of songs, as well as a more expressive and emotive vocalist."
2,Mary and Joseph,"Poor acting, and not accurate. It was watching actors and actresses using today's actionsin ancient setting , really?Do you believe that Mary and Joseph really behaved in these embraces as they do in today's times. It was entertaining Everything just seemed seemed too modern"
3,Duplicated patterns,"I was looking forward to this book so much, but I was vastly disappointed. At least half of the patterns in this book are reprinted from other Vogue Knitting books that I already own. I give it three stars because I am upset that I spent the money on this book and nowhere does it state that these are not new designs and have been reprinted from their other books. However, if you do not own any of the other books and you are only interested in accessories then you will probably enjoy this book."
5,Swingin' Bobby Darin,"Another compilation of Bobby Darin. Bobby Darin is one of the greatest artists in pop music. He started as a rock 'n' roll artist (Splih Splash, Dream Lover,...) and composer in late fifties of previous century than turned into swing music. He inspired a lot of singers, Brian Setzer (he recorded As Long As I'm Singin', A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square, Mack The Knife), Dion (to name just a few). And everything he did is great.His first swing hit was Mack the Knife (from Threepeny opera, is here featured live) that became a number one hit. Beyond the Sea is one of my favourite swing songs and it is here featured live also. The orchestra that is backing him is really great and Bobby Darin is a wonderful singer.On this record you will find mostly swing songs and some folk songs (If I Were a Carpenter, 18 Yellow Roses,...)that he recorded for Capitol.Sound is rich and songs are great. A must for every swing fan."
3,"Not definitive, but Darin nonetheless","Why won't they ever put all of Darin's great songs on one CD? This grouping seems strange (two versions of ""Beyond The Sea,"" both live, both with the same ""Tommy Sands"" joke), with lots of songs associated with others (do we really need Bobby's cover of Moon River?). ""Artificial Flowers"" is only included as a brief bit in a live medley -- and no ""Simple Song of Freedom"" at all.Still, it's nice to hear the real Darin again -- and thanks to Kevin Spacey, more people are."
2,Kind of disappointed,"This is tabbed the ""Legendary"" Bobby Darin, but it doesn't live up to such a lofty title. I must say that I bought this for a couple of his classic songs, especially Mack the Knife.I should have paid more attention to the track listing because some of the more-known songs are Live versions in which he half-sings them, half-talks to the crowd. So if you're looking for the original versions of the songs, please look elsewhere.That said, it is interesting to hear Darin in a sort of Vegas-lounge act setting. It gives you a definite feeling of the 60's rat-pack-era.Overall though, I don't think it's worth the price and therefore I feel a tiny bit disappointed. It's not bad, but it's definitely not what I was hoping for. It won't make it into heavy rotation in my cd collection. Two stars."
2,Crappy live versions of Beyond the Sea & others,"I was really disappointed to see that I wasn't getting the real version of Beyond the Sea & some others. Lot's of other good stuff but, for me, that was what I was really after. Get a collection that has the real versions of the Darin's songs."
3,Just a Memory,"The CD brought back memories. We saw Bobby perform at Lake Tahoe long ago, so I'll play it when I feel nostalgic."
5,Best mystery series I have ever read.,"I bought the whole series when I found that my favorite author, Nora Roberts, was also writing under the name of JD Robb. How disappointing to find that when I finished my last book, the new one isn't published yet. The books certainly lived up to my expectations. I would recommend this series to anyone who loves romance and some mystery."
5,I enjoyed this story,I enjoyed this story by J D Robb and it was very entertaining and had a lot of my favorite characters included in the story.
4,Another great J.D. Robb read,Nora Roberts has a great ongoing series with Eve Dallas-a tough futuristic cop married to one of the world's richest and most intriguing men - Roarke. The great thing about this series is the availability of the writer to add new and intersting characters while expanding the relationships of those characters already in place. These books continue to keep a reader enthralled with the twists and turns of the plots and the ever developing relationship between Eve and Roarke. A great read.
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,I have gotten my hands on the whole series. What a way Ms. Robb has for getting and keeping your attention. Even at the end of the series I wanted to read more.
3,Kindle version typos detract from the story,"It's just sloppy. Here I am, reading these in order, so happy to have a Kindle because it only takes 2 days to get through each story. (How much time would that take in trips to the library??)Love the series, love the characters, love the author. Ok, I haven't read all that much of her stuff.Hard copy - fine.(free) eBook from some unknown maker that played on my Palm Treo - fine.Kindle version for $7.00 - MAJOR TYPOS. They're irritating. They're distracting. They're totally avoidable.PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT GUYS! You're needlessly ruining the experience.The story is true to form, good fun fluff. Can't really go wrong there when you're just looking to waste some time."
5,"A perfect combination of mystery, suspense, and romance!!!!!","The story line is involved, developed beautifully, and is well written. Roarke and Eve's respective characters, along with Peabody and McNab's, shows and grows more and more as the series evolves. I wish that J.D.Robb wrote more books in this series and that the local library carried more of this series. Maybe she should publish them in hardback as well to make it easier to gain access to the book. I LOVE ALL OF THE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"4.5 stars, Very good story","4.5 stars.I really enjoyed this book of the series because I like dark themes. It's not focused very much on the investigation. I liked that its focus is on Eve's trust issues and the fact that in the story she seems to be ""betrayed"" by people she trusts. Eve takes her job very seriously and she has to make decisions that are very hard. People around Eve reason differently, they let their emotions lead their lives, but Eve's very different. She struggles to let people know that she cares, that she's trying to protect them, but her behavior is misunderstood.Roarke is her sanctuary and Eve is his only weakness. What a man! They are my favorite couple.I wasn't really satisfied with the ending of the investigation. I think it was a little bit rushed, there were a few aspects of the story that I think were abandoned, therefore it's 4.5 stars for me. On to the next!"
4,Ceremony in Death,"A good mystery in the future. In the near future that is beleiveable, not way out. Eve Dallas keeps you on your toes & her husband keeps her on her toes.A fun read."
2,CDs were scratched,"The book is wonderful but 3 of the CDs were scratched. The scratches are not deep enough to be a problem right now; hopefully, they won't be a problem in the future. The 3 scratches look like they were made by the same production problem...located in the same place on the CD and about the same size and shape.Of course, JD Robb is one of my favorite authors and I'm trying to go back and read all that she has written with Eve Dallas and Rourke."
1,"Time to Kill the ""in Death"" series","This series quickly became childish, repetitive, over priced and boring. I did enjoy seeing books of this series, including this one, in the ""any book for $4"" bin at a big box grocery store. I'd pass, even if they were free."
2,Eve is too arrogant for me to like....,I was really upset over the way Eve treated Peabody when she questioned her interview techique. It was an example of the worst type of leader. She humiliated Peabody in her arrogance. Nowhere in the story did she reflect upon why she had to demean Peabody. It showed a real flaw in her character I am not sure I can forgive. Robb had Peabody groovel to Eve and Eve take it as her due. I will read one more to see if I can like and find sympathy for Eve again but right now I am disgusted by her.
1,ceremony in death,I don't care for that kind of book. Witches are not my thing. I felt like she was stretching to have something to write about and it was not like any other of her books I had read.
3,Least favorite. Too predictable,My least favorite book so far. It was far too mystical for my tastes. I'm growing weary of the the over steamy bedroom scenes. It's time to get real. It was solved and ended too abruptly.
5,Robb Rocks,"JD Robb does her usual fine job of putting the reader in New York of the future, with her kick ass Eve Dallas. I can read about Lt. Dallas all day."
4,Wonderful Show,"I am watching the first season. I sure wish we could get more seasons. The acting is great and the plots believable.Apparantely, this is all we can get in the US."
3,DVD good,"Benny Greb is the most excellent drummer.The Hudson is forgetting the other drummers.Example: Tommy Igoe, Bobby Jarzombek, JR Tony Royster, Michael Djordjevic, Mike Terrana, Smith Marvin ""Smitty""...A great drummer is John Riley. Just wanted to see other drummers participate again, an example is Virgil Donati who participated in 1997. I found a little tiring to see ""Shawn Pelton"" present themselves once again. I think another drummer would be more interesting, Michael Djordjevic who never participated.It's just an opinion, I am peace."
4,"Surprise, surprise! A new find","Boris Akunin's ""Winter Queen"" is a delightful surprise - elegant, funny, gripping, historically of interest and full of surprises. The translation is excellent, the language lively and colourful. The theme of a lucky detective - young, resourceful and promising - also promises many more adventures. Let's hope they'll be translated a.s.a.p., I can hardly wait."
3,Starts well ...,"After an arresting start, and a nice conceit -- a Tsarist policeman as the good guy -- this devolves into what used to be called a 'penny dreadful'. This could have been written by Edgar Wallce or Leslie Charteris. Secret societies and non-descript writing. A disappointment."
1,Poor Start...,"Either the translation went awry or there is something rotten in the plot; either way it is a shockingly amateurish start and might even put off readers' from buying other books of the series. To start with, Erast doesn't stutter; many characters are let off in the middle without any explanation; characters' appear out of blue with outlandish names; it is never explained why the main villain did what he/she did - if there is a metaphorical reference to it, I don't think I would want to re-visit the book again. Various eulogies praising the book to the sky from the likes of Ruth Rendell are but a sham to hook a naive reader to buy this boring book...Unacceptable...."
2,Slow moving. Dull.,Disappointed that this story didn't give me an image of the culture in Russia. This story could have been is Spain or US or any European country. The mystery was slow moving - it took me 6 weeks to finish. It was easy to put down and not pick up for a week.
4,Enjoyable,"This is an enjoyable novel to read, with a russian flare. Don't expect an intricate mystery, it is more of an adventure novel. Fandorin is a likeable lead character. I particularly liked how Akunin made him fallible, making mistakes along the way. It gets a bit over the top, especially the last couple of chapters."
3,Likeable protagonist,"OK Fandorin's a bit simple, and he seems to lack Sherlock Holmes' intelligence and deductive reasoning - Fandorin kind of just pulls the solutions out of thin air. But the guy's likeable, and most of the words and writing are lovely. I would have given the book 4 stars, but the flow of the translation or the writing itself was choppy IMO. I kept going back a paragraph or two to reread what just happened.If you want happy endings, you may be disappointed. Still a thumbs up. I will pick up the next book and continue the series for now."
4,excellent detective mystery,The author had me guessing till the very end.The book is filled with various strange characters and twists and turns - taking the reader on an enjoyable and interesting adventure through late 19th century Russia.
1,Worst Book I Have Read in Many Years,"This book was listed in the New York Times Book Review Section as an ""editors' choice,"" which was why I picked it up. The hero, Fandorin, was so remarkably dim-witted, the book became increasingly annoying as it plodded along. How a series could ever be written around such a foolish person amazes me. The plot was replete with gaps that never seemed to get filled, and the ending was shockingly bad, as if the author just got tired of the story."
4,Breathtaking Twists and Turns,"THE WINTER QUEEN is an interesting journey into Czarist Russia. Well written and almost lyrical at times, with a great sense of humor and adventure.Erast Fandorin follows the breathtaking twists and turns of his investigation...Highly recommended. Like a Russian James Bond. This book is elaborate, intricate, profoundly Czarist, and Russian to its bones. It is almost as if Tolstoy sat down to write a murder mystery. A strange and appealing novel, and not quite like anything you've ever read before. The book is as international as caviar and vodka.Definitely makes me want to read others in this series."
2,Lost potential ...,"I recently found out about Akunin's novels, and started with The Winter Queen. The first few pages of the story grabbed my interest, but then it started falling apart and became more and more unbelievable. Our hero is young (19), inexperienced, and yet finds himself assigned to investigate a top crime and travel internationally. He has so many brushes with death, about the only thing that didn't happen was tying him to the rainroad tracks like Nell in a Dudley Do-Right cartoon. I'm sorry it dissolved into such dreck. The beginning was really promising, but it soon became a plodding affair which I ended up sort of skimming through to the bloody (and gratuitous) end. Bah. No more Akunin for me."
3,The Flame of a Series Extinguished?,"To the significant detriment of The Winter Queen, it's narrative is excessively reliant upon dialogue to set the ship of story to sail; it tells rather than shows. Of additional concern, perhaps my primary difficulty with the work, was the lack of a compelling character at the center of the novel; Erast Fandorin is simply not that interesting a protagonist. Fandorin doesn't arrive at his conclusions through his fierce powers of deduction, so much as he stumbles over them by accident, or after being manipulated into a situation of peril. Based on the all-too predicatable conclusion, there is the potential for Boris Akunin to invest his creation with greater depth in future novels, but at present, pessimism about his powers rule the day."
2,"Some good points, but ultimately disappointing","First the good points. The language was beatiful; the story moved briskly, with old fashioned cliffhanging chapters; Fandorin is an engaging character. Unfortunately, the basic plot is frankly silly, and for me spoiled the enjoyment of the book's good elements. The ending seemed especially gratuitous.I decided on this basis not to read the rest of the series, though I note one reviewer tells those put off to stick with the series--perhaps the plots get stronger. Certainly the era offered plenty of basis for more realistic plots."
4,Excellant debut of a series...,"Akunin's ""Winter Queen"" is a wonderful addition to the mystery genre. We meet Erast Fandorin in 1876 Moscow, as he attempts to solve a mysterious suicide. Soon, while he is investigating, a murder is committed, and Erast knows he is on to something. Frankly, Erast is quite lucky here, as fate prevents him from dying at least three times. That is why this book is only 4 stars instead of five. Good background on ""Russian"" roulette, and on the moody fatalism of Russians. I really liked how the conspiracy was found, and its purpose. The book should have kept its ""Azazel"" title for America, as it is much more relevant to the story. Count Hippolyte is an intriguing sidekick type, and I hope to see him again in an another Fandorin novel. Great shocker of an ending. Goes out literally in a bang."
5,Azazel,"I agree with Kizelyova. I would add that this book and its follow-ups are wonderful period pieces, but with a lot of humor and irony. From what I have heard, Russians find parallels to current events in the stories.I haven't read the English edition, so I can't say if the tongue-in-cheek has been preserved. From my own experience, I read quite a few pages saying, ""no, this is not possible, he has got to be kidding"". Finally as a dunce, I realized he really was kidding.But why did the English publisher give it this ridiculous title? it would have been better to call it ""Azazel"", which has meaning in the book.Maybe some publisher--even this one--will have the good sense to translate the French writer, Jean-Francois Parot. Parot's hero, Nicolas Le Floch, reminds me a lot of Eraste Fandorine. But Le Floch is situated in the time of Louis XV in Paris.As for Akunin, I hope that the Turkish Gambit and the Death of Achilles come out soon. They are far better than Leviathan."
1,"So outdated, this book is completely worthless","Not only is the information in the book unhelpful, it is now completely useless. None of the places I went to existed anymore as this book hasn't been redone since 1995!"
1,Utter crap!,"Do not buy this CD. The Hawkwind songs on here are poorly performed live versions that were even more poorly recorded. The only good songs on here are both by Amon Duul with Robert Calvert, and they are both available on Amon Duul's ""Die Lusong"" album. Go buy ""Die Lusong"" and forget you ever heard about this shoddy anthology."
4,The drum & bass brainwash; it's not so bad.,"I have been (and still am) a huge fan of drum & bass. And I think other fans will agree with me when I say that the genre's biggest drawback is, well, the beat. It can sometimes sound terribly ubiquitous. No matter. Plug's ""freaky"" rythms and programming truly make him ""master of all."" The samples are well-placed and some of the sequences are, to be blunt, plain fun. It may sound like everything else at first listen (a friend of mine rolled his eyes, saying, ""oh, not this drum & bass thing again."" when I had it on the stereo), but let it break that protective membrane that stops you from stopping and reconsidering, ultimately turning you into your parents, and let Plug insert about 80 or more snare hits per minute into your conscious mind."
5,A Masterpiece with only a few flaws(due to age),"It really should be a staple in any D n' B collection. He makes guys like Roni Size look like child's play, although he has a place in my CD collection as well :)The sampling is at times hilarious and his production is very full and lush. Sometimes it does sound a little dated and the looping becomes a little obvious and repetitive, but I'd say that only happens 1 out of 5 or 6 songs... and it doesn't keep up like that for long. But the songs that are good(and there are alot), are amazing. and you can definitely see how Aphex Twin was influenced by this. Every once in a while it will break down into an all out Drill n' base Solo!An amazing release and full of all sorts quirks and lovely humor. my advice is to be sure to listen to the CD's all the way thru like, it's so much better that way. And your getting 2 CDs for the price of one!If your into D n' B, Luke Vibert(in general), or any of his Warp/Rephlex buddies, I highly recommend this."
5,The Cornfed kid likes it!!!,"I bought this album when it was first released in my younger days. I grew up in the mid-west(kansas). I remember going to the mall and asking the store person if they had any drum&bass music. He simply replied ""you mean like African?"". Needless to say somehow I found this album and fell in love with it. It was my first intro to this type of electro-music. I still consider it a classic music album full of variety and textures that any ""music lover with a beat""would appreciate. Give it a try I belive it's worth it!"
2,A notch above mediocre,"If you're looking for melody, look elsewhere. d'n'b also needs that element to make an excellent recording. This double album failed in many of its tracks. The only reason why I'm giving it 2/5 is because of a couple of good songs on there: ""Feelings"" and ""Military Jazz."""
5,A classic of drum n' bass.....,"It's funny how much consensus their typically is in the drum n' bass community regarding what are/are not classic albums. Although normally subsumed into the second rank of performers by many (i.e. behind Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Amon Tobin, etc.) Luke Vibert (Plug, Wagon Christ) on this book puts together an album of uncommon ability that has managed to stay both current and, well, brilliant over a couple of years.....This is not dance music. If you generally have liked the d n'b / jungle/house stuff that can almost be danced to (Goldie and Roni Size come to mind) this is going to be a disappointment: it's a heady, minimalist album that relies on the listener pretty much just sitting and focusing. It's a brilliant album, though. If someone likes Photek's old stuff or Amon Tobin or even some of the other more jazzy Ninja Tune stuff (Cinematic Orchestra) this probably is a worthwhile buy....."
3,Not as much fun nowdays,"My husband bought this because it was his favorite CD when he was a teenager, running around and partying with his friends. Now that he's older, he can't remember why he thought it was so cool."
1,NICE BEATS,"These CDs are impressive at first. Then you realize how monotonous the tracks are. Then you realize there is no real content here, and the melodies suck....Photek and WE are so much better at making well rounded tracks."
5,Better reception antenna for Garmin,Accessory antenna attached to windshield by suction cups is out of sight (except for the wire) behind the rearview mirror and increases the signal strength to my Garmin 60cs handheld GPS. Allows the handheld to be held under the metal roof for a closer look and handed to others in the vehicle without loosing the satellite signal. I'm very pleased.
4,Easy to Remember/Easy to Play?,"This Peplowski album finds the clarinet great in a very mellow mood, playing mostly ballads, slow to medium tempi, great numbers, deep full clarion call, but, unhappily, generating relatively little of his fabled improvisational excitement. His excellent band accompanies him discretely as Peps summons forth his round, deep tone and vibrato lilt. Nice! but keep one of his hot recordings at hand should you feel the need of it."
2,Gets old quick,"When I first heard 30footFALL I thought they were one of the most awesome bands around, but after listening to the album for a considerable amount of time the songs begin to all sound exactly the same. After that happened I recognized that these guys aren't that talented or original either."
3,Buy it after you've bought other ones,"I understand why some people think this album gets old after a while, it does. But it's consistent with their style. They never changed, they only got better. You can hear it easily on other albums. I like this one though, it's a cool one to have."
3,not as good as their other CD.,"Well, fine, it is close to 30 foot fall's other, but not as good. Mainly because it restricts itself to such a limited number of songs. What's amazing about 30FF is that their music sounds the same on their CD as it does live. This kind of gives the whole track a specific raw feeling. On the negetive, it also shows that they arent too picky about their music, and the CD exposes a lack of attention to somewhat major/minor details. Dancing With Myself was a very original take of Billy Idol's greatest/only hit, and is probably the only track that anyone could stand listenning to over and over and over, as one should expect from owning a CD. I liked it, but I wouldnt pay more than 10 dollars for it, considering it sounds like they only spent a quarter putting it together."
3,Rugby Writer with Room to Grow,"As a rugby player and writer myself, I bought this book hoping someone had at last put into words the magnificant, life changing experience rugby can be for a woman. Ms. Schmidt is able to capture these feelings at some points through the novel, but I found myself skimming through the technical explanations dominating the first portion of the book. I think readers, non-rugby savvy folks included, would like to see more of Rose herself and hear more of her thoughts on her journey as she relates rugby to life.Portions of the book are quite well written, particularly the summary of the first official international women's match and the scandal it caused. I also related very well to her discussion on playing injured. Other technical, rule related portions of the book could perhaps have served as appendix material to what is, in essence, a love song to rugby."
2,hmmm.....,"I don't know whether the following people that gave this scope 5 stars were paid by Celestron or not...all I know is that I gave this scope to my father for Christmas knowing that he has wanted one for years. From what I gathered, it was going to be a great scope for a beginner and you can grow from there and blah, blah, blah. All in all, don't buy this scope. Save up and buy a nicer scope that does not shake as much. Maybe it is just because we are beginners...so correct me if I am wrong and forgive me for being frustrated...but it seems impossible to locate anything legit other than the moon. The moon is amazing to look at, but please, we want more. ;)If we master anything, and my opinion has changed with in the next couple of months, I shall post a different opinion, but until then folks I am sad to say that this was a waist of money...but even more so a waist of anticipation and excitement."
4,good for price,Many of the reviews say that the mount is shakey. Understand for the price there will be limitations. Also 675x in unrealistic in most scopes. My boys still haven't opened it so my evaluation is not completely accurate. Remember not to use this scope about about 150x. That's about as high power as you can practically get. Also for looking at stars you don't want high power. They are just points and higher power reduces light gathering. I might suggest if you want to reduce the vibration see if you can upgrade with a pedestal mount. Still for the price a 114 mm reflector with an equatorial mount is pretty good.
5,so cool,really good gift and pretty good for first timers couldnt stop looking in it all nite could see a lot
5,An excellent beginning scope.,"I received this telescope for Christmas and I must say after waiting two nights to use it I am impressed. My first target was M42 Orion's Nebula and the K20 eyepiece gave me a mesmerizing view of this amazing stellar nursery. The mount does have some shakiness to it but, it's nothing that can't be overlooked. I have the updated scope so it came with a metal focuser which is a big plus. The 3x Barlow is okay with the 20 but is useless with the 4 as is the 4mm eyepiece itself. If you are thinking of getting a more expensive scope of this size I recommend getting this and buying a 25mm Plossl eyepiece and a 2x Barlow and possibly a 7.5mm eyepiece (planetary and moon viewing) for the extra money you would spend on a more expensive scope."
1,"Seller 'Anacortes Telescope' - Mailed to wrong address, They Don't Care!","Amazon has documentation that the seller mailed to wrong address, yet the seller says ""to bad so sad"". Now I'm stuck with a telescope instead of the intended person."
5,Spectra Radiator,Perfect replacement part for stock radiator. All aluminum is in some ways even better than stock. Packing was excellent to prevent any damage to unit. Perfect fit and car now runs cool. Took 1 1/2 hours to fit and I saved $300 on a shop quote to supply and fit a radiator
5,Monkey,"This item arrived quickly, and was in perfect condition. The shipment packaging was super. The toy itself was as expected, and appreciated by the recipient."
5,Fabulously timeless!,"I'm not usually a big fan of war stories that are mostly based in combat, but this was definitely the exception. I guess it's partly because of Mailer's incredible descriptive style, and partly because the combat is woven in with the characters' thoughts and flashbacks. I'm seriously at a loss as how to fully describe this book. If you haven't read it, I totally recommend you at least look into this."
1,A very over-rated and pretentious book,"This book is easily one of the most-over-rated novels set in World War II. It does not compare favorably with many of the post-war novels set in that era. Read James Jones or Herman Wouk,instead, for good novels that do stand the test of time."
1,Painful,"I read this for college, and hated it. Don't like Norman Mailer, don't like his nonstandard spellings of swear words that are supposed to... what, be gritty but clean?"
2,Naked language and dead plot,"As we all know the book received a lot of hype. It's pretty interesting to read it this many years later especially as it is set up by mailers own preface in which she accuses himself of using way too many adjectives. I kept my eyes open but in retrospect I think that was probably a red herring. The first part starts out quite nicely and we are thrown into the midst of soldiers heading to a Pacific island. And for about half the book things work pretty well. And then bane of all banes, the author seems to have lost his way in the jungle, the plot falters, it gets extremely tedious, we know someone will fall off the edge of the cliff, etc. etc. and so like some form of jungle malaise we begin to nod off, not caring, and praying for the end. A lot of novelistic water has passed under the bridge since then and this is one book that just doesn't hold up."
1,Big disappointment,"I was hoping to find more than disillusionment and grossly unrealistic characters in this novel, maybe even a coherent storyline. It wasn't the lack of action in this novel that bothered me, it was the pointless construction and deconstruction of the plot and utter lack of a climax that grated on the nerves. I was disappointed and couldn't wait for the book to be over."
2,much adiue about very little,"this book has potential but fails to deliver the goods. too much time is invested for the pay off. i hated the time machine sequences they were a total waste of time, eventually i just skiped them to help get the book over. this is a shame because there were some very good parts to the book a good editor could have improved it by trimming a few hundred pages."
4,Norman Mailer's greatest work!,"This book is mostly about the interior thoughts resulting from exterior forces(the war, relatives back home, other soldiers). It is a wonderfully in depth study of character.In the end the characters show us that each of us is in some way naked and vulnerable to the world. Those that don't believe it are dead.This is a prime example of a book that should never be made into a movie because there is no way to portray such complex mental processes on film."
5,an amazing book,"this is historical fiction of ww 2 , and an amazing read, Mailertakes an immense interest in daily functions of troops , their emotional states and the general bureaucratic mundaneness of the assault on an isolated island in s pacific. He does in depth analysis of many features of us life in the 40s including the status of hispanic , jewish , southern and , bostonian soldiers.He is an intense and insightful writer. Many excerpts are not politically correct , including frequent sexual references, the n word but it reflects the times that were. Of interest are thelong term perspectives of the General to the geopolitical status of the world, quite correctly that the focus would be on anticommunism and of a future war with russia. YOu will not put this down, so be prepared for some very emotional portions such as wilsons death in the jungle and rather gruesome details of the true cost of war,,,,,,,, from korea to midway to normandy and now in iraq."
2,Didn't care for book,I started reading the book but never finished it. I did not care for the language and sexual content it was not what I had expected after reading some of the reviews.
2,Couldn't make it through,I know it's supposed to be a classic and I tried; I really tried.After about 200 pages I had to stop. It's like Mailer sat at the typewriter and just typed whatever popped into his head. On and on and on and.............Not my cup of tea. Sorry Norman.
5,Profound Banality,"This extraordinary book is not a war novel, but more of a character ensemble that is set in a war. The battles and strategic intrigues pale in effect next to the struggles against rain, mud, fatigue, fear, memories, and petty rivalries. No self-respecting Hollywood shlockmeister today would adapt this book into a film without adding some glorious fight scenes and an unambiguous hero. I only hope nobody ever tries, because ""punching up"" this novel would only serve to ruin the movie.Read this novel and see back through time what life was like, what people talked like, what WW2 was like for the grunts."
5,So much more than a story about a war,"This book was great, and it's even better if you happen to be married to a war veteran. It is more about the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and reactions of the men than the actual events of the campaign on Anopopei. The mountain, I think, symbolizes not only the war itself, but life with all its obstacles and struggles. It's one long, tortuous journey and every time you turn a bend, there's another obstacle in your path. You never do really reach the top because it's all controlled by a force greater and more powerful than you. Greater than your own intelligence, strength, skills and abilities. We are all climbing Mount Anaka."
4,A revealing account of the atrocities of war,"Being of a younger generation I am often exposed more to the occurences and happenings of Vietnam as opposed to World War II. The best of Vietnam literature, however, has found it's match in The Naked and the Dead. Even better than the accounts of the war are Mailer's ""Time Machine"" chapters where he reveals the depth of his characters on their own turf and shows the connections between all of us."
1,"Mailer - The most overrated author ever, ever.","This is my 2nd go around with ""The Naked and the Dead"". I'v read a lot of Mailer and come to the conclusion he was a very good writer when describing what happened to Norman Mailer. Otherwise, he was a joke.Which leads me to ""The naked and the Dead"". Great descriptions of combat and the jungle and what it feels like to be out at night, on a hot steamy jungle, straining to hear if the Japanese are coming to get you. But the soldiers are jokes or cardboard cut outs, and Mailer's ""philosophy"" nothing more than warmed-over 2nd hand Marxism with a Brooklyn accent.And the ""Time machine"" used by Mailer to describe the soldiers civilian life simply shows he knew nothing outside the world of Brooklyn or Harvard. None of his Non-New Yorker characters ring true.Its amazing how good the WW I novels are, and how poor the WW II ones are. Or in other words: Just Fudge it, just Fudge it all to hell."
2,Would you rather be a mule?,"I am at a total loss regarding this book. If you wanted to pack a mule and find out how much the average weight of one is, this is the book for you. Other than that, the entire cast including Molly and Dwight, are nothing but cardboard characters with no spark or life to them. The dialogue never flows or has the ring to it that we all look for.Any sex you find in the story I would classify as silly and juvenille.I truly looked forward to buying this book and when read was most disappointed in its contents.I guess, I'm just not a mule packing guy! I'll just have to go back to Will James or Zane Grey and try again."
2,Disappointing,"I love horses, the outdoors, and the Sierras so was prepared to love this book. Wrong! The characters are paper-thin, and the plot so very predictable. From the first it was apparent tnat Dwight and Molly would get together, have a falling out, and get back together at the end, Jake would have coming of age experiences and the business would be finished by the actions of the villain, etc. It is nowhere near the quality of Lonesome Dove. This book goes straight to the Goodwill box."
3,Almost like being there,"Having spent many days in the eastern sierras, I could almost see the High Lonesome and terrain surrounding while reading this book. Very enjoyable and easy to read."
4,Works great,"Firestone 2071 Ride-Rite Air Springs KitThis kit gives a great ride and takes the load off the leaf springs. The only suggestion I have is to order the model that requires no drilling. The lines and wires behind the left frame were difficult to drill around and practically impossible to get the bolts through the frame. It can be done but takes forever, needs two people and more than just a socket set and open-end wrenches. Still, I'm glad I did it and very satisfied with the results."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed by the projects contained in this book. The title says ""Over 40 small, exciting, and innovating projects"" and strictly speaking that's true. However there are not that many designs. For instance, the first 4 projects use the same salmon design in different arrangements - with a celtic border, on a cushion, as a sachet and as a card. This is ingenious and useful but if you don't care for this particular design, there go 4 projects out of the book that you don't want to do. I would have liked to have seen more different designs instead of these multi-uses of the same design (the grapes design later on is also shown as a card, a sachet, a placemat, and a napkin, another 4 projects). That said, I still found patterns that I liked a lot and feel that on the whole the book was worth purchasing."
4,Great for Argentine Tango Dancers,"Francisco Canaro's musical career spanned from around 1910 to the 1950s. So the cuts on this album have a beautiful, nostalgic, big-band sound to them. If you are purchasing this album simply for listening, you might feel that the songs ""all sound the same"", since they are all by the same artist. In that case, I would recommend an album by various artists such asThe Best Tango Album in the World, Ever!(Capitol Records). However, if you are an Argentine Tango dancer, you will find that this album provides lots of variety for dancing. There are 9 tangos, 4 milongas, and 5 very lovely valses. The danceable tempos make this album one of my favorites. Another good album for dancers isBailemos Tango!: A Century of Tango on the Dance Floor(Rhino) by various artists. It also contains many tangos and milongas, but only one vals."
2,Radiation Pathology,"This text serves as a good reference for the pathology of radiation injuries. Of course, for the details, one should go to the primary sources. The Amazon.com discount purchase was worth it."
1,The last book on Paper Flowers you'll want,"Making Paper and Fabric Flowers is a rare book for an obvious reason, well obvious once you read the book. It is one of the worst instruction books on paper or fabric flower making I've read, and my library on paper flower books is perhaps 100+. Obviously, the public felt the same way when it first came out, so it enjoyed a brief and limited printing.Photographs are non-existent and the line drawings, while plentiful don't really expand on the wordy instructions. The directions are written in ""steps"", that is, each rambling paragraph is headed by ""step 1"", ""step 2"" etc. but this is not step-by-step direction. The author constantly retraces steps, refers back to procedures(by the way, remember to...) And many of the directions are so wordy as to make nonsense of what should be a sensible scissor cut or simple method of shaping a bloom.I would buy a poo for $200 before buying this book at that price."
4,surprisingly good.,"Though it's akin to a few movies. This is a fresher take on a movie about a type of cult. The writers, director and producer did a great job with this."
3,This was a gift,I think my son sent this to me. It's okay even though I don't understand it. I'll try to read it for him.
3,The preface is better than the book,"The book begins with a promise. The preface, the calculations on Yugas are simply superb considering the time it was written. The actual contents seem to be lost in interpretations that may make the experience feel like another philosophical interpretation of the Vedas and Vedantic Texts. In fact, interpretations by folks who have never experienced the Vedas or the Orient."
3,The Holy Science,This book is concise but it seems to touch on the core elements of yoga and in the process correlate with biblical verses that echoes the same thing.The book was received faster than expected which increases inclination to purchase online with Amazon.
4,Explore the Depth and Scope of Yoga,"This short book by the guru of Paramahansa Yogananda has made me appreciate the depth and scope of yoga in a meaningful way. The book is definitely not for everyone, but sincere truth seekers will not be disappointed.Gudjon Bergmann, author ofLiving in the Spirit of Yoga: Take Yoga Off the Mat and Into Your Everyday LifeandThe Seven Human Needs: A practical guide to finding harmony and balance in everyday life"
3,"ok book, just not to digestable to modern readers","I've read AutoBiography of a Yogi and from there found a Kriya Yoga group in my area and was initiated into this practice. I must say that it is rewarding as is any meditation practice. I personally can't say that it knocked me off my feet, but I like it, its good enough for me.After reading several Kriya books and being to many satsangs, etc.... i have come to the conclusion that for most of us, these teachings have only a certain amount of appeal....the messages hold a certain relevance to modern life up to a point, after that it becomes quite dated.Although I continue to gobbled up yoga and kriya related books as i can, i found most of them inspiring yet a little outdated. There are very few writers from this spiritual background who have been able to write books that continually speak to my modern experience. This one is no different yet I have much respect for it and its author."
5,So precious,"If you want to understand the Creation, God, cosmic astrology, reading this book and meditating on each sentence is a must. There is only one Truth."
5,"Review of book, ""Holy Science""","Sri Yukteswar writes about what is common between Eastern and Western religions, and ably proves that there are many things in common. One is reminded of the travels of Jesus in his youth to the East to learn the same things. Sri Yukteswar also correctly describes the beginning of the New Age in terms of Eastern cycles of years called, ""Yugas."" This information corresponds exactly with what we know today about the coming winter solstice, and this is significant because the manuscript was set down in the year 1897. A good book, which also teaches pertinent sanscrit terms."
2,Measure your fenders!,This item does not fit the large Taylor made fenders. It was a few inches short. I had to return them.
5,Hugh Laurie,"Hugh Laurie at the top of his game in a morality tale that remains more current than ever in light of the Madoff, etc. schemes. Must see. Slow start... hang in there!"
2,Painful to watch,"This movie was too painful to even watch to its conclusion. I really enjoy Hugh Laurie, and his acting was quite good in this movie. The character he played was on such a downward spiral through an addiction that it was utterly unenjoyable. I couldn't see past this very pitiful character and very sad story. Perhaps I'm into escapism when I watch a movie. Sad stories are one thing, but watching an addict spiral downward is just annoying."
1,Not worth a shirt.,"""Military style"" and military quality are two unique things. This is only the former.Grommet came out second trip to the laundry-mat, leaving a gaping tear that is only going to get bigger with each trip. Material is thin, even with laundry duty this will likely not last a year."
5,Great laundry bag,"Bought this to use as a (wait for it...) LAUNDRY BAG!!!! Appears to be very well made, it's actually thicker and tougher feeling than the one I was issued in the Army but then the one I was issued is 24 years old so it's a bit softer now (but still as sturdy as ever!). The stitching is all good and the tie strings feel like they'll last as well. It's been through several washes since I purchased it and still no signs of wear so for ~$9 you really can't go wrong."
1,Junk,No better than a bag purchased at a local store. Straps snapped after 3 uses and 2 washes. Bag tore along seam on 3rd use. Looks nice enough.
1,Poor Quality,"Well, the bag seemed nice enough; that was, until I loaded it up with laundry. The minute I picked the bag up, the eyelet ripped out. It's not much good to me anymore, and it seems it wasn't very good at being a laundry bag."
3,GI bag.,This item is not original GI type bag.and besides too small it looks big on the picture...G. I. Type Laundry Bag
2,Much smaller than a real military laundry bag,"What was delivered was not what I thought I ordered. There are two sizes of this bag, this is the smaller kind and is much smaller than the real military issue ones."
3,Tough one,"I suppose that this book is going to be read by the ones who are familiar with work of Breton. Let us just say, for the sake of beeng, that I do not encourage others to read it. You will soon lose yourself in endless circles that great nadrealist has woven into his text.Very complicated to understand this book presents authors view on love - or as he says it - ""only possible love is mad love"". Now, this statemnt can be observed as a kind of tautological experiment, but it can also be observed as poetic value in itslef.In the beeginig very fluent in his narrative, Breton, almost instantly loses himself in some sort of weird hermetism, in which there are motives and object that are totaly undechiperable, at least to no one but himself.Read this only if you are just studying french modernism or something, otherwise skip it..."
2,Uneasy,"None of the information given in this book is documented with footnotes. There are some general attributes given for each chapter at the end of the book. It just makes me uneasy that the material does not come with adequate sources.Especially after one glaring error is to be found throughout the description of the religious clashes between the Scots and the English.The author refers to the Church of England as being the Episcopal Church. It is not. That would be the Anglican Church as opposed to the Episcopal Church or religion in the U.S. The Anglican Church became the Episcopal Church,in this country, after the Revolutionary War. The English monarchy is the head of the Church of England and we fought that deadly war to found our country's independence from the English monarchy.I found that I couldn't really finish this book because of my doubts."
2,Uneasy with this book,"At times interesting, at times dull. I was fine with that until I came to page 235 to read about Scotts in the American South. Herman says the term ""redneck"" was a Scots border term meaning Presbyerterians and ""cracker"" was also a Scottish term. That was news to me. I've checked with several sources and have never been able to find any indication this was true.Things like that, and the absence of footnotes, leads me to feel uneasy about the accuracy of this book.I shared some of the book with my church's business administrator, a native of Scotland. His response was to laugh and ask, ""Who is this man?""I suspect Herman is American. It shows when he refers to the Church of England as Episcopal -- which is technically true, but non-americans would have referred to the Church of England as Anglican. A telling moment that also made me wonder about the biases Herman may have brought in to the writing.All in all, I just felt uneasy about trusting the author and his sources."
4,"Interesting book, a little uneven","I found the first half of ""How the Scots Invented the Modern World"" to be very informative and entertaining. The portraits of Hutcheson, Kames, Hume and Smith were interesting both by themselves and in the way in which the author explained the connections (both personal and intellectual) between these thinkers of the Scottish ""Enlightenment."" I was convinced that in one sense these Scots really did invent the modern world, or at least the modern mindset.The book weakens, however, as it becomes in the second half a fairly pedestrian retelling of accomplishments of Scotsmen and their descendants. It was refreshing not to read any excessive English-bashing in this account, in fact, it might be the most pro-English book about Scotland I have read."
3,A LITTLE MISLEADING,"If you think that this is a book primarily of scotsmen and their achievements, its not.There is a great deal of scots contributions but it is more a Scot/English history 16t-19th century.Particularly dealing with enlightenment and philosophy.Throw in some American history and you have a good well researched volume on Scottish influence and accomplishments in this time period.However in typical phd fashion the author appears to have been paid by the word ,as much as the content.At times stimulating, but more often redundant.With theasaurus in hand the writer pedantically belabors a point time and again.The book could have easily been 50 pages shorter and a better flowing read.One wonders how long the original unedited manuscript was.As an avid reader of scottish history I acknowledge there are facts here that are hard to find in other publications, hence the 3 star rating."
4,The Scots Indeed,"Although the title of this tome would initially seem to be arrogant, the author does a masterful job of proving his thesis (which, by the way, is the book's title). There indeed are times when the reader can feel overwhelmed by this proof--such as those references to Scottish ancestors of major movers who were not Scots when they became famous. Further, he does give credit to non-Scots, from time-to-time, such as to John Locke for his contributions to the political scientific roots of the American Declaration of Independence. All in all, this is a very good read, and it covers a signficantly broad area of the intellectual and practical ancestors of our modern-day Western world. We agree that the Scots did invent a good deal of the modern world."
4,Don't let the title keep you away from this book.,"Don't let the title keep you from reading this book. While it does trumpet the achievements of the Scottish people, it is primarily a history of the Scottish enlightenment and its impact on the world. Indeed, it was a remarkable period with a lasting influence. Among the products of this era were Adam Smith, David Hume, and Edward Gibbon. While it is a book of history, as the title suggests, it is a popular history so don't expect lots of footnotes. It is very well written and kept my interest from start to finish."
3,A tough read,"Heads up - I'm Scottish, so I have a vested interest in this book.....I actually got this book mistaking it for another title (there's one that talks about some of the major inventions that Scot's have been involved in - it would surprise you.........).I've had the book for about 2 months now and I'm about 200 pages in. While it is an interesting book - I've learned quite a few interesting things about my history - it's heavy and slow going.Unless you have a genuine deep seated reason for reading this - like me - this isn't going to be a book for a casual, throw away, ""beach"" type read."
1,Disappointing... Missing 32 pages,"I ordered this book to serve as a portion of my curriculum in an independent study course on Scotland. Unfortunately, this copy was printed and/or bound poorly. It is completely missing pages 409-440 and therefore I was unable to use it for my course. I wish I had noticed before the return date had elapsed. Very disappointing.Please check your copy carefully upon receipt!"
2,"Hmmm, maybe I missed something...","but I found this one of the driest books I've read in ages. I was quite eager to learn more about the history of Scotland and the Scots; it's part of my heritage. And I have read scholarly works before, so it's not that I am unfamiliar with such or expected a novel. However, this man took what is doubtless a very interesting topic, and made me cringe repeatedly with his complete lack of finesse with words. It was so dull and ham-handed!I cannot recommend anything in its place, and there is some good data in the book, but I am really astonished at the good reviews! By all means buy it, but just don't expect a riveting read to keep you awake till the wee hours or anything."
2,A grand title for a book that is so anti-Scottish,"This book flatters to deceive. Despite its grand title, rather than offering a new take on Scottish history and culture, it simply repeats tired old prejudices and down-right lies about Scotland's gaelic past. There is no historian who can offer an accurate account of Scotland's history, without having a proper knowledge of her gaelic/celtic heritage, and this author has evidently allowed his prejudices to get the better of him when commenting on the gaelic part of Scotland's history, using far too many quotes by British imperialist agents designed to negate and excuse their attempts at cutural and ethnic genocide."
5,nice story,"Scots and ethnic Scots tend to go their own way. This book describes some Scottish innovations, which spread elsewhere. The US Constitution was based on Iroquois and Scots models, as one example. I liked this book."
4,Required reading,"Yes there's a bit of hyperbole but if you're looking for an interesting, well written history on the contribution of Scotland to westernculture this is a very good book.The Book doesn't really start until the act of union but it does a great job of covering some of the lesser known (at least to me)gem s of scottish history both good and bad. Yes it does ""damn with faint praise"" to use the words of another reviewer but isn't that the nature of truth. I think it shows how the scotts have succeded and contributed to the modern world in many cases in strife, acrimony and in spite of themselves.I read this book just before my first trip to Scotland and it helped imensly in my enjoyment of the country and it's people.Any history that shows all the hero's belonging to one nation, doing right all the time and overcoming tremendous odds everytime heroicly is a fairytale"
4,Scottish science,"After a radical rejection of that eras Roman Catholic Church, Scotland ambles into an era of greatly increasing literacy and community involvement. By the early 1700s things are really rolling. Herman describes the ideas of political correctness and Adam Smith very well.Today political correctness is the process of being less than honest to avoid hurting peoples feelings. In highland Scotland it became a new set of manners adapted so that clan chieftans didn't go around summarily executing people. It became known as being ""polite"".Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is also explained well. Smith justified or explained some benefits of the Profit Motive. But not Profit Taking. Remember that the next time you go to the local butcher shop or by some pins for your shirt."
3,Highly Academic,"As a History major(25 years ago)I am familiar with heavily researched narratives. . . but for some reason I was expecting this book to be a little lighter.Good book, interesting and valid thesis . . . but somewhat plodding.The whole magilla would have been improved by the inclusion of some Maps and images."
1,Not worth the effort,"As someone with Scottish heritage, and a professional historian (of the U.S., not Scotland), I was initially enthusiastic about reading this book. I was soon disappointed. For a popular work, this is pretty dull reading (and this comes from someone who reads academic prose for a living). The lack of footnotes is also troubling. But what most bothers me is that this book not only damns the Scots with faint praise (as other reviewers have observed), it also is a not too subtle dig at multiculturalism (which he periodically picks out throughout the book). The conclusion -- that the Scots have no claims to a pan-Celtic heritage that condemns English imperialism -- is especially heavy handed and unconvincing. The fact that one of the author's other major works is an equally problematic apology for Senator Joseph McCarthy casts even more suspicion on the author's methodology and possible bias. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Makes me think,I have a Scottish last name and have always been interested in the history of Scotland. This book is easy to read on difficult subjects like Adam Smith. It really made me think about whether Capitalism is the driving force of the world. If people have enough material things do they conform. In the US with lot's of different kinds of people that seems to be the case. It also appears that even the worst off in the US has a TV and is probably better off than the best off in sub-Sahara Africa. I don't want to argue who is happier. I also was interested that Lowland Scots were Presbyterian and English Episcopalian. I loved the reference to English as high-browed. I still see the British as Stogy to the point of their own downfall. My last name is a Highlander name so now I wonder if we came after the 45. Anyway I'm not finished with this yet but really enjoyed it..
1,DId not work,"It's a nice device if you want to just look at it. I could not get the reception in my house. I placed the antenna at my window facing north/northwest as instructed and got nothing. I tried at every window and even outside. The best I could get was two minutes of reception followed by ten minutes of silence. The customer service people at Xact were impolite and not helpful. They told me that I needed to place the antenna on my roof. Obviously, if I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Sirius is a great service, but do not buy Xact products."
1,Still waiting for one that works.,I received the XTR1UK Sirius Satellite Receiver & Universal Kit as a gift in a sealed carton that had a faulty display. It was returned to Xact Customer Service in GA and I received another sealed Receiver within several weeks. This second unit did not work properly also. This time there was no audio even though the display indicated a strong signal. It has been 5 weeks since I sent back the second receiver and still no replacement has been received. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this model until you check the other reviews.
3,Ok function and features - but not great by any standard,"I have had the unit two weeks and worked hard to make it function as required. First the FM signal to my radio is so weak that there is too much noise, what happen to CD quality?Due to the FM broadcast issue I had to have it mounted and setup with a hard wire into my system which cost an additional $100.The screen and functions are managable, but not great. This is a pull over and reset unit, it is way to hard to manage this unit while driving because it is not designed for ease of use and the screen is so small and hard to read.The unit gets very hot so you have to mount it accordingly. Holding the unit and using the keys is uncomfortable because of the heat, so the remote is a required tool.The antena had to be on the roof because through a window it did not get enough signal.Overall I liked the low price and have fixed most of the issues, but would not purchase this unit again if there were any other choice."
1,horrible reception,"this unit is not worth the plastic it was assembled with. for some unknown reason it plays for about an hour then ""acquiring signal"" kicks in. turn it on and off, leave it off. nothing. I called Sirius. they claim it's not their service but sounds like a defect. I'll be returning this piece of sh-t soon as I get hold of customer service where i purchased it. avoid XACT products"
2,Coolmax leaves a lot to be desired,"I've had experience with Coolmax over the years. I build computers for a living and as a hobby. These power supplies are sub-standard and generally last until the warranty runs out. The efficiency ratio is poor.The last PS I had from Coolmax not only failed 2 weeks after the warranty had expired but it also fried my motherboard and all the memory. Fortunately, AMD CPUs seem impervious to power spikes and my Opteron 185 sailed though. I wound up getting a Corsair PSU - which I highly recommend."
3,This cable work,"i buy this charger, it works fine, but i notice that the turning lights on my nissan frontier 2003 doesnt work properly when i use charge, it appears to draw much amperes from the cigarrete lighter."
4,Wit and Wisdom of a Combat Leader,"A thoroughly enjoyable read. Witty and engaging, but at the same time, thought provoking and full of wisdom. Leadership is an art. Like any other form of art it requires energy, enthusiasm and creativity. A select few are masters of this art form, blessed with the intuition and insight which mark the truly great leader. Colonel Hilgartner is such a leader. The anecdotes which pepper his narrative provide valuable lessons for those who would lead others, whether in battle or in business. The short vignettes which make up this book make it an ideal read for subway commuters and others who are often interrupted. Its easy-going humor and thoughtful insights make it a book which I will go back to over and over again."
4,the smoker's lament,"This book is funny, charming, and very well written. It's a pleasure to be inside the head of her wonderfully misanthropic narrator - the most sociable hermit I've ever come across. Christensen is even good at funny sex scenes. But I didn't quite buy the epicure part of the book-- the cooking doesn't play into the plot nearly as well as the smoking and the recipes are kind of backwoods for a post 9/11 gourmet. The author also is compelled to soften all her funny dark humor toward the end too much. But, all in all, an extremely enjoyable read."
3,The Bookschlepper recommends,"A clearly-depressed man whittles his days down with cigarettes and delusions as his family encroaches on his solitary life. He repels them while also cooking them good meals, uncorking fine wines and initiating intense sex. Excellent treatment of an unlikeable hero whose slow descent into madness is or is not ultimately proven to be reality. Christensen captures the male voice well and the irritability could be contagious."
4,Yum,"As far as story goes, this one's lacking. This is not the most compelling book I've ever read. It is, however, one of the best-written character studies I've read.I loved Hugo Whittier, despite his horribleness. He has a lot of unappealing characterstics. He's a drunk, a womanizer, and a deadbeat. But he's also a brilliant writer, and a highly intelligent cynic.As far as language goes, this book has it all. Beautiful prose, biting sarcasm and cynicism, sick humor, and obscenity. I burst out laughing at some one-liners every now and then while reading this book.All in all, you're not supposed to love Hugo as a person, but you can't help but love him as a character."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this book for a friend and for me as a holiday read because the reviews were really good. We're both in the food profession and I thought it would be fun to read a fiction work (rather than non-fiction). I also thought this sounded different from other fiction/food books I'd read in the past. Well, unfortunately, food does not take the center stage and, as my friend noted, the author does not sound like she likes her main character. The plot has some interesting twists and turns and it's journal format is interesting. However, I wouldn't say that the focus was on food at all. I definitely enjoyed <The Last Chinese Chef> quite a bit more."
5,Wow,"Such a great book...I stayed up until three AM to finish it. Hugo Whittier is a man bent on smoking himself to death, full of wicked schemes and machinations that are foiled by his unspoken loves and the love of others. But don't get me wrong...he's got plenty to say. As Lily Tomlin said, ""I try to be cynical, but it's hard to keep up."" Along the way we hear delicious ruminations on Montaign, MFK Fisher, Erasmus, among others...the author's voice so piquant and intelligent, a death so worthwhile watching."
2,Unless you LOVE Hemingway... don't bother,"The cover reads, ""His greatest love story."" There is only a tidbit of love speckled here and there. For the most part the novel is completely absent of any females. It actually seems to be 3 books in one with very little connection between them. Part one was very visual and the story flowed excellently. Parts two and three Hemingway completely lost my interest. I couldn't follow where he was taking me, there were so many disconnects, it felt like a smattering of short stories none with any sort of conclusion. I was left wondering why he even included some sections. I found myself forcing myself to finish in hopes there would be a sudden twist and reading this book would have been worthwhile. Unfortunately, I was dissappointed."
4,to all you reviewers who thought this a poor book...,"Geez people,Give the man a break! Did Hemingway have this published? NO!!! Did he even consider it complete? NO!!!It was simply family members and friends who weren't finished collecting cash under Hemingway's name. He did not want it published! It is simply a manuscript that got published and not a novel. Remember this.So, all your blistering commentaries on the book need to be taken under this consideration... the book is, in Hemingway's eye, not a final product. And to be honest, for an incomplete product, it's still better then most anything written today.Next time you bake a pie I'm gonna come over when it is halfway finished, try it and tell you what a sucky baker you are. Or better yet, when you are up late at night working on your beautiful ""literary"" review, I am going to come over before you edit, spell check and re-read and tell you your review is amateurish and that your skills have decreased.Sheesh, people."
5,first hemingway book for me,"This book achieves one of the highest aims of fiction: transport the reader to another place and time. Its really a simple goal and Hemingway makes it look so easy with the simple sentences and with characters so real you absolutely wanna hang out with them and fire flares at a bunch of gas barrels while getting hammered on a dock some place south of Florida. My faith in fiction was renewed more than a few notches thanks to Islands in the Stream. It can be a heart-breaker, however. Still great, nonetheless."
4,One of the better posthumous publications.,This is one of the better posthumous publications of Hemingway. It has his wonderfully distinctive style and story themes. I even recommend this over some of the novels released during Hemingway's life. A worthy part of any Hemingway collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
3,A Rollercoaster in Writing,"This is a very uneven book, unfinished at the time of Hemingway's suicide. Mary Hemingway and various editors slapped this one together from an on-again, off-again project Hemingway wasn't able to complete during his last decade of life due to his alcoholism, creaping schizophrenia and lack of fire. The sections of the book were meant to be virtually separate books and they read that way. Mark, the Calabrian reviewer, is right- the Cuban section is terrible. I believe Hemingway wrote much of it while drunk. The Bimini section is excellent except, having vacationed in Bimini myself, Hemingway sugarcoats the place. The Bimini he explains to his readers is actually more like Abaco, Green Turtle Cay, Eluethera or, most likely, Key West. The At Sea section is also fine to read. Funny, Islands in the Stream is a case where the movie version (starring George C. Scott) is probably of higher quality than the book."
2,Merely a shadow of For Whom the Bell Tolls,"In this hefty novel, Hemingway reincarnates Robert Jordan and the plot and themes of For Whom the Bell Tolls. Being Hemingway, Islands in the Stream is well-written (although not as well as many of his other novels), but there's nothing new here. Islands in the Stream is a last ditch effort by a dying master."
1,A disjointed book.,I was very disappointed by this book. Perhaps that is explained by the fact that the writer did not finish it himself. I found reading it to be a waste of my time.
3,Good - Bad Hemingway,"This is an uneven book. The first part, set in Bimini in the 1930's, and the third part, which describes the hunt for a U-Boat crew off the coast of Cuba, are quite good and contain many passages in the best Hemingway style. The middle section is too long and contains too many digressions in the bad Hemingway style. With all its faults, Islands in the Stream carries a powerful emotional charge. The reader feels that Thomas Hudson is the older Hemingway and that the book is a key to his inner preoccupations. As always, Hemingway excels in descriptions of the physical life. Small boat owners will appreciate his evocation of the glamour and perils of life at sea."
3,Not His Best Work,"First, let me say that I don't presume to be any kind of qualified literary critic. However, as someone who has read other books by this brilliant writer, I found this book to be disappointing. It's clearly the style and the voice of Hemingway, but the story itself is lacking, as can sometimes be the case with posthumously published works. Clearly autobiographical, the book does offer insights into Hemingway's relationships with women (and cats!), his attitude toward his work and toward drinking, which are quite interesting. But the only moments of truly compelling interest for me came in his descriptions of men risking their lives in a desperate cause.A worthwhile read, but if you are just getting into reading Hemingway, I think you would be better off starting with one of his classic earlier works."
4,Essential reading,"Peter Feaver's book offers a new perspective on civil-military relations from Huntington's classic model. Using agency theory, Feaver seeks to explain how civilians can and should maintain control of the military. As a professor who teaches civil-military relations, I find his work very useful in explaining concepts in the classroom.Ed CoxAuthor of Grey Eminence: Fox Conner and the Art of Mentorship"
5,Jon,"I first heard Kasey Chambers on NPR, Sunday Edition. I thought I'd try it and I found that I enjoy this album more everytime I hear it. And I'm 52. Good stuff!"
5,"Show in Asheville, NC","I have really enjoyed all her work. All of the songs, arrangements and band are just great. She put on a show here in Asheville that was 110% or more! Got to take my daughter to the Asheville show and then again at the last show up in St. Paul. Now I am ready to go see her show at home. The band came out to the audience to talk to all; I enjoyed a chat with Bill about the ""that must have been exciting times"" in the 60's. If you want to hear, some good music get all the albums because it is all just great."
5,Who is that singer?,"The first time Kasey Chambers played on my PC, my wife immediately said ""who is that?!"". We both thought her voice was so unique - somewhat child-like, yet so mature, powerful, and vulnerable at the same time. She doesn't have the vibrato of a Jewel - yet, her voice is very clear and strong - she adds a beautiful texture to any playlist. I am really glad I discovered her. Kasey reminds me of Patty Griffin on some of my favorites of hers, such as ""Making Pies"", ""Be Careful"", and ""Rain""."
4,Down Under Country,"How does a woman from Australia make a better country CD than 90% of what passes for country in Nashville? Casey Chambers made this wonderfully song and beautifully played CD and all she got for it was a cult following in the US. (As opposed to her home continent where she is a star.) Maybe if she recorded a hack novelty song like ""Redneck Girl"" instead of the shuffling swing of ""Pony"" (""and I'll name it after Ralph Stanley""), or some cheesy ballad instead of the banjo accented and realistically emotional title track, she'd crack the shallow gene pool of country radio.But as for me, I am happy to listen to this honest and emotional CD. If your definition of country music leans more towards Lucinda Williams or The Dixie Chicks, then ""Wayward Angel"" and Casey Chambers' short but captivating catalog - I also recommend ""The Captain"" - will be in your high rotation."
3,Am I not petty enough?,"I ordered the import of Wayward Angel, as I just couldn't wait for it to come out in the US domestically. It will not play on my computer, it just locks up my applications. It will not get downoaded to my MP3 jukebox due to the copyright protection. I heard three tracks in the car today, but after I stopped the car the cd will not start playing again. Look for this one in the cut out bins very soon, as this copyright protection will kill this disc. I guess I'll have to go back to listening to ""Barricades and Brick Walls"". The three songs that I have heard so far just don't have the stark raw beauty of the two records before it. Maybe it will play on the jambox in the garage, and be worth the hassle of listening to it!"
3,A step in the wrong direction,"After the genre-bending joy of Chambers's last release Barricades and Brickwalls, I found myself a little troubled by Wayward Angel. Quite simply there are stretches of it that could've been made by any country-pop artist - ""Mother,"" ""For Sale,"" and especially the single ""Hollywood"" are watered-down, and dare I say, even a little boring, to the point that they could have been made by Faith Hill. Chambers is still a gifted artist, undoubtedly, and she proves it for a good portion of the album - the sexy come on of ""Pony,"" the bluegrass assault of ""Follow You Home,"" the magnificent tenderness of ""Lost and Found."" But when Chambers indulges her pop tendencies, the results get generic, and for someone as original as Chambers, that gets a bit scary to hear."
3,Good if you can hear it,"I like to play/listen to cd's on my pc at work. Alas, though I love Kasey Chambers I've got to tell you that because of the copyright protection on this one I can't play it. My disk drive goes haywire (windows xp) when I put in the cd, I get a gazillion error boxes and have to re-boot. Finally, I played it on our new cd player at home and I liked the album... but that doesn't do much good for me at work unless I invest in a stand alone player. Funny, because I first heard Kasey on napster and since then have bought every one of her albums. I won't buy another."
2,Disappointing,"I have considered myself to be one of KC's biggest fans, at least in America. But I am disappointed in this album. Of course, I haven't heard the whole thing because I CAN'T! It is ""copy-protected"" and the CD itself proclaims that ""playback problems"" may occur on some equipment. Well, playback problems DO occur in my car's CD player, which is where I listen to my CDs. So I paid $30 for a CD that I can't listen to -- at least not all of it. It won't ""track,"" sometimes it won't play at all, and sometimes it won't even eject from the CD player.I like the first 3 songs but beyond that I can't say that I'm terribly impressed. I miss the ""grit"" of Barricades and Brickwalls. It just doesn't seem to have the power of B&B or the sweetness of The Captain. Quite simply, I'm disappointed."
2,Disappointing - Kasey strikes out here,"This album is boring. I hate to write that because I liked her previous two releases. The music and production on this one have nothing memorable with the exception of ""Follow You Home"". Poor Kasey. Hopefully she'll hook up with Dwight Yoakam or Jim Lauderdale - that would be a step up from this mess. No wonder it hasn't garnered any good press. My copy is going into the wastebasket."
1,One listen is too much,"I'm always on the lookout for something new. When I heard a selection on Sirius, I thought she showed promise. But Chamber's whiney, nasal voice and her trite lyrics - and I mean trite and pointless - have left me baffled why she was given a record contract in the first place. Her voice is grating in my head as I write this now.I may give it another listen, if by chance I lose my memory or if I've had too much to drink."
1,Trust your mother!,"My mother always said 'if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all' I think I'll leave it at that!"
1,Worst Real-Estate Book I've ever bought,This is basically a marketing ad for Mr. Hicks own publications. Very Impractical. His guide is summed up at the end of the book in about 3 pages. DON'T waste your money or time...
2,"Ty Hicks often mentions the glamor of $, w/o the responsibil","After reading numerous chapters of ""you can do it"" and repeated citings of big $$ acquisitions without mention of cash flow risk, I found myself skimming over the fluff in search of pearls of wisdom. There are a few but Ty spends too much time motivating, and not enough time or detail on how."
4,Not bad,"All in all, not a bad effort by Ty. I agree with the previous reviewer in that he does a lot of ""cheering"", but there is good information here as well."
2,mirage,"Mr. Hicks plays on the inexperience and the desperate. He focuses only on the successes and does not mention the possible pitfalls in real estate. I found the book somewhat informative, but was quite annoyed with his pitch to subscribe to his publication."
1,Check this out!,"This book was first published in 1978!I seriously doubt Mr. Hicks rewrote one word of this book for the 90's.Gimme a break! Click on Mr. Hicks' name under the title. This will give you a list of other books written by him. Scroll down to his ""Kits"" Most of them about mail-order, real estate, etc. were published in 1987! Wow."
1,Those wicked stepmothers,"As for who died in the fairy tale, you may recall Cinderella had a problem with her wicked *stepmother,* which strongly implies that it must have been daddy who died.In any case, to question Ms. Rainer's excellent book and advice based on her version of a fairy tale seems somewhat akin to judging her work based on whether or not we like her taste in fashion accessories. Totally irrelevant.The book is very useful, filled with practical advice and inspiration. *The Nine Essential Elements of Story Structure* and *Genres of the Self* were two of the chapters I found particularly insightful. Those two chapters alone will teach you how to make a viable story from life experience."
4,If you can afford only one book,If you can afford to buy only one book to help you write your memoir then buy Your Life as Story by Tristine Rainer. She has broken down the creative process of writing a memoir into do-able steps. Follow them and you will create a book. The only thing that I didn't like was her frequent use of vulgarity. It was something that I needed to filter to get to the good stuff she was teaching.
2,Not an exceptional TNG story,"I bought this mostly because I read a lot of ST books but never a comic book, so I was curious. The character and ship drawings are fine, with the worst being Data. The action is fast paced, but underdeveloped, but it's a comic book, so it's OK. The writing is very bad. Also, the writer didn't have a good grasp of the characters. Their actions/reactions seem out of place compared with other Trek literature or TNG."
3,Good outweighs the bad,"This collection includes some of the best Sonic games (Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Chaos), as well as some of the worst (Sonic Drift, 3D Blast). Overall, for the price, this is a great collection and lots of fun, especially for kids who maybe haven't played the older games. Some of them hold up real well and the Xbox adaptation works well in most cases. At this price, it's a good purchase, given how few kid-friendly games Xbox has."
5,Sonic Mega Collection Plus,"This has to be one of the best video games I've played on Xbox. For only $20, you get about 13 games + unlockable games + bonuses. All the games come in one disc. The games come from the Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear. The bonus features consists of Comics, Movies, and more!If you own Xbox (or PS2), this game is a must have!"
4,6 or so good games in one,"Exactly as advertised. As one who liked the original 2d sonic videogames, this is a nice blast from the past. It has the console and game gear versions of several games, and had several sonic offshoots(pinball etc) which I didn't really care for.But still there are at least 6 games that I enjoyed and that's more than worth the price tag."
5,A Bunch for Your Money!!!,"I ordered this for my 4yr old grandson because I remembered having some fun with it on an old Sega Genesis unit years ago. Besides the price, the better part of this deal was the fact that this XBox version has all the Sonic episodes on 1 disc and he is loving it!Sonic Mega Collection Plus"
4,Interesting at the least,"This album strolls the boundary of genius and stupidity, like when one asks, ""How very stoned am I?""Personally, I find fault with the recording quality - artistic use of noise and flat-sounding drums are great - but this ends up just seeming lazy and sloppy (especially the 60Hz hum at the end of 'Over the falls'). I also don't find Les' playing to be rhythmically tight, which again walks a boundary for me."
4,ALL GOOD MUSIC FESTIVAL,I THOUGH THIS ALBUM WAS TIGHT! DON'T FORGET PEOPLE PRIMUS IS BACK TOGETHER AND PLAYING AT THE ALL GOOD MUSIC FESTIVAL IN WV THIS SUMMER JULY 14-20TH 2011!! DON'T MISS IT TICKETS ARE ON SALE NOW!!!
3,Dosen't smell that bad,"Even with questionable production (drums in particular) and some lazy songwriting continuing a small but sequential decline in quality which eventually ended up rendering Claypool's first love unnecessary, The Brown Album still falls in the favor of acquisition, and for some may even be a pleasant ongoing change where this bassmaster continues to stress fun over frenzy, even if this frontman's version of fun was always a little bit different."
2,Hmm,"It's okay I guess, it's definatley not Frizzle Fry or Sailign the Seas of Cheese. I find myself skipping almost all of the tracks, exept 1, 2 and 8. Other songs have thier moments, but all in all it isn't too good.Word to the wise, spend your money on something else. I usually don't condone downloading over buying, but when the cd only has 3 good songs and 2-3 okay ones it's definatley not worth it. Infact, the only reason why I havn't traded it in for something else is because I'm a primus fan, and I like to collect things ;P"
4,Unjustly crticized,"For some reason every Primus album that is not Frizzle Fry or Sailing The Seas Of Cheese is knocked by a good number of Primus fans. I guess because they want the same two albums over and over. Anyway on to the album, the production on this album is great, Brain playing drums (while I like Herb more) is awesome and Mr Lalonde has a field day on guitar. Its a good album but its not their older stuff. So as long as your open enough to accept that and like the wierdness that is Primus then you will dig this album."
4,sorry,Listen i know they matured and got better but i just don't like this album by Primus as much as all the others. For an album you just pick up its a pretty good album. But for a Primus album (for me) it falls a little short.Stand out tracks are-Golden Boy-Shake Hands With Beef-Puddin' Taine-Kalamazoo
1,A Major Dissapointment For this Primus Fan,Why doesn't Primus rock anymore? This stuff just isn't as listenable as their early work. Quit telling silly stories and go back to writing music!
2,Primus does suck...,"this is definitley the worst Primus album, just beating out Tales From The Punch Bowl....Just not like the previous albums..."
4,The Brown Album---Not Exactly Gold,"Well, because of Brain, this album is not so great. The drumming, while still rythmically impressive, and not the least bit below primus standards, has a very distorted, overdriven sound to it that doesn't quite sit with the rest of the album. The sound style of the drum track is too noisy. Still, it's an overall wonderfully amusing album that at least deserves a spot in any true primus fan's album collection."
4,Ben's Max,This is a great product just wished it came in a med size bottle. The bottle is very small and hard to hold onto when you apply. Product greasy but eventually wears off. One thing to say it work great just like it says.
5,Powerful Rap Music,Powerful rap music with moving words. Not hardcore rap just up beat music with great bass. I love listening to this cd while driving in my car.
5,I LOVE KILO ALI Organized Bass,This is not one of those cd's were you can't hear a word their saying or if you can hear them it doesn't make any sense. This cd has easy listening music plus a message in each one of the songs. Kilo really showed out on this cd. If you don't have it you should definitely consider getting it. You won't regret it. I didn't...
3,"Good... Far from great, but good.","Which normally wouldn't be a problem if not for the premisethat this has been done. Many times before him.His lyrichs lackdepth, and his rhymes lack style. But there is one thing Kilo Ali does have going for him. Some killer beats. His Up-Beat bass stylings have a club like feal to them. Although potentially he has nothing to offer us, but a solid, if yet unreamarkable, good time."
4,This CD Iz Da Bomb!!!!,"I first heard the single Show Me Love and I had to go get the CD. Kilo Ali seems as if he had a lot of fun doing this album. My three favorites are Baby Baby, Lost ya'll mind, and Love in yo mouth. If you don't have it go get it."
4,New angles on women's health,It is refreshing to read a bood that actually tackles women's health problems which really are not taken seriously. Too many women suffer and at this time the medical establishment should take a more serious and alternate view on how to research and help women suffering with PMDD. This book has been an immense help and many kudos to Ms. Dell for tackling this subject.
4,Ignoble Royalty,"This is a review of THE BARON OF ARIZONA (1950) written and directed by Samuel Fuller. Vincent Price stars as master swindler James Reaves who spent years undercover forging and falsifyng documents with the primary goal of proving that he and his wife, played by Ellen Drew, were the owners of the territory, through Spanish land grants, that eventually became the state of Arizona in 1912.THE BARON OF ARIZONA is a little slow and officious in spots but that may have been done deliberately just to ensure the audience that this is the real story. And this based on fact film is supposedlyvery close to what happpened in a scam that started in the 1870s all the way to the early part of the Twentieth Century. Just for that fact alone,if it's actually true, I recommend this film and give it Four Stars."
2,Two stars for the idea only,"I should have known when the used copies were only a penny, but I persisted. Hey, this thing won a Hugo and a Nebula, right? Well the idea of the ringworld is interesting. The science of doing it is interesting. Everything else is boring.I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I normally will get sucked into a book and not do anything until I finish the book... not so with Ringworld. It was dull, the characters were entirely unbelievable, poorly described, I found myself not caring about them at all, and for the last 80 pages or so, skimming rapidly and even skipping pages entirely... and then I stopped 20 pages before it was done. I can't remember EVER not finishing a book.This book was absolutely horrid. Please don't read it. If you like the idea, go play Halo - it would be time better spent."
4,"Good sci fi, period","This is an adventure story of sorts, from earth to the ringworld system. There's a lot of science involved in this book as this odd team try to solve the puzzle of who built this ringworld, what happened to the occupants and how can they *leave*."
3,"Ok, but not what i really wanted","It was a good book, but I think that Niven got a little too caught up in depicting his world, and less time actually telling the story. The real story line doesnt begin until halfway through it. It also left me with a lot of questions that shouldnt be left hanging, (i dont intend to read any other ringworld books for a while) like what is meant by a ""slaver"" weapon? I found the hard science, that was supposed to be there, a little soft (with little or no explination). still the book is full of really good ideas, and i recomend it to anyone who is tired of bland ""me too"" science fiction."
3,"Worth a read, but overrated in my opinion","It is a good book. It is a short, easy read. The Ringworld is an Interesting concept, but I expected a better story than what I got"
3,Great fun but somehow lacking,"This book includes all the good and bad of Larry Niven: generally light-hearted and funny; creative and sometimes bizarre characters; interesting technology; difficult to grasp descriptions of aforementioned technology. Niven often fails to describe a given situation or object in a way that I can visualize. I find myself asking ""she did what where and with what?"" Ultimately, this novel is just a collection of little adventures on the Ringworld strung together by a molecule-thin thread (sorry, couldn't resist!). The ending is kind of one of those ""uh, gee, that's it?"" sort of endings and I was never moved or touched emotionally by this book. Nevertheless, it's a fun read with nice sprinklings of humor and adventure."
3,"not awful, just dissapointing","Found this book to be really disappointing, given how famous it is (at least among sci-fi fans). The premise is very interesting, but I found the writing and the story to be pretty poor.I've read two books by Niven, one of which was this and the other was The Mote in God's Eye.I loved the Mote in God's Eye, and would totally recommend it for someone looking to read something by Niven. It was co-written with another author--which I think helped out a great deal (my impression is that Niven is a great ""idea guy"" and just a so-so ""writer"")."
4,"A very different type of story, but intriguing and fun","I had a hard time figuring out what kind of stars to put on this book. Some of the characters were lame, a lot of the dialogue was cheesy, the technology is ludricuous...but I liked it. It wasn't torture, there were loose ends where I felt like I missed something, and dialogue that was hard to figure who was speaking, but when it wasn't confusing, it was really cool. Worth checking out for the idea of it and the adventure. There is something really likeable about the Kzin, so I think I might be picking up the Man-Kzin Wars books soon. This is such a short book, that I recommend it to sci-fi fans who don't rely on strong characters and just want to read about interesting technology. If you're in it for the characters...eh, maybe not."
3,Good Sci-Fi for the non-technical teen/young adult,"Over all I found the story interesting and Larry Niven did good research on technology. However, I probably would have enjoyed the book more if I was about 15-20 years younger. You can definitely tell that this was written during the Hippy era. I found the alien characters and Teela Brown to be 2-dimensional. You pretty much knew how they were going to react. Some descriptions of things (vehicle controls) are antiquated. I just couldn't see how people are still using dials, buttons and switches centuries from now.If you are looking for good in-depth Sci-fi with good characters try the Dune series or even William Gibson's work like Neuromancer."
5,What Sci-fi should be!,"This is a book that takes me right back to what got me into Sci-Fi in the first place. It has all the elements of classic sci-fi, a comic cowardly alien, a dangerous carnivorous alien, a drop-dead gorgeous sexy female companion and a world weary protagonist.They fly across the galaxy and find a huge constructed ring shaped world, which has descended into barbarity. They have some adventures, touching only a tiny proportion of the world.There is enough technology to be engaging, but not so much that you need a degree in quantum physics to follow the plot.What you are left with at the end is more questions than you started with. I can now daydream for days on end about what may lie elsewhere on Ringworld."
1,Disappointing; Niven could take some pointers from Asimov,"I'm glad I bought this with a gift certificate. Niven seems to be too busy trying to impress with his scientific knowledge to take time to entertain. I read 2/3 of the book and finally gave up. I don't really care about the characters and I don't really care about Ringworld or its inhabitants. He should follow Asimov's lead and make the science serve the story instead of the other way around. If you like hard sf that actually entertains while making you think, try Stephen R. Donaldson's 5-volume GAP cycle."
2,"If I looked Like Larry Niven, I'd hate women too","I don't understand how this book became a classic beyond a very interesting concept. The story itself is not very compelling, the science proves shoddy over and over under any examination and the characters are one-dimensional, unless they are female, in which case they have no dimension. Niven relegates all females into the role of bimbo, sex-slave, or vegetable. In fact, the main character is 200 years old and manages to have sex with every woman he comes into contact with. Do you get the feeling that someone is projecting? Niven seems to reveal himself to be a sad, sexist nerd who had one solitary good idea and just really lucked out."
1,What the heck was this?,"I heard all kinds of good things about this book, so I decided to give it a try. Wow. The characters are somewhat thinner than cardboard, the writing is childlike, and very, very bizarre. English grammar was not a prerequisite here. I read a novel a week, and this one ended up in the trash can about half way through. Strange, and yet somehow dumb."
1,Paucity of Imagination,"Ringworld is soooooooooooo big. Big deal.When I read sci-fi, I hunger for people and events unextrapolatable from the known. In short, things previously unimagined, rather scaled-up things known.From the foregoing, you might get the idea I hated the book.You'd be wrong.Instead, I was disappointed by it, which is worse."
1,Sexist Crap,"Oh, I could write a lengthy, detailed review. But it doesn't really deserve that. It's a book full of sexist crap that someone writing in the late 60's should've known better than to do. That it won the Nebula just makes me disappointed in the Nebula voters of 1970. :P"
1,Ugh... never again!,"I read Larry Niven's Ringworld on advice of a friend. I had heard of it and knew it was considered to be a landmark work of science fiction. I'm glad I didn't read it before I learned to love science fiction. I might never have picked up another.I found this story to have almost no character development. None of the characters were likeable and I could not have cared less if one or all of them died along the way.Niven spent pages describing mental ramblings of these annoying people and one sentence on the important plot developments. Sometimes I actually had to go back and find the one sentence that I had missed in order to find out how huge changes had happened.I found the ""culture"" that had been created for the Ringworld to be improbable as well as depressing. There is so much that could have been done with the premise that just wasn't.I won't read another Larry Niven novel."
1,A true disappointment,"I was unfamiliar with the term ""School and Library Binding Edition"" and was very disappointed in the product. I was looking to replace my well-worn original paperback with something more permanent, but this is a very poor reproduction copy the same size as the paperpack, with a cheap pasteboard binding slapped around it. Don't waste your money."
3,One way out of here,"Ringworld is a showcase of truly ""out of this world"" ideas. Niven has written many thoughtful and mind-expanding short stories, but the concept of the ringworld of this novel is spectacular. In my opinion Niven has always written his best work as a single author. That being said, his works form a monumental collection.Niven is best at ideas and following the path scientific would forge. Many of his characters are simplistic, but it doesn't matter. The ideas drive his work."
5,Halo before Halo,This book was absolutely fantastic. I came across this book only recently but I understand why its a classic that permeated science fiction since it's writing. The plot hums along inspiring grand mental imagery down to the smells and touch. For a long while this became the benchmark by which I measured science fiction novels. You wont be dissappointed.
4,Quite bizzare,This is a very strange book. But it is one of the most inetersting and outlandish stories I have ever read. I remember reading this book in middle school and I lost my copy. About 6 years later I played the infamous game Halo (Xbox platform) and was instantly reminded of it. I hope alot of kids discover this book because of the Halo series. It should be an instant classic to any sci-fi fan's book collection...
2,"I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't deliver","I've been told that I should read the other Ringworld books and that they would give me a better appreciation for this one, and so I probably will. The premise of the book is inherantly weak. I feel bad saying that, but it's just true. I feel that Niven had this cool idea for a world, physics-wise, and tried to throw up a story around it as an excuse to explore that world.The plot, what plot there was, just didn't go anywhere. The characters were so-so. It really may be much better in a larger context, and since I really like Niven, I'm going to give it that chance.I have to say that overall, I'd call this book fairly dull and unmemorable."
2,Good book but not for kids!,Thanks to the review noting the sexual content of this book. I had bought it for my 14 yr. old son on someone's recommendation but then decided to read it first. It's a shame that the author goes into so much gratuitous detail. My son would have liked the book but I think I'll wait 10 years to give it to him.
2,Great idea but very bad written,"The describe of the characters of the crew, their relations ships and motivation is incredible bad! I heard so much of this book and then it was a desaster! The points are only for the good idea."
3,A good book to take to the beach.,"I enjoyed reading this book, but was disappointed. The critters wereinteresting and their interactions logical.Great concept, but something was missingfrom the book: a plot, some point to it all.I really dislike an author who apparently writesa novel only as a setup for a sequel. I was leftat the end wondering what the conclusion willbe. Ah, well, it was a pleasant time filler untilBlue Mars came out in paperback"
3,Not Worth Reading,"The concept of the ""Ringworld"" in this book is really awesome. It's really too bad that better characters and plot couldn't be added to make this book good. The characters are difficult to distinguish despite their species, and I was rather shocked that there were no strong female characters in this; all women in this book are shallow and lifeless. The plot greatly resembles a comic book series; random event after random event, that never really tie together. All in all, this book is a waste of time, despite the concept of the ringworld."
5,Just Might Be The Best Science Fiction Book Ever,"I have read a lot of science fiction, and this is right at the top."
5,RINGWORLD: To Cool To Be True?,"Is it true that an author, in this case Larry Niven, can come up with a great idea for a book? It sure is! I happen to read this book at LEAST once a month. Ringworld is just like a big brew of pure sci-fi with a dash of romance. If you like sci-fi books, this is the one for you! Ever heard of puppeters? Probably, but most of the ones you know don't have 3 legs! This book is filled with aliens and you never know when when will be your friend one moment and turn on you the next. Technology is so advanced in this book, you'll never guess what happens next, you have to read."
3,Doesn't live up to premise.,"This book is just silly. As most reviewers have stated, the writing style is odd. After a while, I got tired of the author constantly refering to characters by their full names. That seems like a rookie mistake, but, who knows, maybe it was intentional.The concept sounded wonderful, and the cover sparked my imagination. But the book just couldn't live up to my expectations. The characters just weren't very interesting. I'm not sure I want to read the sequels, which I hear are worse."
2,A complete waste of time...,"This book is a fine example of the kind of scifi I don't like. It's completely nonsensical(is that a word?) and incoherent. It's like the author wrote out what he had dreamt or something exactly as he dreamed it. I suppose if you like science fantasy like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy then you would probably like this,, but fans of military sci fi or 'honest' sci fi I think wouldn't like it. I don't understand why it's considered some kind of great classic myself, it was awful. No offense Larry."
1,Bad science and fiction,"If you have ever wondered why science fiction have bad reputation outside the field, look no further. The reason is that genuinely bad books are hailed as science fiction classics. Rinworld is such a book and a reason why science fiction is laughed at.Ringworld is a gadget story. That is, a book whose only noveltry is some gadget, in this case the ringworld, otherwise characterised by bad writing and plotting.The science is wonky as well. The concept of genetic luck is of course unintentionally funny."
5,Famous for a Reason,"Recently I've noticed something interesting. The ""Greats"" of science fiction are so recognized for a reason. They are great, and this is one of the best books I've read in a long, long time. Not only are certain of the concepts refreshingly mindblowing, but it's also just a damn funny book! Read it already!"
5,Niven at his best,"After reading some other customer reviews to get a feel for the kind of people who'd even write one, I almost just quit. I can't believe the number of people who gave Niven's best work less than 3 stars...but then, there's no accounting for tastes. I urge you, if you've written one of those poor reviews or if you read them, to give the book a shot. The first hundred pages or so are, I admit, a wee bit hard to get through, but it really picks up right around there. A great book that will never stop being a classic, no matter what some would have you believe."
2,had to force myself to read the whole thing,"the style is choppy, the characters unbelievable and poorly developed and the story had nothing that held me in its grasp except the desire to finish the book. some of the ideas were interesting, but they were underdeveloped. for example, tell me more about the puppeteers. that could be some thought provoking science fiction. leave out the attempts at ironic contrasts of non-existent societies. they weren't even worthy of bad science fantasy. basing an entire book on a modification of the dyson sphere is no reason for praise. i plan on reading one more in the ringworld series to see if the writing improves."
2,Painful,"For me reading Ringworld was, in a word, painful. I understand that a good deal of this pain came from the fact that I am not a fan of ""hard science"". Yes, the concept of the Ringworld and Dyson spheres is facinating, I even like the idea of genetic luck, but I simply didn't enjoy reading 300 pages of pure technical description. I would have read that and more if there had only been some decent character interaction. There were glimmers of hope when the puppeteer's plotting came out, but no, the characters simply went their seperate ways and ignored one and other, as if Niven himself was afraid to concieve their emotions. Instead of focusing on these interactions we were left with the only character that did not seem to care who also did not want to talk about it and only contacted the interesting characters when he wanted to talk about the technical aspects of their escape. Overall I feel that there were the seeds of an interesting story, but they failed to flourish."
2,I can't believe this won a Hugo,"With a mysterious ringworld, this book had a lot of potential for action and intrigue. Instead, four characters drive their flycycles across an endless plain with nothing too exciting happening along the way. I just didn't care about the weak premise or characters. One of the main threads of the story having to do with luck is novel but ultimately stupid.This book was a huge letdown for me. I was going to put it down halfway through but thought that it's a revered book... maybe it's just slow to build and will pick up as details about the ringworld are revealed. I wish I had stopped.I am not tempted in the least to read the sequels, even though they may explain more about the ringworld; I no longer care."
3,"Ringworld, Yay! ..Niven, Nay.","This was my first Niven Book, and I have to say, what is all the hoopla about?The -CONCEPT- of ringworld is fantastic, and really sent my mind reeling, however I had to work very hard at forming the imagry as Niven's descriptions were lacking at best.The characters and plot were also great in THEORY, however Niven's execution and development was less then spectacular. In the so called 'climax' I found I didnt care about any of the characters, if they lived or died was of no concern.. they seemed as words on paper, nothing more.It must be that Niven's style just dosent suit me, as I enjoy other Sci-Fi Authors a great deal, but then again they have some descriptive talant that niven lacks.Overall It is a superior idea with inferior stylings. If you agree with this, I'd suggest Reading anything by David Brin, or Most of anything by John Varley.. (Varley's 'titan' trilogy is a lot like ringworld, but MUCH better IMHO)"
4,Intelligently designed book,"The construction of a ring shaped world is conceived and physically built by humans in the futures past. It's area is 3 million times the size of Earth's. It was ingeniously designed as an answer to overpolulated worlds. It is also noticed by the puppeteers, an advanced race of apparent cowards that are terrified by it's awesome presence. They choose a crew of 2 humans (one intelligent and one lucky) 1 kzin (a humanoid cat-like warrior)and 1 insane puppeteer to investigate it. A tanj perfect plan!This was a fun read. I am starting to see that Niven seems to tend to write stories that hint at a belief toward intelligent design. But his ideas of intelligent design are more scientific and less religious. His stories seem to politely scoff at those who worship diety. It's a very interesting concept."
3,Vivid Imagination,"Larry Niven is not that good a writer, but its anyway slightly fascinating to read about his sci-fi universe. In this book we visit the Ringworld, it's a massive artificial construction meant to support life in space. It's shaped like a massive ring around a star, this ring has got kind of the size that a planet would traverse in an orbit, so it's very big! In Niven's universe humans are just one part of the intelligent species in the universe, other species are pupeteers (a specie superior to humans in intelligence) and kzins (an animal like species, inferior to humans). The most interesting thing of the novel is that it proposes that luck is a genetic property, quite interesting."
5,SPECTACULAR,This book is incredible. It keeps you in your seat stayingup to all hours of the night just to finish your chapter.A masterpiece of Niven.
5,Incredibly Imaginative!!,This was an awesome read! I read it when I was in high school. I thought it was awesome then. This was the first Larry Niven book that I read. It turned me on to some of his other works.I compare the Ringworld series to the Rama series by Arthur C. Clarke.This series is just incredible. The whole concept of a civilization being so advanced that they can manipulate their solar system.... Wow!I plan on re-reading the entire Ringworld series one after the other....Buy/Borrow this book as soon as you can.....
5,Ringworld = Brilliant,"WOW pretty much sums up how I feel about this book! I read Neutron Star and was instantly hooked on Larry Nivens books. Ringworld is great, keep up the good work!"
4,A classic,"An entertaining look at a world that is a thin ring thousands of miles long. This is a classic and mind-blowing piece of hard science fiction, with the emphasis on the cool implications of the enormity of Ringworld. The characters tend toward the scifi cardboard cutouts familiar to the genre, but this is not to be missed for scifi fans.A better Niven book for the characters, although not the science, is Footfall. Also check out the Mote in God's Eye, a fascinating look at a totally alien world."
3,Interesting Fantasy,"An interesting fantasy... This is only the second science fiction book I've ever read, so maybe my relatively low rating is because I'm not really a science fiction fan... The alien characters almost defy imagination (The Kazin and the Puppeteer), but I have to complement the author for being relatively accurate with respect to basic physics... An enjoyable read, nevertheless..."
3,Fun romp through space,"The book does a great job of literally creating a unique world and throwing the characters into it. For imagination and creativity, it ranks pretty high.The writing is a little bit silly and the characters can be flat and annoying at times.Probably not really worth the time unless you are a big fan of old fashioned sci-fi."
2,"Good concepts, bad execution","While the ideas and concepts of the Ringworld are pretty good, the book overall is BORING. Niven comes up with a creative setting, but then you read page after agonizingly dull page waiting for just something to happen. And when things of interest finally happen, they're rushed. The societies and people the main characters encounter are poorly developed and feel like they were just thrown in. Ultimately, it's ok, but definitely nothing fantastic."
2,A disappointing read,"The idea, at least, was promising. Unfortunately, Niven writes poorly - certainly not at a level that would be acceptable in any other genre of literature. His alien characters felt more like B-movie human actors dressed up in bad costumes. I wouldn't recommend this to any adult, since there are far more literate works of science fiction, and I certainly wouldn't recommend this to young teenagers, since it is mostly sexist drivel."
3,Yamabushi's mini reviews XV,"lots of interesting places, concepts, and peoples, little tension or excitement"
2,What's the point?,"I listened to this book on audio book and was thoroughly bored. The story and plot were a thin covering on an overindulgence in trying to create future science that is completely unlike anything else. It's like the author was so interested in trying to ensure that every facet of life was so unique in his world that he completely neglected the story and character.To echo what some others said the crude sexual bits only detracted more from the story.The actual ring world is an interesting construct and an original idea, but the rest is just eh.I'd heard for years how great a book this was, now I just wonder if I read the same book everyone else read."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"I had heard about this book for years. All I had read of Niven's was the ""Integral Trees"" and that was horrible, but I thought I'd give this a try. I felt like I was watching a cartoon. The characters were plastic, the story was tedious and dull. I thought of all the stuff I could set on Ringworld and none of it was there; nothing was there. I'd like to know what happens in the sequel, but I don't think I can make through another page by this guy.P.S. The concept of psychic luck is so stupid I almost stopped reading the book every time they mentioned it."
2,All the hype -- where's the hoopla?,"Reading through the reviews, I guess I am not the only one who thought this book needed just a bit more to make it interesting. I DO read A LOT of sci-fi (with P.K.Dick as my unchallenged favorite) and did not get the enjoyment out of Ringworld that I was expecting from so much hype. His ideas are unique, but there was nothing in the novel that kept me up till the wee hours reading (e.g., I just wasn't captivated). Needless to say, I won't be finishing this series."
3,Not worth the price I'm seeing for it,"The Almeida part is badly recorded, muffled and dissonant sounding...the Baden Powell part is much much better. Both these men were superb guitarists and Im sure there are much better quality recordings out there."
4,Ghetto Supastar rules,"I haven't seen the movie but I have listened to the cd a lot. Ghetto Supastar is awesome but Mya messes up the song by her stupid refrain, but the rap part with Bulworth and ODB is tight."
3,This CD offers a hit single and little else,"Since a ghetto supastar single was not released, many people (including myself) bought this much hyped album. I was pretty disapointed with what was left after the few good songs I found on the album. For people really into rap, the Bulworth soundtrack is a solid buy if you got a few extra bucks but if you just interested in ghettosupastar, record it off a friend's CD and save your money until somthin better comes along"
2,some good tracks,"most of these songs are nothing special. the best songs are ""bulworth"" which was produced by the best hip hop dj,dj muggs of cyprress hill.also ""the chase"" by the rza and ""lunatics in the grass"" performed by b real and psycho realm.some of the songs are just straight up pathetic. like the tracks performed by ""d-fyne"",""nutta butta"",and ""dr dre& ll coll j"". this also has songs from different albums like ""joints and jams"" by the black eyed peas and ""run"" by cappadonna.aside from the good songs i mentioned, nothibg special here."
5,One of the Best Hip Hop Soundtracks Ever!!!,I know that most people don't really buy soundtracks but this one is a classic. Every joint up here is fire but the two I love the most are Bulworth and Lunatics in the Grass. Bulworth is produced by DJ Muggs and Lunatics in the Grass is produced by The Psycho Ward. Both are Ill. This soundtrack is worth checking out.
3,"Great stories, spare me the racial politics","I enjoyed Walter Mosley's ""Futureland."" The nine stories portray a bleak, ""Blade Runner"" future of economic hardship, biowarfare, political instability, and technology that both enslaves, and frees the human race. This book is filled with cool technology and plenty of food for thought for the amateur think tank member, medical ethicist, and sociologist that resides in every sci-fi fan.I did not care for the author's constant reminders that his hero's were black, and the villans and doofuses were white. This turned the otherwise great stories into a pedestrian cross between a bad ""Outer Limits"" story and an Al Sharpton speech."
2,FutureRacism,"While the style of the writing is good, and the idea is awesome (which caused me to buy the book), the race issue is very important to Walter. He purposely inverts old school white-black racist stereotypes, where instead of blacks are lazy, suspicious, and criminal-minded, the whites are. The black man in jail was put there unjustly, and he's innocent. This can very well be the case in real life, but this is not common. EVERYONE in jail pleads innocence and framing. Walter Mosley had a great idea for a story, but ruined it with his apparent hate of the white man. I regret that I funded his racism propaganda."
3,sad and bleak future that would've been better...,"if the 'blacks good, whitey bad' simplistic racism didn't get in the way. you see it starting already today, not black and white but with the growing underclass - blacks & whites, workers not just giving up their rights at the workplace door but beyond (smoke, high cholesterol, you won't be hired, home visits, etc.? ), govt telling you more and more what to do, less and less autonomy...and less ability to fight back. hey, die from being tasered, and its basically your fault. a vision of the future?"
3,A very different kind of future.,"This book presents a very dark and unusual glimpse into the future, but I found the pace, tone and presentation very odd and uncomfortable. I also felt that most of the future projections and many of the characters (like the infant boy genius) seemed highly unlikely and improbable. And from a PC standpoint, it appears most likely that the WASP will be the social outcast of the future.Walter Mosley's devotees must love his style and it has probably served him well in the past with non-techno works. I guess you'll either love it or hate it. But I notice even his fans refer to his work as ""flawed"". Hmmm."
2,Really tiring,"Is it possible for any african-american to write anything otherthen about being an african-american? Or stories about futureafro-americans and how they have always and will always betreated in what they have been programmed to believe is lessthen they deserve? I thought this book was science fiction.It isn't - it's another infinite lamentation about how bad the black man has it, in the beginning, now and forever. Frankly,if I ever read a book written by an afro-american that isn't racerelated I will bronze the book."
5,Romance and mystery tied together,"In a beautiful and deceptive way, Reynolds uses the disappearance of a daughter to introduce the reader into a world that is moved, disrupted and changed by the human heart. By the end of the story, it didn't even matter what happened to the daughter. I only had room in my heart for Ezra the sheriff, Imma the strange mother taking vigil on the courthouse bench, and the haunting yet silent love between the two. And Imma losing her daughter only to find her purpose in life . . . storytelling at its finest!"
2,Missing an 18-year-old daughter 35 years ago?,"And the bereaved mother started to sit on a bench awaiting her daughter's reappearance year after year. This IBSEN's scene might be okay for a Broadway play but highly unlikely for a believable reading. I was fooled by Reynolds for his latest wonderful ""PLAYERS"" and trying to cover up all of his old works, but could only find disappointments so far in this one and ""FRANKLIN'S CROSSING"". Both resulted in a bad taste"
3,OK,"It's really easy reading, it's about a girl and her friend who go on adventures with their horses."
4,fun...annoying...and good,"Hilarious and great! I put four stars because it's good to buy for a good laugh and a few really spectacular songs but it's not really worth much since a lot of it is just the fellows goofing around on their saxophones. If you want to hear saxophonists goof around for free, walk into a high school pep band room before practice."
4,Well done and informative,It is so difficult for me to write a review of such a horrible time in history but this is one to watch.
5,"Spectacular preformance, Outstanding script, Fabulous video","I love anything there is to do with the Holocaust and I've seen many movies, read many books on the subject. But this is one the the best vidoes on the subject I have ever seen! I love it! There is no better way to put it! Many times, Disney has been far below my standards of a good movie, but this is better that regularly high rated movie productions. Few books,or movies, successfully protray what happened to Denmark during WWII and before, if at all, but this beautifully shows how hard it was to stay alive in that time in the world, especially Europe. The actors and actresses were wonderful and convincing. This is a movie that.... I will be proud to have apart of my Holocuast book/movie collection. This is a must see for a person of any age. Thank you for such a tear-jerking, chair-gripping work of art."
4,"Great entertainment, yet more than that","This was a very captivating movie.A Danish family becomes involved in helping Jews. The son (Henrik) is in the resistance and keeps it a secret from his family, sure they would forbid him to continue because of the danger.The father, a doctor, decides he must do what he can to help the Jews when he hears of the news of the Germans coming to route out and kill Jews. He hides a family (friends of theirs) in the attic.There are many tense and action-packed scenes. The acting is great.I wish the people didn't feel they had to lie to save the Jews, though. (Corrie Ten Boom is a good example of someone who hid Jews and told the truth, being put in a concentration camp herself. What strong belief that is.)There were also a couple of kisses (if you worry about that kind of thing), but nothing more than that.Overall I give this movie a solid thumbs up and it is a striking example of the bravery of many people during the war."
2,Flimsy,"This is a remarkably flimsy cabinet. The construction is poor and the design is even worse. The whole thing wobbles despite correct assembly. Unless it's absolutely full the shoes will fall over and might fall on the floor in the back, where they are hard to get out. You can not store expensive shoes in here because they will get damaged. You also can not use it for everyday storage because when you take out a shoe to wear, the rest are unsupported and fall. I suppose it's okay to use for your seasonal stuff. Also, the finish is pretty near black; it's a very very dark brown. It is much too dark for ""regular"" cappucino finishes, so it will not match other cappucino furniture you might own."
5,Great Tape Set!,"I received this tape set as a gift and I love it! The tapes are inspirational, motivational, and affirming. There are nine basic principles and, although some of the principles are nothing new, they are presented in a new way. I prefer the term ""spirituality"" to Dyer's term ""divinity,"" but that is just a matter of semantics and, for the most part, I enjoyed his tapes very much."
3,It's OK - Decent Content,"I had the opportunity to borrow the 6 plus bonus cassette version of this program from a friend. Wayne Dyer is a great speaker, and the information he imparts on attitude, manifestation, vision, focus, holistic spiritual roles and the power of manifesting is great content. Unfortunately, the long story leads up to a relatively short and rudimentary meditation technique that, while probably providing the raw materials for focusing energies on manifesting your destiny, seems disconnected with the main topics of the other 5 tapes. In essence, Dyer says ""and here's the super secret technique we've been building up to for a few hours of cassette"" and then the content doesn't match the build up - either in terms of what it is or how he delivers it. It is worth listening to, and you may find the technique useful or somewhat powerful for you, but I was hoping for a more comprehensive tool kit than what Dyer delivered."
3,Queen's Melody Is Pretty Nice. 6.5/10,"With the debute of one of the most leathal female rappers in the game, there came fame and then Queen Pen disappeared. But I think Queen Pen's Melody is pretty nice. The album starts out with a wasted intro and the next two tracks that follow are also not very hot but at track 4 (""All My Love) the album picks up from where it should've started and then goes into the title track ""My Melody"". But the highlights of the album are ""It's True"", ""Girlfriend"", ""Get Away"" and the smash hit ""Party Ain't A Party"". I think the reason I am feeling Queen Pen's album is because she is so real and the music and quality is pretty good, most female rappers nowadays can't put out a solid effort and have one hit. I feel Queen Pen will continue to put out good material. Even if she doesn't drop another hot album this one is still a classic in my book."
5,All hail the Queen!!!!!!!,Queen Penn has to be one of my favorite female rap artist. Her flow is so unique! You can't help but to notice that Lil' Kim did copy her sound. Queen I love you!!!!!!!!!! Come back please!!!!!!!!
4,Came to Life,"I have owned this album since its debut in '97, but never really paid any attention to it. I just bought it because it was hot at the time--I liked a few singles. Just recently I popped it in my cd player and I was amazed at how much talent this lady posesses. Its a shame that her career didn't take off like Trina's did(she gets 5 wigeddy's and 10 whacks). Queen Pen is a top notch femcee."
1,SHE COULD OF DONE BETTER THEN THAT,THAT CD WAS VERY CORNY AND IF YOU PLAN ON DROPPING ANOTHER ONE PLEASE DO BETTER THEN THAT LAST ONE FOR REAL MY MELODY WAS THE ONLY SONG OFF THE WHOLE CD JUMPING A STRAIGHT WASTE OF MONEY NO WONDER YOU DIDN'T GET A GRAMMY THIS YEAR.......
4,Good read for believers and non-believers,"I was browsing through a book store and saw this book. I have read other religious books trying to explain the reasoning of God but this one being so short, it caught my eye. I am not a professed believer- I am still compiling information- and this book was very compelling. Not only does it give the view of a believer for any type of reader but it adds examples and comparisions. It is a very quick read- one sitting-, is easy to understand, and is not offending. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for another view from either side :)"
1,hard copy is probably better,"disappointed.the booklet is supposedly 64 pages but somehow it's just a few screens on kindle. I expected it to be longer, to last longer but clearly it didn't...the contents itself is of course perfectly fine but i should have gone to a bookstore and got it as a hard copy for $1.50 instead of $5 on kindle."
2,Not very special,I bought the House special cd at normans nj store. I was impressed with the list of local studio musicians on the cd. I was alittle dissapointed with the content. The musicans did not get much room to shine. But all in all it wasn't that bad. The cd was a little all over the place genre wise. Some things norman does very well and somethings seem to be a large stretch. I was very dissapointed when I went to see the band live and there was no live drummer or bass player just pre-recorded background tracks. I would love to hear the full band so I could make a solid judgement. All in all I would say pass on the house special and I will Chalk it up to experince
5,a live feel on some great songs,"All great songs by the Toadies with a live feel through the whole cd (especially the instrumental ""I burn"" all the way at the end). Great for any long time fan. And if You're just looking. BUY THIS CD, NOW!"
3,Nothing new here,"This EP is only necessary for collectors who must have every release. I am a huge Toadies fan, but Pleather leaves me flat. Rough recordings of 3 songs from Rubberneck, while interesting, have nothing new to offer. The two other songs are good, but they sound too much like other songs that are already on the album. There is an instrumental version of ""I Burn"" on a hidden track, which is also interesting, but honestly the album version is much better."
1,Toadies CD is a let-down...,Possum Kingdom was what I was after...it's by far the Toadies coolest tune. I listened to the others available and was not impressed. No wonder they never got any more publicity (or sales) ....only my humble opinion....Sonya Sky
4,Boyd Philosophy of Science,It is what I expected and wanted - a collection of essays on the subject. I am satisfied. The essays are excellent.
2,weak effort,"Although I'm a big fan, this album really disapoints. It starts off with a few really good tunes, thens peters out quickly."
5,the Allies,"This book arrived on time, and was in good condition. It was very reasonable priced, and I am happy with it. Thanks! :)"
5,Another Great Story!,"This is very good historical fiction--and it includes adventure, romance, drama, humor, emotion, and Christian values! The characters are very deep and real and interesting. The whole series is good!"
4,cinnamon nut coffee,"I love this coffee. I look forward to my daily cup in the morning. It has a wonderful flavor. I have tried other brands, but, they seem to taste so artificial. This one tastes real."
5,Best of both worlds,I rotate a pair of these in my wireless mouse. It is an earlier model that eats up batteries much faster than the new generation ones. I used to have to swap them out every 4-7 Days but these last for 3-4 weeks with heavy use. It's also true that they hold their charge when not in use. I've seen it first hand. I will not be buying any other Ni-MH than Hybrio. I came here looking to buy a bunch of them on the cheap and am shocked to see the price here. They are $TEN at Fry's every day! $Fifteen here at time of writing this. :(
1,You sent the Wrong Product!!,"The batteries you sent were NOT ""Hybrio"", they were ""Ultralast"", and they're terrible. They do NOT even energize the radio for which I bought and paid for the batteries. I have a set of Hybrio, and they work fine.What a waste!!!!Paul Miller"
4,wonderful batteries but be aware of voltage rating,"I got these batteries and they are wonderful for most purposes. But be aware that they are 1.25V, not 1.5, so if you have a device that needs the full voltage of 1.5V batteries, it will report low battery from the start. I have one, that's how I noticed they were 1.25."
3,Marrakesh Mission (not) impossible,"I bought this CD after being swept up by the Barcelona Files. This one is a lot more ""soulful"" or ""moody"" than it's sister CD. It took me longer to get used to it and still remains a CD I have to be in the mood for. It's the type of music you either love or hate. Several of my friends have given me odd looks when I've had it on whilst those who are more global minded have taken quite a liking to it with my best friend and mother dancing around her living room at a 50th birthday party. If you love the idea of mystic Marrakesh then this CD is for you...if not then I would warn you that it is some what of an acquired taste."
3,"Not bad, but lacking the depth I'd hoped to see","Ms. Slan's book will be helpful for those who are struggling to get more than ""who, what and when"" into their scrapbooks, but for those who are looking to create more meaningful journaling, this may not be the best choice for their dollar. She provides many examples of topics to explore and ways to write about them, but little in the way of developing the meaningful narratives that tell our descendents about who we were.For those who simply want a lot of quick ideas to include more writing in their books, this is a good resource. For those who want to truly leave a lasting story about themselves or their family, ""The Photo Scribe"" would be a better choice."
3,Just Ok,"Slan's book is Ok. No more, no less.This book is geared towards people who create scrapbooks, not people who want to write their life's story. Slan gives examples and advice on how to go beyond the who-what-where-when-why style. However, she doesn't explain how to write a long narrative, how to write more than ""the kids at the beach"". She doesn't show examples of her writing. Even though there are lots of pictures in her book, I am always amazed that while she is a professional author, she has very little journaling on her scrapbook pages! I know people that I think of as being fairly casual writers, if at all, and they write much more than she does. Certainly don't buy this book hoping to find new ways to incorporate journaling into your scrapbook layouts.The book that taught me to go beyond simple ""bullet point"" journaling is Denis Ledoux's ""Photo Scribe"". This book will not teach you how to write long narratives. It is a start... but only that."
5,Goody Hall by Natalie Babbitt,My daughter is 11 yrs old and does not like to read very much but she loves to read books written by Natalie Babbitt and Hank Zipzer.
3,"Back to Manhattan after this ""vacation,"" please!","I've recently discovered Ms. Van Wormer's novels and had read four others before ""Just For The Summer,"" which I followed with ""Any Given Moment"" (at last, Alexandra finds love!). Compared to her other multi-charactered studies of the worlds of publishing, broadcasting, etc., ""Just..."" seems to be shallow and focused on celebrity name-dropping. OK for a summer on the beach, but I hope the next books by this author take the L.I.E. back to Manhattan."
1,ONE OF THE SLOWEST MOVING BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!,"How did this book ever get published? It was the most boring thing that I've read this year. The entire book is about 474 pages. Just imagine wasting all that time for nothing. I believe that this novel should be considered general fiction and nothing more. There was some romance in it, but hardly any suspense. It just went on and on. The main characters went to about a thousand dinner parties and banquets. That took up about 75 pages in all! Nothing exciting happened at all until about page 250. But don't get me wrong, Laura Van Wormer is a good writer, because I'm reading ""Talk"" and loving it! Just trust me, save your money on ""Just For The Summer.""Brad Stonecipher"
2,Is this author working out of a cave or a former nun?,"I actually laughed in places when I read her stiff attempts at pretending to be of this century. I don't need a lot of sexy stuff to keep me hooked, just a decently plotted story (no go) and a main character I can care about. I would kill this girl if she were my houseguest. It's almost worth the slow read to see the word ""golly"" written about a gay liason and ""down there"" referencing, well...you know."
5,Amazing,This book has redefined the way i view science ficiton the writing is suberb and Trent is the man. Make sure to read emrald eyes first and catch the last dancer for a little bit more about his adventures.
4,"Pain to install, but good","I really enjoy having this on my 07 Focus. It was a pain in the rear to get the old intake system out, but after that, installation took about 10 minutes and I have noticed a small difference in performance and sound"
4,Priceless tool for healing,"11-year-old Leah Grier gives us a compilation of true short stories, fiction, and a medley of poems in her debut book, Healing: One Child's Journey. The book is subtitled ""Journey of a child healing from the death of her daddy"" and the majority of the pieces are a tribute to him and how she's handled his death...through her pain and grief.This is a nice assembly from a young talent and teaches the importance of expressing your feelings, finding comfort in something you enjoy, and successfully beginning the journey towards healing. It is a priceless tool for any child who has lost a loved one or for any adult responsible for helping a child understand death.Reviewed by Tee C. Royalof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,Expected product,"Product was received on time and good package, rubber material of good quality, excellent to replace old windshield glass seal of my cj-5 1979"
3,Un court roman aux couleurs fanées,"M. Mohrt relate la rencontre entre Martin, homme rveur et taciturne, mal à l'aise en société et Vicoria Hamil, femme exubérante. Durant cette rencontre dans un club londonien, ils évoquent leurs souvenirs datant de l'époque où ils se sont rencontrés quelques années auparavant sur la Cte d'Azur. Ce roman dépeint deux tres ne pouvant, pour diverses raisons, établir une relation intime, pas plus à la suite de cette rencontres à Londres qu'à l'époque à Hyères. Le récit manque de conviction et la caractérisation des personnages parat sans relief. Un roman qui ressemble à un bouquet fané."
5,With Highest Praise,"Kate Campbell has been a major music influence in my life since I was a little girl. She would sing in the church my family had attended, and all ears and eyes would be on her. She has a mystical presence about her in person, and it does come across through her music even on her CD's. I, too, am a songwriter, and like other songwriters, I have my favorite of whom I look up to.... I have all my life! KATE ""Kitty"" CAMPBELL, thanks for being a good friend to my family!"
4,"Could be a good product, if only!","This overbed table would have an excellent buy, had the top support bracket not been welded to the support post incorrectly, causing the table top to be out of level. Called Invacare about the problem, but they were not interested in correcting it. Other than the out of level top, the table is very stable and easy to adjust."
5,Beautiful clock,The clock is gorgeous - it hangs above the fireplace. Perfect for that spot. The clock matches the description exactly and would buy it again. Love it.
1,cheesy,"with the exception of a few Morrocan tracks untainted by BAD EURO-TRASH DISCO, this compilation is pretty awful.good rai used to sound dark and forboding, until it became very cheesy in the 80s (when producers started making it for the French).there is good modern Rai, just not available in the US or most of Europe (maybe you can find it in some countries, I'm not sure).if anyone has access or knows of an online shop, please leave a note here."
2,Not as warm as other base layers,"I bought these because I have another pair of Hot Chilly's winter leggings that are more like stretch fleece, and that's what I thought these were. But they're not -- they're kind of like Spandex only thinner, and not warm at all. I live in Yosemite where it gets very cold at night and I went out in these like I did my others, but unlike the other leggings these left me very cold and sorry I spent $50 for them. Be sure you know what you're buying. Thank goodness I have a couple of pairs of silk base layers to wear. I'll stick to silk from now on!"
5,Hot Chillys...love it!,I've ordered many items from Hot Chillys and have been very pleased with everything I received. The fit and comfort are outstanding while the added layer of warmth is a bonus. I like the added warmth without the added bulk. I highly recommend this product and the many other items from Hot Chillys!
2,"""you get what you pay for""","used to be that yamaha made a decent mid priced PA, but by the plastic construction and sound of these PA speakers they are obviously cutting lots of corners. i thought i might be able to use these for small coffee house shows and for rehearsal but they can't even compete with small guitar amp. oh well, as they say ""you get what you pay for"""
4,Payment of items with two credit cards,GoodI wanted to please tell me how do I use two credit cards in oreder same as the total amount and pay with b would split the two cards.Thank you very much for the helpYours sincerely
2,Good feature set but lousy reliability,"I like the size, sound (except the reverb, which Is pretty awful but fortunately I don't need) and feature set of this setup, but after owning it about two years now, I've concluded the reliability is just not there. First failure was a noisy fan, starting after a couple of months and which ultimately ended up cutting out entirely. I was able to replace this myself after finding the part, but it's clear they're using the most low budget fans they can find (and there are two mini muffin fans inside that aren't identical). And now the left channel speaker output has started cutting out, mostly only working when the unit is warmed up and even then somewhat intermittently. I'm not sure I'll bother to fix it at this point, and instead invest in something better. It seems to me both the mechanical parts as well as the electrical are ultra-low-budget consumer grade parts that just won't last."
5,The best sandals,These sandals are like walking on air. Just came back from vacation and walked miles without foot problems. Would buy 5 more pairs to keep all my future traveling experiences pain free.
3,not what I expected,I wasn't that happy with this shoe only because it looked pretty in the picture but seemed sportier when I had it on. It was too casual to wear with dresses/skirts. I ended up returning it.
5,The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse,The book is a gret companion I cn open it at any time and find an appropriate poem to match my mood.
2,Squash your fun,"What a disappointment. The pictures for the SquashBlox items all mention ""theme kit"". ""Kit"" making you think you have everything you need. They show children happily playing wiht their train, castle or animal. What they don't clearly show is that you are only purchasing the small accessory pieces, not the fact that you need to purchase the ""builder's kit"" which is not available as I can tell on amazon. I was so embarassed after sending this train kit to a friend to find out he only recieved soft wheels and other small parts, not the big panels needed to put it together. Do not waste your money or time."
4,Remembering 1683,"John Stoye has created a masterful piece of scholarship in this exposition. This is the work to consult if someone is looking for a rich amount of detail on the siege, including diagrams of the siege works and a good collection of maps rarely found in other books. It is a sometimes difficult read and could do better in terms of sequencing the dates of events.The author could also give the reader a more satisfying summation of the significance of the siege. I would also have liked a greater amount of information regarding the decision making behind the Muslim council that agreed to the invasion and a clearer total of the numbers of troops involved. But, on the whole, Stoye does provide a wealth of information in most other areas. --C. Wayne Dawson [...]"
1,Beware,"Misleading title... These cuts are not the original recordings (with only a couple of exceptions). Instead, these are mostly live takes, and not very good ones at that. Poor liner notes to boot. The sound quality is pretty bad too."
2,Disappointing,"Given the amount of duplication in the Sir Douglas CDs that are available, I was less-than-excited about the prospect of yet another CD. I bought it and was stunned that many of the cuts were live. So, there was a pleasant surprise regarding the prospect of a live album of their hits. In fact, I loved the first cut, but the sound quality was terrible. Also, it wasn't the best performance by such as great band. Essentially, it is a legal boot leg recording, so buyer beware."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD. INSTEAD OF A ""BEST OF"" COMPILITAION, THIS IS MOSTLY POORLY RECORDED LIVE CUTS AND CERTAINLY NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THEIR ""BEST OF"". MISLEADING TITLE AND NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, SINCE I LIKE THE SIR DOUGLAS QUINTET, BUT NOT THIS ALBUM."
5,Best Product..!!,I like to say this is the best product what I found in amazon.com I heard this CD it sound is very quality and this is better. I catch all tips in this CD. I must sure if I got anger definitely I can control it.
3,Very Effective Tips!,CD was simple to use with short concise information. Abe really get to the root of the anger control topic with some very key points. I would recommend this CD for anyone looking to help them control their anger with some quick effective tips

3,Wimpy,A decent chain for a pocket watch or something small. Not a thick chain for heavier items or if you are going for a bad ass rocker look.
5,The Best Book,"The book is so cool, really neat story.Peony Park has such a neat place in history!I look forward to going to the new Peony Parkthis summer."
5,Give this book to every teenager you know!,"So much excellent advice for anyone, any age. Just leave this book sitting around the house, and someone will pick it up, read just a few pages, and benefit from the insights. Worth every penny!"
4,*~ Some helpful Tips in this Book*~,"I liked this book~ It was easy to read in 101 sections divided up. The only thing I think this book lacked was a teenager's point of view. Unlike Chicken Soup, Teen Love, and Teen Ink, a grown man is writing these tips. He had some good advice but I think some of the tips couldve been made fresher by having some kind of teenager input. Other than that theres many valuable lessons in this book and Richard Carlson did a good job (even if he is grown and not a teenager himself.) I suggest you read it! I'm sure you'll get some kind of help or advice outta it~"
5,great book for teens,great book for teens when they don't won't to ask parents for help with issues and realize they are not alone with their problems.
4,great life skills lessons,"I use this book and it's great life skills lessons in my classroom of middle schoolers. It's easy to relate to real life experiences, and I can easily create writing responses from each lesson."
1,Not written for teens and it's very boring,"I am very dissapointed in this book. It is intended for a teen audience, but is written for an adult audience. I read it to several teens individually to get their opinion. One student commented, ""It's obvious he doesn't have any teenagers."" Try the library before buying this book I wish I had."
1,"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff for Teens? More like ""2 common sense tips with 100 examples""","This may be one of the worst self-help/advice books out there. After reading this book the only ""tips"" I got out of it are : When your mad your not happy, when your mad you can make bad decisions, prioritize your tasks.... anyone with a HINT of common sense should be able to know those tips. The fact that this book had the most stupid tips did not get me as mad as how the author wasted hundreds of pages. Each chapter is only about 1-3 pages long and even that is too long. Each chapter focuses on one tip, they state the tip and give one of the most corny/ fake examples they claim to be real. It would've been much better if they listed the title of each chapter in a list and gave it to you instead of making you buy this whole book"
3,some good advice,"As with all self-help style books, I'm inclined to come at it with a wary eye. However, this book has some good information. Some of it is stale or a bit sentimental, but some is very practical and can make someone look at something in a whole new light. ""Become Button-Proof"" is a good example; imagine how much easier it would be if other people through thoughtless or undesireable action, couldn't ruffle your feathers? And it's really not that hard in practice."
1,Truly Saddening...,"I was amazed to find that everyone here found this book to be entertaining and funny-- It's a terribly sad commentary on the lack of respect for a generation (in fact, multiple generations) of women who devoted themselves to their families and attempted to live their lives in a world that often allowed them only rigid roles and often, little choice in how to live their lives at all. Many of those women were brave and strong and devoted in spite of having to give up their own dreams, and sometimes their creativity and individuality. I think that it's a sad commentary on the current generation that they have apparently so little knowledge, understanding and respect for those women--who, in fact, bravely led our generation out of that bondage to the freedoms that we enjoy today."
5,Hilarious-- please reprint it!,"This book is a hilarious commentary on being a Good Mother in the pre-feminist 50s. Women were expected to juggle kids, laundry, clean everything that wasn't nailed down, make a beautiful dinner, meet the hubby at the door with a cocktail, and dress in heels and pearls for dinner-- all the while with a smile on her face and keeping her mouth shut. My mother was a 50s housewife and mother, and her college's motto was ""gracious living"". She did it all beautifully but was glad when she didn't have to do it anymore. She absolutely adores this book, and passes it around to all her friends. Please re-publish this book, so I can find more copies to give to my friends!"
4,One book you will need for Windows programming...,"This book did well to present Windows graphics programming, and since Windows is a GUI system you do not have to be doing Graphics application to buy this book. There are many cases where the author used some API which are not supported on Win9.x and you might have problems trying to run some of the samples on such systems. However, if you wish to study graphics programming under Windows, there is no better book. A lot of the samples are very practical and you can use them directly in your applications. Besides the author promptly answers all my questions anytime I run into trouble.It is not perfect but you cannot do without it."
4,Way ahead of its time!,"I bought the record in the late 70's but wore it out. Glad to see the finally released it on CD. This is a very cool fusion/new-age sound. Outstanding tune would be ""Crossing The Line"".Probably the 1st Supergroup, featured Steve Winwood, Al Dimeola, Michael Shrieve, Klaus Schulze & Stomu Yamashta."
4,An oldy but a goodie,Fairly unknown work features Steve Winwood on vocals and other famous and talented musicians. Music by Stomu Yamashta - it's a combination of electronica and pop. The pop sections are wonderful. The electronica is not something that draws me so I can't really comment.
4,Still A Treasure!,"4 1/2 - This was one of my favorites back in the day. I'm glad to have rediscovered it. It's some of the best what we used to call ""head music"" ever recorded. If ever there was an album that begged for headphones, ""Go"" is it!Stomu Yamashta has assembled quite a band here. The collective talent is incredible. Al DiMeola never shies away from a chance to really let loose on guitar. For me though, it's Steve Winwood that really shines throughout this set.""Go"" is some of the most intense, satisfying, ethereal music you could hope to come across. Feed your head!"
1,Seventies New Age,"I bought the album because Steve Winwood was part of the project. Sometimes these things do not work out. The album is dated. Instrumentals tends to go in music segments playing rythms and melodies then changing to another segment. There is no hook, there are no verses. You hardly know when each song ends the ahte next one begins. I still think Steve Winwoods music is timeless. His music from the sixties still sounds good today."
1,I SHOULD HAVE DONE MY HOMEWORK.....,"I saw this in the bargain bin of my local music shop and picked it up for less than 5 bucks. Should have left it there. I was under the mistaken impression that Richie ""Drumhead"" Stevens ( Master of Dub and a member of the Spacemonkeys team that remixed the Gorillaz cd) is on this. He's not. I should have read the back of the disc a little more carefully, or done my homework. I had no idea how old and how bad this really is. This music just blows. Painfully dated, hopelessly derivative, and completely uninspired."
4,Sweet sugarcane / Ecclectic album,"This album is one of the best to come out in mid 90's. Sugarcane is one of the most catchy tunes of all time. The whole album is outstanding every track rocks with a little synthpop throw back to the 80's. A very unique album to come out in the 90's when the sad grunge movement was on the verge of ending. This cd is very upbeat sound & ecclectic mixing hip hop sampling with britrock & electronica. Standout tracks ""Blowing down the stylus, Sugarcane, We are the supercool, & Let it shine. The production is done very well. One of my favorite albums of mid 90's & sugarcane is one of my favorite songs. Solid band & recommend checking it out."
5,awesome,"This is one of my favorite albums. I think they sound like Oasis with an electronic edge, but not enough like Oasis to suck like Oasis. Sugarcane is a fun song, and the rest are great too. I can't believe they're not super-famous yet."
2,Useless for learning to play Tabla,"This set of two Tabla DVDs serve more as a show than as a learning tool. Lot of spoken words describing the Tabla ""Bols"" and ""Taals"" but no written words are displayed. The ""teacher"" just says the taals and then plays them quite fast; therefore they are very difficult to follow. I have played Tabla before, and currently taking lessons with an expert Tabla teacher, yet I have found these DVDs useless as a learning aid. Also, often sound and video signals are not synchronized, so the hand movements either lag or lead the sound. I would not recommend this set of DVDs (Vols 1 & 2) as a learning tool."
4,Bucking the Sophomore Jinx,"A great follow up album to Jews and the Abstract Truth (a pun on the Oliver Nelson album ""Blues and the Abstract Truth"" on Impulse), this album avoids the trap of sophomore albums simply retreading ideas from the original, while also escaping the impulse to venture too far from the qualities that made the first a success. For all this, it does not manage to match the freshness and energy of their first release, but is a far sight better than the rather tired (and shorter) third album, ""Kabalogy"". The personnel remains the same, with the exception of the bassist, and all acquit themselves well. The idea of translating traditional Judaic chants into music (reverse-onomatopeia?) is interesting, but also somewhat interrupts the flow of the album. I am not familiar enough with the original chants to comment further about the success of that experiment. In all very good album."
2,"Nice looking, but cheap.","I was very excited about receiving this item, as I had scoped it out for a few years now looking for something a little spicy to wear to a costume party. I received it just a few days ago and thought it looked and fit as well as it did in the pictures. The fact that it loosens by the ties in both the front and back allows it to be put on easily.HOWEVER, I have tried the dress on twice now and while tying the string on the front the second time, the very top grommet fell out of the material. Of course, this does not instill a lot of faith in the other grommets maintaining their rightful place on the dress, so I'm extremely disappointed. Especially since I likely won't be able to wear it to the party I purchased it for without fearing the material with rip without the grommet.Needless to say, if you plan on wearing the dress once or twice, it's a decent purchase...but don't expect it to last much longer, or you'll be disappointed like me. :("
4,Baffling But Good!,"This was a good book...very entertaining. This series amazes me somewhat because I lived in Long Beach where Charlie lives and in L.A. a few years ago, and never met any characters quite like she has in her stories. I must have led a sheltered life. Or Marlys exaggerates somewhat. Whatever! This book kept my attention til the end."
5,Millhiser has created a very likable protagonist in Charlie.,"Charlie Greene has perhaps the most annoying daughter in the mystery field. And I like her because she obviously loves this annoying brat. An interesting setting, good characters, humor, a murder and a soupcon of the paranormal. It doesn't get much better than this"
1,"In a word: ""Worthless!""","Here's the bottom line: The book has an accompanying CD that delivers pre-developed applets while the book itself merely describes what the applets do. The concept is good. You don't have to spend time developing. However, you can find these applets on the web and you won't learn A SHRED of Java applet programming. You can download an un-jarrer (to decompress the resulting jar files that are created) and a decompiler (to get to the source code of the class files). That doesn't help because you land up with code that's hard to understand (for example, it's hard to find where some of the extended classes come from). The book gives a plug-in that you can use to change SOME of the characteristics, but it's painfully inflexible in general. Therefore, what's the purpose of the book?"
1,Interested in programming? This book isn't for you...,"If you're interested in the actual programming of Java then this book is not for you. I found it to actually be worthless and definately not helpful to me at all. It does include some applets but if you want applets you can find the same things online and not pay a dime. If you're still interested in buying this book E-mail Me, I'm willing to sell it for a reasonable price."
3,Misleading album title,"Huge EP would be a pleasant treat for fans of this accessible industrial group since the latter half is full of remix material. A certain inertia arises when tracks wear out their logical extensions yet press on, but beneath the datedly hip sensibilities lie some pretty compelling electronic undercurrents."
2,Ouch!,"If it weren't for the excellent last remix of Radio Babylon by the Orb, this disc would be long gone. Tacky tracks abound, though there may be a few ""flashes of brilliance"" here and there."
2,"""A snare and a delusion...""","...as noted in other reviews here, hydrogen is simply an energy carrier (not a source) -- like a battery.Here is an interesting quote:"" ...hydrogen offers little to no potential to produce oil security and reduce climate change risk in the next 20 years. (Changing the infrastructure for using hydrogen fuel cells for transportation) ...is a many decades undertaking.Hydrogen fuel cells for transportation, are in my judgment, a snare and a delusion...""-- James Woolsey, former CIA Director."
5,Great Read,"This is a fantastic book. Well researched and Rifkin goes into more then just energy but also into geo politics, history, and the environment. I read this book when it first came out and Rifkin is proving to be a prophet as everything he said is coming true even before it was fashionable. From war to hyperinflation, to global warming this book really lays it out and is very thought provoking."
1,Defective toy,"All the other reviewers are absolutely right. The toy was defective right out of the box. It's a cute idea, but needs to be totally redesigned."
2,There are better ways to spend your money...,"My 4YO son got this for Christmas. After reading the other reviews, I wanted to take this back to the store, but alas he insisted on keeping it. It is not as bad as the other reviewers say, but it is rather poorly designed. The cans do stay up. My son can pull the trigger by himself, though I don't see how because it is difficult for me. The noises are repeatitive and irritating. And once the cans have colapsed, it is very difficult to pull them straight again and my son cannot do that on his own. To pull the cans back straight, you have to pull very hard and twist ever so slightly. It takes several tries for me to set each one back. I hope he gets bored with it soon. :-("
1,Don't bother buying this toy!,"We received this toy for Christmas this year. It was such a cute idea, and my 4 year old son was so excited to play with it, that we opened it right away. As you will see all the other reviews, he didn't even get to pull the trigger once. It jammed, and uncle took the gun apart to try to fix it, to no avail. I hadn't read the reviews; just took it back to Toys R Us to try to get a new one. Good thing I didn't find it. After coming online to try to order it, I read the reviews, and realized ours wasn't just a one-time lemon. I wish it would have been made better because the idea is great. Oh well!"
4,Writer's Little Instruction Book - Craft & Technique (Writer's Little Instruction Book),"This a cool little book with thoughtful suggestions on writing. It's laid out in a pleasing and logical manner. Unfortunately I bought it to help with songwriting and it's not that helpful. It's better for novels, screenplays and more prosaic endeavors."
2,Not much action,"If you're looking for nautical adventure in the age of sail, you will be greatly disappointed in this book. It starts out pretty well, and Marryat certainly knows whereof he writes. But the last hundred pages of the book are a real waste, as Marryat seems intent on grinding out a romance novel, presaging not Alexander Kent, but Barbara Cartland. I'm sorry I bought it."
4,Offers more than expected!,"Suprisingly cute story with more heart than the premise might indicate. An obsessive fan finds clever ways to steal personal items belonging to a famous movie star that died young. There's actually a heartfelt reason for her obsession and a disturbing secret that is waiting for her behind closed doors. [...] Drawn and written for girls, but with plenty of smart-alec humor and intense theif action that could attract a wide audience."
4,You do not need to buy a loom to begin needleweaving,"A book left over from the crafts era when everyone was into various fiber arts and there was a craft center to every town and village. Now with the dwindling craft centers and fairs, we are in the age of kilts and even paint by numbers has disappeared.You can keep the skills alive until they are once more needed with this vary dated book of Needleweaving which seems like a combination of macram wall hangings, primitive tapestries, and quasi Indian art.Most of the pictures are monochrome with a few color plates. The Jacket design is by Al J. Reagan. It is of several thread Mandalas over a desk."
2,"Makes a Few Good Points, but Mostly Common Sense","This book was required reading for my Ph.D. program in psychology. However, it was not very useful to me. It makes a few good points as to what you should look for in a mentor and the kinds of questions that you should ask, but overall, this book was not particularly useful. It's pretty much common sense. To summarize this book, you should: ask a lot of questions to a potential mentor as well as other individuals who have worked for him or her. You should not: procrastinate, sleep with your mentor, or work with someone just because they're famous. Honestly, that's about all I got out of this book. I'm not trying to be mean, but for someone like me, this book did not tell me anything I didn't already know."
3,"Good book, but outdated 14 years later","We used this book for a graduate course on High Energy Astrophysics. As I recall, there were a fair number of mistakes (like ""Fermi's Exclusion Principle""), but overall I found it quite informative. However, modern astrophysics is rapidly changing, and you should not spend money on a book that is so out dated on many topics. Buy something new and borrow this one from the library if you get the urge."
5,callipygia600.com,"Having bought Studio MX 2004 because I wanted the easiest way to integrate graphics with DreamWeaver, I struggled and struggled to use Fireworks. I use Photoshop, but read how great Fireworks was and wanted to try it. I found that it's HELP is terrible, and not very useful to new users. Then I found Sandee Cohen's book, and all is now clear. This is a great book, walking the user systematically through how to use Fireworks, and emphasizing the ease and simplicity of keystroke shortcuts. Very highly recommended."
5,This album kicks ass!,This is one of the best albums I have heard in a very long time. Every song is as good as the rest. This album is definetely a must buy!!!
2,Title Misleading,"My 9 year old son loves baseball. We as a family watched this whole video together. Out of the 90 minutes, approximately 15 minutes was actual bloopers. The rest consisted of interviews. This was a disappointment."
2,Low on Bloopers,If you are looking for a video that has back to back highlights of bloopers and blunders - this is not it. A lot of interviews made the highlights drag and this was just mildly entertaining.
5,Heartwarming and delicious!,"I loved ""Giving Thanks"". It is not only a comprehensive history of Thanksgiving and collection of everyone's favorite recipes (and then some), it is also a beautifully written feel-good book. Somehow the authors have managed to capture the love, spirit of connection and gratitude for life that surrounds this holiday and make it readily accessible to even this solitary reader. I highly recommend it!"
5,"Truly, truly amazing.","This CD knocked me out the first time I heard it--it was love at first listen. I can't see why anyone would compare it unfavorably with Cheese or Frizzle Fry. It's dark, honest, rhythm-driven. It shows a band that is growing musically and lyrically. There's always something more lurking under the surface. Diamondback Sturgeon is the weakest track, but what would a Primus album be without a song about fishing? This CD is one of their best, absolutely, and one of my favorite CDs period."
3,Warped mechanics to fill your belly,"3 1/2Demento-funk which practically begs the secure to hold their head steady, fueled by Les Claypool's masterful off-kilter bass sonics and wonderfully kooky trio interplay. Pork Soda can easily be seen as the last disc where the three members were totally in their creative element, sadly providing a sound that really has not been explored since. Encroaching, overriding goofiness which would plague Claypool's later years first takes root here, when the band was still riding out some sort of singular creative plateau but lacking the album cohesion STSOC had."
3,DISAPPOINTMENTIND COMPARED TO FRIZZLE FRY AND SEAS OF CHEESE,"After hearing Sailing The Seas Of Cheese and Frizzle Fry, I tried out Pork Soda. I was hit with disappointment, not because it's a bad album, but it just pales in comparison to the mentioned two albums. Still a good album."
3,this isn't primus,"pork soda is dark and greedy and mean not primus at all. this is what started primus' tough years. although not the best primus album, not even close, it still is primus and has got some great tunes."
2,I can't get into this.,"I have heard some Primus stuff before, (The more played stuff, eg. lacquerhead, tommy the cat, jerry was arace car driver.) and was expecting a much more upbeat sound. This album just bores me. One track (ol' Diamondback Sturgeon) sounds even country-ish. This album is not worth the ...i dropped on it at a used record shop. It didn't live up to the funky as hell metal that I became instantly hooked on upon first hearing primus. It's just too slow and mellow."
3,Like to see these guys do something serious,"This band grows tired after awhile...silly, silly and more silly. That's a shame because these guys have some real talent... Ju Ju says they got a sense of humor...yea but it gets old fast...are they comedians or musicians????"
3,"Mostly mediocre, but some brilliant gems","I used to really love Primus. Their first three albums were truly fun, funky, rockin, and innovative. But with Pork Soda, I think that the joke got a little old. Claypool always had a sort of hokey humor about him, and on this album(AND DEFINATELY on his later albums) it started to be a bit too much. I also feel that the music became a little too monotonous and self-indulgent. That being said, there are some great tunes on here, like Nature Boy, DMV, and the percussion solo Wounded Knee. But extended boredom jams like Hamburger Train, and silly goofs like My Name is Mud really prevent this album from being the classic that Frizzle Fry and Sailing the Seas of Cheese are."
1,I was expecting a lot more from this album...,"I listened some others of their album, and I can say that the band got VERY talented musicians. I really like Primus, but on Pork Soda, it's like they were all drunk ; there's almost no melodies, no cool base tricks, the ambiance is dark and not interesting, etc... I don't even find one positive point to this album ; the others are by far, a lot better.no more than [terible] ... DON'T BUY IT !!!"
5,Wow,What can you say about Primus?!?! I mean thier music is completely unique....they dont adhere to any scales/modes etc. They have thier own language and they do it superbly. Claypools bass playing is as pronounced as ever....but the tightness and musicianship of the other band members cant be overlooked. Fantastic.
3,Last good Primus album,"Primus is one of my favorite bands, so the fact that you can start to see their creative decline on this album is dissapointing to say the least. However, the album itself is still very good. Not nearly the brilliance of Sailing on Seas of Cheese or Frizzle Fry, but a good listen nevertheless. Still better than Tales From the Punchbowl, which I bought basically just for the song ""Southbound Pachyderm.""Standouts:""Welcome to This World""""DMV""""Natureboy"""
5,Welcome to Pork Soda,"When I first bought this album I didn't knwo what to expect. This was mostly due to the fact that I had no Primus albums and had never heard their music before. I had heard they were good and had a good bass player so I thought what the heck and bought it. When I started listening to it I wasn't sure what to think of it. the bass playing was great but I couldn't really understand the lyrics and some stuff didn't seem to fit on the album. Then after a while it started to grow on me and I started liking some songs which progressed into alot of the songs on the album. I have to say that I like the album now more then I ever thought I would. This is one that has to grow on you but it will only be able to do that if you give it a chance. I mean come on, it's Primus."
5,Good times were had by all,"Its always been difficult to decide which Primus album I like better. On one hand, Pork Soda is much easier to get into than Seas Of Cheese but overal, Seas of Cheese has better craftsmenship. But the plain and simple fact is that both are two of Primus's best albums.Pork Soda expands the plans laid out by Seas Of Cheese(ie incredible funky slap bass, fuzzed out heavy guitar, and drums to die for) and tries to one up it. The end result shows some of Primus's best material. Not all have the same level of quality(Seas Of Cheese wins probably wins based on consistent level of quality), the great songs on here are true jems.The simple fact is, you know Primus, you know about what you are getting. I'm not going any further into the review because its not nescessary. Just get the [fine] thing!"
2,Too busy,I was hoping for more music - there's just too much storytelling for my and my kids' taste. We love the Beethoven's Wig series and were hoping this would be similar.
2,Excellent Album... bad download,"We've just heard about this series and ordered a download quickly because we were so excited. Trouble though is that the downloads cut off sentences at the end of each track... like #5, #10, #14, #16. It wasn't made for mp3 so it really interrupts the storyline, very frustrating to try to listen to the whole story. Amazon was super fast to refund me for the mp3 album, and I've spent the 3 extra dollars to have it hard copy now. 5 stars for Amazon, 5 stars for the album, 1 star for the mp3s."
4,Engaging,"The production value in this series of children's stories is well done. My six year old daughter has listened to these various titles since she was three and has a love for classical music and can even recognize compositions.As a song began to play in the book store one day, she commented: ""I do think that's Vivaldi."" She was five at the time. Mozart's Magical Adventure was a gift from Santa and gets played often.Educational & entertaining, parents will enjoy these too."
4,Enjoyable by all,A friend of mine got this for her son about 3 years ago and he's still listening to the stories. Its calming and interesting. Its great in the car. The story goes along with the movements of the piece and really brings classical music and a great story to children. I now get this for all my friends with babies and small children.
3,Ok classical music CD.,This is a pretty run of the mill clasical music CD. The first track sounded a little rough to me (sounded like harmonica and recorder -- I was not overly impressed) but the other tracks seem more par for the course.
2,A good music theory book? I think not,This is just a terrible book for learning beginning theory. It's just not good at explaining things. I would recommend it to people already with a decent knowledge of theory. Picking this book up if you want to learn on your own is a waste of money.
2,Difficult book should be read backwards,"The best part of this book are the points for review at the end of each chapter. Study happens best when starting with these points, and then reading their elaborations in the chapter itself. It's difficult to read, and boring, but informational."
5,Excellent.,"Superb acoustical work from the heart and soul of an extraordinary musician. This would not surprise any Genesis or Hackett fan, since he was one of the musical brains of that group during its best era, around the seventies.Every early Genesis fans would love Hackett solo works, for he followed the proggresive path the band opened since Selling England by the PoundThis imported edition has CD-ROM capabilities with a bunch of information and several mp3 tracks. Don't miss it!"
5,GOLD!!!,"I'm a child of the Golden Age of TV and am spoiled to this date - I love a well-written sitcom. I grew up on Mr. Ed & the Beverly Hillbillies but never fully appreciated Mr. Ed until recent years. This is, by far, the best comedy from that era - even actors from the Beverly Hillbillies appear in some episodes, along with a host of others from Mae West to the Dodgers of that day! Ed was a hot mess & hilariously funny & the ensemble cast was splendid. I'm loving my Season 3 collection & will be ordering Season 4 next! Thanks Amazon! Andrea Morris"
3,"Great collection, but not bound well","We purchased this collection for my nine year old son who loves all things Calvin and Hobbes. He already owns every paperback collection of comics, but this seemed too nice to pass up.After a few days of non-stop reading the books cover to cover, we saw that the binding of the books was coming loose from the spine. The glue used to bind the collection seems very weak, and was not able to hold up against the love of a young boy. A few squirts of shop glue into the spine and it is stronger than ever now, but I feel for the price we paid for the collection it should have been bound better than just a little weak glue.The quality of the printing is wonderful and having everything dated on each page is very nice. Just be ready for these books to fall apart on you if you plan to read them often."
3,Immediately damaged,"Even at the reduced prices, no set of books this expensive should arrive with the glue holding the pages cracked, broken, and flaking away. I received this as a gift, and I'm sorely disappointed."
5,Worth the price and weight,"I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard Calvin and Hobbes fan, but I'm certainly a big fan. I have about 6 individual books and I've even designed a T-shirt for my freshman dorm with Calvin and Hobbes as the two party characters (don't tell Bill).So let's skip what C&H; is about and talk about this collection. Best thing about it is that you get everything he's ever done, in one shot, in chronological order. Each strip is dated, in order, 6 B&W; followed by a Sunday color splash. It's great to sit down and read one by one, kinda like going back in time.Binding is good, not super, but good Chinese quality bindings. Pages and paper are amazing, print quality is awesome. I do wish they'd put a bookmark tassel to each book... I hate bookmarks. Other than that, the only other draw back is the weight and size. It is HEAVY and HUGE!Otherwise it is all I'd hoped for! Fun and awesome collection."
5,Fantastic Set!,"Calvin and Hobbes is one of the best comic strips ever, and this collected hardcover set is probably the best way to experience Bill Watterson's tales of a boy and his imaginary tiger."
5,Calvin and hobb set,I ordered this product for x-mas for my husband and he was so delighted about it. The package was shipped faster and arrived alot early than was expected.
5,Hilarious,"Ok, so I bought this as a Christmas present for my Dad and then sat down and read it all myself (do you think he'll mind?). I have loved Calvin and Hobbes for years and the complete series is superb. I just wish we had snow so I could model snowmen like Calvin. He is my hero. And who hasn't wished they had a friend like Hobbes? Well, ok but without the full body contact rumble that is his welcome home. I think the boxed set is great and the final comic brought a tear to my eye. What a wonderful view of the world with all its complexities, nuances and humour. And what a shame there are no more..."
3,"Decent Comic, but overrated and tiresome after a while","I used to look forward to Calvin and hobbes every morning when I grew up until, at age 11, it ended. I have many fond memeories of this Comic, but going back to them is somewhat disappointing. While some are funny others are often boring. For every work of genius there is a sad retread of an older joke. These were meant to be read once a day, and reading a large group really wears you out. I always thought the comic was a bit overrated, and it seems that Watterson may have been a one-trick pony since so many of his comics are basically the same gag over and over. After the Greatness that was the Far Side collection, I think my hopes may have been too high, but that Collection is definetly a better value."
5,Daughter loves these strips,My wife and I bought this as a gift for our 8-yr daughter. I think she's read every page in this three-volume tome at least twice. She loves Calvin and his somtimes goulish imagination.Best of all we like to read these strips together.
5,Wonderful!,"This was everything I hoped it would be and more! Just to see the look on my husband's face when he opened the box was worth it all! He sits and reads the books and just starts giggling like a little kid!! Calvin is his ""new best friend"", guess now I will have to get used to sharing him with somebody else!! Best Birthday present he has ever received!"
5,So Awesome!,You will dive right into this but then pause because you will want it to last forever. You'll gaze at this collection and won't believe that ALL of C n' H is in one box. Then you'll be super stoked that you own it.
5,Amazing Set by a Comedic God,"Bill Watterson is a unique artist who captures the essence of male prepubescent dreams and desires through a boy named Calvin and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes. The duo encounter many obstacles and overcome the tyrannous rule of their adult superiors through sheer determination, imagination, and a little luck. Great for all ages. Calvin and Hobbes have grown with me through the years and they have helped make some rough times seem not so bad. I highly recommend that a fan of the series get these 3 volumes, and for those people who have never read Watterson's comic, I sincerely urge you to check it out. Very clever. Brilliant, even."
5,Calvin and Hobbes - the complete set,It was and is incredible. Hours and hours of reading entertainment. Nice to have in such good quality binding and box. Will have forever!
4,good set of books,"The books are a great read and are nicely organized by sections. However, the books are heavier than they look."
5,Awesome,"Great product for a great price. I was very surprised to have the package arrive within 3-4 days, as it was expected to arrive a week later. Highly recommended, thanks for the great service."
5,Hobbes rocks!,"I bought this for my husband who has every Calvin and Hobbes book published and for my 15 year old son who is taking over the collection. Great collection, worth every penny."
2,I hav always loved C & H but not the one delivered,"I had shipped this product out of USA (India) and I received the product with the binding of the books pretty badly damaged (it looked like a used or badly refurbished one rather then a new collection).If i hav to review the book for the material then I would giv it 5 stars but because of the condition in which I recieved , I am dissapointed. It would hav been gr8 if shipping and handling were given its due.Other then that , I hav no complaints regarding the productShreyas"
2,"My review is more about ""gift wrapping""","I chose the gift wrap option because I wanted to be able to open the box infront of my husband with out having to hide it - it was his birthday gift. And since his birthday is so close to Christmas we do not always have ""Birthday"" wrapping paper on hand. When I opened the box... the gift was ""wrapped""... and the wrapping paper was SHREDDED. Completely pointless to pay extra for wrapping a present if it is going to arrive tattered and in shreds. FAIL, Amazon!"
1,Beware - Watterson did edit,"Don't call it ""Complete"" if you have gone back to make things more politically correct. Shame on you. I was waiting for this, but refuse to buy something that has been tampered with."
1,Edited for content!,"Rumor has it that at least one comic strip has been edited to be more PC. One edit is one too many, as I have all the individual compilations. I had this on my wishlist so I could have everything in one place, but I removed it. If it's edited in any way that negates my desire to upgrade."
2,"nope, thank you. I won't have another bite","I used to be fond of that comic strip as it was released daily in your paper.but 15 years or so later, it looks like the strip really lacks diversity. it always gets back to a very limited amount of key issues or gags and over 25 pounds later (it's heavy not only because of its completeness but also because the publisher obviously picked the heaviest stock available) you're getting bored of the same situation coming over and over again.not to mention the average job the publisher did at designing the set.you might want to stick to your old soft paperbacks."
5,Complete JOY,"I have always loved Calvin and Hobbes and this set is pretty amazing. I love the introduction about Bill Watterson, it really gives an insight into why he didn't want to exploit Calvin and Hobbes through merchandising. It's a heavy collection, probably not meant for casual reading, but I read it every day anyway. All Calvin and Hobbes fans MUST BUY."
5,It's simply fantastic,"I am a fan of Calvin and Hobbes for a long time, since when I was a kid and there were daily strips in a local newspaper (Brazil). I have a few of the published books, but this collection is everything a calvinmaniac needs to fulfill its dream.I am reading the books little by little, savoring it as much as possible, and not wanting to reach the end. Although I am pretty sure that after I actually finish the book, restarting it will be such an enormous pleasure that I won't be able to help but do it.As a few other buyers have said, the pack is not so friendly to handle, and removing the book from the hard cover is sometimes an exercise of patience, in order not to damage it.Anyway, this is absolutely recommended, to people who know Calvin, Hobbes and their universe, and a great gift if you want to introduce somebody to them."
5,The Best!,Calvin and Hobbes can't get better then this if you like these to characters. Fun to read over and over!
5,Calvin and Hobbes is a must,"It's a must! A comprehensive set of all the strips, plus special drawings by the brilliant Watterson. Definitely not written for children, it's sure to entertain even the most sophisticated readers. I'm savouring my set and, as soon as I'm finished, I'll start over. Many laughs guaranteed!"
5,COME BACK CALVIN!,"This is the defintive collection on this iconic comic strip. It is beautifully presented and a fitting tribute to Calvin and his stuffed tiger. Everytime I see the comics section of a paper I think of Calvin and Hobbes and am reminded of how consitant and quality this strip was; it is missed everyday. I can't imagine anyone not loving this collection, it is quite simply, the best. Come back Calvin, we miss you..."
2,problematic binding,"The plates are wonderful, great paper, great reproduction. It is such a shame that they did not put the effort into the binding for this makes the other quality moot for the volumes fall apart on first opening. At first we thought it was a quality control problem and we sent our first volumes back (all three volume bindings were broken front and back). When we got the second set, only one volume's binding was broken on first usage. We went to a book store to check them out and see if it was just our ones and the display volumes in the bookstore had broken bindings also. My son decided to keep the one we had, not wanting to risk getting a set with more volumes of broken bindings again and valuing the plates so much that he wanted it any way. As I started, it is such a shame that they did not bind these volumes correctly. They would be so much more valuable."
