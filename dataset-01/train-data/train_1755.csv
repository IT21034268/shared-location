3,Lack of Cohesion,"I've followed Sloan since their DGG years in the early nineties, and they're one of my favorite bands ever. Although Never Hear the End of It is a step up from Action Pact, it's nowhere near as good as Between the Bridges or One Chord to Another. In fact, I agree with the reviewer that this recording could have benefited from being the usual 10-12 tracks. There's a certain lack of cohesion between the first half of the record, which merely, meanders, and the second, where seems to find its voice. The beauty of Sloan was that they were able to create wonderfully dynamic albums on the efforts of multiple songwriters/singers with differing styles, but the past few albums seem to find them floundering to capture a ""winning"" formula that will catapult them into the indie circle (which is where they should already be--come on, they're five times as good as Arcade Fire will ever be)."
5,"Please, somebody help me. I can't stop listening to this album!","I first heard Sloan when I was living in Toronto in the early nineties, and I was really into ""Smeared"" (especially ""Underwhelmed""). But ""Never Hear the End of it"" is a hundred times more accomplished, mature, and magnificent. I literally can't stop listening to it, and every time I worry about over-exposure and growing tired of it, I get more and more pleasure from it. It has, in a very short span of time, acheived what a very short list of albums have done - it is now like comfort food. The Beatles, Roxy Music, XTC, a few others, and now Sloan. Pretty respectable company."
5,a masterpiece,"their finest hour...uh, hour+.it rocks, lyrics are dense, singing is great, playing is great. however long the songs are they're completely realized and seem consistently to be at the highest of their (very) high level of quality.amazing when superb bands get even better. but they do."
5,History of Logan Co and OH,The package arrived well packaged. The book is very thorough and I immediately found several family members listed which helped me in my genealogy research. Would recommend.
3,A lot of virtuosity but what about substance,"Here we see Rick Wakeman generously displaying his virtuousity of skill and his knowledge of synthesizer music but, with a few notable exceptions, very little substance coupled with overkill on the synthesizers. The notables are, in my humble opinion, Jiggajigg, Past and Present (by his son Adam), Paint it Black. The one piece that makes this album a must have is Caesarea. One does however wish he would get an actual drummer instead of relying on drum kits so heavily. This unfortunate reliance makes for a square and predictable percussion section that does little by way of originality. If you are thinking of getting this album do not expect Alan White or Bill Bruford drum quality. Caesarea is a beautifully emotional and evocative piece though I feel he could have taken it much further."
2,Fun while it lasted,"Got this for my husband but the leather tore off the buckle after less than a year. That was disappointing. He only used it for dress, so it hadn't gotten that much wear and the leather was otherwise in good shape, it's just that where the leather is screwed onto the belt buckle, it ripped. So much for a nice looking leather belt."
4,It was good for the money,"Quality of sound was ok. It is a longer cord, so I liked that. For the price, it was a good bargain."
5,What we needed,The corded headphone marked is confusing. There are at least two different types of this cord (different pin outs). This cord worked for our Polycom phones. (It does not work for our old Cisco phones). These cords were a great price and worked! They seem to be manufactured well as we have not had any complaints yet. Make sure these are the cords you need - then go for it.
4,Plantronics Polaris Q/D Cable,"My company recently switched to VoIP from conventional phone service.In ordering headsets for the new phones, I failed to order this cable.The cost for the 3 cables I ordered, plus shipping, didn't equal the cost of one cable if ordered directly from the headset manufacturer.Product arrived in time frame I was given, and in pristine condition. This is important since the phones and headsets are brand new.Would definitely use this supplier for future needs."
5,Works Great!!,"I had a Plantronics headset and controller box for many years. Then I started having issues with the box and was using Skype on my PC more as my phone. I found this.I was having good success, but every once in a while it would drop out. I could never figure it out. NOTE: You need to plug directly into the USB port on the computer!! If you plug into a multi port hub, and something else needs access to the port, you lose connectivity."
5,nice detail,very good quality toy .it is flexible and not easy to break .it stands up without a problem.all the figures i have from bandai are good.
5,A must have,This was the only thing my son wanted on for Christmas. I couldn't believe how hard it was to get .. He was one extremely happy boy Christmas morning.
5,Excellent Item,The Mechagodzilla figure was packaged very well and arrived in the condition described. He's currently sitting amid several other Godzilla/Ultraman/Gamera figures on my monster shelf.Very satisfied with the purchase and would consider additional purchases from the seller.
5,Bear Naked ROCKS,It tastes GREAT and is GREAT for you. I love this stuff for snack and sometimes as breakfast. YUM YUM
3,very good,hawaiian is the best to me but my daughter likes the naturel with no berries or nut.something foe everyone.
5,good stuff,"I like this product. I had to buy like $2 dental floss though to get free shipping, and save like $8 -- and then they came separately packaged and on separate deliveries! Wish they'd just raise the price $2."
4,Best granola ever,"I love granola and have tried many brands. Udi's is my favorite one. I like all flavors. Eat it with plain yogurt & fresh fruit. My kids will eat it too. I am disappointed that they have changed the size from 16oz to 13oz, hence 4 starts."
3,Surprising...,"These products have a surprising;y high fat content. Tastes oily and somewhat heavy.Of all the flavors though, I loved the original and the Au Naturel. The Vanilla was suprisingly pretty tasty too."
4,"Good quality, kind of expensive","I really liked the granola, but found the cost to be prohibitive when considering purchasing it again. The au naturel version is excellent, as it is one of the few granolas you can get that doesn't have nuts (for those with allergies). It's a nice selection and the Hawaiian was very tasty."
1,Very disappointing,"The ""best by"" date is in less than a week and I am only just starting the second bag. It is Cranberry. The cranberry pieces are like broken glass. The granola itself is very so-so, not particularly tasty at all, in fact boring. Usually one can eat stuff that's good for you even if it's not too appetizing, because you have the big picture in view, but granola isn't even that healthy!!! So it had just better be good, and this isn't."
2,Not as good value as I thought,"I liked the variety and the taste of granola overall. I didn't like the Vanilla and Hawaiian, but even those were not too bad. My main problem were the bags are very small. They are listed at 13 oz, but seemed smaller than that. My family went through them very quickly. At the current price and amount you get, I don't think I would buy this again."
3,It's definately a soundtrack...,"Lovely music - really. Some other time, I would love to listen to this CD and drift away. I ordered this for my 5 year old's birthday - he's nuts for Nemo - and was thrilled to get it in time. But this is truly a soundtrack - I would say it's the score - and as far as we have listened, none of these songs have words except the last one, a Bobby Darin cover. Don't hesitate to order this - it's beautiful. But if you were looking for something to sing to, this is not the CD."
2,Surprised,"I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie. I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words. Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words. It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it."
1,Not what I was looking for...,"I was pretty disappointed by this. I was looking for songs that my kids could sing and dance to. This just was not it!! It's too bad, its one of my daughter's favorite movies."
5,Love it,"Andrew Stanton's words in the CD jacket are on the money regarding this soundtrack. Newman has a unique talent for fusing beauty and sadness, in a way that leaves, well, me, breathless. This is an exceptional movie, one whose type we need more of these days. The music is absolutely integral- the movie would not be the same without it. I enjoy the title tracks, as well as ""Field Trip"" and ""Little Clownfish from the Reef"". Wow, this is a treat."
3,The Newman Legacy,"I enjoyed the score to FINDING NEMO. It's not loud and overbearing or quite and ineffective but it didn't meet my expectations. There don't seem to be any strong musical themes included and none of the 39 tracks are over 2:30 minutes long which makes pulling out favorites very hard. None of them jump up and grab your attention. That being said though, there is a lot of character and emotion in these cues. You'll probably enjoy this score much more if you've seen the film.The 40th (and final) track on the disc is a laid-back jazzy version of Beyond The Sea performed by Robbie Williams. It's a good recording, but doesn't have the fun and energy of 'You've Got A Friend In Me' (Toy Story) or 'The Time Of Your Life' (A Bug's Life)."
2,How do you work this thing?,"As far as I know there is only one tempo and one type of dance sequence on this mat. No matter how much we play around with the different buttons it does not do anything different. This was a big request from my 6 year old daughter for Christmas and now she hardly plays with it. It entertains our 15 month old twins more! Resist any begging by your kids for this item and buy something else, a CD boombox maybe."
2,Good performance...hard to tell as the recording is of poor quality.,The famous Maria Callas performs the title role. The recording is really quite poor even for it's time period.The double CDs are packaged in cardboard case with a plastic spindle (mine broke when it arrived). Again there is no libretto....a problem given an english translationed libretto is not available anywhere online.
3,Burns & Allen - the unfunny selections,"Sadly enough I have been disappointed with both Burns and Allens CDs I purchased this month. For some reason, the people who compiled this CD managed to find the shows that were not that funny. I have listened to Burns and Allen shows before and enjoyed them. These selections were boring."
4,So far so good,1day owner. Only complaint is weak photo modifying software bundled with camera. Not even a red eye fixer.
2,Where are my pics?,"I lost about 70 jpegs because the SD100 kept corrupting the SD cards that I purchased. It was very frustrating taking really great pictures and then having the corrupted data screen come up. The pictures disappeared. I spent about a day trying to figure out what was happening, but I found out from Canon that some SD100s need a firmware update. I was referred to a website with the updates and downloaded the update (beware, some SD100s don't need this update and a download could render such cameras inporable -- except as a door-stopper). So far everything has worked fine, but everytime I press the shutter, I am jittery. Canon should have a warning about this on their website.If you are spending this much money on the camera not to mention the SD card (multiple SD cards if your data is corrupted), you should get a product that is not going to fail the first time out of the box."
3,Bad pixels in the center of view,If it weren't for the bad pixels I would have given a higher rating. Probably 4 or 5 stars. It just burns me that they can ship a camera with bad pixels in the center of the view. You should also be aware of the waranty repair process. In north america they have one warranty location. Colorado. So you will have to ship the camera to them wait 2-3 weeks and then wait to get it shipped back (they pay for return). Luckily I noticed the defect before the 1 year waranty was up. However now I have several hundred pictures with bad pixels in them.
1,BUYER BEWARE: Memory card compatibility problem,"Out of the box, this camera does not work. There's a compatibility problem with the SD card, and Canon wants you to either send the camera to them or download a firmware update from the web...---quote---The SD card compatibility problemA compatibility problem has been found between PowerShot SD100 DIGITAL ELPH/DIGITAL IXUS II cameras and some SD card from other manufacturers. We apologize for any inconvenience you may have already experience because of this problem.[Problem Description]The [Memory card error!] message appears on the LCD monitor when the camera is powered on in Shooting mode.Image replay is impossible. The [No image], [Corrupted Data], [Memory card error!] or [E51] message appears on the LCD monitor when you try to view images recorded on the SD card in the camera's Replay mode.The [E50] message appears on the LCD monitor when you try to format the SD card in the camera and formatting fails.---end quote---"
3,I won't buy this camera again...,"I owened this camera for over six months now and I must say the picture quality is not all that.I owened previously, the S110 and that camera rocks.The SD100 night pictures have these glare circles on the pictures.You could take a nice picture and have this ugly circle your face or somewhere in the frame.I don't know the cause,I called canon they said to use manual setting,but then why should I have to? the S110 never needed it...I exchanged the camera for another one thinking it's a manufacturer's defect, same thing. I had my graduation pictures with blotches on them from this.I'm trying to get rid of this camera I hate it..."
1,Canon Service is Horrible,My Canon S100 has broken multiple times and getting it fixed has been slow and expensive. Their service has been horrible and their products poorly made. I would never buy a Canon product again.
4,manual language problem,"I bought this delightful little camera in the Netherlands whilst on holiday there. I had done a fair amount of research into the choice of camera, and so knew pretty much what I wanted. When I saw it advertised I had a look at it and after I had had it demonstrated to me and I had handled it myself. I bought it. Once I was back in South Africa I realised that although all the blurb on the box was in English, and even though I had spoken English to the dealer, all the Handbooks and Manuals are in Dutch! I can manage the basic use as it is a very simple to manage camera, but for the downloading etc etc I would like to have more information and help available. Where and how can I obtain English manuals?"
4,Excellent camara for 300bucks,"I really like this camera. But if someone knows how to use it as a webcam, please help, I really appreciate it.I have a Creative webcam NX Pro but the image quality is really poor (even at highest quality setting) and the rate is slow (I use USB1.1)."
1,"""Order NEW and get USED"" deal from amazon.com","This is not about the product I ordered but rather about amazon.com.I ordered NEW SD100 Canon Powershot digital camera from amazon.com as a gift and was shocked when received the USED one with missing memory card. I called customer service on Thursday and was insured that I would receive the replacement by Saturday and there's no need to hunt for a new gift . Well, it turned out that when amazon.com representatives say Saturday they actually mean Tuesday.Hope that the camera would work better than the amazon.com and next time my review would have 5 star rating."
4,Not bad for the price and size!,"I work in an Electronics store, so I get to see all of the new cameras. The powershot100 really caught my attention due to it's small size and reasonable price, not to mention it's capability of doing video, still shots and sound play back all for around $299.99This camera takes great pictures, with reasonable shots in poor lighting conditions.I really don't have anything bad to say about the camera. It's one of the better camera's canon put out in the 3.2 megapixel genre. I have recommendend and sold this camera to many customers, with sucessful results."
2,Disappointed,"There was no description of how much video you can record with this camera. I purchased this camera for the purpose of making videos, and I also knew it took good pictures. I wanted that feature, also, so I figured it said it takes video, so if I had a big enough memory capacity, it'll take bigger videos...wrong. It's a 3 minute limit - and I was never informed of this on Amazon. Now I've spent $150 for practically nothing. On top of that, when I got this camera, the battery kept dying, even WITH a full charge. So I had them send me another battery, which kept dying on me the same one the last one did. So I am very disappointed with how this turned out."
5,Much more than I expected.,I bought this camera to have something that I could use at parties or on trips to just point and shoot when I didn't feel like or have the time to use my 35mm SLR. But what I found out was it can do much more than that. Manual mode is easy and effective. See some of my photos in customer images.
3,Auto settings not good,"I bought this camera not too long ago. Took it to New York for vacation. I must say the auto feature works well with the flash. If you do not use the flash, the color is off. I did a test inside my house with incandescent lighting and it looked awful in automatic mode with no flash. If you put it in manual mode and change the lighting to incandescent, it works but the whole point of me buying this camera was to point and shoot; not having to make it a manual type set up. Sharpness is okay. I guess I need to buy a bigger, better digital camera. Maybe a 6 mega-pixel camera. I would buy this for simple shooting but nothing else."
1,Warning! This camera has a manufacturer defect!,"This camera has a defect that wont let it recognize some SD cards, but it doesnt show up until after you have taken some shots. I took 50 pictures on vacation, then the camera went dead. It turns out that there was a defect which you can read about on Canon's website that causes ALL these cameras to malfunction until you download and install a patch. Buyer Beware! i lost all 50 irreplaceable vacation pictures, and you will too."
2,Beware of the E18 error,"I bought this camera in 2004, and it worked very well. I would agree with most of the other good reviews. However, all of a sudden the lense would not shut down and I kept getting an E18 error on screen. Apparently this is common on these types of Canon camera's (ie. the lense getting stuck), and will cost approx $150 - $250 to repair, which is more than the original cost of the camera. I did not drop it or mishandle it in any way, so it looks like a defect in the camera."
4,yeah-get this camera,"I started with a Canon A60. Happy with it and upgraeded to the A70. Both became too heavy and slow. Got rid of that and tried the Canon SD100 and it has everything you could need, except a decent sized SD card to start. I recommend getting the bigger SD card right away so you don't get this great camera and don't use the capabilities. It takes great pictures and you have to have a SD card capable of handling it! It's worth the investment. Great camera."
4,Good camera despite some setbacks,"Previuosly I have used Sony Cybershot P3, p2 and Pextax Optio S. I decided to buy this one as Canon has a good name in camera products. The picture quality is the best so far for me. The optical zoom is limited but enough for an amateur like me. The problem is the movie mode as the camera will not adjust itself to white balance or light exposure. For example, if you first started your recording in an indoor environment such as your room and then proceed to record the view of outside your window(bright sunny day), the camera would not be able to cope with the bright light as it has been set for the light exposure of the room. The screen would just be flat white. It's a major setback as all my previuos camera would adjust the white balance. Other than that, the camera doesn't have a battery indicator. It only appears when the battery is almost depleted. Not helpful enough. Other than that, the size is awesome, compact, but not as small as the Pentax optio s."
4,glad I bought it,"I rate Fast, Fun and Fabulous Quilts an 8 only because of the applique projects of which I'm not a big fan. The instructions are clear and takes the guesswork out of determing fabric yardage. Each project has tips to make the cutting and piecing more efficient. If you like stars, hearts, houses and teddy bears, get this book but it has lots more."
4,Nice flexible little system,"I found this to be a nice flexible little unit that works equally well as an MP3 amp as it does with my electric ukelele. My three sons have given it thorough going over, so it must be fairly sturdy. The distortion options are fun, and its perfect for around the house. Tried it at a gig this weekend, however, and it just doesn't have the muscle to compete with anything more substantial."
4,Beautiful pictures!!,This paper makes for gorgeous pictures when using it with my Cannon photo printer. The only complaint I have is that I don't like how the pictures feel - kind of slick and like they're always wet.
4,publishing qality pics @ home,"this is the best paper i've used to date , it looks better than the real thing when using 850i couldn't imagine it with a 950 printer. The only issus is the fist couple pics tend to display banding...machine warmup mabye , but overall excellent picsproduced with this paper"
4,"Good, but a bit sticky","I love the borderless printing. The reason I gave only 4 stars is because the back of the paper is a bit sticky, so it is a little uncomfortable when looking at the picture, but otherwise this is a great product. Just like it came from the photo lab!"
3,Excellent quality but too [costly],These paper should cost less.... You do the math. I don't see the future for photo inkjet printer.
3,book,"Different Florida viewpoint. Good for your ""library"". The PBS show is even more entertaining. & I live near several! Visited most too."
3,"Kind of a ""weird Florida map""....but, I caution...","It was interesting and fun to see these wacky sites plus to read the folklore, and it does kind of aid the tourist who wants to see weird parts of the state. But I found more enjoyable was Elliots Kleinberg's Book of the same name."
3,Interesting book but...,"This book has many interesting stories about folklore, but overall it is poorly written and contains very few facts or reliable, cited references. It is akin to a ghost story book and is best taken with a light heart. The most disappointing thing is that the author resorts to printing emails/letters from anonymous individuals, and these alone make up about 1/3 of the text. See if your local library has this so you don't waste your money."
4,"Well done, decent info","Written by a Florida native, Weird Florida contains a lot of funny and strange stories. Although not strictly a travel book, a little more effort could have been given to directions and locations. Frequently it seems the author assumes a pretty detailed knowledge of Florida geography. Some towns used as location indicators are tiny and obscure, even they are nearby a major metro area, which is usually unmentioned. Otherwise it seems to be a good collection of anecdotes, stories, sightings and legends. Will see many of the places on an upcoming trip to Florida."
5,It works!,"Prior to using Power-Dophilus, it seemed that I caught everything that was going around and was not only affecting my personal life but my work schedule as well. I had been seeing an accupuncturist who recommended I give this product a try and since opening the first bottle 10 years ago, I haven't had a cold, sore throat, flu bug or stomach issue.I recently tried a few products that were conveniet to purchase but they don't seem to have the same affect for me, so I am back with Country Life Power-Dophilus and will stay with it."
3,I am BuMMMed out,"I bought Orleans two album best of ""Still the One"" and all the songs from Orleans first album are on it except ""Bum."" You know... I'm a B.U.M. bum bum shadobewoweeee.This is not the first time! Careless is out of print. The record company wants you to buy: On And On: The Hits Of Stephen Bishop, but it just doesn't feel the same. Record companies: THE COMPILATION MATTERS. I like all the songs on Careless and I like them in the original order.Come on record companies print the origianls... they will sell well. I will buy them!"
1,"this CD does not have ""love takes time""","considering the number of mediocre songs on this supposed ""greatest hits"" compilation i find it very hard to explain why they would not include ""love takes time"" which i consider one of Orleans three biggest hits and one of my favorites. overall, i was very disappointed and would certainly not buy the CD again."
5,Great,"I remember hearing this song when it first came out (I think I was about 9). I loved it. I heard it on the radio the other day and ended up buying the CD. I can't listen to ""Still the One"" loud enough. I put my stereo on volume 6, my house is rock'n, widows shak'n, dishes falling in the sink. Love it."
5,Truly amazing heartfelt worship!,"Wow! Wow! Wow! This is my favorite worship album I've ever heard and believe me I've listened to a lot of them! Jeremy Riddle's voice, music, lyrics, and best of all his heart really shine through in a most humble, sincere way on Full Attention. The rawness of this album is very apparent and gives the listener a great opportunity to stand before the throne of God and pour out their hearts to Him in love and gratitude. I believe and hope that Riddle is a modern day David and hope that he always stays ""Sweetly broken"" for the rest of his days so he can continue to create more great raw worship to a great and holy God who deserves to be glorified."
5,Music,I love this cd! Jeremy has an awesome voice and the words in his songs reflect so many wonderful feelings toward God. Thanks to Jeremy for sharing his gift.
5,Impressive,"There's a lot of songs on here that sound good that you could actually do for worship. ""More than a Friend"" sounds kinda like a cheesy name, but it's a BEAUTIFUL song. There are some songs on here that ""rock out"", too. His voice sounds a little like another Jeremy (Camp), but the instrumental sound is a little more airy and atmospheric. It's a pretty unique sound, but familiar enough to keep you comfortable with it.Just after I typed the previous paragraph (this is an edit), I decided to listen to it in my living room while holding my 1-yr-old son. He never falls asleep while someone's holding him. He must have liked this song. He wasn't even tired, and he was OUT. It was precious."
5,Great CD,"I heard Jeremy's single ""Sweetly Broken"" on radio just this past Tuesday and it immediately caught my attention. I immediately went and bought the album. This cd is a refreshingly new voice in christian worship music. Everysong is a strong song of praise to the Lord. I highly recommend this cd. Jeremy's voice along with the haunting melodies and music will take you right to a place of worship."
4,"Sweetly Broken, Wholly Surrendered!","I first heard of Jeremy Riddle, like most people, through the song ""Sweetly Broken."" This is an incredible song, one of the best I have heard in years. Atmospheric, haunting vocals, and with words that hit you right in the heart. After hearing this song, I had extremely high expectations for this CD - and because of that, I was left a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong; this is a good CD with some very good songs on it. But none of them come close to ""Sweetly Broken."" I liked ""God Of All Glory"" and a few of the other songs. I think he has great potential (because his voice is amazing) and he can only get better. Definitely a four-star album worth adding to your collection."
4,Great Album,"Para los que prefieren el castellano, aquí va una reseña. En realidad, habría que ponerle cuatro estrellas y media a este disco, pero no se puede. Entonces, cuatro me parece mejor. ¿Por qué? Porque es grande pero no fenomenal. En realidad, aquí hay dos Caetanos. El más moderno, con guitarras eléctricas a cuestas y canciones más pop que a veces se me hacen un poco largas. La excepcìón es ""O Estrangeiro"", que es un tema espectacular. El otro Caetano es el que agarra su guitarra acústica y se pone a cantarnos a nuestro oído junto a su banda unplugged. Ése es el mejor, el que entona ""Branquinha"", ""Etc"", ""Genipapo Absoluto"" y varias otras melodías inolvidables."
5,Estrangeiro,"First, the name of the CD is ESTRANGEIRO and not Estrangerio! Well, I think that Estrangeiro is one of the greatest CDs he has made, back when Caetano was a lot fresher than he is now. Estrangeiro and Circulado are his best in the 90s. Recently, Livro is also pretty strong and for the soundtrack to Orfeu, there is only one song that is strong enough ""Sou voce"", which is quite lyrical."
3,Good CD- Not as good as Homecoming however,"I was kind dissapointed with this cd after listening to Homecoming for so long. It had a different feel to it, and although the music was good, there was just something missing about it. If it were a choice between the two i would definitely recommend going with Homecoming before this one."
3,Mediocre,"Cb's new album is nothing to good to rush out and buy. although they have some excellent songs the rest are missing something. They aren't really that punk anymore, the chords are weird sounding on some songs. the previous album was bodacious although somewhat repetitive, so if you want a CB album get the first one."
3,growing marijuana hydroponically,"The book, sorry to say, is not worth the investment. there is nothing new there, nothing that any other book on growing in this method would not provide."
3,basic book,if your looking for anything groundbreaking this definately isnt it. If you are lokoing for something to give you BASIC knowledge of the hydro procedure. get it.If you have basic knowledge this wont do you much good.
3,This book was usful in some areas,Had very little resources on harvesting and preparing the buds. The book was worth reading and was good for beginers starting out on growing.
3,Decent book,I used this book for a report I wrote for one of my college courses and it had good information but did not exceed with information if that makes sense? It was all general knowledge that you could easily get off the internet.
2,Reviwed by Rosie!,"I really dont recommend this c.d to anyone cause the beat of the music was kinda off and the lyrics are so pathetic and made no sense. The olnly reason why i bought the c.d is cause i also only saw the ""Unbeleiveable"" music video and i loved the song soo much that i assumed that if i buy the c.d the songs will be just as good.( I was wrong). So dont buy this c.d. The only great song is ""Unbelievable"" and you can eaily burn that one song to a c.d.i am so dissapointed that kaci only put her good voice to use in the ""Unbelievable"" song.:("
4,"she deserves a 3, but ill give her a 4 since she writes her on material.","Well i must say, when i first saw the video for ""Unbelievable"" Kaci Brown caught my attention. So when i saw her albulm at Target i thought to myself ""hey, why not?!"" Not to say that i regret that decision, but the truth in matter is that Kaci is not one of the greatest singers. At best she's slighty above Britney Spears and a little bit below Jessica Simpson...but hey thats cool to. Kaci's voice isn't unbearable, actually its quite nice when she uses it right, like in ""Unbelieveable."" But besides in that song her vocals are pretty breathy, like she's whispering. However sum of the songs are pretty good, like ""Instigator"", ""Like ""Em like That"", ""Thank You"", ""The Waltz"" and ""Unbelievabe"" of course. Songs like ""My Baby"" and ""You Fool"" will possibly grow on you...and the rest i can live without. So i recommend this albulm to people who like Britney Spears' and Jessica Simpson's voices in one. Also people who like pop and r&B."
3,one hit wonder,I really liked the entire cd but haven't heard anything about a second cd or anything new in the past few years.
4,Much better than before,"This album is something that you can dance to, but the songs have tapered away from Ms. Brown's candy coated pop, to a more mature sounding music. This is a definite hit!"
2,Guitar Work,"The guitar work on this CD and all of their CDs is good. However, they all sound alike.Nothing new.I give it two stars for the technical guitar work.It is full of clichés in percussions and over all guitar melodies."
2,"Great band, awful lyrics","MxPx is a great Christian band and i love them!!! But i'm not to fond of their lyrics in this one. None of them mention God. They all have great tunes and beats but they're missing somthing much more important than beats and tunes, GOD!! I know they are Christian and i love their band!"
2,"Even on a purely musical level, this is generic pop-punk","Okay, besides ideological quibbles, this is still utterly generic pop-'punk', taking music nowhere it hasn't been before."
1,Where's God?,Okay. they music is semi- good but if everyone is calling them a Christian Band. Where's God? I went over that entire CD and God wasn't mentioned once in lyrics or thank-you's. I love Punk but they are someone I wont buy again. Now if they are going to call themselves Christains and not make atrleast one somg bout God. Atleast say thanx to him in the credits. I know a guy who worshipps the devil and MxPx is his favorite band. Do you see something wron with that?
2,This is not punk.,"This is saccharine sweet pop music, which is fine in itself, but please don't call it punk. Punk attacks social institutions like Christianity, it does not preach them. Irritatingly sweet, twee and tight as a gnat's 'towel-holder', with a message that has been used to justify 2000 years of wars, oppression and bloodshed. Not my cup of tea."
5,One of my favorite albums of all time!,"Over time, I have heard a lot of different music by many different artists, and I have to say MxPx is one of the best bands I've ever heard. Their lyrics are clean, and the music will be stuck in your head a lot. (which is a good thing) I would have to say they are pros at writing lyrics, and the music itself.So here you are, looking at this album, wondering if you should buy it or not. The answer? YES! This is one of their best albums, and it contains many of their classics (Chick Magnet, Doing Time, Southbound, etc.) If you want to get into MxPx but don't know where to start, you should get this first. End of story."
5,Amazing,There is not one song on this whole CD that I don't like. I've been a big fan of MxPx for a long time and by far this is their best album!
2,Its all the same,"I'm not that pleased with this cd. I feel that most punk bands seem to write all there songs to sound exactly alike. MxPx has some nice stuff on their cd. such as ""do your feet hurt"" and ""The wonder years"" but most of the rest of their songs are a spunky on-ward drone of guitar riffs that seem to sound EXACTLY the same no matter what song your listening to. If your looking for something new and different, dont look here, but if reliable pick-me-up music is what you seek, search no more."
2,"MXPX should stop WHINING,and start ROCKING","oh come on all that MXPX does on this album is WHINE about girls!!!!!!!!!! PUNK music is about ROCKING not WHINING ,if you want a REAL MXPX cd than you should get POKINATCH"
4,"The egde is gone, but at least you can dance to it.","Listening to this album the first time through, all I could think of was ""sell-out."" The edge from the previous albums is altogether gone. But I must say, although it is harder to mosh to this album, it's alot easier to dance to. It seems like MXPX softened themselves a bit in order to appeal to the mainstream in this one. If you're not really into punk, this is the best MXPX album to buy, 'cause you'll probably like it. But to BIG MXPX fans, this one was a little of a disapointment. (Although it was pretty cool to see Chick Magnet on MTV.)"
4,Not their best but still pretty good,Everyone thinks that this is MxPx's best album but 'slowly going the way of the buffalo' atcually is. This album has some really good songs on it and is the foundations for pop-punk as we know it but some of the songs just plain stink.
5,mxpx's best CD,"These guys are not only the best punk band ever, but they are the best band in general. I've heard ""mxpx"" described as a mix between Green Day and Blink 182. That's a pretty close comperison, but I still think they are better then both of those bands. I think ""Life In General"" is their best CD becase it has their best songs on it. My favorite track would probubly be ""Chick Magnet."" ""Doing Time, Destroyed By You, Andrea and Today Is In My Way"" are also good. Even though they have went to a secular label they have still remained true to their belifs. That's cool!"
3,I think it's fairly obvious...,"...that reviewers, ""Bashir Adam,"" and ""Andrew Jones,"" (c'mon can't you come up with a better aka than that?) is the same person, esp. when you click on the names and read their other reviews. One has to question the ""frame of mind"" of a person who has such an axe to grind with a performer that he will go out of his way to slam all of his albums, not just once, but while pretending to be different reviewers?!"
1,bilaskhani gazal?? or todi,"my girlfriend brought this album for me on my birthday because she knows I'm an avid listener of Indian classical music,since it comes from my girlfriend I love it. The sitar sounds sweet, Shujjhat plays very sweetly and i like to hear it during bedtime. The raaga bilaskhanitodi is performed melodiously,although its definately not in a classical format its more of a gazal or folk type. Of course I didnt expect this album to be classically serious such as Pandit Ravi Shankar or Nikhil Banerjee or for that matter Shahid pervez (Pervez and Shujjhat are of the same style)I think artists like shujjhat khan and other semiclassical musicians are ideal for weddings and parties. I would reccomend this album for cocktail parties or maybe during dinner. Its quite relaxing"
5,Great Saturday Night Collection,"Have enjoyed this CD more on romantic nights than any other CD I own...wore out a tape and have loaned out and lost many copies! Nobody is like Smokey, and this collection is on FIRE!"
5,Efficient and effective PMP preparation tool,"This 244 book fills in the gaps in the PMBOK 2000, and also provides complete coverage of professional responsibility topics and requirements. It's designed as a 120 hour course of instruction, and is focused on the important knowledge factors that you'll encounter on the PMP exam.It provides clear and complete explanations of the PMBOK 2000 core concepts without the fuzziness or verbosity that characterizes the PMBOK. It also contains exercises and practice exams to help you prepare, and gives tips on what to study, including material that will be on the exam that is not covered in the PMBOK.What I like about this guide is the lack of fluff, the focus on learning the exam and the preparatory advice that is given."
3,This book helped me clear the PMP Exam,"This book complements the PMBOK and is good reference for passing the PMP Exam. The practice questions at the end of each topic definitely reinforce the understanding.This book can certainly do with some improvements. I am not too thrilled with the way the material has been laid out on this book. A thorough proof reading will definitely make it better. I do not know how the 4th edition has shaped up.Overall, this book is good and it helped me clear the exam with a high percentage."
4,Must Have,I took my PMP exam and cleared it with fair margin.Rita's book provided useful information which helped me in answering several questions in the real exam. I think besides PMBOK you need to use this book as reference if you wish to improve your chances of success.
1,DON'T buy this!!!,"This is a great example of a well known brand name making and selling a cheap piece of junk.. Avoid at all costs. There's nothing more useless than a gun safe that won't open. AND yes, I've tried to get support to fix this safe for over a year -- with NO response. Ever since Cannon bought Gunvalt, the product quality has gone WAY down. I own other Gunvaults (mini's) that work fine -- but both of my micro vaults do not function correctly!!!!! As others have noted, I'd rate this zero if I could..."
1,Dead buttons after 2 months - unreliable,"After 2 months of use the #2 and #3 buttons do not respond. Poorly engineered, very ""cheap"" ribbon cable connects buttons to lock unit. I had purchased this to secure a firearm yet provide a reasonable access time in an emergency. The access can be hit or miss in an emergency due to the mushy / non-tactile feel of the buttons even before this unit failed. They do not always register key presses and certainly fail if you hit a double key too quickly. Granted it does lock and cable to an anchor point for minimal theft protection."
4,Gets the job done,This gunsafe allows me to secure a pistol so I can put it in a car or transport it without worrying about kids or others gaining access. It is small enough to fit under the seat.A determined person with tools could open this safe but if I want it to be truly secure I put it in a large home safe. Nothing that fits under the seat can thwart this type of attack.The buttons are a bit touchy. I learned that they take an aggressive touch. If I don't push hard enough (especially with combinations that require several buttons at once) that I will have to reenter the code. This is an area for some design improvement.This does exactly what I wanted it to do.
5,Fabulous!,This was the best price for this product that I found when shopping around and the person I gave it to was so thrilled with the quality and product!
3,For the most part does what it's suppose to do.,"I purchased this product to hold a Beretta 92A1, spare magazine and small flashlight, it hold those items perfectly. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because there is a slight gap when closed resulting in being able to move the lid 1/16"" up and down when locked. I had expected it to close completely tight with no play. This does not appear to have an effect on function but it does leave a slight gap that you could get a very small screw driver into and start prying away. So far I have not had a single issue with the buttons, code not working or the unit not opening up correctly."
2,"Inconsistent operation, poor quality control.","There were purchased for a night table. The first one was DOA. Would not even light up. Customer service was responsive, asked me to sen it back to Amazon. I got a new one sent out quickly. The second one works, sort of. It does not reliably release and open on the first try. Half of the time I have to enter the code twice. New batteries tried twice. If this were an emergency, having to enter the code twice is not acceptable. I do not recommend it."
4,Good safe,It works well. Small and compact. Holds my XD 45 Tactical with a tactical light equipped nicely.I do not like that it requires batteries and the buttons are very stiff. Buttons may loosen up with use.
5,slim gunvault,"we bought this as suprise xmas gift for in-laws. they want to have judge loaded, ready to go, but couldn't do that with toddler in house. this did the trick so good. now they can have a loaded gun by bedside with out any sefety issues. they love it so much, they about to order 2 more for friends and relatives."
5,Small and does the job great!,I have one in end table by my bed and probably going to buy another for my truck for when I need to store my pistol when I need to.
5,Perfect!,I love this safe - it's perfect for keeping in my nightstand. I feel safe knowing its quickly accessible in an emergency and it keeps my kids safe.
5,Excellent and Easy,This is an excellent safe. Very easy to use and has opened the first time every test I have made on it. I highly recommend it.
1,Didn't last,"This is a great idea, flat profile, usable in the dark, relatively sturdy. Only problem was the keypad failed within about 6 months. First the pinky went out then the ring finger went out (using your right hand). Found the vendor (not Amazon) and Gunvault itself to be very unhelpful in correcting the problem. Have had their other product with the spring loaded door that has worked great for 3 years plus and only one battery change. But this flat profile is a loser."
3,Not for small hands,"This is a good size small safe for a gun, however the key pad is large. The finger placement is far apart and not good for female hands or anyone with small hands. I found that you really had to stretch your fingers to get them on the pad, but when you started typing your code, it was even harder.I was really going to buy this; however i saw it at a store today and glad that i did. I will not be purchasing this item."
1,Crap product and miserable customer support,"Will never buy another product from Gunvault, and sorry I bought this one.Keypad failed completely after a little over a year of light use, leaving pistol inaccessible with no warning.Surprise! You weren't counting on this thing to help you in an emergency were you?Customer support asked for the serial number, then declined to do anything whatsoever. No repair option, paid or unpaid, no credit, no advice, nothing.Perhaps early, silent failure is normal for Gunvault products? How would you feel about a smoke detector that did the same thing?Never again."
2,"Third defective one, waiting on my fourth replacement","I own two of the ""mini"" line of gunvaults, and have had good service from them. The Deluxe model failed after 3 years in service, but they are sending a replacement.Now, for the ""micro"" vault, this thing has been nothing but failure. The orginal one quit functioning after a few weeks. Gunvault sent a replacement, that one lasted for two weeks, sent it back, the replacement they sent the 2nd time never did work. After two calls with tech support, they are sending a replacement for the ""mini"" vault that failed and they are currently backordered on the ""micros"" tell sometime in march. Hopefully the fourth one will be a charm.Customer service is good, the buttons in the ""micro"" series are mushy and unreliable. These things have so far been 100 dollar thin sheetmetal boxes that require a key. If I always wanted to use the key, i'd buy one of the $20 dollar ones."
1,Junk,Not impressed at all. Did not buy from amazon and I wish I had because it would be going back. Would not open till I got the pen grinder out and make adjustments to the cheap plastic parts inside. If some one were to enter your home uninvited this safe offers no protection from someone getting your gun period. Chinese junk. Might keep the kids out but dont count on it. Buy a real safe.
1,Don't Buy This... You Will Definitely be Disappointed,"1. The web page for this says, ""GunVault Bio uses biometrics, specifically fingerprint recognition, to access the safe contents."" But this model doesn't use biometrics... another model does!2. I agree with everything B. Ripley says... in fact, the buttons are so unsensitive/weirdly sensitive that it's impossible to program the damn thing because I can't enter the same thing twice (it thinks)!3. You have to keep it unmuted because the buttons are so bad4. there's no drilled holes in the bottom to use to attach it to something, which means that someone can just walk off with it... unless of course you use the joke-of-a-security cable they give you, which you could probably cut with a nail clipperThank goodness I got this at Amazon so I can return it."
5,Great product at good price,"This product works great for what I wanted. I already had a larger GunVault for multiple handguns, but I wanted a smaller one that I could keep in my nightstand drawer. It fits perfectly, and holds a handgun, keys, and a small flashlight. It is very easy to unlock in the dark. I would definitely buy again."
1,I hate it! batteries last only a few hours,"I got a deal on the price but the dam thing eats batteries in a few hours. Dont know wht to do, I think IM stuck using the key."
3,Ok so far,"I've only had this for a month or so, so please keep that in mind. My experience so far is this product is ok. Size is good and slips nicely into a top drawer of my night stand (my top drawer is a very thin one, and then we have the two regular drawers beneath) so that is a plus. My knock on this product is the finickiness of the finger combos. Mine takes a deliberate pause between each sequence to successfully open. I can't just hit the combos and then move quickly to my firearm as I would have liked to expect. Sometimes it takes three or four tries to get it open. I may try the biometric ones later, but for now I give this one a 3 out of 5-star rating due to the lack of confidence in getting the safe open quickly when needed."
4,Gunvault peace of mind,"Product was at a great price, and shipped quickly. the safe fits nicely in my F250 armrest and in my dresser. Easy combo setup for the wife and me. Hold to pistols and two magazines."
3,Works...but could be better,"I bought this for my wife to store her 9mm medium frame pistol in her desk at home. My requirements were fast access and security good enough to keep curious kids out. This unit does well in both aspects but I have one minor complaint.I have another gun vault I keep upstairs and when it opens there is a positive spring action that gets the door clear fast so I can reach right inside. This unit, on the other hand, only opens enough for me to get my fingers inside and open it the rest of the way using my other hand to retrieve the pistol. This could slow things down in a situation where every second counts.Other than that, the unit is very well built and has worked evrey time I've opened it."
2,Stinks.,"I like the safe, but it STINKS. I mean, literally. The ""foam"" interior smells like moth balls. I've tried everything to ""de-smellify"" it (from baking soda to spraying it with air/fabric freshener to ""airing it out"" in the sun for hours) with no success. I'd return it if I had saved the box."
1,Junk,"I have the GunVault MV500. It is a total POS. Worked well for a few months, then stopped. I put fresh batteries in it (dated 12/2013). Still would not take a new code. After reading several posts about various problems and supposed solutions, I bought new batteries again. Tried over and over. Would not ""learn"" a new code. Now I have a key-only box. Total waste of money. Go ahead and Google GunVault problems and you will see that I am not the only one."
5,Good,"Good product, simple, does what it says, easy to use. I can open this in the dark in a matter of seconds. Convenient, don't have to worry about keeping a key handy. Have it attached to my nightstand, can leave it open overnight and quickly flip it shut in the morning. If you take the time to read the simple manual it's easy to program and use."
5,Great product,"This unit is as advertised. Easy to program and easy to use/open. The cable makes it easy to use in almost any location. I use it in the car, hotel and camper."
5,Good Safe,"Easy to use, good quality product, good price. A safe like this is needed anytime you intend to travel to California with a firearm. I'm in AZ and the gun laws are much more relaxed regarding firearm transport. As soon as you cross into CA, you are required to transport your firearm in a combination safe like this. Always keep any firearm in your house in a gun-vault/ safe especially if you have children."
5,Great little safe.,"Bought the safe for my Glock 19, which fits perfectly and has more then enough room for multiple mags if needed. I also like that it can be mounted or a cable can be wrapped and attached.I liked the product so much that I have purchased a second for my father."
4,Good Value for Specific Purpose,"Wanted a safe / security box for traveling with pistol Wanted to ensure that I was able to secure the firearm while staying in a hotel room. Worked great. The cable is not the strongest (but hey, what did you expect, a 10-pound anchor chain??) While it is not likely hold up against determined attack, it is not really intended to do so. The programing of the access code was pretty easy. Total 'set up' out of the box less than 5 minutes (maybe 2).I am able to store a Glock Compact and extra magazine with plently of room.I have been using it for about a month now, so I cannot comment on long term durability.PROs;- Inexpensive- Small / light enough to go in medium size satchel or packpack.- Easy operation / programing- Comes with 'security' cableCONs;- Not high security- Lid is not spring loaded (must manually lift)Overall, glad to have it."
5,Very Nice,Me and my husband wanted something safe and convenient to store a fire arm that provided quick access and this is exactly what this micro vault provided us with. Delivery was quick and successful. We've had it for a couple of months now and we are very satisfied with the money we spent and with product itself.
5,Gun Vault,"Works as advertised. No problems. Fair price. It is a good feeling to have one of weapons at bedside reach, and still provide safety to my children."
4,Gun vault,I like this product. I gave four stars instead of five because when you first get this you have to air it out for several days due to the strong chemical odor.
5,Gunvault MV500 STD,"I love this thing! I can put cash, jewelry, my weapon and an extra magazine in it. I secure it in the trunk & sometimes inside the vehicle with the cable that was included with the purchase. Will get one for my wife's auto also."
2,Nice looking gun vault but electronics are defective,Nice looking compact gun safe but when I ordered this unit I was weary about some of the reviews describing issues with the electronics. Sure enough I just received and the electronics acted erratically. I thought it was me just learning how to operate it - most of the time it required me to enter the key sequence twice for it to open. Then after 2 hours of being n service it would not unlock at all with the exception of using the key. I tried switching batteries with no change. I'm sending it back for a replacement. Hopefully the second one will work correctly. My guess is that GunVault doesn't spend a a lot on quality control.BTW - This is of no fault of amazon - they had the order to me within one day of ordering it and their return process couldn't be easier.
5,Gun vault,"Absolutely wonderful, with a 9 year old grand daughter it is just the thing. On trips it lays right between my wife and I on the seat !"
4,Lock seems a little flimsy,"The buttons are very responsive. When not used to it, at first the buttons feel like you have to really push on them to make them work, but if you force yourself to push very lightly, they do work without very little effort. My only complaint would be the flimsy looking locking mechanism. I am afraid that all one would have to do to open it is to forcefully jar it or drop it on a hard floor and it would pop right open. The previous review with the video of the vibration opening the lock actually doesn't surprise me just looking at the way the lock works."
4,Solid for the price,This is a great safe for the price. Compact and serves its purpose. Well built and easy to operate just wish it was a little quieter when it opens.. Unlike biometric safes you know one of two ways this safe will open every time when you need it. I would definitely recommend it and might buy another.
5,Nice,It is everything I thought it would be. I feeel much better with the gun in a safe now that I have a five year old grandson that gets around and curious.
1,Disappointing Product from Good Company,"First, let me say thanks to Gunvault for all they've done to create products that keep gunowners and their families safe. However, this isn't their best effort. The Gunvault MV 500-STD I received had a significant gap when fully locked which seems to invite prying. The cable was extremely thin and the internal mount for the cable was also suspect. The foam padding was thin and didn't extend to the edges of the safe (plus as another poster recounted there was no padding along the sides so if your contents slipped they would rub against metal and the cable mount. I didn't have a problem with the key or the push buttons as other posters stated. Last, though I understand branding and advertising, it seems extremely unwise to display the words ""Gun Vault"" on the top of this device, announcing to all who see it what might be inside. The GunVault logo is welcome in my home, but not so much in my car!"
1,"Defective product, worse customer service","One day after I got this, two of the buttons stopped working, forcing me to rely solely on the key to open the safe. When I tried calling Tech/Customer Support, I rarely ever got through to a person, usually I got a recording telling me to call during normal business hours, even though that was exactly what I was doing! I left a message to call me during the morning because I work at night, and...you guessed it. Tech support called me in the evening during work! I had to ask Tech support to call me back the next day in the morning and they never did. I am trying to return this for a refund, but my attempts at correspondences have gone unanswered."
3,Repaired,"With Cannon's name behind the brand, you expect instant reliability. At first the MV500-Std would only open with a key, the keypad would signal correct entry of the code and try to open, but the latch has a weak spring design. Now the weak or broken spring can't keep the lid closed. From cool and exciting product to paperweight in a couple of days. Have contacted customer service, will post if I learn anything.Made in ChinaRevised to three starPhoned technical support. Tech support was quick friendly and knew what the problem was. Small problem in initial assembly, there is a linkage next to the motor which binds and prevents the latchwork from operating. In a couple of minutes with a screwdriver and adjustable wrench (slide the motor and re-fasten), the gunvault is put right and seems to be working fine. Better than shipping back for repair."
1,No service if it breaks,I have three of these safes that I purchased when they hit the market. Today only two of them are operational. Both have keypad problems. In an emergency you cannot get into this safe. I called customer service (waited 53 minutes)and they stated that if it is out of warranty (which mine are) they do not service them. This means my three purchases are useless. I cannot recommend products from Gun Vault if they do not service what they sell.
4,Good gun safe,"I like a few things about this safe. The indentations for your fingers makes it easy to tap in the combination even in the dark. I really like the ""silent"" feature. My last box beeps every time you push a button. This makes it hard to remove your hand gun without being heard/noticed, a bad thing is there's a bad guy in the house. Keep in mind that this box is mainly to keep the kids away from the guns. This box would not stand up to a pry bar or big screw driver so if you are looking for a ""safe"" look elsewhere but this is a good solid lock box."
5,Love my gun safe.,Perfect size to securely store my home protection. Easy to get in and out of and comfortably stores two pistols.
4,Gunvault MV-500,The gunvault is perfect for my hand gun. I purchased the MV-500 to keep in my night stand for quick access but be safe from children. I will also use the vault for car trips by using the included cable to secure it to the car.My only problem was setting a new access code. There was a loose wire on the circut board keeping it from accepting a new code. Gunvault's customer service person guided me to the problem and helped resolve it.I would recommend the Gunvault MV500. Shipping was quick.
3,Works most of the time,"Nice compact unit. Keypad sometimes does some funny things, which is a bit of a worry, but most of the time it works fine. Gun, extra clip and some other assorted stuff fits fine."
5,Great safety vault,"This safe is large enough to store my Ruger LC9 & my Glock 19 in at the same time. It is a little tricky when you are slow in opening safe, but other than that, good unit"
5,Works exactly as advertised,Came on time. Was easy to set the codes. Practiced 20-30 times and pops open what it's supposed to. I feel confident this will work in an emergency.
2,code,you have to enter a code by pushbuttons . i dont recomend having to remember that in an emergency would suck ..... i sent this back and got a handgun safe that scans your finger and opens...... backup key opener to...... much faster
5,WOW,"I alredy was a fan of Shotgun Messiah and Zinny Zan, when I heard this record my head was blown away, it's a record that is good from the beginning to the end, there is no weak song and really made my head bang.SUPER RECOMENDED for true rock and roll fans."
4,IM WITH THEM !,This cd rocks it just absolutely rocks. Sounding more like 80s music with a modern kick the Zan Clan just tries to kick your butt. A friend just recently turned me on to this one and 4 days later I just cant stop listening to it and believe me I have plenty to replace it with. Im really liking the rock on this cd and Ibelieve any 80s or modern rock fan would too. Id have to ask who would'nt?
5,Flamenco,"It is very easy to become confused by so many different forms of Flamenco (Jazz Flamenco, Classical Flamenco, etc); to this extent, there often are flimsy recordings and interpretations of the art. Where other recordings fail, this disc SHINES!! This disc has the very boldness..the very warmth of seville as you start from the beginning of the disc to the very end. A worthy recording...indeed."
3,"Good news, bad news","I have very mixed feelings about the mononymic Rodrigo.He certainly has some original ideas. In addition he has considerable technical facility; but also, unfortunately, a tendency to let it run away with him to the detriment of the rhythm. A perfect example of this is the Soleares, which starts strongly for four compases and then degenerates into a shapeless mess.Even in the pieces that remain more or less in compás, there is often a rhythmic flabbiness. A reliance on showy ligados does not improve matters.None the less, a lot of this album makes entertaining listening if you're not too fussy."
3,a different perspective,"While I agree with reviewers generally that this is a good book, i should warn that bredon isnt for the faint of heart. He makes use of simple language from category theory, doesnt always completely introduce his discussions (see for example the chapter on the tangent bundle where tangent bundle is never defined), and some other things that are nuisances to the newcomer.I do think this is a good modern readable textbook, but for the student who has a solid foundation in mathematics. I didnt find it as accessable as other topology books, say Hatcher or Lee's books (but lee's are not as complete)."
3,An exercise in density,Wide background in a lot of algebra and analysis is required just to make sense of the first chapters. More of a reference than a text.
4,Great Review Book,"I used this book to review for a Qualifier in Topology and found it exceptional. Lots of material presented in a well thought out manner. As a student, I highly recommend it as a first year grad text.."
2,never really liked it,but maybe you will.i think it was Vick's book that i preferred.Massey--I preferred Massey.i think that this is the one for the grown-ups.
5,"Great Reading, Great Man of God","Honest memoirs by those who knew him best in various capacities: his children, his sons-in-law, his students, his peers. I enjoyed reading every page, and did not put it down until I had finished. I highly recommend this book to all those acquainted with Dr. Clark, but also to those who did not know him. His desire to honor God in all areas of his life should be an encouragement to all."
4,wonderful sample of lives touched,"Yes, the Trinity Foundations' obsession with EVERYONE being beyond the pale is in ironic contrast to Clark's own approach. But this is one book of theirs really worth reading. Nothing earthshattering here, just simple testimonies of people great and small who were touched by Dr. Clark. Some are homeshold names (Carl Henry, Ruth Graham Bell), others are obscure, but all testify to the intense devotion, brilliant mind, and tender heart they encountered. Some knew Dr. Clark as a PhD philosophy student at Univ of Penn., some as a Presbyterian pastor, some as a professor at Wheaton College, some as family members, some as childhood friends, but all saw a humble servant of Christ.I especially enjoyed the testimonies of Presbyterian heros Ed Clowney (pres. of Westminster Seminary), Ronald Nash (RTS Orlando prof), and John W. Sanderson (Covenant Seminary).It reminds us how heartbreaking his witch trial by the OPC was.Buy an extra copy for your pastor or church library."
5,Dr. Gardner just wouldn't understand.,"At the risk of being redundant, Disintegration is more an elegy of sound than it is a conventional album. With the innumerable layers of sound, weaving of lyrics and chord structures, The Cure creates an environment where the listener has no option, or desire, but to be immersed in raw emotion. I once had the ""audacity"" to compare the works of the Cure to with the quality of other well known, but dead, composers. My choral director told me I had no place to compare ""that Smith guy"" to Barber or Beethoven. Maybe not, but I still think I was right. NOTE: Contrary to what has been written by other reviewers, you CAN successfully listen to ""Mixed Up"" before listening to ""Disintegration."" That's how I got my introduction to the Cure some ten years ago, and I'm all the better for it (though Mixed Up really is mediocre in comparison)."
2,Too loud......,"The bass has been overblown on this remaster, and the louder tracks suffer from quite a bit of clipping. It's a shame as some parts of the sound are better, but as a whole the original CDs are still superior."
5,the best cure album ever,"this is the best album the cure ever recorded every song is great ,i wish i could give more than 5 stars."
5,Essential Mood Music found here...,"This album is by far one that is necessary for any cd collection. Robert Smith's lyrics, though dark and moody, reflect so much of what can be felt and is so easy to relate to. This album is perfect for late night listening, and reveling in a dark, less than perfect world. It is not one meant to cause depression, but merely focuses on the pain and heartache brought on by love. This album is a favorite and unlike any other. So rare is an album that touches one to the very depths..."
5,Onírico,"PICTURES OF YOU is the most romantic song ever.FASCINATION STREET is the closest sensation to be drunk or to a trip.SAME DEEP WATER ... is one of the best transcriptions to music of loneliness ever done.This album is full of sensations and colours.This music brings you to another world with a careful listen.RS at a highlight of expression, not only of himself and his band but of modern music history so far."
4,You probably already know,"Interested in this at all? You probably already know the album is great then. It's a bit overkill with the extra discs of live music and demos, but if you are really a big fan of the Cure or just the Disintigration album, it might be worth the cost. Liner notes are interesting on the making of the album and the package includes the original artwork from the first release of the album plus a bit more artwork added in. The album still holds up today with its lovely dark vibe. If you really want the full experience, listen to this album using Beats headphones."
5,The Best Cure and one my favorite albums ever.,This album is really amazing! I have outgrown almost every band I used to listen to but this album still amazes me every time I listen to it.Absolutely the best!
3,"OK, but understand what this is.","This 3 CD set is OK, but understand what you are buying. Disk One is the original album remastered. It is a solid 4 star CD and is well worth having.Disk Two, is mostly ""home demos, band rehearsals"". These are mostly instrumental versions with poor sonic quality that I cannot imagine listening to over and over. It's just NOT a pleasant listen.Disk Three is a live version of the whole studio CD. This would be great if these were inspiring performances, but they are not and do not offer much in the way of alternative interpretations of the songs. The live CD also brought to my attention what a limited vocalist that Robert Smith is. Apparently in the studio he can compensate for this, but in this live show, his limitations are very apparent.If you are a hard core fan of The Cure, you will probably want this. But if you just like good music, the original CD should be enough."
4,Great All The Through,Lost my original cd that I purchased back when it first came out. Very consistent work...wish they were more like this now.
5,The quintessential Cure album!,"This is by far my favorite Cure record. It's the only CD that I own that I don't skip songs on...everything flows, the mood is never interrupted, and the words conjure images as clear as photographs in the listener's mind. The Cure excel musically on this record as few bands ever will, and the poignancy and wistfullness of Robert Smith's words is touching, moving and exhilarating. Behind the tapestry of instrumental genius lies a raw emotion seldom found in rock music. I recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't already own it; this is one record that makes the listener participate in the artist's vision."
5,A trip down Fascination Street,"Ignore anything negative you read about Disintegration. Simply put, it is quite possibly the most intelligent and beautiful collection of songs in the history of rock. Robert Smith's heartfelt lyrics and emotional voice will reach your soul. Perfect."
5,The best album I've ever had the pleasure to experience.,"This is the most calming, relaxing and mood inspiring music I can imagine. Good for warm baths, candlelit romance, drunken rages...you name it."
5,this album is so great. im sad i didnt have it years ago.,I have always kinda known about the cure and have heard all there radio hits. But I wasn't really into them until a few months ago. But now I find there music is beautiful masterpieces. This album is a perfect example. I play it on surround sound at night with all the lights out and just zone out on the melody. Its pretty dark. Which I love. I can't really explain totally how I feel about this album. But I know it will never get old to me. I wish I got it sooner.PsI got the mp3 download because I wanted it right then but it is so good I bought the 3 disk special edition. Gotta be one off my top 25 albums ever.
1,Wanted the original,My bad for not reading. I overlooked the remastered part. The sample of the song I wanted had no words in it. When I listened to it I thought I was going to fall asleep. My real disappointment was finding that the original is not available as an MP3.
1,Do not order from Hastings,"I'd rate this zero stars if i could. I ordered ""The Cure: Disintegration"" on NEW VINYL. I received a USED CD. When I called, I was told I could return the item and they would expedite the correct item to me (this is a Christmas gift and I would now receive it after the 25th). Once I went to my email to print the return label, there was a note saying they could not exchange the item and I would just have to return the incorrect item. I am very upset with this poor customer service and such miscommunication. Now my boyfriend will not be receiving this item for Christmas, and Hastings is refusing to send the correct item"
2,Overlong and dull,"Puzzlingly popular Floyd-like prog rocker from Smith. Songwriting at an all time low with tuneless dirges such as the execrable 'Closedown' and 'Untitled'. 'Pictures of you' goes on and on boring the pants off the listener. This sort of filler would never have seen the light of day on early cure. Touching lyric on 'Last Dance' though. Only two worthy tracks are 'Prayers' and the title track but even that was overproduced. Talented and imaginative, Smith never had the juice for a long term carreer in my opinion."
5,"May not be good at first listen, but persist!","My friend recommended Disintegration to me a few months back. I didn't like it at first - I thought it was boring orchestral/rock music for 60 minutes. With every listen however, it has come to grow on me. This is now one of my most listened-to albums. My friend had the same exact experience too. So don't worry if Disintegration sits in the backburner of your to-listen. Just give it several more go's and I guarantee you will be hooked."
4,Disintegration in progress?,"Catchy and gloomy. In other words, typical Cure. Sadly, this does not live up to previous works. If you can ignore the decline of a great band you will enjoy this."
5,One of my favorite Cure albums; a good starting point too,"'Disintegration' is an album of lost love, missed chances, and bitter reflections (sounds like The Cure to me). From the opening wind chimes of 'Plainsong', to the lonely organ in 'Untitled', Robert Smith and his band create a lush soundscape of layered keyboards and gentle guitar lines. 'Love Song' and 'Lullaby' are wonderful breaks from the slow tempos and lush atmosphere and are wonderful singles, they're also great on stage. 'Fascination Street' is the closest thing to a rock song on here, with a hard-edged bass groove and lyrics that are more decadent and sexual than any of the other songs.'Disintegration' is a very consistent album (not as uniform in sound as 'Pornography') that holds up from start to finish its whole 72 minute duration. Depending on what you're looking for, it might take a couple of listens to sink in, and it does require a bit of patience."
5,speechless,I don't normally write reviews.. But Im making an exception for this. Nothing I can say would do this album any justice. But I will say this... Everything that is inside me is what this cd is. All the love and all the hurt and pain. Every single song is an emotional masterpiece. Definately a must have.
5,Blossomization.,"Until 1989's Disintegration, The Cure had always been underground music. This cd is an epic somber masterpiece. Sonically, I can't think of another band that has achieved what Robert Smith did with this recording. It's long, very long, but on rainy days, this is the one to listen to. I pick Disintegration of all the Cure's albums because there isn't anyone who likes the Cure that doesn't already know that this is a great album. I like all of the Cures' recordings, and I could have easily reviewed Faith, Pornography or The Head on the Door, but none of those comes close to this one. If you're not a Cure fan then get this one. The hits ""Fascination Street"", ""Love Song"" and ""Pictures of You"" are here as well as 9 other Cure classics. Now that Robert has decided to disband the Cure, they will go down in music history like Depeche Mode, Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits will/have."
3,Interesting,"Interesting mind bending music. It's different, but so depressing sometimes it's hard to take for more than 20 minutes. The music does mirror the gigantic angst that young people have, so much pressure on them these days and so much love and loss. This CD takes us through the ups and downs of an immature mind."
5,"""the soft and the black and the velvety""","Kyle of South Park called Disintegration ""the best album ever."" Well, it is definitely the best Cure album anyway. It is one of those rare CDs one can play with the ""Repeat All"" button on. There is not one weak track on the album. Each is a brilliant work of art. It makes for excellent background music as many of the songs clock in at over 6 minutes with long instrumental pieces before the vocals kick in (the opening track, for example, is that type of song with the powerful instrumental beginning that sets the tone for the rest of the album). There are also plenty of catchy individual tracks like ""Lovesong"" and ""Pictures of You."" Favorite tracks of mine are ""Prayers for Rain"" and the 12th track (not listed above) ""Untitled"" which is very pleasant. I recommend this album to anyone who likes rich synthesizers, heavy bass, and dark (but catchy) mood music."
5,Dead and dreaming,"This was my first Cure album, and the one that pulled me in and made me the fanatic I am today. There are no words to describe this, but I'll try...it's about love, and the death of love, and madness, and dreams and need...most of all need, and pain, and desire...beautiful darkness."
5,A definite clasic,"With the exception of possibly Last Dance, this is the perfect Cure album. None other can compare."
5,Life Altering,"This album is simply amazing. All the songs are so powerful and full of such real emotions. I'm the type of person who just can't cry, no matter what, it just doesn't happen, but this album makes me tear up every time I listen to it. My favorite song, on the record, is ""Pictures Of You,"" because of its increadable beauty and because it speaks so deeply to me (I think anyone who has gone through a painful break-up can relate to it). I recommed that if you don't own this album you buy it right this instant."
3,Do Not Disturb,This was one of the few Doris Day movies without Rock Hudson or James Garner but it was very enjoyable. Doris Day had very nice chemistry with Rod Taylor. And who can get past that cleft in Mr. Taylor's chin?
1,Total waste of Film,"There is little positive to say about this bad script, miscasting of actors and poor acting in general. I stopped the movie after about an Half Hour of viewing. This was a Birthday gift for my wife, who is a fan of Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Paul Lynne. None of who are on my favorite lists.The Best part is probably where it says, ""The End."""
5,Doris makes the day,Being a Doris Day fan all my life this is also excellent stuff. Can still recall this movie to this day. Still remember the title song Do not Disturb. For great escapism and good entertainment you cant go wrong.
5,Do not disturb Doris day,I had never seen this one which is unusual as I love Doris day movies ! This was funny romantic and had great chemistry between Doris day and Rod Taylor ( loved them in Glass bottom boat). I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
5,do not disturb,I love this movie. I use to see this movie went I was young and I was hoping this movie was going to be on DVD.
5,I loved this movie!,This is now one of my favorite Doris Day movies! Extremely funny! It's definitely worth the time to watch it!
5,Do Not Disturb DVD,It's another Doris Day flick and I couldn't resist it. Her wardrobe is wonderful in this movie. I is a screwball comedy about an executive and his wife who move to England
3,If you love Doris Day...,"This isn't her best film, she sings once (and sounds awesome as always) but the acting is solid. For me, this is another comedy of errors and misunderstandings and there are other films that do it better. A good rental."
2,THIS ONE IS EVEN WORSE THAN GLASS BOTTOM BOAT. DORIS DAY AND ROD TAYLOR.,"THIS one is the 1960's DUMB BLONDE, PAMPERED WIFE movie. Doris Day is married to Executive Rod Taylor. HE works all the time--SHE hangs around the mansion with nothing to do except dress up (A spectacular wardrobe is the THIRD STAR). I think this one is PRETTY BAD (except for HER WARDROBE). Stuff happens, but most of it is DRIVEL--not even worth mentioning.I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS. Good is good. Bad is bad. THIS ONE IS BAD."
4,classic movie,I am always pleased to discover an old classic that I do not own. Doris Day is one of my favorites.
5,Walnut Oil,"This walnut oil is very tasty, with a slight nutty flavor. This oil is very hard to come by and is very good in cooking and salad. This product arrived in a timely manner. I was very pleased with this oil"
2,Good Product - Not so Good Vendor,Using this product to cover wood project. Works very well.Ordered two cans - received only one - have made two requests for the other - both have gone unanswered.
2,has not arrived,I have not recieved this book it was to arrive with the book Earth. the arrival time has not yet expired.
3,pretty good,Pretty good book but not much in it about Spartacus. Its mostly about two other slave wars.
5,great debut,"Lisa is out of Luther's camp. She has been a background singer for Luther Vandross for many years. I love this debut cd, it's smooth, it's fast, it's jazzy. Good riding music, good dinner music, good everything music! Lisa has great range and the material is excellent!"
5,Lisa fischer: This Woman Rocks!,"This CD is a must have for anyone who loves singers who really can ""Sang"", and she's one of the best! Lisa Fischer could teach these young singers today a thing or two about singing,and even more about vocal control! With songs like ""so intense"",""save me"",and the Narada Michael Walden produced ""How can i ease the pain"", helping to make this vintage Classic shine,and one of the1990's best! Pure R&B gold! Luther Vandross is also a singer & co-producer on this CD,which just adds a cherry on top of this already soulfully rich,chocolatety delight!"
4,The most beautiful voice,"I just had to pick this CD up just to own it. Her voice is too amazing for words. This is what a real singer is supposed to sound like. To me, she is up there with Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Kelly Price, Deborah Cox, etc. I also love the funky early 90's beats."
5,So Intense,"I am not sure what happened to Lisa Fisher, but this is one of my favorite cds of all time and she has the most amazing voice. She is what is missing in music today."
3,Supreme Soprano,"Song#1 Save Me: A jungle of an uptempo jam w/humid vocals.Song#2 Get Back To Love: Bouncy joint with playful upper range.Song#3 How Can I Ease The Pain: One of the best sung songs ever!Song#4 So Intense: Average song graced with excellent vocals.Song#5 Wildflower: Classic song that blooms with a new twist.Song#6 Some Girls: Decent song with decent vocal display.Song#7 So Tender: Okay song w/classic 90's sound.Song#8 Send The Message Of Love: Song str8 out of Luther's log.Song#9 Chain Of Broken Hearts: Superb vocal range.Song#10 Last Goodbye: Haunting. This woman can sang!!In Conclusion, Lisa Fisher can definitely blow! Without a doubt she is one of the best vocalists out today. She just needs a better selection of songs and producers to match her vocal prowess."
5,Tracks,"1. Twas the Night Before Christmas (A Visit from St. Nicholas)2. Jingle Bells3. A Holly, Jolly Christmas4. Frosty the Snowman5. Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree6. Up on the Housetop7.

1,don't bother,"Hoped to replace an aging microphone screen with this one and eventhough it met the specs, it tore immediately and fell off - so - waste of money."
4,Works good.,Cable works as advertised. I don't really need 10 feet of cable but what are you going to do?
2,"Good stuff, but....","The Bible quizes and outlines are excellent, but I have a problem with this book. This book suggests that people should read from the New Revised Standard Version Bible which is known as the ""Gender Neutral Bible."" Some liberal churches use this for text during services. It suggests reading from translations that have problems with them. I am a person that is King James only."
1,Don't waist your money,"While the Fire Dancer is a great product (it works great and we love it), this Fire Pit for the Fire Dancer is complete garbage. Rarely have I felt so ripped off.The cast plaster stones don't look even close to stone, but I guess it's a good thing they aren't as there is nothing to hold them together (aside from gravity) and it might be even more annoying to put them back together after they fall apart from being slightly bumped.I would also think as they are just cheap plaster casts, one might actually be able to make them fit the product they were made to surround... But they don't. There's about a half inch gap all around where you can see through to the cheap legs the thing uses to prop up the Fire Dancer in the middle.Don't throw your money away. Don't buy this."
4,Great low heel for everyday wear,"I ordered these in brown and they are a darker shade of brown. I love the small heel, easy to wear all day without killing your feet. I have no complaints about the shoes, they fit great, they are comfortable and look cute."
3,clown feet,the shoes are cute but be prepared to have your feet look 2 sizes bigger then they really are.
1,Worst Book EVER,"If there was a 0 stars rating, this book would get it. How bad is it? When I sold it back to my college bookstore, I got a whopping $3! Even my crappy dreamweaver book netted me $5, but $3 isn't even enough to buy lunch. I guess it's all good, as I'd rather have my cheetos and Faygo than this book anyways. The numerous errors caused me to lose points on homework assignments, even though I did the project step by step as they are in the book. What a disgusting excuse for a text. And I've used lots of great books too, so I can tell the difference between one that has effort put into it, and one that's out of date and, for lack of a better term, a disgrace. I'm just happy I was able to buy it on the amazon marketplace instead of paying the $46 the college would have sold it to me for.If you get a class that ever uses this book, petition your board of cirriculum directors and have it changed, this book will help you learn javascript almost as much as a lobotomy will."
1,This book is a mess,"The first chapter sems to be ok, but once you get to chapter 3 you'll start to get confuse. I won't recomande this book if you are new to javascript."
2,JavaScript Complete Concepts and Techniques,"I have been working with this book for several weeks now...sorry to say the title is very misleading. ""Complete""? Maybe in concept only! The Shelly Cashman Series is usually very good, but the proofreaders were WAY overworked with this one. There are several errors in the tutorials that make it VERY frustrating to use if you are just learning JavaScript. I find the code testy enough without sloppy work on the writer/editors/proof-reader/publishers 's part. I have spent HOURS to get the tutorials to work, in some cases just having to cut bait. Folks at the publishers, take this one home and try it out. I'm tempted to send you back my corrected book with the multiple errors that I have found. Fix the mistakes and try it again. Gentle readers, this one is ONE TO AVOID."
1,"Errors, errors everywhere.....","I can usually forgive a few typos in any text, but this one not only has bad indexing, the code they have doesn't even work. Further, the authors are completely MSIE specific and don't bother to mention this minor detail. Save your money. This book is a complete waste of time."
3,A good book but not the best,"I like this series of books from Course.com. Because there is a lot of exercises for us to practise. Just reading is not enough especially in your work. After some practise, you can strength your skills and have confidence to tell everyone you have experience on JavaScript. A easy reading book for beginner. But it is not the best. I prefer to Javascript For the World Widw Web. And use this one as practise."
1,"Poor Book, wasting time and effort","This book was assigned for my internet course, and I found it very hard to fellow the programming code. They jumped up from no where, and the author did a poor job(or didn't bother) of explaining it. After I read the same project twice, still confused. If you don't know any JavaScript, it is not a good book to begin. I found it only wastes my time and effort, and the money to buy it. Don't choose this book if you have other choice. (I wish the teacher didn't choose this book! It is so frustrating to read it!)"
4,Nice gift,I bought this for my niece and she raves about it. non-stick easy clean up and good performance.
3,More humor,This is another humorous entry in the Liturgical Mystery series. I especially like the new lyrics written to popular hymns. They're hilarious! I will keep reading this series.
4,The Tenor wore Tapshoes,"Entertaining entry in the series with appropriate continuity to the others I have read. Many interesting characters and situations on edge of being bizarre, but just right for that mountain hamlet. The bad story within the story is particularly well crafted."
4,A Little Too Many Spoofs,"This entry in the series is a ""chuckle a minute"" like the others. However, I thought there were too many satires for one novel to handle well. Did we really have to have ""Puppet Ministry"", ""Iron Mike Men's Retreat"", and the ""Immaculate Confection"" all at once? That's on top of the corpse in the alter and the very bad Chandler send-up. Only 4 stars for having enough satire & humor for 2 novels, and for making this reader breathless, trying to keep up."
3,Not his best,"While I do still enjoy this ""X Wore Y"" series, this, the third book, is thinner (in plot) than the previous two. It's still fun. (For those who thought The Alto Wore Tweed was misogynist, the men's movement episode shows that Schweizer is an equal-opportunity skewerer.) The editing is still awful, but heaven help me, the dreadful story-within-a-story almost made sense this time. Either he's getting better or I'm fully around the bend at last.Nevertheless, it's hard to keep a rather limited running gag funny and fresh for long. Plus, for someone with Schweizer's knowledge and experience to make the common but amateurish mistake of confusing the Immaculate Conception with the Virgin Birth is simply inexcusable. That puts this book squarely in the 3-star category."
1,Broadcast Archives 2-Glenn Miller,"Very poor sound. I really like Big Band live broadcasts, but this one has the worst sound I have heard. You really take a chance when you order live recordings, especially if no music clips are available to hear the sound of the music. Be aware. I have been burned several times."
5,"Sifting through stories, myths, and beliefs about dreams","Threads, Knots, Tapestries: How A Tribal Connection Is Revealed Through Dreams And Syncronicities by Tess Castleman (a Zurich trained Diplomate Jungian Analyst), focuses upon ""Dream Groups"", and what Jungian analysis has to say about revealing and interpreting human psychology through the examination of unconscious messages. Sifting through stories, myths, and beliefs about dreams in order to better explore just what dreams can tell us about internal and external worlds alike, Threads, Knights, Tapestries is a superbly written and deftly presented analysis which is most especially recommended reading for student of Jungian psychology and psychoanalysis."
5,Composer,"Music for relaxation... while getting that perfect massage, while enjoying that lovely dinner party, while reading a good book. Trouble getting the kids to nap... try this music. Keep one in your car...this music is great when driving. Uncomplicated piano themes with orchestrated accompaniment make up these musical compositions."
3,Decent monitor,"Just got 2 of these. One connected to DVI and the other VGA on a ATI 1300Pro card. Both have minor darkening in the corners; one has some darkening in bands on the top and bottom; but both of these defects are very hard to see unless the display is uniformly white and you're looking at it from the side. They replaced a single NEC 1860, which was a great display, but very expensive. I tried a Acer 1914 first but that was real bad so I returned it. I'll keep these."
1,"super sarod, sloppy sitar",Listening to this cd one wishes he could just hear the impeccable sound of the sarode by Tejendra Majumdar and somehow be able to block the sitar. The playing of Tejendra majumdar reminds us of the Late sarode Maestro Vasant Rai who played the most beautiful meends and slides.Tejendra like Pandit Vasant Rai concentrates in the form and depth of the raaga unlike other sarode players who rush into fast techinical aspects right away. However listening to this album one can hear it is possible for a highly trained classical musician such as Tejendra Majumdar to be able to play with a non classical or folk musician like Shujjhat. An intresting duet would be Tejendra Majumdar and Ustad Shahid Pervez Khan Saheb (According to the times of india one of the greatest living sitarist) here Tejendra would be able to unfold his true abilities.I reccomend this album because the sarode is just superb
5,Don't order this. Amazon will send the wrong one...,Why does Amazon have so much trouble sending the correct product. This is not a game. This is a waste of our time.
4,Pursuing dreams in a simpler age,"Against a backdrop of the deadly struggles of organized labor in turn-of-the-century California, Jack London created an odyssey of two young lovers who pursue their dream of returning to the roots of their American pioneer ancestors. This book was originally written as a serial for Cosmopolitan magazine, and is reprinted in sections representing each issue. It is wonderfully illustrated by Howard Christy. Despite the xenophobia (quite common in the era), the book presents two compelling protagonists, and follows them in a struggle against union-busting bosses, poverty, and nature. The pages fly by."
2,"A very well written melo-drama, but no substance","I felt that the book was technically well written, but the story, subject, and outcome, were all very melo-dramatic and predicatble. The love story was unimaginable, the plot ""twists"" were that of a second rate novel, and the outcome completely unlikely in real life, even back then. I live in the California valley, and I have been through every town that is tramped through in this book, and only by Mr. London's sheer talent for writing did I keep enough interest to finish it. There are better, more rewarding books in London's canon than this."
2,The Valley of the Moon,"First, the book is filled with typographical errors, some bad enough to make it impossible to figure out what is being said.Secondly, London's writing is so repeticious in stating a point it would have made a better short story. It is difficult to rate this as a classic as it has not stood up to the test of time as great literature."
4,"An old book, one that I had missed.","Considering when this was written, I found the language interesting, especially the dialogue. A lot of discription of the early days of union conflict and the days of life in the poorer sections of California. A little slow going in places. I had to make myself keep going."
4,Jack London book.,"I read about a third of the book and have been disappointed. Not as good as ""Call of theWild"" or ""White Fang"". The book arrived on time and was in excellent condition."
3,Fantastical Fairy Story,"London gives a fine travel log of early Northern California. Some lives may have turned out this perfectly, but not many.Back to the land stories aren't new."
3,The Vally of the Moon,"The Valley of the Moon is a bit different than most of Jack London's novels. I was expecting something different, and I was not disappointed. I spent about half the book trying to figure out how Saxon and Billy would actually make it to the moon. I was expecting something along the lines of The Scarlet Plague, that is science fiction, but got something entirely different. For my taste it was a bit disappointing, still it was a pretty good read but not quite as good as his other better known works."
2,Does not have shutoff,"Unit shipped is not unit pictured, there is no shutoff switch. The picture accompanying this description is different from the picture in my orders history."
1,Check your camera manual first!,Amazon lists this as the AC adapter for the Canon Powershot A510 but it is not the right one. The voltage is wrong and the plug is to big.My A510 manual lists the ACK800 as the correct AC adapter.So check your camera's manual to make sure this is the right one for you.
3,Why should this be so expensive?,"I can understand having a charger for a laptop, but this I don't quite understand; at least not for this price. I would highly suggest getting some good rechargeable batteries (Powerex or Eneloop) and a good charger (MAHA or La Crosse). Right now I'm charging the batteries (energizer) for my camera, and all my other batteries are in use. I figured that getting the adapter would be useful; but now that I've seen the price, I have to reconsider. I'm just going to buy eight rechargeable batteries. That way I'll always have a charged set, I can use them for other purposes should the need arise."
2,Quality: High; Value: Not Worth It,"Note that I'm reviewing the value, not necessarily the quality of the product.The PowerShot A620 that I used this with has excellent battery life with Lithium or rechargeable Nickels, so, while the power adapter works well, it's not worth it unless you're doing a lot of shots or are doing a lot of flash-intensive work from a fixed location (near an outlet).For about half the price, though, this product would feel much more justifiable for a purchase."
2,If You Need a Good Nap.....,"Watch this video, but only if you need a good nap. We have tried two videos from this series and couldn't make it through either (we watched most of it). Besides being extremely boring (bad background music, voiceovers most of the video, and cheesy animation), there were very little tips to prospective travelers with children. No prices were ever given for any of the activities (general prices at least) and way too much history was inserted into the video.I gave it a two only because they did cover a fair amount of places to visit, several of which seemed pretty cool. Unfortunately, very little detailed info was given and it seems these folks are using their kids as props for their boring history/scenery videos. I would not consider this a video about traveling with kids- the kids just happened to come along for the ride. I sure am glad I rented this from the public library!"
1,Cable is crap,"We plugged this cable into our midi board and the computer only received one out of every 8 to 10 notes. We purchased a Yamaha cable and everything worked fine.But since we opened it, they wont take it back and we are stuck with a useless cable."
1,"This book is poor work with lot of inaccuracies in translation, look for a better book on this topic","It is a well known fact that Mr. Trump had very little knowledge of Gurmukhi, so this book is not a scholarly work rather a poor quality work with bundle of lies, hearsays and inaccuracies in translations. If you are truly interested in reading English translations about Sikh Scripture, there are much more accurate books available about the Sikh Scriptures. Do not waste your money and time on this work. Mr. Trump was a person with questionable motives. This book does not serve the purpose of educating or enhancing your knowledge about one of the youngest and spiritual (faith and philosophies) ways of life"
2,Review 2,Book arrived in timely fashion but quality was average as some of the pages were coming out of the binding.
2,Hmm.. Head Scratcher,"This will be short and not so sweet. I was disappointed in this book for one reason, it read like a text book, and a very boring text book at that. I don't mean any disrespect because I know this work took hundreds of hours, and the information was very interesting, but like I said it was boring and I had to struggle through just to finish it"
1,"This book is about some cranky old bore, not Jean Shepherd.","I bought this book hoping the author would get to the heart of Jean's unique philosophy and discuss Jean's opinions and wry humor. Instead I got some sketchy details of superficial themes often slanted towards a portrayal of Jean's alleged bitter side without any details on how or why it came to be. Considering Jean made a career on broadcasting offbeat ideas, I was very disappointed with the authors choice of banal topics, e.g. Jean disliked commercials, Jean didn't get along with some of his coworkers.... yawn.I'm not sure what this book was supposed to be, but it was not a biography, not philosophy, not anthology. Whatever it was, it wasn't an enjoyable read, and not one that gave me any deeper insight to Jean Shepherd. I was going to give three stars, simply due to the choice of subject matter, but on further thought, I have to agree with the 1 and 2 star reviews given here."
2,"Excelsior, You Fathead! Missed a lot","I was very disappointed after reading this book. A lot of good information about the life of Jean Shepherd was left out. Many details of his life were either missed or overlooked. I would hardly call it a biography. Most of the details were left out. After reading the entire book, I said to myself, ""Is that it?"" Hopefully someone will write a more complete story of such a man that was larger than life."
5,Great Dish,This dish is great and I use it all the time. Also cleans up great. I love the Caribbean blue color.
1,Broke in Oven,I bought this item on March 28 2011. I had no problems the first time I used it on Mothers day for my yeast rolls. However today I used it in a 350 oven and it broke in half! I called the company today and they are sending me a new one. I was told NOT to put it into a pre-heated oven! The This seems like a crazy request to me. I would not buy this product again.
5,An excellent dish,"This baking dish is exactly what I wanted it to be. The perfect proportions and an excellent grade of stoneware, which is to be expected from Le Creuset. Very glad to have made this purchase."
5,Shirt,Cutter and Buck makes the best pique shirts for me. I would like a light brown but can't seem to find it.
2,Would have been a 3 star if.......,The music backing is rather rich and professionally sounding actually. But what kills it is that the first line of EVERY SONG is SUNG by a singer presumably to provide a lead-in for the users of this karaoke. It just destroys the entire purpose of karaoke which is to have pure music backing just so the user can sing along to it.
1,NOT A KARAOKE CDG>>>ONLY MUSIC!!!,"This is NOT a CDG, so all you get is the background music. THIS STINKS!!!DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS YOU KNOW THE WORDS BY HEART"
2,The American Patriot,"The book was fine and arrived promptly. The print in the book for some reason was very light. Still readable, but not as dark as one would expect."
3,"Good, but not her best work","I love Tracey Chapman - but this CD is just OK compared to others she has cut. ""New Beginnings"" in my opinion showcases some of her best work."
1,Too Racist and Political,"Enjoyed her first album. So I bought this one thinking it would be good as well. But, she's taken a bite out of the Racist/Political pie. Most of the songs take swipes at White Men and Conservative viewpoints. Same thing happened to Iris Dement when she compromised her style for her political viewpoints....She bombed. This is a stinker except for a select few including ""All That You Have Is Your Soul""."
2,Eh.,"Looks like I'm in the minority on this one, but I'll say my piece anyway.Crossroads, the title track, is why I bought this CD. I heard it on the radio and decided right away I'd have to own it.I should have bought the MP3 track and saved myself the trouble of downloading the entire CD onto my computer. I deleted every one of the other tracks after listening to them. My reasons:A) Tracks 2-9 all sound the same, and none of them sounds anything like the title track. Not even a little.B) They're badly mixed, with the volume difference between voice and music hugely out of balance. If you turn it up loudly enough to hear the music, the voice is overpowering. If you turn it down low enough to be able to enjoy Tracy's incredible voice, you can barely hear the music.C) Along the same line as 'B', the music in 2-9 is minimal, barely audible acoustic guitar with little to no accompaniment.Very disappointed. Still glad I have track one though."
2,The songs sound the same,"I just put this CD into iTunes and my impression is you've heard one Tracy Chapman song you've heard them allat least on this CD, they pretty much all sound the same and not that great either."
3,A few gems in the mix,"I bought this for my daughter because I remember loving it when first came out.The songs were soulful and melodic, a great second album for this young rising artist at the time. I could play ""bridges"" over and over again. I have to admit though it's a little bittersweet revisiting this work after all these years. It's kind of like seeing an old friend years later. Its sweet but you can't fully recapture what you had because its clouded by time. Maybe that's just with this album though. It is a bit melancholy. Still worth a listen."
2,Great Cast; Dreadful Recording,"This opera is extremely hard to find in any sort of decent recorded sound, and this recording isn't it. Which is too bad, as it's a terrific cast. But you can't tell. Keep looking."
2,Where's the rest of it?,"This show is NOT 47 minutes long. It's just a segment from a longer show, maybe 11 minutes or so."
4,"Great Guide, Fun Story",I've played and enjoyed all of the Kings Quests games. This text provides as a decent guide and includes a story-book like telling of the game. Very fun.
2,Not a good substitute,"An employee at Sephora recommended this conditioner to me as a replacement for my Dr. Hauschka lip balm stick. It was around the same price range so I bought it. It leaves a white film over my lips and makes my lips peel. However, it isn't completely useless, I use Cauldie's lip conditioner to remove all the dead skin from my lips and then put my regular Hauschka lip balm on (now that I can find it at Whole Foods). I won't be repurchasing this item. It's a shame that I couldn't share a wonderful experience like everyone else had. It just goes to show you, product react differently on people."
1,Not for me!,"This lip conditioner made my lips really dry, i have no idea why! I tried for 2 weeks and it was really bad."
2,Buy Petroleum jelly instead - costs way less,This simply felt like a lighter petroleum jelly and was in a tube. Been using it for a week and notice no difference. Easily wears off in five minutes. CLinique's lip scrub made my lips feel better.
4,Quantum Leap - Dreams,This is a bit different from other Quantum Leap shows in the fact that it's length is shorter and the plot is a murder mystery. Its a good who-done-it movie with a turn of events that is surprising. I had never seen this episode on TV so it was totally new to me and I did enjoy it.
4,One of the best,"This video is very good and interesting, because it is defferent from other episodes of QL. It is cute to see Sam's vonerability and Al is there for Sam as usual. As also in many other QL episodes in this it is not only about the plot itself, but about the friendship between the two men.I recommend to buy the video and enjoy one of the best episodes of Quantum Leap."
5,Not only on Broadway,"This is pure Broadway gold. Other posts have said all I could have, but what may not be known is that the troubled show also had a production in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia at the same time as the Broadway Production. The Garnet Carroll organisation must have felt highly enough of it to buy it before it struck all its troubles on Broadway. They imported Sheila Smith, who was very fine in the role. (She later popped up I noticed in ""Sugar"" on Broadway). I would like to report it was a great whopping hit in Oz, but sadly I don't think it did any better than on Broadway. I saw it - young as I was - and just adored it. It really deserves a revival. Very much in the vein of ""Singin' in the Rain"" with perhaps the satire even more sharpened."
3,The Skeleton Key - sounds of the old South,"Dark, stormy listening to take you to the marshlands of New Orleans - at times, clearly a soundtrack, but with tracks from the likes of Robert Johnson and the hoodoo beats of Iko Iko, you'll suddenly feel an inkling for Gumbo like a true bayou-dwelling Creole."
5,great resource!,work smarts for women is a great resource for employers and all working women in the united states. it is well written and simple to read. it offers a complete explanation of our complicated discrimination laws and the process developed by those laws. real life stories of women who suffered discrimination are used to show how the laws and processes work. paniccia's hard work should be appreciated by both employees and human resource departments.
2,Not a good tool in language learning,"First of all, the use of the word ""tópicos,"" which in Spanish is more commonly used to mean clichés, makes me feel uneasy about the validity of this book. The word should have been ""temas,"" which is a more standard way to refer to ""topics.""I would not recommend this book. The readings are too basic and even limiting. Instead of reading texts on terrorism, for instance, written my the makers of the book, I would have liked to seen the implementation of ""realia"" (texts coming from the real world, news, etc.)."
4,Good for vocab and ideas,"This book is handy for those intermediate level Spanish speakers who want to increase vocabulary about certain topics. The ideas are not very sophisticated at all, but it presents ideas from different perspectives, and provides some decent vocab. I've been using it to prep for the Foreign Service Spanish exam, and it has proven helpful. It doesn't cover enough abstract ideas for the 3 level, but it gives enough vocab and grammar to help you get there."
2,Is each edition really different?,I wonder how different each edition is. Does each new edition have completely new articles?
4,Math Made Easy:Third Grade Workbook,"This workbook is a great supplement to 3rd grade math. The pages are colorful, entertaining, challenging and a great way to continue learning during the summer months. There are rewards stars for every page, which the kids love to put on their pages for a job well done."
1,not happu,This is a workbook. I planned to use with my daughter. I cant however because it is completly filled out. Waste of money!!!!!!
2,High Hopes,"I had high hopes for this workbook, based on the sheer number of lessons, colorful cover, and price. At first, I was disappointed by the ""slick"" pages that don't hold pencil well. It doesn't matter how hard you push on the pencil, you still can't see the writing very well. Erasing, even with a good quality eraser, is impossible and just leaves smudges. I was going to use this (along with manipulatives) for our main math curriculum, but there was next to no instruction and I found it to be a little too fast moving. I ended up giving these books away. I would only recommend using them as a supplement by topic, not as a methodical, cover-to-cover workbook."
3,not what I expected.,It has a lot of practice but nothing where my kid can have some fun at the same time.. Great for Robots lol..
1,VERY BAD PURCHASE!!!!!!!!,"THIS PRODUCT DOESN'T WORK. DATES BACK TO THE 1970. KIDS CANNOT LEARN FROM SOMETHING SO OUTDATED!!! TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND SOHAS THE MATH PROGRAMS OVER THE YEARS! AS FOR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. STINKS, I PURCHASED THE DVD, THEN DECIDED TO RETURN THEM SINCE THEY WERE SO OUTDATED, AND THEY GIVE YOU A CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AND NOBODY EVER PICKS UP A PHONE, YOU LEAVE SEVERAL MESSAGES, BUT THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOSE ALOT OF MONEY, PLEASE DON'T BUY THESE DVD'STHEY ARE A WASTE!!!! AS FOR ME I HAD TO DISPUTE MY CC IN ORDER TO HAVE SOMEONE RETURN A CALL, SO I CAN GET AN RA# FROM THEM TO RETURN PRODUCT. WHAT A JOKE!!!!!!"
2,Something Missing...,"I recently purchased this workbook and was generally pleased --until my third grader began to practice her multiplication tables. We were both very disappointed to learn there were no worksheets for times tables for the 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's. I couldn't figure out why they would be omitted. There were worksheets for the 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's and 10's. I was quite surprised and felt that rendered this book incomplete. I had to purchase yet another workbook with a complete set of worksheets, but this time I went to a bookstore so I could inspect the entire book to ensure it was complete."
3,Very disorganized book,My only problem with this workbook is that information within it is not organized. All math topics are mixed up and it is very hard to nail any specific math task without jupming 20 pages at a time.
3,"Ok, but we need more","This book is ok for my 8 yr old grandson to do 'review' with, but it just doesn't have enough practice for each skill set. One or two pages on multiplication then on to division, etc. Just not enough for our needs."
4,the definitive guide to literary agents,"This is probably the best available book for people (like me) who are in search of a literary agent. It consists of short, just the facts ma'am, listings with all the basic data, e.g., name, address, name of the contact person(s), listing of recent sales, whether or not you'll get hit up for a fee, etc. This book's big weakness is, not surprisingly, that its compilers take the agents' side rather than the writers' side, which means that the info tends to be very bland. Another big weakness is that many prominent agencies (e.g., The Wylie Agency, the Endeavor Agency, and a number of others) are not listed at all, because they asked to be left out, in order to minimize the number of incoming submissions."
2,Pleasing To Look At - But Just An Advert For Pro-Pipe,"At first glance this book seems impressive - good illustrations, easy to read and seemingly well organised. The problem is that it purely focuses on using the Pro-Pipe software and doesn't mention any other software (like CADToolsonline, Hercule Design etc).If you are going to use Pro-Pipe then it is worth buying but otherwise stay clear."
4,OK.,I bought it because it was prescribed by school where i was learning Pipe Drafting. and it was available @ better price than in Store price.
3,quality control,I've had to send back 3 of these already (scratched pickguard and neck pickup down inside the body) Musician's Friend's policy is to keep shipping out a different one at their expense rather than open the box to see if their stock is defective. I'm waiting on #4 to arrive. The price is right only if you get a good one. Otherwise it's not a good value after paying a repairman to fix it.
1,perfume imitacion,"me enviaron un perfume de imitacion olia muy mal, nada que ver con el buen olor del portafolio original. agradezco para la proxima vez envien perfumes originales"
5,One of the Best Albums of All Time,"This was my FAVORITE album in the early 1990's and 9 years later, it is just as awe-inspiring as the first day I heard it. This is the Pixies at their best. Though it's not as rockin' as their earlier stuff, it's moody balance of pop-ish tunes and darker songs (such as ""Tame"", and ""Silver"") is both enigmatic and evocative. Definately one of the best albums EVER produced!"
5,The Miracle of Pixies,"Pixies was a miracle, Doolittle is a miracle, very, very, very surprising album, of course they had other releases before this one but Doolittle was ""the masterpiece"" time, space, mood, stars lined up to create the miracle of this album, 90s changed for sure mostly because of Pixies and nobody can deny it , specially if David Bowie states that this band were one of the most innovative he had ever listened in his entire life, alternative rock concept gained a new dimesion after this release.HM"
3,This is a good album,"If you're in junior high.Really, there were much more important bands at the time (slint, the fall, sonic youth, half japaneese). while i'm not denying the pixies' importance, i have to say that there are better things going on, and that this isn't even their best album (see surfer rosa.) what you need to do is see if you have a copy of slint's spiderland album. if you don't, buy that album instead. i promise that it is a million times better than this. or buy some music from NOW. the new chicks on speed is amazing. the new modest mouse and shellac records are good to. there is a lot of good music being made right now. you should be buying that instead."
2,You have to be in the right mood,"With the exception of a few tracks, this CD mostly consists of noise, dissonance, and screaming. Definitely better than nu-metal, but still not something I listen to on a regular basis. It's not bad if I'm in a really grouchy mood and need to let off a little steam."
1,Nevermind the Pixies! Boring!,I agree with the last reviewer who said a Phil Collins for the Nineties not even as musically sophisticated as Phil Collins.This album puts me too sleep!
5,"""You Can Gouge Away....""","If there was any band who just didn't seem to care how strange or noisy they came off, it would have to be The Pixies. But what they created was brilliant, offbeat, and catchy music. Good luck trying to figure out exactly what Black Francis' (now Frank Black) lyrics are about with his twisted tales and weird lines. The music is flat-out amazing rock that was very ahead of its time. Yeah, this was released in 1989, but it still sounds fresh today. The musicianship in the Pixies was great and it's a shame they are no more. At least they put out this excellent piece of work entitled Doolittle. Check out the Frank's psychotic chants on ""Debaser,"" the dark and twisted ""I Bleed,"" ""Wave Of Mutilation,"" ""Hey,"" and the classic ""Monkey Gone To Heaven."" Hey, even the most accessible song, the poppy ""Here Comes Your Man,"" oozes with originality. If rock these days is bringing you down, take a trip back to 89 with Doolittle. And give it a few listens if it doesn't sink in at first."
5,"This is what ""classic"" sounds like.","I recently popped Doolittle back into my cd-player after leaving it for a few years. Each time I come back to it, it sounds completely fresh. More than 13 years old and it still blows away everything labelled ""alternative"" today. The Pixies made it look easy to be emotive, silly, funny, and sexy all at the same time. Black Francis sounds a bit like Adam Sandler, but he grabs your attention in a way that's urgent and never annoying. Kim Deal's bass and vocals round out the mix perfectly, as in ""Tame""'s breathy chant or the sweet chorus of ""Here Comes your Man"". Doolittle's dementia never comes at the cost of impeccable musical sense--that's what makes it so astounding."
3,..,"This album is pretty good, but I feel it's overrated. While some tracks are great, others are just...well, bleh. Lots of people told me I would be amazed when I got this album. I guess my expectations were a bit high. It's still good, and an enjoyable listen, but not what some people make it out to be."
5,best album by the pixies,"give this album a few listen-throughs and you'll know why they're one of the best bands ever. their influence on nirvana, weezer, everyone is incredibly obvious after you've obsessed over this one for a minute or two."
4,Doolittle does a lot,Classic Pixies album is one of my favorites!!! there are a few rarities that are on this album that you can't find anywhere else.
5,Simply brilliant.,"It's been said, but I will say it again. The Pixies were so far ahead of their time that it frightens me at certain times, and awes me at others. I cherish this cd as one of my most prized possesions, it truly is difficult to describe this wondrous album without the beneficial effects of a hallucinagen."
4,What a nice souvenir,"Being a native Californian, I was immediately attracted to this book. When I opened it, I fell in love with the wonderful little watercolor illustrations and personal journal format. I agree with a previous reviewer who made the comment that this is a nice little souvenir book. It's definitely a worthy addition to the bookshelf of any Californian or someone who just loves California."
3,"Not bad, not good",I actually don't like this book very much and wish I hadn't wasted money on it. It's kinda cute to look through but just not that interesting and I live in California so I should like it but I don't
4,reviewer's delight,"I usually like American Dad, but this episode was kind of a turn off. I don't really know why? Maybe is a lacking of Roger being really ""Roger like"" I don't know, but I didn't really dig it."
3,Decent series,"This is by far my least favorite of all seasons, though it still has very good moments in it they seemed to be having issues getting stuck on the same subject. Season 6 however is my most favorite I cannot wait till it releases. 6 kept allot of well rounded topics that are fun."
3,The same as vols 1 - 4,"Okay, I've watched all volumes of AD.It's the same joke quality as vols 1 - 4 except there are no racial jokes.I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I find AD boring now. This is the 5th DVD of AD I bought."
3,American Dad vol 5,"The volume it self is great just as the other 4 volumes. My problem lies with the fact that i waited over an extra week for it to show up only for it to show up with a very broken case, the third disk cant secure in place so is slightly scratched and the center piece holdind the first and second disk is also broken and cant be secured properly. Ended up waiting for the release of the dvd here in Australia just so i could buy a quality product."
2,Doesn't fit on my lap!,"I'm 220 lbs, but I'm 6' tall.... and this thing won't fit on my lap. The part that is supposed to set on your knee misses it completely. I can only imagine if you are shorter or of the plump variety.Perhaps it's due to a 17"" laptop.... or a large belly, but, hey... we're not going there on this review.Where's that RMA number?"
4,Laurie's music,"My mom got the CD from a friend and I like listening to it. Most of the time I like the backstreet boys and nsync, but I can't listen to that when I do homework. My mom said it might help me focus. It sort of does. There aren't words to think about and the music is quiet, but not too quiet, so it's cool."
5,You'll keep coming back for more!,"In my six years of study as a post-graduate Theology student,I have read many books introducing me to Hebrew Scripture. Many were excellent and scholarly yet none possessed the ""flow and enticement"" of Collins' research and presentation. I looked forward each night to resuming my study. Collins managed to tie all the information together, fill in all the gaps, present many perspectives and offer the latest assessment of the evidence thus far. I teach an Adult Bible Study - and ALWAYS have this book at my side. It's as pleasurable a read as it is informative!"
1,Rude and Shortsighted,"Collins' book is a shortsighted and often rude introduction to the Old Testament and its corresponding history of interpretations. Collins treats his modern vantage point with such arrogance that it is simply embarassing to read him dismiss the OT as 'legendary and folkloristic' without providing evidence for such claims. Certainly there is better scholarship out there, if at least more humble. Teachers and students can do much better.At the time of this writing I am a Princeton Theological Seminary student."
4,"Good book, unusable CD-ROM","The text is a superb overview of the Hebrew bible, appropriate for an undergraduate course, personal reading, or an introductory graduate course.Lamentably for an era of inclusiveness, the accompanying CD-ROM is Windows-only. It will not run at all on the Macintosh operating system! I asked both the publisher and the developer for a Mac CD-ROM, but one is not available"
5,Arguably Linda's Very Best...& that's saying alot !,"Being a fan of LR since the '60s with The Stone Pony I think I can state with confidence & experience that this may be Linda's pinnacle CD of all the many, many wonderful ones over the years. She truly is one of the queens of Rock & Roll as well as a fine balladeer, stylist, Broadway Baby, oopera ingenue & many other things. I had this first on cassette tape when it came out (1989) & I liked it well enough. But on revisiting it recently (CD) I was blown away....WHAT a VOICE! And to be paired with Aaron Neville...WOW ! Could this be heaven ? LOVE IT ! GET IT ! *JTQ"
5,Can't wait to get this!,"I'm just ordering this. And I'm getting it based solely on hearing the song Goodbye My Friend. I lost my dearest friend 8 years ago (incredible it's that long), and this song can bring back the gut wrenching tears like it was yesterday. She's amazing!"
5,One of the very best!,"Sometimes the song and the singer come together in a way that puts everyone else's efforts to shame. This is one of those albums. From hearbreaking (Shattered) to heartfelt (All I Know) to the most infectious, bring-the-house- down rhythm & blues (When Something Is Wrong With My Baby), this album is the perfect sampler of Ronstadt's many styles, all excellent vehicles for her stunning voice."
1,Bad Rheingold Mastering,"I had looked forward to this set esp. after the wonderful work Archipel had done with their mastering of the Knappertsbusch 1952 Parsifal and Meistersinger. However, the Rheingold suffers from the same terrible remastering that afflicts their 1953 Forza remastering. On headphones the voices are all shoved over to one side with the orchestra on the other and there is artificial reverb added - I understand the last three operas are better but I didn't bother . A disappointment."
3,Best Remastering is on Opera D'Oro,"This 1953 Ring may well be the gold standard of recorded Ring cycles. But for vastly improved sound, voices particularly, go to the new edition (Feb '06) from Opera D'Oro. For some reason Borders does not list it -- but it's easy to find elsewhere. And the price is in the $45-55 range."
4,Parents happy,"I bought this for my parents as they had recently moved from California to Conn. They love this book as it has allowed them to find some great bedroom communities nearby.A true review would be from someone who knows the area, but for outsiders this was a great purchase."
4,"Great Soundtrack, but this one was a boot-leg","The actual soundtrack is a wonderful soundtrack, and the copy I recieved had not flaws in it. However, it should be known, that this is not official in the least. Great buy, none the less, but I know some people are a little touchy over that sort of thing."
1,DO NOT GET!!!,there are alot of these pirated cds going around on here and unless its american DO NOT GET IT!! its some wierd unofficial cd.
4,If you love Zelda....,If you love Zelda this record is for you. It's music directly from the game so if you want to learn the songs then its perfect. If your a causual fan it is definitly not for you.
5,A great soundtrack,"If you enjoyed the music when playing Majora's Mask, this is for you. However, if you don't like bootlegs in your collection, then prepare to be disappointed. Chances are very good the CD you're getting is published by Miya Records, a well known bootlegging company. Check with the seller and they will tell you if it is from Miya Records. If this does not trouble you, then you should know that Miya does a fantastic job making the CDs look professional, though the album art has obviously been copied. The sound quality is very good for a bootleg. I would say 4.5 stars because it was illegally produced, but I'll round up to 5 because the music is that good."
2,What the?!,"Who is this? I thought I picked up the latest PM5K CD, but instead was left with 13 tracks of something I hadn't heard before...and didn't like. ""Transform"" is the most appropriate album title since Megadeth's Risk.It seems like Spider went out of his way to NOT sound like his brother this time. This about as metal as Metallica's Load album.If you're new to PM5K, skip this and pick up ""Tonight, the Stars Revolt"" instead."
3,a fun listen,"i knew when i bought this that it wasn't gonna be metal or all that heavy. but it's enjoyable; something fun to crank w/ the windows down. the songs are catchy and i really like the dude's voice: kinda a less edgy MM. so if you like your rock via punk, this isn't bad at all."
4,Great to Okay,"I didn't know too much about Powerman, except for the very cool videos I'd seen for a couple songs from ""Tonight the Stars Revolt."" (which I picked up back at it's original release--it's also good) After catching ""Transform"" on the radio, I decided I needed to try the new one out.At first, I wasn't overly impressed, but after listening to it half a dozen times, it grew on me. Well, actually the first half grew on me. I love the first half of the disc, through ""Transform."" After that, it starts to slide. The later songs get a bit loose and just don't have the spark of the first ones. I honestly could listen to the first seven or eight songs on repeat for hours at a time.All-in-all, a good CD to pick up as it's more than just a couple songs (though the good ones are great). ""A is for Apathy"" in my opinion is by far the strongest song on here, followed by ""Transform."""
5,great,"This is a great CD. Spider One has very strong, growling vocals, and not even close to a 2nd rate Rob Zombie. The guitarist and bassist are both pretty good, the guitarist actually has a sick solo on ""Action"". This CD is alot different from their previous ones, they gave up the whole space man thing (""Transform"") and the result is their best work to date. Whether you liked their ones before this or not, I would recommend this CD"
4,Better than AFD?,"Alright I own all PM5k Records And I must say Transform is Better than anyone for doomsday That record sounds to much like Marilyn Mansons work (kinda,take another listen you might agree) I mean transforms songs go deeper its a more personal record I think transform songs just sound a heck of alot better And I dont think AFD is that heavy to be honest Spider just does his low creepy voice threw most of the record and then you get some stupid meaningless courus There all good albums but this one sits second To Tonight the Stars Revolt For sure"
3,"O.K., thats about it","I've only listened to this a couple times, so maybe I will change my opinion, if i do i will edit my review. In the mean time, I think this is a good radio album, but if your expecting the heavier edge of Powerman, its not here. Other than being more mainstream, I also thing he needs to stop getting help from brother rob, there is 2 songs on this album that sound like Rob's ""dragula"", and ""boogie man"" songs. I have always loved powerman 5000, but some of the songs on here i could really do without. They are walking a very fine line between hard rock and pop right now!! If you like songs like ""nobodies real"" or ""worlds collide"" then you probably will not like this"
5,What a rock record should be.,"The band that brought the world 'True Force', 'Mega Kung Fu Radio!!', 'Tonight The Stars Revolt!'and the scrapped 'Anyone For Doomsday?' has finally released a new album. And it was worth the wait. This is an amazing album. I feel it's the best Powerman 5000 album to date. I've heard many whine and complain about them toning down the sci-fi stuff they had going on, and for the life of me I can not understand why. 'Tonight The Stars Revolt!' was a good album, but why so many 'fans' want to just hear them retred the same ground over and over again is beyond me. If a band wants to stay vital, they must continue to grow. And that is 'Transform'. 'Transform' is growth, something PM5K has always done. I can't wait to hear what they sound like 2 or 3 albums from now. Get this cd."
3,Its an ok album,"What I dont get is why all the changes it was going good for them. Another thing I dont get is that when Metallica put out Load and Reload they got bashed hard unlike PM5K who are getting praised for this work, I liked the old music better but this one is good on a different level."
5,Transformation of Powerman,"All I can say is YES! This is a Transformation, no doubt, but, they have not lost their style or theme. In my opinion, Powerman has never changed, only their songs and their members. So they lost the spaceman get up. They changed their appearence after Mega Kung Fu Radio as well, yet they didn't change themselves. Lose yourself, and you loes it all. Powerman 5000 hasn't lost anything, and they never will. I love Tonight the Stars Revolt and Anyone for Doomsday, but this is just as good, and a welcomed change. PM5K will live on no matter what they do."
2,Should have been called songs for a hypocrite,"What do you call a band that ditched everything original about them to write about selling out? How about a band that makes fun of other bands that they imitate? Or a band that talks about how it isnt important to fit in, when they scrapped their last cd because is wasnt the cool thing in the metal world? You guessed it, Powerman 5000. Unless you like generic anti-corporate music, avoid this cd."
1,SO Disappointing :(,"OMG. I was a huge fan of TTSR. I was devastated when they pulled AFD from the shelves the day before it's release. There's no simple way to put this....this cd BLOWS. These songs lack energy, intsensity, and creativity. I don't know what the band was thinking...but if this was the direction Spider wanted to go, then I can totally understand why the 2 other members bailed. First off, this cd is NOT metal...not even close. It's pop rock at best.If I can stress one thing...SAVE YOUR MONEY. Download three tracks and that'll be all it takes for you to understand what I am saying. I cannot understand how other people have given this four or even five stars. It must show their musical tastes. There should be a NO - Star rating...and this album CERTAINLY would've achieved it.I feel betrayed. As a fan of the sci-fi...and the pounding riffs and space imagery of TTSR...even accepting a ""transform""ation...this CD [is bad]"
2,Too Bad,"I'm sad that PM5K has changed. The album that was supposed to come out before the line-up change was supposed to include the single Bombshell. In fact I have heard many of the songs that were supposed to be released but never did because of the line-up change. Although Free is a great track, probably the best one on here, the album just feels like its lacking something. The industrial edge that PM5K is known for. Overall this album really isn't that bad, and I'm sure that alot of you are going to like it. I recommend you listen to the samples or ask your local record store to let you listen to it first before you buy it. It's definently different. I'm biased because I was looking forward to the release that we will never see. This probably would have been a good follow up to that album. Ah well, what can you do?"
3,Indeed there was a transformation...,"Alot of people enjoyed Tonight the Stars Revolt, and well the style has definately changed. Anyone For Doomsday sounded great, I'm still wondering how they could even pull it. But anyways I would say that PM5k's Transform is ""OK"", the songs sounded very catchy but lack of well....good lyrics. After listening to the cd the first time, it took time getting used to it. As I kept listening to the cd several times, some of the songs grew on me. I gone from hating the cd, to actually liking it. There were some negative aspects about Transform, the lack of that sci-fi theme and tencho effects, but I think whats more important is that they are trying to convey their message about society. That'll do for me, I just hope they will pump out something better produced next time. I'll give this cd 3/5 stars....."
4,Huge improvement,I haven't liked a PM5K release since Mega Kung Fu Radio. Tonight the Stars Revolt was very one dimensional and I completely understand the need to change. This CD is a vast improvement. The songs are catchy and well written all the way through. I bought this and the new Deftones at the same time and was pleasantly surprised by this and horribly disappointed by the Deftones. Didn't expect that.
4,A Change,"I think that Transform is one of the best PM5K ever, but it doesnt beat Tonight The Stars Revolt. The promoting track ""Free"" is the best PM5K track ever released. My favorite tracks on the album are Free, Transform, Thats Entertainment, A is for Apathy, Theme to a Fake Revolution, and Song about Nuthin'. I did like the Spaceman music a lil' bit better, but in the music business change is always necissary and I like this change."
4,Plenty of Action!!!,I've been a huge fan of powerman for a long time and iam gonna go see them in boston in july i think transform is better than ttsr because they sound alot better with the punk rock vibe than the sci fi vipe both albums are great but i think transform has a shaper edge.Spider is hands down better than rob
5,an eye opener,"A Question of Intent was given to me as a gift - and I must admit it has been one of the best presents I've ever received. I was born and raised in Kentucky and have long known the hazards of smoking. This book has painted such a clear picture of how tobacco was manipulated and produced as an addictive drug. I think that it should be required reading for all middle and high school students. Dr. Kessler has clearly told the story and the background of this ""deadly industry"" and I praise him for his fortitude and perseverance."
5,The Texan,"I used to watch this show when I was a teen-ager. It was nice seeing it again. The price was good, too."
5,gooo deal,Purchase this as a gift for my husband and I can't seem to get him off the couch now. He loves it and I am not sure if he knows I am still around. Will order more
4,correction cast disc 7,ther cast listing for disc 7 of the texan is in error. on border incident claude akins stars. alan hale jr is in texan episodes about building the railroad but this show concerns Longeley hiring out to arancher who is a crook
3,A Special Work,"As the most of movies on a Jewish, especially, Jewish-Orthodox topic, this DVD is heavy overpriced-but for some special reason in this case.A Jewish orthodox family has lost a sole only son-an eight year old ubiquitous boy to an ocean on a community trip to a beach while father was praying on a shore nearby. A last movie minute depicts mother pushing down holy books from a synagogue female section balcony as a sign of becoming non-believer, or?Probably, this work targets at the first stage rather a narrow cycle of viewers upholding a life-style screened.Very good performing."
2,Disappointingly thin,"I was hoping that this book would provide details of the historical background of the trilogy, and place the literature in the context of the events it represents. Instead, the historical information is about what one would find in a typical encyclopedia article on Poland. The rest of the book consists introductions originally written for the three volumes of the trilogy in the Kuniczak translation, but no longer published with them, and some discussion on the history and problems of translating Sienkiewicz. These latter seem intended to glorify the Kuniczak translation, but I for one was not convinced by the examples provided. I read With Fire and Sword in the Curtin translation and The Deluge in the Kuniczak, and I was put off by the modernisms and obvious inserted connective material that appears in the latter.On the other hand, it was fun to read about how Sienkiewicz produced his work, and his relationship with his contemporary translators."
2,Rhubarb Jam?,"I was very disappointed in this product. I love rhubarb, and it's hard to find rhubarb jam, and then when you do it often has strawberry in it as well. Since this was straight rhubarb with no other fruit, I ordered four jars of it.It is very very UN-rhubarb tasting, in my opinion. It's not bad as a generic sort of jam, but, had I not know it was listed as rhubarb before I tasted it, I wouldn't have been able to guess.Admittedly, I don't have a great sense of taste, but I had some of my co-workers taste it, too, and none of them felt it was particularly rhubarb-y."
5,"Power-packed with the ""RIGHT STUFF"" to defeat the devil!","Reading this book opened my eyes even more in recognizing the enemy and what he and his spirits try to do to the saints daily. This book re-affirms that God has not given us the spirit of fear. Reading this book assists in ""polishing"" the armor that we already possess and making us strong soldiers in the army of the Lord."
5,"Subtle, evocative, powerful","Town and Country's first record on BoxMedia (""Town and Country"") showcased a acoustic quartet utilizing doublebass, piano, harmonium, guitar and trumpet. ""Decoration Day"" has an expanded palette of doublebass, piano, kalimba, snare drum, guitar, harmonium, celeste and accordian. The quartet utilizes drones and repetition in a way reminiscent of John Fahey and Morton Feldman but with results that are entirely fresh. Fans of Jim O'Rourke's acoustic recordings (""Bad Timing"" in particular) will find this a welcome addition to their collection."
4,"Glass Hammer, cars, conspiracy and big computers","The Glass Hammer is a completely freaked out story about a guywho is trying to break out of a quasi Religious/political web in hiscar. Think of Mad Max or Death Race 2000, but written by someone who is very paranoid and complicated"
4,Just right,"I recently received a older smart phone, and I was not able to sync it to my PC. This cord has been the perfect solution. I allows me to plug in the charger, so that the phone stays charged and up to date all at the same time.Thanks,"
3,Moist and pretty tasty...,"They were very moist with lots of topping and lots of product. I wasn't so fond of the vegetable-fat type of taste, however, as it tastes so commercial. I prefer my treats rich with the taste of butter. They were pretty good anyway, and all were eaten."
3,"Fascinating, But Spinning Out of Control","The previous book in this series, Hannibles Children, started with an interesting premise, which was the Romans coming back after a defeat in the Second Punic War. The Seven Hills seems to be spinning out of control, though, in unbelievable directions."
3,SHADOWS FALL...starting to lose their edge!,"Don't get me wrong, this is a solid album with lots of heavy riffs and good overall sound. BUT, being a huge SHADOWS FALL fan I see a little less and less old school in ther songs. That was one of the most appealing things about the band was old school thrash,with new style sound,gave them something all their own. I just see the band slowly going in a more ""listen friendly"" direction. SORRY GUYS, but a power ballet on this album just didn't cut it. I admire the lyrics,but a different style could have been used. Honestly, I would have given it 4 stars but skipping over that song every time gets old. In closing, we all know what happens to bands that get to commericial. ""METALLICA...WHO""!"
3,Disappointly Good,"I want to see Shadows Fall blow up even bigger, I really do. They deserve it. They write good music, plain and simple. This album though is not mainstream enough to make it big, but not old school enough to please most fans. It kinda falls in the middle. Failure of the Devout and Burning the Lives are by far the biggest standouts. Great songs. The other songs are good, but expected. Redemption and Venomous have great highpoints. Another Lost Hero is nice, but eh. Final Call is their biggest filler track since Montauk. I still like this album, but like The Art of Balance, I am disappointed and feel it tries too hard."
5,AMAZING......SHADOWS FALL AT THEIR FINEST!,"Ignore the one or two negative reviews about this cd.....any Shadows Fall fan will agree that this is an amazing piece of work. Just listen to the first two songs and you will be hooked. The cd is loaded with tempo changes, excellent guitar harmonies (and typical SF shredding), excellent vox by Brian Fair. Excellent production work without sounding overproduced (like Lamb of God's last cd, although I still love it).Every song on here does not sound like one another, which was a big complaint with fans who reviewed the past two cds by them.What more can I say? Buy the damn thing and you will be banging your head like crazy......"
1,Same old stuff,I don't understand how bands get away with this. Every album sounds the same. War Within was a great album but this is so watered down. What happened? And some review said that Brian can sing well. Are you kidding me????? He is a below average singer and it works well with them. That's all. Not great. It is what it is. But this album is not good by any means.
3,Major label=major changes,"I'm not sure what CD the other reviewer was listening to. But I could quickly hear changes to Shadows Fall's sound and style upon listening to this new offering.The first thing that stands out is the vocals. Brian screams less and ""tries"" to sing more. Maybe Atlantic wanted something more mainstream here. Either way, the old style isn't completely abandoned, but the vocals are not as brutal/heavy.The guitars are very good again, but seem to lack that kick, or for a lack of a better term, an edge that seperates this offering.While solos abound, nothing here grabs your ear.The songs overall are good - however, three records from now, I doubt Shadows Fall will play any of these songs live except maybe for ""Redemption"" - the CDs first 'single.'That all said, I still like it....but I see this CD falling into my collection, rarely to be heard again."
1,"They got Godsmack disease, same riffs, same melodys","ZERO inspiration here. I kinda liked their last album a little but the guitar players (while technicaly sound) rehash the same riffs and pinch harmonics over and over and offer NOTHING new. the vocals and the same thing. Listen to the last album and you will here the same thing especially redemption which seems to be their favorite chord progression!To date they have pushed 59 thousand copies. There's no way a major label is going to put up with this. bye bye shadows fall, your not even close to All That Remains."
2,Boring....,"Threads of Life is really disappointing. Shadows Fall once showed great promise. What happened? We get the same guitar riffs, same song set up and same bad vocals. Brian Fair has to be one of the worst and most predictable singers out there. Anyone who has seen them live (like me) can tell you that. Guitar work is good but we've all heard this before. Nothing new or innovative. Some solid but predicatable drum work. Do they have a bass player? Metalcore is on its way out.Stick with ""Art of Balance"" or ""The War Within"". Or save your money and buy the new CD from Machine Head or Dark Tranquility.."
3,What's going on?,"I was expecting Shadows Fall to break free from the trend of this year. They did nothing close to it. The trend I'm talking about is great bands putting out sub-par uninspiring albums. Mastodon, Lamb of God and Trivium all had big follow ups to put out and all of which fell short of achieving anything comparable to earlier works. (in my opinion anyways). If you were disappointed with The Crusade, Sacrament or Blood Mountain then you wont be too fond of this. If you like this new direction then dive right into this album. As for me, I like Threads of Life but it's forgettable. I said that about all the afore mentioned albums and all of which are now collecting dust in my closet. Blah.. Someone point me towards something good please."
3,Decent...,"but not as good as previous efforts, especially ""War Within"". The variety just isn't there in my opinion. Sadly, the only tracks that really stand out are the single ""Redemption"" and ""Failure Of The Devout"", an attempt at fast-paced thrash. The remaining songs sound bland to me. The person below me brought up Trivium and I must admit, this album does not come close to being on the same level as ""The Crusade"", especially where musicianship and variety are concerned. It sounds to me like the band is holding back a bit compared to previous efforts."
3,Thereads of Life. The song really dose remain the same,I do like Shadows fall. But I havent herd anything really chang since Art Of Balance. There not one of those bands that can just Grind your head off (even thats gets old sometimes) I fell that If I want to hear them I would rather hare Art of Balnce. Plus I fell there a bit overated. Their nowwhere near Bands like Old Metalica Death Slayer Even win I did hear Art of Balance I never thought it was there. I thought in time but now that thought seems to be a disappointment
3,Disappointment,"I had ordered this and a few other charms for Christmas. They were shipped, IAW Amazon/Pugster on 24 Dec. I still have not received them and it is 8 Jan!!!"
4,Not bad for the price !,Just picked up my unit before Thanksgiving. The setup and hookup was fast and simple. With my I/r whole house link I can control and watch Tivo/Direct-TV from any TV. (...)
1,Philips is the worst!! NO Stars!!,I've owned two of these and both broke within a year!! save your $$. I will never buy another Philips product!!
1,Died 2 months after using it.,"After only 2 months, it was fun while it lasted. Now I have to exchange it for a new one. That cost me $25 to do so (shipping). I just wish I read the online reviews before committing to this Tivo Receiver. I wouldn't be suprised if my new one does the same thing."
3,Born to Die,"I have nothing but praise for the concept and operation of the Tivo. Going back to find out what the heck that person in the previous scene said; watching a favorite show when you want (without going to the trouble of actually doing anything). What could be better? BUT, I think this model is poorly engineered. It gets too hot! I thought so when I first installed it (Nov. '00). Although I was careful to situate it away from any sources of heat and in a well-ventilated area, it died in nine months. Since I had purchased a three-year extended warranty, I figured that if my fears were realized, I could simply replace each model as it died. But I discovered that a three-year extended warranty with The Good Guys (the retailers) was ""fulfilled"" (read ""canceled"") with the first replacement. The next time the DSR6000R dies I will replace it with two units, a separate satellite receiver and a separate Tivo. I would recommend this option to everyone."
2,beware Tivo lifetime service subscription,"I purchased a DSR6000R to replace my older 30 hour standalone Philips Tivo that failed after about twenty months of use (it was somewhat flakey over the last few months and then completely died). I had purchased a lifetime subscription from Tivo and fully expected to be able to transfer it over to the new receiver. I was informed that this was not possible and that I would have to return the original Tivo to Philips for service or replacement. As I had thrown away the old one, this was impossible, but they still would not allow me to switch over my subscription. In retrospect, I presume they expect most of their lifetime subscriptions to expire with the original equipment. Decided to return my new Tivo and try UltimateTV instead."
3,TiVo fading into....,"I bought this appliance last week and as is my luck, the price has been reduced ..., AND on top of that I see today where TiVo is coming out with TiVo 2, the upgrade (with the ability to record on one channel as I watch and/or record another-the ultimate convenience) everyone wants and I held out two years for - but could not make my self hold out any longer.I find this appliance to be relatively slow in response to commands from the hand control, something that is irritating after using Directv and or cable.The small hand control is awkward for people with large hands, as I have, and key buttons are illogical placed causing many incorrect commands being sent to the appliance."
5,If you work nights you NEED this.,"Many of the other reviews has said already just how great TiVo is. Let me just add this: If you work any kind of night shift, this will allow you to once again have a normal tv experiance without the hassle of a vcr. TiVo has changed the way we watch tv so much that we are going to buy our second unit soon."
3,Big problem for sports fans,There is one serious problem for sports fans - the PhilipsTivo does not show a sports channel listing(the 700's) until a half hour before games time - so you cannot set it to record a game before going to work. They have been working on fixing this for months but still haven't done it. They claim Directv is not giving them the data they need. It seems like a problem that could be easily fixed.
1,DO NOT buy this product!,"DO NOT buy this product unless you enjoy inconsistant tuning, restarts that take forever, waiting 45 minutes for customer service to pick up your call, and customer service reps who only read from the same users manual that you have.I even gave these folks a second chance by swapping my first unit with new one. The same tuning problems are coming back. I have FOUR other DirecTV tuners in my house and they have zero problems. The same tuners work superbly in the location of the DSR6000. This product, and its support, are junk. I only hope this review spares others from this truely miserable experience and waste of my money."
1,Defective Unit,"After 3 days of trying to get my reciever to call Tivo and literally hours on the phone with tech support, they determined the unit was defective. The installer rolled his eyes when he saw that it was a Phillips Tivo unit and said I should have gone with Ultimate TV."
2,2 stars and 2 thumbs down,"Lets face it, if I buy a unit with 2 tuners, I expect them to both work. They say that there will be a free software upgrade to get the other one to work, but they do not say when...can you say ""sucker""?The UltimateTV version will have 2 working tuners and also internet access. That's what I'm going with."
3,Not quite there yet.........,"all of the reviews and features offered in this section are correct, except perhaps the most needed feature has yet to be made availalble. That is, can you record a program while watching another program? No you cannot, unless you have multiple boxes. Directtv is attempting to address this issue. Adding dolby digital sound compatibility was a giant step forward."
3,Don't put it in your bedroom!,"It's a computer with a hard drive, running 24 hours per day. The fan inside the unit is quiet, but not so the hard drive itself. If you power down the unit at night, it can't download the program information via your telephone line. Fine features, but keep the Tivo in your living room, not your bedroom."
5,This cd is great don't be fooled,"I Have read the reviews, ""this cd is not as good as their other ones"", "" ther sellouts , Blah Blah Blah. Truth is it is different, and its a great different, band still can rock. For all those people who still need heavy, well i prefer this over someones garbled screams for an hour, slap it on a cd and its ""heavy metal"". Slipknot's latest cd had the same reviews when it came out so don't trust all that you read. I guess some people just prefer to listen to bands scream and ramble through a whole cd!"
2,Big Disappointment.......,"Very Important: Before you buy this album, make sure you listen to other songs besides ""Happy?"" and ""Determined"". I heard both of those songs and was pumped about this album months before it was actually out. I wish I just bought those two songs via mp3 for 99 cents each instead of paying 15 bucks for this garbage.I'm a metal fan, I love everything from Killswitch to Lamb of God to Slipknot. I simply can't relate to the lyrics to this album, (""Eeeny-Meeny, Minee, Mo,"" anyone?) and Chads screams drown out the sludging, sloppy riffs that sound like nothing more than a super-heavy jam band. I swear that they only focused on those two songs I mentioned, then the rest of the crap they came up with on the spot and called it good. And the music industry wonders why people ""steal"" music. It's because who wants to pay 15 bucks for two decent songs and have the rest just complete garbage?Yes I'm in a bad mood, and you may be too if you jump like I did."
4,this is good music.,"Wtf is wrong with some of u guys? Yes, i agree that this album is slower and more melodic, but this is good music. I'm some how ashamed that some of u guys think L.D. 50 or Iowa is super ""heavy"". That's NU METAL. If u want to listen to REAL heavy music, grab Pig Destroyer, Cattle Decapitation or Cannibal Corpse. Now that's heavy. Stop bitching guys...Best Tracks:JustDeterminedForget To Remember"
3,Hard and raw with a few poished,"I like the more produced songs and for some reason hate the standard metal scream songs. Do to the variety this album is a kinda like it kinda don't album for me. I'm glad I bought it. Song Happy is by far the stand out hit on this album, It appears to cater to both the heavy metal heads and the more pop metal heads,most should find something to like here."
3,Not the best Mudvayne cd but still a very good cd !!,"I still remember going to one of my greatest shows of my life it was the LD50 tour(2000) and they played this tiny club in SF called the pound.......that show was in my top 10 of all time. i`ve been to over 300 shows since my 1st back in 1982 Judas Priest Screaming for vengence tour.....Screaming for vengence its not.......but,,,still a very good cd.....3.5 is my rating."
2,worst mudvayne album,"this ablum is okay but it is too soft, the only song i like is Determined, the song Fall Into Sleep could be a song for Hurricane Katrina because it talks about dreams of disasters like Hurricanes."
3,Mudvayne goes mainstream,"This CD just does not compare to the old style of mudvayne. Every CD before this was awesome, but this one just seems to be aimed more at the masses. Before it was like mudvayne didn't care if anyone liked them, and it was awesome. I give it a three because i still appreciate their talent, i just do not beieve they used their talent as well as they could have or have done in the past."
3,=/,"With this album, Mudvayne sinks further into the hole of predictablilty and just overall blandness that has overcome most of the metal scene. While their first two efforts (especially LD50) were pumped full of creative progressiveness, this album just falls flat after the first few tracks.An overall dissapointment."
2,What the hell....,"This CD makes me sad. You can tell that chad, ryan, matt, and greg went with a different aproach on lost and found. On each of this band's two releases after L.D. 50, it is apparant that they are an evolving band (which they have every right to be), and i was somewhat a fan on EOATtC, but this CD is a disapointment.LD 50 is one of the most innovative CDs ever created, and EOATtC showed they weren't afraid to do something different,...BUT IT WAS GOOD. If the lyrics on lost and found were a car...they would be a bike...a huffy. SOOO all in all wtf mudvayne. i got respect for ya, pull it together on the next one. rent it for a weekend, but not purchase worthy."
1,Disappointing,"I'm sad to say i'm no longer a fan of this band anymore. I remember when i first put LD50 in my cd player and was blown away, in fact LD50 is still one of my favorites. That is why this cd is such a let down.. and the same can be said about The End Of all Things to Come.This cd is just weak, the only remotely good song is Determined, which is ok at best. The rest is just whiney and boring. Too bad because i know mudvayne have heaps of talent at their disposal. If you want good Mudvayne buy L.D.50"
2,"It's alright, but i wouldn't buy it again...","There is something about this album. I bought it expecting it to be heavy but the only song that i thought was heavy was ""Determined"". Though that is not the best song, it is the heaviest. ""Happy"" is one of my favorite songs ever recorded! I just don't like the album. I would just borrow it from a friend before i bought it. If you want something heavy, buy Slipknot's self-titled ""SLIPKNOT"" and ""IOWA"". These are two really heavy albums."
2,title of review,"It sounds a lot like their last album, except everything is watered down. The production is less heavy and dense, and the songwriting is really simplistic. I don't know how they could be happy with these songs and consider them worth releasing. It's such a huge step down from their last album. It's not like they're trying anything new either. This isn't a failed attempt at expanding in a new direction, it just seems like they're not trying at all."
1,The end of good music from Mudvayne,"I've seen a lot of bands ""develop"" their sound and become more melodic, but I've never seen one turn from a respectable, progressive metal band into the pussies they became on this album. It's ridiculous- I can't even listen to this album, with the exception of ""Forget to Remember""(I pretend it's not Mudvayne). I don't know why I feel compelled to write a review on this album because I'm almost at a loss for words as to how bad it blows- maybe I feel obligated to warn Mudvayne fans from five years ago not to purchase this steaming pile of pop garbage. As bad as this album is, I still listen to L.D. 5.0 and the Beginning of all things to end, and both of these albums are phenomenal and I would highly recommend anyone who doesn't already own them to do so and leave this album on the shelf out of protest; I wouldn't even burn this thing- unless there's gasoline involved."
3,Decent Effort Or Maybe I can't get over LD. 50,"I love Mudvayne their a great band with great singing, lyrics, guitars, and drumming. The album fits well together and Their are some stand out songs such as ""Determined"",""Happy?"" and ""Fall into Sleep"" are my favorite songs on the album but I occasionly will listen to ""Pushing Through"" and ""Just"" this album is still great I just compare everything Mudvayne does to ""LD.50"" but still this album is still well worth your money."
3,it's not bad....,"My first impression of this CD was that it was a ""polished turd"" If I were to write this review within a week or two of my purchase, it would have been quite negative. However, the CD has grown on me somewhat. My first few listens everything sounded forced, and un-inspired. Sometimes things sound like that the first few listens....so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and kept throwing it in my CD player....eventually the songs grew on me more and more....but it's still one of my least favorite releases from them. If your expecting another LD 50, then you will also be dissapointed. This album easily compares to ""the end of all..."" which was also just an okay CD. I think alot of it has to do with my personal taste changing from nu-metal to swedish death metal....But I can still appreciate the bass, and drum duo in mudvayne, some of the better in music."
2,mudvayne,"The Mudvayne CD lost and found contains catchy riffs and cool bass lines.Songs have decent groove expecially determined, imn and few episodes from other songs.Or, the basist is awesome , but guitar work is not that interesting... drummer is ok.Also , this guys have heavy sound, they go for comercial mainstream sound.And for fan of technical extreme metal this is may seem boring, but you download can few songs online....5/10 or 2.5/5"
1,Mudvayne has been castrated,"I just bought this CD today with confidence that it would be cool. I really liked all the other mudvayne CD's alot but this one is trash. Theres no reason to buy this. If you want to hear mediocre guitar and bass riffs with whiney tool rip-off vocals and scary little kids singing in the background, then this is the CD for you."
2,Awful,"I greatly, greatly anticipated this album, and well, the anticipation is always sweeter than the reward, it seems.Plainly, this album blows. LD 50 was a startlingly complex and original release for a genre that was destined to die off, and their sophomore release was only a few steps behind. While TEOATTC was technically sound, I never cared for it much, and was jittery when they announced this new album would be a return to their experimental, neo-progressive sound.If anything, this album is just Mudvayne fattening their wallets and equally fattening their chords. The ruthless complexity is completely gone, the lyrics are blatant and angsty, and the bass has been completely buried (although the bass lines on here aren't standout anyway...).Mudvayne may have removed their stage antics and image from the equation, but everything that would appeal to a devoted fan of their early sound has been trashed as well."
1,Whats wrong with you people??,"Because of you bands like Inflames, Soilwork, Dark Tranquility, and NightRage will never get the praise they deserve and instead we get more albums by these clowns and their clones. Ive seen these guys live and Chad only did half the vocals while the guitar player did the other. It was lame , they played for an hour and a half and only gave INflames a thirty minute spot. For shame.Go buy the new NightRage or InFlames. Hell go buy anything besides this. Nevermore, ShadowsFall, Killswitch engage, Lamb Of God, Behemoth, Bloodbath, anything besides this."
1,this sucks more than slipknot,"my friend brianna loves this band and is going to see them live soon she said too me give it a go, let it seep in, well i tried really i did,...but after the tenth time of trying i gave up threw the cd out the window in a rage,well i learnt something from mudvayne it's all rage and no talent, just mindless bass slapping growled vocals, STUPID songwriting just awful..raged music with no skill anyone could make s**** like this..but it takes a really special band to make it good MUDVAYNE they make s**** sound good to there fans..when really it's empty mindless rage POOR excuse for a band..and album"
4,Worth the money,"Although to me it lacked a little in comparison to their othger work, it is a more radio friendly mudvayne album. Great songs and it is easy to see why it was a success and got more airplay."
4,God Help Close Minded People,"I was reading eveyone else's reviews about Lost and found, and a number of people keep saying that this album sucks,and it's not L.D.50. This album is not L.D.50, hint the album name isn't the same. I think the band is reflected more in their music in this album because they are truly lost and found, they ditched the fake names and are standing proud behind their real names. They are also standing behind great inovative music. If your looking for another album that sounds like L.D.50, i recomend getting MuDvAyNe's ""End of All Things to Come"" album. Don't get me wrong though this CD is very good. It's hard to compare them and this CD to any other band i've listend to. They still have that harcore heavy sound but took it and mixed it with softer melodic parts, so when you listen it picks you up and lets you down for four minutes. I would definitly recomend this cd to any metel listener i think it is a good , solid album, easy to listen to from start to finish."
4,sell out?,"i don't usually review CDs on amazon cuz it seems like a moot point, if you dig the band you dig em, if ya don't then ya don't, plain and simple...you think mudvayne is metal?...ha, you're funny...our radio stations around here don't play mudvayne, MTV doesn't play mudvayne...if they're selling out they aren't doing a very good job of it...i love this CD...quit crying cuz it's not LD 50, if a band creates a CD that sounds similar to their last one, they get spit at for not having any originality, they change their sound a little bit and they're selling out?...get a grip on reality kids cuz i'm dying for the day MTV plays IMN...determined, pushing through, happy?, imn, fall into sleep, choices, and forget to remember are among the best tracks mudvayne has ever put out...they changed their sound, get over it"
3,bleh,"It could just be me, but Mudvayne is growing tired. Your basic stuff included on this latest installment. Listening to the transformation from LD 50 to End Of All Things To Come, you could tell where they would head into this release. Not saying it's bad, just nothing spectacular or groundbreaking here.....""uggghhh!!!!!.egad,mudvayne are yet another lousy,noisy and terrible nu metal band along with posers like slipknot,limp bizkit,blink 182.there are no melodies or any guitar solos in any of the songs.the music in this stupid album is horrendously bad.this album sucks!!!!!!!.get never say die or the mob rules from the great black sabbath instead.this horrible mudvayne album is A MUST AVOID""--Blasphemy, when i think of great Sabbath albums Mob Rules is not even on the radar, Dio is better suited singing about dragons in his own band... you want a Sabbath album listen to Sabatoge, Vol.4 or Master of Reality."
2,"World owes you recognition, but you owe yourselves progress.","It's trite to re-interpret the title into the critique, but I can't help regarding `Lost and Found' as all too fitting. The best aspects seem like B-sides, while the other two thirds remind the world why radio-potential metal has become so disposable.And Mudvayne is supposed to help us forget.It's painful to imagine that they've hit a creative wall, worse to conceive that they would weaken themselves so as not to intimidate promoters, but I hear those riffs that were worn out 20 years ago and I just don't know. The experimental sharpness is still floating around in here, but it's measured with points rather than an edge.Gather the mob-funds, guys. But come back and remind us how much more you have to give."
5,Lost & Found,"This album is killer. The opening track is outstanding, can't stop listening to it. Sure, songs like ""Happy, Forget To Remember"" sound like radio type songs but the rest of the album does not. Hard hitting songs all around, every band changes it's course every once in awhile. We as fans and listeners have to adapt to the change. Mudvayne did in this album that and it worked in my opinion."
1,mudvayne was cool,this cd sucks. saw them in concert in ventura a couple years ago. it was the loudest show i've heard. there was pain in my body. this new cd indicates to me that i will not see that show again...
2,"Well, it's Mudvayne","I have every Mudvayne album, because I keep hoping that they will stop having 2 or 3 good songs per CD and come out with a full good one, and this just proves the point once again. And I also find it amusing how they change their image after every alubm. First they are aliens or whatever, then they're some kinda Kiss look alike with face paint, and now they are Hardcore, but at ozzfest they're still pullin gimmicks with bleeding masks? I don't think they even know what kind of band they want to be but I wish they'd stop messing around and dedicate their time to msuic instead of a halloween costume."
3,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:more singing, lyric sheet, a bit more experimental elements being tried outbad side:not a huge improvement from previous album, no band pictures includedstandout tracks:fall into sleep; all that you are; happy?; tv radio"
5,Edward Delaney's great book; its great..... he's my father,"This book by Edward J. Delaney is the best book I have ever read. He must have worked very hard to acheive his dream. He is a very hard worker and is very determined. His book is inspired and everyone should read it. You will feel better once you read each story. You will feel how he felt, you will feel is dreams in your mind. thankyou."
2,Flawed,"Useful for details of personnel and units, but marred by fantastical inaccuracies in accounting of claims and losses."
1,Yuck!,THis guys' voice I found annoying and the cadence with which he used to try to hypnotise you was the worst and found it more annoying than the other CD I purchased. He sounded like the actor doing the Visine commercial and that was not relaxing. I would not get this CD again or reccomend to anyone.
4,Great Little TV,"We purchased this Sony after buying & returning an Audiovox under-the-counter tv/radio. We were very unhappy with the picture quality of the Audiovox, so we went to Best Buy and looked at their system which was a Phillips. The picture was much better than the Audiovox. Yet, we were still not satisfied. So we purchased the Sony system, which is better than both of those. We are very happy with both the picture quality and the sound quality of the Sony. It's perfect in our kitchen. The only issue is that you need to buy a right-angle wire connector in order to hook up the cables in the back -- no big deal, my husband got it at Radio Shack. We even hooked up a little dvd player to this system. Just a note, we don't leave the dvd player plugged in to the outlet because it causes some interference when you're not using it. I don't know if this is specific to my house outlets or if it's something with the frequencies of the tv. Anyway, we are extremely satisfied with this product!"
1,After 30 minutes the TV went black and never recovered,"After 30 minutes the TV went black and never recovered. Further the provider Sandadeals did not honor a return as they have a no return policy per Amazon. Makes it tough. Sony will only attempt a repair or give a refurbished unit. The downside when a product fails, its better to buy from Best Stores."
1,Good...untill it stops working!,"Installation was not difficult with the right angle coax connector. We would use this unit for approx. 10 or 15 mins in the morning. We were very pleased with it's performance untill one day we pressed th ON button and nothing happened. No clock, no radio, no CD player, no TV, no power. We have had this thing for 8 months. $200.00 for 8 months of service. That doesn't rate very high in my book."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!,"Unfortunately, Sony has stopped making this product. The TV function on my first one wouldn't transfer from the CD to TV (locked up and was apparently not repairable???), and I finally found another one on the internet as is the TV that I use most. The radio and CD player still play fine on the first unit. This under-counter TV has an EXCELLENT picture. It is in my kitchen, and I use it daily. No other under-counter unit had good reviews when I bought the first or second Sony. This product needs to be put back on the production line!!!"
2,"FM Poor Reception. ""Weather"" Not Available. Misrepresented. AM Antennae poor.","This is a big, big disappointment. I needed to buy an extra Am antennae to get it to work OK, and the FM still doesn't work and I have another radio sitting right next to it on the same counter and FM is as clear as a bell. I'm still trying to figure out how to get the weather band station, or looking back on the description, it includes the word weather, but it specifically does not state ""weather band"" so maybe I am expecting too much. I have yet to find it to hear it.As for slim, I have since looked at others in some stores and it is bulkier than many."
5,kitchen success,"I purchased this TV for my mom's kitchen. Picture is great, remote handy, mounted underneath kitchen shelf, connected easily to cable. The swivel of the screen is most useful. would definitely recommend again."
4,Be sure to check the width of your cabinet before your purchase,I found that my cabinet was a little small for the LCD-TV but was able to install with a few minor adjustments. You will also need to purchase an ell type adapter to attached to cable to the set. Overall the picture is great and the set works very well also.
3,I thought it had a DVD player too!,"I was in a hurry making Christmas purchases and just assumed that since this was a TV/CD player, that of course it was also a DVD player but it's not. I ended up having to return it."
4,Under Counter LCD TV/CD Radio,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter. It works well, picture is very sharp, sound quality good. I think they wish it had an IPOD dock as well But other than that, very satisfied. They did not have any trouble installing it and basic TV channels come in without cable hookup."
4,A nice unit for the kitchen,"The sound and picture quality is quite good.I give it only four stars because it has no battery backup for the clock, or radio presets."
4,Little Kitchen TV,"First, they quit making this one. Good luck finding one.Bad first:1) The jacks for rf and video are located at the back, sticking out the back, limiting you from mounting it flush to the wall, which sticks it out a little past the cabinets. Would have been nicer if the jacks pointed down.2) No digital receive. Had to buy a rf converter box to get any receive.3) No HD. Everyone is just spoiled on this issue. The picture is just fine if you remember what good analog looks like.Everything else is great. The sound is great, the radio is good, the CD player is good, but really, the best is the screen. It's convienent and can be seen all over my kitchen.Note: If you end up dealing with ""ruebean"" good luck on actually getting your product. It was a beating!!! Took 6 weeks, slow replies on emails and nothing but lame excuses."
3,Too deep for cabinet,"I'd had a GE unit that fit well but worked only O.K. when it stopped working I purchased this w/o checking depth. Jiggering it around and drilling through the cabinet frame, the unit still protrudes from under the cabinet and I still had to get a right angle converter AND loosen all the mounting screws and gouge the drywall to get it to fit. That's ridiculous."
5,Underrated hair metal,"Faster Pussycat broke a little late on the scene, after the long hair and tattoo bands all looked and sounded too much like each other(Kix, White Lion, Saigon Kick, Dangerous Toys). Maybe that's why they've been forgotten while Poison, Skid Row and Cinderella can at least get some time for nostalgia while few people remember Pussycat. Even at the height of their career, their best material rarely found the airwaves. That's a shame, because they produced some music that rocked just as hard but was much smarter and more fun than the rest. Another reviewer called House of Pain an anti-ballad. I'd add that Wake Me When It's Over is like an anti-pop album, because the best material is located deeper in the disk. Pulling Weeds is a balls-out romp, and House of Pain is a more sincere ballad than most bands of this kind could write. Poison Ivy was the catchy hook, but keep playing, or you'll miss the best stuff."
3,"From the ""Whatever happened to"" file.","Yes, Faster Pussycat is one of those bands that will be remember as a one hit wonder with the ballad ""House of Pain"" which peaked at #9 on the Hot 100 Singles chart. They failed to match the success of Slaughter, Warrant, Firehouse, White Lion, Motley Crue, Def Leppard, AC/DC and Bad English.This is from the ""Whatever happened to"" file."
1,Generic Sleeze Rock,"This is a bland and genereic late 80's LA sleeze metal album. Nothing here stands out at all. There are lots of pre-teen level sexual innuendos and riffs stolen directly from ""Rocks"" era Aerosmith. Taime Downe's voice is un-spectacular at best and seems especially strained on the lackluster hit ballad ""House of Pain"". ""Where There's a Whip There's a Way"" is a cringe-worthy sex anthem without even a decent hook to save it. The rest of the album shambles along a similarly predictable path and never comes close the legitimate frolicking sleaze the band's debut album. This kind of music doen't have to be intelligent, or even all that original, but it should at least be somewhat fun, energetic or catchy. ""Wake Me When it's Over"" is none of the above."
4,Faster Pussycat,"I was intrigued by this band hearing them on Hair Nation. This is a good album for any fan of 80's hair bands and has good cuts on it. Poison Ivy, Slip of the Tongue, and House of Pain are the most notable."
5,FPC's best,This is definitely Faster Pussycat's best album! It is a great collection of songs and they were one of the best glam bands of the 80s/early 90s. You can't go wrong!
2,Not the greatest,"This product isn't the greatest. It doesn't add a lot of shine to my hair it just makes it go flat .I prefer Garnier Fructis Style Brilliantine Shine Glossing Spray , it makes my hair very silky and shiny with lots of body ."
1,Fake or extremely old,"I ordered this product from this seller and I got a bottle that was not sealed or packaged at all. The bottle looks worse than the empty one I currently have, the label is chipping off and it looks gross. The product doesn't smell right either, I've used this shine gloss for a long time and ordered it off the internet because it's either not being made anymore, or my local store quit carrying it. Whatever is in this bottle IS NOT JOHN FRIEDA FRIZZ EASE SHINE GLOSS, it smells as if they filled a bottle with robbing alcohol and sent it to me (the real product has a very faint hint that smells almost like strawberries). No wonder they marked the price in half so quickly. DO NOT ORDER THIS, IT IS A SCAM."
1,Tune Out This Book,"Sorry, but if you want to broadcast for more than a few feet, this book is not for you. This book is a collection of low-powered simple circuits, backed with high-powered marketing. The back cover states, ""Now that the FCC has changed the laws governing pirate radio and video stations...."" While there is now a low-power FM service, for which a type-accepted transmitter and license are still required, there have been no ""changes"" governing pirate broadcasting. It's still illegal (and fun). And there is nothing in this book that is going to save you ""thousands of dollars"" over commercial equipment, while giving you the same power and performance. These statements are clearly misleading and get your hopes up (and your wallets out) for something this book is not. It's unfortunate that the author, who is probably capable of doing so, did not write a book to match the promised content."
5,great information!,"This book has tons of information, quite technical, not only for learning how to build, but to become familiar with how electronics involved in RF and broadcasting work, to help with insight into troubleshooting problems. Recommended!"
3,I really have mixed feelings about this book,"On the one hand, the book taks a different turn to other common fantasy novels. The hero is not a good man (he commits rape in the first part of the book) and in the books things just don't turn out the way you expect.It IS interesting, in a strange way but there are too many descriptions and not enough plot.If you're interesting in something different than fairies, wizards with long robes and various short people, this might be for you. Beware, this is not an easy book to read. If you like nice shiny heroes in full plate armor, this book is not for you.Just try to look at the first few pages. They are a good indication of what follows."
3,I bought this based on Amazon reviews,"Amazon reviewers are generally accurate. There is a cult-like following that makes the work of some writers beyond criticism on Amazon and perhaps Donaldson is one-such.This first installment of a grand epic is not my cup of tea. I've read other later Donaldson works and he has grown to become a much better writer since this early installment but I don't know how much I have to read to find the crisper Donaldson. This first installment is not compelling. It's boring and full of basic authorial error in plot, sub-plot and dialogue. 3-stars is a favor."
3,Average,"Had reasonably high expectations for this book after some of the reviews but found it a bit boring, and really struggled with some bits.""i'm a leper"" is a favourite cry of Covenant yet no one in the book at any time asks him to explain exactly what this is (as they don't have Lepers in the Land).People like the Giant and Lord Morham call him their friend in what seems like all sincerety when all he has done is bitch and been in general a completelty unlikable character with no traits that would want to make him your friend.All in all you can find better books that a) have more action if that's what you're after or b) bring characters, places to life much better than this one."
1,"You've got to be kidding! Protagonist, Covenant, is a worm.","I can't believe all the positive reviews on this book/series. I have struggled through Book I and Book II holding onto scant hope that the author would somehow redeem the main character, Thomas Covenant. He is an unlikable, egocentric, cowardly, whiny, sniveling, and I'm afraid, unredeemable worm. Try as I might I can't like him. I don't care if he lives or dies. I can't even feel sorry for him. I've read quite a bit of fantasy, some very good, some not so good but this is really awful. I'm afraid that I would find the author's style to be quite tedious even if I did like the characters. Do yourself a favor and read George RR Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, Tad Williams, almost anyone else, but don't bore yourself with the Unbeliever."
1,One of the Worst series I've ever read!,"This entire series was an enormous disappoint to me! I read every single book in the series - I admit, I was curious to see how things would turn out. I wanted to see the bad-guy get it in the end. The problem is that one of the bad-guys is the ""hero"" of the story, and a more undeserving man I've never known! He's a dispicable man with pretty much no redeeming qualities.Leaving aside that issue, the books themselves are depressing, cynical and down-right unpleasant to read. I've never liked that kind of story, so I admit that if you do, you might enjoy these books. I certainly didn't."
1,The worst fantasy novel ever? maybe.,"This book has the most masochistic following I've ever heard of. Lord Foul's Bane was pure, unadulterated torture to read. It had nothing to offer me. The world is boring , it is filled with boring creatures and characters,but the very worst part is the ""anti-hero"" Thomas Covenant. Don't be mislead by the term anti-hero when it is applied to Covenant. This is not some loosely moraled but otherwise entertaining character, nor is he the hardcore kill em all and take no prisoners hero/villain.He's more the wimpy, whiny, irritating, rape a girl who has designs on you anyway kind of anti-hero. Save yourself from some of the worst reading imaginable, pick up a copy of Game Of Thrones, Dune, Eye Of The World[series],Tolkien etc... Sit back and enjoy."
3,Refreshing hero and themes; but unoriginal story and setting,"Thomas Covenant is an interesting anti-hero. He rufeses to believe in all the wonderful things that are around him. He also doesn't believe in the people. He is bitter and spiteful, yet Donaldson does not over do this. The book also wrestles with interesting themes: nature of reality, cruelity of the world, man's cruelity to others, etc. The themes could have been delved into more deeply but this isn't Philip K. Dick. The major problem with this book is that the world and events around Covenant I've already seen in other fantasies. The feel of ""the Land"" is a bit too Tolkienesque and so are the events in the story (Lord Foul/Sauron, Sauron/Lord Foul). Maybe, I shouldn't have read this after finishing Jeffery Ford's ""Memorandum"", which breaks away from the traditional fantasy world."
3,A mixed bag that could have been great,"These books could have been great. Donaldson starts with an extremely compelling idea and a land which is acceptably deviant from Tolkien's map, but some of the story gets lost in the main character. Covenant is such a complete, pathetic wreck that the complex (and often hopelessly dull) descriptions of his manic psyche frequently turn a good story into a confusing psychological study of a basketcase. That the books succeed at all, despite your personal desire to throttle the central protagonist and the often turgid prose (particularly in the first book) is a true testament to Donaldson's overmastering idea, if not his execution. Ironically, the most pleasant reading in the first three books of Thomas Covanent's trilogy is in the second book when the narrative follows another inflicted, but altogether less neurotic character. Donaldson's books are worth the read (just barely), but seem to fall clearly short of both his intention and his potential."
2,Lord Fouls Bane,"This book is hard work. It uses extra, superfluous,unnecessary words wherever less would have sufficed. At 75% complete I remain uncertain about the purpose of the book"
2,Terrible,"Nothing redeeming about Thomas covenant. An anti-hero should have at least some skill or trait that awakens some sort of admiration, or at least be a character we love to hate (joffery from ice and fire comes to mind). Covenant rapes, whines, and hisses "" I'm a leper, don't touch me! "" all over the Land ( original name there eh?). I trudged through the book hoping Thomas would be killed off by the giant or the ur things. Also lord foul? Dhrool? Ur ""vile""? Mount dhoom? Some original names would have been nice. The last few pages I was skimming entire paragraphs, hoping The Doctor or Ghandalf or someone would show up to save the ending. At least I can understood why TC's wife left so quickly, seeing what an ur-vile he became. The title of the book is pretty lame too. The book uses English, has somewhat understandable phrasing, and has a plot.. That's about all the pros.. Don't waste your time is my verdict, life is too short"
5,A MUST READ FOR FANTASY LOVERS!,"One cannot describe him/herself as a fan of fantasy literature until you have read the entire Thomas Covenant series by Stephen Donaldson. They are gut-wrenching, mesmerizing, absolutely impossible to put down, and unforgettable. I read this series while in high school, and the impact still resonates. One of the all-time classics in fantasy, ranks close second to Tolkien and towers above everything else."
2,Like wading thru cold maple syrup,"I will say that Donaldson's settings and concept were unique at the time of this series's conception. It might even be said that he revitalized an ailing genre with his well thought out epic. But be warned; this novel will leave intellectually spent. Covenant is perhaps the most indecisive, whiny fantasy ""hero"" I've ever read. I find him thorougly dislikable. He's the kind of guy you don't ask ""how ya doing?"" because he'll take an hour telling exactly what's wrong with his life."
1,One of the worst books I've read,"The story is typical fantasy, which is okay, however the main character completely ruins the book. This person is someone I could never root for, identify with, or think heroic. I kept reading, expecting the story to improve or the main character to change somehow. To put it plainly, this guy is a coward and complains throughout the entire 400+ pages of the book. It truly becomes a bore when the story focuses on this man's angry inner condition and jerk attitude. The supporting characters do not have enough depth and the fantasy of the book's world is not interesting enough to keep the book from being a failure."
5,Suprised by the slams,First let me say that I loved all 6 books and read them back to back. I was never bored and whished for more after they ended.They are my favorite fantasy series.Comparing to:- Rift War Saga ( Fiest ) - Liked it- LOTR & Hobbit ( Tolkein)- Liked it- Eye of The World ( Jordan ) - Liked it but series is stillgoing therefore I stopped reading.Most likly will pick up if whenthe series ends.- Wizard's First Rule ( Goodkind ) - Me no likey. Too muchtorture and pain.- Sword of Shanara ( Brooks ) - No go. Maybe others are goodbut I thought the story was alittle weak. [....]
3,Good but not Great,"This first book of Donaldson's Covenant series would've been wonderful were there not so many either obvious hooks for the stereotypical male reader of fantasy or faults in donaldson's memory. He has created some interesting cultures (honestly, I think the Giants and the Bloodguard are the only reason to read this series) but I have always been irked by the fact that the charcter Lena is apparently slender and delicate when everyone of her people/race/tribe are described as these strong, broad shouldered, earthy people-- i know suspension of disbelief and all, but that kept gnawing at the back of my mind as i read this. However, it is a nice light imaginative read, and if you have time on your hands, his race of giants are worth getting to know."
1,Razberries for Books I can't Finish,"Normally, I would not write a review of a book I couldn't finish. But then I thought: don't the people deserve to know if a book is so terrible that it can't be endured to the end? Yes, they do.With painfully wooden dialog, and a ho-hum world, Lord Foul's Bane is a true bore. I get sleepy after reading forty pages of travelogue. I don't care which way the river flows, or what kind of trees grow where. All of it empty filler, and all of it flaunting an unforgivable lack of imagination. There's a Magic Ring, and an Evil Mountain, a Cave Monster named Drool, and a Dark Lord named Foul. Send it all back, please, I don't want any more.I stopped reading somewhere in the middle of the book, when a legion of ferocious demons is stopped from killing the hero by an army of wild rabbits, dogs, and badgers. Hm. Demons vs. rabbits. Who will win? Hmmm.Avoid."
4,"Good book, second time around","Great book that I read in college, and am now enjoying it the 2nd time around just as much as the first time."
1,Awful just truly awful,"Thomas Covenant is a whining, angry and despicable character. A young girl saves his life and he repays her by raping her? And he justifies it all because it is just a ""dream"". But everyone that meets him thinks he is some great hero. Why? he doesn't contribute anything unless absolutely forced to and actually SLEEPS when wounded members of his party need to be taken care of. Avoid this book I don't understand where all the hype and great ratings for this book come from."
3,interesting idea but a bit annoying,"I have just completed this book for the first time, and was drawn in initially by the sad angry Tom Covenant and his Leprosy (I went straight to wiki to find out more about Leprosy and Lepers). But once the switch was made to 'the Land' though making for interesting psychological conundrums (is it really a dream? is it real?) the main character annoyed me and the other characters seemed a bit empty, that said the potential is there with some beautiful writing and world development. I have the next two books in this trilogy and having read a few other reviews saying that things improve i'm hoping for better things. At the moment it's not standing up to the praise I have read about this series but as I said I've only just started on my journey with Tom."
1,Celebrating rape,"Donaldson must have a soul blighted with darkness and self loathing. Many of his characters certainly do. The most vile, odious, and despicable of his characters is the anti-hero Thomas Covenant, a self absorbed, narcissistic leper filled with self loathing. Fairly early in the book Covenant rapes a child. The account is short, but detailed. Only a reprobate would stoop to using the details of rape to propel his career as an author. The main impetus of the book thereafter seems to be for the reader to hate Covenant for an absolutely worthless hero who refuses to do any good to anyone. He has a magical ring of power (how derivative), but he refuses to use it to help save the land. He has to be impelled, for hundreds of pages, by better characters to ever do anything of worth. Whenever Covenant actually accomplishes anything worthy of note, it is inadvertant, or forced without his volition. I kept hoping for a terrible death for Covenant as I read this book and each subsequent book."
1,It's Crap,"This was the first fantasy series I ever read. This was in 10th grade. I read both trilogies. I thought they were amazing. Which shows what a simpleton I was at the time. I read The Lord of the Rings shortly thereafter and realized that Donaldon had lifted much of his story from Tolkien. I have heard it called a ""derivative work"" in relation to Tolkien. It is a derivative work in the sense that generic pharmaceuticals are derivatives of name-brand pharmaceuticals."
1,Not worth the time to read,A good friend practically forced me to read this book. I got through it but I am not happy about it. The protagonist is completely unlikable (he rapes a young woman in the beginning of the book). The author abuses dramatic license by providing a completely inaccurate description of leprosy (in this book an incurable disease). I found myself rolling my eyes while reading the author's horrible use of metaphor. The ending is every bit as dumb as the beginning of the book. The only interesting part of the book is the bloodguard. Don't waste your time on this one.
2,Tedious and Dark,"I felt the characters in this book weren't well developed. The situation Donaldson creates is so dark and depressing, that I could not enjoy it, even if I could get over the belabored descriptions and details. However, I would highly recommend ""The Mirror of her Dreams,"" another Donaldson book, so it's likely I just didn't like the theme of the Thomas Covenant chronicles."
3,A Little Criticism,"For the sake of being fair, I will admit that this novel did have one or two redeeming factors. The setting was interesting, and the theme was intriguing. However, I find Donaldson's writing style to be repetetive, and the further I got in the book, the more it irritated me. Also, no matter which angle I look at it from, I find the main character to be generally unlikable. Perhapse it isn't a flaw of the novel, but I find it very difficult to make it through a novel about a character who utterly repulses me. As a foot-note, I have to add that, to the novel's credit, it wasn't anything at all like Tolkien's books. If you're considering purchasing this book, I'll just say that you'd better be able to sympathize with an immoral coward."
5,Unforgettable,"I am not a great reader of the fantasy genre, becuase I find most of it to be poorly written, and/or juvenile in its content and execution. I read both of the Thomas Covenant trilogies 15 years ago - they still haunt me, even though I have not re-read either series since (though I probably will, now). Reading these books provided some of the most intense emotional responses I have ever had from any book, regardless of genre; when compared to other fantasy, they are is head and shoulders above the rest.If you are one of the (seemingly) many people who believe all books (and plays and movies) should be ""upbeat"" and not ""depressing"", skip these books - stick to Piers Anthony. If you like your reading to be an emotional experience, I highly recommend all six books in both trilogies."
2,Hmmm....Adult fiction?,"While I believe that the characters could be real in the work, such as having flaws and such, the plot line is sorely in need of originality. I'm sick of fantasy novels in which the main hero is suddenly whisked away from his normal life in to some imaginary dreamworld. If the book started there it would be fine, but too many fantasy novels try to cause plotlines by impossible events like just moving around characters through time and space unknowingly. The reason for the second star is because at the end Covenant questions whether or not the dream was real or fake..."
5,Lord Foul's Bane is great .. this printing .. is not.,"I loved this book. I can't see why I waited so long to read this series. My only gripe is that the printing on the inside is the same font size as the mass market paperback. They wasted 1 inch of paper all the way around the text. Save yourself $18.00 and buy the mass market paperback.I gave five stars to the story, not the format."
3,Finially! An Adult Fantasy,"If you've been longing for a mature, adult fantasy series, Donaldson delivers. Lord Foul's Bane is the first of two (and going on three?) triologies which breaks the mold which contiues to plague fantasy today--they all seem to be written for 15 year old boys.if you can get past Donaldfson's irritatingly complex style (and a boring first 40 pages), you are in for a treat. More than any other modern fantasy, Donaldson challenges his readers, brings them into a vivid world which pointedly asks some very tough questions. And all the while with adventures, battles, and magic.Each book of the series gets better. The story starts slow, but the suspense and action build whith each book. By the end, I was devouring dozens of pages at a time."
5,The book with unmatched worth,I cant describe what thous Chronicles meant to me. It is an ungrateful job to be critic or the judge... anyway First and the Second Cronichles of Thomas Covenant are full of knowledge about anything that has the roots in divine pure. Stephen R. Donaldson in the man with without a match. J R Tolkin is good but it cant be even close to Mr. Donaldson. His even stronger than Dostojevski (in serbian writtings).
3,Worth reading,"Donaldson's style of writing is a bit dramatic for me. Some nonessential events were described in overly flamboyant style.The plot was one dimensional, predictable, and even boring at times. Many of the characters were not developed enough.There are two aspects of Lord Foul's Bane that make it worth reading. Thomas Covenant is not your typical hero. In my opinion, he is more like my jerk neighbor. I suppose much of Covenant's bad attitude can be explained away by his struggles as a leper (I don't know what my neighbors excuse is)- but regardless of that, is was refreshing to see a protagonist who wasn't the legendary, squeaky clean, knight in shining armor. Also, the setting created by Donaldson for this quest is enjoyable despite the frequently overly dramatic descriptions."
5,An epic masterpiece of fantasy.,"Donaldson spins a tale that no one else could. A story that contains all the aspects of great fantasy, but whose main character believes in none of those aspects. This is one of the greatest works I have ever read. Donaldson's flawless portrayal of an utterly tortured soul (Thomas Covenant) is truly awe-inspiring to any experienced reader."
5,Complex Fantasy for the Discerning Reader,"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant are an intensely satisfying experience for the more cerebral reader. There are actually two series based on the adventures of this modern day leper that, combined, explore in great detail the human suffering and anguish felt by an outcast in one society who becomes a hero in another. Thomas Covenant's primary dilemma seems to be in distinguishing reality from fantasy. In contrast to the great Don Quixote, Thomas Covenant refuses to believe in his fantastic adventures. Are they real or are they delusions induced by a series of tragic accidents? It's up to you to decide!"
1,A Reader's Bane,"Like the others who gave this book one star, I agree that it is poorly written. The simplistic compound names lack imagination. The book seems a near rip-off of Tolkien's works. Maybe this series is meant for teens or younger, but so is Harry Potter and those books were great reading (although nothing new there, either.) Check it out at the library before buying the first book. I couldn't get through half of it."
5,The Greatest Fantasy I have ever encountered,"When one wants to engulf themselves in a fantasy novel, they want to be taken on a ride that hails major emotions. Love always garners hate, redemption, fear, anticipation, and numerous other emotions. All caused by one premise ""love"". Love is the precursor, fuel for the flame but only one in a fantasy world the sky is the limit and Steven R. Donaldson delivers with astounding story telling. I have read the first and Second Chronicles three times over. I had just learned recently that a third Chronicle existed. I have completed all except ""The Last Dark"", which will not be available until sometime in the Fall of 2013.Please read all of the First, Second and Third Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. You will be extremely pleased, I was and still am when I re-read them.M.L. Taylor"
2,Seems pretty cliche..,I'm sure back when this one came out it was fun but these days it seems a bit old-school and cliche.
2,Didn't Like it,"Tried this book on a recommendation from my brother. Found it really stupid and kind of arrogant in the use of language, like he was trying too hard to impress you with obscure words (and I like to think I have a pretty good vocabulary). Kind of like he swallowed a thesaurus and borrowed other peoples stories besides. Read the whole thing, but have no desire to read any more of the series. Main character too angry and couldn't seem to get over it. Wore me out."
4,Why?,"Why the hell did the ""hero"" rape that girl. It doesn't jive with my idea of a heroic thing to do. I thought that aside from the rape, the book was well written and it was an interesting story. I would reccomend this book."
2,Thomas Covenant the Unbelievable,"To their fans, works of such perrennial popularity become impervious to critism, but if you're a careful reader and demand (as do fans of Hard SF, for example) a fairly high standard of verisimilitude and common-sense in a character's behavior, you may find The Chronicles too vulnerable to logic to be entirely successful. On a lesser note, I was continually reminded that Donaldson's indebtedness to Tolkien is too significant to go unacknowledged by the author. Those who seek the dark, introspective Fantasy departure that this book strives to be would be more challenged by Mervyn Peake's brilliant, underappreciated (in the U.S.) Gormenghast novels."
1,A Very Bad Book; A Very Bad Trilogy,"This guy cannot write worth a darn! He makes stuff up that is not realistic! Thomas Covenant is a major league jerk! I could write a better book than this, no problem. I will not tell anyone to read this book because it is so bad!!!"
2,Warning: The protagonist is a rapist,"Seriously, the protagonist rapes a woman almost as soon as he gets to fantasy land and can feel pleasure in his nerve endings. If that squicks you out, avoid the book. Otherwise the book then deals with the consequences of that rape, as do books following. This series is designed to counter all the fantasy tropes, including the idea that the hero has to be good."
1,Read Donaldson or drill a hole in my head? Tough choice.,"This was agony to read. Really, this was one of the worst books I have ever picked up. The sentences sit on the page like dog poo on your lawn. It is the most forced and laboured prose I've ever experienced.The idea is fine, and in the hands of a competent writer would have made a decent book. But in the hands of Donaldson it is painful. It creates as much interest as reading company tax legislation.Avoid at all costs."
2,great writing - not so great character,"I really enjoyed the writing of this book, but the maid character, Thomas, really let me down. he was the sort of person who always throught the world was against him and would not believe what life threw in his path. i put this book down after a hundred pages, to ""hopefully read later.""But if you are looking for a book where the writing is great and draws you in from page one, then this is a book you'd enjoy. but if you like likable characters and does not go into unnessary discripions, then i would not recomend this book to you.hope this is of use to some one."
4,What a jerk,"Since I can't wait to read the next installment of the Thomas Covenant Series, it's pretty obvious that I liked them. And for good reason. Donaldson paints pictures with words as well as anyone I've ever read. The stories have a great plot, and the characters are fully developed.So why did he have to make Covenant such a complete a@#hole? Time and time again, I thought that his rudeness detracted from the story. If you want a great start to a fantasy series, buy this book. But avoid it if you are expecting a story with a perfect protagonist that aids everyone."
1,"A 10,000 word essay on trees and bushes","A painfully boring read. The hero is a jerk, the writing is terrible and the story goes on and on and on. Don't waste your time"
1,A rapist can't be a hero.,"I only made it half way through this book. Early in the book the hero rapes a girl. I pushed on trying to be interested in what happened. Without the rape it may have been worth reading, however there is no way you can make a rapist into a hero. Half way through I gave up."
1,I'm warnin' ya,I read the first 5 books in this series when it initially came out. I couldn't even finish the Second series it was so bad. I was once a big reader of Fiction and read the Lord of the Rings and Dune when I was 10 years old; I've read LOTR 15 times since. This Series is singularly responsible for turning me into a reader of strictly Non-Fiction Biography/History/Political Science for the last 30 years.
3,"in one word ""Cliché""","This book is not interesting and I fear that I will not be able to finish it. I find the plot to be cliché in the extreme. When I read fantasy usually there are moments when I jump up and whisper to myself ""whoo"". This is not one of those books, need I say more.Maybe I am a stupid person with a limited vocabulary. I do not enjoy being humbled by an author's vocabulary unless they lived hundreds of years before my time. Mr. Doaldson, please ""dumb down"" your vocabulary because aside from using the context clues I had my dictionary out on almost evey page.The writing is good but there isn't enough creativity to fuel my imagination. I will move on to other writers."
1,One of the worst book that I have tried to read,"I am not a great reader. I have read maybe 30 books in the last 3 years, maybe more. My brother told me about this book and I went to the public library and checked out ""Lord Foul's Bane"". He had lots of praise for the book and was sure I would enjoy it. He was wrong, wrong, just wrong. It seems to be ""A.D.D."" in print. It jumps around and around, and rambles on and on. I loved Terry Goodkind's ""The Sword of Truth Series"", I enjoyed Weis & Hickman and all that they have written but Donaldson is killing me. I will finish this book but I will not read any more of Donaldson. I guess it takes all kinds for the world to go around. I will take a pass here."
2,what is there to like?,"I did not enjoy this book one bit. I read fantasy because I enjoy heroes. I enjoy reading about other worlds. I want likeable characters and a plot that moves along. I want to be happy.I just could not get myself into the character of Thomas. He is angry and bitter. He RAPES a young girl. Why am I going to cheer for this character? Why am I going to care what happens to him? I spent the majority of the book hoping he would get killed.I gave the book two stars because I in some ways appreciate the fact that this is an original work. The main character is highly flawed and has leprosy. The world building is done well. The writing style is very good.If you like dark fantasy, or do not mind a flawed hero, then by all means try this book. I personally did not like it at all."
3,"Hey, I remember you!","I saw Stephen R. Donaldson's name on one of these web pages, and had a Thomas Covenant flashback. I read them almost twenty years ago. I also have met others and in talking about books mentioned reading about ol' Tommy. The consensus has always been- loved the stories, HATED Covenant. He is the single most whiny, woe is me, everyone is picking on me man in literary history. I often found myself hoping something would eat him, or his fingers would grow back, and his tongue would fall out. Oh, my god,this review thing is better than a shrink! All this pent up anger towards that guy who would see someone get cut in half,or argue with some giant ogre, then say ""Nope, I don't believe it."" I feel wonderful. Thank you, ..., I might even try reading another of Robert Jordan's five-pounders. Well, maybe not."
2,About a hundred pages in and I think time may be better spent...,"Purchased this book on a recommendation. I'm about a hundred pages into it and realized that I was not attached to the ""hero"" figure whatsoever. Let me rephrase that, I could actually care less about the hero figure at this point. The story has yet to captivate me and realizing there are 2 more books after this I believe I should quit while I am ahead. No need in spending any more time or money reading about a whining hero who may or may not have powers from an old divorce. I'll give it two stars because It has resale value at the half priced bookstore down the street."
2,It's been a while.,"It's been a long time since I attempted to read this series. Convoluted, overdramatic, derivative. It's got some great descriptions in it; I still remember loving the Land just from the way it was described. But. 1) High Fantasy really has to work hard not to re-visit every bit of Tolkien. This one didn't start out different enough not to suffer by comparison. 2) The main protagonist is both annoying and loathesome. Theoretically, I know the books are about his redemption. In actuality, I can't care. We're never given enough reason to care. He never seems to have the potential to be *smart*, never mind heroic, or even humane. Even trying to read it again, going in with the knowledge that no, he's not all that admirable? He doesn't come across as interesting. 3) Slow book is slow.If you like it, more power to you. You've got more patience and detachment than I do."
5,Best fantasy series since Tolkein,"This book is a great start to a great series. Donaldson creates a fascinating alternative world, where his main character, Thomas Covenant is summoned. Covenant suffers from leprosy, which turns him into a reluctant hero. He's hard to like, but easy to understand. By the end of the book, you'll be right with him.Thge plot centers around Covenant's white gold wedding band. White gold holds some key to power in Donaldson's world, only no one seems to know how to use it, except maybe Lord Foul, the incarnation of evil and the main antagonist throughout the series.The story take s a bit of time to develop, but stick with it. It's the first of a trilogy so give Donaldson the time he needs to set up his world. It's well worth it."
5,Poster,this poster looks great on my dorm room wall. It arrived promptly and in great packaging. It easily unrolled and stayed that way. I can tell it was stored flat and was not always in a circular container. I would recommend this
3,Not the ultimate Romeo collection by far,"I love Max Romeo but this isn't the best collection of his work. Sure there are a few classic tunes here that are wicked songs. But they miss out on a lot of other great track at the expense of some really obscure Romeo songs. Anyhow, that's why I got this CD - for the rare tracks, as I have all the others. But this CD doesn't even have We Dream - a rude boy classic that chugs along on a wicked rhythm.So I hate to give Max a three stars - but there are much better comps out there. Get a collection of his early years ""Pray For Me"" or get the scortching ""Open the Iron Gate""."
2,"Writing is boring for kids, pictures are great","My 2 year old enjoys the pictures in this book, but the ""story"" is poorly written and does nothing to capture the attention of a toddler. I usually just read the first 2 lines on each page and then make up something else -- like ""What sound does a dog make?"" Or ""What color is the ladybug?"". My son has definite favorite books, and this is not one of them."
4,Einstein touch & feel neighborhood animals,"My grandson LOVES the Einstein videos. I purchased the books that matched the videos I have. I would like to have known how few touch & feel animals there are.They didn't hold his attention as much as I expected. He liked the fuzzie ones best, but wasn't impressed with the flat ones. I bought all the books that looked like they were part of the 2 videos and this review is the same for all of them. I think the books are very well done, just not as many touch & feel as I would like."
1,National Geographic should be ashamed.,"This slap dash compilation of short descriptions was probably put together as a quick way to make a few bucks. The authors are indeed esteemed but I bet each one wrote their part from memory on a Sunday afternoon. The battle descriptions are dry and confusing--most of the maps are useless in determining the sequence of events. Geography seems to be sort of thrown in as a catchy way to snare amateur buffs like myself. I usually read reviews before I buy a book and this time I just ""assumed"" good quality due to the National Geographic Society imprimatur. Stay away!"
5,onion juice,I could no longer find this in the grocery store and needed it for a salad dressing I make. Now I probably have a lifetime supply!! good service and good price
5,A great addition to any cupboard,"I adore this stuff. It enhances every recipe that calls for onions. I use it in home made salad dressings, pasta sauces, tuna, shrimp and crab salads, soups and stews. My family likes onions, so there is little that makes it to our table without a few splashes of Howard's onion juice in it."
3,Forgotten Fleet Forgotten,"I was stationed at the Norfolk Group Atlantic Reserve Fleet in 1960-1961 and purchased this book to see what it had to say about a little known part of the Navy. The book did not mention the NORVAGRULANTRESFLT at all, while spending considerable time with pictures and stories of the West Coast locations. Overall a rehash of stories of the ships placed into and taken out of mothballs rather than about the operations and day to day routines of the Fleets themselves. I was not impressed with the book at all."
1,"Kit Bonner, Naval Historian & Author","Very poorly researched and appears to have been prepared through the primary use of the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships and photos from the National Archives. It comes through that the author is unfamiliar with the subject matter, and I am surprised and dismayed the the Naval Institute Press released something of this quality. Many other members agree. There is an old adage about writing - stick with what you know. Madsen tried, but the book doesn't make the grade.K H Bonner"
1,off target,"This book is not about the so-called mothball fleets per se. Instead it is a somewhat morose homage to selected US naval vessels from World War Two that seems to imply something better should have happened to each of them.There is virtually no explanation of why these vessels were collected, how the process was carried out and what were the outcomes. There are a few - very few - good pictures showing the various ship collections from its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. Overall, one is left with the impression that the book is the output of a google/wikipedia search."
4,Information Galore,"""Teaching the Short Story, A Guide to Using Stories from Around the World,"" is a great book with a lot of useful information,however, it could be organized a little better. The book begins with an introduction that explains the benefit of using short stories to illustrate universal themes. After, the reader is led to the annotations that are alphabetized by the author's last name from countries around the world. Because many teachers who teach English are not familiar with these authors it would seem beneficial to have the annotations organized by country, and then within each of these sections, alphabetize by name. The Best part of the book by far is the index. The back of the book has an index for the titles of short stories from around the world, suggested comparison-themes and a cross-reference guide for stories taught in English. If you take the time to carefully look through this book you will realize that you've found a treasure."
4,I waited a long time for this,"I walked into a record store on the K Street Mall in Sacramento CA in 1975 and heard this playing - the LP. The song was ""Rock and Roll Lullabye"" and I didn't have any money in my pocket or I would have bought it. I looked for it for 20 years, no exaggeration, until I found the CD in Lansing MI. I bought it and the song was as good as I'd remembered, and the rest of the disc was wonderful - the last track being the most entertaining. If you enjoy collecting music by pre-Beatles pop and rock artists, you won't regret this addition to your library."
3,Igginbottom's Wrench,"As an Allan Holdsworth fan, I was naturally eager to get my hands on this album especially for the fact that it is early Holdsworth as I also have an interest in the technical developement of his musical style. The music on this album may be a bit difficult to listen to for some fans of Holdsworth recent material but it's a must have for both serious collectors and Holdsworth fans. Take for instance the fact that Allan is the principle lead singer in the group. His voice is a natural and refreshing pure tone expression of his original musical thoughts and his pitch is quite good. The hardest thing for me to like on the record is the stark meatless tone of the guitars. They sound almost as if they were plugged directly into a characterless mixing console with no effects or helpful EQ. Despite this, the playing is extraordinary, with enough momentary gems to warrent the purchase of this piece of history."
1,Poor grammar and editing,The humor in this book is somewhat sophomoric but more distracting are the numerous grammatical and stylistic errors that detract from seamless reading. The characters are overinflated and artificial to the point of being irritating.
4,I loved it!,"The dean of my college gave me a copy of this book because he thought I could relate to the problems TAs have, as narrated so expertly in this masterpiece. I could, and I loved this book! Anyone who wants to read a highly intellectual account of what is going wrong in our nation's English departments should read a boring (and they all are) and useless dissertation. This book is meant for those who want some lighthearted reading and the chance to live out their imaginations through the actions of Mr. Meade. The Meade solution may well be the best laugh you'll get out of school-related material for a long, long while. Enjoy!"
3,Ok at best,"I would say that the CD is somewhat good but not more than that. In fact, some of the songs like the title track, River of Love, Through These Eyes and one or two more are great but the rest are easy to forget. After listening to this CD a coule of times I got the feeling that by track 6 it gets kind of ordinary. Here's why. First 4 songs are easy to listen to as they are fresh and interesting. After that it gets slower and sort of the same. Up to track 9 there are no surprises so you get through them without even noticing much difference. No Bed of Roses (9) is better, after that comes a good power ballad (10) and two other songs that you feel you've heard before.Don't get me wrong, I like George Lynch's playing and he is there all the time (almost). So no complaints about that. Maybe it's the sequence of the songs, i don't know. But there's something missing to call this a truly great CD."
4,A good follow-up,"A good follow-up to their debut album. If you mix the two albums together and play all the songs, you won't hear any difference."
4,Highly Underrated,"I bought this cd when it came out and could not stop listening to it. I was a huge Dokken fan at the time and could not get enough of any association with the band. Wicked Sensation stayed in my car's cd/cassette player for months. It's great fun and a must have for any Dokken fan, in my opinion. If you're still a fan of the genre, check out Lynch/Pilson's Wicked Underground cd as this would be a great addition to your collection."
3,Wicked Sensation is Definitely Worthwhile,"Having been a big Dokken fan, it was nice to hear some great work from George Lynch with Dokken drummer, Mick Brown and bassist Anthony Esposito. Different from Don Dokken, but really good on the vocals is Oni Logan. The whole CD is pretty good but the best of the album is the first six songs.Wicked Sensation, River of Love, Sweet Sister Mercy all rock and there's a nice, ""bad"" groove through All I Want, Hell Child and She's Evil But She's Mine. No Bed of Roses is also decent and the rest of the songs are fair.Note that this album is pretty good but having bought their 1992 self-titled release with new vocalist, Robert Mason, there are only about three of the songs that are good. Their first album is the one to get."
3,An Average Album.,"I bought this album around the same time that I bought Up from the Ashes from Don Dokken about nine years ago. I enjoyed Up from the Ashes more than this album really. There are some average songs on this release, but listening to this album even now, there's just nothing groundbreaking about Wicked Sensation. The leadsinger sounds a bit like the Aerosmith singer in places. George Lynch plays the guitar well, but the direction of this album wasn't quite in the Dokken direction; Wicked Sensation is much grittier. Average album, but nothing really stands out or is memorable."
4,Not Bad,"Yeah, this is an improved form of hair metal. All the clichés are there, yet despite all, I found myself enjoying it.The singer keeps his pitch midrange which I really appreciate. None of that high-pitched wailing or screeching so common for this genre. There are the typical sing-along choruses and George's shredding is what really stands out. However, as much as I like Mick Brown as a drummer, he still carries that irritating ""hair metal"" snare drum sound.I think if that snare sound had been altered a notch or two, this music might have come off as a bit heavier than it actually sounded.I found the music decent, but also found myself drifting away. I was a captive audience in the car, but still found plenty of time to daydream.Overall, though, I would have liked to see them live as I think they could have put on a decent show. If you are a hair metal fan, or just like to hear some good but not overdone shredding, check it out. Recommended."
3,Likeable and energetic.,"I remember getting Wicked Sensation many years ago when it was first released. This is a pretty good debut album from Lynch Mob. It's a little more rougher-sounding than what guitarist George Lynch did with Dokken. There's a total of twelve tracks included on the disc. All of them are listenable tunes. George Lynch certainly doesn't disappoint when it comes to his guitar skills. There are some nice guitar riffs and solos throughout. Oni Logan does an efficient job with the vocals, also. Mick Brown (from Dokken) handles the drums. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are satisfying and tight. Wicked Sensation is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. Some of the songs that I like are ""Sweet Sister Mercy,"" ""She's Evil But She's Mine,"" and ""Through These Eyes."" ""She's Evil But She's Mine"" and ""Through These Eyes"" both sport nice and catchy choruses. Wicked Sensation is pretty cool. Worth a listen."
4,Wicked Sensation: Wicked Hard Rock/Metal,"Lynch Mob's first album, Wicked Sensation, is simply this: Blistering, aggressive heavy rock. I don't like every song here but if you want sleazy, in-your-face, kick-butt & take-no-prisoners hard rock/metal, I think you'll like Wicked Sensation.""Wicked Sensation"" is probably the best tune here, it's heavy and powerful with a nasty riff. Comparable to Dokken at their heaviest. ""River Of Love"" is excellent and rolls like thunder, George Lynch is totally rocks on guitar here. ""No Bed Of Roses"" is another highlight with it's crunchy guitar work. ""Through These Eyes"", though ballad-like, is a very strong song with nice vocal melodies.This CD will appeal to fans of Dokken as well as sleaze metal bands such as Ratt, Motley Crue and Guns 'n' Roses. If you're a fan of guitarist George Lynch, this is a must have CD."
5,George Lynch Wicked Sensation CD,Just as great as I remember. It was a replacement as my original got lost. Great service from Amazon.
5,A GREAT ROCK N ROLL ALBUM,I have know Oni since '87. I watched him progress from South Florida local clubs to this insane sounding album. The Lynch albums after Wicked Sensation are sub par in comparison. This Cd is a must for music fans who really loved the best of what great rock guitar albums can offer.Danny Quick
4,george lynch rocks on his own !,"if your expecting this album to sound like dokken- no chance. this album is heavier and in more of a different direction. its good though i really like it. lots of the times you cant tell if its george cuz he sounds like any 80's metal guitrist in dokken you could easily know its him. theres some good songs here- ""sweet sister mercy"",""all i want"", ballads- ""through these eyes"" milloin miles"" singer oni logan sings awesome he adds some different vocal techniques not often heard and the background choruses are really good different than dokken's all in all if ya love pure rock n roll this album will serve its purpose"
5,Cheaper then the dealership,Needed a new ignition coil and didn't want to pay dealership prices. This is a fraction of the cost and did the trick. The quality was on par with most aftermarket parts. Doesn't look quite as good as OEM but has the essentials to work. Fitment was fine and the car now runs well. Good buy for the price.
4,More than just Woolf being cute,"FLUSH probably gets the least respect of all of Virginia Woolf's books, and many critics at the time of its publication in 1933 (and since) thought she was being more than a bit twee in telling the satory of the Elizabeth Barrett-Robert Browning courtship from the point of view of Barrett's adored cocker spaniel. But this experiment in biography is much more than that: it's an attempt to understand the world from a non-human point of view, and it also is Woolf's most overt look in her fiction at class difference and (more unusually) at the world of crime. It's also a terrific addition to Woolf's extended engagement from an early 20th-c. perspective with the world of genteel Victorian society and its snobberies and hypocrisies."
4,"""You see this dog..."" elizabeth barrett browning","I bought and read Flush with some scepticism. While I can't praise Virginia Woolf enough, I tend to shy away from animal stories. Flush, however, is the exception to the rule. My scepticism soon dissipated and I was thrown into a world more human than most written worlds. Flush is among the most sympathetic and beautiful character sketches I have ever come across. This is a very different book for Woolf and I couldn't be more glad that she took the chance to write something that seems so trivial. There is feeling of release in the way it is written, but it is not flippant. Rather, it makes the character of Flush that much more accessible to the reader."
2,Yet another release,"I like this series even though it tends to be a bit simple and low budget. Most previous and current DVD releases are all under the title ""The Veil"" and for some reason? they have retitled it which muddies the waters on what it is. It sounds like this release may have a slight amount of additional material but I am not sure. Just type in the search box - ""The Veil"" and you will see the other releases of the smae material. - Steve"
4,very good waist pack,"I use this for short to medium hikes, and it is very good. I drink a lot of water here in hot So Cal, so the fact that it has two water bottles and holders is great. The bottles are easy to reach, remove, and insert while wearing the waist pack. The pack itself is small but you can squeeze in a lot, and it can be unzipped and zipped easily while you are wearing it. Now, FINDING the item you want is up to you!I did find that the belt tended to slip down as I walked and sweated - but I think that is more a result of my geometry (somewhat big belly, and no butt) than of the waist pack. I bought some broad suspenders to hold it up and it works great. I felt a little silly wearing this get-up the first time, but it is very comfortable.One last point - the supplied water bottles have no pop-up ""sport"" top - you have to unscrew the whole cover. I have ordered some polypropylene bottles (the best plastic to use, apparently) to replace them."
3,High Sierra Talus Waistpack,The High Sierra Talus Waistpack looks larger in the picture than it actually is. I was dissapointed in the storage capacity of the zipper pouch. It was VERY handy for carrying water around [I used it at Disney]; but my wallet and phone would not fit together in the pouch when the water bottles were inserted. Recommend you make this storage 2x the current and then you would get 5 stars out of me. That's if you send me another one at no additional charge!
2,Cup holders are not removable,I like this bag but the product info said the drink holders could be removed which is not the case. The drink containers (the plastic bottles) can be removed but not the holders. If ou don't carry water it looks a bit odd with the holders sticking out of the pack.
1,Who is she kidding?,"Please! As if we the TV audience could not see where real arrogance and hypocrisy lie and on whom! We can spot real compassion and humility from a mile apart, and these qualities are nonexistent in this Tv host! She is nothing but arrogant, inhuman and insensitive with her audience! Please!"
4,"good price, good ball","great price for an average basketball. loosing some of its grip now after a few months of driveway play, but I am satisfied."
1,Hard as a brick,"I ordered the ""perfection"" and received the ""crossover"" which I assume is of equal quality. The ball is very hard and plastic feeling (like it spent to much time in the sun and got baked). Really, this ball is a rock!Just to be clear, I did NOT try to return this ball (come on , its a $15 ball...)It might be OK for the elementary school playground I guess, but I'm disappointed that Baden would market a ball that is this inferior.Save your money and buy a ball that you can see and feel from your local retailer."
3,not sure I got what I ordered,"the ball I got says crossover, not perfection. decent ball, as you would expect, it gets slick after a few times. but it holds air, I don't mind it for shooting around. it feels a little heavy."
2,Difficult to follow,"I found the instructions in this book difficult to follow. Much of the time the author refers to products I have never heard of, and the way the directions are presented is confusing. I do get a lot of inspiration from the pictures, though, so use it to try new ideas. It is easier to try to figure out what to do from the pictures than it is from reading the directions."
2,Wrong Book,I was sent the wrong book. Then he claimed he sent the right one that I never recieved. He refunded my money but I am frustrated!
1,Hymns to holocaust,"Bragg has always been abysmal as a singer/songwriter, but recording the anthem of a political movement that killed millions around the globe is in bad taste--even for pop music. Crank it up, comrades, and blast back to the era of the gulags, that era you love so well."
1,Garbage,"I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive. Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room. The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing. It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand. The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live. This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash. I won't miss it at all."
3,"Good, But....","I was very happy with this clock radio - the sound is great, the options for pre-sets are wonderful. However, if the power goes out, you loose EVERYTHING - the time, the radio presets and the alarms you've programmed. This is rather annoying & time consuming (as it's a bit complicated to reset these things) and there is no battery back up."
2,Big Sound - Blinding Display,"The CD sound from this compact unit is virtually unmatched. CD's sound magnificant. Unfortunately, the backlit display was bright enough to warn overhead air traffic to stay clear of my bedroom. The display is transparent and, as a reuslt, its light shines through the front and the back of the unit. Even on the lowest setting my bedroom was significantly illuminated. Sony should have included a hood to put over the unit at night, or perhaps a black-out mask for your eyes. If you intend to use this in your bedroom, forget it. Otherwise, it would make a great appliance for another room in your house."
3,"GREAT SOUND, DIFFICULT TO USE","Sound is bright and crisp. Pulls in weak FM signals and by using mono switch the sound becomes much cleaner. Problems are numerous: Cannot easily read the display, have to turn on room light to make adjustments, too easy to hit wrong buttons, has no batter back-up, the constant back light is a bit disturbing. I am really disappointed and am about to return it for refund."
3,Like sleeping by the moon,"Seriously. This is a great alarm clock. It has great features and is clearly well thought through. I absolutely loved the features. It is very, very easy to use. HOWEVER, the lowest setting for the LCD display is very bright. We had to put a towel over the clock so that we could sleep at night. It glows a pretty white/blue that is very much like sleeping under a full moon. We returned the item. I have not found a system I like better, but the brightness is a killer."
3,Attractive But Too Many Exposed Parts,"While the Sony CD855VSIL looks futuristic, don't be fooled. Its parts stick out and easily break. Worse, in six months the CD started skipping. My brother's daughters knocked the radio three feet to the floor and it broke all over the place. If you want a high quality clock radio, get a Tivoli Model One and use an audio cable to connect it to a Kaito 1103 radio. Turn the Tivoli to auxiliary mode and use its speaker while you use the Kaito's receiver. You won't get stronger FM reception. As far as CD clock radio goes, I'd go with the Panasonic RC-CD350, which has a better build quality and is thirty dollars cheaper."
2,Sleek and good sound only,I purchased and returned this item the next day.It has a huge power supply (see other reviews). This probably has a non battery backup within. You will need to think of where you want this to go or get an extension cord.I am near sighted and I could not read the time at night without putting on my glasses.A remote would be nice at this price.
2,"No dream, this machine","Do not buy this unless you're looking for a light you can read by at night. As other reviewers have said, even at the dimmest setting, the light from the clock radio is so bright, your neighbors may ask you to turn it down. The sound is excellent, but ergonomically, the controls are small and poorly laid out, which is surprising, since Sony's old Dream Machine was really well thought out. Finally, after less than a year, the CD player has nearly given up the ghost, skipping the first couple of tracks on all CDs."
2,Everything but ...,"The Sony CD clock radio almost has everything I was looking for. A CD player. Easy use of both alarms. The ability to set both alarms to the radio (this sounds simple, but many CD clock radios (Timex, Panasonic) allow a sound source to be associated with only one of the alarms). Good sound. Very good looks. But unlike most clock radios, it does not have a battery backup. As my area periodically gets short blackouts, this is needed. Especially since getting to work depends upon it. If you do not need the backup, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,need to be out of stock,"This radio is truly a piece of junk.Unlike others my radio light went out.Couldn't find any where I could buy a replacement light.And as far as that is concern,I couldn't even find out how to remove the light. The sound is so-so and the unit itself is too bulky. It takes up a lot of space on the night stand.The only positive thing I can about this product is it has a jack for hear phones."
2,sucks!,Bought new around $80. CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!!
3,Those with poor eyesight should avoid!,"This clock radio has many good features (digital tuning, many presets, lots of alarm options.) HOWEVER, the backlight lights up the room at night (need to cover the back to avoid this) and the low contrast display is difficult to read at night if you are very nearsighted, as is my wife. Unless you sleep with your glasses on, not a good display choice!"
3,Split Review,"The sound quality of this unit is great for the size - it fills up our bedroom with good quality sound from CD's or the radio. It looks cool - clock radios usually look like clock radios - too bad for them - no worries on style with this unit.The lighthing on this unit is way too bright - I almost want to throw a cover over it at night - then to top it off its bright, but you cannot read what time it is because the LCD number display is dime.It works, looks cool, but needs to be updated. JVD"
3,Next day shipping is not worth it...,"The garter was really cute & my sister loved it. Unfortunately, I paid for the next day shipping, which cost more than the garter did, and it didn't come in until the end of the third day... After her wedding! Luckily we were able to find another one for her to toss & she was able to keep this one..."
4,Celtic experience,"This deck was my first experience of the Celtic mythology, and I keep coming back to it. It's attention to detail and pictures blend to make it a very interesting and informative way to approach Celtic lifeview, besides making it a good deck to read with. I expecially like the pictures of sites sacred to this ancient religion scattered throughout. A nice find."
5,This is a great deck!!!,"Alright, the Celtic symbolism is annoying at first, but it's still one of the best decks I have. I'm attracted to the pictures because they came out of the computer, and the colors are so cool and really jump out at you. I use it all the time, and I've made it my ""people"" deck because the readings are so accurate.BUY IT!!!"
3,"Beautiful for collecting, but not for intensive use.","When I first recieved this tarot I was ever so happy. It was colorful and realistic with its pictures. Though when I began to use them, problems would emerge. The cards are quite large, in that I couldn't comfortably suffle them. When trying to interpret the meanings, there would be fairly long definitions in a book included. Which made the spread incrediably long to read, especially for others I tried to read for. Also like another reviewer here, I find it hard to concentrate on the reading when I know which card is reversed beforehand. So if you enjoy collecting cards rather than using them intensively I suggest this deck."
4,Expierenced Tarot Reader Gives 4 Stars!,"I love this tarot deck.. since I own hundreds I cannot possibly say that this deck is the best I have ever used, but I will say that it is wonderful, although this may be alittle too spiritual for some. The book is wonderfully detailed and the cards are beautiful.. I use this deck from time to time (along with the Faery Wicca Tarot), when someone is wanting spiritual guidence. When I am teaching I use this along with The Celtic Dragon Tarot.. This is alright for beginers but smaller tarot's are better in my opnion. Over all, this is a worthy buy."
4,Excellent Deck,"I have been using this deck for a year and a half now. The only obstacle I can see with using this deck is the backs of the cards showing whether it will be reversed or not. (Some people have had a slight problem with the size of the cards-but you get used to it in no time.) I just make it a point to not look at them when I am mixing them up so that it will not affect me. Otherwise, the imagery is beautiful-I love the way it has incorporated actual places with the images of the Tarot. Even though some of the meanings and cards are different, it's all in the way you feel when you see them more than what the book says anyway. Great book with lots of information and history. I love it!"
1,I beg to differ,"Most of the reviews on this product are very positive, but I must strongly disagree. I am not afraid to say that this is the only Deck I have discarded. I do not think the artwork is particularly well done at all; the deck was not as useable as others, though the text was slightly insightful. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Nice Deck But Duplicate Cards and Many Cards Missing,"This deck was NOT for me, it was a Christmas gift. It was fully SEALED both outer and inner packaging. Imagine the disappointment when I watched it being opened, the user/gift recipients delight at such a deck, then about an hour later when fully examining it, finding that many of the cards appeared again further down into the deck AND many cards completely missing. I hate that 99% of everything we buy today says ""Made in China"". This said ""Made in USA"". Fortunately Amazon is great about returns and I am requesting an exact replacement. Hopefully it will be right this time. For now, this was one Christmas 2009 MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. In all fairness, the person whom the gift was for was delighted and thought it was going to be a great deck, also liked the pictures. If you can get a FULL and COMPLETE deck I would then assume that IF you are going to be giving it as a gift to a person knowledgable in these things, I am sure they will be delighted."
3,"great deck, bad book","I first saw this deck online at a tarot review website, and fell in love with the design and graphics. I was thrilled when I got it, and the graphics were everything I'd hoped for. It's beautiful, the mix of photography, digital art and colouring is well blended and I really love the historic landmarks they used.However.The book, quite frankly, sucks. While I appreciated the explanations of the revised Major Arcana, it's interpretations leave a great deal to be desired. Instead of the traditional idea that a card reversed is opposite in it's original meaning, here reversed is almost universally negative. Trust me, you do *not* want to get the 9 of swords reversed with this book! Instead of a normal 50/50 chance of a negative result, it's increased to something like a 75 % chance of a negative result. Ick. I dislike the stacking of the odds.I still love the deck, but the book's been gathering dust for years."
4,Beautiful and earthy,"I want to say that it is a beautiful deck with one problem I found.The pictures were NOT what I expected. They are scanned pictures of real people in costume merged over an artistic background. I would have preferred all art and not real people pictures.I would suggest looking at the deck in person if you can before you decide to own a set, just to make sure you are getting what you want."
2,"Pretty, but not very Celtic","I was sucked into buying this deck due to the images. As I looked at it, I found it to be less Celtic than Wiccan. The ""Lord"" and ""Lady"" cards are just one example of their misinterpretations of Celtic lore. Courtney Davis' Celtic Tarot is far more accurate, allowing for the fact that tarot's an import into the system in the first place."
1,So good you can feel the fear!!,"I love cheaply made, hope to be ""debunk"" documentaries, and this film is no exception. Lets not forget here people that the reason anyone would even bother to make a ""debunk"" film is if they are afraid of something. If you knew you were in the right, then you would have nothing to worry about. A fellow reviewer stated that this film is full of historical evidence that proves the outlandish claims in the Da Vinci code are false. I'm sorry but I don't see the King James Bible as a historical reference. Keep in mind children, I don't buy everything the Da Vinci code say's either, but don't let some frighten old men think for you. Never be afraid to think for yourself, and that is precisely what this film does not want you to do. Two thousand years of carefully orchestrated control is a hell of a thing to lose."
4,flashback...to the year 2000-2001,"Flashback...the the old Sonic afterhours club in Davie,FL A guy called Paul (later re-christened Paul Bunyan) is in his car giving some girl he met at the club a foot massage while Huda Hudia's Y2Funk was playing full blast. The girl, known only as ""Terradactyl Toes"" to me and my club going partner is sitting in the back of his car while he is massaging away in the front seat! Y2funk was the soundtrack to those late nights/early mornings at the afterhours."
4,XVIII century England and US yarn at its best,"One of the four Shellabarger historical novels, this time set in the middle XVIII century. The reader travel from Venice to London, the American Colonies and Canada, conversing with ""maestro"" Carlo Goldoni, hearing a sermon from John Wesley or being witness at the death of Marquiss Montcalm. No doubt a mature novel with all the ingredients of fine romance ( illegitimate children, an obscure chap suddenly lionized in fashion society, true love - just the hero can't realize it till the end ). Not as good as ""Captain of Castile"" and ""Prince of Foxes "" ( the best Shellabarger novels to me ) but enjoyable as well if you like Dumas, Sabatini or Orczy works. Just one advice: it seems unfinished at all by his creator."
3,Not as plush as pictured,It's kinda cute as an accessory. The product is not as plush as pictured and the ends are pelts sewn into balls. This will not keep you warm.
2,Plastic!,"This American Standard handshower wall bracket is described at various sites as chrome-plated brass. I ordered it along with 2 chrome Kohler Forte robe hooks. All arrived today. The wall bracket is in fact worthless plastic and will have to be returned. The Kohler robe hook is heavy chromed brass, nicely made, so I immediately went online to a Kohler wall bracket that looks like the American Standard one--sure that I'd find it to be brass--and found customer statements saying, contrary to claims, it too is plastic. Are the manufacturers lying? What would be the point? It's not as though we can't tell the difference. I now don't know where to find a legitimate handshower wall bracket in this style."
2,not as advertized,The package promises introductions to each film and chapter selections. The root menu shows two films and when picked the film starts. NO introduction and no chapter selection. Quality of transfer changes and at times shakes which can be distracting.
4,Kids of Survival,"This is a very interesting DVD about a very interesting project, of the kind that I particularly like (using the arts to benefit individuals and allow them to participate). I would have given it five stars except that the ""story line"" isn't quite as clear as I'd like. But--it's good and well worth seeing."
4,Great guide and index for creative dance lessons,"I am really enjoying this book, a kind of guide and lesson index of teaching creative dance. The first half contains the elements of dance, everything you need to learn about to build a strong foundation. It emphasizes the PEG method and shows the ways to use it. The second half (or more like 1/3 of the book) lists lessons that are suitable for various age groups. There are lessons based on elements and lessons based on imagery. Towards the end of the book there is a chapter on extending the lessons and it highlights way to make the lesson more meaningful and relevant to the students. It focuses on using the imagination to make the lessons more interesting. Overall, I think the book is a great guide for a beginner in the subject of teaching creative dance to children."
5,What the movie should have been...,"According to some sources who attended a screening of Ultraviolet, the ""rough cut"" of the film contained approximately half an hour of footage that was cut from the theatrical version. The removal of this footage seriously undermined the coherency of the story and the development of the characters (the same thing happened to Alien3). This novelization, being based on the original screenplay instead of the theatrical cut, restores these missing plot and character elements. Considering that I rather liked UV to begin with, it goes without saying that I like the book even more. By telling the story the way it was meant to be told, it gives us all the more reason to demand a genuine Director's Cut of the film. Until then... FLAMING SWORDFIGHT IN THE DARK! OMG!"
3,Amusing,"Aside from the title song (one that I heard Mr. Feinstein perform years ago on Oprah), there are only a few tracks that I really liked. I found the interjection of the children's voices to be annoying. I think this CD could have been better."
4,A lucky find,"I happened upon this album when I was looking for a CD for my six month old. Teddy Bears' Picnic has always been one of my favorite songs and my daughter & I thoroughly enjoy MF's rendition. This album will surely be one of her favorites, it's already one of mine."
4,classic kids' songs revisited,I loved this album! Feinstein brings together traditional classics as well as comedic songs like Dr. Seuss's Dressing Song and Lydia the Tattooed Lady. Adults as well as children will cheer this wonderful collection of tunes.
1,Also disappointed,"I was looking for a lighthearted CD for my four-month old son and was disappointed with this one. I found Feinstein's singing forced and annoying and felt he was, at times, singing down to children. BTW, Kenny Loggins does a fabulous job with ""Pure Imagination""; he also sounds much more genuine and loving singing children's songs than Feinstein does."
1,Picture is not what you get,"I ordered this item, because I originally lost mine. What arrived was not what was pictured and not even in the same category.Amazon was kind enough to try and correct the problem, so they shipped me another one free of charge. Only now I have two of something I don't want or need.FYI"
1,no good.,- the text has lots of gaps. steps are missing.- the screenprints are tiny. it's hard for me to read themeven with a magnifying glass.- there are no callouts.this book is no good.
2,Quick guide for using Outlook 2000,"The author is already a classic in this kind of guides. He doesn't write about the program in depth, but he just references the most basic issues about its installation and how to start to use it. So, if you have never work with Outlook before, you will get a general idea about it in the shortest time. Don't buy it if you are looking for an easy way of finding the Outlook 2000 new feautures ."
5,Nice tones!,I enjoy playing this Agogo and the stem has a nice muted tones. I've pulled 12 distinct tones and hues from this instrument. BIG BANG FOR THE BUCK.
2,Does not shut off water as well as other brands,"I used to have a button on my shower head to turn off the water while I put conditioner and other things and would keep the temp. It is a great feature. I change my shower head, but wanted and missed the shut off button. I gave this 2 stars because it was better than nothing, but not even close to other one. I had to re buy this item. Maybe it should have one star only. I found one here and was more careful when reading the reviews. It is also a button style and works SOOO much better! Just like my old shower head!"
1,Who wants a valve that doesn't shut off the water?,"Sure, it's a heavy duty valve, but it doesn't stop the water from dripping heavily. I expect that it would fill up an 8oz glass in 1 or 2 minutes. Simply unacceptable."
2,Well built but poor performance.,This controller looks nice and solid but leak when it is close. I do not know if it is bad design or bad luck.
2,Not as good as I hoped,"Although the product was definitely better quality than the valve I replaced, it definitely did NOT provide 100% flow shotuff. It wasn't even close. The remaining flow is significantly more than dripping and closer to a weak stream. It does REDUCE the flow, but certainly does not shut it off."
2,It Leaks,I presently have a plastic shower cut off valve That I wanted to replace with a more permanent brass valve. I received the valve and it leaks past the cut off worse than the cheap plastic one. I paid $10.00 in shipping to Alaska! Where's the American craftsmanship?
5,Does a great job,I bought this item to help me save water while in the shower. It was very easy to install (just used some plumbers tape to seal) and it has been working ever since. Perfect for those who want so save water without losing water temp.
1,leaks,"I ordered two, both items are made of heavy chromed brass with an easy to use on off valve however they both leak when off at just over a drips rate."
3,These were purchased by my husband . .,"I haven't heard any complaints about this product, so I'm guessing they are doing what they are supposed to. I know my husband was happy with the Amazon price and he received them quickly."
2,Valve leaks,Valve leaks. Unable to shut off water completely. Only goodfor reducing the flow of shower water. I would try anotherbrand. Thank you.
3,"Good valve, threads leak if not taped.","Seems to be a good valve for flow regulation. As others have mentioned, it does leak quite a bit. I think a little teflon tape will fix that though."
2,Not as expected...,"I purchased this book to find good information on energy healing. This book is a disappointment. About a half of it - I consider as an advertisement of the Healing Touch program and certification. You do not need to be a nurse or massage therapist in order to help and heal others, nor to be a certified in HT.This book is not for a BEGINNER, it has a very little understandable info on energy healing basics. I have to give it a credit for a few healing practices that I found interesting. That is it, nothing new or unique, as they claim.I would suggest Barbara Brennan ""Hands of Light"" for anyone interested in learning energy healing."
5,Healing Touch,Reccommended reading for Healing Touch certification. Have not started this yet but look forward to reading this before enrolling in Level II.
5,One of The Best,"Of all the books I have purchased on Healing Touch, this is definately one of the best. It covers most areas one would need to begin a Healing Touch practice. I recommend it with confidence."
5,love them,"Best shoe I own. I wear them with a gray summer business suit or with classy shorts and shirt. I wear them to meetings, wore them to Europe. High quality is all I can say. Well worth the $300 I paid at Nordi. Had a black pair - just bought a brown pair through amazon. Treat yourself to the best - you get what you pay for."
1,Pretty but painful!,"I tried them on at a shoe store,they seemed fine. I bought them on line. They were too tight. I called the Mephisto website. The lady told me that they should be more comfortable after the 2nd time I wore them--REALLY--WELL NOT REALLY! So I tried wearing them--the 1st day--an hour or so. Did not hurt much but TOO tight! Pain on my insteps and my RIGHT arch ONLY-- after wearing them a little the second day. I'd return them but I unfortunately stumbled and scuffed them. So now--the shoe stretcher and investigating how to push down the right arch support enough,but not too much. Anyone,know what I should do? They are nice looking shoes but I think I'm the mouse caught in the mousetrap of beauty. Also, they soil easily on the suede like nubuck. So far a big disappointment!"
1,"What are you talking about, MACY????","I ordered Villeroy & Boch Dune Bread and Butter Plates, Set of 6 but I got just one plate.And they responsed that set of 6 means the size of plate.I was very frustrated and I'll never order any items from amazon macy.Max. 400 characters, no HTML Characters remaining: 182"
1,What's exact q'ty?,"I ordered this, 2sets and get only 2 plates.It mentioned set of 6, and 6pcs are mentioned in description, too.However Macy's insisted $20.xx is for only 1 plate.So I returned it to Macy's.I still don't understand this kind of unfaithful deal."
4,the best of the three new reissues,"The best of the three new reissues is Get Up With It. Released just before Miles `retirement,' Get Up With It was another 2LP collection of outtakes (this time from 1970-74), and most of it was quite good. Disc one starts with the dark, ultra cool ""He Loved Him Madly."" Dedicated to the life and works of Duke Ellington, the 32-minute track is an eerie piece of music that grabs your attention and never lets go. ""Maiysha"" starts off in a funky, almost tropical groove, then after about 10 minutes, McLaughlin comes over the top with a blazing, abrasive guitar solo. Other highlights include the extended fusion workout, ""Calypso Frelimo,"" ""Red China Blues,"" and the hard driving ""Mtume."""
5,"""Get Up With It"" stays up with it!","The Great Lost Miles Davis Album! Now available as part of Columbia's impressive re-issue project. This CD was originally released as a ""double-album"" featuring then-recently-recorded music and tracks that had not quite made the cut for previous releases (these are not below-par ""out-takes"" - tracks like ""Honky Tonk"" featuring Keith Jarrett & John McLaughlin, and ""Rated X"" by the 'On The Corner' ensemble, are first-rate. If you truly enjoy 70s-era Miles, you cannot pass this one by. (And Play It Loud!)"
5,THE MAN!,Miles Davis is THE MAN.You Gotta Give it Up to the Man who Re-invented himself for 5 Deacdes.most of the Busters out now will be forgotten in 5 years.this is True Musical Talnet here.this Album is 70's Slamming Miles Music.His Band is Grooving as well.The Grooves are Tight.The Man Could so many Styles it was Amazing.Folks Tired of Junk that's Out Now Get Addicted To This GENIUS.REAL MUSIC FOR REAL EARS.HE Changed The Game Forever.
2,Disappointed,"Yes, there are algorithms here, but they are not only a mishmash, but not very important ones"
1,Worthless Purchase,"I only give this a 1 because I can't choose a zero.Whomever wrote the puzzles for this book obviously doesn't know the rules of sudoku:No number can appear twice within a column, row, or 9-box sub-section (nor located in the same box within the 9-box sub-section). I'm a sudoku fanatic, so I'm very versed in the rules. When I sat down and started working the puzzles, I found myself running up against instances on every puzzle where the same number would have to appear in the upper left hand box of each sub-section twice within the same puzzle (which is a BIG no-no). When this happened 10 times in a row, I went back to the answer page and discovered all of the puzzles had this defect.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!"
1,Product shipped without stands vertical position,Ordered the product twice. Expected it to ship with the stands so it could be installed in the vertical position. Both times the product arrived without the vertical stands. Returned the product twice and gave up.
5,Durable and good for even abnormal use,"My computer system is not what you would call normal, it is mounted in a box truck that is always on the move. The conditions are dusty, hot and about a bad as it can get for a computer. This APC backup system has done a great job at keeping my computer up while I travel, without ac power, from one place to another.It has only one drawback, that will rarely effect any normal user, it won't run on a modified sine wave that is produced by most, dc to ac inverters.Other than that, this battery is great!"
5,dee lite world clique review,"i had this album on casette when it first came out, so i thought i would now purchase it on cd. but its an awesome album, each song is unique. its a very funky dance album..."
4,A CD worth 16 years looking for...,"`World Clique' manages to avoid the bargain bin; one hit, that's it. With `Groove is in the Heart' to the bonus track `Build a Bridge'... `World Clique' is literally a dance party in a CD and holds up after the album release 16 years ago."
2,Amazing! Now!,"The jury is back and the bailiff can't stop glancing at the verdict papers. I'm hearing this ten years later and I wouldn't touch it with lemon kid-gloves an inch thick! The re-mix job by DJ Contemptible Teen is a no-show. Wonderful music to play sitting in the dark with the shades drawn after a long, hard day behind the lawnmower."
1,catchy 10 years back bland now,this disc was catchy 10 years back but nothing worth keeping.Groove is in the Heart was about it.much like the B-52's pretty campy.
5,Excellent,"Though I read it in the Hebrew, the story was so rich and intriguing that the translation sure transmits the wonder and excitement of this book. Through style and story, Zizag Kid is a success."
4,Just a quick note from a hebrew speaking reader of the book,Just thought I'd point out that the kid's name is actually Nono... (I read the book in hebrew..)
3,grim but well written,too gloomy for but Istar was an awful place. I don't recommend unless you like depressing books
5,a must have for people that have bad eye sight,this thing is awesome i used to have to get 2 to 3 inches away from my old key board to be able to see to type now i can sit up straight like a normal person it also has very sensitive keys for easy typeing im very happy with it
4,ENTER key,"The position of your ENTER key is farther right than all the other keyboards I have used. Thus, I keep hitting the slash key.I'm sure I'll get used to it soon, but it is very annoying at this time.Love the large letters, though ... I'm dealing with macular degeneration.Sari Aizley"
5,Great keyboard,If you have trouble seeing the letters and numbers on your current board; then buy this one. I love the solid feel to the touch as i am typing. i can type quite quickly and find that the slightly raised keys make a big difference in hitting the right keys. They seem slightly larger as well so for larger or arthritic hands it helps a great deal. If I ever need to buy another keyboard it will be this one for sure. I give it full marks all round.
1,Don't use this Vendor for EZsee keybords by DC,"I ordered an EZsee large print keyboard by DC as a gift. It loaded on the Mac computer and worked for about 45 days. After that numerous keys would not function. The keyboard is junk. It is not worth spending the money to return it to the vendor.I am amazed that Amazon.com would use vendors that sell such crap. Problems like this really affect Amazon's credibility when selecting quality vendors.I ordered another large print keyboard from another manufacturer and vendor through Amazon.com. Hopefully, the quality will be significantely better.Charles Morrison"
3,overly light weight,"Ordered this to replace a defective ""KEYS U SEE"" keyboard, & it in my option is over priced for what you get. The keyboard is so light weight while typing its flopping all over the place. The smaller profile of it is nice. Keyboard work but just feels, sounds, types to cheap for me. I returned it."
5,A Great Item,This Large print is just great for this senior!!!!!! I Recommend this for anyone with vision problems!! I Just Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Failed after 6 months,"This product does what is expected, as advertised. I bought it for a friend who has vision loss. She loved it..., until the SPACEBAR failed. So I bought her another one. It should have lasted longer. But other than that, it was perfect."
3,Large print keyboard,"For sure, the printing on the keys is larger than standard. However, I had trouble using it because the key spacing was closer; I was making a lot of typographical errors. I think it would be great for slower typists, but I am a person who types fast, and it didn't work for me."
5,Insight and Guidance for Boomers Dealing with Elder Care,"Sue Cunningham has written a little gem of a book that is both insightful and practical. Drawing on her years of experience working with the children of aging parents, she has collected a series of pithy stories and observations that simultaneously inspire and educate. A recommended read for professionals and children of elders alike!"
2,im really diappointed,"F.W.I. I OWN THIS DVD. I gave this dvd 2 stars because i enjoy some of this dvd like when they are recording for their albums or some of the pranks in here. Like another reviewer said this dvd has little live footage and if they show it, a majority is just songs of of the albums instead of hearing the live song. I am disappointed of this dvd. This dvd also has orgy's 4 music videos, 4 pure tracks, some pictures of each member, and thank you's. You should stay away from this unless you want to be completely bored for about 3 hours. to make a long story short : this dvd sucks"
5,Why 5 stars,"Ok im totally desagree with the person who says that cant belive than ppl rate this item before saw it, well let me explane to you its like a diary dvd with videos and the all story before tha band its nothing new so we know what we can spect about itso orgy rocks and you sucks"
2,"did not work on my DVD player, appears to be home made copy","This ""DVD"" did not work in my DVD player. It worked only on my computer's DVD drive. Disc looked different on the side that is read, different than a normal DVD. Annoying. The movie was in high enough visual quality to watch the fight scenes. Maybe the more expensive DVD of this film can be played on ALL name-brand DVD players."
1,Disappointing,"Im a spoiled fan of Chan in Western flicks, and was expecting more of the same. Wrong. The characters and plot were sophomoric and mostly a clumsy attempt at Three-Stooges type comedy. Example - when not in their black ""uniform,"" the scowling bad Ninjas appear in 50's style zoot-suits and broad-brimmed hats (except the sexy female baddie). The two main fight scenes (very early, and at the end) totaled about 10-15"" and were classic Chan. Otherwise, a much better investment of time and bucks is Li's ""Fearless."""
5,fun with the lucky stars gang!,"I really liked this comedy about the lucky stars gang!it's the second in the series! all the great hongkong stars are there...Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao , Sammo Hung , Richard Ng...and of course a whole lot of baddies who they get to fight! really funny and great action!"
3,not a great jackie move,ok this move is funny but the only good action is at the end and it is mosle fist fiting no using odd objects like a lader ect but the fiting at the end was wiy it got a 3 not a 1. If you like the odd objects that he fits with than this move is not for you but than agin this is my opion not yours
3,The Sequal That's Worst Than The First One.,"My Lucky Stars is a Sequal to Winners And Sinners, which wasn't so good. This one is worse than Winners And Sinners because the humor in this one is ten times more stupid, less action, and the quality is not good at all. Once again the reason I give this movie any stars at all because of Jackie Chan and his action scenes. The ending is one of the best action scenes you will find."
4,"Enjoyable, Reasonably Sturdy Product","Have used this board several times over the course of a handful of seasons. I am well over six-feet tall and a bit over 200 lbs., and the board feels big and sturdy enough for me. It has dented pretty readily on the top, but not so much that it has affected performance. The leash attachment at the board end has come untied on a couple of occasions, which can be quite annoying when you are in heavy surf. Overall, it seems to have been a decent product for the price. It has been enjoyed the most when used in combination with short fins."
5,A GRATEFUL HEART,A LOVELY BOOK OF DAILY THOUGHTS ON GRATITUDE FOR MEALTIME OR ANYTIME. I READ IT DAILY AND HAVE PURCHASED MORE COPIES TO SHARE WITH FRIENDS.
1,Misled,"We have been looking for food blessings to extend our repertoire and keep us mindful of the food we are given at the evening meal. The sub-title of this book, ""Daily Blessing for the Evening Meal,"" led us to believe we had found exactly what we needed. However, I challenge anyone to find more than three or four blessings in this little volume that would properly and sweetly bless the food we were about to eat. Some are absolutely inappropriate and unappetizing; others, so far afield we wondered what they were doing in this book. We were very disappointed."
5,Inspirations that go beyond mealtime blessings,"This diverse collection of beautiful prayers and blessings contains themes which are relevant to whatever gathering I'm a part of. I have used the blessings to begin meetings, as part of a presentation, at family mealtime and for my personal inspriation. I have bought my own copy and have given two other copies as gifts. The language of each blessing speaks very powerfully."
5,Thank You,Finally a good metal No no no scratch that a BRILLIANT metal magazine from the US.Many have tried and have made good attempts but not been consistant.Decibel has a great overall look glossy pages good pictures (but thankfully not just another picture mag)and good sensible reviews unlike some other mags that just say an album is no good they tell you why it is good or no good.It features all kinds of metal but seems to keep each issue with something for eveyone and is priced very reasonably.Thank You Everyone at decibeland KUDOS for the free shirt with subsription
4,A Mystery Classic,"The MaelstromI found this little gem while looking through free and cheap Kindle eBooks. I love British Detective Fiction, and this was a really good one. I must confess that I had never heard of Frank Froest before seeing this book. There is a really good article on Wikipedia about him which peaked my interest in his book. There are a few not-so-politically correct terms in his book, but this was published in 1916 so that is to be expected. I must admit to being confused by a few of the terms I found, including one of the criminals calling the police ""gazebos."" Most of the terms I was unfamiliar with were available in the dictionary on Kindle.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes British Detective stories. I plan on reading his other books as well."
4,Well made,"Belkin, as usual delivers a well produced product. These connectors crimp very easily and do not come apart. And for me, more importantly, they snap securely into a standard RJ45 jack without coming unseeded."
3,Priced right -- no frills,"A good deal especially for fixed installations, but I would have preferred to pay a bit more for strain reliefs."
3,"Not bad, could be cheaper","I have ethernet runs running through my house all over the place and I ran out of plugs. These are the cheapest I could find that were available with Prime but now that they're an add-on item I would much rather buy the $1.00 pack from Fry's the next time I'm there. Sure, there's a bit of gas involved but if you're already at the physical store then you can consider it null."
2,Not the same!!!,"Our daughter loves the puppet in the Baby Shakespeare video -- Bard, the Poetic Dragon. It was quite disappointing for us to discover that the character in this book is not Bard, the ""star"" of the Shakespeare video, but some unknown lizard character. Needless to say, the book doesn't grab our daughter's attention because she doesn't recognize that character. No wonder there's no photo of the book cover in it's listing here, on Amazon."
3,Skip this one,This is a companion for the baby shakespear video. Basically it features the poems from that video. If you bought the video with the book then don't buy this because you are waisting your money. There aren't enought bright intresting pictures in this. Also the poems are too difficult for young children to read. My son just doesn't find this intresting. This was a wasted purchase because I had this on video and a book. I didn't need it a third time. It lacked orginality. Save your money and buy a different book
3,Introduces Poetry to Young Children,"In ""Baby Einstein: Poems for Little Ones,"" William Shakespeare, W. B. Yeats, Tennessee Williams, and Langston Hughes come together, with a few other poets, and beautiful photographs, in a charming board book.The concept is simple: Each spread follows a theme. For example, a portion of a poem by Yeats about a cat is on the left, with a 't' printed in large letters. On the right is a picture of a cat. There are two questions. In this case, the child is asked about a cat' fur, and about the poem.The photos are average. Although they look like stock pictures, they are still impressive.The strength is the combination.The poems are between 4 and 12 lines. A few are by lesser known poets, but still introduce a child to the language and imagery of poetry.I fully recommend ""Baby Einstein: Poems for Little Ones.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
4,Unique,"This CD is worth the asking price just for ""Deliver Me"", an achingly beautiful song that simply stops time."
3,their ok,these seat covers are nice but they already ripped at the seams. they still look nice and serve their purpose though
3,"""Specially designed for compact cars...""","....that is a quote off the box it came in. It didn't seem that obvious on the website when I ordered it, so I thought I would highlight it for others. We have a mid-sized SUV and this didn't cover the seat; it was barely wide enough for my Britax car seat. For example, the ""storage pouch"" was laying flat on the seat rather than hanging over the end. Buyer be aware if you have a normal or larger size vehicle."
5,Keeps the seat clean!,I purchased this product for my 5 year old to go under his booster when we bought our newest vehicle. I needed a second for our 1 year old. I love the seat protector. It is sturdy and easy to fit the seat. I love that it has pockets for my 5 yr old's little toys and sunglasses. He knows exactly where to find them now. I keep extra wipes and pacies in the pockets for my 1 year old. Great purchase. Will get another for the next baby!
3,"Good quality, small size...",The material is great however; its a bit on the small side. I have 2012 Jetta and the front flap does not even hang over the seat. A little disappointed with this.
4,For First Years True Fit Convertible Seat - NICE,"Liking it so far. Got it for our First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat and it fits just right. Our back seats are kind of deep so we can't really use the pockets in front, but all I really care about is seat coverage and it definitely does that."
4,"A bit small, but does the trick","Bought this for the First Years True Fit Convertible seat and it fit like a glove. I could see where if you were expecting a Large product, this only prevents the base from sticking and a little bit of the back...."
4,car seat protector,"Just started leasing a new car and was freaking out about my son spilling something or his car seat ruining the car's back seat. This will definitely protect it, I can sleep a little easier now."
2,Made for small cars,This says right on the box that it is made for smaller cars and it was a bit too small to provide the proper coverage for our seats. If you don't have a small car I'd reccommend another choice. We sent them back.
2,Too narrow.,"I bought this to protect the leather seats in a 2011 Prius. We rotate two car seats - a Graco Nautilus, and a Britax Marathon, both of which are an inch wider than than the footprint of the Prince Lionheart Seatsaver. It therefore doesn't prevent the car seat base from digging in. The top portion does a decent job of protecting the lumbar of the leather seat."
2,"Not for rear facing, seat slides on it too.","The price was right on for this product but that's about where my satisfaction ends. I have an Evenflo convertible carseat which I am still using rear facing for my 19 month old. I did not get the seatsaver version with the taller part on the back because I already had a kick pad for my son to protect the seat back. I have a newer model Honda Civic and this seatsaver does not fit well from front to back, the pockets are way up on the seat and unusable for storage. The carseat also slides around on the hard plastic top of the saver. The saver does NOT move around on the seat and it is easy to get to the LATCH system since the notches are large which is nice. Wish this product was larger overall and had the no-slip grip on both sides. So no I would not recommend it for a convertible carseat in an '09 Honda Civic. I have not tried it with my carseat forward facing so I cannot review for that function."
3,Too Small,"My wife bought this item. When we got it, turns out it did not cover our seats enough to be of any use. We have a Suburban. Sending it back was easy enough though. Thanks Amazon."
3,Frisell drizzles dazzle,"3 1/2Not as melodically astute or compositionally engaging as the brilliant guitarist's top-tiered solo outings, but a diverse and technically wondrous smattering of early excellence nonetheless."
4,Great educational toy!,"I bought this toy for my niece for her first birthday. I loved it because it teaches her Spanish in a fun way. The only thing I didn't like was that it did not have the same lessons in English. Nevertheless, my niece loves it because the antlers lights up. Great gift to introduce Spanish into your child's life."
4,Classic,"This is a great sampling of true a capella. Rockapella's ""Zombie Jamboree"" is great, but the Mint Julips steal the show. They are easily one of the best female groups around, and they're take on ""Higher and Higher"" is absolutely fantastic!"
5,The Best A Capella Album to Date!,"I have always been a fan of harmony; and a capella harmony in particular. This disk has it all! For years I looked for ""Doo Wop Music"" as a catagory in the record stores. No one knew what I was talking about. This is definitely all that AND a bag of chips! Zombie Jamborie by rockapella is incredible! If it doesn't get your motor running, then it flat can't get started! The Mint Juleps accompanied by Ladysmith Black Mambaso does the best rendition of ""The Lion Sleeps"" that has ever been done. Suffice it to say; if this is even a passing interest for you, then this is your album!"
2,not what we ordered!,"First off, we received a full fledged bikini, not a camkini like we ordered. Because we were leaving on vacation right away we kept it. However, after the first trip to the pool, the bikini had faded noticeably. After two weeks of swim time, it was barely colored anymore. I wondered if we had gotten a Speedo knock-off. It was a less than $25 suit, but not a less than $5 suit. If I had bought it from a store, I would have taken it back as soon as our vacation ended. What a disappointment!"
5,Love it,This is one of the best bible/Jesus movies....it can drag on though a bit long but its so accurate that its worth it to get the true story...good acting i thought for these types of movies
4,Gives viewer a firm grasp on a hard book to handle.,"The book of John has always been of interest to me. I can read it again and again and still never feel like I have a good handle on it. No pithy parables as in Matthew or Luke. No traveling miracle show as in Mark. John asks you to talk one on one with Jesus. So it is in this movie. But the very traits of the book of John is what makes the movie version so good. It is personal, in your face and one on one.As far as shots, costume, acting, locations, effects . . . . it sets a new standard.The only gripe I had was the version they used. But that is purely a personal choice. Would love to see a movie use ""The Message"". It would match the beauty seen on screen with phrases of equal grandure."
5,Great movie,"""The Gospel of John"" is one of the best portrayals of the life of Christ that I have ever seen. Content is very accurate throughout"
5,Possibly the best rendition of Christ and His ministry in movie history,"The best movie adaptation of the ministry of Jesus Christ according to the Gospel of John in every respect - authenticity, acting, mood. Nothing to do with the sentimental and ill-shaped productions often produced by many Christian film projects on the Bible. This film is a moving experience that will change even skeptics of the faith. Comparable only with the ""Passion of Christ"", but this one has a broader vision and scope. Fully appropriate for smaller children."
4,Well Done and Inspiring,"The ""Gospel of John"" was I felt, very true to the spirit of the Gospel. The actor portraying Jesus did a good job, and the narrator's voice was a great touch. I enjoyed the three-hour theatrical version with the full reading of the text of the Gospel by the announcer more than the two-hour version."
4,Well worth the time and money,"Because the ""script"" for this movie is the words of the actual Gospel of St. John, there isn't much you can fault- maybe the translation- about the content of the film. I was disturbed by the casting of an older woman as the Mother of God since tradition tells us that she actually was very young.The images are sumptuous and the music most appropriate.My kids liked it. That's the real test of something in my house. Anything that gets their minds out of the gutter of electronic games and TV is a hit with me. An excellent movie for Lent."
4,BEAUTIFUL AND MOVING,"WHAT A POWERFUL AND MOVING FILM. MADE IN 2003 IT HAD VIRTUALLY GONE UNNOTICED. THERE IS SOMETHING VERY PURE AND GENUINE ABOUT THIS FILM.THIS FILM DOESN'T INSULT THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE VIEWER AS THE MORE RECENT BIG BUDGET HOLLYWOOD FILM THAT DEPICTS THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST WITH ITS GRATUITOUS SCENES OF VIOLENCE. I RENTED THIS DVD AND VIEWED IT WITH MY YOUNG DAUGHTER, AND FELT THAT PEOPLE OF ANY AGE CAN FIND IT INSPIRING."
5,Great depiction of Jesus on the earth,This is a fabulous depiction of Jesus Christ on the earth and his followers according to the Book of John in the Bible. Henry Ian Cusick is stellar in his portrayal of Jesus in this movie. His acting skills create such a believable portrayal of the greatest man that ever lived. It is a must see for all ages. The film is a very valuable teaching tool.
5,Excellent Movie,I truly enjoyed The Gospel of John. This is a word-for-word depiction of the Book of John and is quite entertaining. Henry Cusick and the supporting cast do a masterful job and seem to capture the essence of the Scriptures in their performances. I would recommend this movie to all!
5,Excellent!!!,"This is a faithful representation of the Gospel of St. John - word for word. The best that I have seen... And, the casting for this movie is exceptional. I have watched this repeatly over the last few years and given as a gift to many whom I knew would appreciate it. It is also an excellent study aid for children. Worth every cent."
5,Incredible movie at incredible price,This is word for word from the Gospel of John and excellent theatrics together and the price can't be beat!
3,Tells the Story without the Excitement,"I suppose this production does what it sets out to do. It is supposed to be a dramatization of the Gospel according to St. John. It is fairly accurate in this respect. The parts of the Gospel that consist of narrative are narrated. Where speech is pout into peoples' mouth in the gospel, so to do those parts appear that way in the film. Throughout it all, the scenes are re-enacted fairly well. With all of this attention to detail, it is a shame that it can be fairly boring.The parts are often portrayed with excitement and enthusiasm by the actors but that same excitement does not translate itself to the viewer. This is a sad fate for the ""Greatest Story Ever Told"".Though it is not particularly exciting, it does a fair job of conveying the story. It is relevant and the story is timeless. As a pastor, I would wish that in addition to the story it would have conveyed the passion of the Passion story. To me, it did not."
1,Mary Magdalen?,"I saw this film on the big screen, drove miles to see it. It started great, the photography and costumes were beautiful, character portrayals were better than average.But who was that woman hanging out with the guys all the time? Apparently the screen writers thought they could improve on the Gospel-as-originally-written and made Mary Magdalen into a sort of 13th apostle. Why, why, why? Why isn't the Gospel good enough as it is? Why do people have to throw in their private improvements? I can only suppose that, if they were Jesus, they would have done things differently."
1,The Gospel of John,Unfortunately I am unable to provide a review for the 'Gospel of John' DVD that was sent recently because the DVD that was sent is for replay on NTSC. I live in Australia where we need a PAL version. I was surprised to receive an NTSC DVD of the Gospel of John when the delivery address was to Australia where NTSC DVD's are not playable. Therefore the DVD received from Amazon is of no use to me.
1,What they don't tell you,Unfortunately this product was not labeled for use in the US only. I cannot view the DVD in Australia. So 'buyer beware'. What a rip off. I had to give it one star because the system would allow none.
1,biblical humbug,"The movie was reasonably entertaining but hightly offensive if one is not a believer in biblical truth. I wish I had known ahead of time that this was a movie designed for the Christian right. I wouldn't have waisted my time. But, I went to see Christopher Plummer and at a minimum enjoyed his talent."
1,A work of fiction based on a work of fiction...,"I agree with the person from La Canada, Calif. I don't know why so much money is wasted on productions like this. Couldn't that money be better spent helping those in need rather than furthering a myth? Based on the reviews I read, I can see why some people would fall for this. Since I had to give it a star rating I gave it the lowest possible... it actually deserves a minus rating."
4,A Great Film Overall,"I suspect the problem every filmmaker runs into when adapting the bible to film is when you dramatize it, you add life to the project, but run into danger of straying from the true scripture. While on the other hand, if you stay completely true to the scripture telling, you run the risk of a dry presentation.That being said, this is the best adaptation of the bible to film I have seen. My only complaint about this video is the actors seem to pause while the narrator (Christopher Plummer) reads the scripture. It makes the film drag a bit at times, but otherwise this is a great little film to watch. Henry Ian Cusick does a powerful job of performing Jesus in the film, and the other actors do a fine job as well.I bought this DVD, and I'm glad. It's one I want to have on hand to see again and again. It was definitely well worth the investment."
4,LOVELY FILM BUT BEWARNED...,"THIS IS A BEAUTIFULLY REALIZED FILM OF WHAT IS PERHAPS THE LOVELIEST NARRATIVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. BUT, THE TEXT HAS BEEN TRANSLATED IN SUCH A WAY SO THAT THE PHYSICAL INTIMACY BETWEEN JESUS AND THE DISCIPLE WHOM HE LOVED, AT THE LAST SUPPER, HAS BEEN EDITED OUT OF THE TEXT. INTERESTINGLY, THE ACTOR CAST IN THE ROLE OF THE BELOVED DISCIPLE COULD HARDLY BE MORE HOMELY OR UNATTRACTIVE. IN FACT, THE ACTOR PLAYING THE BELOVED DISCIPLE APPEARS, IF ANYTHING, TO BE OLDER THAN JESUS. INTERESTING CHOICES FOR A FILM BOASTING ABSOLUTE TEXTUAL AUTHENTICITY. AND, OF COURSE, A VERY CURIOUS OMISSION. OTHER THAN THIS, THE FILM BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTS THE MYSTICAL LOVELINESS AND LYRICISM OF THE GOSPLE OF JOHN NARRATIVE."
3,THE GOSPEL OF JOHN....OK,"Overall, I think it was pretty good and true to the bible. There were some scenes where the acting was lacking but not on the part of Henry Cusick (who played Jesus). He was very good."
5,Everyone should get this DVD,"Good production, the actors were great. The story is well presented, it takes you back 2000 years. After seeing this movie you will understand the message in the Gospel of John better."
5,Gospel of John,"Again. I show this from time to time in a Jail ministry, Word for ward out of the bible to help those to have a visual sense of the bible. I would rate this very highly"
1,"Catholics, don't waste your time","Unfortunately this story has nothing in it at all about John Chapter 6 of the institution of the Eucharist by Jesus. Among other shortcomings, this is by far the worst. Catholics beware. This is not for you."
2,Why does Jesus have that weird smirk on his face?,"My brother raved about this movie, and so I foolishly bought it without seeing it first. What a disappointment. It was long and boring, but worst of all, Jesus walks around the whole time with this odd, vacant half-smile on his face, as if this is just a game. If you want to see a realistic view of Jesus' experience, watch The Passion. Gross, but true-to-life.My last word on the subject: ""loving"" does not equal ""always smiling and soft-spoken."" Ugh."
2,Not Faithful,"The opening credit purports that the story is ""faithful to the Scriptures."" Well, almost. The writer, producer or director must have been influenced by the Dan Brown heresy that Jesus had a girl friend, because the same attractive woman is displayed several times and even sits at the last supper. Show me in any of the New Testament Scriptures where a woman was at the Last Supper with the 12 Apostles. Well, there wasn't any, because it would have been mentioned if true. As soon as I saw this, I stopped watching it. Jesus was without sin, for all you almost-Christians, and as the Son of God bringing salvation to Mankind, had no reason to marry or have a girl friend. Nowhere in the Scriptures, NT or OT, does it mention or allude to this. If you want the true story, read the Synoptic Gospels and the Scriptural Gospel of St. John. Two stars is a gift because of the production values otherwise."
2,"Great on the movie part. Terrible on the ""scholarly"" remarks parts.","This movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portrayingthe Gospel of John beautifully through the movie - and slapping Yahushua/Jesusand serious scholars in the face with the other hand. The so-called ""scholarly""comments, for example about how the Gospel was written 200 years after the events, are by and largeintellectually dishonest and quite simplyinaccurate. Even the lowliest of Bible scholars, if honest, will realize this.It is very sad to see people making a buck off the Bible, while trying to tearit down at the same time. The worst examples of Scripture put downs are in the 3rdDVD. I gave the movie to a relative without that add on."
5,"Perfectly woven, Wholly captivating.",This is so impressively woven. It presents the literary material so cleanly and I actually bought it after a Netflix rental. This is VERY rare for me. The full version is spotless.
4,Emotionally moving and artistic view of the life of Christ Jesus,"My family and I enjoyed this film and its accompanying DVD featuring a revealing documentary about the making of the film and an in-depth commentary feature. For me, the word-by-word film based on the American Bible Society;s Good news Bible spoke to my soul because it transported me to the time and into Jesus' heart. Henry ian Cusick does not give a Hollywood-esque performance as Jesus. He speaks from the heart and often speaks more through simple looks. The cinematographer wisely focuses in on his eyes which are expressive. It is very dramatic yet personal in its feel. I would encourage anyone who loves film and wants to know Jesus in a personal way to see this film. Afterwards, read the Gospel of John. God bless."
3,I am happy with the product.,I was disappointed with the dvd not having the third disc or no information about the third disc. yet the movie was perfect and i have used it for my students.
5,MUST SEE!!!,"THIS IS AMAZING!! If you are a Christian, you MUST see this movie. It is, word for word, line by line, the Gospel of John acted out. AND VERY WELL DONE!! It will give you a better understanding of some of the conversations in the gospel that were difficult to full comprehend before. My kids, ages 10 - 3 LOVE this one! My three year old asks if we can ""watch Jesus"" on a regular basis!!"
5,Awesome!!!,This movie is the best movie to fill your heart with the true knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the scripture perfectly. i watch it over and over even to sleep with. Wonderful actors and best of all the true Spirit of His life flows through as you drink the cup of His life on this earth according to our dear Brother John.I am so thankful for this movie!xox
5,Excellent - True to Scripture,"A word-for-word enactment of John's gospel of Jesus. It captures the struggle between Christ as the unknown commoner and the religious powers of the day as He declares Himself to be the Son of God. The message of the gospel comes forth clearly: believe in Jesus and know the Father, or refuse the Son and lose the Father. No compromises, no apologies.The ""I Am"" declarations of Christ come to life.It's well worth your time. A mountain-top experience that will last for days.I sincerely hope the team will consider similar projects for the other three gospels and the book of Acts."
5,The Best yet. Period.,"This is not only the best Jesus movie I have ever seen (and I've seen a LOT), it is the best Bible movie, period.I stumbled across a showing on TV once, and I could not change it. I immediately purchased a copy and I have seen it over and over again and do not tire of it. I have spoken to a number of other friends about it and many feel the same way.Whoever screenplayed the Jesus character made an excellent choice. He is not too serious, yet not silly (like another I am thinking of). Not ""macho"" looking yet not effeminate either, as many paint him. I was very impressed by the fact that the words are 100% from the Gospel of John. I cannot add anything else, it is and excellent movie!The only regret is I hear that the company that produced it is going through some very difficult financial times and may not be able to produce The Gospel of Mark, as expected. I was SO looking forward to this."
5,The Gospel of John,"The Gospel of John is Biblically sound in its telling of this Gospel. It is educational, spiritually uplifting, and entertaining. I highly recommend The Gospel of John to everyone! My church uses snippets of The Gospel of John during Sunday service. Seeing only portions of this movie has prompted me to purchase my own copy. I am glad I did!"
5,The Gospel of John - a magnificent statement,"The whole movie is a masterpiece of all the Jesus of Nazareth movies I have seen. I brings to the viewer the deep conviction Jesus had to the father. The portrayel of the actor was brilliant, the best Jesus actor I have seen. I purchased the movie for my whole family."
4,This is another keeper.,"I like the video, I already had Matthew and Acts in this same series. I will buy others if/when they come out."
4,Very well done,"This was a well done movie! I loved how they followed the bible word for word. Also, the acting was great, as well as the props. I'm glad to have it as part of my personal library."
4,"Really, really good...but different","I admire artists that follow their own muse, who don't feel called upon to stick in one and only one area, or sing only one kind of song, or whatever. Gatton was one of those artists!! This CD is rather wide-ranging; it covers a lot of ground, with jazz, rock, etc. If you like big, echoey, American-style electric guitar, this is your CD. I could listen to ""Quiet Village"" and ""In My Room"" again and again. I could, on the other hand, cut out ""The Simpsons"", and on some selections there is too much saxophone(those reasons are why I gave the CD only 4 stars). I will undoubtedly purchase another Gatton CD. This is good stuff from someone that, as others have pointed out, ranked among the top guitar players in America. It shows in each and every selection."
4,Fire in his Fingertips,"Danny's style was smokin', slammin', and stretchin' in every direction. An absolute wizard with the flatpick and claw-style of guitar playing. While the solos are head shakers, the magical part is how pretty and complex his chording and rhythmic vamping is. Danny really thought about where he could take a song and the encyclopedic knowledge to produce it . This CD is a hot showcase for a talent that was too big for the masses but WAY,WAY big for the musically inclined. Has a prominent place in my car CD sleeve!!"
5,A virtuoso's best work.,"The guy was a friggin' magician on the guitar. This disc covers so many styles but nonetheless remains tightly knit and cohesive. Country licks, blues, twang, rockabilly, jazz and the Simpsons theme. A superb recording. Serious, fun, deep, shallow. C'mon and dig it."
4,"The excellent, continuing story of the 4 corners region.","Once again, Tony Hillerman has captures his audience as his characters try to make sense out of confusion. Caught in life's personal turmoil, Chee and Leaphorn struggle for answers to unasked questions while trying to solve a crime. Mr Hillerman educates us about the complexities of life, relationships and science in the seemingly remote 4 Corners region where struggle for a simple existence seems to conflict with the need to understand complex problems. Good twists and turns."
4,Hillerman does it again.,A wonderful book. Like all of Hillerman's books I read it in one sitting. If you are familar with the Nation you will find three geographic mistakes. Look for them its part of the fun in reading the book.
5,Hillerman country,"I read every Hillerman novel during a trip to Arizona and Canyon de Chelly. It was a good way to discover Navaho history and culture, past and present. It was perfect reading for the trip and greatly enhanced my experience. I have kept all the books for when I want to relive that trip."
4,"Not one of Hillerman's best, but nevertheless hair-raising!","I found this one not so easy to read, but maybe that is because the Hantavirus problem is not familiar to an European. Anyway, since we discovered Tony Hiller man's novels in a General Store on the way to Zion and Bryce Canyon in 1995 my wife and I are looking forward to each new one. We think that through reading Hiller man's novels we got a better insight into the problems of the American Indians. And it is fun to follow Chee and Leaphorn through the towns and country we have visited already several times."
4,Vintage Hillerman and the Navajos - Fine Read!,"I, too, have read all of Hillerman's books and have enjoyed them all. I really like the modern day culture of the Navajo and Desert Southwest. However, I am now tired of Janet Pete & Jim Chee's non-relationship. I always feel very sad for Jim Chee because he's a good guy and he keeps going after the WRONG woman!"
3,"Worth Reading, But Not Hillerman's Best","As a long-time fan, I was eager to read the latest installment from Tony Hillerman. It's a good read, but not Hillerman's best work. I wish Hillerman would improve Lt. Chee's love life! Surely a character as bright and interesting as Lt. Chee could find someone to make him happy. I'm tired of Lt. Chee's on-going turmoil with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Janet Pete. I feel it's an annoying distraction from the storyline. Even writer Sue Grafton's character Kinsey Milhone finally found someone!"
2,Where was the editor?,"As a longtime Hillerman fan, there some things I expect in his books (vivid descriptions of a land the author clearly loves, gentle and often humorous evocations of Navajo culture, compelling characters) and some things I know better than to expect (an unpredictable plot, a graceful conclusion). With ""First Eagle,"" however, Hillerman managed to limbo under even my modest plot expectations, and he didn't have much to show me about Navajo culture in this yarn either. I won't hold it against him. I'll loyally read the next book, but I'm not so forgiving with the editor. All through ""First Eagle"" characters are surprised to discover something they were told two chapters back, and their short-term memories are clearly failing them when they recount events or conversations. It was a shoddy editing job if it can be called editing at all."
3,"After reading ""the Blessing Way"" I couldn't wait to read","another Hillerman novel. This was an interesting story, but didn't provide the typical ""Hillerman"" narrative about the traditions of the native Indians. But, if you're a true fan, you'll probably enjoy it and hope for another like the first."
3,Not The Best,"DISCLAIMER: I love Tony Hillerman. I've read every word he's published, but The First Eagle is not one of his best efforts. In the other Leaphorn/Chee novels, there are several plot lines that all converge. This story one had only one, despite attempting to bring Chee's old girlfriend back into the mix.I've learned a lot about the Navajo people from Tony, but learned nothing new in The First Eagle."
2,Hillerman needs to visit Northern Arizona,"Having been a resident of Flagstaff, and happening to live there when this book came out, I was sorely disappointed to read Hillerman's erroneous descriptions of the area. There is no bistro east of Flagstaff. The only thing east of Flagstaff before Winslow is the Winona Texaco and Meteor Crater and a lot of juniper bushes and dirt. And the route that Leaphorn and his lady friend, the ""professor,"" take from Cameron to Tuba City in one chapter is impossible to take because it does not exist! Any road atlas would confirm this.I now wonder how many of his other books have as many glaring errors as this one. This was a real letdown."
3,Vintage Hillerman. Chee and Leaphorn together again.,"Reading Hillerman is both a pleasurable and spiritual experience, and his new novel is no exception. Favorite characters, Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee join forces again. In the course of solving a new mystery, we learn about Indian lore, the beauty of the southwest desert and more. The fact that Hillerman's characters don't always win and succeed at everything makes them more believable and interesting. Leaves you anxiously waiting for the next adventure."
2,Coasting,"From most authors, this would be an impressive book. From Hillerman, it is not. He's coasting with this one -- worth reading, but don't buy it. I checked mine out of the library.Yes, it has Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, and it's set on the reservation. But the precipitating conflict is between two non-Native American researchers on the reservation. Leaphorn gets hired by one of the researcher's parents to solve her disappearance. Glimpses of Navajo culture and thinking, and Hopi culture, are here. But they are only glimpses, of what was fully laid out in exquisite and compassionate detail in Hillerman's previous books.As other reviewers note, this appears to be a ""rush"" book. I finished it in less than 24 hours after I picked it up. The hardback edition is 278 pages long, _but_ there are 31 lines per page, instead of the typical 40+ lines per page most hardbacks have. If you've heard great things about Hillerman, they're true -- but NOT in this book. Please start with one of his others."
2,Provides some entertainment but falls short.,"I read this book in college for Cultural Anthropology to study the cultural aspects and customs of Native American reservations and its citizens. The novel provided some insight on social standings and customs but in terms of entertainment it falls quite short, as it is quite predictable and not overly fulfilling.The writing is simply enough to provide the casual reader to breeze through chapters and the length of the novel is not overwhemling by any means."
4,Hillerman mystery series,"I've read all of Tony Hillerman's books, primarily for the mysteries, but also for the setting and the unique education he passes along about the Hopi and Navajo indians. This is a typical good mystery by Hillerman, but a little atypical as relates to his penchant for mysticism and indian culture; there is relatively little. His characters are continuing down their developmental paths, retirement, a starcrossed romantic relationship and an up and coming sleuth. Their development is center stage in this book, and provide a good read, but I was expecting the normal mix of indian lore, superstition, and hard desert living that you normally get from Hillerman.George E. Miller, author of The Lone War Cry"
2,What I always didn't wanted to know about Prairie Dogs.,"What happened? Have been devoted Hillerman fan since the very beginning. I didn't really want to take a course in mammal biology, I prefer the old Chee and Leaphorn. Also getting tired of Chee persuing Janet. This book goes on and on don't know if I'll ever finish it. Which is a shame. I usually indulge myself with a full day of reading."
2,To little too fast.,"I am sorry to say it but Hillerman tried to put something together with bits and pieces and they just don't hold together. Relationships are started, or restarted, and then the reader is given to little additional information to flesh out what the author is trying to convey. Where he realy missed the boat is not in developing the relationships between the Hopi and Navajo. Also much more about the Hopi and their culture would have made the book much more enjoyable."
2,Not up to par with past Chee and Leaphorn stories.,I felt a bit cheated. Details missing. A rather boring story. I'm hoping that the pressure put upon Mr. Hillerman by his fans to produce more and more Chee and Leaphorn will not result in more loss of quality. Chee must get on with his life and find someone else. Leaphorn deserves a lovelife and he and the new lady could become topnotch private investigators!
2,I eagerly anticipated this book and was disappointed.,"This book was not up to the standards I have come to expect in Tony Hillerman's Chee and Leaphorn series. The plot was convoluted and yet uninteresting and formulaic. Chee and Leaphorn in previous books had appealing personal characteristics. In this book, all the characters were ho-hum."
3,The continuing saga of crime on indian lands.,"Readers new to Hillerman will find his straightforward style an easy and satisfying read. He captures the feel of the southwest well, and his insights into Native American Indian cultures are moving. His characters are well crafted and have a true to life feel, and the story is fun. However, for those of us who have followed officer Chee and Lieutenant Leaphorn the book will disappoint. Their lives have not moved along. The book feels like a formula rehash, similar to Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series. Mr. Hillerman you can do better."
2,First Eagle,Dust jacket was badly discolored by the mailing method. No protection for the book provided in the paper mailing envelope.
2,"Good, but weak for Hillerman","I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries. My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one. I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up."
2,This book falls short of Hillerman's earlier works.,"Hillerman has written many great stories. This is not one of them. I love visualizing the landscape painted by Hillerman and the characters he develops with Longhorn and Chee. However he did not do either of these things with his usual adeptness. He appears to have written this one in a hurry. The details are lacking, the characters a re stagnant, and at one point dialog actually becomes confused. The First Eagle does not rate with HIllerman's earlier works. I will still anxioulsy await Hillerman's next release"
5,Played it constANTLY!,I loved this album so much. Humble Pie were one of the best of the British blues rock bandsThe song Desperation is one of my favorite songs still as is Safe as yesterday also. They were even better liveThis albums a jewelThey just dont have bands like this anymore or singers like Steve marriott..Humble Pie are incredibleBUY it!
5,Early Humble Pie .....Not so Humble,"For those Humble Pie fans, who started with Live at the Filmore or Rock On, As Safe as Yesterday Is, an Immediate release, is a great cd to revisit the evolution of the band. Great song writing, instrumentation, vocals, guitar, bass drums and occaissional organ. Great guitar hooks et all.Stick Shift, As Safe as Yesterday Is, Alabama 69, I'll Go Alone and A Nifty Little Number Like You are some of the highlights. Alabama 69 boasts an epilogue with sitar that is very cool but definitely not representational of the band, a rare track if you will. The talents of Steve Marriott, Jerry Shirley, Greg Riddley and Peter Frampton produced a lot of great music on this recording."
5,A True Classic,This is without a doubt one of the best classic rock albums of all times. Marriott and Frampton are trully at their best. The melodys just dont stop. The title cut is worth it alone. Buy it/Enjoy it
4,A book that sneaks up on you.,This book was not as good as the main rulebook. But then it depends on what you are looking for. History and factual information [when avaliable] is abundant. It covers alot of the book and is quite in deapth. That is worth 5 shuriken I mean stars ;). Which is a very interesting read.It adds alot of info for adding ninja into the game and some of it is very useful indeed. But by the end of the book. I felt that there should have been more game related info. But it is still worth your money. If you want to seriously add Ninja to your game then buy this book for sure.
4,I love this product,"It is exceptionally hard to write a review for a cosmetic product since everybody's skin is different. A tube of this product will last for a long time and the wash is gentle on skin. It over dries my face just a little bit, but it is not a problem."
4,Soothing cleanser,"Anthony Logistics makes a number of helpful personal care products and this is one of my favorites. It is a soothing facial cleanser that does what it claims - that is to clean your face with non abrasive cleaning ingredients and leave your face feeling soothed or moisturized afterward. After shaving your face with an electric razor, sometimes your skin is left feeling raw. This is one of the only products I have found which will clean the oils from your face while also soothing razor burn. Plus, it has a great slightly sweet smell. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin or has been suffering from razor burn."
3,Fame?,"To be honest this CD isn't half bad at all, however being an adult, I just can't see myself rocking to Lil...ahem...Bow Wow and he is years younger than myself. But for the younger crowd maybe 15-19, I'd say a good choice. I didn't really like Shortie Like Mine, the song was rather boring."
3,I like it but the edit has to go!,"The CD is overall really good but its edited!!! His last album ""Wanted"" isn't edited at all he says ""N****"" plenty of times but on this every bloody word that is ""innapropriate"" is gone... Even Da*n... CMON!! UR MATURE NOW BOW WOW time to make an Explicit CD!!!"
1,"Can't Sing, Can't Rap, Little sissy","Bow Wow, he can't sing, he can't rap, and personally I never thought he could. He tries to act hard, but a little girl could probably knock him out. Like I said in my review on Chris Brown, if you're looking for good music, look past this because you're not going to find any here."
5,Awesome of course! Best Band!,The Cure is a great a great band. This is a remix of some of the their good songs.
5,A classic by The Cure,"I love this album. I am a big fan of the cure, and this album is pretty much a 'best of' album, but remixed. I really like the version of 'caterpillar' and 'hot hot hot'."
3,Great Album! Great Cover! Needs Major Remastering though!,"This is one of my favourite albums and I've had it for years except that the sound quality needs to be remastered as the volume levels are low and given what's out there today, the sound quality is not acceptable for an otherwise brilliant cd. Not only is the cover design fantastic the track selections are brilliant and it's a very cohesive album as each track seems to flow naturally one after the other. It has everything you'd want in a great album and so if they could keep everything but improve the sound quality and release it in a mini-lp cardboard replica sleeve, this would be a great buy. I know I'll pre-order it in a flash!"
4,Very good dance remix album from a band!,"I thought that this remix album was a good release to put out in that 3-year period while The Cure were working on songs for their 1992 album Wish. To follow the great Disintegration from 1989 was very tough, so this '90 album has some very solid remixes. For a rock band to make a remix album is a rarity. Songs like Hot,Hot, Hot, Fascination Street, and Lullaby have some very addictive, catchy remixes. They keep your attention for 7 to 9 minutes of their individual songs. Most songs keep the similar dance beats per minute to match with the band's sound. I love A Forest's remix, given that it is one of their earlier songs. Makes you feel like you're in a forest when you listen to the song. This was a strong album in its own right and kudos to the many remixers who made these songs."
3,thunder!,"i adore the remix of hothothot!!!, crashing and so energetic it loses all ironythe other mixes are good...but something in me craves pictures of you minus the new beat..."
3,"good, not great","these are nice enough mixes, but when ""a forest"" and ""the walk"" are the best on the CD, you know something is up. But you get the extended version of ""never enough"" which is kick butt enough to make up for just about anything."
5,Bloopers Bleeps Blodyslams,"i bought this tape a long while back and have thoroughly enjoyed it.off the top of my head i can think of Freddie Blassie giving his advice on love, telling a woman maybe she should shave her armpits... then Kamala eats a chicken, and the Iron Sheik's camel. there is a lot more on here that i cannot think of right now but I honestlyl believe if you buy this tape you will not be disappointed!"
1,BORING,"I'm a voracious reader and suck up any read I can get my hands on, THIS I could not even get into for free. SO SORRY I TRIED."
5,Love to read,"WOW! What a story, I almost didn't read the whole book, now I'm glad I did. I'm not into war and history stories, but I hate to start a story and not finish it.This is one of the best books I've read.be ready for a lot of emotion in this story.The first part of this story was a little slow. but then I couldn't put it down.It is nice to know there are people in this world like that. I even read the last 50 pages twice. Give this story a try. It made my day, and made me think of a better world."
2,Dracula's curse,"What can I say about this film? The characters simply do not have any personality. And to be honest, I just don't like any movie that only has an absolute evil, an absolute good and nothing in bwteen. It is a good movie if you just want to know the plot, but then why not just watch the 1992 version of Dracula. The only reason I give it 2 star is because the story is pretty close to the original novel."
2,It was OK,"This is just a low budget or cheapie version of the 1991 version of the Dracula Movie. Stays along the old story line except this is in modern times but no surprises here. The acting was rated about the same as the old HAMMER actors were which wasn't that great, but you could always rely on Lee and Cushing to pull the movie thru. The only thing that kept me watching this movie was the girl that played Lucy. (she was a hottie)"
3,I've seen better....,"True this adaptation does keep true to the general story from Bram Stoker, however, it is set in the present day, which to me, takes away from some of the appeal of the original story. The acting is so-so. It's not bad, but it's not great either.I prefer the Bram Stoker Dracula starring Winona Ryder & Gary Oldman.If you are a collector of the vampire movie genre, then this is a good addition."
2,Not Just Dracula's Curse If You Buy This...,"Patrick Bergen plays Dracula, that should have been enough of a warning. Basically, its the same story that you have seen a bajillion times, set in contemporary Budapest.The production values are low, the special effects are boring, the sound is bad and so is the acting. Very little blood is spilled so there is nothing here for gore fans. I'm giving this muck 2 stars because I think it was an honest attempt at making a movie."
3,Not what I had expected....,"Rented this for a Saturday nite chiller thriller. I realize this was a tvmovie from Europe with a limited budget but putting a modern spin onthis classic tale didn't have much bite. I couldn't get past the waythese actors came across, felt like they were reading their scripts toeach other. There really wasn't much in the scare dept. a few good setshere and there doesn't make a good film and this one fell short in everyway. Three stars is more than it deserves."
3,too much facial hair to be dracula,The storyline isn't that bad but the acting is way off. Most of the actors are unknown and act in weird ways. Their wide variety of foreign accents make it seem like a british film or 60s italian film with english voice over. That blonde actress seems to speak proper english but the rhythm at which she speaks changes many times within a sentence. The dracula character is played by a bearded british guy which isn't consistant with the ancient slavic count that he's suppose to be. The combination of these factors make it a hilarious movie to watch.
5,Loki Ragnarok - This is second season where the first,I love loki ragnarok....if you watch the anime this manga will make more sense.....I didn't understand why adv translated the second season manga and not the first.
3,Unrealized Potential,"'Imposter' is a story that had the potential to be very good, but it didn't quite work out.The story focuses on Matt Kelly who is a rookie federal agent. He is walking up to his mother's house with her when she is killed by an explosion at the front door. He then has his father (a U.S. senate candidate) pull some strings to help him be able to investigate the case.There are several parts of the story that are mentioned but just left hanging with no real explanation ever given. Some of these are as follows: Matt and his father having a strained relationship, Matt being emotionally disconnected from virtually the entire human race, Matt having moved around a lot as a child. There are others too.Some parts of the story were quite action packed and kept my interest. Overall though, this was just average."
3,First Bunn book,I have to say I really enjoyed this book although the story was a bit confusing at times. If I had to be tested on it after I finished I'm not sure my grade would be very good. The main character Matt was touted as being this super guy but ended up with more flaws then interstates of St. Louis. (If you've ever been there you know what I mean.) I would have liked for the romance to be left out or seriously downplayed although it was helpful in seeing the growth of the characters. There are plenty of romance books on the shelf so there was really no need for it. If you're looking for Christian fiction you won't find much here but it is clean enough for your teenagers to read. I'll try reading more by this author since I can't judge by one book. If you get it on sale you won't be disappointed.1 Star = I've been robbed!2 Stars = Why'd I finish it?3 Stars = Good4 Stars = Excellent5 Stars = Life changing
2,LeBra Font End Cover,"First one received was damaged in shipping. It cost us $18.00 to return it, we got back $8.95 and we have AMAZON PRIME! Second one arrived in good shape but doesn't fit correctly. We're only using the lower half because the top flaps too much. The license plate cut out didn't fit on the lower half so we had to have an upholstery shop cut and stitch it. Overall not very pleased with this product.Covercraft LeBra Custom Fit Front End Cover for Toyota Camry - (Vinyl, Black)"
5,Must have!,"I wasn't sure at first, but after listening a dozen times, there's more subtle detail than I realized at first, both from Jaco himself and the collection of phenomenal musicians he got to collaborate with him. The bonus tracks are really great too - not just some ""junk"" they added to make it look good.It's rare to find a CD with this much musical sense, and you can ""hear"" the musicians listening to one another and framing each other.One of the best CDs I own."
5,Jaco was an origional,"My first intro. to Jaco was on Weather Report's ""Heavy Weather"". I later heard ""Jaco Pastorious"" in college (about 1980). He was truly amazing, as you've read in the other reviews. As I recall, Jaco was also known (by few besides his peers) as an excellent piano player. This album is not for everyone. You must be prepared for intense listening. It almost seems like Jaco wanted to show the world all his amazing tricks on one recording. A worthy part of any serious collection of contemporary fusion jazz."
5,Jaco Pastrious OH NO!!!!!!!!,"Jaco is cool. Come on Come Over is tight! when i heard that, I said this guy kicks ass. The whole album rocks too. Get it It rules. But when you try to play it on an instrument, you get, OH NO!!!!!"
5,Jaco the genius,"When i first got interested in bass, I started reading about Jaco Pastorius and I really wanted this album.Finally, I had the oppurtunity to buy it and I absolutely loved it! I usually listen to rock, brit rock mostly, but I really enjoyed this record. Jaco Pastorius is definetly the best bassist EVER!"
2,Extremely poor.,"The audio quality of the tapes is very poor (it was recorded for foreign service training in the 50's). They do not help you with pronounciation, verb tenses, or word order, and the speaking is very quick and cut-off. The whole course is thousands of phrases written in both english and german in the book, and dictated in german on the tapes so you can follow along. Unless you can memorize sounds instantly, you will constantly be rewinding and relistening to the tapes. I found this to be a waste of money and regret purchasing it."
3,Maybe it Will Grow on Me,"I like Tim -- his styel is sincere and open-faced, and I expected to love this album after listening to him sing the title track Here I Am To Worship at my local Christian bookstore, but I was somewhat dissapointed. The arrangements and melodies are good and his voice is exceptional, but the lyrics didn't draw me into worship like I expected. I was hoping for something inspired and original, but these songs -- with a few exceptions -- sound like trite phrases stitched together. I'm not trying to be mean. I think he could be a really great songwriter with someone experienced to mentor him, and with two CD's after this one already recorded, maybe that's already happened for him. I wish him all the best and appreciate this first endevour. God bless."
5,"heavy, british, great music!","miocene are a great young band from the UK! 'refining the theory' was their 1st mini album containing 6 tracks lasting about 60 minutes! they have just released a new e.p. 'cellular memory', which is a lot different to this album! very trippy kinda dj shadow like (dj shadow helps out on one song) and it is also excellent! anyway download 'fits like that' and if you are a metal fan there is no way in hell you wont like that song! i have seen them twice live at newcastle uni. and they kicked [***] both times! everyone one keeps describing them as a mix between tool and the deftones, i dont think that is correct they have their own sound (especially after the release of the new e.p.) but how can they be bad if they are compared to them two bands!??! you ain't gonna get no limp bizkit from this!"
3,Clarification,There were two bands called Acumen in the mid-90's. The industrial band called Acumen changed their name to Acumen Nation in 1998 to avoid a conflict. This cd is by the band that kept the name. I have no idea what they sound like. I'm a fan of the Nation. :)Just wanted to clear up any possible confusion.
1,As diverse as an aural nightmare.,"I won't waste your time with a lengthy review here, and certainly don't waste your money buying this CD. Acumen sounds like Rush meets the Grateful Dead. If that sounds really good to you, then by all means support this middling music. Otherwise, take that fifteen dollars and purchase something worthwhile."
4,Natalie Cole,This has 22 selections including Unforgettable as the 22nd song. This is the beautiful duet of Natalie with her Dad that was done with special electronics. CD includes songs such as The very thought of You and Our love is here to Stay. Wonderful dinner music or set the mood for the evening. Great music selection.
1,Worst Module Ever,"I have recently been filling in some gaps in my classic module collection.This one really is not worth owning. Bad plot, stupid encounters and bizarre text. The PC characters provided (who you really have to use since the entire module is coded around them) have great names like Blondie, Slim and Blaze. There is boxed dialogue where NPCs say things like, 'Gee Whiz.' and 'Golly.'I have nearly all the classic modules and this one is one of the worst. If you are looking to complete your own collection, save this one til last!"
5,Great book,I have read the Cranberry series of books to several elementary classes for the psat 12 years. The books always hold the attention of the students. A bonus is the recipe at the end.
1,Important part does not work,"I bought this item to check live wires, correct plug wiring and such. The crimper is a very cheap tool, best avoided. The widget to check correct plug wiring works. The tool to indicate live wires does not work.Overall, not worth the money. At full price, its a joke. I would not pay more than $5 for it, considering that only one of the four items is any good."
2,A tribute to a lengendary band,"It's the seconde official tribute to iron maiden and it's less good than the first; the choice of music it's worse because they are always in the same musical style, almost the works of bands who give the tribute is just a works of copy even if it's symphatic to listen them, there is an air of deja-vu. For a fan it's just an album to add in your collection..."
5,Dance Fever,If you want to dance and move this is the cd for you...comming striaght out of O- Town Florida...it will build you up and drop you down only to start all over again. When it is done you will only want to start it over!!
5,"To coin a phrase,","""after further review""....years and years later I re-visit this 1990 Anita Baker release to conclude that this indeed may be her best. I bought into Anita with The Songstress, the release prior to her classic Rapture. Obviously she took off after that, and to buy Anita was like putting your hand inside a glove, it felt good, and it was comfortable. She was never gonna top Rapture was she? I mean cmon. That was my mindset anyway. I just didn't give Compositions enough air time, I may even have been dismissive, admitedly, but again, it was comfortable to have in my collection. Having just recently gone back to it, and with a critical listen, I conclude it's stellar from start to finish. Pound for pound, at best I consider it to be head and shoulders over Rapture, IMO. At the very least?......It's as good as. If you've tuned this one out, tune it back in, you'll be pleasantly rewarded."
5,SASSY ANITA,"I miss Anita, too. My taste in music may be as diverse as many others. I love everything from Bonnie Raite, Jill Scott, to Sarah Vaughn. If she dose start recording again, will her music be as memorable? I don't know if Anita really knows how her music is appreciated.I loved this cd and everything on it."
4,baker's compositions are timeless.,"on this, her fourth album, anita baker continues to give us the best that she's got. though _compositions_ contains fewer breakaway masterpieces, baker's songwriting and vocals are as flawless as ever. acheiving popularity during the height of 1980s fascination with quiet storm, baker remains a much-respected fixture in the music industry, and is almost single-handedly responsible for perserving rhythm and blues in its truest form. the fact that baker is actually in the studio with the musicians, coupled with the powerhouse back-up vocals of perrí, make for extraordinary listening. baker's songs speak of love in a way that is far too seldomly done, nowadays. ""fairy tales"" the album's crowning glory, though dealing with the pain of heartbreak, takes us back to a time when love invoked romance before sex. baker's voice is at it's best as it soars and sails over the metaphorical lyrics, making the listener hungry, already, for her next release."
1,Boring and devoid of content,"On the back of the dvd it reads: ""Credo: A movie on John Paul II - His Life.""First of all, this is not a movie, and does not say anything about his life. This is just one hour of footage from his funeral, intermixed with 5-10 second clips from his visits to places around the world - mostly just him waving his arm hello, or reciting prayers or giving speeches.It is not presented chronologically, there is no story line or narrative, and it would not help you understand who is was, what he stood for, and what he even did with his time on this earth, except for be the pope, wave to an audience and give a few speeches.Not a movie but a video scrapbook. May be interesting for people not interested in learning about him, but simply watching him, dead and alive."
3,As good as new,"The BMW drink holder is worthless, but this product is an exact replacement. Aesthetically, identical, but functions just as poorly."
1,purchased,"the seller did a great job but the design itself is flawed, the reason people pay to get them replaced. I purchased this a while back and it has broken just like the original. do your self a favor buy it, then never use it unless it is a can of soda and even then use it with great care. Very easy install once you have the old one out! SAME OEM quality sadly. Gave this a 1star because it broke again on me."
1,"""Still Dead"" - Not Good","I loved the first ""Book of the Dead"". It had some great stories in it. This second installment, though, just was lacking. I just had the feeling that this book got all the stories that weren't quite good enough for the first one. Unfortunately, they wouldn't be good enough for a third, fourth, fifth, etc., book either. If you want some good zombie stories go to the Home Page of the Dead site and check out the fan fiction section. Oh, there's quite a few stinkers there as well but there's also, in my opionion, even more that show some real artistic quality. Definitely quite a few that are better than anything in this book."
1,dull and dull--save your money,"The original, ""The Book of the Dead"", to which this is a sequel, is much better simply because at least 2 stories somewhat approach what most of us want in survival horror. I won't repeat what I wrote there (feel free to check out my review), but this book isn't worth the time or money. The stories are far too cutesy, as though, in trying to present new perspectives, every writer drew from the same cliched examples.Nothing here as cool as the terrific ending to Resident Evil (the movie), the tunnel scenes in The Stand, or the Manhattan scenes in Swan Song--and the last 2 aren't even zombie stories! A better book--though much harder to find--might be Bryan Keene's The Rising.Certainly a much scarier book is Noel Hynd's Ghosts.Avoid these 2 books--The Book of the Dead and Still Dead. Not only are they not scary--they're dull!"
2,Needs a Little More,"This book did a great job of covering the pure factual information regarding the failure of the IMF. However, its main weak point comes in the fact that, despite recounting the events surrounding the Asian crisis, it does not contain enough information that is new and never-before told. When I read a book on world economic issues, I expect to learn a variety of new opinions and little-known facts, and Blustein did not do enough of this. The book was not an eye-opener to the workings of the IMF, and this was a huge dissapointment as far as I am concerned. I actually fell asleep midway through due to the monontonous meanderings of Blustein's antics, and I would suggest getting it out of the library before even considering adding it to your collection. I really expected more from it, and was struck by just how uninspiring it was."
3,Okay,"Overall, this is a decent presentation of the issues presented by the Asian and Russian financial crises, but the analysis has a lot of problems. It does a great job of criticizing without presenting real alternatives. A lot of smart people made a decision; they knew there were risks, they knew alternative ideas existed but they had to pick ONE approach to try. They didn't pick the perfect one. All this book really says is that a relatively smart guy with hindsight is better than a group of geniuses who have to make a decision with imperfect information. Interesting info, but please don't base your opinion of the IMF on this guy. (I don't work at the IMF)"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I bought the TENS Clean-Cote Protective Wipes believing them to have some sort of protective coating on them for skin that is sensitive to the electrode pads. What did I get? A box of 50 alcohol wipes that I can get for nothing from my sister who is a nurse. This is blatant misrepresentation of goods. I am a frequent customer on Amazon and like to think that when I buy from an Amazon seller, I am getting what is advertised. I am outraged that BalegoOnline.org so openly rips off people with disabilities. Unfortunately, I opened a packet before reading the ingredients which, I guess, nullifies a return. $10.50 is a heck of a lot of money to pay for alcohol wipes. I can buy a huge bottle of rubbing alcohol for $2. at Walmart. Don't waste your money- I hope Amazon does something about this seller."
5,Works Great!,My Doctor gave me a free sample of this stuff and I loved it so much I bought 2 boxes. This stuff makes your skin really sticky so that the tens unit leads stay in place.
2,Misleading Nutrition Label,"Sure they taste great, but the nutrtion label is misleading. It says only 50 calories and 13 grams of sugar, but that is PER SERVING and there are 2.5 servings per bottle. That makes it 125 calories and 32.5 grams of sugar, which is almost as bad as regular soda. Just make sure you know what you are swallow if you are counting carbs or calories. You might be better off taking a vitamin and drink diet soda or flavored water."
5,A Resource for Real Life!,"This is a powerful book. I use it daily as a resource. I recently attended the author's ""Start Your Own Part-Time Business"" workshop, with the intention of opening my own business. I am now further along that path, and everything we did in the workshop helped me get to where I am now. I keep going back to Karen's book and I use the workshop materials all of the time."
1,buy something different,"These jacks are sold at your local ""discount"" auto parts stores like autozone etc. These jacks work for about 3 uses and they then fail to lift because the seals are bypassing the fluid. If you contact the manufacturer (Larin) about getting a rebuild kit, you get NO response. Buy a jack with a better name like craftsman."
1,Won't hold pressure,"This jack didn't maintain a lift right out of the box unless it was cranked very tight (not easy with the crappy grip and impossible with greasy hands). Eventually, it has become completely useless and will not even lift the pad much less a car. I'm searching for warranty info."
5,Very good,"I ordered replacement filters (only needed one, but they come in a set of two). It came pretty quickly, and was exactly what I ordered."
4,Great shoes!,"Just received them, delivered on time and they fit perfectly out of the box! I can't wait to try them out while shopping and especially the wash and wear part! These will be a great addition to my travel shoes!"
5,Very Comfortable,These are most comfortable walking shoes I've owned. They are very durable and wash well. I have both a black and white pair. I will continue to purchase them as long as they are made.
5,good traveling shoes,"I have this shoe in two other colors, and I like it a lot. It fits well, and is a great shoe for travel. It is light in weight, and easy to get on and off at airport security. I bought this pair for a trip to Baltimore."
2,Tight fit,"Liked the looks and washability of these shoes, but they were too hard to get on especially with socks. I have these in a slide and love them, but these were not comfortable."
2,Runs small,"I ordered my usual size, and these shoes were too small. I did not order a larger size because the width was fine - the length was not - and I did not want a larger, loose shoe. I also expected more of a cushioned feeling based on the other reviews. These were very firm, and I did not think they would be comfortable for a full day of walking on cement floors."
5,Awesome shoes,These shoes are wide enough for my foot and also can hold my sole inserts easily and still fit well. They are easy to slip in to and out of without having to use your hands to assist. Love them!
3,Big sizing was unexpected,"really lightweight, but actually bigger than I expected (surprising for an 8EE) - it was loose on my foot, which never happens. Big bad: they gave me blisters on the back of my ankle (where the top back of the shoe rubs). I think they'll be ok with really thick socks - fine in the winter but useless in the summer!"
2,NO NO!!!,I thought this style would be comfortable....looks are deceiving. It felt like I was wearing a Plastic shoe. It made my toes pull together...the heel area is high and rubber my tendon. No comfort here!!
5,Very comfortable and good looking,"I have MS and it is difficult for me to put my shoes on. It is not easy for me to find a good-looking comfortable shoe. These shoes fit like a glove, even with socks on. I love them."
5,Great Shoe,This is a great shoe - good enough that I bought two more pairs. It is lightweight and very comfortable
3,Propet Women's Wash & Wear Slip-Ons,"As I never received my ""Propet Women's Wash & Wear Slip-On"" shoes, my imagination must invent the memories of joy I never experienced upon slipping my feet into these comfortable shoes -- an event that actually would have happened had these shoes been delivered as I had instructed the delivery service. Amazon is great, but some of the knucklehead vendors they work with are impossible to do business with. I am happy that as soon as I alerted Amazon.com to the problem, Amazon.com promptly acted to refund me."
3,average,This is a nice slip-pn shoe thats washable. The arch for me was not quite in the right place and took some getting used to. Not an all-day shoe for me.
4,Hot Foot it to these shoes,"It is most irritating to me that my feet get burning hot, so without even thinking about it, I kick off my shoes. That is a major annoyance when I need to put them back on again and have to tie them each time.In order to solve this, I looked for shoes to slip on, and at first, I tried walkers with velcro fasteners. I kept the velcro loose so that my foot would slip in and out. This was fine, and the shoes are comfortable, but their quality is poor.Then I found these shoes, which are the best solution so far. They are comfortable, and they have an elasticized collar that hugs the ankle with no irritation caused by seams or edges. Also, this collar doesn't fold and crush like leather tends to do. The shoes are also a moderate price.My only complaint is that the insert is cheap and tends to slip around, and I had to replace it right away with a Dr. Scholl's insert."
3,Perhaps for non-problem feet - not for mine.,"I'll readily admit that I've had three foot surgeries (plantar fascitis and to give me a new achilles tendon - thanks much to UCLA Santa Monica!)I'd heard and read that Propet shoes are ""da bomb"" so to speak and so good for your feet. This particular style doesn't have the support that I need - was told I should have ordered the ""Mary Janes"" instead. I've never ordered any shoes via online or via a catalog - and probably won't again. I would return them but my husband threw away the box and invoice.They are not uncomfortable - just don't fit my feet correctly - I'm going to try a couple of thick insoles - and see if any improvement."
4,Comfortable But Plastic Looking,"Very comfortable but they look a bit too ""old lady/plastic"" for me. However, I like the fit and they are good walking shoes. Though I wear a medium width shoe this shoe is slightly more narrow than other medium width shoes I've had in the past. I do like that they are machine washable though I haven't needed to do that yet."
5,Walking Show,"Best walking shoe ever, this is my third pair and will continue to buy them. Comfortable and easy on the back"
2,These shoes are not what they are bragged up to be!!!,"My wife had her right hip and knee replaced so she spent a lot of time researching for the best shoe to aide in her recovery. These shoes were touted as the best. As soon as she put them on she had to remove them. They were extremely uncomfortable.They have no arch support what so ever. And before she put them on we both commented on how poorly they were constructed. Also the size was way off. We think they sent men's size rather than woman's.One of our criteria for buying anything is made in the USA. Before we ordered these shoes I asked if they were American made. I was informed that they were made in Canada. Of course, we trust the craftsmanship of our neighbors from the north. However, the label inside this shoe states that they are made in China!!!I feel bad to have to write a negative report but I don't want you to be disappointed if you purchase them."
2,"Too Ugly, Too Constricting","As an avid gardener and also a fan of Propet shoes which offer sizes in Wide width, I was looking forward to the wash and wear feature. However, just one look right out of the box and the constricting feel in putting them on, I immediately repacked and returned them."
5,excellent,i was so pleased with these sneakers. they are so comfortable. i will only buy this brand from now on!
2,Very disappointed,"I was so excited about this shoe from all the good reviews. But when I got it, not only did I realize the shoe ran REALLY big - it wouldn't even stay on my foot! - but it also had a very ""plastic"" look to it. Honestly, it just looked really cheap and very old fashioned for this 35 year old :-) I could never give prophet 1 star because honestly, they have a lot of great shoes, but this just wasn't one of them."
3,Not what I really needed.,"I ordered these shoes thinking they would be cushiony and soft. They were not suited for me with my high arch. I found them to be very light weight which was a plus, but uncomfortable after standing in them for the last half of my shift. I have arthritis and gout in my feet and was just looking for something with more cushioning in them."
2,Too long,"I returned these shoes. They were way too long in the toe and the heel slipped in my regular size. Not what I expected, but they are a nice looking shoe."
2,Confusing Sizes,"I ordered these for a friend, who picked out the particular size. The sizing options listed were a bit confusing, and of course the ones she received were too long despite being her usual size. She is returning them, not trying to exchange for another pair."
3,Disappointed,"I ordered these shoes because my feet have been swollen lately and the wide EE shoes I usually wear are a little too tight. I ordered the EEEE size and I had to struggle to even get my foot into the shoe. It was so tight and painful I had to take it right off. If it didn't have such a narrow opening they may have worked for me. If you are looking for just wide shoes, these would probably work, but if you buy wide shoes because of swelling, they might not work."
4,Mostly a great shoe,"This is my second pair of these shoes. They wash in the laundry, keep my feet warm in the winter, and are easy to slip on to walk the dog. They hold up well. The reason they didn't get 5 stars is because this pair has a rough spot on the inside of the shoe at the heel that is rubbing a little. Didn't have this problem before. Hoping it wears down."
3,Propet walking shoe,The shoe is easy to slip on and off. The quality of the shoe molding is good. True to size. It will last a long time.The back of the shoe is low on the heal which pulls down at mid heel and it lacks a true arch support. I had to add an arch support insert which helps. Overall the shoe is good quality but the price should be lower. I've had better for cheaper.
3,Not for me,The shoe did not fit me properly - I have narrow heels and wide at the ball of my foot. These shoes were boxy and my heel slid out of them easily. They were comfortable and good looking and easy to slip on so if you need a shoe that is this style I would recommend it.
3,Good Information but not great,The book has a value for about 100 pages. Then the author ran out of viable insights.
4,Great for management and decision making,"Great management book from a Drucker standpoint. I respect Mr. Adizes work. This is a very good book. Just really goes into the cancers that bring down organizations. He helps you identify when this happens. Really explains the Cycle of companies. You will be able to identify the weakness's and strength of your company very quickly.This book speaks tremendous wisdom and experience. If you would like to change your corporate culture, this book is for you. Flows very well."
4,Smell great,"For years, I have looking for popcorn seasonings in the supermarkets and have no luck. Glad to find it in Amazon but it didn't list how much sodium it contains. Contacted the seller and received unclear answers. Ordered two of each four different seasonings because of high shipping cost. I find this seasoning too sweety so you might want to watch it out if you have weight issues. The taste is both equally mix of apple and cinnamon."
4,Vent Elbow,Dryer vent elbow helps to conserve space in small areas. Was able to move Dryer closer to the wall without crimping flexible venting hose.
3,Good but...,"Sound wise, these are an awesome upgrade from the ipod head phones. Unless you're an audiophile, you won't complain about the sound. Especially if you listen to music with a significant amount of bass. Looks good, adequate cord length for working out.Here's why only 3/5. I like the headphones; however, I got my pair early-mid March and they died within 2 weeks of use. First the right ear went, then the left ear too. I'm not sure if it was a lemon or if vibes consistently have this problem. I don't blast my music, so I'm not sure what happened. I sent them in for replacement and they processed it VERY FAST, so don't be worried if you need to do that. I just feel like customer's shouldn't have to do that. Again, maybe there's a problem with vibes. Makes me wonder if I should have gotten some Ultimate Ears, Shures, Senn, etc."
3,"Sound is very good, sound transfer from rubbing is very bad","As long as you can wear these so the cords do not rub against your clothes, they are great!Even sitting at a desk all day listing to music, the transfer of noise from rubbing against my shirt can be very annoying. It got to the point to where I am now using a different set. (Vmoda Bass Freq)The other issue I have never had with ear buds is getting a shock in the ear. At work where we have carpeted floors there can be times where I get a good static shock. This also happened at home while petting my dog.The sound & fit are great, but I have found the noise from rubbing against my shirt or whatever (and the shocks) are just to annoying & have gone back to my Vmoda Bass Freq. I will still use these at home, but that is not where I do most of my ear bud usage. (And the Bass Freq are 1/2 the price!)If it was not for these 2 issues, this would be a 5 star review."
3,"Good sound, breaks as easily as the rest, cruel leather case","I bought these to replace Sony MDR-EX71 earbuds. They were a little over my budget, but the sound is good, so I was fairly happy. Unfortunately, I'm on the second pair where the small connection between the earbud and the cable has come loose, exposing bare wire. The left earbud now has less volume than the right, and it's only a matter of time before it loses sound completely. Disappointing durability.Also disappointing is the inclusion of animal hide as a trendy, fashionable, and cruelly unnecessary carrying case accessory."
2,"Decent sound, lousy durability","I use these with an iPod, and pocket them rarely. I actually use them the most when using my home treadmill or walking the dog. Besides that I've used them on only two trips.They've developed a short and the sound intermittently goes in and out. Very annoying. They sure look flashy... oh and on that the blue finish has worn down considerably. Also the metal jacket that covers the male plug (the thing you stick into your iPod/whatever) came loose and slides up and down the earbud cable! Wow! Yes they are cheap!On the sound, not too shabby I guess. I use a cheap pair of Grados for most day to day listening. They seem really more balanced for drum and bass, and hip hop. Not really my main stay.I bought these on a whim, at Costco, right before a trip to South America. I recommend if you have the time shop around a bit more."
3,"I raved out these buds, now forget out it!","When I first got these buds I was instantly hooked, the bass and sounds were top notch amazing. Showed them off to coworkers and everything. A couple of months later, one side is cutting off, then the other side, and then both both sides are cuttng off unless I'm holding the wire down right. Overall, great quality sound for a very limited time! What a shame."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I got the newest version from amazon on April 6, 2009. Now, three months later after light use (walking) the left ear goes out. Now I have to return them and they make you pay for the shipping cost. WTF VMODA? The sound quality was good and they were comfortable but they really are not worth 50 dollars. Save your money and buy a proper set of earbuds. This is the worst item I have ever bought online and the company return policy stinks. They know that these break a lot yet they make you pay for the shipping. I emailed them before I bought these asking if the quality was better then the reviews made me believe. They told me that their engineers fixed the problem and that they would work for more then a year. Well here I am with a pair of useless earbuds that cost me 50 dollars and only worked for 3 months. Please, dont buy these unless you feel like returning them every three months."
2,Second pair of these earbuds to die after two months.,"I bought a set of these V Moda ear buds as a gift in April. By June, one ear was not working. Thought maybe this was a fluke, but subsequently bought another set for someone else as a gift in June, and now by July, the same thing has happened. As I bought both sets from Amazon, am unsure about warranty situation. Will suggest these to anyone."
2,"Light use, already shorting out","Bought them in Sep 08 and with light use (2x a week at most) the left ear just died.Luckily it falls under warranty, but it's a hassle I thought I was avoiding by buying a ""premium"" product."
4,"Exelent sound, but one porblem","Superb sound quality, great design, and, conquering the biggest problem most people have with earbuds, they stay in your ears! Although, after about a month of being amazed with the clarity and power of the earbuds i did encounter a problem with the wiring that connects to the jack; the left earbud suddenly stopped working so now i have to angle the wire just right so the left bud will work, but it's worth it!"
1,Stay Away! Broke After 6 Months,"Despite being careful with these headphones with my iPod, the wire insulation and then the wire separated at BOTH the plug-in end and at one of the earbuds, and they stopped working in SIX MONTHS. I have owned other headphones for YEARS. These are junk."
2,"Good bass, easily broken","After 3 months the right bud was no longer working, then after a few more months the left side broke.They are inexpensive for the sound, but what is the point if you have to replace them so often?"
2,Great Sound BUT Poor Durability,Rich highs and deep lows sound great BUT NOT IF THE CABLES FALL OUT Of THE BUDS AFTER 3 WEEKS of routine use!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh
1,Epidemic lack of quality please read the reviews before buying!!,These headphones look great and sound quality is great. But mine lost sound in the left ear after 2 weeks! That is completely unacceptable. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. Apparently this happens with great frequency. Save $50 and much aggravation and check out the Sony Fontopia's. Those lasted me a year which prior to this was dissapointing. I spent the extra money for increased durability and was completely wrong. You don't get what you pay for. Avoid V-Moda like the plague!
2,quality is horrible,"These headphones are horribily constructed. My first set stop working after 3 or 4 months under very minimal travel and normal use I use it when I'm on the computer,so not once did it get tugged off my ear. The sound just stop coming. Im on my second pair through vmoda warrianty and the left buds stopped working, in two days time- what the hell.Some says they sound good- but they never say compare to what, iPod headphones. Well sure it sounds good in that case. To me the bass was rich almost overpowering good for some not for all. I bought the shure se210 on amazon for 110 plus shipping. These feel so much more durable and sounds much more balanced. If your a bass person and you have an iPod use the equilzers. They work fine. These vmoda feels like an expensive overpriced toy-wait it is."
5,Truly Amazing Sound,"Listen, I see a lot of earphones/earbuds that are $100 and beyond. I never imagined myself spending that kind of money because I was happy with the Sony EX51's that I got at Amazon for my iPod. I decided to take the plunge and get the Vibe's vice the Bose because they are smaller and more concealed in the ear. Wow! What a difference! These headphones are nothing short of impressive. The only difference from the Vibe's to the Vibe 2's is better build quality but that is only for the sets with a rubber coating around the cable, not the mesh that the silver one's have.If you want to plunk down a hundred dollars and get something that you will be happy with, this is the product. It came with a case and 3 sets of buds in black and 3 in clearish-white. What a deal!Word to the wise: If you get the original Vibe's for sale on Amazon and they are a set without the rubber coating and have the mesh coating, save the extra $ and get them. They are essentially the same."
1,I replaced this product 4 times,I have replaced this product 4 times in one year. It is only a matter of time before one speaker stops working. This product looks and works great when it works but the quality is the worst I have ever seen. It starts shorting at the connection point to your device within 2-3 months of purchase. I do not recommned this product to anyone.The company must know about it but they have not made any attempts to fix their problem.
2,"Great sound and look, Badly designed audio jack","If you are looking to buy these go with the Vibe II's. The original Vibe's have had the audio pickup jacket redesigned 3 times because of failure. I have had mine replaced twice under warranty, they broke again but I am out of warranty. Vmoda knows this is a design flow, just google it. Again, forgo these older models, THEY WILL BREAK."
3,Wonderful Sound / Poor Durability,"Bought one pair for my wife's iPhone and we liked it so much bought a second pair for me. After about 4-6 weeks of use, both pairs failed, the symptom being one earbud stopped producing sound. For awhile, you could jiggle the wire near the plug and reestablish the sound. This ""workaround"" eventually stopped working too. V-Moda seems good about replacing the defective earbuds. We currently have both sets on the replacement journey. Based on their shipping, the entire process takes about 2 weeks from when you ship the defective earbuds back to them (you pay the return costs). Hopefully they have found the weak link and the replacement earbuds will last."
2,Faulty,I bought these because of the positive reviews. It took only 2-3 months for the left one to fry. I only used them in the Aviom our church orchestra uses for sound. I was very surprised when they bit the dust. I certainly won't buy any more.
4,Great headphones for the money,"I bought these headphones to replace the ones I broke here in Afghanistan. I have used this brand before, but they have changed slightly, and the changes are for the better. There is now woven material covering the wires where they branch off and go to the earpieces. The sound quality is excellent, though the bass response isn't. This is to be expected with such a small driver, and I am more concerned with hearing all the instruments in a song than my ears vibrating. The three ear piece sizes are nice, and should accommodate any ear canal. It also comes with a second set of three ear pieces. For the price you pay for these, you cannot beat them. I highly recommend these for anyone who is active (I use them for working out and tuning out explosions at night in Afghanistan). I gave it 4/5 only because there is room for improvement on the bass, and having a 4th size of ear pieces would be nice."
1,DON'T BUY THESE!!!,"As some others have written these sound great at first but they are NOT worth it. They will develop a short circuit in the plug after about a month of regular use. Then you'll only get sound from one side. It's happened to me with two different sets from different v-moda lines. To make matters worse, their customer service is terrible and will find any excuse not to honor the warranty. Save yourself the headache and find another brand."
4,V-Noda,"Excellent sound quality especially the bass. The satchel to hold it could have been made a bit larger to accomodate all the pieces. That said, the product came with a good selection of ear pieces which made it easy to find a comfortable fit."
1,"Great, until they break, and they WILL break.","I was one of those people who pours over reviews before buying anything. I saw that tons of people adored these earbuds. They're stylish, have great sound and deliver very nice bass. They were probably my favorite headphones I owned... until they broke. Like a NUMBER OF PEOPLE on this website have stated. After about four or five months of use (and only about 2 or 3 times a week) the sound in one headphone just ""POP"" died. That's not what I expect from $70 earphones (that's the price when I bought them). I, of course, didn't have my receipt so I couldn't get a refund. Please do not be like me and think that ""Oh it probably won't happen to me."" Because it will. I used them gently and put them wrapped up in the case that was provided, in the fashion that v-moda suggested and they still broke. Don't take the chance. Keep searching! These aren't worth the risk."
1,Great until they break!,I thought i had defective pair of headphone until i started to read other reviews. I had the same problem that many other people have had...after a few months i noticed the left headphone sounded softer. It got softer and softer until i forced to stop using the headphones. While these are a great LOOKING pair of headphones do not invest in these if your looking for a product that will last. After having spent 80 dollars I have to go out and buy a different pair of headphone now
1,Sound in 1 earbud cutout after 4 months. Read other reviews.,"I would not recommend this product. Some reviews talked about the sound cutting out from one ear bud but I figured these were isolated incidences. I figured wrong. After only about 4 months of relatively light use with the volume never really going above 50%, sound in one of the ear buds has decreased significantly. The sound does not completely cut out so I do not believe it is an intermittent connection but rather some other defect. Subsequent searches through reviews have discovered several similar complaints of defective ear buds. One can only wonder how many others never took the time to write a similar review. Regardless of any possible warranty to pay this much money for these and have them consistently fail is frustrating, a waste of time and money, and indicative of a horrible product.My advice is to look to some other brand entirely. Avoid V-Moda. Trust me, and others, you will save yourself a lot of grief and money."
3,"Great sound, crappy construction","I loved the sound on these headphones, but they are extremely fragile. A friend and I both purchased these five months ago, and both headphones are already broken. The joint between the wires breaks very easily. Additionally, the metal part on the ear bud can scratch your screen. It left a gash across my creative zen."
3,bass heavy,"I'm going to skip right to my first hour impressions here, I get the distinct impression that the manufacturer is artificially boosting the bass on these headphones. Could be a fit issue, could be I need to wear them for a few days but at the moment the low end is distractingly muddy. They remind me most of the Koss plugs in that respect. Right now I prefer my old (and broken) shure e2c cans but I'll be sure to edit this review should things change over the next week."
1,not worth the price,"These earbuds are not worth the price at all. As a matter of fact, they are pretty cheap.The cord is thin, and as much as I workout, they tangle easily creating a situation for easy breakage.The buds keep falling out of your ear no matter which size I use (s, m, l)and they slip out very few seconds...The noise cancelling job is pretty good though. The bass is nice, but as much as they slip out of your ear and tangle, it's not worth it. I regret wasting my time with them."
3,"Good sound quality, bad build quality","I like the sound quality on these headphones and the noise isolation, but the problem is the build quality. I've had to return these headphones within 9 months of purchase when the sound for them just cut out on both sides. Less than 10 months after they shipped me a new one (or my repaired earphones that I sent back), the right ear bud is now dead. Since warranty only lasts for 12 months, I cannot get them fixed again.They look good, they sound good, but they're going to break..."
4,Works well for me,"As someone that uses a mp3 player everyday and for aprox 3 hours a day.....I have been very happy with the V-moda ear buds. I have used the bose tri-ports for many years and faced problems like poor design and comfort level, clear but low sound and lots of breakage. 4 times I had to swap out that product due to unexceptable wear and tear. I have been very please with the sound quality, bass level and comfort of the V-modas. They fit nice and snug, look great and sound fabulous."
2,Great while it lasted,"The sound was great but the rubber around the plug ripped and exposed the wire. If you use your earbuds as much as I do, get one with a different kind of plug. The kind with the L shaped rubber with the ""flex"" ribs. This just had too much stress on the cable.I loved it while it lasted though. Paid way too much for earbuds that only last a year though."
2,Pass on these,"I've had these headphones for just over a year and just like many of the other reviewers I thought these headphones were pretty great at first. My particular pair is the gunmetal variety and they definitely are really sleek looking.Sound QualityThe bass was a touch overpowering in contrast to all the other notes but as I work in a loud call center environment I preferred that. However as time goes on the bass quality degrades and now my right earbud has gone from full sound to low sound to finally none over a week. This probably occurred due to pulling them out via the wire but still, depressing non the less.ComfortThey had quite a few earbud sizes but for me they still manage to fall out every so often on me.OverallI can't really recommend these as I bought these a year ago and they've already crapped out on me, disappointing overall."
3,"Great looks, mediocre quality","I wear these earbuds with my ipod to run or go to the gym. This purchase was rather dissaponting. My first pair of V-Moda was much better. On the positive side, these headphones have a strong bass which I love when listening to hiphop. They look cool too, I have the Red Roxx and they stand out, not your average earbuds. However, they are very flimsy and they continually come out of my ear while working out. I tried all three inner ear sizes and none stays put. In an nutshell, there are better choices out there for the money."
1,Broke down in less than a year,The V-Moda Vibe look and sound great with plenty of bass. They were great till they stop working in one ear. I kept in the pouch all the time and still broke on me less than one year.
1,My fourth pair just broke!,Obviously I like how they sound but my fourth pair (two were replaced under warranty) just broke today. Consider that they stay in my desk or in my ears at my desk while in use. Please just buy something else and save yourself the frustration. My last pair (Vmoda Duo) lasted less than two months. I am so tired of there slow and increasingly rude customer service. It seems the positive reviews on these ear buds are from people who havent been burnt yet. I even bought my mother a pair last christmas- they broke over thanksgiving. While it is a family record for longevity for a pair of Vmodas its totally unacceptable considering I paid almost $100 each for 3pairs.
3,"Dull, muffled sound","The earbuds are beautiful and fit well. My only complaint is that the sound is dull and muffled. I got them to replace my iPhone headset, just for listening to audiobooks. I went right back to them after trying the V-Moda Vibes. While there was no problem keeping the V-Modas in place (unlike the iPhone headset) the sound is attrocious, especially considering the high price. I really expected crystal clear sound, instead the voices on the audiobooks are muffled and low, I have to crank the volume all the way up just to be able to understand what is being said. I have had better sound from $10.00 earbuds, but I thought, as much as I listen to my iPhone, I would treat myself to something nice and better. Maybe they are ok for music listening, (I wouldn't know, I have not tried them for that) but I would not suggest them for listing to audiobooks."
3,Nice sound reproduction,"Style and looks are what you get. When the wires move against your shirt, etc you get some feedback. Sound is what I purchased these for but I think they are overpriced."
3,"Good sound, bad design","These ear buds sound amazing, but they fall apart rather quickly. I have had three different pairs and they all have ether had the coating around the wires come off or the input jack to fall off. V-moda was good about exchanging the damage pair, but then it happened again. So i would suggest never ever keeping them in your pocket because that apparently causes them to fall apart. desgine"
2,last,Sound was great but did not last any longer than cheep ear plugs. The wire connection cut out after only a few weeks of using.
4,Great sound,"Great sound from these headphones, tried a few before I landed on these. The only thing I would ask for is the attachment of the wire to the headphones themselves to be a bit more durable feeling, if I were to accidently pull them from my ear by the wire I would probably be checking to see if I broke anything. I haven't had a problem with them, and the durability issue is non-existent at the moment, but i've only had them a few weeks now. As far as sound goes they are great! They also come with different sizes of rubber-tips so they should fit in most ears, this has been a big issue with me previously, they are comfy."
4,Very Good,"I ordered these for use on my motorcycle. While they don't sound as good as my in-ear BOSE, they do block all of the wind noise on the bike."
4,V-Moda Vibe Earbuds - Red Roxx,Pretty good sound for the price. Descent bass. Way better than the ones I got with my ipod. Different size ear pieces allow for a good fit and they dont fall out exercising. Cord is plenty long. Look good too.
5,Great sound for relatively short money.,"Just received the product for use with an iPhone. Tried them immediately while in the iPod mode and they're fairly spectacular for the money. Also, the package comes with a multitude of ear adapters in both black and clear to fit virtually any size opening. Hard to find something wrong with this package. Sound quality is excellent."
3,Smallest Silicone Fittings too Large for Ear,"I don't know if I'm a freak of nature or if this is a common problem for anyone else but the smallest ear fittings are too large for my ear canal. I can't get them to stay in so I don't get the optimum quality. Is there any solution for the small canaled? I am really at a loss hear, just want ear phones that stay in my ear."
2,"Good Sound, Poor Quality (at least first set)","Ordered these based on reviews of others for the good sound, figuring the reported defects would have been ironed out. I used them less than 5 times while walking (and no other time, so less than 5 hours of service) and lost all sound in the left channel. I e-mailed company and they promptly sent return instructions...now waiting to see what happens (and had to spend money on earbuds to use while waiting). If I had it to do over, I would probably just buy the Koss buds I picked up at Wal-Mart for $20...not as much bass, but at least they work. When I spend $80 on a product, I expect there to be some type of quality control."
3,Style over comfort,"Look sleak and they feel well made, so I assume durable. The sound quality is very good and it blocks some ambient noise to isolate the music. The only reservation I have is the fit. Unless you jam them down your ear canal they fall out too often for me, particularly when walking to work or in the gym. So fearing being deaf by 30 I try not to jam them too far in my ear and deal with a loose fit."
3,Great headphones - if they lasted,These headphones sounded really good and were comfortable while they lasted. After about a year of occasional use the right earbud started cutting in and out and eventually stopped working. Not sure if the short is in the earbud itself or if it's inside the cable close to the connector which is pretty easy to crimp accidentally due to its design (looks like the design has been updated now though). I do like the inclusion of the additional inserts though.
3,"Great sound, won't last","I love the sound and comfort from these earphones. I travel daily on the NYC subways and these work great to block out noise while providing great sound. The problem arise with their construction. The first pair I had were the 1st generation Vibes with the straight plug. the wire was worn down by the sharp aluminum and it eventually cut. This new design was supposed to fix that problem, and it did. But there was another problem. The little aluminum part where the 2 wires join into the 1 main wire eventually caused one of the wires to also cut. So same problem, but from another part of the earphones. I do love the sound and design but when my friends $30 skullcandies last longer than 2 of my $100 Vibes, I call it quits."
4,People might not get use to the loud bass.,"The earphones stands out from the rest, having one of the most unique colors out there. I heard the end of the earphone jack but mines is still in top condition after 2 month of use. Some of the people might not get to the super strong bass and find it uncomfortable. The only problem I have with it is the sound cancellation doesn't work that well."
1,worthless,"well when i got these, i wasn't impressed with the flashy packaging or the cute little pictures on the box. I opened them up, tried them out, etc, etc. they worked fine so i used them for about 2 months, until one day the right one just decided to stop working. so you're telling me that i payed $25 for 2 months of music? a $5 pair lasts longer than that. these are absolute junk. don't waste your time with this slack off french brand, get something that'll last longer. Another thing, the sound quality wasn't even that great. they had SOME bass but thats about the only outstanding attribute. for comfort, they felt like every other pair of silicon buds. Also, the color ""midnight blue"" is a lie. Yes, they are blue, but its a light-teal-metallic-gayish blue. not the intimidating and sexy dark blue depicted on this website. This product is an epic failure. Don't even waste your time thinking about buying them."
4,"Great Sound, Cord is a Nuisance","Great sounding and great looking earbuds. They beat Apple's supplied crappy earbuds hands down for sound and comfort. Love them with the exception of the cord, which seems to tangle easily since it's cloth covered rather than rubber. But overall they're very good!"
2,Scratchy Scratchy Scratch Scratch,"Okay so I had pretty high expectations for this product, because of the many reviews it got and how awesome these looked. It was very deceiving, when I got home and popped these out, plugged them in I was sooo disappointed with the highs on in the headphones. It was very scratchy every time something not even that high would be playing...The lows were good BUT they do not make up for the highs. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES UNLESS YOU ONLY LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH JUST LOWS."
3,Pathetic longevity,"As most of the reviews have said,these brand of earphones have amazing sound quality. However, its reputation is marred by the pathetic life. These pair lasted around three months. Now, they're both dead (earpieces). I wish V-moda would listen to our reviews and try to make the connection between the earpieces and the connector stronger. It was very ironic, I thought the wire problems seemed pretty nonexistant, and I thought that this would be the last pair I would buy. By golly, was I wrong."
3,Not what was expected,"I already have a pair of these and I really like them and wanted to get another pair of the new and improved. The ones that I have sound great and look good, but the outside cable jacket is easily torn. The new style from what I understand have a new material and the angle of the jack has changed from a straight in to a 45 deg. This is what is pictured, but NOT what I got. Had to send them back."
2,"sound is ok, durability is poor","I had no problems with the sound. I'm no audiophile, so perhaps I'm not the best judge, but I thought the sound was fine.My biggest problem is that they broke after 6 months of mild use. I used them perhaps twice a week (for an hour?) and never mistreated them, so there is no excuse for them breaking. The left headphone just stopped working, there were no disconnected cables or anything.My other complaint is about the cords. They have a flexible woven metal sheath. It has a horrible tendency to get bent & twisted up. Every time I used them I tried to straighten them out. Then I put them away in a pocket or backpack, pull them out and they're just as bent & tangled. I found it really annoying.Overall I would NOT buy again. After they broke I bought a replacement by a different company."
3,"Great sound, wish it lasted longer!","The sound on these earphone is fantastic!!! I bought mine on August 21, 2009. They officially died on May 6, 2010. I guess 8 months isn't too bad for headphones. I treated them well (always kept them in a case when not in use), but I used them a lot. I don't really know what the average life span is on headphones in general, though I might see if I can find something that will last longer for the next purchase. Quality was great though!"
3,last 2-3 months at best,"They have a very awesome sound quality, including excellent bass. But I have gone through 2 pairs within 5 months. Thank god for the one year warranty."
3,I would look elsewhere,"These earbuds sound great. They block out a lot of outside noise, but not enough that you feel unsafe running on city streets. They look good and feel secure. However, they are not very well made. I bought these a year ago and one side stopped working after the third week. I couldn't see any exposed wiring and had been taking good care of them. They were replaced under the warrenty, but it took ages. I have had the second pair for eight months or so and one side has stopped working. They are not well made, the wiring is way too flimsy to use for my everyday life. I need headphones I can work out with, run with, as well as use for everyday. It seems that my money would be much better spent on a different brand. Summary: these headphones are only good for people who are prepared to be gentle and be very careful."
2,Amazing for about 3 months,"When I first received them they sounded amazing, loved every bit of them from their looks to the sound. I used it fairly actively ran a lot with it walked everywhere with them on etc.Now first thing to go was the metal sleeve on the 3.5 connector, it was sliding off and whatever no big deal this happened about a month in. Then the next thing to go was my left ear buds insulating wire, exposing it slowly, still worked fine but it was slowly dieing, then near the connector the insulation broke there too exposing the wire. Then the right earbud's wire was exposed then the left one stopped working altogether. That's when I got new earbudsOverall, i wouldn't buy these again, almost got tempted since i noticed it had a different design on the connector so i thought maybe they got better, but this time i'm gonna heed other peoples reviews and still not get them."
1,Piece of junk.,"Boy would have I loved to rate these Earbuds 5 stars, but what can I say, it just died for no good reason after just 5 months.When it was alive it was ""awsome"" great bass mids and highs, now that they are dead ducks I have to pay for shipping it back to V moda, I am just wondering what is V moda thinking? how long will people put up with paying a premium price for a piece of garbage? And I DID handle it gently."
3,"When they work they work, but these will fail","I've been through two sets of the Vmodas in the past year. I bought one pair and within 3 days the earbud just died on me, took it back to apple and they were very nice about it, gave me a new pair. They also informed me that this happens frequently with this brand. I was quite annoyed the know that I spent 100 bucks on headphones that are known for dying but I kept them. They lasted me luckily longer than others on here, mine lasted for another 11 months, except the earbud just sounds muted not dead. This time I expected it which was a ""relief"" but now i'm on the hunt for another pair of headphones.There are some pluses, the sound quality was decent not as good as my Shures though. The cord was quite durable and the headphones took quite a bit of abuse from me. The earbuds rarely ever came off the headphone and while running these buds never moved from my ear. If they weren't known for breaking so frequently, I would recommend these but not now."
1,They didn't even last me TWO months!,"I bought these on June 6, 2009 and they gave out on me two nights ago (August 19, 2009)! One of the ears just up and stopped working! I have to constantly adjust the wiring just so that the dead ear bud can come back. What's the point of this high grade wire protector if they're just going to give out anyway!? And at $50+ I expected much more from this...FAR more. AT LEAST a year...if they had lasted me at least a year then I'd at least be satisfied with my purchase, but sadly that was not the case. Cheap non-name brand ear buds from CVS lasted me longer than these things! Avoid these, people. Lest you want to suffer the same frustration I experienced. I'm going to try and see if I can't get a new or refurbished pair from the manufacturer. This shoddy overpriced merchandise cannot go on like this!"
2,STAY AWAY FROM THEM! (Unless you don't care about wasting your money),"All right, I just broke my 3rd pair...I'm not sure why I gave them so many chances.1st pair: One side shorted out after 6 months or so. Okay, fine. I liked the sound and loved the looks.2nd pair: Wire broke at the base. Spent 2 weeks with some tape and wiggling the wire until I couldn't stand it anymore!3rd pair: Left side shorted out after 6 months. All I did was get up from my seat and the sound just disappears...it's ridiculous.Unfortunately, I didn't buy any of them under warranty, so no replacements (and I'm not sure I even want them now). I've been through quite a few pairs of sound isolating headphones and this definitely has the best looks (and sounds good), but this durability almost makes it a rip-off.Needless to say, I don't recommend these at all unless you can afford a new pair every half a year and can stand the frustration of having it break."
2,THERE'S THAT NAGGING QUESTION OF DURABILITY...,"I BOUGHT THESE EARBUDS FOR MY THEN TWENTY-YEAR-OLD DAUGHER TO USE WITH HER 32GB COWAN PERSONAL MEDIA PLAYER. SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN THEY SHORTED OUT, MAKING THEM UNUSEABLE. I THEN BOUGHT A COMPETING BRAND THAT SHE WAS ALSO HAPPY WITH.APPARENTLY SHORTING OUT IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH ANY TYPE OF V-MODA VIBE EARBUDS. I DO NOT KNOW THE FOLLOWING FOR A FACT, BUT I'VE HEARD THAT V-MODA IS WILLING TO DO LITTLE OR NOTHING TO REPAIR OR REPLACE VIBE'S THAT HAVE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM."
3,nice but defective,"comfortable and cool looking. liked the fabric covered wiring which is supple and lightweight. decent sound, heavy on bass as most reviews state. returned because of defective earpiece which crackled. good purchase for the price but I opted to go to Bose after the return; more balanced and true sound with greater clarity."
2,Great sound...but stopped working after 13 months,"They sound great, but the quality for the price is not. My left earbud went out today after just over one year. I had to throw them away. $100 (what I paid) in the garbage. That is completely unacceptable for supposedly high-quality earbuds. After further research, I found other reviewers who have had the IDENTICAL PROBLEM - looks like I got the second generation ""cheap"" version. If you're okay with 8-12 months of working earbuds, these are for you, otherwise look for something more durable."
2,"Good sound, Bad quality","I bought the red version of these earbuds in January 2008 after tons of research. A lot of the negative reviews I read were about the earbuds shorting out. In my case, after about 2 months, I noticed that the left earbud was now playing at a MUCH reduced volume. At first I thought it was just the stereo mixing of music, but then I realized that, indeed, the volume and bass coming from the left ear bud was very quiet, and now it annoys me to listen to. A couple of months in and I'm SOL - especially since I bought them for $65 on Amazon without a warranty. Splurge for buying them from the manufacturer so you can get them repaired.PROS: Sounds good, look great, easy to get in and out of ears (compared to Shure).CONS: They are already shorted. :("
4,Excellent Sound Quality for the Price,"Sometimes the sound quality tends to feel a bit too warm when listening to classic music, especially orchestral work, but not to the point that the music itself becomes blurred. Overall very good sound quality for the price."
2,Lasted less than a month,"I purchased these at Costco for $40 3 weeks ago for my son. I thought ""ooh, kevlar reinforced, this is perfect!"" Three weeks later, the left earphone stopped working. They are still under warranty and I just sent them back for replacement, but based on what I'm reading here, I have low expectations for the next set. I would have given them just 1 star but my son said he really liked the sound quality (lots of bass just like a 14 yr old would like)."
5,Great Sound !,"After the initial ""prime session"" these earbuds are fantastic. Good mid and highs but the low end definition is awesome. The low end never mutes out the higher frequencies and everything from rock to sweet bass dubstep sounds clear.Once you get used to the insert versus the headphone aspect the initial awkardness is gone (as is most of the exterior noise!)I have been using my pair 4-5 times per week at the gym and when I travel and for over two years now I have not had a problem. Don't know what folks are doing to theirs to make'em fall apart.I have recommended them to friends and they have not regretted their purchase one bit!"
1,Not good for Iphone !,"I searched for earphones compatible for Iphone and i got these as results....but, when i received these, i found out that it didn't have a mic ! I was surprised how they advertised these as compatible for Iphones !Now, i need to use the Apple OEM whenever i get a call..."
2,"great sound, unnecessarily expensive....","these sound great, but the earbuds that came with my sony mp3 player sound just as good. i went with these because of the sound quality and comfort previous buyers described. they were correct in the sound quality, but the comfort other people have found i have not. i cannot wear them for more than 30mins without having to remove them. the smallest rubber ring is still too big for my ear canal. on top of this, they don't have much to hold while removing them so it takes attention, not an easy natural process. there are far cheaper options i wish i'd tried before these pricey ones."
5,Comfortable!,"I'm very pleased with the efficiency and speed of delivery (arrived two days sooner than expected), and the product itself is everything they say it is! I tend to watch shows on my iPod while in bed and lying on my side. The earbuds are almost unnoticeable in my ears. The only problem I've had is occasionally losing one of the silicone sleeves, but they provide you with sets of small, medium, and large in both clear and black. I didn't think the sound from the original earbuds was bad, but I immediately realized the difference when I received the Vibes - WOW! Comfort, sound, looks - definately a 5 in my book."
5,new part for old model,"purchased the set of V-Moda Vibe Earbudsto go with old skool cassette tape walkman.Girlfriend suggested I can listen to the tapes while exercising.Great idea!The earphones produce great sound including when using ""Super Bass"" mode.They are comfortable in my ear, though I am concerned the cusionmy come off in my ear - so I don't push them in too tightwith all the moving around, they stay in my ear andthe wire is long enough and doesn't get in the way.I'm glad I purchased them"
3,Not quite as expected,"The thumbnail on this product reflects the newer design which should be a bit hardier. However, I received the older design with the straight jack and rubber-coated wire. I'll be fine with it as the price was right and I managed to make my old pair last quite a while even with these flaws. I just wish the product images matched what was being shipped..."
3,Won't Last Long!!!,"These are probably the most comfortable and best sounding headphones for the price. The ear buds provide great comfort and noise isolation making the sound quality amazing. However, these headphones do not last. I am on my third pair in 14 months. One of the headphones will stop working after about 3 months. You really have to take care of these. Good thing that V-Moda has great customer support and replaced my last 2."
2,Not durable,"These earbuds were cute and comfortable, but didn't last morethan 13 months....sound was good too. Unfortunate they weren'tmade to last. I won't buy again."
1,Out of balance,"I had done a bit of research before I got these, so I kind of knew what I was getting into. I knew the bass would be heavy, but after a run of tinny sounding buds, what the Hell? I got them, they fit OK {not great}, and sounded better than I had had for a while.For less than a week.The sound started migrating to the left bud. At first I figured it was getting used to the fit. Then I swapped left and right and it was obviously the buds. In no time, everything had moved to one side. I pulled out some older buds and a set of full headphones to make sure. They worked fineIn no time everything was on one side.When I got these I also got a pair of V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds; less expensive, but I figured I could have an on the go pair, etc ... something to have when I didn't want to take the nicer ones.Same thing happened to those in a week. Everything migrated to one side.That's two for two, consecutively. Don't do it ..."
1,Not Like They Used to Be!,"Have owned a pair of Vibes for several years and have been happy with the sound, comfort and style. I recently bought a new set for my wife. The new Vibes, while looking the same, are not the same. The sound is shrill, with accentuated highs and poor base. Returned them and got my money back."
3,"Great Sound, Poor Design","These earphones sounds great, no question.The problem is that the rubber around the metal section breaks easily, and your ears get shocked from the exposed wires."
3,"Good looks, good quality, uncomfortable!!","I purchased these to use mainly with an Ipod Nano for running. Therefore, I really wanted:o them to stay on during runningo be comfortableThe sound quality is certainly decent, but I am having severe comfort issues. Previously, I used a Shure E3 pair that I believe was stolen, and had no issues with comfort. My ears are small, but even with their smallest earbuds I feel discomfort after 30 minutes of wear.A previous review said that they could be worn while laying on a pillow - this certainly isn't true, at least for me.Aesthetically these headphones are cool and offer a good sound quality for their price, but certainly not comfortable to wear!"
4,"VERY good, but...","These ear buds are VREY good; I like the sound, and have a pretty good base. But I'm not sure if they were worth the 80 something dollars I spent on them... but I really like the way they feel, and the sound they produce..."
2,Not particularly sturdy,"These earbuds sound fine, but not exceptional. I expected better.What annoys me most is that the stereo plug has come apart after only about a months use. Granted, the socket was pretty tight, but that same socket didn't destroy any of several other headset plugs I've used."
2,"Excellent Sound, But Not Built for Me","I had these for approximately 6 months. They sound spectacular. However after a few months of carrying them on my person with their pouch the cords frayed and broke right underneath the buds, revealing copper wire. These sound so amazing but are not worth the heartache."
2,"Great sound, poor durability","First of all these earbuds sound great. However, after only six months the wire near the earbuds started to tear away. I sent them back for a new pair almost a month ago, and they still have not shipped the new pair. Great sound but poor durability and terrible customer service."
2,"Great sound, but....","As the other reviews state, these earbuds sound great, however, I've found that they are not very durable. Within two weeks of enjoying them, I began to notice the cable near the 3.5 mm jack beginning to fray. Two weeks after that, sound in the right earbud was gone, never to return. I've just purchased the Shure EC2-n earbuds, hoping they last longer."
1,Don't buy! They WILL NOT LAST,"I'm not gonna waste your time or mine to tell you how good these sound because it doesn't matter. The fact of the matter is that THESE HEADPHONES WILL STOP WORKING AFTER ONLY A FEW MONTHS. I take great care of my stuff, but even these expensive headphone eventually stop working in the exact same way that cheap ones do. All of a sudden one day the left earpiece just stopped working for no reason. The cord is fine, and the headphone case is fine, but it just stopped working. I got these as a christmas gift from my parents and actually feel really guilty about it because they went to the store and made sure they asked for good, durable headphones but the ended up breaking just the same. Please don't buy these."
1,Ouch,"Sound not bad, but for the money i expected more. The problem I have with this particular set is the comfort, not easy on the ear, seems to grab and leave a burning sensation. wouldn't buy them again, unless they changed the material used on the tip."
3,vibe earbuds - sounds great but hard to fit,Sound quality is good but having a heck of a time keeping them in my ears. My ears or the buds?? Don't know.
4,Good Buy,"These are the best earbuds I've ever used (so far). Good bass response, and they fit well too."
1,Awful company,This are crap avoid them like the plague and company is even worst! The wire become exposed after moderately used!
2,Plug Design = terrible,"Great headphones, love the sound quality but after one warranty covered plug replacement it went bad AGAIN after the warranty expired. Vmoda offered me 50% off if I buy the new model from them (which happens to get them close to the price here at amazon) but I'm steering clear. Stay away from this company unless you like music in just one ear."
2,GOOD FOR A FEW MONTHS . . . THEN NEEDS TO BE REPLACED,"The construction and quality seems very good at first until the sound in one bud starts to cut out after a few months of usage.They do replace them and customer service is very good, I have replaced them at least 4 times since I got a the first pair for around $80.If they would last then they would be great . . . wishful thinking since they keep breaking."
1,great as long as they last,"I loved these, but now they are not working! Bought them in Oct and now they are already broken! One of the wires broke so you only get sound in one ear! NOT GOOD, quality must be poor in how they build them. So now I have to find a new set that won't break so fast!"
2,V-Moda Earbuds,"I had V-Moda earbuds. I LOVED them!!! until, that fateful wire break at the plug end. I took very good care of by V-Modas and to no avail, they broke. After the second pair, V-Moda would not replace them again. I'm so sad, I don't know where to turn. Although I was just looking for a new pair, and I noticed the V-Modas look like they have been redesigned in this area. I kept saying they need some rubber protective sleeve at that end of the cord to help prevent wire breakage."
4,Better than average,"While they look excellent,being metal and shiny,it all comes to soundThey are a type of sound that is very smooth laid back yet detailed.They also have excellent low end bass, not boomy or bassy but deep amd large.There is no listener fatigue from extendid listening of the music,The only fault I could place is a slight lack of brightness I am used to.so key words here are:smooth, detailed, laid back, good bass"
5,incredible ear buds,I love the cord. It's a material that doesn't get sticky. The buds sound great. You will love this product. Wish I had ordered more at that price.
2,Where'd the beef? (Treble),"While these are very stylish, with the silver/black metal buds and plug, andthe piece that keeps the cords from separating.. and they DO form a nice seal, blocking out ambient noise nicely, and do have nice bass... where is the treble? The whole idea of spending a bit more, for me anyway, was to get a better, more realistic reproduction of the sounds I wanted to hear.. But while you get the bass, which is IMPORTANT, it is at the sacrifice of the higher end of the range. There is either a serious variation in quality from set to set, or else some of the reviewers simply are not audiophiles, and are not aware of what is missing.I will be contacting Amazon to ask for a refund, and my search continues."
5,feel the noise!!!,"wow.. these are amazing! I had a pair of shure e2c and these just blow them away in sound and comfort. The highs can be a little tinny sometimes with certain EQ settings, but all in all, these are outstanding.. The deep and mid bass response is just invigorating.. the highs are good as long as you don't go nuts with the EQ. Also the new angled jack is a nice touch for chord longevity.. I am extremely happy with these so far!"
1,Break very easily,"I'm not sure how these have an average rating of 4.5. I bought two pairs. The first pair lasted about 4 months. The second lasted about 2 weeks. The sound is good, but don't waste your money."
2,Great sound when they actually work,"This is actually the first review I've written for amazon. When they work the sound is great for the price. I bought these headphones 5 months ago and already had two pairs fail on me. One side just goes out completely. VModa has been good about replacing them, but they should not have this high of a failure rate."
1,Junk,"I was in love with these phones for weeks. They're shockingly comfortable and the sound isolation passes the New York City subway test with flying colors. Unfortunately, they're cheaply built and it appears the mini-jack isn't up to spec. After a few weeks, mine inexplicably decided it wouldn't work unless it was only inserted about halfway into the socket. (At first I blamed the socket but trying it on other devices made clear the phones were at fault: it looks like the jack is just ever-so-slightly too small!) This defect makes them pretty much useless. Some other reviews referred to there being three generations of this product, a quality first generation, a shoddy second generation, and a supposedly improved third generation identifiable by the 45 degree angled jack. The ones I got were the 45 degree version but still shoddy."
3,"Poor durability, ok sound",I just purchased these right after the new iphone 3g had come out and right off the bat I noticed that the sound quality was not as clear nor noise reducing as my 4 year old Shure EC2's. Just yesterday my right earbud stopped working. Also one thing I had noticed with these headphones is a static shock from time to time.[...]
2,Meh....I wouldn't buy em...,"I bought two pairs of V-moda Vibe headphones so far, the first one split at the connector and broke, I wasn't able to get them replaced. The second pair spitted near the earbuds, got those replaced. They sound absolutely GREAT with wonderful bass but they just suck build wise. I'm completely done with this company, will never buy from them again. Just ordered a new pair of Shures, hopefully those will last longer than the Vibes."
2,Why no microphone?,"In the products picture it look like there is an microphone on it, like the normal iPhone version has, but no...If you wish to here only music with it, it's very good, but if you wish to talk in the middle or here out side noises from the traffic (if you walk) it's risky."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I recently purchased these, about 1 month ago, and the left speaker blew out all ready!! The cord has torn. Just do not buy these. The sound is really not that great. The only nice feature is how it looks. What a waste, I can't get a refund or a replacement. Not what I expected from 85 dollar earbuds."
1,Bait and Switch Con Job! You've been warned.,"There are two generations of The V-Moda Vibe... the first generation, manufactured in China by a company called OTC, and a 2nd generation, with a different sound, different components, different manufacture, and way less build quality and sound quality.This is confusing and unfair... many reviews refer to the original version.. especially reviews on enthusiast boards, and that quality and sound is long gone... the modern professional and enthusiast reviews are nearly always negative, and the product is not recommended.I suggest you stay away from the Vibes... better and cheaper options abound.To be fair, customer service at V-moda is excellent.. you'll probably need it."
1,Not Durable,"I have had these earphones for a few months and with generally light usage.They have developed a short in the wire near the jack.Although the sound was good, I would NOT recommend because they did not last long."
2,Looks good but doesn't last,"I bought these for over $100 from the apple store, but they lasted barely three months before one side went out. They look good and are stylishly designed and come with the remote answer/hangup button just like the original iphone headset. The sound was average. Quite acceptable, but not as good as my Shure e2c in-ear phones. Definitely recommned looking elsewhere if you're going to subject these to anything but the gentlest usage."
2,"Excellent sound, poor build quality","Assuming they are functional, these headphones probably have the best sound quality at its price point.However, the right earphone shorted out a little over a year after moderate use. The wire near the headphone jack had become loose. V-MODA does NOT have a repair service at this time (I called)."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I decided to try these, replacing a set of Bose in ear. Big difference. They just don't have the sound quality that I had become accustomed to..... But that is the difference between $25 ear buds, and $100 ear buds. I do love the color."
2,5 months till left bud faded to nothing,"Had no problem with these for a few months and I liked the high quality/durability wrap around the wires. A little after 4 months, I noticed that the left bud was getting softer and it finally quit making any noise except for harsh distorted sounds during my spoken podcasts I listen to. Oh well, I bought them at a place I could still return them and got my money back but won't be buying another pair of these. It didn't appear that there was any wear on the wires, and if I wiggled it there was not the tell-tale ""good, not good"" sound when a wire is fraying or has a bad connection internally."
2,Whole Lotta Bass,"I order these earbuds to replace a pair of OEM ipod earbuds. For the most part the reviewers talked them up pretty well and they seemed to be worth a try. The only way I can describe these earbuds are that they are very, very bass heavy. No amount of EQ could could correct this. If you love the sound of bass you will probably think these are the greatest but you can also buy bass heavy earbuds for $2 a pair all day long. Everyone has their own preference in the type of sound they like from a pair of earbuds. I know that these just didn't do it for me."
3,V-MODA Vibe Earbuds,"I wanted the gun metal version, but they were out of stock and more expensive. These blues one work well and came with a decent set of accesories. (Carry pouch, different sized ear pieces)."
3,Shockingly Good,"Earphones sound good as others described, although my one pet peeve is due to the metal casing on the earbuds. In the winter time, when everything is dry and static is in the air you will get a little electric shock in the ear. This can be quite annoying."
3,"Looks Beautiful, Sounds Okay","Pros:- Looks gorgeous, like something from Bang & Olufsen. You will get compliments.- Excellent sound isolation.- Good customer service.Cons:- Disappointing quality. After five months of use, the plastic covering near the 3.5mm plug became loose and exposed the wiring.- V-MODA sent me a new pair, however, they feel cheaper. The metal that houses the headphones feel lighter and cheap, at first I thought they were made of plastic.- The newer headphones sound different. The highs and mid-tones sound muffled, and the bass lost its punchiness, and the frequency sounds too low."
4,Awesome bass,"Worked really well but broke twice. Comes with a nice 1 year warrenty but make sure you don't send in your reciept without making a copy cause if you break it a second time, you still need the reciept. The bass is amazing but too much bending of the wire will cause one or both of the earphones to stop working so needs some taking care of."
1,"Good sound, but they are DISPOSABLE","These are 100 times better, sound wise, than the Apple earbuds that come with the iPhone. However, they are so poorly constructed that they develop problems within 6 to 9 months of use. Not what I expect of earphones that cost $100.00+. The company does have a warrantee program, but who wants to spend this much to jump through hoops returning the product (and you HAVE to follow their steps exactly, or they will not process the return) after only a few months of use?THere are better earphones on the market in the same price range."
2,Great! Only if they worked!!!,"If you look at most of the reviews at apple.com they speak the truth. They are nice looking but don't last. My pair lasted about 4 months before dying and I keep reading that the replacement pairs are just as bad so it gives me little hope.So keep you money. I paid over 100 for these so they are cheaper here but they still will die on you. I'm not sure how this company is still in business with these faulty headphones and multiple complaints. I'm just it's not like that for everyone but considering how many bad reviews there are for this item, I wouldn't take the chance.---UPDATE---I just sent them in for repair and they sent me the wrong pair back. My pair had the headset feature and the new pair doesn't!! Plus I heard the the jack is the issue and have already updated their pair with a new jack and this replacement pair has the old version. That's not right to me. I doubt this pair will last. Let's see what they say about their mistake."
4,Exellent sound/fit. Crapy audio jack.,Agree with most previous reviewers.I like them a lot.But audio jack failed within 3 weeks of usage. It's still usable but very annoying.
1,"Good sound, not durable enough","For 8 months I used these fairly infrequently. Sound in the left ear broke away, like many others. They are extremely poorly designed because this happens to many throughout the internet. I don't think this product deserves stars because they need to do something instead of just ignoring the pink elephant in the room. $100 earphones in the trash."
4,New version is better,These newer version of the Vibe - Gunmetal black is better than what most people have reviewed because they have replaced the input jack so it does not bend as easy and the color is no longer greenish. The pouch is black as well. I rated this as a 4 star because I also own the bass fréq and test them both and bass fréq performed better in the base category but I think that's fine because I mainly bought the new Vibe for longer lasting head-phones.
4,"Good, not great","I have tried virtually every earbud known to man, and I am always looking for a new alternative. I tried these earbuds to replace my Sennheiser CX300s. After a couple of weeks, I went back to the Sennheiser 300s. The Vodas were a little bass heavy for me while the Sennheisers were much more even. Both are good, but the Sennheisers are my preference...."
3,ear buds are bulky,"These ear buds have great sound quality, though practically, they are slightly too heavy for the ear bud to adequately hold them in your ear. I am constantly fussing with them on the train because they will just fall out. I have recently started using the sports ear adaptors for more support, and they work better, though, I prefer as little as possible when it comes to earbuds and these are definitely not petite with the sports ear-clip attachments. I only bought these a month ago, and despite their great sound quality, I'm already looking for new smaller buds."
4,Good earbuds for the price,"I bought these earbuds back in June 2007 to match my red ipod. For the price they produce a great sound, you can definitely hear the bass, although sometimes it is a bit much. Don't forget to clean the earbuds constantly though. I got an ear infection in September and had to take antibiotics. Aside from that I dont have any complaints."
1,Great sound but not for active use!,"Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed the sound quality in both pairs headphones that I have bought. I had to buy a second pair because the first pair (was destroyed by my cats when I was away on business). However I now feel they would have suffered the same fate. I workout several times a week and you would think that these headphones would hold up under moderate activity. However, from simply taking them in and out of my gym bag the rubber on the wires has begun to seperate and expose the inner wiring. I'm very careful and take great care of my things and this just seemed unavoidable. I have had to tape them in multiple places and this just looks so cheap. My Bose headphones have a much thicker coating around the wires and I am going to use them even though they are a little more bulky."
1,V-pMODA Vibe Ear-Bugs,"I expected an $80 earbud to sound considerably better than the plastic one's that came with my iPod. Unfortunately, their description: ""Hi-definition sculpted sound curve fashioned for discerning music enthusiasts"" meant if you like listening to music coming from your phone. There was no fidelity to speak of. I was very disappointed. I had to send them back for a refund."
2,Total Garbage Hairball Wires,"These V-Moda headphones are garbage. I would only wish these on someone I disliked intensely.Why so negative?1. Sound quality is mediocre at best and volume is too low.2. The wires are made of some weird cloth coating that captures static electricity and in the dry winter months outdoors will cause the music to crackle and pop and you can even shock yourself.3. The wires seem to be designed to automatically know how to get into the biggest hairball mess of tangled cords in the least possible time. It's almost miraculous how quickly the cords get stuck in Gordian knots, no matter how carefully you stow them in the case.4. Uncomfortable in the ears- the metal parts rub on your ears after wearing them for more than a few minutes.5. Flimsy. The weird angled plug is because earlier versions fell apart after a few weeks. The new angled plug doesn't add much to durability and instead helps to make the cable tangle up more.Run away from these."
3,Mechanical Turk Review,"I found the product description to be exceptional and with great detail about the design. The color choices are excellent and stylish beyond most other products of this type. I found it to be a product worth recommendation to others. (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
3,"Great sound, cheap quality",This is my third pair! The first pair broke and the manufacture replaced it. The second pair broke but it was past the warranty date. The third pair I bought broke extremely quick! I'm starting to wonder about the quality of this brand. The earbuds have great sound quality but they always seem to break!
2,"Great sound, great fit, short life","I had done a lot of research and had bought another pair of highly rated earbuds, only to find low bass response. Finally tried these Vibes. I loved the deep, rich bass (to me, not overpowering)--the only earbuds where I could really FEEL it. I also liked the good fit in the ear, blocking out other sounds. I also thought the wires looked sturdier than others. Well, here it is 2 years after I bought them, and like others have said, the wire leading into the jack frayed, leaving these basically useless. Too bad, since most else was very good. If you can go with less bass, try the Shure brand: they seem better built."
2,Very poor durability on my pair - customer service fails,"I bought the Red Roxx less than a year ago. Although the sound is great, the plastic around the wires has disintegrated in many areas along the wire - the sheathing is just not durable enough to support anything more than infrequent use. My product certainly failed the daily use test.Customer service leaves much to be desired. They claim I mishandled the earbuds, and that's the main reason the plastic has disintegrated. They'd be happy to repair them, and the repair cost would be less than a new pair - by about $20. I wouldn't let V moda repair them for $50 - they should've done it for free, and as a result of the poor customer service I encountered, I won't buy another pair.I think half the price you pay for an item at this level is for customer service. In this area, V moda falls far short of the mark."
1,BIG RIP-OFF,"Please read other negative reviews. It's all true about poor quality, terrible customer service, etc. I can't even agree with some on the sound quality-- I thought the V-modas way too brassy. Also, the cord is way too long and too stiff. It's a hassle to deal with it all of the time. Try the Klipsch ear buds that are so highly rated on CNET. Same price as the v-modas, but a world apart in sound quality. It's no wonder that COSTCO had a huge display of the V-modas...... These really are just JUNK."
2,Good while they worked,"I've had these for a bit over a year. The sound was good initially, but over the last few months the left channel has been getting quieter and quieter. I'm a little obsessive about taking care of stuff, and have never had this happen with any of the other half dozen sets of earbuds I've used."
1,Poor construction,"LIke others have stated, the construction and durability are terrible. I have had two pair, the first lasted a month, the second a week, with both tearing in the same location....where the wire meets the headpiece. The tear is not visible, but the absence of sound from that side is. Simply a waste of money for a ridiculously over-priced product. If the cost were $10 or so, it wouldn't bother me but for these price points it certainly does."
4,Excellent headphones,"These headphones produce great sound and are quite comfortable. I use them with my ipod nano and have been completely satisfied. The only thing bad I would say about them is that they are expensive, otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars."
4,Perfect fit and a good treble to boot!,"The original iPhone earbuds were bothersome for me - not sufficiently sound-isolating to be used as the *only* buds while traveling in the air, and not comfortable enough otherwise. Also, they did not remain in place, and were not meant for use while walking etc.I purchased these from a local store (which shall remain unidentified) since they had a ten-off coupon for it. First impressions were good - the in-ear buds fit well, sound quality is good and what's more, I did a back-to-back comparison with the original buds - the Vibe produces a better treble any day! Coupled with the sound-isolation provided by the snug fit, these are worth serious consideration. In comparison, the Bose ones at 99 reportedly are not well suited and have heavier bass.Overall, I am happy. The one gripe? The carrying case is actually not leather - it is pleather,synthetic leather or bi-cast leather (yep, man-made). So, is it a case of false advertising? Quibble .. not a gripe!:-)"
2,Ouch my ears! Why are my expensive headphones falling apart?,"I bought these a few months ago. They seemed to be a great improvement over the predecessors the Shure E2C's and a set of Sony Earbuds. The sound is great, these have great clarity and range. The problem is they start to irritate your ears if worn for more than about an hour. I tried every different size adapter and still, ouch! The second thing is that now they have fallen apart. The wires started to seperate at the jack and eventually broke leaving only the strain relief to hold the the jack on. The last thing is characteristic of all earbuds. This is the separation of the rubber ear interface from the earbud. I would take them out of the little gold bag and the little rubber earpiece would going flying off and leave me to hunt the floor of the airplane cabin to retrieve it."
4,Best bang for the buck!,"I don't understand why so many people are giving these headphones such a terrible review. For the record, I have spend over $200 on headphones before and these are only slightly below the rating of the expensive ones. I had issues with the first pair but it my own fault. I got the cord snagged on a dumbbell at the gym and it ripped out. However, I purchased another pair last October 2009 and I am still using that pair 5 days a week or more. Good treble, extremely powerful bass. I would suggest that for the audiophile that enjoy strong bass in their music, these headphones are for you."
3,Disappointing V-moda product,"Other reviewers are correct, these earbuds are nowhere near the quality they used to be. The metal is cold when you put them on and the sound quality is only so-so. But then, these were some thirty dollars less than the first ones I bought.These are acceptable for the sub twenty dollars I paid"
3,Not the sound quality i was hoping for,"I heard many good things about the sound quality but I don't know if it's because the design has changed and perhaps worsened or if it's because I just expect something totally different but I was disappointed. While not bad overall, these headphones can't compare at all to my Shure SE110s or PortaPros which aren't too expensive either. I was hoping for buds with a little more bass which was indeed delivered. Unfortunately, the clarity really suffers. There's also no good seal compared to any of the Shures I've owned. I'm just glad it was only $15."
2,Do not get this earbud,"I got this earbud December 2008, it broke by August 2009... not even 1 year. I also paid 79.99 at the time for this piece of crap, and the apple store was selling them at 129.99! No wonder it's now 20 dollars on amazon!Only thing good I have to say about these earbuds is that it's comfortable and it looks nice. That's it. Sound quality is ok, nothing spectacular, and it's not noise canceling by any means."
1,Not durable.,"The sound is decent. A bit bright on the treble, nice bass. I'm not very much of an audiophile, but they sounded fine for my purposes.The problem is the durability. They were treated gently, as what would be expected of casual use. I use them during my commute to the city, nothing that would put atypical strain of them. Only 3 months after buying the ear buds they started to cut and eventually stop working on the right ear, the cause being a wire loose at the plug. Customer service was decent, and when I sent back the faulty buds they sent me a new pair back.Now, only 8 days after the 1 year warranty expires, on these ""repaired"" earphones, the right ear is cutting on and off again, this time sensitive to movement at the ear piece. When counting the days it took to ship it, and the 10 days or so in between sending them back the first time and waiting for the replacement to arrive, I got considerably less than a year's use out of them, and now they're basically dead.Not cool."
2,"Great looks, sub-par performance","I purchased these headphones twice. The first time was in summer 2008. The headphones were awesome. However, they crapped out after about two months. I returned them and went with a cheaper set of headphones.I was craving some nice headphones, and I saw the price on these is substantially down from 2008, so I bought them again (spring 2010). Big difference! The external looks are the same, but build quality is down and the sound quality and in-ear comfort is way down. These are headed back to Amazon for a refund."
2,Good sound...if you can hear the sound,"First of all these headphones work great....for a month or two that is. My pair had an earbud's sound go out and it never came back. Mind you I take really good care of my things.(I'm pretty sure most of you do too) At first I would have to shake the junction point where the 2 wires to the earbuds went into one wire passing a metal coupling and it would work but then it finally went out. When they did work I really enjoyed the sound quality and the lack of tangling because the cable fiber and speaking into it was invaluable while on the move with the phone. The sad part was I purchased my headphones through an unauthorized seller and V Moda would not honor their 1yr warranty in full, they will only give me half off of the same pair of headphones. I DON'T recommend purchasing these headphones unless you want the same thing happening to you and from reading numerous other reviews, this is a common failure with their products."
5,This is what fun sounds like,"I must admit that I am a novice to so-called ""world music"", where you often find the brilliant tunes of the Gipsy Kings classified. However, I picked up a copy of this disc at the public library on a whim and immediately purchased it at my local store along with several other of the band's recordings.This is an live album essentially, and captures much of the passion and fun that a studio cannot adequately convey. The shouts of joy and talking between songs makes the recording feel more real and organic and gives the true air of musicians jamming and enjoying themselves immensely.As a novice guitar player, the sounds these folks create with a few guitars and their voices is inspiring. The fact that it makes my daughter dance with joy every time I play it makes it a keeper for the heavy rotation shelf."
5,AWESOME,This album is just incredible. One of my desert island favorites after owning it for 12 years.
4,Festive recording,"Great GK album in keeping with all their other CDs. The songs sound like they are performed before an audience, with people shouting things like ""Ole!"" and so on in the background. So on the one hand it's not quite as clean and sterile as a typical studio recording, but at the same time the live feel adds a festive and energetic quality that's pretty refreshing if you like some atmosphere to accompany your music. As far as I can tell the recording is solid, the background noises usually fade after the songs get going."
5,Louis Armstrong at his best,"You can't ask for more, his distinctive gravelly voice and virtouso trumpet playing the man was and still is a giant!!"
5,a heapin' helpin' of the brightest stars,"This one clearly rates more than five stars. If you love Satchmo and you're looking for some of his finest performances in every way, this CD is a real find. Alternate takes are peculiar when they stop and then start again after the first version, but the sound is so clean and the substance so wonderful... Terrific band includes Louis on trumpet and very capable personnel on clarinet, trombone, piano, bass and drums. About 77 minutes. How about that!"
2,Worked for awhile,"Was very happy with this trash can when I first purchased it. But, it's now been 8 months and I just discovered that the latch for the battery cover is broken off. This causes the batteries to sag and then the lid opens and closes continually without stopping.Customer service for iTouchless was less than helpful, just telling me that this isn't covered until the year warranty and good luck. A replacement lid is $40.I'm very disappointed. Now I have a trash can without a lid."
2,Didn't last long enough!,"This trash can was the envy of everyone who came into my kitchen and saw how cool it worked! But after about a year, the magic wore off and the lid of the trashcan no longer works. The little plastic mechanism that controls the lid must have been put together rather poorly with cheap materials, because it broke apart and is now completely useless. The lid no longer goes up or down. It just sits there. I'm ready to get rid of the whole thing and just go back to a plastic trash can, unless I can find a replacement lid that isn't too expensive. I'm so disappointed. I sure did love it while it worked. But it just didn't last long enough. So sad. :("
5,"Touchless Trash Can, 13 Gal.",We broke out first one (our fault) and were so pleased with it we bought another. The best kitchen trash can we've ever owned.
5,Excellent product but high priced,I bought this first at Costco for < 40 but the plastic mechanism to open/close the lid broke after 1 yr. So I bought another one from Amazon. This one cost me $70+. The cost is steep but the product is just the same. The batteries last for a long time. Just be careful of the battery cover. You may want to duct-tape it before you start using it to ensure it does not fall into the trash.Other than than this product is excellent. Very convenient and all our guests just love it and want one too. Highly recommend.
4,Great Trash Can,Its a greattrash can. But the ring which may or may not be used to hold the plastic bag is very delicate.
3,Not that impressed,"I purchased this product hoping it could help eliminate some of the odor from discarded puppy wee pads. The filter really just doesn't make a dent in the odor level.I don't understand the need for the flashing ""On"" light, it's annoying and red, which makes it seem more like a problem light."
4,Great Trash Can!!,"Very Good trash can! I have had it for about 6 months and other than the slightly sensitive sensor, it is very good for the price."
3,Nice Trash Can- but not very rugged,"I purchased this trash can a little over one year ago. It has worked well most of the time we've had it. Our neighbors and friends are amused by the self opening lid. We did have trouble recently with the drive gear breaking off from the lid. The gear is plastic and the whole design is not very robust. I think it broke off when a friend reached to open the lid and was surprised when it opened on its own. She bumped the lid while it was opening and the gear cracked. I shipped the lid back to the manufacturer and they were pretty good about sending a replacement back to me after a few weeks. The unit was still under the 1 year warranty. Aside from the flimsy cover design, the unit has worked well. Treat it with care though."
5,This is the best trash can that I have owned.,The shipping was speedy and the auto opener works great. Would recommend to anyone.
4,So far works as described,After a few weeks I am very happy with my purchase. It was a few dollars cheaper than on Sam's Club on-line.Product works as designed and even though I never imagined paying so much for a trash can if it continues to operate I recommend this product.
4,Hands-Free: It's OK!,"Having read many of the reviews before purchasing this item, I made a critical decision. Instead of just behaving like the average member of this throw-away culture, I bought some rechargeable batteries of the right size and a respectable charger. Results, no immediate problems. Downgraded one star because manufacturer doesn't take into consideration the cultural difference between the Oriental side of the Pacific Rim and the USA. It's Alright.iTouchless Stainless-Steel Hands-Free 13-Gallon Infrared Automatic Trash Can"
4,Nice little trash can,"Just got this a few days ago and wish I had bought it sooner. Its mostly stainless steel (except for the top, for which I dock it a star) and it works flawlessly. I was hesitant to buy another trash can with the automatic lid because the last one had all sorts of issues. This one doesn't. The sensor works when you think it should and it works quickly."
3,Great product - Poor customer service,"Works perfectly as described.Only problem was it came dented! The interior styro-packaging was flawless. The box exterior had no evidence of mishandling or shipping damage - not a mark. Contacting iTouchless, I was run through an 8-day ""we'll-call-you-back, file-claim-with-UPS, must-wait-5-business-days drill"" with multple messages and callbacks. During normal business hours twice I got a recording to leave a 24-hour call-back message. Once they did, once they didn't. I explained it must have been damaged before shipping and was told they would file a damage claim with UPS first. That's simply unethical. After eight days, I was told I had to return it through amazon even though I had repeatedly told them I purchased it through amazon.com. Very unimpressive.I like the product a lot and will probably hold my breath and reorder. Just hope it arrives intact."
2,Faulty,"Great idea, and convenient when it works...however:I bought two and one has a sensor that only works 1/2 the time.The other goes up and down day and night all by itself like its possessed."
5,A satisfied customer,My trash can arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Works very well and I really like it. Once you own one of these trash cans you will not want to go back to the manual type. I shopped around for price of this same item and Amazon has the best price by far of anyone else. Highly recommend this product.
2,"Works great, BUT.....","The touchless operation of this trash can works great. Easy to attach and remove trash bag and secure ring to keep bag in place. BUT, the sensor that raises the lid is too wide of range. Walk by within 2ft and lid opens, runs battery down quickly. Have gotten in habit of turning off, except will doing food prep for period of time. The function of no touch use 24-7 was what I was looking forward to. Turning on/off for most of daily use defeats the no touch perk."
4,Works good,"Works good, like the fact that the bag is totally inside the can so the dog can't pull it out. A bit annoying that when you walk too close past it the can will open. But you get used to it. The handsfree use is nice."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","The sensor and lid work great; it's the rest of the can that is poorly made. The main lid does not fit well on the metal can, and the plastic ring to support trash bag does not fit securely within the metal can, so the heavy lid sometimes tips, and the trash bag often slides down into the can. The trash bag ring is held only by friction within the walls of the can, which is not strong enough to support a full trash bag."
5,2 YEAR OWNER,Had this for a long time now. Don't think I've changed the batteries in two years. Just works- and doesn't stop working. [...] excellent. BUY IT!
2,Looks nice but not good for a small kitchen/room!,"At first I really liked the hands-free aspect of the trash can, but we have a small kitchen and the sensor goes off all the time when you get close to it. We tried turning the trash can slightly many different ways but nothing helped. After several months of being annoyed by it we just turned off the sensor all together... Also, the inside ring that holds up the liner no longer holds the bag tight and after slipping many times we just took it out so the bag comes out over the edge and doesn't look as nice. I could see if you had a bigger space where you would only walk in front of it when you need to throw something away it could be handy, but it just didn't work for us."
2,Trashcan arrived dented,"I cannot speak for how well the trash can works. I ordered this product once from another company and it arrived dented. I then ordered it from amazon and it again arrived very obviously dented and missing the power cord. I'm guessing the company changed the way they package the product or something. Amazon is sending me a new one right away, but I'm a little skeptical that it won't be dented again."
5,ITouchless Stainless Steel Automatic Trash Can,I have enjoy this trash can because I am always cleaning and throwing paper in the trash. It helps when your hands are full.
2,Battery cost makes this not worth it!!!!,The trash can works somewhat well. There are time the lid does not open but overall it work okay with some minor issues. This item takes 4 D batteries. The cost of the batteries in one year will almost be the same cost of the trash can. I do not recommend this trash can for that reason. It was fun at first but it is not fun spending $10 on batteries every 2-3 months.
3,Clean Hands Trash Can,"This trash can was purchased to replace a similar one. Although they look identical, there are two differences. The first difference is this trash can is four inches less in height. That requires you to bend over to throw trash away and the bag ""fills up"" sooner. The second item is the proximity path of this can is significantly restricted to a rather small area forcing you to be in an exact (?) position to have the lid open and stay open. The big advantage to the automatic opening and closing of the lid is you do not have to wash your hands each time you dispose of something while preparing a meal. The narrow proximity path of this can has, at times, closed the lid too soon negating that advantage. It is OK, but I would rather have those features of the old trash can."
4,"I like the trashcan, but it can act up at times","We've been using this trashcan for the last year and a half. It has worked pretty well for most of the time and guest enjoy playing with it. There are times when, as has been reported, it can act up. One time, changing batteries fixed it, but I think that the last time, I just removed the batteries for about a minute and allowed it to ""reboot"". I'd try this before throwing it away. The other issue is that it can get moldy under the lid, but that is just because it is a moist humid environment. I'd probably still buy again."
1,rusty can,Our trash can works fine the problem in the inside of the can is rusted. We would like you to replace the can free of charge. We purchase this item through Amazon.Thank you.Fred McGuire
1,Wastecan a Waste of Money,"Like others on here the one I purchased worked for about two months. At that point it started acting up - opening for no reason, not opening when needed, buttons not functioning, etc. And it is not exactly easy to return a trashcan. I truly feel I have been ripped off, am truly unhappy, and am disappointed that Amazon has not been helpful with their return policy on this. No bueno!"
4,itouch can,Its nice but was unhappy after the first week it stoped working and I had to seend for a new lid but it is working fine now.....
5,Has worked fine for six months now,This product is the real deal. I have not even changed the batteries. The lid shuts tight and even blocks foul odor to a good extent. Sensors are accurate. Do not detect motion further than 1 foot. If it lasts for two years then i have had my moneys worth.
2,plastic top broke after 1 day,"received yesterday and plastic top broke already. the sensor idea is great, but they really need to improve how the top fits. i am returning and hopefully next unit will work better."
4,Nice Can,"Got this as a wedding present in January, 2009. We've had no problems with it so far. The lid opens and closes flawlessly with the wave of a hand. Putting a bag in has a learning curve of about 2 minutes. My advice is don't place it in a high-traffic area so the lid doesn't constantly open and close."
5,Great trash can!,"We've had this trashcan for years and still love it. I think that in five years, we've changed the batteries out a handful of times. It's great for my three year old because she can help throw things away, though it (thankfully) took her years to figure out. So nice when you've got messy hands and need to throw things away quickly. My only caveat is that you'll look silly when you go to throw something away at someone else's house and are waving your hand over a traditional trashcan!"
1,Not Worth the Money,"Bought this one year ago and it is already broken. I wanted a foot pedal garbage can but had a hard time finding one and decided to take a chance on this one. What a mistake, now that an inside plastic part is broken I have a $60 piece of trash."
1,DO NOT BUY THE NEW MODEL! HORRIBLE!,They have used the same listing with the same feedbacks for their old(much better) model to sell the new one. The sensor is horrible on the new one. You have to literally hold the food on top of the trash can wait for it to open. I threw away the box so I cant return it but I'm willing to throw this thing out and find the old model or a different one.
2,Hate it,"I bought the iTouchless garbage can, because it was everything I was looking for, I loved it...at first. It does takes standard 13 gallon bags which I was happy about, I even thought that the bag ring was a good idea...at first. Now that we have been using it for about 1 month, I am ready to buy a different type of garbage can. I HATE the bag ring, it doesn't fit right half the time, the bag gets all screwed up & falls in. I am tired of fighting with the bag & ring every time I need to take the garbage out. It is taking me at least 3 times as long to change the bag as it used to. My husband actually laughs at me struggling with it & says ""was it worth it"" & I just glare back at him because we both know it was such a bad investment. I strongly discourage anyone from buying this garbage can!"
2,The lid is highly likely to break,"I've had 2 of these, and just as several other reviewers have noted, the lid is prone to break. The first 1 came from Costco, and the lid stopped going up after a few months, so I took it back and exchanged it. The 2nd one worked fine for a while, but became very erratic. It would open, and then slowly drift back to closed instead of staying open. It would also make grinding sounds as the lid gear was slipping. Finally, the gear for the lid completely broke off from the rest of the lid, and now the unit doesn't work at all.One other issue is that the lid is a bit slow to open. Sometimes it works Ok, but at other times it seems we have to wave something a few times in front of it before it finally decides to open. The ""artificial intelligence"" they advertise seems to still have some bugs.It's a great idea in general, but the quality is lacking. I'd gladly pay twice the price for a product that would last."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"While this is a very good looking trash can and looks good in my kitchen, it has more drawbacks than positives. Its hard to fit the plastic liner in it - the ring that holds it in place slips all around. Also, when you remove the liner its hard to get ahold of the ring and I sometimes puncture the bag in the process. If you place it in an area where there is traffic, the lid opens and closes every time someone walks by. But, on the positive side, it is a delight to be able to just wave your hand at it when you want the lid to open. If could do it all over again I wouldn't have ordered this item. I, unfortunately, threw the box it came in away too soon and couldn't send it back."
2,Update - no longer working,This trash can works as advertised and looks great also! I love that my garbage bag is hidden from view.12/10/12 - I felt I needed to update my review. The lid is no longer working. Sometimes we unplug it from the wall and plug it back in and it will work. Other times it doesn't. Sometimes it opens but doesn't close. It's easiest to actually lift the lid at this point rather than get frustrated when it doesn't work.
1,Sensor on lid stopped working in 2 months. Replacement failed on delivery!,"The sensor on the lid was able to open the trash can from over a foot away until after two months it stopped working. I tried all the tricks posted on line to try to fix it with no success. So I asked customer service for a replacement. They wanted to charge me shipping & handling to send the lid back and replace it after only 2 months! After some haggling, they agreed to waive the return and just make me pay for the replacement lid's shipping and handling. After receiving the replacement lid...it never worked! It was defective on delivery!!! Same problem. The sensor would only open the trash can with your hand about 1 inch from the sensor. Something is seriously wrong with their quality assurance or engineering. Don't buy their products until they fix their problems."
5,"great product, works & looks as advertised, easy process","great product, works & looks as advertised, easy process. Even the wife says ""it's good."""
4,ROBO-CAN,We've had the iTouchless trash can for about a month and it has performed well with one exception. The sensing mechanism is a little too sensitive for where we have it sitting and it will open when we walk too close to it. Other than that we like it.
2,This trash can died way too soon!,"My husband bought the 13gal itouchless stainless steel can for $200 three years ago and it was pretty cool... until I walked by it one night in the dark and it opened and scared the heck out of me. I tried moving it to different places in our small kitchen to no avail. Also, sometimes it just didn't open fast enough and I'd end up with a mess on the side of the can. Within a year it started making a horrible grinding sound when it opened then a spring popped out and that was the end. I do like the stainless steel can, and we do still have it...we've just opened it by hand for the past two years. The cool factor is definitely high but it eats batteries and didn't last anywhere near the 200k openings the product details boast. That said, I just saw one with an a/c adapter for $56 on Amazon which is cheaper than the step-on stainless steel trash cans. hmmm...who'd have thought I'd care so much about a trash can??!"
4,Auto Trash Can,Love trash can............but do not buy if you have grandchildren or little ones. They will not leave it alone
1,Lasted Christmas Morning,"Purchased as Christmas gift for my son. It worked fine on Christmas morning, but when he got it home the next day lid would not open. Only a grinding sound when passing hand above sensor. For a ONE DAY product it was fine, for long use just junk!"
1,disappointing product,"Poor response, inconsistent opening, and too much of a delay before lid open. Changed batteries without any results.Don't recommend."
5,Nice!!!!,"I had seen one at a relatives home and liked the way it worked. I decided to get one and am very happy with it's convenience, appearance, and workability."
4,Good for the price,"Overall, this trash can works very well, and is stylish enough (though I assume the ones that cost 2-3 times what this one costs look much nicer). My only problem with it is that the ring that sits between the base and the lid doesn't fit the can, and looks asif it's it was made for a smaller model. I think they just packed the wrong one in my package, and I was too lazy to do anything about it. In any case, it works fine without the ring, but the lid has to sit directly on the trash bag. No big deal."
3,"Nice while it works, but...","An elegant and effective trash can for the kitchen, looks and works great - however, with the unit I received, after four months use the lid would no longer stay open. Pressing the button would open the lid; but it would no longer stay open. Changing the batteries made no difference. Hopefully returning for a replacement, as there doesn't seem to be a worthy competitor."
1,worked great at first...,This is a nice trash can I like the fact that it is hands free. I enjoyed using this but now it has started to go thru batteries very quickly... (it was not like this when I first got it) In hind-sight I would have just bought a more basic trash can.
1,Got a LEMON! Had to return!,Got a LEMON! Had to return! Put 4 brand new batteries in.....and would not work...no light came on total dud! Amazon sent UPS return label...and it was picked up from my front porch! ....so no hassel to return! I bought another item/set and Love them! Did not want to chance getting another lemon with this one!
4,Love it!,"We've had this item for a month now and love it. It performs as advertised and is a great value for the money. It is sleek and clean in appearance, and the lid opens and closes as it should. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that when we have packed it full of heavy garbage, the inner ring has fell down off its rim a couple of times. However, we probably try to pack more in before changing liners than we should anyway!"
4,good and bad,"Good:looks nice, really is touchless (until emptying time of course)Bad:if you walk too close it opens, there is a small delay in waving your hand and opening, so be patient!"
2,Arrived Severely Damaged,"I bought this trash can as a Christmas gift. And although it arrived on schedule when it was opened it was dented so severely it had to be returned. The box it ships in is very flimsy; I'd imagine most of these cans would arrive damaged. As compared to others I've seen at stores like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond, this trash can seemed a bit cheap. Although the product was sub-par...returning the damaged item was incredibly simple. Amazon paid for all shipping costs. We didn't even have to go to the post office. I was able to print off the return label from my printer. I chose to do a complete refund and opt for one of the nicer onces from a retailer where I didn't have to worry or mess with a dented can again."
4,Love it!,"I love this trash can. I will never go back to step flip lids (step always breaks in the end) or swing top lids (which always get food splattered on them and end up smelling). It opens quickly, is just the right amount of sensitivity (so it only opens when you want to throw something away, not every time you walk by), and it closes within a few seconds. You can also press buttons next to the sensor to keep it open or closed. Because it closes firmly any offensive odors emanating from the trash are contained. I also really like that it has a ring that fits over the trash bag to keep it in place. Only complaints are that it arrived dented, and it takes 4 D batteries which are not included."
4,I like it!!!,I use these trash cans for storing my dry cat & dog food. They work great! I love that the cover opens automatically especially when your hands are full with scoops & bowls. My 2 & 4 year old nieces haven't figured out why the cover opens with no hands. The only draw back is that there is no liner.
5,Touchless,I love my iTouchless trashcan. It is compact and looks good in my kitchen. I do not have to touch the lid to use. My battery has lasted over a year. It is sturdy and easy to clean.
5,Touchless Trash Can - Review after 3 years use.,"I don't like reviews written right after the package arrives, or even after a month. We purchased this ""hi-tech"" trash can reluctantly, because we couldn't find another with a foot pedal at the time. I thought for sure we'd be replacing the battery every other month. As it turns out, we're still on the first battery after 3 years and the touch-free sensor works just like it did when new. It's great to be able to carry things over to throw away and have it just open up. The only thing you have to worry about is warning visitors about it. If they stand too close, it will open and close until they step away... which actually seems to entertain most people- especially kids. I'm not sure I'd want one if I had a dog... If I had to choose whether to buy another one, I wouldn't hesitate."
1,dont buy this,worked great for first few monthsNow it works randomly.With new battery it will sometime open reeeeeally slow and sometimes it will open so fast as if it is trying to slap someone.But mostly it doesnt open and now I am stuck with this as I am out of warranty period as well.Wish they had built it better.Loved it while it worked cause it looks good in kitchen and keeps smell inside the can but any cheaper closeable garbage can would have done the same. The touchless feature died too soon.
2,Didn't work out so well for us,"I have 3 dogs and couple of them are sneaky and get in the trash occasionally. My Rhodesian Ridgeback, however, will start ""digging"" in the trashcan if you just turn your head for a minute. I thought the touchless trashcans would be the answer for us. And it was, at first. My dogs did not like the lid opening automatically and for a few weeks it was great. I could let them roam with no concerns. Unfortunately, the metal the can is made of is not very sturdy. If you push your trash down in the bag it causes the sides of the trashcans to 'bow' out. I did not realize this was happening until the rim (which I hated because it ALWAYS seems to fall off the trashcan) and lid would no longer fit.Maybe I should have realized that the metal would bend but we really were not putting that much force when pushing the trash down. If the metal were thicker, I'd love this product."
2,"Neat Design, But Doesn't Work","The Touchless Trashcan looks great and is a cleaver idea, but the lid opens on its own and then does not close. The unit comes with directions on how to clean and reset the sensor, but they do not help. Now they want me to spend $20 on shipping to fix the unit under warranty. I would not waste my money on another."
1,Lid malfunction,The lid started opening and closing on it's own 14 months after buying it. Like many others I tried to contact the manufacturer and after cleaning and trying to reset the lid did not help they offered to sell the lid. I just can't believe that any would would be foolish enough to buy a product that lasts 14 months. Take my advice and just don't waste your money buying this product.
1,Itouch trash can,"I bought one of these trash cans. It worked just as advertised for about a month then the sensor, I guess, wouldn't work any longer. I consider this can a waste of good money."
5,What fun,"Works as described. Thickness of the metal could be greater but the price would increase as well. Packing makes shipment damage unlikely and you just have to be careful when in use. It takes a little effort to place the bag over and outside of the retaining ring to keep the top of the bag from getting messy (which would be true of any can with a retaining ring). Otherwise, it's fun to use."
2,"Worked okay for four months, then didn't","This is an okay trash can, but I've come to the conclusion that stepping on a pedal to open the trash can is much better. It's quicker and it doesn't break like this one. With the touchless ones you have to hover your hand in front of the trash can waiting for it to open. Then, when it breaks, and according to many reviews here it will break eventually, you hover your hand, nothing happens, then you pull up the lid yourself. Ours lasted about four months.I can't tell if the odor control part works or not, since I don't smell anything, maybe it's working, maybe the lid on the trash can is already containing any odors, anyway, I don't notice any odors.I would never buy another one of these things. I'm going to buy one with a pedal I can step on. Still touchless, much faster and won't break."
4,Fantastic,"We have had this can for a little over a year. Wonderful product. we had an expensive step can, which we were always trying to fix. Really no complaints, opening a little on the small side, but still great concept."
1,Sensor stops working making it useless,I purchased this in October of 2011 and it worked fine until April of 2012.The sensor has stopped activating the lid. If you push the open button it opens and the same for the close button.
1,What's up with this sensor?,"It's interesting that we have recently started experiencing the same problems that others are commenting on. Our sensor has stopped working all together. We have done everything that others say works (replacing batteries, unplugging the cord - which we had to buy separately - and cleaning where the sensor is located), yet this trash can will not work.If you are looking at purchasing this item, please PLEASE read all the comments here first. This device has a very short lifespan - typically a month."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this last week. I'm really not sure how this product gets 4 stars from others - it's a piece of junk. Right out of the box, the lid does not close all of the way. I wind up having to press the 'close' button several times. I've tried the ""leave the batteries out"" trick to no avail. Don't waste your money, and don't believe the other positive reviews. This product is, well, trash."
2,"Ghost Trashcan, would give it a 2.5 star rating.","NOTE: This is not fr the Deodorizer as mine is an older modle.Had it for a year and a half and now it has the same problems as everyone else. It opens and closes on its own. I did all of the trouble shooting, changing the batteries etc., and it still is possessed by some demon. I went to the website and they are selling the replacement lid system for about 2/3 the price that we paid for the whole can. Pretty much a useless trashcan after a while. Also the buttons on the front are so fragile that they were dented in after the first week of use. Sad really because I really liked this trashcan."
