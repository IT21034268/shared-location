1,This has more alcohol in it than over-the-counter cough medicine,"I was outraged when I realized in this ""organic"", ""holistic"" product to calm down dogs, that it has more alcohol (13%) than cough medicine for humans (10%)!! Sure, it calms a dog, who are most often half the weight of a human!! As usual, I should have looked into it more closely. It seems like in this day and age you can't take anything for granted."
4,Worked very well,"Our dog has been suffering from night anxiety since the loss of our older dog so we bought this product to try and help her (and us) sleep through the night. She drank her water with no hesitation and and an hour later was sound asleep.The only thing that makes me nervous is the directions, which say one teaspoon no matter what size adult dog. That amount worked fine for our 65 lb dog, but if I owned a smaller dog I might try less at first. You probably don't want them so deeply asleep that you can't wake them up for walks."
4,Good read about early 70's drug smuggling,"This book is about a New Yorker who engages in running drugs (Cocaine) and his adventures and dealings setting up operations in Colbumbia, Mexico and the States. It takes place in the early seventies when the smuggling ""sophistication"" was in its early stages of develpoment. The book follows Swan's rise and fall in an exciting and compelling way with some very interesting and colorful characters along the way. I can truly reccomend this book to people interested in 70's crime and drug related storys."
5,Great Book,I thought this book was a really neat read. The story tells one mans journey through the cocaine trade. The story catches you from a two angles. First the look into world of drug smuggling and smugglers and second the charaters in the story and how their lives are chnaged and different because of their connection with the drug world
1,Good story....Horribly told,"I dont often review...actually this is my first. True crime is my favorite genre, so I have read many. This story sounded good from the review's. I question myself, because only one other reviewer came close to what I felt from this book. The author goes on and on and on describing things to the point that i kept forgetting what he was talking about. I also must admit to you I did not finish this book. For me a book is about pleasure and passing the time, even forgetting about time. I felt as if I was struggling to read this book."
2,Please let this book end!,"Dick Grob is a security guy but he is NO writer. This book would be very good if it was shortened to 150 pages. The premise, that Elvis's girl friend Ginger could have saved Elvis is chilling. That she was more interested in her payday is evil. But this is the worst written book I've ever read. Still, some of the content cannot be ignored. Dick certainly had something to say. I just wish he had the book edited so it would have been an enjoyable read and would have sold much better. I still think it's not to late to do that Dick."
5,The Numerology Kit,I think this is the best book on Numerology that I have seen. Great info and very easy to work with.
2,Strange,I would guess one would need to be a die-hard JBJ fan to really enjoy the story. Music was ok but Demi Moore was annoying and poor at best. It wasn't worth the $10 spent to buy.
1,Only if you're a JON Bon Jovi Fan,"After some of the glowing reviews I read I bought this - definately not his best work, or Demi Moores', and the entire ""should have been better with this cast"" cast! Someone must have owed someone some favors. Slow and dragging, and Demi Moore was the absolute WORST - absolutely pathetic, and not due to her character. Yes, Jon's pretty to watch - but this barely held my attention and I don't think it's worth donating to charity - why would someone in need want this?! Destination the TOILET!"
4,Good acting,"I bought this because I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. The acting was very good with all the actors, but the film was too short in my opinion. It was only 45 minutes! I think it was worth it just to have if you are a big fan and want to see Jon act."
4,Where Community Connects,"I enjoyed this book overall. The Navigators were an especially compelling article included. It reminded me of DuBois and The Talented Tenth and that a few people often make decisions for the entire community. I especially liked the section on Generation 9/11. As a grad student I intend to study this generation and this gives me a great starting point. One of the things I disliked was the linking of church, community, restaurants and many other points that were not covered enough or should be covered with additional books. Each topic deserved more coverage but I understand why he was trying to link them all. It seemed a little cluttered. Overall it is a well written book and I am sure it will be assigned to participation classes in the future. I give a grade of B."
1,A Mess of Consultant Babble,"This poorly written book is mostly a fluffy mess of consultant babble. There is little material of interest or value in this book. The author's favorite catch term, ""gut value connections"" sounds like something some half-bright consultant would come up with. And they did."
5,"Dear Luther, we can Never have Too Much of you...","This is a great collection of live cuts, recorded at Radio City Music Hall, NYC, the same year that Luther suffered his awful stroke. It's really quite an exciting album to listen to; if you've ever seen Luther live, you can imagine the whole show.Luther's was the voice of loneliness. He sings his truth and wears his desperate heart on his tuxedo sleeve on two of his most famous ballads on this CD; A House Is Not A Home and Superstar.Apart from being the balladeer of our generation (and the Sinatra of Soul), Luther returns to his disco/funky roots at times; the Le Freak-ish version of Creepin' is worth the price of admission alone !!"
5,5 times is a charm,After I heard Luther had died the radio station did a all day tribute to this giant of a man I heard House is not a Home and I knew that I wanted the live version an that would be his last concert on earth...Thank you for being so fast in sending it to me cause perhaps he is dancing an singing with his Father for eternity....Tell Others Please...Edie
4,Luther Vocally but something is Missing,like a Artist that you know brings it Live is how you place Luther in that Group of Artists you know who can take it to the stage.but somehow for me I wish this had have dropped oh about 12-15 years ago during Luther's Prime time run.Vocally He still is Luther though you can sense something may be off a bit.some songs are missing&this should have been a Double Disc Easily.but His Voice alone makes this worth seeking out.
2,Too Short,"When I heard of a live release from Luther I was thrilled,but when it was finally released I was amazed at how short it is. It was so short I didn't buy it. I thought it was going to be amazing like Patti labelle's double live disc. Yes, this is a great performance. His voice is amazing as always. I gave it a 2 stars because of how short it is. I think it's an insult to Luther's fans that it is so short. My advice is buy Luther live on DVD. The DVD is not as long as it should,but you get to see Luther at his best."
4,"Wake up, Luther!","He's like Cordelia on ANGEL now.He's there, but not really.Still his rendition of ""Superstar"" puts that lardbutt Reuben to shame."
4,Good Luther,"This is ok. For some reason of allmy Luther, this wasnt as Great as i expected. Could be longer with more songs and is about an 80%.I expected more just looking at the cover.Not Bad, just Not as Super as I ecpected. Buy the Wembly Stadium Live show Its Just what you want and Superb Live."
5,Luther Live is incomparable,"I am probably preaching to the converted here but I saw Luther live four times and on each occasion he was just phenomenal - better live than on the original recordings.This is a fantastic CD but you should also getLive at Wembleywhich I feel is an even better performance overall (slightly less power, but even more subtlety and a playlist that hangs together better).I'm grateful I got to see him and that we can enjoy performances like these forever - there won't be another Luther."
4,A BEAUTIFUL NOVEL,"This spare novel of a young woman who infiltrates an all-male geologists' camp in northern Canada uses the technique of rotating narrators pioneered by Faulkner in As I Lay Dying to achieve a wonderfully multi-dimensional evocation of the main character. Though certain of the peripheral characters, notably Jerome and Milton, never break free of caricature, the novel is made profound, and rereadable, by the strength, honesty and uniqueness of J.L. I completely fell in love with her. You will too."
1,"Not actually a film, just a slideshow","My fiancee and I will be traveling to Morocco for our honeymoon in October, so we were excited to check out what was advertised as a ""documentary"" about various cities in the country. Much to our dismay, what we purchased was a 45 minute slideshow of someone's trip to Morocco that looks like a poorly made PowerPoint presentation. There is no narration, just some text that is very small and difficult to read. Needless to say, we did not watch the entire thing and felt that even though we only lost $1.99, it was a waste of money. The description needs to be updated to state that it is simply a slideshow, otherwise potential viewers like me will likely be disappointed."
5,Very Comforting !,"After the loss of my daughter (28 yrs. old) unexpectedly, I read this book and it answered so many questions that I was asking in my head. I found comfort in this book and I re-read chapters occasionally when I need to."
3,CREEPY BOOK!!!,"I feel that Patrick Mathews really has a heart for the living and the dead. I kind of question whether or not his work is for real or for entertainment, considering the fact he primarily worked in the entertainment business, before ""discovering"" he was a medium. He also kind of creeped me out when he was saying that dogs have spirits, and the ""signs"" that our loved ones are near us. I don't know, I guess you would have to judge for yourselves!"
5,Thank you Patrick!,"I checked out this book at the Library after hearing about Patrick's appearances on local TV and Radio shows. After reading it, I am purchasing a copy to keep, as I know I will read this book over and over.I have read two other books on this subject and found this one easy to both read and understand. Patrick's gift is amazing to say the least. His accounts of readings for people all over the world would make even a skeptic think twice, and if you are open to this, like I am, his experiences will serve to convince you that communication with loved ones, once they leave this physical life, can be achieved. I spoke with Patrick on the radio this morning before writing the review, and I can tell you that the messages he brought to me were right on the mark...all of them. I'm a believer."
5,This is...,"One of several books I have read on Mediums. It was fascinating and it encouraged me to believe in spirits and made death not as scary to me. I really enjoyed Patrick Matthews' real life stories and he has helped to make me a believer. Try it...you just might change your mind or at the least, find some peace about death."
5,loved it,Really enjoyed reading this book I read it in tandem with his new book forever with you great author. Found them very comforying
5,Excellent Reading,I read this book twice within the first week of receiving it - and it was great! Patrick is a wonderful and compassionate writer!
2,Sturdy,A really good price but these shoes are not very comfortable. Pity the man that wears them all day; I use them to do occasional yard work. The are sturdy and have a thick steel toe. The shoe laces are WAY too long and I have to double knot to take up the slack.
5,Never saw a sweeter movie!,"I agree fully with the reviewer from Bakersfield.Internet Movie Database provided links to a source who could give me a NTSC copy for about $50. However, with compatible software and hardware you can see this PAL version in your computer monitor. This particular PAL version is technically (color and crispness of picture) much better than what I saw on television years ago.This PAL region 2 version (just a few copies) is available in Amazon. I am sure more copies are available somewhere else.If you copy the DVD to your computer hard drive (it is not copy-protected) you can play it with Nero Showtime and a compatible monitor, in my case, a Viewsonic VX922.The picture in this version is crisp and the color is gorgeous!"
5,Real,"I lived in northern Alabama for six years during the '60s, which doesn't make me an expert on the South but enough of one to know this story rings true. More than that, the main characters talk to each other like real people do -- there are no cliches here.It's been a while since I've seen ""Tender Mercies"" but I'd say this film ranks right up there with it in regard to realism."
1,A Waste Of Money!!,I watched the whole series 5 yrs ago & i loved it. I ordered this dvd for mycollection but got disappointed when i found out no English subtitles available.
1,Cuando Seas Mia,"Just one word: disapointed. They cut so many important part of the story. I saw this production in TV and is very good, but the DVD kill the drama because is like a summary but a very bad summary."
1,"A Great ""Disapointment""","The novela Cuando seas Mia on sale at Amazon, is a condensed version. Don't waste your money. The Unabriged version, by TV Azteca, is a grate production, and I Hope some day, it goes on sale. Who ever thougth it was agood deal to put on sale an ""abriged version"" of it, Is a compleate scam.I've seen most of the original novela, TV Azteca has put on tv for about three times already, unfortunately, I had never been able to see it in it's whole. Lets hope somebody brigthens up and come up with the entire version of Cuando Seas Mia, and I mean chapter by chapter, even if we have to pay a little bit more. Again, this condensed version is a complete disapoinment, almost half of the chapters are missing, and those who buy it will not get whats going on, especially those like me who have seen the ""real good Stuf"""
1,Emabarrassed,"Great story, my whole family LOVED the series. For Christmas a few years ago I bought at Best Buy for myself, my sister, and my mother- SO excited! Turned into SO embarrassed when my own mother called to say it was all chopped up. GRRRR;/ Super short version that doesn't even make sense. WHY???? I got my sisters copy back and never opened mine. So sad. Yes I should have read the number of minutes but who does that(?)- I do now. And somewhere on the packaging should have said in BIG BOLD letters ""Edited.....NOT THE ENTIRE VERSION, NOT EVEN CLOSE."""
3,agh!,"Well, after reviewing several reviews, I must agree with the fact that yes, this is a quite an edited version of the novela. I found it at my local library and picked up to watch and sure enough, I was very disappointed with the chopping of the series. It totally skips crucial pieces of the story! Like when Diego is telling Paloma that he is leaving to London and will return in a years time. Well, if you don't mind missing out on the whole story and don't really know it all, then maybe this series is for you, otherwise, I would just rent it at the local dvd store or library."
2,Not worth it,This is a snap lock stove pipe but I never was able to snap it or lock it. Took me hours and a lot of swearing to figure out how to keep em connected. Wish I would of bought somewhere local.
3,Music Lovers' Encyclopedia...,"The standard reference book on all music -- revised, up-to-date, with complete pronouncing biographical dictionary of composers and musicians; authoritative essays on all major figures; dictionary of musical terms. Special section gives synposes of 90 operas, plus articles on such personalities as Cesar Franck, Wagner, Sullivan, Gershwin, Sibelius, Stravinsky and many others. A remarkable book of endless information and interest."
4,NLCM5&1,"Not your average boring chess game (although it does contain a well executed normal chess game for those who want that kind of thing)Using the voice of HAL the computer taunts you & cheats whenever possible. Good graphics & sound, good flow in the game, unexpected surprises here & there (think Montey Python type humor)not an epic game but fun to play."
3,Adequate...,"I've been playing guitar for 25 years now and have only recently started fooling around on the bass. It took me all of one day to get through 2/3 of the book. However, the author does offer some useful explanations of proper technique and the exercises are good practice. Also having the CD included is a nice touch.Still I think anybody other than a complete novice with no experience at all will quickly outgrow this book."
2,good for a younger crowd,"all i pretty much learned was the musical alphabet and some chords/arpeggios in this book. the rest of the book is just tabs. i would recommend this for a younger crowd, but as for myself, i started using free online resources and they showed me the same things i learned in this book."
1,Bass Teaching Book for Bass Pros,"This book stinks. It takes for granted that you know certain things that most begginers don't know. Its also very small and doesn't even cover Scales. It didn't help me at all and got me frustrated. It tells you to do things but it doesn't tell you how to pull them off, like technique. Also it is a very ""closed"" book and doesn't offer any styles besides the norm. I definitely don't recommend."
2,Need more explanations,"This book probably was written for absolute beginners. The book is only 40 pages long and spends 15 of its pages on background information on how to read notes, tabs, and on how to hold and pick a bass guitar. If you're a guitar player, you probably know most of this already. The rest of the book is a play along to the CD with no explanation why a particular note was chosen to start and to end on. So you can't really create your own bass line for different songs even after you complete the lessons. It's a short book so you can go through the material in few days. If you had no exposure to music in the past, this book will start you off and help you become familier with the instrument. If you are looking to learn more, perhaps books on bass by Berklee school of music is a better deal."
3,Almost but not quite ---- no cigar !,"The other reviewers have glossed over the fact that Rhino has put out a package of a limited number of episodes. But to those of us who are full ""Wyatt Earp"" fans why could we not have the same treatment as most of the other classic TV shows have received ... that is, release Season 1, then Season 2, etc all in their entirety and in episodic order. This show was broadcast from 1955 to 1961 ... Rhino has thrown us a bone instead of the seven-course meal we deserve. The quality is good ... big deal ... now many of us have to continue to sit back and wait for someone to ""do it correctly"" ... it may never happen ... but Hugh O'Brian and the gang, including us fans, deserve better."
5,The life and legend of Wyatt Earp.,If you are a fan of Wyatt Earp this is a must to have in your western collection. Picture and sound are great. The movie is done the correct way even up to the shoot out. Like I said this is a must...
4,Wyatt Earp - the TV series,Wonderful nostalgia for anyone in the 50s and over. Good stories and great quality pictures considering the episodes were made in the 1950s. Highly recommended (and I wish they would make more the 267 episodes available on DVD).
3,"Iggy&The Stooges - 'Studio Sessions,1972 Demos' (Pilot)","Another collection for all you Iggy/Stooges die hards.Ten power house cuts from rehearsal tapes that were recorded sometime in 1972.Sound is acceptable.Tunes that made me want to smash stuff up in the street were ""Death Trip"",""I Got A Right"",""Rubber Legs"" and a track that I don't remember,""Pin Point Eyes"".Wait...a minute.That song is on the 'Wild Love' disc(see my review)."
1,Don't waste your money!,"There are a total of 12 DVDs (some available only on Time Life or ebay) in this series. Some of the volumes are definitely worth the money...but some of them are not! Unfortunately, volume two is NOT one of the GOOD volumes. It is boring, listless, and to me, not worth anything. I am a huge country music fan, and have been all my life...but the songs and performers on this album were not very interesting or entertaining to say the least. I wasn't surprised to find that the other person who wrote a review said that they didn't like this volume either. Save your money and buy something else."
5,i really hope i bought this for my mom,"if not i have no explanation to why i purchased this. the movie is good, plays well on a dvd player"
4,Very informative / maybe too much,"This edition of Human Factors Engineering is a brilliant read. It uses excellent examples that play out the content in story based scenarios. My only criticism is that it may be a bit too informative, meaning there is so much information it is kind of a whirlwind to read through. This however may contribute to its use in a widespread industry where the reader may be an engineer, architect, digital/clothing designer, etc. Great book and I recommend it to anyone interested in Human Factors Design."
3,"Valuable introduction and future resource to Human Factors,","Informative presentation of basic Human Factors principles from a psychology perspective. Touches on Cognition, Perception, and the Design Process. The last of which is extremely valuable for any UI design. Handy reference tool."
5,Good classic Babar,"Even if read from a modern perspective, there's still a lot of good to be taken away from the book. Very different from most American books for children, it's very sad at times, but, eh bien, c'est la vie!"
1,Can't Change Combination,Look at other reviews on other sites and within Amazon for this and similar models. You can NOT change the combo from 0-0-0 no matter what you try. This a bug that they have never fixed and that is the only reason these are on the market so cheap. They are simply dumping and selling thousands of units that do NOT function properly when it comes to changing the combo . . . and good thieves know that.
3,"Good, but not his best....","I loved homeland and was a little disappointed in American Dreams....The characters are great, his writing is great, but something wasn't there....I am still a big fan of john jakes...."
3,Lacks depth,"Although I enjoyed the book, I was disappointed by its lack of depth. I felt the book made for easy reading, but lacked the usually Jakes detail of the time, characters, and story."
2,Not worth it,"What a true disappointment...this book was long awaited, since Homeland was a mark of acheivement. Unlike Homeland, The North & South Trilogy, California Gold and the Kent Family Chronicles (I'm a Jakes FAN!), this book lost its steam before it even started. The only interesting focus was that of Paul Crown and his assistant, as they filmed WWI. Everything else was a drab attempt at trying to give the other characters interesting lives. There was too much jumping around, and not enough of character growth/evolution. Stagnant and wimpy, a real downer.Will heartily recommend any other book by Jakes...he's my History Man!"
2,Disappointed,"After reading ""Homeland"", I eagerly awaited the next installment of what Jakes had promised would be a trilogy. Now, however, I don't care if there is a third volume or not. Each novel by Jakes has kept me transfixed; I couldn't put them down, but ""Homeland"" is entirely predictable with no climax. I couldn't decide whether Jakes was bored with the subject or simply rushing to finish the story. His subjects are usually engrossing and the saga of the Crown family uniquely American, I am just very, very disappointed. Please, Mr. Jakes don't write again until you regain your passion!"
5,American Dreams,The condition of the paperback was excellent; it appeared to be new although it was listed as used. Like all of Jakes historical novels this one was excellent.
4,Good Read,"Enjoyed reading the contiuation of the Crown family saga in America. Ending seemed to be open for another continuation of the story even though this was the second and last book in the series. Would suggest that your read the first book ""Homeland"" before reading the second one, ""American Dreams"". Have read other books by John Jakes and I enjoyed these more than some of his others."
4,good book but derivitive,"it's impossible to hate any john jakes book. american dreams is not one of john jakes' best, but it's still a very good read, and would be among most authors' best novels. however, jakes' biggest problem is that he doesn't really focus on one character like he did with paul in ""homeland"" or philip in the ""bastard."" he has 3 or 4 main characters in the book, which is just too many. it would have been nice to focus a whole book on carl, who seems to be the most likable character in the book. fritzi is obvioulsy a derivitive chararter who draws an all to striking resemblance to elanor kent, who was also an actress. jakes seems to be running out of stories, and seems to have copied a lot from the kent family chronicles and just transfered it to this book. however, it's still a solid book, and is worth reading."
2,Not his best.,"I am a lifelong reader of John Jakes. I enjoyed the Kent Family books and The North and South trilogy. However, this book lacks Jakes rhythmic writing style and good storytelling; this book is not interesting. This book is intended to be volume II of a three volume series. At the ending of American Dreams, Jakes more or less has shut the door on these characters. Jakes last good book was North and South."
3,"A good book, but not his best","After reading the rest of Jakes' historical fiction, I was prepared for this one to be just as intense and detailed. While the book is informative, and does move smartly along plot wise, I felt that the book lacked the depth of plot and character development that his earlier books had. I look forward to the next installment in this series, and hope that Mr. Jakes returns to his previous depth of devlopment as regards to character and plto."
4,Another historical masterpiece by Jakes,"I want to rebut the reviews that this book was ""not up to Jakes' usual par"". Readers have criticized the ""lack of depth"", ""shallow characters"", and so on, but I felt that the fast pace of this book was in perfect rhythym with the brisk historical pace of the early 20th century. All of the characters were real and believable and I fell in love with Carl the man that I adored like a puppy in ""Homeland""."
3,"Not his best, but still a solid story","The good news is that this book is better than 90% of the historical fiction on the market... the bad news is that this was not Jakes' best work. It is hard to feel the same passion for the Crowns that you did for the Kents or Hazzards. Some of the writing just seems a bit tired. His villians are not quite as evil, his romances not quite as exciting and the overall pace just a bit short of fascinating. The history, however, is terrific as always. The research he must do is painstaking but it adds so much to the story. This is what seperates Jakes from te rest of the pack and still makes this an above average book."
5,whoa,"This book can be viewed - and has been viewed by other reviewers - in two ways. As a fictional novel, it is excellent, by far Quinn's best - out of the 4 that I have read. As a work advancing the messages and theories of Quinn that his readers have come to love and expect, it will not satisfy people. This is not because Quinn tries and fails, but because he aims for something different: a beautiful and thrilling novel with subtle messages - that still make the reader think. This book proves to me that Quinn is not only a visionary, but a brilliant writer capable of weaving intriguing storylines with complex - yet not overly-distracting - messages. Superb."
5,Deeper and Deeper...,"""The Holy"" is not to be taken at face value. To do so is to ruin the amazing opening to another ""sight"" that ""The Holy"" presents to us all.There are much deeper issues and feelings running through this work of art than most will notice.Take note, ""The Holy"" is not so much of a story in the similar vein as his first three famous books.Yet it is....I personally felt that ""The Holy"" was a wonderful experience and I treasure the time that I spent reading it.I could spend all sorts of energy explaining every nuance of ""The Holy"" to you, but I won't.If you want to open your being to yet another exciting and truthful story, read ""The Holy"""
2,The Holy,"This book was so promising, and it began strong, with some interesting stuff going on and a good storyline. It just didn't pan out. The second half did not deliver."
1,muddled confusing and not worth the effort,"Being a HUGE fan of Mr. Quinn's, and loving and re-reading everything else he's ever written. I feel compelled to ask ""WHAT THE [HECK]!"" I found myself reading and re-reading whole chapters and not only being bored to death, but confused and angry that I was wasting so much of my time on this drivel. This is truly...bad. I should've stopped reading after the scene with the devil worshipper and the main character going through a barbarella-logan's run-esque debauchery. Shame on you Mr. Quinn. Very very dissappointed. AND I want those hours I spent reading this back."
1,Cut out the middle,"The first 70 and last 20 pages are worth reading. Skip the rest. The book is less about ""old gods"" and more about a private investigator and a boy trying to find his dad. When the final 20 pages DO arrive, it's unsurprisingly alike the themes in Ishmael. Quinn is apparently a one-trick pony."
3,Quinn for Goth Kids,"The Holy is the flip-side of The Story of B. For every hidden stone B shines a light on, The Holy takes an underside peek. This is not an easy book to read for Cheery Optimists like myself-there is more blood, death, pain, and terror than in all Quinn's other books combined, yet in the end it's still the same world Quinn's been showing us since Ishmael.That said, The Holy doesn't quite live up to its own expectations (the glowing self-review on the dust-jacket, for example). It's not as plodding as After Dachau, but it could have lost fifty or a hundred pages somewhere. Too much of the action is spoon-fed, and Quinn has yet to improve his characterizations of children (think My Ishmael).Check this book out if you're looking for a great, epic horror ride-check out Quinn's first half dozen books if you'd rather rest on the brighter side."
3,Falls short of expectations,"I've been a big Daniel Quinn fan since reading ""Ishmael."" But this novel was a disappointment. The first time I attempted to finish it, I stopped about three quarters of the way through because it just got too strange. I started again with an open mind, and finished it, but was not pleased with the book as a whole. Quinn is an excellent writer, but I felt with this book, he was trying too hard to make a simple point. He takes us through an extraordinary journey, which is far from believable, and by the time he gets to his point, I was too perplexed to care. If you practice a religion, such as Wicca, anamism, or Satanism, that Christians would scoff at, perhaps this would be a refreshing read because of its defense of such religions. Otherwise, it's not really worth your time."
1,This is no Ishmael,"The first thing a perspective reader needs to know about this book is that it has nothing in common with Ishmael. You wouldn't even guess that it was written by the same author. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case it is. This is a ""metaphysical thriller"" according to the front jacket. Well, it is neither a thriller nor particularly metaphysical. The story is very superficial and unbelievable. The reader follows along through a series of story lines that lead nowhere with the thought that all will be revealed at some point. But no, the book simply ends with no enlightenment given, no story told, no insights gained, no pleasure taken. It is an empty, poorly executed book that will sell because the author has a following from earlier works that were profound and meaningful. This one isn't."
3,Only One Packet of Good Stuff.,"Mountain House makes Great freeze dried food in my opinion (if you cook it right) and I would give the product 5 stars! The problem is, at the time of my purchase the add said it was for a case if these pouches and I only received one. This is a ok price for one, about $2 more than what I sometimespay at local stores but I thought I had found a deal. It wasn't worth sending it back. Note: When you cook these meals be sure to mix everything up really good so you don't get a bite of dried food. Also, let it cook for as long as possible! I usually put tge bag near the fire after adding the hot water and in the cold you'll want to insulate it at best or dump it in a pot and let it cook over your fire/stove. Good Stuff on the trail!"
2,Meh,"Not horrible and would be just fine if there was nothing else but this bag o' chili-mac is not for those with a sensitive stomach. I can take a lot of spice but this meal, which is not spicy, sat in my belly like a brick, not to mention leaving aftertaste that lasted long after I brushed my teeth with baking soda. Twice."
2,Chili mac in a ziploc can't be a good idea,"Not horrible and would be just fine if there was nothing else but this bag o' chili-mac is not for those with a sensitive stomach. I can take a lot of spice but this meal, which is not spicy, sat in my belly like a brick, not to mention leaving aftertaste that lasted long after I brushed my teeth with baking soda. Twice.If you're looking for something to stock up on for WTSHTF, avoid this."
5,Another top flight effort by Ed Calle!,"Once again Ed Calle, That multitalented woodwind player, rises above the competition and shows the world who's the best. Ed's talent as an arranger and composer can't be overlooked here. From Motown to Miami Ed can do it all. This CD should be part of any serious Jazz fan's collection. I can't wait for the next release!!!!"
3,A Fun Summer Read,"I was looking for some kitsch to escape from my dreary law school textbooks and this was just the thing. Some of the cultural references are a little vague to the modern reader, but then again, I found it somewhat insightful into the ""gay panic"" of the fifties. I suggest buying two from the series, though. This was a quick read and left me bookless all too early."
5,Good compilation of information on ultrasound induced cavitation,This book gave me a head-start before I could dig deeper into the literature. Seems quite thorough on the available theories and experimental observations regarding cavitation in ultrasonic fields.
2,It's not nearly as pretty in real life.,The stone is way more yellow and less November birthstone in real life. I never wear it because it's just not that pretty in real life.
3,Sent Wrong Size but Good Reeds,"My husband is very particular about his reeds and this is the only brand he will use, but there are next to impossible to find in our area. So we ordered all the company had to offer. While the reeds are excellent quality, they were not all the size that was advertised. Some were alto and some were tenor. Luckily, my husband has both so we were able to use them, but this may not be the case for everyone."
5,Beautiful additons,"The Egg and Dart solid natural brass backplates were a beautiful addition to my front entrance door. In fact, they absolutely create fantastic curb appeal. My door is an older door that I have painted several times but when I added the 8"" brass backplates, the door looked straight out of a magazine.The Egg & Dart design on the backplates looks very authetic and the brass is thick and will last as long as the door will.I am very pleased with the product. The price was excellent as well as the quick shipping--a very pleasant online transaction."
3,not a REAL insider's guide,"I found Steinberg's account interesting for a reporter's perspective -- he somewhat lionizes the director who from all accounts is a typical ""try to do the right thing"" type of guy. However, after reading about 10 college guides, I have to conclude that the only real ""insider's"" guide I've read is ... written by a real admissions officer, not a reporter parrotting what admissions officers want him to see. Parents will learn something about the process, but if they want to know real details and a true insider's perspectives, hernandez's book is the real groundbreaking one, with Howard Greene a close second. This book is solid, but nothing really new. Even the term Gatekeepers was coined by a NY Post writer who used A is for Admission's results for the term."
2,Boring book about boring job.,Boring book about a boring job. Another article stretched out into a book. Still in all well-researched and obviously appeals to some.
4,The Gatekeepers,"Being a retired director of admissions having worked at three independent colleges and a public university, I am interested in reading books dealing with admissions offices. ""The Gatekeepers"" is well written, an interesting read, and appears to be carefully researched and a fairly accurate depiction of the operation of a rather selective admissions office."
4,Great Story !!!,The book is filled with great stories. I loved how the author detailed every event. It was like being there experiencing the strange phenomenon of Virginia City. Great work. Can't wait for your next book.
5,WOW!,"My husband and I visited Virginia City a few yrs ago during our trip to Lake Tahoe. What wonderful memories Mr Bruns' book brings back. We saw a few of the places he mentions but now we want to go back! We wish we had his book BEFORE our trip!Not only is it intriguing, but you can learn a lot about the history of the area , too.This is just great!"
5,I'm Impressed!,"I found myself thoroughly engrossed in this book and the writer's style, though I don't usually read that much history. It was engaging and entertaining and I've recommended it to several friends, who enjoyed it as well (come on, guys, write reviews!). I hope all of you out there who have even a tiny interest in paranormal experiences pick up this book and give it a read. It's great!"
5,Impressive Thriller,"I picked this book up on a whim and it blew me away. I got the second, and now I have the third as well. The author speaks from experience. His characters are compelling and believable. He manages to keep the reader teetering somewhere between tense and suspense, and then blows you out of your seat! If you're a geek, if you like sex, drugs, video games, comic books, and high-tech con-artists; if you like situations where it becomes hard to figure out whose conning whom, then this book is worth a read!"
4,Just plain fun,"This book was just a fun read. It's a mix of light-tech hacker crime with some mild espionage / spy elements, or maybe the other way around. While the author seems to be aiming for the self-proclaimed geek crowd, the story is more than accessible to the non-geek. I think the average reader would be more thrown off by the constant barrage of comic book references than the tech details.The writing style is a tad plain, and the book felt a little jumpy and unfocussed at times, but I can say (being careful not to spoil anything) that everything does fit together in the end. It just may not seem like it at the time. So, when you get the the third or fourth gear change in the book and are wondering where in the world things are going, just try that the author is taking it somewhere fun and just let yourself enjoy the moments as they come.Overall, I highly recommend Geek Mafia as a short, fun, geeky read."
4,Great Read and actually believable,"I was looking for a computer geek novel to read on a recent business trip and found this series. The story starts off strong and grabs you at the beginning to never let go. The characters, setting and plots are believable with a good imagination which makes it that much better of a read.The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is the over use of the F word. Call me a prude but it's inserted all throughout the book where no such vulgarity impact is needed to keep you on story."
3,Robin Hood and the Grifters,"Eh. Thieves are still thieves even if they are tech savvy and only go after those who ""deserve it."""
3,Don't take me too seriousley,"I only started to read the sample. Don't get me wrong, it was good. It took all my willpower to stop reading.In my opinion, a book that drops the F bomb twice in the first chaper isn't worth it."
5,Double your fun with Full Moon Soup and Full Moon Afloat!,"I read these books with both younger sons for years and we loved them. It's amazing how many times you can ""read"" one of the books and yet find something you had never noticed before. Such a neat way to engage young children in books. We would make up our own stories and the boys would try to best each other in finding the most unusual happening on each page. If you buy one I'm sure you'll want the other. Very, very enjoyable!"
5,Wonderful!,"I loved this book-- it's so detailed and the way the plot lines interact is fascinating. I've ""read"" it a dozen times, and found something new each time."
3,It doesn't.,"I recommend this book for those who are not familiar withCreationists' ignorance, lies, and deceit--- this book isa fine example. The author demonstrates a complete lackof understanding of what science is and what it does. Thisbook is for True Believers: it is not a serious attemptat applying science to ""divine creation."""
2,Creationists quoting creationists,"Some people refuse to accpet valid theories based on degrees of certainty. With certainty this book pretends to do science in the name of God, through faith. The burden of proof, of course, is still with the thiest and this book only holds them back by trying to explain the unexplainble through reason and logic using faith."
5,Top notch book against evolutionism,"This is destined to become a classic text AGAINST evolutionism. Camp has assembled an amazing number of excellent quotations by leading scientists, not just creationists, which show clearly the weakness of Darwinism. I have found it most useful in combatting this pernicious evil. It shows also that ""Intelligent people believe in evolution because they have been told that intelligent people believe in evolution."" Few have actually examined the evidences supporting the theory.Bill Carrell"
5,Almost like being there!,"After visiting Italy for the first time, and falling in love with Venice, I wanted to find a coffee table book that captured my memories of such a magical city. I looked at several books, but this is the only one that gave me pictures of the scenes I remember -- the secret alleyways of the city that lead to gorgeous pockets of beauty, like a hidden courtyard, or flowers spilling off a trellis, viewed from a bridge. Not too text-heavy, this is a must-own for any Venice-phile."
3,Crystal Reports 8.0,"This book covers in depth regarding how to create rpt files and concepts. Useful book for report designers and administrators.If you are a ASP/VB/C developer developing web reports using crystal reports you may not find detailed technical information. No code samples are given for ASP/VB/C developers.However, this book is a good reference for anyone wants to know about crystal reports."
2,"Very basic, so this book should be in the For dummies series","This book is intended for someone new to computer science. For example the book spend many pages explaining what is a database, what is a DSN (Data Source) and how to configure it in Windows...Keep looking please!"
4,Excellent analysis of the occult in Hollywood movies......,"I'm amazed at all the movies that were shown in this documentary and the symbolism involved. I'm sure there are many, many others but this is an excellent and particularly sinister cross section. Thank you for taking the time to point all of this out and put all of it together in a cohesive manner!"
2,Overpriced Table,This table should not be bought. I got it as a young bachelor a few years ago. If you want something to class up your place a bit go to K-mart and get a nicer table for cheaper. This table showed up to my house in a box. You would think the box would have protected it but there was already a large scrape on the table before it was actually boxed up. One of my chairs' backs broke while I was pulling it out to sit down. The seat cushions have all become incredibly stained just from sitting on them. The chairs on either side cannot be pushed in fully because they will run in to each other and only allow one side to be fully under the table (on the long side.) Pass up this opportunity. The price of this table and chairs was also $100 less when I bought them. Certainly not at all worth over $300 now. This is also not a cappuccino finish. It was pure black.
3,Cross ATX Fountain Pen,"Pen felt good but the ink flowed too quickly and didn't dry fast enough. I returned the pen. Maybe a ""Fine"" nib instead of ""Medium"" would have been better, but I doubt it would dry quick enough.."
3,Overpriced and Overrated,"This is the only disc that I own in this cycle, and I shall not be purchasing any of the others. While these performances are good and well recorded, they simply do not approach, let alone surpass, the performance of these symphonies by Paavo Järvi conducting the Bremen German Chamber Philharmonic. If you think Vänskä and the Minnesota Orchestra are something special, wait until you hear Järvi and his Germans. Järvi is better recorded, better performed, and cheaper."
4,Cold As Ice!,"These are monster killers! No, feelings at all; just what they can eat off of you. They are disgusted killers form from a malfunction unhuman planet."
5,The best album of her career!!!,Sasha has always recorded good music but with Once Once she did an excellent job. Is the best album of her career!
5,once once sasha sokol,"wonderful musicians and excelent performer, she interpreted everysong with a great sensibility,she is just great, i wonder when she is going to have a new cd, because this one i alredy have it."
2,I didn't enjoy it...,"The trilogy continues with the saga of Shawna and David. Secrets abound in this book - who is pregnant?, who was pregnant?, who slept with whom?. Too many secrets and a poorly developed plot ruined this book. The secrets never seemed worth keeping, causing the whole premise of the book to crumble. I also hate this author's trademark forced seductions. Can't her heroines ever maturely realize that they would like to sleep with the hero. The occassional forced seduction can be quite sexy (see The Well Pleasured Lady), but this author uses the template again and again in all her novels. I did not enjoy this book and do not recommend it."
2,Too Many Secrets and Immature Behaviour,"This book is full of secrets about babies and pregnancies and affairs and religious groups, etc... It was too much for me. This book is trademark Shannon Drake - with cliches designed to build tension, forced seductions, shrewish heroines, etc... If you like those types of activities, then read the book. However, if you like a poignant journey to love between mature adults, pass this book up."
4,A great read!,I enjoyed reading this book. It kept me entertained throughout the novel. It was very suspenseful and mysterious. I was very excited to find out how the mystery unfolds and the relationship between Douglas and Shawna kept me riveted.
2,Very Disappointing!,"This book just didn't fit in the trilogy. We went from American soil and the escalating Indian problems, to some weird satanic cult in Scotland. The author tried to make a ""who fathered this child"" mystery throughout the book, and yet it was so glaringly obvious what was going on. The plot wasn't that believable and the whole time you just wanted to know what was going to happen back in America with the characters from the first book."
1,WORST EVER!!!,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! I ordered the king version and it is horrible. I want my money back!!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 1259.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. They are not a member of the BBB in MA, so foget trying to report them.WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
1,More than I can say!!,"Don't look at the ad's picture because you would love it. At first time I met it, I think it's a wrong item which I ordered. After I checked it, Oh!!..is it a mattress?. It composes of 2 pieces of foam, one junky pillow, and one bed sheet. It's not worthy of purchasing it even $199."
3,no directions,"I ordered this queen mattress to use in my camper, and the price was great @ $199.00, however I was disappointed when it arrived as it came with no real ""packaging"" from the manufacturer, just sheets of clear plastic held together by about 10 rolls of packing tape! also there were no directions on assembling it and no markings on the pieces to tell you which pad went on the bottom and which one was for the top. I think I figured it out, I hope I did it right! All in all it seems to be pretty comfy, and compared to the alternative of paying $500 for an ""rv"" mattress, I'm mostly satisfied with my purchase."
2,comfy but smells like chemicals,I believe it's called off-gassing when a chemical breaks down and releases gas into the air. As I fall asleep I can't help but worry about the cancers I'm giving myself.Aside from that the mattress is comfortable and shipping was prompt.
1,Exceedingly Disappointed,"I found the content of this book to be completely appalling. To me, the book suggested ways to ""manipulate"" your spouse by couching it in terms of ""salting"" to get what you want. Shameful. There are too many other books available to help strengthen marriages without learning to manipulate your spouse. I would never recommend this book to anyone. If you want a good book to help strengthen a marriage, try ""What Every Woman Desires"" instead."
4,Ordering a Replacement Copy,"When I first read the book, before my husband and I were even married, it helped our relationship a great deal (by helping me change my outlook on several areas of our relationship). We have been married almost three years now and everything is great! I find myself remembering parts of the book from time to time and wishing I could read it again.I would recommend this book to anyone, whether your marriage is great or having problems."
3,"Has interesting ideas, but focused on 50's life style.","The book has some interesting (biblically based) insights on how to improve your marriage that are not totally without merit. As a Full-time employee, wife, and mother I found some of the ideas a bit too old fashioned. It seemed like the author was basing his book on the fact that most women are stay at home wives and mothers. I couldn't relate to much of what it had to offer because of that."
2,Most people dislike this one,"I own TONS of Firm Videos and DVDs ... I own everything The FIRM. I love them! B U T I do not like this one. The work out is good, but she's not very charming and so its not fun to do. Janet Jones FIRM video or anything by Susan Harris are much better. Plus the workout from Jones or Harris are far better (which I know they didn't construct, but I'm using their names for definition).So... I feel bad giving this one a bad review, but it is the one FIRM tape that I am willing to throw out. 2 friends of mine tried it and did not want to keep it, but they liked the others.That's it. The instructor is disagreeable. I am glad others like her, because I'm sure she's a nice person. Her body is perfect, so that's a good sign that it works!"
3,Hard To Explain,This album is different because they tried to stay the same.The freshness and charm of the first ep and LP is now gone.Replaced by slower tempos and cheesy keyboard sounds. Where is the great bassline of Is This It? Where did the guitar interplay and nervous tension go? Maybe they sacked Nigel Godrich because he wanted them to move forward instead of fallng backwards.At least they didn't make Drew Barrymore an exe(cute)tive producer.Not bad but hardly essential.
1,Nothing New,"all i have to say is that if you have the strokes first album then you have a copy of this one too. Their is nothing different at all. very disapointing since I liked their last album. But if i want to listen to it i can put it in the CD player, I don't have to go out and pay money for the same album with different titles. If you like the strokes than it's good album it's just nothing new."
5,BEST CD! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!,"There are albums that are good. There are albums that are great. There are albums with a few good songs.But this one tops them all.I have never heard a better album by anyone, though the other Strokes album ""Is This It"" comes close. As few the songs are, they are all magnificent. Brilliant. It's audio gold.Any more need to be said?If you'll bother to read this, bother to buy the album."
2,Room of So Whats,"Will somebody please by Julian a microphone? After three days of being forced to listen to this by a Strokes nut at my job, I am ready to give these unimaginative 80's new wave thieves some decent equipment out of my own pocket. But then again, they'd probably spend more time trying to pose with it than figure out the proper use for it. Another band that makes the phrase ""Don't Believe The Hype"" relevant. At least you can HEAR what the White Stripes are singing. Dreadful and mundane, this."
3,the sophomore slump,"Since the songs are so stylistically similar to those on their debut, I can't review this album without comparing it to the former. Unfortunately their current effort isn't as good. The Strokes stick to the formula that made their first album such a success, yet the songs just aren't as catchy. Don't get me wrong, this is a good album and a solid sophomore effort by a band that I love, however if you're expecting ""Is this it"", this one isn't."
5,Addictive...,"I'm into rock like the White Stripes and Jet, and when I first bought Room on Fire, having never listened to Is This It, I feared it would turn out to be a totally computer-created boy band sort of thing. I didn't know how wrong I was (although there are some sound effects from computers on a few of the tracks, which I hate). The Strokes are really a great band. And while ""Automatic Stop,"" ""12:51,"" and ""You Talk Way Too Much"" are, in my opinion, probably the best ones on here, the disc is packed with catchy melodies and lyrics. Not to mention they're addictive-I can't stop listening to this album. All in all, a very exceptional album from what seems to be a mediocre band."
4,Is This It -- part 2,"With their second release, The Strokes have once again managed to keep modern rock on life support with an uncompromising, full-tilt record complete with Julian's trademark distorted vocals and some confident takes on the classic rock vibe from the rest of the band. The songwriting is almost identical to Is This It?, and the overall sound creates much of the same result. It would be hard to differentiate both records if you just stumbled upon the band for the first time. On Room on Fire, standout tracks like Reptilia, Automatic Stop and Under Control prove the band is one of the most important groups out today. I am hooked, and this CD won't be leaving my stereo for a long, long time. If you loved their first record, don't hesitate to pick this one up ASAP. If you haven't heard Is This It?, then go buy both CDs and play them back to back. Rock is alive only because bands like The Strokes are making their brand of music."
5,"two steps forward, three steps back?","I liked Is This It more, it was a perfect album from start to finish. But I still give this one 5 stars because it's excellent and suffers only if you compare it to the first one and expect that same perfect retro nostalgia for a hybrid band that never quite existed. Songs like Automatic Stop could be from the first album. Room On Fire is faster than Is This It, the tracks are shorter, and with the new elements they add to the mix it's more eclectic, the effect being busier, like you're channel surfing.The End Has No End won me over, that irresistible chorus of ""oh no"", pure pop perfection. And this album works very well on infinite repeat, 33 minutes in all. I think it's the speed that makes the album a success, it's like zooming by the countryside in a fast car, each time you pass through there's stuff to take in as you go."
2,A huge dissapointment,"Not a single song on the album distingiushed itself from any other and not a single song warrants listening to again. The entire album runs just over 30 minutes, but it plays like one continuous, mediocre song. ""This Is It"" was a fine album and a great departure from the monotony of popular radio, but this new CD shows nothing us nothing new and certainly nothing nearly as inspired."
3,Nada de novo,"Acabei de ouvir o novo álbum de Strokes.Fiquei a pensar a razo porque os rapazes se deram ao trabalho de penasar em novo nome para o álbum. Parece-me que o nome mais apropriado seria Is This It - Parte II.Parece-me que os rapazes cairam no dilema do 2 álbum. As novas canes no tm nada de novo nem em termos melódicos nem em termos de mensagem.Algumas canes so ligeiramente mais rápidas que no álbum de estreia e os rapazes tentam em alguns solos (curtos) mostrar que já sabem tocar mais um pouquinho.Das canes do álbum destaco Under Control, com potencial para ser mais um single de sucesso para os rapazes."
5,Another amazing album!,"The Strokes sound hasn't changed, and that's a good thing. With the release of their second album comes fast strumming guitars, the familiar infectious melodies and the sometimes-nonsense lyrics of Julian Casablancas. Their first ballad, ""Under Control"" brings a summery feel with major chords and simple lyrics, yet there is still the feel of The Strokes' meticulous beats that creates such a ""together"" sound. Their first single, ""12:51"" brings the familiar fast strumming chords of Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., with a new twist: 80's hand claps. On ""The End Has No End"" The Strokes reveal a metal sound in the start, which quickly turns into a mellow rock and once again the metal, accompanied by Fab's drum-box-like beats and Julian screaming into the mic. Overall The Strokes sophmore album is a perfect 10, and well worth the wait."
2,Don't listen to the boys cannibalize their first album,"The album isn't terrible, but it's not all that good either. It seems being The Strokes has proven to be a terrible burden for the boys who sound tired and bored on this album. They haven't developed as a band and a fan's fears have been realized. This album sounds like a collection of songs wisely omitted from 'Is This It?' Now cliched musings on how fast life is moving figure in successive tracks on the album so the boys aren't even bothering to mask the album's unoriginality. If you like that Strokes sound, check out The Buzzcocks. Far better to listen to The Strokes' inspiration than The Strokes without it."
2,Pull The Vocals Out of the Mix,"This is a new review of an old record. I like the songs, good hooks, catchy, etc. I just have trouble listening to it because they decided the singer's voice was so crappy that they buried it with distortion into the buzzy guitar mix. Personally, I don't think the guy's voice is so bad, so I don't get why the producers and mixing engineers ruined a good record. Too bad you can't buy the multitrack raw cuts and make your own mix. Yeah, I know some people claim that this is a Strokes sound thing, but in my opinion it is just crappy production."
5,A Great Companion Piece to Is This It?,"I think this album sounds mostly just like their 2001 debut epic Is This It with a few minor changes such as a taste for blues and reggae displayed on some songs but aside from this it its slice from the same pie. I would say the only things I really dont like about this album is the length, it clocks in at just above half an hour. And that ladies and gentlemen is wayyyyy too short even for a punk album. I believe there should be a disclaimer sticker that says ""if your looking for length dont expect much here"". But that being said you are looking for a good, short, fun cd to listen to than this is it indeed. This album is a lot better than the crap floating around out there these days such as the new Limp Bizkit album or those dumb ""punk"" bands like Good Charlotte or Simple Plan. If your looking for the retro sound of the Velvet Underground mixed with the Cars than this is a great album to purchase."
5,The Strokes are great,"Solid album. Great from start to finish, it's one of those albums u can listen from start to finish...clocks in at only 33 mins though, its worth ur money, go pick it up"
5,A great second album-definitely kick-ass....,"This is a great album, from start to finish. It's nothing like ""Is this it?"" which makes it even better. Its a totally different sound and a different mood as well. The only song on here that will satiate the radio listeners is no. 4 ""12:51"", but who the hell listens to the radio anymore with the crap thats being played on it today. Inconsequently, this is my least favorite song. To be brief-its an awesome album and I would recommend it to anyone who has an advanced musically inclined ear. It's a definite change from the ""great"" sounds of Seether, Default, Good Charlotte, etc."
4,"More of the Same, but is not a bad thing","This album can be summed up in the title I have given it. It has the exact same sound as the Strokes debut album, Is This It, but still amazes. The guitar work on Room On Fire, is much more sophisticated, as it is catchy. The clever little riffs included in each song are a delight to the ears. The Lyrics, are where Julian shows a true progression. My favorite is I can't win."
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"after the great debut IS THIS IT, the strokes create room on fire...i really like some songs like REPTILIA and THE END HAS NO END, but most of the songs i really don't care much..."
4,"Very good but, not like This Is It","On the first listen I was hesitant on whether I liked the album. However, a few more listens later, I love the whole album completely! I felt Room on Fire has a somewhat different sound from This is It, but I like it. I think This is It is better but Room on Fire is definitely worth the buy!"
3,Drums and vocals,"At first listen I couldn't even pay attention to see if the songs were any good. From what I understand this is the same producer that did their first record. But you'd never know it from the wierd sounds comin' outta this thing. The drums sound is very strange. When I first heard it I thought it was a picollo snare with even less low end. Or perhaps a drum machine. But when I listened again, I saw that it was possibly a failed attempt at recreating the STAX drum sound. But like many who try, they got it all wrong. And the vocals.... allthough the singing is perhaps more on key and together than on the first album, you can't hear them! The vocals are completely buried in the mix. Completely different than the up front crazy vocal sound of ""this is it"". With that said... some of the songs are starting to grow on me. And the strokes style is still there, if ya dig it. So I reckon you'd just need to judge for yourself."
1,Ugh,"I read lots of great reviews both for this album and its predecessor, Is This It, and I went out about bought Room on Fire on a whim. I listened to it all the way through once. I tried to listen to it again, but...couldn't. It was just so bad. The bass figures are the sort of simplistic crap you expect from a high school garage band, the guitar doesn't do anything interesting on all but maybe one or two songs, and the vocals are buried so deep in the mix that you can't even hear them (though after looking at the lyrics in the liner notes, I decided this wasn't necessarily a bad thing). The whole thing just seemed bland and uninspired. I really did want to like the album, honest. But bottom line, if these guys are supposed to be the ""saviors of rock and roll,"" I don't think I want to be redeemed."
3,Sorry about the confusion,"this is a good album. that is it, just good. 12fifty1 is a good song, so is reptilia. this is overrated."
1,Not nearly as good as anything they've done before,"Let me start by saying that Room of fire is a big disappointment to me. When I bought ""Is this it"", I was blown away within seconds by the low-fi still raw sound/noise of the opening track. When I gave this a try, I could not believe my ears. Why insist on the same technique? Why not take a step ahead and dare to push it to new limits? It seems like mister Casablanca and co. have been goofing around just looking forward to complete an album that is mediocre in comparison to their earlier work. Most of the songs sound like a pirate copy of some backstage rehearsal, and throughout the CD Julian does not seem very interested in opening his mouth to let a single clear word come out of it. I usually keep an open mind with new bands, especially when they are praised as the bearers of a new moment in music. But after listening to this bunch of incongruent noise I can only wonder, in a very Carrie Bradshaw way, Is this it?"
5,Room on Fire,The Strokes have made another incredible album. Julian Casablancas' vocals range from the almost lazy ones which lull you in to the grainy ones you can feel emanating from deep within. It's enough to give you chills sometimes.
2,Another Flopp,"From now on , I will listen to the song samples Amazon offers , because Room on Fire , as Fountains of Wayne Wellcome ... and Newsboys Thrive and ... ect... are uninspiring recordings of mediocre value . The money I spend thinking that Rolling Stone , etc... know what they are talking about is a shame , when I could B listening to more inspiring talent . Oh well , this should teach me a lesson ...."
1,Abuh?,"While the Strokes are called by ""musicians"" actual ""talent"", it would be helpful if they spoke coherent sentences, or had actual melody. I don't even have anything to say about it."
4,Almost Great,"This CD has great rhythm. It's one main flaw is that the lyrics are horrible. Though they may flow well and make a good tune, lyrics are what truely make the song.Best songs on the album: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10."
2,"It's not a terrible CD, it's just not very good.","Listen. The Strokes have talent. Some of the guitars here are great, if formulaic, and sweet. I've seen The Strokes live and both guitar dudes know what the hell they're doin'. Moving on, though, the bass player is incredibly inept, and Julian Casablancas is quick to get on nerves with that grating voice of his.I must say that ""Reptilia"" is one of the best rock songs I've heard in a long, long, LONG time. It gave my rating the extra star to make it two (**). That's about all this album has going for it, however, and that should be frowned upon. Listen, ""Reptilia"" was recently released as a CD single. Buy that instead, and save a few bucks.The Strokes are NOT the saviors of rock 'n roll. Some of you have mentioned The White Stripes. They aren't saviors either, but I'll tell you one thing, they're better than The Strokes.But hey, ""Reptilia"" 's good."
3,I'm not into 'em that much anymore...,You know this album really hasn't changed my mind about them. But I'll keep this short. 12:51 is an infectiously evil song. Just an amazing song. Rest of this album. Nothing to write home about. Kinda like this review.
4,The Strokes are the coolest,"The Strokes are the coolest band in the world. With their whole greasy-haired-cool-named-i-don't-give-a-f*** look and attitude, they just ooze with true coolness. They are the wet dream of any college radio station, with their fun rocking sound, and great riffs. I look forward to more from this band in the future."
3,Typical indie rock,"i think ""more of the same"" basically describes this album. There are no surprises. All of the songs sound similar and i have to keep checking the track number to make sure which song it is. There is very little unaccompanied music, most of the time there is singing except the few bars at the beginning or at the endof the song. But it is still pleasant to listen to it sometimes, if you want to listen to some up-beat indie rock. But there is little individual style in it."
3,IS THIS IT PART 2????,"You ever anxiously await the release of a new record, only to pick it up and be mildly dissapointed? Well this is how I felt after picking this one up. The record is not a bad one, it just sounds like Is This It part 2. I know this could be a good thing considering how good that album was, but I would love if they changed a little, or came up with an original album, independant from the first. Take a cue from artists like Bowie and Madonna, who virtually reinvent themselves with each new c.d., keeping them fresh and interesting.Pick it up if you don't own the first, it's pretty good, otherwise grab their first, stick it in your player and blast the volume till your landlord throws you out!!!!!"
2,Why did I buy this?,"I TRIED to like this band, really. The rock critics kept telling me how great they were, so I bought the first album and found it pleasant enough, but spent little time in my CD player. Then the follow-up and more hysterical orgasmic moans from the music press, so I caved in and discovered... ROOM ON FIRE. Yawn. Another reviewer mentioned the vocal distortion device, which left me wondering, ""can this guy really sing?"" The band sounds mechanical and devoid of passion. The best word I can use is ""underwhelming""... not really bad, just competent. Do not buy this album... if you want to steal or burn a copy, it might function okay as background music, but don't believe the hype. This band will not be remembered in ten years, except as a footnote."
4,Bad Ass Rock,"I like this album. When I first heard ""Is This It"" I instantly took to it. Their follow up is almost as good. I guess the first impression of a band will always be one of the best but over all this new one is worth while and exciting. Sure they've been over exposed but it's easy to tell that they've remained focused. I look forward to their next one."
4,more love than hate...,"although The Strokes may sound like The Cars, Interpol, Spoon, The White Stripes, etc. the strokes are about rhythms and repeating melodies and lyrics that soothe you into oblivion and although you may get a high from listening to Jack White sing about voodoo magic the strokes give serious pleasure. the one stupid song that they tried to make sound like a typical rock song in the beginning of ""the end has no end"" turned me off but i was instatnly turned on by the sheer fact that one of the names of their songs is ""meet me in the bathroom"". but its not about their song names. you listen to the strokes for the way that they perfected what arty bands like spoon introduced. you listen to them for the way they make you bob your head and how they don't jarr you awake at 5:00 in the morning when the alarm goes off. like Metallica does."
3,"it took me a LONG, LONG, i mean, LONG TIME","to get into the strokes. i mean, almost 2 years. but after hearing 'reptilia' and 'the end has no end' i finally decided, 'erhm. ok, well, they're pretty good.'now don't take the 3 stars heavily, 3 stars is pretty decent. it's good, worth the buy and to listen too. 4 would be great, 5 is amazing, and 3 is good. and like in another reviewer's recent review, that's just what it is, just... good.i never thought i'd finally admit that i do think the strokes are pretty good.people will still click ""no"" on the ""was this review helpful to you?"" button because they still don't brush their hair, and they still dress like they're making a fashion statement.hipsters don't like me."
5,A converted cynic...,"I will admit, I am one of those who hated The Strokes, despite really giving them a chance. After hearing ""Someday"" on the radio...I had to give in. Prior to hearing this single, I went to see Weezer, where The Strokes were scheduled to open. At the time, I was stoked that they canceled so I didn't have to sit through them. Now...I am very bitter with myself and the circumstances.With that said...I enjoyed the first album. I was excited for Room On Fire to be released. The moment I popped into my car stereo, I fell in love. ""Under Control"" was such a pleasant suprise. I love Julian's crooning. Every other song is fun and upbeat.To me, this is essential pop rock. I'm not an 80's New York post-punk fan by any means, so the comparisons mean nothing to me. I am a huge Head Automatica fan, though. If you are also a fan of Head Automatica (and not soley a fan of Daryl Palumbo), do yourself a favor and buy this album."
1,Terrible album,the strokes have failed miserably -- this sounds identical to the first -- a waste of money -- just put on their first record.
1,Next!!!,"Awful! Julian Casablacas had the nerve to put the bad mouth on Jet and their music, you'd be better tending to your own house fella!! Sold it back as used to record shop bought from!!!"
1,Style over Substance,"The strokes have ripped out the skeleton of bands like television and the velvet underground and given it a cute little bow tie and are now selling it back to a new generation. The music on Room on Fire is delivered in the laziest and most apathetic fashion possible because thats what's perceived as ""kewl"" these days. The lo fi production is truly an ingenius gimmick because they're not only saving money in the studio but also marketing it as trendy and fashionable. This music may be more tolerable than britney but it's still the same in principle."
3,"Stroke me, stroke me","Maybe they can become the next Beatles. Not bloody likely. The Beatles were innovators, while The Strokes are still coming off as imitators (albeit excellent ones). Their latest breaks no new ground. It actually sounds like a near twin to the first lp.Compare their second effort to bands like Pavement or REM,(both critics faves)second lp's and The Strokes aren't even in the same ballpark. Apeing the Velvets and Television is a nice gimmick, but two lp's is enough. Enjoyable, but throughly disposable. Buy it, but don't worship these prep-school poseurs."
2,"Seriously folks, not a good album","I bought this the day it came out thinking with all the praise and hype, it would be worth it. Well...it's NOT. I have their first album, and I really like it, so this was extremely disappointing. Luckly, I also purchased REM ""In Time"" that day, and found out what great music really is."
1,Nsync for people too insecure to admit theyre teenyboppers,"The Strokes are like Limp Bizkit, in that people dont see that theyre just a boy band until a couple years after their time. Dont worry, soon enough theyll be the next Vanilla Ice's of our world.This is nsync for people too insecure with themselves to admit they're teenybopping superficial nobodies. These are the same people who call their strokes cd ""the new record"", expressing a nostalgia for vinyl, a media they never experienced. Find other ways to feel grown up, ok lil jonny?Move over Limp Bizkit, kids like the Strokes now."
1,Save your money!,"If you desire just plain noise - this is the album for you.Didn't see anything noteworthy in it - only when it concluded, the silence was wonderful."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"Clearly these were tracks left off their 1st release. No energy, no imagination, no creativity, no life, no soul.Britney Spears(ugh)makes more of an effort than these guys!"
3,errr...nah,"""is This It"" was fresh revival of rock n roll in a period where music was becoming lame. This album is boring and very ordinary. Perhaps the strokes managed to kick off some steam so that other bands like the Hives, the White stripes, Franz Ferdinand and the like could follow in this direction but in the end I think that all that will be left of the Strokes in 5 to 10 years time will be one small date in the music history."
4,close,"Nice album. Worth the cheese spent. I wont say tracks 9-11 are bad, but i will say they arent my type of songs. Those 3 tracks are more throwback rock."
4,"Not as good as ""Is This It"" but still a very good sophmore effort","""Is This It"" was a pretty hard album to beat, and I think they realized that. ""Room On Fire"" is similar, but not in a way where you think ""hey this is just 'Is This It' but with more songs"". Like the first album, ""Room On Fire"" contains no filler and is pretty much just as enjoyable (it's very much a foot-tapper). Like ""Is This It"", ""Room On Fire"" also has a bunch of hit-worthy songs that help make it appealing to the masses (""Reptilia"" for example). Every song is laced with a very catchy beat or guitar hook and they mostly contain interesting lyrics, although Julian still sounds kind of emotionless most of the time. Nevertheless, if you like rock or are a fan of The Strokes you'll most likely enjoy this album. Recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"
4,Pretty Good,"Room on Fire is pretty much a mixed bag. Its true that the strokes seem to only have one style of song, but on Room on Fire they try out some different rhythms and guitar textures. There are several exceptional tracks and cool guitar riffs flow throughout. Although I personally expected a bit more, I think this album fares better than most nowadays, thus the 4 star rating. Over all this is a solid (and a bit repetitive) effort."
4,the strokes are alive,"this album lives up to the hype. I think it really is great. The perfect follow up to the perfect band...THATS RIGHT. ""You Talk Way Too Much"" and ""The End Has No End"" make this album worth getting. It has been dismissed as a ""carbon copy"" of Is This It but that is a weak argument. This album is darker, few songs have the same unreserved singalong feeling as ""Last Nite"" and ""Someday"". ""Reptilia"" and ""12:51"" are both hits without choruses, but somehow you dont notice. The guitar playing is great as can be expected from Valensi and Hammond Jr. This album is worth your time. The only reason I give it four stars is because there is no element of surprise with this album, whereas with Is This It I am still amazed with it. This album delivers in all the right places (catchy riffs, great vocals, an air of cool) and you would be foolish to not at least listen to it."
3,Solid,"Not Evolutionary, not revolutionary, but good. A vast improvement over their first album, ""Room on Fire"" is an offbeat collection of slacker tunes that can satisfy any listerner of music, even if you didn't like ""Is This It"", you should still give this a try."
2,sophmore slump,I feel this was a very poor follow up to ''is this it''. and it should have been titled ''is that it''.
2,Nothing new here.,I bought their first release and loved it and was really looking forward to this release. This is really a repeat of the first cd and there is no reason to go and buy this. You now have to question their talent here and their ability to improve as musicians.At 33 minutes forget it!
4,Not bad,"But not great. I loved Is This It and was expecting Room On Fire to disappoint me. I can say that it did not. I can say that. I can only support what other people have said, because I feel pretty much the same way: It's way too short, it takes several listens to enjoy it, blah blah blah. Should you buy it yes? Is it better than their debut? Not a chance."
4,The Strokes Are A good band,"If you ask me, this record is very similiar to the substanceknown to human beings as mustard.....you take it in, its reallynice and then it gets really warm and hot and you spit it out....thats it. You cant take the sheer intensity of this record in one go...you have to put some away for later....its excellent.There are good songs on it like Between Love & Hate and The Way It Is. If you dig this, you'll probably dig bands like Television,Bob Dylan and Booker T & The MG's too. Enjoy my friends, because its not gonna be around forever."
5,"The ""pissed off critic"" is two years behind","Critic, this is their second album. And if you really were a critic you would see the value in being original and not just putting out a critic friendly ""pop"" album. Get a clue. . . Instead they actually try some different effects on this album, and make it sound great."
1,"I'm considering setting my room on fire ...,","... but I'll start with this CD.Damn, the year went very well, I bought some great music. Then I made the mistake of buying this utter piece of hyped sh... Thankfully, it's only 33 minutes long. I've played the album twice and will never ever do so again, promise. Don't tell me anyone that it would grow on me - I'd rather have some exotic fungus grow on me.The songs (for lack of a better word) all sound the same, there's a lot of tuneless riffing, always the same rhythms, and the ""singer"" sounds like he was stuffed into an oil drum and recorded with a mike that's ""kaputt"". These guys have as much musical talent as my pet guppy. It's incredible what kind of rubbish gets hyped these days, and there's always idiots (like myself) who fall for it. Another lesson learnt."
2,Another boring Lyrical album,Of course the guy still talks like an anorexic (...) you can verily understand at least he is accompanied by good backgroundmusic this guy however has a very crappy voice.Not my styleLyrics 3/10 Production 8/10 Music 9/10 Style 4/10 Voice 0/10Overall 24/50 wich is 48% a halfed (...) album try harder 2.5 star
2,"Hey Ho, Let's Stop!","""Is This It?"" is a great album, but that's no reason to release an (attempted) carbon copy of it as a follow up. That's what businessmen do, not artists. Actually, I guess the Ramones did it, too, but they were so brilliant that no one cared. The Strokes don't have that luxury...."
1,Stroke the Banana instead,"I'm a 18 year old music fan who bought the Strokes Room on Fire. [...].This music is so, so hip, but so boring. There is no redeeming value here, nothing below the surface. Its all smoke and mirrors as my grandpa says. [...].I am actually enjoying my dads latest CD purchase MUCH more. [...]"
2,fairly Average,the Strokes are a Decent Band but upon hearing this Album there isn't much difference with there first Album.I don't get all the Buzz about them.I've seen other Bands such as them from the past with less Hype or attention.I have yet to hear a Knock Out Song from either of there Albums.
2,OVERRATED GROUP!,"Influential, groundbreaking!???? Give me a break! This sounds exactly like bands from the 70s. There's nothing new here, just like their first album. Almost every song sounds the same and the singer's voice is almost the same monotone sound throughout, hiding behind a voice effect. One of few ""rock"" records that put me to sleep, it's only 30 minutes long yet it feels twice that much. I don't understand the critical praise showered on this group at all. I'll stick with Interpol anyday. At least each one of their songs sound different!"
4,A Step Up...,"No Contest, 'Room on Fire' is the stronger of the two Strokes records. This was, without a doubt, one of the best rock records of '03."
5,Excellent,"Simply perfection. In a world where the charts and radio waves are cluttered with mindless preassembled auditioned bands playing music written by everybody except themselves, this is a welcome break. One of the better cds out there. It is mainly an extention of the cd ""Is this it"", which is by no means a bad thing."
2,I'm so cool I forgot to wash my hair!!!,"I'm sooo glad somebody finally commented on that stupid vocal affect these guys use. What the heck is with that?Anyways,I'm just a bored rich kid that wants to be a rock star, can I come play with you guys? We don't have to get real jobs cause our trust fund will pay for everything. We can buy quality equipment without a thought, pay for a studio and not have to worry about time. Record contract? No problem! PR and Marketing? Don't worry about it! Enough air play? Payola doesn't affect rich people! Golly gee gosh fellas, we've got it made.Daddy's taking care of everything."
1,overrated,"I'm probably the only person that will speak my mind truthfully on this band. I'm sorry but they are the most overrated band of the last couple years. It just doesn't make sense why they are as popular as they are, and as for this latest album, IT'S BORING, and sounds exactly the same as their last. The singers vocals are mixed so low and have a filter effect, do to his lack of singing ability. I have also heard the strokes live, and it really doesn't make much difference. They are unimaginative, and are not doing anything break through. Their music style has already been done,so I wish media would stopmaking it seem like they are these KINGS OF ROCK??????(According to rolling stone) Also, shame on the record companies that concentrate their efforts on this mediocrity!"
3,"put that cross away, no messiahs here","These guys are not saviours. they aren't ""amazing!!!!""-no matter what the ridiculous ""return of rock"" propaganda of rolling stone and spin magazine tries to make you believe. they are definitely not the ""future"" of rock or revolutionary in any way. They're derivative and very regressive.But while the hype that surrounds this band is annoying and tired, I have to admit the band's music is pretty decent and i like ""is this it"" as well as this record. i think the first four songs are the best on the album. overall, it's just a decent rock record--nothing more. so everyone can stop creaming themselves over this band and listen to all the great bands out there who don't talked about nearly as much as the strokes or not at all.there's good stuff out there, you just have to look for it.here ends the rant."
5,I'm on fire.,Their refreshing lyrics and music are a breath of fresh air. Simple yet deep. Julian's voice is orgasmic and you can't help but to fall in love with the rest band. They pulled it off wonderfully.
4,Depends where you are from...,"This is a very New York record. You might have to live in New York to get the singing,the simple kind of loud guitars, and the drum beat. The band is clearly influenced by the New York club scene, and they sound much like earlier bands from CBGB's and other NY bands, like Television and the Ramones. Overall this is a solid album. Normally I restrict myself to classic rock, mainly the grateful dead and Led Zep, but since they are only so many dead concerts out there, and you can only listen to Led Zep so many times, I was looking for a new median of music. The strokes are good, and much better than the majority of bands comming out now. I only give it 4 because 5 is reserved for masterpieces. Overall it is a solid rock album, and hopefully they will only improve with their sound and creativity."
2,NOT the album of the year,"The Strokes decided that their fomular works so they copied it and took the safe way out, basically they did another ""Is This It"". This is what made my dislike the album from first listen. I believe that every artist who releases an album has to make progress whether it is more mature lyrics or going into another direction (eg: what radiohead did after ok computer). I couldn't help but be dissapointed by ""room On Fire""BUT no matter what people like me say, we all should know now that they can and are getting away with this album. They have garnered so much respect from the rock world and reviewers that in-return they could not bring themselves to bag and tag this album as a dissapointment. The Strokes have power. But i must say they let this album slip and got a way with it, but next time it won't be so easy...."
4,"It's like the 2003-version of ""Is This It"".","Very similar to Is This It (expected, since it is the same band and all), and so draws a lot of comparison between the two. Granted, the first album is a tad better (being the original sure helps, too), but this is by no means a bad album. A lot of the songs, namely Reptilia, The End Has No End and 12:51 (probably my favourite off the disc) are fantastic songs. Catchy guitar riffs, great singing by Julian, etc. If you're looking for a different Strokes (haha...not intended), pick up First Impressions of Earth--another fantastic album, that is ironically drawing much criticism for sounding different. It seems as if the boys of the Strokes can't win whether they imitate of stray from their original sound. Either way, it's evolution, and it sounds amazing (at least to me).FINALLY: This is a great CD for any rock fan, even those who have yet not jumped on to the Strokes-mania. Listen to it all at least once, then criticize."
5,Definately a winner.,"I was a little hesitant to give this album a chance because of the negative hype The Strokes were getting. But I am REALLY glad I did. This album is one of those albums in which every song is extremely catchy and well done. It's very rare that one can find an album, and listen to the entire thing without pressing the skip button at least once.It starts off with ""What ever happened?"" a rather mellow but extremely catchy tune with a signature sound The Strokes seemed to have mastered. It then goes into ""Reptilia"", probably the crown achievement of the album. The single from the album is really fun and almost grunge-esque in style, the whole album taking on this garage genre of music. It keeps going in which the music doesn't get tiring or boring, each song keeps the foot tapping.I would say, if you really aren't into a more mellow sound or grunge sound, this is not the album for you."
4,Yep,"Great album, the equal of their debut. Not much else to say really, if you liked Is This It, you'll like this. 'Under Control' is the best song they've written so far."
4,Is change really that good?,"The Strokes hit big with their follow up album to the heavily hyped first album ""This is It."" In a time where bands are constantly trying to reinvent themselves The Strokes do exactly the opposite. They realized that the sound that they had on their first cd was golden and that it did not need to be heavily altered in any way. There sophomore album ""Room on Fire"" has been criticized as being ""This is It Part II"", so to speak, but I question, is that all that bad? The solos and guitar work are much improved on this album as represented in songs such as ""Between Love and Hate"" and ""I Can't Win"", and with songs such as, ""The Way it is"" and the first single ""12:51"", The Strokes prove that they are hear to stay."
1,pass,"Jink jink ka-jink jink ka-jink.This is me expressing the rhythm of every single song on this album.oifdhaegfsadf;l,a\fasoijfsThat was me getting slightly angry at seeing the strokes on the late-night music video show once again.jfasdf\sdfjsdfchndsThat was me choking on my drink, laughing as I read an interview where they throw in some loose connection to the Velvet Underground, somehow giving them the 'underground cool'.That empty space was left there to represent the relevance of this band in 10 years time.G'night."
1,are you stoopid?,"ahh, i mean c'mon...there's alot of great music on this web site, but not here...this cd is like day old cold pizza..."
2,Yes good rock but blah boring.,"Does this kind of rock music get anybody excited? Or does it just make you feel cool because the Strokers are ""cool""? Of course the media loves this band, because the media is based in NY. Jack White alone can rock the holy hell out of these tards. There's nothing new in their sound, it's just different compared to what else is out there. Lame."
4,Great Outdoor speakers,Had Niles several years ago. Then went to Paradigm 470SM. Big mistake. NIles are the best outdoor speakers I have heard.
5,Great Book!,"i bought the book, and it is great if you already know the basics of fishing. Frank sargeant gives you the areas that hold fish by labeling snook, redfish, tarpon, etc by islands and shoals etc. It is a great book for that reason alone because you can go to those locations and fish the way you like to (artificials or live bait). I strongly recommend it!!! It is an old book, but it still had great advice and the places he tells u to fish are because they hold structure and/or typical living enviorments."
2,Book contains too old of info and not enough fishing science for this day in age,"I have read the book and I use to live down here many years ago. I am somewhat familiar with some of the fishing grounds. The fish spots data is too generic and could be more detailed. This book contains all general info. Even the illustrations of charts seem hard to read and decipher using my newest charts, trying to pin point the areas the writer has described. The book is not worth buying because the information shared is not worth it either.I would have loved to have seen why and how these type of fish come into this area and what things do you look for in the contour and bottom terrain including tides, moon, water temp., current, salinity, time of year, spawning, specific bait types ie lures color sound rattles size etc .. I believe fishing is a science matched with understanding of the environment and what you are going after. Again I must say this fishing book was too generic and not more intellectualized."
4,for any jazz lover,"If you love jazz and love sidney bechet, you'll love this memoir. So detailed yet heartfelt, very good buy!! Must in any jazz-lover's book collection."
2,cheap,"I ordered two boxes of these Sparco hanging files and they both arrived damaged. One file was cracked but functional. The real problem was that there was one file in each box that had the little plastic tab that connects them broken off. I've seen this issue in other reviews so I think it's pretty common. It's both a quality issue (tabs too flimsy) and a packaging issue (not protected during shipment). This basically means that you can't connect them to one another to be hung in a group. I wanted one long column of them, hung together down the wall. With the broken tabs, that's not possible - you have to hang them individually. I glued them together, but that is hard to do and get them to hang straight, plus now they look really ugly (glue shows through the clear plastic). When I bought these Sparco files I also bought a set by officemate. They were much better made and arrived undamaged. Lesson- Spend a couple of extra bucks and buy better quality."
3,Just what we needed,These were just what we need for our office area. Easy to mount on the wall. The depth accommodates about a two inch thick stack of folders.
5,A great guide for improving the quality of your church!,Stan Toler and Alan Nelson give wonderful and specific helps to turn any church into a 5-Star Quality Service Church. The evaluation questions at the end of each chapter are wonderful to help church leadership evaluate where they stand in serving God's people. Toler & Nelson offer important insights to FAQ's that will prove helpful to any church. An excellent resource to make every church excellent!
5,Great guidelines for the Christian Congregation.,"I haven't finished reading this book, yet. It was required reading for the officers of our church. This book has guidelines to teach the Christian Community how to better itself and how to build cohesiveness. I would recommend this to all churches and to many businesses who deal with people on a regular basis."
4,Minster Friends,I actually bought two copies for my pastor and another friend. I first read some of the book at my hair dresser and found it very informative and decided to order copies for my friends.
4,Great source...,"Great source from prominent scholars... Unfortunately, Turkic languages have been neglected for a long time for several reasons... The only thing missing in this nice reference book is a nice map. The map that was provided at the beginning is really bad."
3,Too Technical for my brain,"Ancient archaeology is an interesting subject but Childress gets way too technical. He describes the evidence of ancient machinery on the planet and then goes on to describe what it was probably used for, how it was made and why it worked. The jist of these stories is interesting but he just goes on and on and it's rather hard to understand."
2,Needs a few improvements,"The topics are covered in a Ripley's Believe It Or Not Breathless Rush that leaves the reader wondering where it all will lead. Because there is no index, you will find it difficult to go back and find the inscrutible passages. Because there are virtually no margins (1/4 inch instead of a standard 1 inch) there is no place to write notes or even put stickums without affecting the text. The lines are closely leaded (too close together for comfortable reading) perhaps to save paper or cut costs, but regardless, a less-than-comfortable reading experience. Numerous anecdotes and examples are repeated, as if nobody bothered to edit the text, but rather just wrote it down from a transcribed tape or video. The lack of attention to these basics of book-reader's expectations makes you wonder about the validity of the contents. Good info, but bad format."
3,Are we only rediscoverers?,"Not entirely convincing, but it is provocative and it brings to light things we may not have considered about our anscestors."
2,A rehash,"Everything in this book has been written about already by authors like Erich von Daniken, Charles Berlitz, Alan Landsburg, Andrew Tomas, and countless others. And still nobody has come up with a satisfactory explanation in 30 years..."
4,Very interesting read,"Well written. There are a lot of questions raised here. Historical records are fraught with anomalies that we are slowly beginning to unearth. Even if the whole idea of alien intervention is rubbish, which is not the point here, there are still a lot of clues to the fact that mankind has made incredible technological leaps in the past and we are finding that mankind was much more advanced than we assumed."
3,Technology of the Gods,A great book if you don't know where to begin or are just curious. Presented like a Ripley's believe it or not of the ancient world. A handy reference to the many oddities of the unexplained.
3,Interesting topic,"I can't say much for the writing ... a lot of repetition, so-so grammar, so-so printing. It seems the author used more references to others' books than his own material. In many parts of the book, the author seemed to get hung up on the details, to the point of being too much ... makes it tiresome to read. Photos/drawings in the book are poor, low quality, amateurish.But the price was right and the topic, interesting."
4,Fascinating,This book is filled with incredible and plausible descriptions of technology that has been ignored or explained away by traditional science. A MUST read for anyone that believes there are many secrets hidden in the past.
3,Not for the rational,"It's mildly interesting, in a science-fiction sort of way. Just a rehashing of things you've read or heard (and doubted) before."
3,Open to new history,Book is very interesting but somethings are a bit of a reach. He rambles a lot but does make a point or two. Some of the drawings presented had no relationship with the subject. Some drawings seemed to be placed there to develope credibility.
4,A Compelling Narrative,"Huffman spins a compelling narrative about the West African country whose destiny, for better or for worse, has been intertwined with its ""stepchild-like"" relationship with the United States. The book is well written and a page turner. My only critique is that by focusing on one particular group of individuals, Huffman necessarily sacrifices the proverbial forest for a very impressive tree. This book would best be read by the non-specialist who has first taken a look through a good political history of Liberia like the ones written by Professors Sawyer (THE EMERGENCE OF AUTOCRACY IN LIBERIA, Institute for Contemporary Studies), Ellis (THE MASK OF ANARCHY, New York University Press), or Pham (LIBERIA: PORTRAIT OF A FAILED STATE, Reed Press)."
1,bad bad history,"This is a compelling story, but it's full of inference and excessively fluffy. From a historian's perspective Huffman does not have enough evidence to be legitimate. If you're looking for a real history of either Mississippi or West Africa (my two areas of expertise) look elsewhere."
4,Sony PSP Auto Station Black a good buy.,"Overall the product Sony PSP Auto Station Black is a good buy, though it does have some quirky design features. I purchased this product for my kids to watch their PSP movies in the back seat of the vehicle. This works great. However, this probably would not be the case if my vehicle only had one auxillary jack located in the front of the car. The cabling on the unit seems to be attached incorrectly. The cable leading from the stand to the aux plug is only 8"" inches approx., while the cable from the cup holder portion of the stand to the Game console holder is almost 3'feet long. This would function better in the reverse.Other than that, this product rocks. My kids love it!"
1,BAD BAD,"You think it looks nice, and it's cheap, but thats not true. Sure it's cheap, but it looks nothing like the picture. Its a badly manufactured, MADE IN CHINA, baton. Hopefully you don't make the mistake that I did."
3,Adequate,"This product was easy to apply and remove,with a power buffer,but didn't really give me the same results that I got from Mother's Paste Wax. It put a good shine on my boat but didn't remove as many fine scratches as I hoped."
5,MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Some of the gore effects ain't as good as deadly alliance.(LIKE Baraka's fatality where he kuts off all of your body barts and blood bubbles and dissapears after hitting the ground)But who kares at least there is new features like a demo of Area 51,an all new konquest mode(YA GET TO WALK AROUND),ASIDE THE GORE THE MOST INTENSE!,and kool puzzle and chess kombat.My favorites are Baraka,Scorpion,and Sub-Zero.Kome over to your local game place and buy Deception!"
5,Wonderful holiday stories!,I ordered just because the cover was so beautiful and put me in the holiday mood--but both stories inside were great reads! I'll read this author again!!
3,Good for listening to on road trip,We bought this to listen to on a road trip. As Sci-Fi enthusiasts we wanted some audio books to listen to on the road. I didn't enjoy this tape as much as some of the others we had. The quality is poor didn't really grab me.
3,Channelllock quality,"I purchased the Channellock 415 smooth jaw T&G; Plier. I have notice that their quality is less than it has been in the past. The plier is coated with a type of laquer film and that makes a smooth action problematic. Also, there is a burr on the smooth jaws that I will have to remove with a file, so it will not scratch the plumbing fixtures.The product is usable, but quality control needs to be increased."
5,ALL CHANNELLOCK PRODUCTS ARE GREAT,"I HAVE WORKED AT PLUMBING AND PIPEFITTING FOR OVER 30 YEARS. I HAVE TRIED MOST ANY SORT OF WRENCH OR PLIER THAT WOULD HELP ME WORK FASTER. CHANNELLOCK PRODUCTS ARE WITHOUT COMPARISON THE BEST ON THE MARKET. IF YOU HAVE A CHANNELLOCK, YOU HAVE THE BEST. DON'T BOTHER BUYING ANYTHING ELSE. AND SHOULD THEY FAIL IN ANY WAY, THE STORE THAT CARRIES CHANNELLOCK WILL HAND YOU A NEW ONE. BUT THEY SELDOM FAIL. I'VE HAD ONE PAIR OF PLIERS BREAK IN ALL THOSE YEARS. THANKS FOR A GOOD AMERICAN MADE PRODUCT."
4,Innocent Knowledge,"Move over Dan Brown! Maggie Owens has got to be the latest of the ""I can't put this book down til it's finished!"" authors to splash on the scene of cliffhangers! Innocent Knowledge explodes with suspense, drama, and danger, holding the reader in its grasp and clutching his attention with terror seeping down his spine until the final ""Whew!"" releases his tension on the last page! It is truly a ""ten-finger nail-biter""!If this is the first book for Miss Owens, I can hardly wait to see the next, and the next, and the next! That is, if my heart can take it!"
5,My son loved it!,My son just read this book (he is 9). He absolutely loved it! It dealt with some real life issues by way of a 12 year old's language. I wish she had more book published. I went on here hoping to find some.
5,Best in Bibles,"If you can only afford one bible the Hertel bible should be it. The Hertel bible is the most complete reference bible that I have ever owned. If you can't find it in the Hertel reference sections, you would need a professional library. The Hertel also list odd and interesting facts, doctrinal and practical information, practical instruction for personal workers and much more. It is a great bible for the new christian or anyone interested in bible study. I have owned one since I first became a christian 30 years ago, I have tried many bibles and liked many of them but I have never found any bible to compare with the Hertel for practical use and long term study."
2,bully as 200 aluminum step side,"Product was brand new but did not match the photo it was totally diffrent from the others on the truck not very happy. shipping was fast, and the buying experience was good but you need to inform the buyer if the picture does not match the product"
3,Side Step,Product is excellent.The issue was in the product description- unclear as to what make and models it will work for.
4,will this fit my 89 chevy Z71,will this fit my 89 chevy Z71 that has a 6 inch body lift??????????? can anyone give me some info?????????
4,a young Brent Spiner...,"this is a good movie, well directed and played.the most important thing for me was to see a young Brent Spiner who has a little role, but however he is the friend of the protagonist and he helps him to fly..."
4,Chilling!,"In my opinion the ""Devil's Orchestra"" is da bomb, plainly speaking. I think it's Christian fiction with an edge. In the beginning I wondered where these scenarios were going and how she was going to connect three whining characters. The bomb fell in a much later chapter with the appearance of Devil Luke who has come to retrieve his orchestra of bad actors. It gets rough and real from here on out. Luke makes each one live through horrors in nightmare-settings he, the Devil, is going to heap upon them if they don't proclaim to heaven that he is the Master of their souls. Chilling descriptions!Bottom line it's cleverly handled and well written. Congratulations, Sydney Molare. I'm waiting for your next one. I'd give ""Devil's Orchestra"" 4 stars.Minnie E Miller, author/publisher."
5,FABOULOUS READ!!!,This was an excellent novel!! I won't reveal the plot; I will only say that this is a MUST read for all!!!Ms. Molare and outdone herself!!
5,The best portrait lens I've used,"This is a specialized lens, but one I absolutely would not be without. I use the 16-35mm and 24-70mm zooms for general shooting, but the 85 1.2 is what's on the camera most of the time. I moved to Canon for digital photography after years as a Leica shooter with the 50mm F1.0 and the 75mm f1.4 as my favorite lenses. This lens is in a league with those amazing lenses. It's very very sharp, but at f1.2 has maybe a quarter of an inch depth of field with a beautiful bokeh in the out of focus areas.For those that complain about the shallow depth of field. THAT'S THE POINT. That's why you buy this lens. Yes you can use it stopped down and it's a very nice 85mm at f2 and above, but in a modestly lit room with a 5D MkII I've taken some of the best portraits I've done in 40 years at f1.2 or f1.4. I love this lens and wouldn't be without it in my kit."
4,Superb bokeh but lacking in autofocus speed.,"I will spare you all the detail of prior reviews as I believe they have probably all rehashed the superb qualities of this lens. It excels at portraiture and superb smooth bokeh that makes your jaw drop. Even your out of focus shots hold a mystique from that dreamy bokeh that makes you go back and look at them over and over again.Where this lens is lacking is in its autofocus speed. Moving all of that glass is not fast and this is certainly no autofocus sports lens. This is where I knock 1 star off. If Canon can improve the autofocus speed on this lens then it is without a doubt deserving a 5 star rating. Even without it however, when applied to the proper subject matter this is a superb lens.BTW: I have given this lens the nickname of Glass Sphere. When you pick it up for the first time the heft you feel makes it feel light you're holding a solid sphere of expensive glass..."
5,A journey into the masterful,"I've only been using it for a short while and I can already say that this lens is going to take me a bit to master. Still, it's very forgiving when not wide open and I'm really liking the results so far! Unbelievably sharp, excellent bokeh, good feel. Heavy, but balanced (on a 40D). Manually focusing is a bit clumsy, but with a chunk of glass this large, I can see why the internals are so ""precise and micro"" for the focus.Like others have said... at wide open (f/1.2) and even at ISO 100, it's easy to blow out your shots. At night, this lens belongs at 1.2, but by day, it's best when stopped down a bit. This lens will make you learn to be comfortable in manual mode.Regrets? NONE!"
5,Very Good,"Remarkable!So far I have shot at nothing but 1.2 on this lens and love the look. A softness I can't get with any other lens. Manual focus is a little strange with the focus ring. Feels loose (I read this is normal), but is accurate.I am not a professional photographer and did not need this lens, however I wanted it so bad! Reading all the reviews, looking at sample images...I had to have it! Shooting with this lens is a challenge but a fun one at that. Since I purchased the 1.2 I have not taken it off my 5D Mark II. It's my new favorite lens."
4,"Awesome images, slow to focus","Was surprised at how slowly this lens focuses. It really takes a while if the object is completely out of focus initially.Otherwise, this lens is a killer. I am extremely happy with the quality of the pictures I get from this.It is built amazingly well. When you take it into your hands, you know you've got something of extremely high quality."
2,Not much better than my 85mm 1.8,"This lens has some focusing problems. I used it on my 5D Mark II and couldn't get a single focused pictures. I was able to improve the sharpness using microfocus adjustments on my camera. But at the end, my 85mm 1.8 works just as well and is much lighter and easier to handle (not to mention the $1500 difference in price tag). I had high hopes for this L lens, but I'm really disappointed."
2,Save your money,"I dont see what all the raving is about, this lens is not so hot. Bad chromatic aberration, its slow to focus, and it is tough to calibrate. Add to that it also does not allow tight portraits because of the poor minimum focal distance. Get the 135mm f/2, you can stand closer and you are already optically closer so you can get a much tighter portrait, and the IQ is top notch. This lens is not worth $1800. It pales in comparison to the Nikon 85mm 1.4. If you must have 85 for portraits buy the Nikon adapter and use the 85mm 1.4 from nikon, it is half the price so you still get off cheaper and the optical quality is top notch, one of Nikon's sharpest lenses and let's face it. Nikon is a better lens company than Canon."
3,cuter to look than to cuddle...,"I bought this toy at first for a friend who is in love with sharks (yes we re adults). Then once it came, I wasn't so attatched to it. The picture makes it look adorable, squeezable, and soft. The truth is it's hard, made with basic stuffed animal fur (the cheap feeling kind), and parts of him (tail, fin) we re sewn crooked.This would be more of a toy to play with, or use as a bed pillow to look at, rather than to cuddle and hug."
4,Cuba Cocina! The Tantalizing World of Cuban Cooking-Yesterda,"The book is very true to the Cuban style of cooking. It has many recipes that my family forgot how to make since leaving Cuba. It has many old recipes with new twists to them, to make them a little different. This book has almost every recipe that you could imagine and would find in any Cuban restaurant all in the comfort of your own home. This is a wonderful book and very easy to use and understand."
2,"Ok, but not Cuban!","I bought this cookbook thinking I was going to have a whole slew of receipes that I hadn't seen before. True. But the taste is not Cuban. It is a hodgepodge of Latin flavors influenced by Mexico and Puerto Rico. They taste well, but it is not Cuban. So, I believe if you are going to put Cuban on the title, the food has to be Cuban. That said, I've done several receipes and they are easy to follow and tasty. If you want a Hispanic cookbook -- whatever that U.S. census ""race"" is -- then, this is it. The ingredients are easy to find. But again, not Cuban and that to a Cubanita Cook is a sin."
5,Money Well Invested,"On the positive side, it's solid, stable, effective, and addictive. The first few times I used it, progress was slow. But once I mastered the technique, it's difficult to not use it every day. Terrific product, just the right balance of cost and quality. Only ""criticism"" is that the handles are a little high and long, but you can grip the handles lower and still gain the effect. I did a lot of research before settling on this product - I strongly ecommend this purchase. Assembly was a bit (predictably) tedious but could be logically followed as well as done alone. Delivery was also MUCH quicker than forecast too."
2,I've seen better,"I bought this DVD after seeing a ten-minute segment from Michael Loftus on one of the Just For Laughs compilations from the Montreal Comedy Festival. It seems that most of the funniest bits were on the video I saw earlier. This video left me less than impressed - and I was looking forward to seeing it. Loftus seems to be pretty much a one-trick pony, with the vast majority of his material aimed at his wife. I found it more tedious than funny. I will be selling this DVD - if anyone will take it."
3,We laughed a couple times,I bought this after seeing a special the comic had on TV recently and only catching minutes of it. During that special I laughed enough to look this guy up and buy this DVD. It's good his stand up got better. I would loan this to friend but don't recommend to buy. I wouldn't watch it again. I will order the special that was on TV when available. It was really good.
1,Pay for 2035sjt and got 2035s,I ordered and paid for a titanium ceramic coated headers and got stainless steel...what happend here ?Got part 2035s instead of 2035sjt
2,Not what I expected.,The book seems too technical to be really useful. I was hoping to give it to my 20 year old granddaughter but she would find it boring and tedious although she is a smart avid reader.
3,HSP or Asperger's?,"The book is very helpful but I'm not sure how being a HSP this is different from Asperger's -- in particular Asperger's in women. It seems like two different names for the same condition. In any case, if you are female and suspect that you are a HSP you should probably take the Aspie test:[...][...]And/or read this great -- if long -- Aspergirls blog post about women and Asperger's syndrome:[...]Whatever name you give it, it's be a difficult road so best of luck to everyone!"
3,Didn't quite hit the mark,"I bought this book with the recommendation/ suggestion from a friend. Based on the info from Amazon, I thought it might be a helpful read. But after obtaining the book, I discovered it doesn't really describe me as much as we guessed. I'm taking that as good news (no sense taking on another label).The author does a really nice job of reassuring readers that being an HSP is ok. Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of and that success and happiness are still within reach. So a very nice, concrete, positive book. Lots of practical exercises and things to ponder, but if you aren't really a ""highly sensitive person"", it falls rather flat."
5,"Appropriately subtle, complex and extremely accurate.","This is the definitive guide for those of us too deep for typical ""self-help"" books. It paints an appropriately subtle, complex and extremely accurate portrait of those who are highly sensitive, as well as providing thoughtful and balanced guidance on how to thrive in a society that devalues our gifts. It addresses how we might do so responsibly, without using our sensitivity as a ""cop-out"" and how in so doing we may contribute to the betterment of both society and ourselves"
4,Words to Describe Me,"I did not know that my sensitivity was an asset, I was always told to ""Toughen UP"" by my family. The thick skin I have grown is a callous that I thought I needed. This workbook helped me celebrate myself in a way I haven't indulged since childhood . . ."
5,Buy this book!,"My life has changed since I read this book. Having been told for my entire life that I am ""too sensitive"" I was surprised and delighted to learn that being sensitive is a gift...YES, A GIFT!!! Our society has a negative connotation to shyness or introversion, which is how sensitivity is sometimes diagnosed. I wish my parents and teachers had read this book when I was growing up. My self-esteem has actually risen, thanks to this wonderful author. I teach young children, so sensitive children in my care will also benefit."
5,THANK YOU Dr. Aron !!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been spending my life LITERALLY MY WHOLE LIFE wondering why am i thinking and acting so differently from the rest of the world. My sensitivity is causing me a lot of stress to the extend of giving me fibromyalgia. I tried to adjust my mindset but I never felt that I fit into the majority of the population. I have tried very hard to find explanation for myself looking into areas like horoscope, birthday and even mental diseases like anxiety and depression but nothing seems to explain perfectly. I blamed myself for my sensitivity because no one really appreciates this side of me and I only seem to create troubles for others. Thank you Dr. Aron for spotting the HSPs and see the goods in us :) I feel TRULY relieved for the first time that all the clouds in my mind are cleared. Now I know that what I used to hate and dislike is actually one valuable trait of the rares :D I will learn to love it and make good use of it from now on !!!!"
5,Being sensitive is not a flaw!,"This book changed my life. I was always told that I was too sensitive, and that it was a flaw. I always thought I needed to ""get over it"" and embrace the world in the same way that non-sensitive people do. By reading this book, I came to the realization that there is nothing wrong with it, that I am just being myself, and I have nothing to be ashamed of. There's nothing wrong with preferring to read a book at home instead of going out partying at night. I highly recommend this book to anyone who considers himself/herself to be sensitive.There is a quiz at the beginning of the book to determine if you are sensitive or not. If nothing else, google it (you can find it online) and if you find out that you are sensitive, take a look at this book."
5,This book really helps,This book tells me that I am not alone and I am okay. It is written clearly with good suggestions.
5,Great resource!,This is a great resource written by someone who understands sensitivity. A group of us have read this book and while each of us feel we are at a different level of sensitivity we have all enjoyed it! Lots of information to digest.
4,HSP,Very new ideas to me. Loved the fact the writer is an HSP herself - certainly explains a lot to be sure. Worth buying
2,Consider conventional solutions first,"I was really into these theories for a while but now really believe some of these can be re-framed using physiological explanations. Consider High Sensation Seeking (HSS). Could this be explained by ADD or ADHD? Also consider Highly Sensitive Person. Could this be explained by an overactive limbic system ? I came up with these explanations after reading the following books:1. ""Healing ADD: The Breakthrough Program That Allows You to See and Heal the 6 Types of ADD""2. ""Healing Anxiety and Depression""by Daniel G. AmenConsider that the simplest explanation for something is usually the right one. In this case they would be imbalances in brain function. My respects to Dr. Elaine Aron and I read and bought all the books but addressing the unbalanced brain chemistry has helped the most. My thought are that the insight and knowledge she provides can be applied to the cognitive (mental) half of those treatments."
2,Incomplete,"I agree with others. This book is incomplete and flawed. Any book about being extremely sensitive that does not even mention ""borderline personality"" is inadequate.The book is boring, and please, the capitalization of Hightly Sensitive Person does not make the phrase any more important than the words themselves ;/ ."
3,Intriguing subject but not very useful,"When I read the first two chapters of this book, I felt that I was an HSP and this is the book right for me. However, when I read further, I was confused about the different methods that the author recommended, such as ""baby talk"" for adults, networking is not for HSP, etc. I don't think these ideas will give any positive impact on someone's life. But I do agree with the author that HSPs need sufficient rest, but so do non HSPs. At least, everybody needs to take good care of oneself. And be bold to pursue one's dream. Even if you are sensitive, it doesn't mean that someone will overprotect you."
1,Too Psychologically Deep,This book is very hard to understand. It seems as though one has to have a little bit of a background in psychology (or at least an understanding of it) to undertand the nomenclature of the book and to understand what is being comunicated. For the previously mentioned reasons I did not like the book. I expected it to be reader friendly and very practical(to suggest tips in one's life he/she could actually practice- put to use). It is not.
3,Highly Sensitive Persons,"The book seems to drag out and be boring, but there is some interesting information that I have never read elsewhere."
5,"Profound, Accurate, Essential Reading","Elaine Aron is one of the first psychologists to study the trait of high sensitivity, where others simply called it shyness, or viewed it as some kind of a disorder. This book clearly demonstrates the importance of this trait, how natural and vital it is to be explored and accepted.If you believe you may be highly sensitive, let this book guide you into an inner world you have always known existed for you, and let it show you how to bring this trait out into the world, where it belongs, strong and vibrant and beautiful in its many varied and individualized ways."
1,Confused and rather pointless,"I feel for the HSPs in the world. In many respects, I am one. However, this book had a pervasive pointlessness to it. Despite the promising title, the book offers little of substance. What's worse, it thoroughly confounds two separate traits: emotional sensitivity and sensitivity to one's environment. The two are vastly different and jamming them into one trait, ""sensitive,"" misses much ground for exploration. I was excited to start the book the first time I started it...and I never got very far. I started it again a year or so later wondering, ""why was it again that I never got very far in this book?"" I figured that out rather quickly. I doubt I'll pick up this book a third time."
3,First few chapters are great,"This book was really interesting for the first few chapters, but then I thought it became a little ridiculous. I have had problems with being highly sensitive all my life, but this account of how to cope with that goes a little overboard. It's still worth reading, you just may feel like skipping around a little."
5,Great Book!,"I've been one of those people who have been ""shy"" and crowd phobic; not only that, but I'm very emotional. This book explained me to myself and now I'm more understanding and accepting of who/what I am."
2,Same review as the workbook.,I didn't care for the ideas in this book. Very boring and silly. I couldn't read it beyond a few chapters.
2,The Highly Sensitive Person,"I was disappointed in the book. It didn't tell me much more than I already knew. I was hoping for some solid coping skills or other ways to survive in a noisey, smelly, rude world. I learned that I was probably born being highly sensitive. I knew I had this trait from an early age. So? What is the solution??? Ear plugs? Padded rooms? (yes, I padded my room). It is easy to write about the problem. How about a few suggestions to de-sensitize our nervous systems (medication apparently doesn't work well for me anyway), or something besides avoidance, which is pretty much impossible without moving to a deserted area. Not practical, even if it were available."
4,"A must read for HSP""s (highly sensitive people).","If you are highly sensitive and are wondering why you feel ""different"" sometimes this book will help validate you and celebrate HSP's."
1,Don't be fooled by the hype,"As someone actually diagnosed as highly sensitive and high-strung in general, this book came as a recommendation. If only this book was actually useful. I got pretty disgusted by the author's pop-psychology and pseudo-intellectual ramblings on how sensitivity is actually over-arousal from one's environment. The use of the word ""arousal"" for what could have been more neutrally termed ""awareness"" was a pretty big tip-off that this eminent psychologist and lecturer is pretty insensitive to those around her and that this book is meant to make waves and sell copies rather than actually help the people it is marketed towards. If you are indeed someone who falls into the category of highly sensitive, or easily overwhelmed, or hyper-aware to the point of withdrawal from society, get yourself some professional help and do not buy this book. Many psychology self-help books are utter piffle and this book does nothing to discourage that assertion."
3,did not find it so good,I got this book based on other's reviews that were generally good. This book describes HSPs and what could be expected with pep talks about how u shouldn't be worried that u are HSP. If u had thought about this issue (HSP issue) the book does not add any value but just tries to re-assure u that nothing is wrong with u. might be helpful for people that are really hurting but not for people who need more depth into this issue.
5,The Highly Sensitive Person,"An excellent guide for those of us who have been born ""highly sensitive."" Helps me to understand all those things in my childhood and earlier life that greatly distressed me and why. It's a great coping and understanding book. Highly recommended for ""HSP's"" and those who love them."
2,Not for the Emotionally Sensitive,"I was recommended this book, but was severely disappointed. Ms. Aron does not discuss emotional sensitivity at any length and consistently rambles on about over arousal. While I have learned to deal with lights and sounds that bother me, I have not learned to deal with emotional sensitivity and this book did not help. The first few chapters are all nearly identitical, and Ms. Aron gives specific studies of her peers to describe what happened during early childhood to shape sensitive people. I am not interested in what happened in early childhood, I am interested in now, and what to do to make my life a little less emotionally charged. I have to give this book 2 stars because it is so boring and irritating that it is difficult to finish."
1,May do more harm than good,"Okay, first the good: Yes, there are sensitive people in the world, and this book makes it okay to be one of them. Now, the bad: Sinking into your sensitivity is not always the best way to handle it. For more practical, less self-defeating hints, see Riso and Hudson's books on the Enneagram (Like me, you may be an Enneagram 4. You may also be an Enneagram 2, 5, or, possibly, 6. You may be a 1 who has gone in the direction of a 4). In any case, don't buy Peter D'Adamo's advice that blood type equals personality. Yes, his Live Right For Your Type is an excellent eating plan that leaves me feeling great. But this sensitive person is an ""aggressive"" Type O!"
3,To all you who claim high sensitivity,"Okay, I have only read part of the book. Yes, I think Americans place far too much emphasis on being outgoing and should take lessons from Oriental societies. But I just had to write this. I had found out not too long ago that a person's blood type is a likely indicator for their personality. Blood type O is known for being athletic, extroverted, and wanting to be the boss and type A are more noted for their sensitivity and being prone to anxiety. In the United States, over half are type O and about 35% are A types, whereas in Japan, over 40% are A type and only about 25% are type O. So I think that explains it partially. All you who have read the book and think it's you, you're probably A type, or in smaller numbers, type AB."
1,Bunkum,"Bunkum by a master grifter. Poorly written(not even entertaining as con artists can be:carnival sideshows!) and edited as well (twoof scores of insensitive errors: folk isplural, not folks; adage is an axiom, oldadage is wordy). Why with all the money Aronis making off her HSP industry, next we'lllearn that she has duped the most famouszoologists from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe toassert with her that HSPs evolved frompeaceful and loving (and hidden!) bonobos,orangutans, and gorillas and that the rest ofus did from out there, gang-warfaring chimps.I qualify nearly 100% as an HSP, and I wouldbuy that book and believe in it with all myheart and soul! And I'd spend the rest of mylife as a bonobo hoping to do whatthey--surely earth's only true saints--domost of their time. Facing prudish scorn,I would proclaim: I am an HSP; I am special;leave me alone, clods!"
5,This book is my autobiography,"This book has helped me understand myself and taught me how to live better, in harmony with myself rather than always trying to be what others think I should be. Anyone who thinks this book is less that excellent is NOT an HSP. In fact, I have yet to find a non-HSP who found anything positive to say about this book. I only know one other HSP personally, and both of us agree that this book is right-on and extremely helpful."
3,This is really a book about Asperger's Syndrome,"This is a wonderful book, but anyone who knows about Asperger's Syndrome sees that *every single characteristic* described in this book is typical of Asperger's. I guess the author either a) doesn't know about Asperger's Syndrome or b) is in denial that that is really her issue. That said, the descriptions are clear, the coping techniques are helpful, and her writing style is clear in describing the issues that can overwhelm a HSP/Aspie."
3,Pretty Much As Described,"Pretty much as described, but did have writing in it. The first test in the book was already completed, which was notdisclosed."
3,The workbook and relationship book from this author are a tad better!,"I'll write more about this book-I think but, It is very sad the author tells you everything but, the fact that your ADD/Aspergers/LD/ any combo of any of these. And I know most if not all the people with this wheather they know it, or want to admit it, are one of those things; if not a combo. And that's more important to know then you are a highly sensitive person which is just part of a side effect sorta often to any of those differences/disabilities. And the fact she doesn't know she has one of those things after her extensive research shows some of the limit she briefly mentioned she had about what she mentioned and told in her books."
4,"We're NOT all the same, and this book makes that okay!","This book relieved me. It relieved me because I realized that I've spent years trying to define success in terms that don't apply to me. After just a few chapters I was able to find the courage and the freedom to redefine who I am, what I want to accomplish in my life, and how I want to accomplish it. I guess I always knew that I was different from others - more affected by things that seemed banal to others, but saw it as a character flaw rather than just accepting it as me. The only slightly negative comment I'd have is that the writing style is somewhat dry. But this is more than made up for by the content. My blessings and thanks to Elaine Aron. I think I'm taking the first steps to changing my life so I can live it on MY terms, and not according to what I always thought I was supposed to be or do. Freedom. This book has given me freedom!"
3,Not exactly what I was expecting,I expected that this book would be more descriptive. It was very scientific and contained a lot of information that the average reader would find quite boring. I have not been able to finish the book.
1,"A ""feel good"" book","This book was a disaster. One of the few that I've ever given up on in disgust, about 2/3 of the way through. If it redeemed itself in the final third I'll never know.Save your money. Here's what it says, over and over and over again: ""Are you bothered by loud music, bright lights, crowds, other stuff like that? If so, then you're officially a 'highly sensitive person.' But that's OK. Indeed it's really great! Lots of people are highly sensitive people. Here are a few examples. It's OK! Feel good about it!""I had hoped to find some strategies to deal with a world where one just can't avoid loud music, bright lights, crowds, other stuff like that. There were none.Enjoy it. It's OK! Feel good about it! And save your money."
2,Book review,"I am about half way through this book and I have to say I am not thrilled with it. While there are some valuable insights listed throughout, it is not an engaging read, nor have I found a lot of scientific basis. Mostly, the author talks about her own highly sensitive nature and how she has tailored her life to fit in with ""normal"" (as she calls them) people. She also mentions her husband and his ""world famous"" studies a lot. There are ""exercises"" for you to do at the end of each chapter, but I haven't felt them to be of any significance. I'm actually tempted to not finish the book, but I will persevere in the hope that I will learn something from it. If I had it to do over again, I would find a different book on this subject."
1,Falls apart,"the worse quality, the glue falls off the ornament on the ribbon and can create a problem if your little pooch eats it,cant get them to stay together. will try gluing them into place myself but I recommend dont buy choose one without the problem unless you dont care what your poochy swallows"
5,Great intro to Guardian for non-rock listeners,"""Let the Whole World"" needs to be sung by every church in the world. It's an awesome melody with a powerful message, and it brings tears to my eyes whenever I hear it . Speaking of powerful, these guys just don't know when to stop. They minister at any volume. From ""The Way Home Back"" (a barrelhouse-blues number with all the slide trimmings) to ""Endless Summer"" (a #1 Christian Rock chart-topper) to ""Preacher and the Bear"" (a great New Orleans jazz treatment),I wouldn't be afraid to enter any cut on this CD into a ""smash-or-trash"" contest with any new rock song by any group."
5,"If I could put more stars, I would!","This CD lifts my spirits every time I listen to it - every time. ""See You in Heaven"" means the most to me because my father died February 22, 1997. Every time my family and I visit his grave, I play that song as we are leaving. My father heard that song before his death and loved it, so now I know he apprieciates it when I play it. I also enjoy the track ""Preacher and the Bear"" because I do this lil dance to it where I am sitting down and just swing my arms from side to side! I make my mom and brother laugh at that all the time!"
5,good seller,The CD is very new just as the description and the seller is very considerable when packed the CD and I received it only 5 days after the order was confirmed. I am very happy to get this high quality service and beautiful romantic songs with such unbelievable low price. Thank you.
1,Book was a waste of money,This book had sample letters for everything from a letter to a credit card company reguarding unannounced change in interest rate to a letter to a reaurant that served bad food. It would take an act of God to make any of the details of any of the letters work in most situations. The book was simple & nothing special....just things anyone could write explaining problems. Not what I was expecting and totally useless for me. Will donate book to thrift store.
5,The best act of the 21st Century!,"OK, it's a drum and a piano, but it's pure rock! If there's still any doubt left in your mind, just check their cover for Black Sabbath's ""War Pigs"". The energy, talent and passion this power duo puts into their songs compensates for any bass or guitar the most conservative rock fan would complain about. And their original work such as ""Coin-operated Boy"", ""Girl Anachronism"", ""Good Day"" and so many others shows exactly how inventive the sound of a band can get without sounding weird or boring, remaining faithful to rock, but with a new voudeville-like concept. It's really worth to check out the work of this two extremely talented musicians."
4,Awesome show!,"This movie is good for nay Dresden Dolls fan. Their performance was just impressive.The thing I liked even more than the performance itself, was the feature ""A day in the life of the Dresden Dolls""It follows them through an entire day, and it's definitly really cool to see."
2,I expected better,"After reading Groove, I understand why the author used a pseudonym. This book wasn't as good as her other books. It seemed too simple, whereas the writing in the others was very descriptive and imaginative. I wish I had borrowed it from the library rather than buying it and wasting my money."
3,Funny As Heck,"Chevy and Noah made this book, they were so funny! I found the book lighthearted, and funny. A little boring in spots, but not enough to make you set it aside."
3,I love Bernice L. McFadden but...,I'm not sure how much I like her as Geneva Holliday. This book was just okay. The characters were not well developed and what was the purpose of the book? Definitely not my favorite.
2,Boring!!,"In this book, it seemed like she wanted to add in so many climaxes that each person went through, she forgot to add in the friendhip and actual emotions they felt for one another. Then when you think all of their climaxes will come together and you could see how good of friends they are it just all comes together in like the last two pages. Its like she realized the book was getting too long and had to hurry up and end it and that scene seemed as good as any place to do it. I wish it would have seemed like she put more effort into this read."
2,"Competent at best, inaccurate at worse...","Whoever this Gary Gagliardi is, his mastery of the Chinese language leaves much to be desired; looking at his credentials, it sounds suspiciously as if he missed out mentioning one thing...hmmm, does he *know* Chinese? For one thing, translating the beautifully laconic ancient Chinese into brash staccato lines of poetry simply does not work; worse is his frequent mistranslations -- the character ""ye"" is often translated as ""also"", when it simply means ""period"" in an age where punctuation wasn't invented yet and ideogram characters are still used for sentence closure. Sun-Tzu here comes across as a livid boy scout master trying to rigorously hammer platitudes into our minds. There is this sneaking feeling that much of these ""translations"" are done using a computer software. Try Ames for a more accurate version. I'm very hard pushed to recommend this edition."
5,Beautiful Translation of a Great Book!,The only translation that you can proudly give as a gift. It is just beautiful! You can also use this version of The Art of War to see all the inaccuracies in other translations. It shows each character of the Chinese characters with their English meanings. It includes a glossary at the back that explains the Chinese ideograms in more detail.
3,Disappointing,"Though the first song is one of their best, I overall found this album disappointing. I'm not sure how to say it. Too ""American rock?"" I found King of Fools to be a bit more British sounding. Overall, not a bad disc, but the remake of Deeper has got to go. The original version is a classic, the new one is awful. Just my humble opinion though."
3,"Good, not great","This is an okay album. I was first drawn to Delirious because they were able to write and perform worship music that was ""cool"". I hope delirious doesn't end up turning into another typical Christian band. It'd be cool if they continue to pursue writing worship music that's on the edge."
4,How can a band continue to get better!,"This CD has a great new sound and I never seem to get tired of the song, ""Deeper."" This CD does go deeper with thoughts of focusing even more on the Lord (Beautiful Sun)and not forgetting who he is (Metamorphis). They rock with a purpose!"
4,Delerious? Eventually.,"Heard Delerious? play some of these new tracks live at Stoneleigh Bible week before I bought the album. The album certainly does not disappoint although the new sound of delerious? takes a little getting used to. It is more grunge orientated than King of fools but if you liked ''promise'' on King of fools you'll probably like this. The lyrics are a bit vague, it's not an obvious worship album but the more I listen to it the more I like it. Don't look for a King of fools clone and I think you'll like it too."
5,Only 5 stars?? This one deserves a 100!,This cd has it going on! I luv Delirious! I saw them in concert and they rocked! I love the sound of Martin Smiths (lead singer) voice! If you want a cd that moves your feet and your heart. This is one for you!!
3,Drifting from the Vision,"Delirious started as a worship band, and a great new and fresh one at that. Their songs captured the heart of the worshipper and let you own them and offer them up. I fear they are becoming too commercial with this release. The trend actually started on the previous album, King of Fools. The songs seem to be more focused on performance than the Cutting Edge material, even though the words are still good. Less here for a praise team to latch onto and play than in their earlier material. Too bad. Please don't sell out, guys!"
4,"Heard it, loved it, want it!!!","I saw these guys on PAX-TV the other night... I saw a couple of music videos from MEZZAMORPHIS, and instantly fell in love! I thought ""wow, this is just what us Christian teen punks need."" Alternative your thing, or simply soothing? They do it all!!!! Long haired guys are too Christians! I'm here to proove it!"
5,A great album from a way-cool band!,"This album seriously rocks! Although slightly different from their previous releases, Mezzamorphis is one of Delirious?'s gems. It includes the same Christ-oriented lyrics put to a strong blend of guitar, bass, and drums, for an incredible pop-rock sound!"
3,Cheap tire,"You get what you pay for... This tire didn't mount too smoothly, but finally did seem to be okay. I wouldn't trust it for a long ride, but it's fine for those who only ride a little."
4,Cheap but gets the job done,"These tires are very thin, and I doubt I'd try riding on them in the rain. However, for the somewhat obscure 26 X 1/38 size they're a bargain."
3,If you must have this size...,"Decent tire for cruisers or casual tour bikes. Not overly high quality, but then this size is rare. You can find better quality elsewhere in this size, but nowhere near this price. Not a bad idea to use a tire-liner with this brand. Bottom line: the best tire is the tire that lets you ride when you otherwise wouldn't. So this tire is decent."
5,The Soft Machine are Underground Gods,"This is one of my all time favorite albums, and you should make it one of yours as well. Mike Ratledges distorted Lowry Organ is a unique and amazing sound, along side Robert Wyatts insane, Jazzy Drums, and of course the flawless, incredible Bass playing of Hugh Hopper, and distinct style of Classical-Jazz horn playing by Elton Dean makes The Soft Machine absolutley incredible. ""Moon in June' is not to be missed. If you've never heard it, just by this cd, throw on some headphones and slip away. I'm 15 and one of my favorite things to do is to listen to"" Moon in June"" on headphones, so trust me you'll like it. Life isn't much without this album, so augment your life with a little madness and buy it."
4,Worth it for the one great track...,"Maybe it's just the personal thing of growing up doing my homework while John Peel played these tracks on Radio One...But I love ""Moon In June"". Robert Wyatt is a genius or at least part of the corporate genius of the creative 70's and this rambling brain dump of thoughts and music has it all,... humour, sex, jazz, pop, and of course psychodelic visions of the drugs I never took, but didn't need to when Third was on the shelves... Shame about the other tracks. Maybe I'll get in to them one day."
5,mindriot,"After injesting some potent smoke, I'd sit back with the headphones and zen out to this record.Towards the end there's a breakdown where they have some weird voices and odd keys making a whirling, almost satanic sound,giving me the ultimate trip. They remind me of that movie ""Fantastic Planet"", tripped-out 70's sci-fi space jams. Heavy!"
4,Near-masterwork,"Many progressive rock acts tried to materialize a similar sound, but precious few were able to pioneer it like this machine, and third will forever reiterate that; even when overreaching or seldom overbearing the intensely personal synergy always comes across."
1,this recording stinks (should be a 'zero' stars rating),"oh you've heard it all if you've read the reviews here - ""progressive rock"" ""jazzy"" ""obscure"" and even ""one of the best prog.rock albums"" - please - gimme a break - hey - i *love* yes & floyd & elp & the nice & ozric tentacles & the enid & a slew of other prog.rock bands - but this recording ""third"" by soft machine is something to avoid - it has no direction & meanders through some very odd sounds (king crimson made it work - these guys fall shy of the mark each time) and will bore the bejeepers out of you - save your money & buy a six-packi'm certain this review will peeve many a reader who ""just *love* this band"" - but if you're not familiar with them - thank your lucky stars & avoid this disc - it stinksspace puppy - out"
5,I love Julio Iglesias songs.,I grew up listening Julio Iglesias. His sons are very romantic. Me gusta mucho Julio Iglesias. Es uno de los mejores cantantes españoles. Este CD tiene muchas de mis canciones favoritas.
2,wouldn't recommend,"it is kind of cheesy, not really what i expected. not happy with it and will not continue to watch anymore episodes."
5,you buy this now,Love the showI mean it is one of the only good things to watch on the idiot boxit shipped quicklyI got it before the date was due
1,Too much of not enough,"Not a good choice. Lacks detailed ""how-to"", lacks explanations, Lots of ""stuff"" mentioned, but not much on what to do with it. Sorry I wasted the money."
2,if you are an absolute beginner,"This book turned me on to digital scrapbooking with its overview of what could be done. Most of space is projects--which I would never do, but suggested possibilities. The ""how to"" is mainly if you purchase scrapbooking software--which I also don't plan to do. So, if you know nothing, book is inspirational, although, being a hard cover, also expensive."
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"Luckily I didn't buy this book, because it did not provide any help to someone who already can use a computer. I was hoping for information on creating page layouts in photoshop or other editing software. Instead I got a lesson on scanning photos into the computer. Most of the projects in here involve editing the photo on the computer, then printing it out and making a regular scrapbook page. I wouldn't recommend it for people who want to do digital scrapbooking."
1,Not good for anyone except a complete novice,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is for people who know basically nothing about a computer. I didn't want a computer lesson, I wanted digital scrapbooking info. I didn't get any. I completely wasted my money on this book."
3,Covers too much to be useful,"I returned this book because it is more suited to someone who is completely new to using the computer for photos. Each chapter covers the basics of one tool for digital scrapbooking: such as scanning, printing, software, etc.I was hoping for more on ideas, layouts, journaling, etc. All covered in other scrapbooking books, but slanted towards digital scrapbooking.For someone who is completely new to using computer tools for working with photos, this is a simple overview."
3,wheres the pictures??????,I bought this book to read and look at with my [...] son who is in love with dragons and creatures one look at the cover and we were excited to get it here however one would think an ENCYCLOPEDIA would have a picture or two not one damn picture in the whole book!!!! Yes it is an indepth read for an older person who still enjoys the magical world and i will be devouring this book by myself it was just disappointing we had great expectations of fantastical artwork and information to go with it.
2,Love the cover of the book,Very disappointing book. Great read but no pitchers inside to match each creature.The cover does not indicate the contents - not one pitchure!
2,no pictures,"The cover makes this ""Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures"" look like tons of fun, but there are no pictures inside! Just text.The authors might point out that ""It's not for kids; it's for serious students of cryptozoology."" Serious students?Brother. Everybody knows these books are pretty much entirely for kids (or at least pre-teens). But even adults like pictures. If you're a ""serious student,"" however, this is still a waste of time: if it's just text you're after, Wikipedia can do what this book times ten -- frequently with pictures.On the other hand, if text alone is okay with you, I would suggest you check outThe Cryptopedia: A Dictionary of the Weird, Strange, and Downright Bizarre, which is much weirder yet far more readable."
5,"Beware of Knock-Off Copies With ""Seaon Ten"" Misspelled","If your ""Season 10"" says ""Seaon 10"" it is probably a Chinese Knock-off copy recorded with fuzzy resolution.I sent the whole collection back and bought authentic ones with entirely different packaging.The originals have a completely different packaging and superior clarity to the copies!Al"
4,Great!,"One of the best series I've seen, along with the series CSI: Miami, and CSI: NY. Recommended for those who like criminology."
2,Not reliable...not recommended,"We have had this scanner for 1 year and it came up with an error message that our computer tech cannot fix so it sits on the desk and gathers dust. It is very slow to warm up, but scans fast after it finally warms up. Sure was a lot of money to pay for something that is slow AND didn't even last a year. Not recommended!"
2,where is my stuff???,"RuPaul's Drag Race: Seasons 2 & 3I ordered this last year on December 14th...and I still havent received it. I know they said it would take a while, but.....whats could be going on???"
5,RU-tastic,I really liked the show and it was a great buy though one of my disks didn't play right in my tv I tried another tv and it worked fine... I never had issues with my tv hooked up to my blue ray player before so idk might be a rare glitch but i'm to lazy to send it back lol and it might be my blue ray player too either way still love it!
1,I did not ever recieve the cd's nor did I write the review listed,"The review stating that I recieved the work files is bogus! The only thing I have recieved from the author is the suggestion that I buy the book again, in order to recieve the cd's. This book is worthless without the work files - I paid $130 for it, and cannot use it. I feel that the author should ship me one of the new books free of charge in order to straighten this out.No communications at all from the author other than unfulfilled promises."
1,Very disappointed,"We bought this book to be used by the employees' of the company. The book is not accompanied by a CD with files to be used during the training process (as most of the tutorial books have) and instead, it has a Student Access Kit. The ""student"" receives an access code and must call the publisher to get the URL of the site where he/she can do all the training exercises using the website and the book. The problem is that they do not allow more than ONE student per book/access code/e-mail.Besides the fact that this practice is (in my opinion) unethical, this fact it is not advertised anywhere so that the buyer to know what he/she will be facing.Just looking through the book, I think it is a waste of money (at least without a CD of access for all companies' employees)."
5,Very helpful for anyone working with kids,"This book was recommended to me by a peer before I started work with academy soccer players, and I have to say that it has proved to be very useful. I had previously worked solely with adults so some research was much needed. Don't be mislead by the colorful and childish cover as it has some great content - both scientific and practical.It is rare to find a science-based book that reads so well cover to cover, but is equally useful as a reference.There are opinions of certain topics such as strength training that could be argued, but then what good book doesn't challenge certain ideas or practices. It is of my belief that children's training is often an afterthought or merely based on adult models when in-fact kids are our future, and so we need to invest more research and effort into programming for them. Getting this book should certainly help you in this process."
5,Shuttlecock quality,These are high quality shuttlecocks and they do last longer than the shuttlecocks that come with the badminton set I purchased. Reasonable cost and it is nice to have extra ones around.
3,nice knife BUT,"I like the looks of the knife in the picture but I'm 6' tall so my hands are not small, guess I should have pulled out a tape measure and checked the size of the handle and the blade, both are to small for me, fits my 19 yr old son great.The quality looks to be good, the handle is a little skinny, blade is fairly sharp.I'll keep it for now and give it to my son when he needs a gut knife.3 stars for size Versses picture size.Good Hunting"
3,The format isn't right on four episodes,"I've always loved this show but somebody messed up the format! for four of the episodes,Too Old To Trick or Treat, Too Young To DieHyde's Christmas RagerAn Eric Forman Christmas(They got it labeled ""Not an Eric Forman Christmas""WinterThose episodes appear small on my tv, the other ones are fine. I'm going to take my original DVD collection for these episodes and make my own custom holiday disc."
5,Holiday Edition of That 70's Show,I never get tired of watching these show. They are so funny and take me back to a great time in my life. I hope to get all episodes!!!!
4,That '70s Show: Holiday Edition,"Given as a gift to add to an already large collection of holiday movies, recipient hasn't advised of any issues."
3,Good overview (text) -- not actually useful to do any datamining,"Pro:Clear, easy to read text that covers many topics of data classification and mining (as described by the several other reviewers).Con:Don't expect to be able to actually perform any of the data mining techniques discussed in the book from (or while) reading it. There is no software that comes along with it, nor does the book champion a specific package that you can use while reading through the chapters. It kind of reminded me of the old Wendy's commercial ""Where's the beef?""Overall:If you're interested in getting a general feel of what data mining has to offer, this is a decent first read. If want to do any of those things, you will need to seek out other sources.I personally found books associated with specific software packages much more useful. Depending on your background, you may be better off skipping straight to them."
2,Not that useful,"Although this book is considered as a standard introductory textbook for data mining classes, in my view it has limited scope. Key issues such as the logic (and perhaps some theory) behind classification and clustering techniques is not presented thoroughly, while there is an extended presentation of association analysis. This is in line with the research interests of the authors of course ( at least that is what I concluded by viewing the reference lists at the end of the chapters - the authors have published extensively in this field). The problem is that association rules are reported by other sources to be less useful than newest algorithms such as collaborative filtering. No coverage on regression exists in the book as well. So in overall I believe there are more useful books to introduce someone on this very interesting and fun field!"
4,Good for fundamental Data Mining Algorithms,"Tan, Steinbach and Kumar did a good job. It is definitely a good read on Data Mining (DM). Pretty much all the fundamental DM algorithms are covered and explained in simplistic fashion. Most of the high level DM algorithms are basically off shoots of one or more of these fundamental DM algorithms, so it is imperative to have a clear understanding of them. This book is very helpful in that regard. It would have been nice if the book covered Support Vector Machine in more detail.Undergraduate level Statistics and Linear Algebra knowledge is needed to understand some concepts covered in the book.Good luck future miners."
4,Useful Book,"This is a recommended book at Stanford University. Overall the book is very good in explaining data mining concepts in terms of simple applications and covers most of the major concepts. It covers the association analysis, clustering and classification techniques quite well.However, this book does not go deep in some of the concepts in mathematical terms and the reasons some methods work and others don't. I wish it were more deep. The mathematical / statistical details could have been put at least in the appendix.However, overall, it is a good reference book. I suggest combining this book with other data mining books."
4,It DOES work...almost.,"I have used this CD many a time to send myself to sleep after a stressful day. The music is very calming and euphoric but the HUGE, MASSIVE noise of crashing waves and the violent tide can kind of keep you wide awake and alert. I reckon that Solitudes should have lowered the volume on the waves a bit. Whether thru speakers or headphones, the tide will always come through loud. If you can ignore this, you'll crash out."
2,Probably the most stimulating relaxation CD I've ever heard,"Points for the concept, but this CD kept me awake! The crashing waves are loud and distracting, even on low volume, and the music frankly a little depressing. I actually found myself getting agitated listening to it. Then again, I had some of the worst nights' sleep ever during a vacation in Belize in which I camped on the beach for a week. Oddly enough, Gibson's Ocean Sounds works better for me, probably because there the waves are gently washing up on shore rather than smacking into rocks. If you are used to ocean sounds then Natural Sleep Inducement may work for you, but if you're landlocked like me you may not find it as helpful."
5,Wonderful!,"This is truly a great CD. I usually cannot stand so-called ""relaxation"" CD's--they always put me on edge. But this one is truly phenomenal--soothing sounds and music, with carefully designed ""binaural"" rythms that really do induce sleep."
5,Love this CD...my favorite of all sleep CD's,"I've listened to this CD for years. Originally bought it at a store locally, over time with my daughter playing her CD's and the in's & out's of the CD it became scratched, I was happy to find it here again at Amazon with free shipping. I think the subtle music and the waves combined makes for the perfect background sleeping ""white noise"". LOVE this CD! Tried others for variety, but always come back to this one!!"
5,My first album from Solitudes,"I love this CD. My sister had it, this was the first time when I was first introduced to solitudes. The music is profoundly relaxing. Although it was my first CD by Solitudes it wasn't my last. Sample Stream of Dreams."
2,Nice music and a lot of noise,"I can't believe that this CD is intended to help you get to sleep. The music is nice, but those waves crashing and grinding over it ruin the whole effect. How is anyone supposed to get any sleep with all that noise? It's more nerve racking than sleep inducing."
5,DADDY'S GIRL IS SOMETHING ABOUT AN ANGEL,"""Daddy's Girl"" has been revised under the name of ""Something About an Angel"". This book has a divine purpose and that purpose is to heal victims all over the world. I pray that someone is helped in their healing process by reading it. The author, Linda D. Wattley"
3,No excuse for this much trans fat,"Big Train's mixes taste pretty good, but there's no excuse for the huge amounts of trans fat they contain. Partially hydrogenated coconut oil -- pure trans fat -- is listed as one of the first ingredients! (The nutritional information posted by Amazon must be for a different product, because it incorrectly claims that the product contains zero trans fat... not possible with that ingredient list.) According to a nutritionist friend, even made with skim milk they are, nutritionally, heart attack city. (I'm surprised that they haven't changed their formulas simply so that they can be sold in the city of New York.) And I don't want Big Train to give me a big caboose. So, I'm holding off on buying more of this. I'll mix up my own smoothies until they make their product more healthy."
2,Nice price but fades fast,Well the smell is nice since I was looking for something light and clean but does not last more than an hour so really not worth it. I will continue to use my obsesssion even though it is heavier I know it will not fade as fast as this does and I still get compliments. Is there an oil based version of cool water? If so it would last longer and I would be happy with that.
3,The smell...,"I got the cologne relatively fast and it was pretty cheap, however I am not a big fan of it. I would not use it daily because the scent is not me, if you like it great, however I will stick with my actually good smelling Adidas Dare...Men's Adidas Dare by Adidas Eau de Toilette - 1.7 oz."
1,Wrong thing delivered,"I am sure that its a great product, but the problem is that I ordered the spray for men and we got the spray for women."
1,I just don't trust it....,"As a previous patient of Dr. Mercola, I experienced being put on a program which basically drained me financially. A high number of tests were recommended and taken, and one treatment ended up being very painful for me, which I later found out was completely unnecessary. Needless to say, I had a very bad experience at his clinic, spent lots of money (nothing was covered by insurance), and got no better. It's difficult for me to trust what this person says or writes. Also, the products he recommends are the same ones he sells via certain manufacturers/distributors through his website. He's a business like any other business, and what is the bottom line for most businesses? I'm sure we all know that one..."
3,Hunter-gatherer Diet,This diet makes sense.Follow the profit for big business. High carb diets with lots of cheap to grow grain or a natural hunter-gatherer diet. Large amounts of grains in our diet are a historically recent addition.
1,"unrealistic, not time tested","There are other books by M.D.s which are time tested and deal with insulin resistance in a realistic way. Familiar with the odd things Mercola sells on his website; it looks like one more ""new old just rearranged"" diet book that contributes no new science to the topic, essentially a rehash of lots of other books in my opinion. I think the public deserves more than just claims and recipes to pad out a mighty flimsy book that purports to be about serious health challenges."
2,unrealistic,"I think the book is good and although I am not a physician, I trust what he is saying in the book, just find it unrealistic. My day is full. I look for time to just plain relax. How am I suppose to follow these restrictive diets and cook or eat plenty of vegetables when time is of the essence? Until this country adopts vegetables as a necessary option (in fast food restaurants for example) these diets are unrealistic. At least for me. Personally, I find it easier to exercise three times a week and try to eat as healthy as possible. But the diet recommended in this book is for either people with enough time on their hands or people with plenty of money to eat at restaurants with healthy food. Dr. Mercola may be a good physician but he is unrealistic in his views. He also promotes a no vaccine policy. Is this a good idea? Makes me wonder..."
1,Questionable...,"On his Internet site Dr. Joseph Mercola writes """"""""if do NOT regularly eat high amounts of the following foods, then your likelihood of being vitamin K2 deficient is still very high: Goose liver pté""""""""... What kind of physician would recommend anyone to increase their calcium by suffering other creatures... wow, wow, wow. Really, wow, then he is trying to sell you a book."
2,Too complicated and expensive,"I follow Dr. Mercola and find a lot of good advice and ideas for keeping healthy, but I thought his book was too complicated and I was disappointed. I try to eat as healthy as possible and buy organic when I can. Unfortunately organic is often times too expensive. If I can't afford grass fed or organic meat, that leaves me with zero options. So all that is left is some vegetables, a few fruits, and no grains.If you live on a small budget or fixed income, it's very hard to afford organic foods. The bad foods are cheap and that is probably why people are eating so unhealthy."
3,Just read the title,"There's really not much in the book of value, save for the title itself. Stay away from grains--from most carbohydrates, really--and you'll be fine. But please do check out the author's website for some of the best information available on the internet. Mercola.com: now that's highly recommended... - lc"
2,Is no-grain the solution for your health?,"Remember the Japanese eat more grain(s) than the Americans, but they live longer."
1,No Pizza. No Beer. No Fun,"You may lose weight following this diet. But, at what cost? No Pizza. No Beer. No fun."
2,Good info; time-consuming diet plan,"Dr. Mercola gives his readers worthwhile health explanations and advice but his diet plan is too restrictive and time-consuming to easily follow. Instead, I recommend Going Against the Grain: How Reducing and Avoiding Grains Can Revitalize Your Health by Melissa Diane Smith. It is easier to understand and its diets and recipes are simple, tasty and a breeze to follow. I'm an avid reader of health books and both of these books cover important information for health maintenance. But Ms. Smith's book, Going Against the Grain, deals with a much broader range of health problems associated with grains and is the book I believe people would prefer."
5,Just like new and a great book!,"This is an excellent book. Dr. Mercola is not afraid to speak the truth about grains and sugars or anything that concerns our health and welfare. For most people, our bodies can't handle all the grain and starch that we are told to eat by the FDA and the food pyramid. So many people could lose weight, get rid of stomach and bowel problems, protect themselves against cancer if they'd get off the grain. Animals are fed grain and corn to do what? Yep--that's right--fatten them up! They do the same to us. Animals were meant to eat grass, not grain. ""Healthy grains"" should be used sparingly with ""healthy"" people--those with no issues with weight or health. Read the book for more information and the reasons why and check out his website at [....] ! Loved it."
5,Great book,"Very good book describing grain addiction. This book is an eye-opener that really describes how people can get trapped into the 'grain addiction' and become so unhealthy/overweight. Definitely a good read, read it and get healthy!"
2,No Grain Diet,"too complex, confusing, More than a lifestyle change, I don't doubt it works but not for me or my family."
5,This is key information.,"More books have come out recently on this subject but this was an early gem. It's so simple but works so perfectly. Stop eating grains and you'll begin dropping inches and pounds and not be hungry. When you tell people to cut out carbs, many people are confused but telling someone to stop all grains is very clear and produces rapid results. Dr.Mercola includes a number of techniques and snacks to make this go painlessly. Once you see the results you will get blown away."
3,not very simple to read,"There is a lot of information in the book that I don't find particularly helpful. Not a lot of good recipes which is fine. I find the listing of grains & substances that are grain-like but not considered to be grains, to be a bit confusing. Do I eat them or not if I am following a no-grain diet? Not an easy read."
2,NOT STICKING to their promise or ANYTHING,"Lotta Jansdotter is clearly talented, which is apparent in her work.The negative of this item is not from her artistic ability but from the production side of retail.The adhesive on the labels seems to disappear once they are removed from the original sheet.I would not mail a letter or parcel with these used as the label... the mail will surely not make it to its destination; the label might not even make it to the post office (falling off before).The box is presented well, and Jansdotter's designs are simple yet divine. As far as functionality, these labels are not sticking to their promise (to stick) or to anything else for that matter.I would choose another of Jansdotter's products in place of this one."
2,Less than expected,"I am not sure what I was expecting but the quality was not up to par. The unit is very flimsy, during instillation the main bezel difficult to handle because it could not take any stress. The hardware while serviceable is very ""mickey mouse"". The mounting screws (little balls with threads) are difficult to handle and the thread depth is not very deep.The cost was reasonable but I would look at other options before purchasing another.Costco has a similar unit that I used in another project and it was great for about the same cost."
2,Not working well with the go-green CFL light bulbs,"I have installed these in the kids play room. The bottom part of this fixture is too small to dispense the heat generated by a CFL bulb base. After a few hours, the CFL would get too hot and turn-off. Once I switched back to incandescent lights, then it is ok.The glass shades is definitely match the price of this product, not very high quality."
1,Not Worth Buying,"Poor sizing and very poor quality. Waay large, esp. in the butt, thin material,cheap zipper, waist gathers don't stay. I sent 'em back and ordered some different ones."
3,Great Beginning,Just Does not follow through for me. The first half of the book held me in suspense and as the mystery built I wanted to know what happened more and more. The ending however I feel was tied up rather quickly and was kind of obvious. The author did leave a window open for a sequel so I am curious to know what happens next.
3,Okay.,I purchased this book because it was a good price. I was not expecting it to be great but it was something good to read.
3,Fast Paced Read,"I saw this book was free for my Kindle, so I figured: Why not take a look. I like adventure stories and this falls in that category. The premise in the plot is a bit of a stretch, but, that having been said, it was a good quick read. I liked the descriptions of hiking in Nepal and the travels in Africa. This is a good book to read on a long plane ride. Certainly for me at least, the price was right."
5,An interesting historical account of an incredible trek.,"While this book can sometimes run a little dry, it is nonetheless a fascinating account of an incredible trek across a large part of the country that I am familiar with. Places, names, and events are well detailed, and the author brings forth good insights as well."
5,When the Bough Breaks is a Bomshell,"I've read a handful of Kellerman books - all of them being on the fairly recent end of the spectrum, with my clear favorite being ""Rage."" I thought the plot of his debut novel sounded very intriguing so I found it at the library. I was BLOWN AWAY. I can't believe this was a first novel. It is decidedly the BEST JK novel I have read so far. I guess this is one of those novelists whose earlier works are better, rather than improving with time. The plot twists were a surprise to me and I was impressed by how many details went into this intricately-woven story, especially for a first effort. Lastly (and this is what drove me to write this review) this was the BEST ENDING I have ever read in any book. I absolutely LOVED how it ended. PERFECT!! So for that, Jon, I thank you."
4,Can't Put it Down,"I picked up this book on a whim at a flea market, and felt I was being a little morbid picking up a book about child abusers. I quickly fell in love with Dr. Alex Delaware--I keep hoping I can find a doctor like him in real life--and also Milo Sturgis. I've read several books in this series, and while they can be read out of order, I've found there are numerous little side comments and references that you'll only get if you've read them in order. You'll definitely want to read them all anyway--some are better than others, but all are good reading, and I still thing When the Bough Breaks is one of the best."
5,he's great,"this was the first of his books that i read, as soon as it was in paperback....got me hooked!!"
5,A Cognitive Feast,"Dr. K writes like butter melts. This is my first.....of his books I mean. I could not put it down, reading it like a long cool drink in Texas heat. I share his clinical speciality, as I hope to one day share just an ounce of his writing skills. Bravo, dear Doc!"
2,Overrated,"This was a disappointing read. While the plot is generally good, the writing is uneven and bloated. The book is crying out for better editing. Kellerman is unsparing in taking advantage of every opportunity for cliche and simile."
3,OK but Kellerman has done better,"Perhaps I can illustrate my thoughts on ""When the Bough Breaks"" this way. I read a lot and so sometimes I have to search for books I have not read by known authors. It turns out this is the second time I have read this book. I bought it this time because I did not remember the story from the preview. As I started to write this review I had to go back and review the preview to remember the story. So I would classify this as an ok read but not at all memorable."
4,Retired English Teacer,"Good early Kellerman. I got to see how Sturgis and Delaware began their connection. I like the combination of the two characters, and the book is well written. I now have read several books by Kellerman."
2,It was good until the conclusion,"Enjoyable read until the author brought up every character in the book in the summary of the case. He even went so far as to refer to characters by their last names throughout most of the book, and then referred to them by their first names in the summation. It really irritated me, because up until that point, I liked the book! It ruined the end, in my opinion."
2,strange style,"The story isn't bad, but the reader makes the whole thing unrealistic. It does not seem right to have a successful psychologist speak and sound like Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe. Music reduces rather than increases the tension. There are really much better audio books out there."
2,Far-fetched and disappointing mystery,"This is one of the most far-fetched, outrageous mysteries I've ever read. Alex Delaware is a thirty-something, retired, child psychologist. When his cop friend asks him to help on a murder case, the good doctor suddenly becomes a sleuth asking questions with no apparent purpose. His questioning leads him from one seemingly unrelated death to another. All of a sudden, our novice detective is racing for his life from a motorcycle assassin, wrestling with a powerful athlete, and brandishing a gun while talking like Bogart. The conspiracy plot just isn't believable either--a group of pedophiles running a children's home? And they all happened to be college buddies? Come on. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Five reasons why I disliked the book...,"1. I felt as if I were being talked down to--and looked down upon--by the author throughout the entire story. 2. There were continual references to the hero's intellectual and professional ""brillance""; and since our hero is a psychologist just like Kellerman himself is in real life, I kept getting the icky feeling that I was witness to some sort of vicarious ego trip for the author. 3. Often the dialogue comes off as a lecture or lesson. 4. The main character showed little regard for the feelings and situations of the other characters. 5. The story culminates with a kind of improbable perfect-timing luck that makes me question the author's creative effort."
3,QUICK REFUND,WE DIDN'T THINK THE PRODUCT'S CONDIITON MATCHED THE DESCRIPTION BUT THE SELLER QUICKLY (AND WITHOUT MY ASKING) REFUNDED THE FULL AMOUNT.I HAVE BOUGHT ITEMS FROM THEM IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.
4,Pschologist/Action Hero,"This is Jonathan Kellerman's first novel featuring Dr. Alex Delaware, an over-achieving child psychologist who suffered from burnout in his early 30's and dropped out. The novel reads as though Kellerman is just having some fun writing. Fortunately, he takes his readers along for the ride.Dr. Delaware goes from mild-mannered chid psychologist to psychologist/sleuth to psychologist/action hero as the story progresses.Not all of the characters are as fully developed as I might have liked, but there were just too many characters to develop them all fully. The characterizations provided, however, were fairly good. Check Kellerman's later works to see how he expands and develops this talent.The pacing was good, but there was a little too much deux ex machina to make the story truly believable. It's such a good read, however, I didn't really mind."
3,"""The kind of book that establishes a career in one stroke""","My review title is the same as that of Newsday's review of the first novel featuring psychologist Alex Delaware and his offbeat police detective partner, Milo Sturgis. A prominent psychiatrist, Dr. Morton Handler, has been found brutally murdered. Sturgis himself also has a double homicide to investigate and, with Delaware's help, they begin to unravel a forty-year-old conspiracy in the City of Angels. Tying the plot together is seven-year-old Melody Quinn, who may hold clues as to why anyone would want to kill Dr. Handler. The plot revolves around sexual child abuse, which is a deeply troubling subject, and there is a fairly squicky scene near the end that almost made me put the book down and walk away. I'm glad I didn't, because this odd couple pairing of Delaware and Sturgis has lasted for many books now, and each one is more readable than the previous one."
4,Another great mystery,"A Jim Jones type leader, psychologoical manipulation, and turns and twists around every corner make this another strong showing for Kellerman. Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis find themselves in over their heads in this one. Will either make it out alive? What are the secrets Jedson college is hiding? How do they connect with the Gentleman's Brigade which is much more than it seems?Great, but distrubing story from Kellerman. If you like mystery and suspense pick it up now."
3,"Great book, abridged audio version not as good.","Read the book several years ago. Listened to the abridged audio version recently. It was alright, but too ""abridged"" for my taste. The narrator, John Rubinstein, did a great job. I really like all of Jonathan K's books, especially the ones featuring Alex Delaware. Advise you to get the unabridged version if decide to listen rather than read."
4,Wonderful reading!!,"Have always loved Alex Delaware, now my goal is to read all in order. This book has me ready to read the next"
4,Kin's Review,"This is the first book in Kellerman's Alex Delaware series. I'm a strong believer in reading any series books in order to make sure I get all the background. This is a good thriller with lots of characters. Alex Delaware is a young psychiatrist that has given up his practice after a particularly upsetting case. He then gets involved with the murder investigation of Dr. Morton Handler, another psychiatrist. The police have no leads, and the only possible witness is a seven-year-old girl. It's Alex's job to try and unlock the terrible secret buried in Melody's memory. As the story unfolds there are more secrets and a deep conspiracy that no one could have imagined.I look forward to the next book in the series."
4,cable good,good for extension in garage for an in house car radio setup for hd eventually works great fits a tight space where needed
2,"Boring, outdated, poorly illustrated, awkward phrasing","I've hit the key problems with this book in my review title. Rather than expound on these, I would like to instead suggest a few alternate books that I have enjoyed:Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations and ExcursionsNumber Words and Number Symbols: A Cultural History of NumbersThe VNR Concise Encyclopedia of MathematicsThe World of Mathematics: A Four-Volume SetBon appetit!"
4,Good Product,It has been very cold and rainy lately but on the sunny days...No Cats! in my backyard. I think the product is working. Someone completed a review by suggesting to use an old pill bottle with cotton. Fill the container ever so slightly and punch holes in the top of the cap /bottle and the scent will last longer. I would have given five stars but no instructions were included when I received the product.
3,"Seemed to work initially, but afterwards","Seemed to work when I first put about 6 open containers in my yard. Didn't have any criters for awhile, actual I heard there were some coyote sitings in our neighborhood around the same time, so maybe they were attracted by the urine. The urine stopped working after the first success. It didn't smell as much after the first attempt so maybe it lost it's potence. The Seller was amazing though, great customer service as the original shipment was delivered incorrectly by the post office, they sent me a new shipment at no cost. Would buy from them again."
2,Great to see him back in action but this is not his finest hour.,"Andy Fraser was one of the greatest blues-rock bassists of the late 60's/early 70's and made his name with Free. He's actually an excellent singer as well and since leaving Free in 1972 (where his vocal talents were obscured by the prowess of the mighty Paul Rodgers) has infrequently released some classic soulful rock music in the 1970's and early 80's. I really wanted to love this CD but I can't. Musically 'Naked' has a Sting vibe to it and Andy's voice sounds great. Unfortunately, this release is quite ponderous and bland. He's obviously comfortable and proud of his lifestyle but one would expect some real energy to emerge. Instead every song sounds similar and, considering its his first album since 1984, you'd think he'd come out fighting. I hope he has more music in his future and we won't have to wait so long for the next one. But I also hope Andy brings a little more energy to the party next time."
1,"What happened???..""Stripped Down"" is more like it!","I am a long time Free fan as well as a fan of Andy's earlier solo releases....NONE OF THAT HERE!! This is a boring waste of time. This belongs on FM radio! Fake drums, the works. No talent displayed here. Andy, I'm afraid you spent too much time focusing on an ""Out Of The Closet"" celebration, and not enough time on what you used to do best..Create real Rock!! Long time fans, leave this alone!"
3,Healing Hands = healing music!,"This C.D. is worth the price because of the incredible song ""Healing Hands"".Also produced as a video, which brings me to joyful tears every time I see it, Healing Hands is my personal anthem for Coming Out.Kudos to Andy Fraser for celebrating in such a musically satisfying style his own Coming Out process!"
5,Nice Air Adventure,"This is a great flying story originally published in the 1939 January issue of Five Novels Monthly. It's historical fiction and the story takes you back in time. I highly recommend the audiobook. It's fun to listen to and the story comes to life with the ""Jinx"" (the great voice of Jennifer Aspen). It's full cast and the interplay of the voice actors is great. The sound effects are real and the music is pulling you right into the action. So for two hours you will forget your freeway traffic and reminisce back to the good old days of radio drama with Johnny Brice being being hounded by the ""Jinx"".Trouble on His Wings (Stories from the Golden Age)"
5,Trouble on his Wings,"In this tale, Johnny Brice is a hard-working picture chaser and top reporter. Well, until his luck was no more... There is Jinx that changed all that as when she enters his life, all seems to go wrong. The moment she steps aside, things are going better. Yet when he allows her to join him and his co-worker back in the team, there is trouble again! And who is she?"
4,Not just another Portuguese-English Dictionary,"This compact issue of the NTC's Portuguese and English Dictionary provides the same comprehensive treatment found in other NTC's dictionaries. The entries cover words from typical situations in domestic and everyday life, arts, industry and technology, sport and recreation, as well as fauna and flora. An invaluable supplement to any Portuguese-English dictionary and useful not only to students, but also to a wide range of business people and translators who have to deal with Portuguese-English translation concerns, taking into account Brazilian and European Portuguese variants. A book to have at hand..."
2,Total Disappointment,"This Compact Portuguese and Englsh Dictionary is absolutely NOTHING like what you've come to expect from NTC. There are no explanations that elaborate on the definitions so as to make the various nuances of words clear, or to demonstrate how they are used or what they refer to. In my opinion, this dictionary was poorly made, nor is it up to the normal standards of NTC."
4,Interesting early progressive rock,"This album came out at about the same time as ""In the court of the crimson king"" (King Crimson). Side A contained only one long piece about a shipwreck with narrating voice and a lot of interesting musical ideas. Very good. Side B is however more mainstream and less good. But I gave it 4 stars just because I like the A side so much. Like a more melodic King Crimson or a more progressive Moody Blues."
4,Good but strange,"Well, very unusual and interesting book. Unusual, because photos of Paris are given under different angles. Interesting, because...simply interesting to look at famous places sometimes at 360 degrees view.However, this book has one disadvantage or may be I did not understand the idea of authors. At the end the book there are all photos in small size and black-white color (back pictures). But sometimes the pickup angles of back pictures do not agree with the same pictures in the book. For example, back picture is of 180 degree view, and real photo is 90 degree. Therefore, you feel that there is a flaw of the book. As for the rest, I liked it."
1,The Title is Misleading,"This CD fails a threshhold test: the title is grossly misleading. It is NOT ""Songbirds at Sunrise,"" but bird song overlaid with human music. I bought it because I wanted birdsong, and was beyond disappointed. If you want birdsong together with elevator music, buy it. I would have given it zero stars but that was not an option."
5,Traditional skills and new techniques,"Storey's Country Wisdom bulletins contain practical, hands-on instructions designed to help you master dozens of country living skills quickly and easily.Storey has managed to pack a lot of great information and techniques into this and the other bulletins that I have purchased over the years.Check out the other dog and cat bulletins too."
1,Poor quality & very little information,"I bought this book hoping to get some helpful tips on how to crate-trained my chihuahua, but instead of ""HOW TO"", there're tons of common-sense type information like ""why it's important to crate-train....""! In addition, I'm very disappointed with the printing quality. It's acuatlly not a book, but booklet!!"
2,Very little information,Book is not worth buying. Found very little information in it. I would not recommend this. A well written puppy training book has much more information in it.
1,Crate Training Your Dog,This book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"If you want to learn about crate training your puppy, buy a book about raising your specific breed of dog or get a copy of How to Raise a Puppy You Can Live With. This 'book' (I would call it a pamphlet!) does not have any information that any decent book on raising puppies does not."
1,STALE,When I opened this packae to place it in the cage for my birds all the seed fell off the stcik to the bottom of the cage which at the time was not very clean...... turned out to be a waste of money.
2,Not what I expected,"This was supposed to be an ultra extended battery.It did not come in an enclosed package and I am wondering if its even new. It works fine, just like my original battery"
2,"Worked the first few charge cycles, then went haywire","I have a 2 year old Treo 700wx. The battery arrived in June in just a clear plastic bag leading me to believe it was not a new battery. It worked fine the first few (less than a dozen) charge cycles but then starting acting odd. It would charge up 100% sometimes and not at all other times. Now it charges to maybe 40%. However, it shows on screen as not charged at all when I first unplug it. I have to remove the battery and put it back in before I see that correct charge amount. Even at 40%, it loses its charge quickly. I'm going to buy the Treo 800 shortly so I'm living with this situation for now (and bringing my charger with me everywhere)."
3,BATTERIES DID LITTLE FOR MY TREO 700P,"I purchased 2 new batteries for my Treo 700P. First, they didn't appear to look as new as the ones I was getting rid of. They may be brand new but they don't look like it.More importantly, they haven't added a minute on to the active life of my Treo. In fact, the batteries that I have been using for one year seem to provide as much or more talk and standby time than these new ones. Not a good situation, frankly. While there may be issues with how my Treo is drawing power, it would seem like these batteries are not high quality, new ones or you would think I'd be getting a better result."
1,Bill,"OEM Palm Treo Battery for 650 700p 700w 700wx SprintThe battery seems to last basically as long as my old one I have been using for a year. When it was new with the phone it lasted the entire day, now my old battery barely makes it to when I get home from work. My new battery doesn't last any longer. I don't think my phone is using any more energy now verses when it was new.Bill C."
1,Beatles don't act like Beatles,"I really thought that this would be a fun book--but it's only fun if the charactors act like they would in real life. In this book, Beatles don't act like Beatles. They hardly reacted to one of their beloved own dying. It was all about the business and keeping it going. The actual mythology at the time (there were Paul is dead society magazines out)-had to do with their profound grief and spiritual connection so that they could sort of resurrect the real Paul through Billy Shears. In this story the Beatles are afraid that the companies in control could replace any of them. Give me a break!!It's too simplistic to be intriguing."
2,Worst dialogue ever,"Although interesting for it's topic, and clever in the way it manages to take on board the various Paul Is Dead clues, it hardly ever surpasses the level of a mediocre school essay.The dialogue (and there is plenty of it) in the book is the worst I've ever read. The attempt of creating a 'typical' UK accent fails completely and the pace of the book is completely wrong in a number of places."
2,Live and Let Die,"OK, it's an entertaining read, but for those of us living on the European side of the Atlantic the UK described here bears no resemblance to the real place. And of course, Americans never get British speech patterns right. Shades of Dick Van Dyke doing a terrible cockney accent in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang - a film regarded as not suitable for nervous English kids, X rated!"
5,Awsome song! Even better car in the video!,Hey!Check out the video that is on this CD single! It has an awoms car in it!... MINE!!! :) It's a Viper Red 1967 Nova that you can see Mark sitting in in parts of the video! :) So check it out!!
5,Everyone should read this book,"This is a little-known but delightful gem of a book. The inimitable Eleanor Roosevelt was a prolific author, but this effort is among her very best. Forged by adversity throughout her life, Eleanor was born into a privileged, wealthy family. Her father, Elliot, was Theodore Roosevelt's brother.My favorite chapter is ""The Right to Be an Individual."" Mrs. Roosevelt stresses that individuality is something to be prized, yet people want to remain safe, surrounded by a group. She stresses we should strive against this and always be true to ourselves. This is a simple, yet eloquent philosophy. The entire book is full of wit, wisdom and some profound bits of advice. I am a better person for having read this book and I think everyone can take something meaningful from its pages."
4,Timeless Advice,"Honestly, I don't have much to add to what all the other reviewers are saying...this is a great little book (just a smudge over 200 pages) that is full of tidbits of advice, some that are very forward thinking, since the original book was published in 1960. My only minor complaint is that some of the advice does feel a bit ""fluffy"", without much meat behind it to really feel like something I can implement in my own life. Nonetheless, this easy reading book does remind us all of how to enjoy life and to strive to reach our full potential."
2,A bit disappointed,I love the way Eleanor Roosevelt looks at life...some of her quotes are my favorites...ever! That said...I was disappointed that this book didn't have more of her quotes. I guess that's what I am really looking for...a book of her quotes. Sadly this book was not it.
4,Love Eleanor!,I love anything about the most fascinating lady. She was a pioneer in her time! I highly recommend her autobiography as well
3,TMNT,"This book is a great book. Thanks to my wonderful girlfriend, and her choice of getting it for me. All in all, it's a very interesting book, the only complaint I have for it is that it should have a little more actual context. In other words, more words. I didn't like the fact that after a few chapters it gets kind of repetative because of the lack of reading, if your into just the comic book sketches then this is it for you. If you want some more depth to the actual writing, then you probably won't be fully satisfied. I would recomend a read of course, and a buy for the TMNT enthusiast but other than my gripes, GREAT book."
3,"Interesting, but I wish it had more info","This is an interest book for TMNT fans, but I wish it had more information on the development of the turtles and their history. The book focuses mostly on the comics and Eastman's sketches. It has early drafts of the characters. In that sense, it isn't really an autobiography at all, but rather more like a scrapbook. Fans of the 1987 cartoons will be sorely disappointed. I hope someday Eastman and Laird come out with a definitive memoir. This book is great for fans of the comics, but isn't the memoir I hoped it would be.FYI, you can get a digital copy of the book from Eastman's website (or Heavy Metal Magazine) for a fraction of the price."
4,Insider look at the literary scene from the 1930's to the 1970's,"For the three people who might be interested in Rexroth's exchange of letters with his editor, Laughton, this should be of interest. It's funny, crazy, absurd, and informative. Perhaps in a few centuries, it will take on some significance again."
5,Why is it deleted?,"This fabulous edition of Music Man includes several numbers I had not heard before. Noble is fabulous as Harold Hill. He can handle the patter brilliantly, and he still has a good voice to really sing the songs that need to be sung. The sound is spectacular - hey, it's Telarc. This is every bit as good as the original cast album, and better than the soundtrack - which has some rewritten songs that are not as good as the originals. Now if only Telarc would bring this back to the catalogue. How about their budget series?"
5,THIS BOOK RULES!!!,"THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED FOR HOURS! I FOUND IT HARD TO PUT DOWN. THE AUTHOR REALLY DID HIS HOMEWORK FOR THIS BOOK. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE SPORT ""FACTALCOHOLIC""!"
3,"Dry Textbook, Requires Effort","Mr. Demos certainly did a tremendous amount of research in preparing this work, as his information is plentiful, organized, and lends support to his theories.However, one should be warned that the writing style is quite dry, his refences to numbers and factoids are unending, and the entertainment quotient of the book is near zero. As a reference volume, there are plenty of interesting tables and charts to glean. As a flowing, historical piece that tells a story which brings the Old Colony's residents to life, it is lacking."
5,I highly recomend it.,Although written in 1970 it provides an interesting look at every aspect of colonial life in New England. I highly recomend it for everyone interested in this period of history. Academic but not boring.
2,uneven,"Usually I avoid buying anthologies and I cannot say this book convinced me I am wrong.First of all two of the stories are horror and not fantasy, not even dark fantasy. The sense of an anthology is to regroup the same genre and even if you disagree with this the cover states this book be a collection of queer fantasy short stories.No one of the tales is a real hit: Wizard's Moon is fairly interesting but needs more polishing; Candleglow is about the same only a bit confused by the richness of events. Persephone Ascending has enormous potential but suffer under the ovious restraint of space and in fact we are told the author is working to expand it.Once Upon a Time, Messenger, Centauri and Midnight Confession are interesting but severely flawed.I do not wish to be misunderstood: these attempts are not unworthy, they have their merit and are better written than many novels around: simply they are not worth all the money the book costs."
4,Yum! I could eat with a spoon...or my hands...,"Being of an alternative bent myself, I was looking forward to this anthology. I was pleased to find homosexual fiction that was not only the usual pornography without plot, but combined with my favorite genre, fantasy.My faves, in ascending order:Once Upon A Time. A charming fairy tale with a bit of wit and wry humor that reminded me of Shrek.Candleglow. A Jane Austen tale if told by Oscar Wilde. Delightfully Regency.Persephone Ascending. This should indeed be a full-length novel. Ms. Searls writing style is that of a cheerfully demented Jules Verne. That's a good thing."
1,Not a Good Read,I compare all books of war in the near future with the writings of Sir John Hackett. This work fails that test miserably. Wish I had not bought it.
3,Terrible Editing,"The book is a good read, Berryman brings up many solid points concerning China's almost hegemony in manufacturing. His connecting of the many ""factoid dots"" to draw the conclusions that he does is interesting and scary to say the least. A good read.However, what was a good read is almost destroyed by the sloppy editing of the type. Many words left out of sentences, inapprpriate words used in the sentences. Huge spaces between words in a paragraph, etc. Believe me, I am not an english major or a grammar expert (just ask any of my teachers), but these mistakes are glaring and really slow down the read."
3,Does any publisher edit or proof anymore?,"As a general trend, I have noticed that more and more books are being published nowadays with some pretty glaring editing and/or proofing mistakes. This work, however, absolutely takes the cake. After awhile, I started to see if I could find a page without an error....there were very few. Its not that I'm a perfectionist...far from it...but the mistakes are so jarring its extremely distracting and takes a lot away from the story. Editing should never be outsourced to any country that does not have english as a primary language."
2,2013,Just finished this book and the story is plauseable but there are so many editing errors it is a very hard read. Many lines are repeated in the next paragraph and the flow of the story seems to keep breaking up
2,Thank goodness for the Republican Party!!,There is a story in here but it is hidden amongst long rambling right wing preaching/world view which is not only irritating to a non-American but will also put non republicans right off. Parts of the story are well written and work well but you lose the sence of time as you go further in to the book. I also found the total lack of compassion by the main characters for the millions of deaths going on in the world disturbing to the point I gave up on the story. This is no where near Tom Clancy or Larry Bond and not nearly as subtle.
3,Entertaining,"It's a good, entertaining read and well worth the price of a Kindle copy. Frankly, I found the geopolitical assumptions in this book a bit hard to accept, but then, it's a fictional work and a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is expected from any reader of such novels. If you're expecting a Tom Clancy quality novel, you will be somewhat disappointed, but it is worth the read nonetheless."
1,Misleading title...,"Overall, I cannot say that this is a good book on the subject of Hamilton artists. It's quite obvious from the very first chapter that the book is more conerned with the works of only two individuals, and neither of them are actually from Hamilton! One is a Burlington native and the other comes from Toronto. I was trying to find general information on artists who were actually from Hamilton. This book's title made it sound like that's what it was about, but the book's content was a different story and ended up leaving me very diappointed."
5,"Tons of PM&R facts, right at your fingertips",I peruse this book almost everyday and have already started aging the pages!!! The ability to have detailed information relevant to our specialy at my fingertips has increased the working database of my memory exponentially. Thanks !!!
5,Great resource for keeping in your white coat!,"I bought this to keep it my white coat. I haven't taken PM&R boards yet, but other residents swear that you will pass your boards by just memorizing this book! I can't attest to the validity of that statement, but it definitely highlights how other PM&R residents feel about it. Highly recommended."
3,A Beautiful Song -- but One of Despair,"Ms. McLachlan's song is marvelously performed, but has anyone studied the darkness of the lyrics? They utter the cry of despondency and despair in the hopes that the Death Angel will usher the dying into something better. That's deluded wishful thinking at its best and deception at its worst within the context of her lyrics. Too bad she did not pen something of uplifting hope. It's out there, but don't look to the Death Angel to find it for you."
3,It isn't worth the even little money.,"This is a decent song, but doesn't deserve to have its own single. It is not worth the money for one song I don't even care for and isn't that great, especcially for cheering someone up."
5,thanks for coming out with such a beautiful song.,Hi..My name is Bill. I'd like to thank you for coming out with such a beautiful and touching song. It just so happened to be released at the time when my father-in-law's death and it made the perfect song at his funeral.. Also I really appreciate a song that help make it easier for me and my wife. Thank You again..Bill..
4,blisters that feel good.,"i picked up this cd becasue someone on the curve website recommended it. i absolutely love it. jaymes bullet is beautiful, mistifying, and emotional. her voice is so pleasant, so sultry-sweet. the lyrics actually have some thought behind them, and the whole album sems to tell a story, from the first song to the last. highlights include: ""killer"" - which has a heavy roiling guitar riff and, i think, is a mockery of society and youth - is an excellent rocker. ""melancholy"", by contrast, is a tune which turns loveconfusion into poetry and melodious bliss. it's fascinating. i like the way she mixes technology with emotion. i highly recommend this cd. she has a website which is really cool..."
2,disappointed by not finding useful hints I could use,This book was very basic. I had heard everything before. I was looking for a challenge in order to fight off the effects of the illness. I have read many better books on the subject.
2,One-dimensional story line lacking humor,"I bought this book based on the good reviews I read in Amazon. The book is mediocre in my opinion. The story is about a woman that slowly becomes like her dog, and the dog that slowly becomes like her owner. You would think with that plot the book would be entertaining and funny. Unfortunately, the author did not explore the concept with wit or humor. So the book is just a series of vignettes with no character development (other than the transformation), and after you finish it you feel disappointed that there was not more to it than that.I only read it once to my children and I don't feel like reading it again. My kids (4 and 5) have not asked for it again.Get yourself a Bill Pete or Dr Seuss book instead."
5,Humorous and Clever,Frannie and Pickles is a humorous and clever didactic story that leaves you chuckling and contemplative over those with whom we keep company. Children will love it for its absurdness.
5,May Be The Best Charger Package You Can Buy,"This charger can best be described as a complete package. Has all the features you could possibly want and some not available anywhere else. For you world travelers, it has a built in power supply so no need to lug around an adapter.If there is a better equipped charger on the market at this price, I have yet to see it."
1,"Reliability problems; also, not ""smart"" contrary to claim","I agree with the observations of ""the engineer"" elsewhere in these reviews. I too am an engineer, and I concur with his observations about the limitations of this Maha design.As for my personal experience, the first unit I received died within 5 days. I received VERY cheerful and FAST replacement direct from Maha PowerEx no questions asked. However, the second unit died as well, after just a couple of months of not-so-heavy use.I have given up on this charger. Despite what ""editor's choice"" might say, this charger isn't ""the One"".Truth be told, finding a good charger that is smart, world-power friendly, and inexpensive seems to be nigh unto impossible. Someone let me know if they find one."
3,Hard to tell??,"Bought this charger based on ratings and comments on how well it charges NiMH to capacity and its conditioning cycle. It charges fine but I honestly haven't seen much difference in the flash recharge time on my camera (which is why I bought it in the first place). The one negative comment I have is that it only charges batteries in pairs... So when the battery on my MP3 player runs out, I need to waste a charge cycle on another battery to get the MP3 battery charged."
5,Best Travel Charger on the Market,"After having both an Energizer and SONY charger fail on me over the past year, I finally decided to do a little research and go with the very best. I ended up with the Maha C204W (got mine from Thomas Distributing since they threw in some extra goodies and better batteries for cheaper price). This is a fantastic charger worth the extra money (of course you will spend that money on cheaper models destined to fail within 1-2 years). If you travel, this is the model you should get since it handles different worldwide power outputs automatically and there is no huge ugly heavy transformer to deal with. Others have commented on the great charging features which I will also confirm as being extremely important. The company describes this charger as a ""1 HR Conditioning Travel Charger"". Trust me, you are getting much more than your standard bargain brand battery charger here."
2,Not impressed,"I didn't feel that these batteries and the charger are much of an improvement for my purpose of using it with my Canon camera. This might be a problem of the camera design, but these batteries did not deliver what the online reviews promised."
1,Terrible,"Batteries that came with the package,Powerex, lasted only 6 months with very moderate usage. At this point I get MAYBE 15 flashes at 1/2 power on my 580 EX.The charger is large and awkward. I prefer chargers that have the folding electric prongs rather than the long wire. I also have difficulty seeing if the diode is green or red, charging or charged."
3,camera ready,"My camera eats batteries, but I resisted investing in a battery charger. I am not a techie so have no idea why all of this is as expensive as it is - nor do I know a good charger from a bad one. However, I do know that batteries are not good for the environment and hope to see this technology replaced someday. On the positive side, I am going through far fewer batteries now and hope to make up the cost of my investment; the charger performs as promised."
3,The quality disappointed me.,"Plus;1. The serrated blade is excellent and extremely sharp. I do like that it locks in place.2. The knife does look good and the material seems solid.Minus:1. The reason I ranked it low is that the spring that reopens the pliers moved sideways from the 1st use and now every time I use it, I need to twist it back in position. By experience from previous swiss knives I know that this thing can break if I force it back in place.2. Using the Phillips screwdriver to screw back a cabinet door that fell off on the boat, I noticed that this thing closes very easily and it did cut my finger.. So usable really only for gentle tasks."
3,Good - only two issues,"The color and tool options are great! The knife is extremely heavy and long, and there is a cheap plastic lever on the back that releases the actual knife..."
5,"Love It, but too expensive","I Absolutely Died over this item!!! But it is too darn expensive, for only 1 single sheet!!! Still, I had to have it, and I LOVE it!!!"
1,horrible item,This product would not be suitable for adults and hardly usable for children. The band is too small to pull hair through. Buy something else.Kudos to Peninsula Beauty though. Their customer service person was an absolute pleasure to talk to and they gave me a refund promptly
1,Doesn't work on a MAC at all. Works intermittently on a PC,"I spent three hours with HP technical support trying to make this thing work. The things they had me try were basic, like removing and then reinstalling cables, cycling power, and like. Gee why didn't I think of that?They blamed everything else but the scanner. When I refused to reinstall the hardware yet again, HPs solution was to request I buy a more expensive HP product.I remember when HP produced quality products. Not anymore!"
1,HP scanjet 8300,"We purchased this scanner for the purpose of scanning our slides and negatives. When we tried to scan, we kept getting an error message that stated the TMA adapter was not installed. I tried to solve the issue by using the online chat with HP. They stated that the product was over a year old and out of warranty and would not provide tech support unless we wanted to pay extra. We felt that it was unreasonable for HP to start the warranty from the time it was manufacured instead of the date we purchased it. If this had sold for under a $100, I could understand HP's reluctance in providing Tech support, but we payed a substantial amount of money for this. A few years ago HP was the BEST, but something has happend to the company. Not only do I not recomend buying this scanner but I do not recomend ever purchasing another HP product until their product quality and customer support improves."
4,Works fine with Macs using VueScan,"I was surprised seeing the reviews for this scanner on Amazon. I bought this scanner from a big box electronics store for a higher price than Amazon and am very happy with it. It absolutely works with Macs (at least OS 10.5). Using VueScan, I had it out of the box and scanning within a few minutes. Didn't bother using the HP software. I needed to scan some large photos at a professional level and my Mustek large format scanner just wasn't up to the job. This scanner seems to be a good intermediate scanner between the typical consumer scanners and the very expensive professional ones, Only drawback is it takes up a lot of desk space, but the trade off is you can get far better scans than you can with lesser quality scanners."
3,The Windows 7 driver sucks!,"HP just recently came out with driver version 13.0 for Windows 7 and it is lacking. There is only one descreen feature in the driver thus it will not let you descreen at 145 lpi for artwork or old postcards, etc. Fortunately, I have other systems still running XP (and will continue to run XP) so I can still scan with my UMAX scanner and get good results. All in all, if you are using Windows 7 do NOT purchase a Scanjet 8300 until (read ""IF"") HP comes out with an improved driver."
2,Steer clear of this scanner!,"This device's software is in serious need of rewritting. Attempting to facilitate its use, HP has only developed programming which is awkward, confusing and unstable. My advice to the manufacturer: send it back to square one. To prospective buyers: look elsewhere for a scanner."
4,pep,first I have heard of this band. Didn't know what to expect. Pleasently surprised. Sounds in parts similar to The Mescal Brothers. Doo Wap sounds are cool as well. Musically and vocally great. Good originals as well.
5,An excellent quick-reference work,"If you don't know the difference between ""masculy"" and ""lozengy,"" or if you can't envision a ""gilly-flower,"" this is the book for you. Besides the 600+ pages of alpha-betical, often illustrated listings, Parker includes a complete synoptical table of principal terms, logically and systematically arranged. It's also easy to become absorbed in longer articles on heraldic oddities like the ""Collar of SS"" and the putative arms of Prester John."
3,Old style writing,"This book took a little bit to get into simply because of the type of writing. It was written in the early 1900's so the views and custom's are a bit archaic. But once I adjusted to the style it was an enjoyable read. I was able to get into the characters the more I read and truly enjoyed it. Quite a change of pace, but I recommend it for light reading."
3,The Whole Family,"It was interesting that so many different authors could write in the same style.Humorous to see the situation from each point of view.I thought it would be a novel with each author building on the what the other had written, when really it was one situation told by each character."
5,Breathe easy,"Absolutely a great product. Olbas is the answer to sinus problems, congestion and many other breathing problems. And is much safer than pharmecutical drugs!! Great price and fast shipping. Would definitely recommend this seller."
5,Tough but fun and effective,"I llike this tape. The aerobics is step aerobics, using light weights. The waltz type step work is great for the buns. It can be a bit confusing to do the steps while holding weights, but after doing the tape a few times, you will get the hang of it. It has a feature where you can rewind and do the aerobics twice, making the total aerobic time of 22 minutes. If you are short on time, don't rewind and you will get about 11 minutes of aerobics. If you do the ""double aerobics"" you will end up doing 4 sets of leg press on each leg. The floor work is great and really targets the lower body. The ab work is a killer.I like the instructor, she is encouraging but calm (unlike Janet Jones-Gretsky who is absolutely annoying with all that exhaling). Plus, LaReine is not a boney rail like the other instructors.I do wish this tape had more upper body work. Upper body consists of 2 sets of pushups, each set is 8 reps. One set of french press (16 reps) and one set of work for the back."
4,Great workout!,"I've been buying a number of The Firm tapes, and this is one of my favorites. After warmup and stretching, there's a 10 minute cardio section involving a step. You are cued when to rewind if you want a longer cardio section. The hips and things sculpting involved weights and different positioning, and is great. I wished the ab workout was a little more varied in the type of exercise involved, and it didn't involve any weights.This is a great tape for days when you want to focus on sculpting specific areas."
1,I dont hate it but it wasn't for me,"It's not what I was hoping for. It requires a step bench, and the moves didn't really feel like they were working any muscle. Maybe good for cardio! But I felt silly with each move!"
2,Not as good as it seems!!,"I lost interest in this video after doing it only twice. It is very hard on the back and I didn't feel as if I were getting the ""Total Body Workout"" as promised in the ads. I believe that the Firm videos are just going downwhill since the Susan Harris total body workout video, that has been the best one to date and all others have failed to measure up. Bring back Susan, and hopefully the quality will go up!!!!!!!!"
2,Not one of my favorite,"I have several Firm tapes and this is not one of my favorites. The leg workout in the beginning is good, but I do not like the floor leg work with ankle weights. I do not think it is effective, and actually hurts if you have lower back problems. Don't bother to get this tape, there are plenty of others to sculpt your lower body!!"
2,Too much rolling on the back.,I found the excercises a bit too repetitive and in the end rather painful in the back. Workout time for legs is rather short. Overall workout time is only 35 minutes since a lot of time is lost for commercials.
4,"A great study guide, some math errors, not enough problems","Physics: the easy way is a really good supplement to your studies, especially if you're going for an AP test. However, there are quite a few mathematical errors, and not nearly enough practice problems. The book is very well complemented by ""The Physics Problem Solver"", by REA."
5,A Great Book,"I am taking college physics and it has been quite overwhelming. I have looked at several Physic's books to get an understanding. I turned to amazon.com to see more choices and ordered this book. I am so happy. I love this book and can hardly put it down. Things are making sense now. I just wish I had this book before I started the semester. Thank you Mr. Lehrman. If I could hug you, I would!"
3,Interesting but....,"Reading Broner's recent obit sent me looking to purchase this novel. Its excellent for an intense feeling of eretz Isroel early '50s into '60s, but the allegorical writing felt dated and annoying after a few chapters. Book arrived quickly in clean condition."
3,Ok Information,This one was not quite what I was expecting. It did not have good basic words as a starter guide.
2,Why move on,"Wendell Berry, an otherwise excellent author, has chosen this venue to rail against progress. He seems to want to lock in the 20th, or maybe even the 19th century and stay there.w"
2,Needs a lot of work overall.,"This book is promising but ultimately falls short. First, the order of the book is rather strange, placing matrices in the middle of the book as if to divide the calculus and complex analysis in two. Once you get over the way the book is sorted, the book improves slightly.But then you start looking at all the typos and textual errors in the book and it is clear that the book is in dire need of a second edition. Typos are all over the place, from mislabelling figures to labels that make no sense. Division lines are often missing and reading the answer key is like flipping a coin to see whether the answer provided is reliable.The way the book is worded is often confusing, and the writing is something that Arfkin and Weber certainly excel far better in than McQuarrie.Over all, I would bet that a second edition makeover of the book would do wonders, but I wonder why this book is necessary when better books such as Arfkin and Weber are out there in the first place."
4,physics guy,"I loved this book. It's got all the necessary topics, and occaisionally if you look in the right place a neat trick. I majored in math and took two math methods classes all of which used different books and I think this is your one stop shop for it all. My only complaint is that the material is basic. best probably for undergrads majoring in math/phys/chem/engin"
3,Consolidation not Improvement,"I looked at the table of contents for this book and determined that I already have every chapter in this book in my math books, and ones that can be found for less total than this book (using Dover). If you can handle looking in more than one book, you can get this entire book from one of each of the following: introductory analysis (Taylor & Mann, among others), any diffeq text and your choice of Dover books on complex analysis. There is no point to owning this book."
2,Faith or Skepticism?,Take the good with the bad with this book. Always be skeptical of everything. It would be stupid to treat Christianity with skepticism but then freely accept all that this book has to offer.
3,Leaves a thick greasy residue BUT,"it's interesting. It's dense, turgid, and overly long but all in all the divine Acharya makes her point: Jesus is not her personal Lord and Savior."
2,I'm disappointed after all the other reviews,"After hearing Archarya S on The Infidel Guy, I thought that this would be far more original, objective, and scientific. When I finally reached the chapter on the influence of astrology did I suddenly realize the author's intent in writing this book. Up until then my only criticism would have been her excessive reliance on and lengthy quotations from secondary sources. But after reading the chapter on astrology, I skipped to the last two chapters and read her premise of an ancient widespread civilization, and her conclusions on entering the ""Age of Aquarius"". Then, as an athiest/agnostic, I felt cheated. Maybe I'm simple, but in none of the earlier book reviews nor in the interview on The Infidel Guy did I ever see anyone mention her claim of astrology being a valid science or of her other ""New Age"" notions. Had I known this, I would not have wasted my money or time."
1,sold,"This book and this author prove that fanaticism exists on both sides of the issue. In the book we are told what to believe, or rather, what we will believe if we are truly independent thinkers. To be honest, the book reads like a fundamentalist propaganda piece.....and it's for sale. How ironic."
2,Horrible,"I debated between 1 and 2 stars, I gave her the benefit of doubt. I don't want to spend a lot of time on this review but I can't understand how people would rate this 5 stars? This book has lots of footnotes but they are mostly from Wheless, Massey and a couple of others not mainstream. Some of the stuff is just ridiculous. I could write a internet blog that Marcion was a known homosexual and then she could write the same in her book and footnote to my blog (in fact, she has several references to internet sites). Before you think I am one of these nuts like ""Jeri Nevermind"" my position is Jesus did exist but we know very little about him. If you want a good case for the mythicist position try the Jesus Puzzle."
3,Good book but missing a key element,"This was obviously a well researched book but the author is trying to use that fact that the Catholic and Orthodox bibles, traditions and beliefs are a composite of pagan religions to justify that Jesus never lived. Flavius Josephus verifies the existence of many of the ""made up"" characters of the so-called NT. This book proves that Catholism\Orthodoxy are lies, but not that the Messiah never lived."
5,A Book For Humanity...,"Anyone who says that you are intrinsically worthless and are going to hell, just because you don't happen to share their religious beliefs, are ""In my humble opinion"" Dead Wrong!!!I would heartily recomend this book to anyone who is at all interested in equality and human rights..."
2,Misses its potential,"A confused mishmash of astrology and bad archaeology. I was quite disappointed, hoping to see a cogent debunking of the Christ myth. I'll have to keep looking! There is a better debunking in just a few pages in the Disinformation series than these droll tome.This issue is ripe for exploration, and not in the Gnostic/Da Vinci Code venue. Acharya goes down the bizarre road of India, China, etc. and what for I could never figure out.If you really want to explore Christ as myth, then read this for some small background, since it's a classic in it's field, which is tragic, but you'll still want to keep exploring!"
3,Jesus the Christ?,"Perhaps saying the poor chap never was is going a bit too far, but that the whole image he is regarded in today is shatterd well by the auther, makes up for factual errors.Yes, the whole story is in pagenism, but bhuda and Hindu are way off, other books demonstrate lucidly, the fifiment of imagenation the chap has become enveloped in today.Many Christions including many high up ones who have come to the full realisation of the farce the doctrine of the 'New tetimant' make the mistake of offloading the 'Old Testimant'm this is teerrible and i advise further reading.Everyone today is inferring all sorts of books to everyone else, so perhaps no one will listen wo my book recmendation, but then perhaps just a few will, and for them, this review is worth me writing. ..."
2,Not a very thorough conspiracy...,"(...)You would think that if the Romans were going to create a new unifying state religion, they would also create overwhelming historical, and governmental documentation testifying to the existence of their new god incarnate. This apparently is the same documentation that the author can't find. Seems like a pretty shabby conspiracy to me. If you can create a book that convinces billions of people to believe a religion, that according to the author isn't based on any fact, I would think that you could forge some historical documents?"
1,What a piece of junk...,"The author floods you with the facts, many of which are somewhat doubtful if you look at them more attentively. Say, page 225, quote: ""at Easter orthodox Christians still slaughter lambs, in holding with the ancient Pagan rituals."" Huh? What did she smoke before writing this junk? And such stuff fills the pages densely one after another -- which makes sense, because if you would have time to think, it would not hold. I distinctively felt a need to wash my hand after reading this book."
2,"rated low for writing style, not subject matter","The author has done the research and the facts are truly fascinating and believable, but I just couldn't get past her obvious contempt of Christianity. It comes across as unprofessional and somewhat juvenile. There is nothing wrong with expressing your opinion in your work, but please, just let the facts speak for themselves! There are so many other, better written books on this subject out there that are so much easier to read."
1,For total lunatics,"Many great historians have studied Roman history and church history, and they would all laugh at this book which only a mental retard would believe.Do you believe that men from Mars actually created life on Earth? Then you will probably believe in the worthless contents of this book."
2,scholarly work from unscholarly sources,"For me as a former chirstian this book makes me worry about were did the author get her information from. A bunch of the information that the author gives is proven to be wrong and she is basically just someone who is anti-christian. In the first couple of pages she states her personally opinion. I really don't think the author knows much about the Chirstian Bible since she states some facts that are wrong. Like when she said the Son of God is really the Sun of God, and she realted Jesus story with Horus and many others. Those facts are false it came from an 18th century German writer. I personally like facts and make up my own mind from the facts. This book is unscholarly work plain and simple."
1,Look in the Primary Text; Half Her Claims Are Bogus,"As shocking as this sounds, half of the parallels that Acharya S lists literally do not exist when we examine the primary texts. Of those that remain, they all appear in post-New Testament manuscripts (i.e. the Avesta, which wasn't written until the 4th century A.D.) I don't mind books that are critical of the Christian world-view, but this book is outrageously dishonest and consists of very poor scholarship. If Jesus was alive today, he could sue for libel. Please consult www.tektonics.org/copycast for more information."
2,Angry and Hysterical,"I tried to read this book. I failed. It was so angry and hysterical in tone-- the author obviously despises Christianity and carries a huge grudge against every bad thing ever attributed to the religion. I DO believe there is a LOT of good evidence behind the ""Jesus never existed"" idea, but I wouldn't believe any of it coming from someone so obviously biased."
2,Not an easy read,"This book is very ""texty."" I figured it would contain facts and figures and would be informational, but it actually contains very little of that. The author spends more time citing other authors and publications. She seems to sway the reader to a conclusion rather than offer meaty food for thought. I was hoping to get a different persepctive, but after reading this book, I've decided that it doesn't matter whether Jesus was real. It's still a great story and he still gives us good example of how to live in relationship to one another. Peace out ~m"
4,"Not for everyone, but...","This book is quite well written. One thing people should know before buying it is that it is from an atheist perspective...so for example if you are a Jew looking for a book that reveals false Christianity, know that the author also tries to break apart the Hebrew Bible as well."
1,Christ Conspiracy / conspiracy...,I believe books like this are great deceptions to turn people away from the truth. This book is neither accurate or honest in its scholarship. I would suggest that you read the rebuttal of this book written by one who knows the facts...
1,Godly ignorance,"This author claims that Jesus Christ is nothing but a myth; a personality formed by the meshing together of other pagan gods. Therefore, she has no idea who God is and no idea of Jesus Christ's love for not only her, but the whole world. Don't believe the Bible? The only way to disprove the Bible is to believe in what it says and for none of its promises to come to pass. Try that, then write a book on how the Bible isn't true."
5,SUPER!,"This book blew my mind and removed the religious cobwebs that made me blind.It covers A to Z in perhaps the greatest conspiracy on the planet.I'm hearing that Acharya's new book, ""Suns of God,"" is awesome too."
1,Typical Christ Propaganda !!!!!,"Acharya S is a typical Propagandanist. To infer that the Jesus Mythos is similar to the Buddha Mythos is like saying Ford Motors is quite similar to General Motors. Nevermind the fact that both Ford and General are manufactured by two different companies with two different manufacturing techniques. It's quite asinine only to focus on the simililarities between Jesus and Buddha just because both are 'Savior Gods', but it's equally absurd to suggest that either of the two Mythological characters are the product of a conspiracy without 6 billion humans ever noticing the plot. Thus,Acharya S seems desperate to form her own viewpoints to unsubstantiated similarities between Jesus and Buddha to support her own religious hindu bias beliefs. (Note: Acharya S is recorded in one of her earlier books [I dont remember the specific title] that Christianity is a product of Hindu beliefs.)"
4,good read but a little scandalist,"Very good read, valuable information, but a lot of quotes from other scholars, most from back in the day. A lot of the information she passed on to us was a little presumptuous. There is a Mithraic scripture mentioned without giving the name (I cant find ANY Mithraic scriptures anywhere and I heared they used pictures)"
1,Not worth buying,"The author doesnt know jack about what she is writing. Saying something wild does not make it true, no matter how much you want to believe it - you must give some basis for saying something. I know for a fact that all the stuff she wrote about Krishna is unsubstantiated - there are no references from any Indian source to substantiate what she writes about Krishna. It seems quite cooked up and even though its a conspiracy book - it is really lame in research quality - at least definitely on the indian sources front. That makes me suspect her other writing, too - that it may be full of improper research (BS, in other words).There are many books on similar subjects in the market with at least some authenticity. But this book seems a totally cooked up thing.Well, this author is definitely off my list henceforth."
3,The Christ Conspiracy,The book is very stimulating and very convincing for the most part...however it is a far too academic presentation...I am no longer in grad school and am happy to read mundane prose. I gave sections of the book to friends to examine and several balked at the language;too many terms they did not know--of the four people to read [parts] so far I am the only one that will complete reading the entire text. Hard to carry the message when you don't know what the words are...For me the book is fine;I was a believer before I read word one. My niece w/ a Masters degree was finished after 4 pages!
2,Fair but flawed,A fair book with many interesting ideas but takes too many leaps of faith/logic? in coming to concusions based on data. Not always logically sound and a number of personal interpretations of events that logically could be interpreted differently. Worth reading just to shake up some beliefs.
4,Mythology revisited,I found this book to be entertaining as well as informative.There are sections where the quotations run too fast and furiousOverall it is a good read without the usual animosity that is generated when new agers speak about organized ? religion.
5,A Must Read!,"They should teach this in the grade schools as early as possible before the children are brainwashed in the sunday schools of the organized religions! Bravo for speaking out on the subject. I am a professional astrologer and know how true this information rings. For those that shrug off the astrology part, it is possibly because they don't have a clue about astrology so they don't understand how much of their regular daily lives have already been built upon it without them even being aware. Astrology isn't what is printed in the columns of papers, it takes years to study. The author's truths are easily verified and not based on conjecture."
2,Regurgitated version of other books,"This book and its theme is nothing newThe World's Sixteen Crucified Saviorsis a much better version of a study the themes taken from other religions into Christianity. Further reading would beThe Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion (Abridged Edition from Ancient Wisdom Publication). Kipling's saying would be appropriate for this book.""there is nothing new under the sun""."
3,"Whether true or not, written just a little too biased.","What this book has going for it are the fact that it's easy to read, draws a lot on other sources (Which could be a downfall)which are referenced, and the fact that it's mostly true. The biggest problem I had with it was how vehemently ant-christian it was. I like to read from authors who are objective in their research, and not trying so hard to credit or discredit their subject. I think a lot of the insignificant and unprovable points made actually weakened the overall blow of the whole of it. Though it was a stiffer read, I got a lot more out of Michael Martin's ""The Case Against Christianity"". He stuck more to the facts and remained more of a non-biased observer. Most of the information is acuurate in Achyra's book, but I got a little sick of the ""... and as the big, mean Christians viciously slaughtered the poor, pretty, doe-eyed little Pagans..."" element of the book. After all, all religions have done horrible things to somebody."
2,Some Good but Unoriginal Ideas but also Negatively Overwhelming,"I liked some of her presentations; however, digressing to astrology in the bible and an ancient global civilization is to me is not relevant to the conspiracy by the christian church of the first centuries CE for the subjugation of the ignorant European masses.Acharya inundates her paragraphs with many quotes from many different sources, which can be overwhelming to read and understand. I would prefer to read some the books she quotes (at least she has a bibliography in the back as a resource) and draw my own conclusions, many of which will probably agree with hers.But at least I wouldn't be overwhelmed by bits and pieces I consider uninteresting and uninspiring, such as astrology (as one form of mythology) and a global civilization for which there is no record. I consider the lost continent of Atlantis about as factual as the historicity of Jesus as the christ or as factual as the practice of astrology."
3,From interesting to X-Files. Worth reading.,"There is much interesting information in this book and is definite worth reading with a eye toward researching other opinions. Definitely not a book to be read in a vacuum. If you follow up some of the footnotes, you will notice that many are from authors whose works reflect a similar bent to this authors and are not as authoritative as one might like. In the latter portions of the book, the author seems to go rather ""X-Files"" citing possibilities of early high civilizations of Pygmies and a multi-millennium history for the Masons. This would be the antithesis for the writings of Pope Benedict who indicates that we should simply believe the gospels as written, there being no value to proving the historicity of Jesus. Both make significant extrapolations on the evidence that is not necessarily appropriate or credible."
3,The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Told,This book is a collective summary of many book resources correlating the many ageless myths of civilization with Christian Bible information. There is much published information disclosing that Biblical stories correlate with myths older than when the Bible could have been written and this book has collected the many authors and books in one efficient manner.
1,RECYCLED EARLIER MATERIAL,"THIS BOOK IS NOT A NEW ""REVELATION"" AS MOST OF THE REVIEWERS THINK. MOST OF THE CLAIMS COME FROM EARLIER SOURCES. I RECOMMEND ""JESUS PUZZLE"" BY EARL DOHERTY INSTEAD OR ""DECONSTRUCTING JESUS"" BY ROBERT PRICE. INTERESTINGLY, ROBERT PRICE, AN AGNOSTIC HIMSELF, HAS CRITICIZED THIS BOOK FOR ITS POOR SCHOLARSHIP, THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING, DARE TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER YOURSELF."
1,Truth Seekers Beware!,"I have been reading books on this topic for years and am fully convinced that Jesus Christ is a mythical character for a number of reasons. However, if you're pursuing this subject, I strongly recommend you don't waste your time on this ridiculous book. It's filled with irrelevant information, quotes from New Age gurus and feminist icons, and the author apparently expects us to believe that Jesus Christ is mythical for no better reason than the fact that Margaret Sanger (the founder of the infanticide group Planned Parenthood, who was also an admirer of Adolf Hitler!) found Christianity ""oppressive.""Fortunately, there have been a number of scholarly books expounding upon the mythicist position that are both well research and well written. This book is neither. Please save your money for more worthwhile endeavors."
1,"general principles, yes...other then that DEMONSTRATION ONLY","It started out good with some thoughts about Aikido in general, but then it showed the names of the techniques (which are japanesse, with no reasonable translation) and then they showed the techniques with no explanation as to what was going on. At first I thought the sound had been killed, but I could still hear the thuds of the people hitting the ground, and the drum sound when they showed the technique name. I normally do not write reviews, but I was very dissappointed with this video."
4,Good Resource,Great Resource for finding out about this subject matter. I found it very helpful. Loaded with Good Info anyone can use.
2,Thumbs down,"This book is incredibly hard to understand and very boring. It might just be me, but it took me a little too long to decipher one paragraph in the book."
5,Great African Diaspora DVD-Cuban,I love this movie. It is on the same level as Quilombo in showing the resistance and self sufficiency of Africans who were forcibly brought to the Western Hemisphere by slave traders. It is refreshing to see the Afro-Cubans history highlighted from a historical viewpoint that shows how they fought to maintain their own freedom.
5,Flexibility describes this.,I like how I can make this long or short! I use it to secure my bike to my bike rack on my truck. It is also just the right thickness.Highly recommend.
4,Nice,"I ordered two of these for trail cameras. They both seem to work pretty well. I was worried they all were keyed alike, but mine took different keys. They are like most locks they help keep a honest man honest."
5,I highly recommended this book!,"Except Anton Chekhov, I have never read any book so subtlely investigating the human nature from the well-tailored short stories. The best one among them is ""The Third Son"", which was highly praised by Hemingway, exposed a highly dramatic scene and shaken my heart in its lowest and humblest sound. Platonov is among the best short stories writers almost as great as Chekhov. This is my bias that he was even better than James Joyce and Guy Maupassant because he never use too cynical, satirical or poignant attitude to his subject (even to the ugliest side of the human nature). He accept the ""most"" good and the ""most"" bad one too. Unlike Chekhov, he showed us the straightness and rustlessness of the Russians, his nation-people and the influence of Soviet Union on Russian culture. So he could deal with the essential problem of human beings in his era, under its own cultural atmosphere."
3,Uneven Collection,"If I could give stars by the stories, I'd definitely give five to some (Homecoming, Potudan River and The Fierce and Beautiful World) and less or much less (Dzhan) to others. However, even in the lesser stories, Platonov's writing is able to shine through, be it in a description a simile/metaphor or simply in a turn of the phrase. The translation seems to capture this in English, though a better introduction of the content of each story might have been useful. Worth buying, especially if you have a taste for Russian literature."
4,MORE HISTORY,"If you really want to know how it all happened, you have to read this book. But don't just read it, try to place yourself there and at the time. And you will understand it."
3,Polish 101,The video is good. It has what I expected but I have to play around with my remote to go from one step to another.
1,Not For Me,"Sorry. This is OK as a textook for students of Civil War battles, but wouldn't interest most people. Not for me."
1,A baffling contraption,"At least for the rear seat of my Accord coupe, this seat cover was completely inadequate. It comes in two pieces, each of which looks a lot like an elasticized bucket seat cover, and neither of which stayed in place on the seat. Furthermore, there is no accommodation for rear head rests. I have a hard time imagining how this cover could work on any rear car seat."
3,back seat cover,"I ordered this for my son's car - a 1988 Volvo sedan and no matter how we've stretched & pulled we can't make the back fit! We've taken the seat out of the car & everything. I thought I was getting a great deal, and what I've gotten was a lemon - make that 1/2 a lemon! The bottom does fit. I think I would've done better to spend more money and ordered a custom cover!"
4,Works,This product was effective in helping our 14 year black lab. There was a marked difference in his movements. He is much stronger and agile
4,Glucosamine,Our Spring had surgery on her knee. The Vet suggested we use Glucosamine. She did very well on this and we will continue to use it for awhile.
3,Seems to work over time and he does eat them,"I am on my third bottle and third month and it does seem to be helping. My 12-year-old dog (70 lb brindle mutt) has been having sore legs or hips, especially going up and down stairs and in and out of the car. The vet recommended these during his last check-up.The bottle prescribes three pills daily for a dog this size, so a bottle will last about a month. In about a week he did seem somewhat better - since then, he seems about the same. On days that he is active (he goes out to the park with a play group of younger dogs) I will sometimes give him a double dose as I am sure he has overdone it.He does like the taste, which is good as it would be a pain to try and pulverize them into his food.I recommend these, but expect modest improvement within a week, not necessarily drastic results. I haven't tried other brands yet so cannot compare.-karen takatani"
3,Crumbs,"I don't see any difference in my dog, but I'm sure it may be effective for others. My issue is that the product gets broken in small pieces and dust during shipping thus ruining the convenience of a chewable tablet."
2,My Dog didn't like the taste,"wish I could have tried the product. Bought a entire bottle and was able to get my dog to eat only one. She refused to eat anymore. If your dog is picky with treats, may not be the best for you. Will need to try some type in pill form."
5,Works extremely well,"My 7 year old German Shepherd/Chesapeake Bay Retriever cross is, without these pills, a very slow-moving and pained dog. She has trouble standing up, getting onto the couch, and sometimes even walking; however, she has been on these pills for only a month now, and I have seen a HUGE improvement. She runs for short distances and doesn't seem to be nearly as stiff anymore. I will definitely be continuing to purchase these in the future."
2,not for small dogs,"my dogs are small (9 lbs each) so i have to cut each tablet in half which is inconvenient. i was also told by my vet that i could buy generic glucosamine chondroitin and it's much cheaper. the dogs liked the flavor, but then again they've been known to eat cat poop so..."
2,No good if dog won't eat it.,I had hoped this product would help my bichon but she refuses to eat them.. I am going to try another product and hope that it will be better.
4,Dog loves 'em; not sure of benefit yet,"Our dog is a 10 yr old miniature schnauzer. She sometimes limps after jumping off the couch, so the Vet recommended a glucosamine supplement. She loves the flavor but I know that it takes time to see results; she has taken for about 2 months. She seems to be limping less but at least she is not getting worse."
5,Why isn't this gal a star????,"I've been a Kelly Willis fan for several years. But this is Kelly's best. (And the cover design is excellent.) This CD is more proof why Austin is becoming a country music capital. If I end up stranded on a desert isle with one CD this year, I want it to be this one."
3,"Good Album, wrong category.","This album has been called one of the best alternative country efforts of 1999, but I'm afraid I can't go along with that one. To me, this album does little to distinguish itself from other female singers on Top 40 country. While the album is good by mainstream country standards, it just doesn't cut it for me as an Alt. Country record. The songs are not bad, but they are hardly distinctive enough to be called Alt. Country."
2,Too country; very average,"Bought this because it was compared to Lucinda Williams. It's not. Unlike Williams, Kelly Willis is pure country - the warbly voice, pedal steel, etc. I hate it ! On top of that her song writing is no where near the class of Williams. There's not one song that draws you in. Summary: very disappointing"
3,A bit sedate...,"No one can dispute her singing voice, which is supple and expressive. The pace of this album tends to drift into sameness. I listen to this album a lot, but given the list of players and songwriters involved, maybe I set my expectations too high.For a brassier, more dynamic collection of this kind, I strongly recommend the new album by Neko Case and Her Boyfriends called ""Furnace Room Lullaby"". This one has me hooked!"
1,Very disappointing,"This album is professionally recorded, and Willis has a potentially interesting voice, but the arrangements are staggeringly unimaginative. Every song (every song!) plods along at an ennui-inducing mid-tempo. Willis's original material is not especially imaginative (and that description greatly overvalues the grating title tune), but what really nails this album's failures are her covers. Among these, she has recorded songs written by Nick Drake and Replacements-era Paul Westerberg. At that point in his career, Westerberg was writing hooks to die for, yet Willis's rendering of ""They're Blind"" is utterly indistinguishable from everything else on the album. And when everything else is as undistinguished and bland and passionless as it is here, it's time to look for a new producer."
3,Kelly Willis doesn't have much vocal range.,"I purchased this CD based on the reviews that I read online. I am disappointed. While I like many of the lyrics, most of the songs blend together and have completely forgettable melodies - suited to Kelly Willis' rather narrow vocal range. The only song that I really liked (not enthusiastically) was ""Fading Fast"". She reminds me somewhat of Natalie Merchant, there is a sameness in the way she sings every song."
5,well worth the wait,"This has to be one of the top CDs of the year. Kelly's voice is magnificent, and the songs here are top-notch. ""Wrapped,"" ""Heaven Bound,"" and ""Take me Down"" will blow you away. Just get it."
4,Alternative Country,"I have always heard about Kelly Willis but never actually heard her. I found the tape for 8 bucks and the first time I listened to it, I didn't care too much for her voice. But thank goodness I gave it another try. It reminds me a lot of ""Tomorrow the Green Grass"" by the Jayhawks. This is such a good tape to just put in on a long drive. I love how she just starts singing on ""Take Me Down"" like you were in a middle of a conversation. Her music deserves to played on any radio format, especially country. This is way better that Garth Gaines. If you're looking for a good folky, country CD this is the one."
4,Well worth the price,"My tastes in Country music are rather mainstream. I love the Shania Twains, Martina McBrides, etc., and I'm not afraid to admit it (anonymously anyway). So I thought it important to let readers know that this album is totally accessible and enjoyable. I liked about 9 out of the 13 songs, and the other 4 make me want to jump off a bridge, so I just skip over them. The artist is very attractive and talented and apparently sad for some reason. The mesmerizing title song has become one of my all-time favorites. This album is well worth the price."
4,A fine album!,"I have enjoyed Kelly's music since seeing videos of her last self-titled album. Since then she has become one of my favorite singers. My initial feelings echoed somewhat similiar( maybe 2/3*'s) to the guys from Hong Kong, but after a second and third listen, things began to look up. Perhaps I was expecting more of the energetic, hook filled tunes from the past. This one is more country and has a quiet, slow, ""sunny day"" feel to it. There is nothing wrong with the arrangements or song selection, they all fit and accent Kelly's voice quite well. A definite 4* rating."
2,Too Depressing,"I am a big Kelly Willis fan. But this CD leaves much to be desired. Mostly all of these songs are slow-tempo and depressing. Even KW herself admitted on a radio program that this CD was therapy for her.If you really want a cool KW cd, try finding that four song CD compilation she recorded with Jay Farrar and the Son Volt crew. It has all the great alt. country instruments, combined with her beautiful voice. It is her best . . . and hard to find . . ."
2,What am I missing?,"I am a music lover with eclectic tastes,any type of music that reveals the truth and beauty of life is likely to enchant me,particularly if it involves the human voice and more particularly the female voice.For the life of me I cannot hear any quality in this womans singing! no range,no colour,no light and shade,she intones every song on this album in the same dreary semi-conversational monotone.The songwriting too is weak,each song plodding painfully along in its dull mid-tempo groove.You will search in vain here for any memorable melody or a surprising musical development,predictability and dullness seem to be order of the day.For all the accusations of hype and showbiz slickness I find LeAnn Rimes to be the most interesting voice in modern country,for sure her two albums Blue and LeAnn provide more variey of mood,better singing and simply more listening pleasure than this mediocre effort."
5,This is a great album,"First of all, for a ""country"" artist to cover both Nick Drake and The Replacements deserves kudos alone. What I Deserve is one of my all time favorite albums, one I would be happy to be stranded with on a desert island. Standouts include ""Talk Like That"", ""They're Blind"", ""Not Forgotten You"" & ""Time Has Told Me"".Buy this album, artists like Kelly Willis, unpretentious and not bound commercially, deserve our support."
5,Wonderful,"Kelly Willis is wonderful. I am not sure what everyone else hears, with all this negativity. The songs moved me. Her voice has so much inflection and passion. Not to mention this is most likely the best produced album of the year. It is a very balanced album. I can listen to it for weeks at a time with no interuption. I love it."
2,Not what I deserve.,"I gotta admit, I was very disappointed with this record. I had looked forward to it's release for weeks, hoping it would continue in the tradition of 1996's ""Fading Fast"" EP, unfortunately it doesn't. With it's overproduction and poor song selection, it drifts uncomfortably close to mainstream country radio. Kelly Willis deserves more than this."
5,We're a 'dying' breed,"This book is so encouraging, and amusing, to read 'my own life' in someone else's words/experiences. I guess we full-time Mums (and it sure seems that there's not many of us left) really do have a lot in common! I keep thinking that Dad's should read this too - well, my husband anyway!"
1,Not worth it,"I bought this guide and the game at the same time. I finished the game long before I would need the book. The game was way too easy to complete, making the guide useless."
4,Very enjoyable slack key guitar,"This is wonderful music played by excellent musicians. I would have given it five stars had I not first heard Slack Key Guitar vol. 2, which I think is slight better (certainly a little longer)."
1,Give kids some credit... and content,"I received this as a gift when my son was born and thought the idea was very sweet. Unfortunately, the message seems to be lost. Especially in the Old Testament. I wish I would have previewed this book before reading aloud to my son as I tripped over words and jaw hanging open as two children are pictured in a garden eating the ""no-no fruit"" and the page instructs young ones to wave bye bye to Adam and Eve. Maybe tackling less than a book of the Bible per 4 sentence page would make for a better book. If this is how you plan to first introduce your child to God and the Bible, DO NOT BUY!!! It is humorous with an established understanding of God. But read with a child's open mind it is weird. I think all the 5 star ratings are Christian reviewers who refuse to give a book with the word ""Bible"" in the title less than highest marks. There are better options out there."
5,The sweetest memories are from this book,"I used this book as my daughter's first Bible. She loved the simple interactions it gave us - a very special time. It was her favorite book, and she looked forward to our Bible time together every night. My cousin had the same reaction with her son. He used to carry the book around like a ""blankie."" My cousin sent me a picture of that, as it was so common for him to do. I am glad they are still selling the book, as my daughter is now 14 years old, and still loving the Lord."
2,Sadly not worth the effort,"Lita Grey Chaplin, the screen legend's second, teenaged, bride, published her memoirs of life with Chaplin back in 1966. That supposedly shocking ""exposé"" was apparently mainly the work of a ghost-writer who spiced it up to bolster sales. ""Wife of the Life of the Party,"" on the other hand, is advertized as a much more balanced view of the lady's stormy, if brief, marriage to Chaplin. It may be; I haven't read the 1966 book. But Lita still presents herself as innocence incarnate and Charlie as an unfeeeling cad and a debaucher. The truth, I suspect, lies somewhere in between. The big question, however, remains: Does it matter anymore? Chaplin's work speaks for itself. Obviously, the writing of the book was a cartharsis for an elderly woman, who, sadly, passed away shortly before it was published. My two stars are for Miss Chaplin's interesting account of the making of THE KID and for co-author Jeffrey Vance's copious and informative notes and wrap-around."
2,Thanks to the warning reviewers,"First, my rating should not be considered since I did not read this book. I would just like to take a minute to say something. I don't think I can actually thank the 2 reviewers warning not to buy this book by writing to them personally, so I will say it here. Thank you! I had a feeling this book would be just as you described. I didn't think Lita's motives or personality could ever be truly credible after the way she publicly drug his name through the mud during the divorce. Thank you for solidifying my assumption and saving me a few dollars! Glad others feel the way I do!Very appreciative,Chaplin fan forever"
1,Scary for kids!,"Are you kidding me? Sharks, crabs, eels. This is a children's book. Look at the eels...they look like they're out for blood. Think about your audience prior to drawing these very scary pix!"
2,"""Slash and Thrust"" fails to hit the mark","After reading this author's ""Flexible Weapons"", I had high hopes for this title. It was, however, highly disappointing. Though the overview of weapon styles is satisfactory, and the training tips somewhat helpful, the whole effort ends up being mediocre at best. Illustrations are sparse. There are much more thoughtful, seasoned, and illuminating titles to be found elsewhere."
3,decent but short,Some good info on bladed weapons to be had here but you have to use your imagination because the book is sparsley illustrated with no step by step techniques as found in other knife fighting books.Very short.
3,A GOOD ATTEMPT,"This entry-level text has lots of illustrations and diagrams, but, unfortunately, they are mostly pictures of weapons and depictions of anatomical targets. The information is good, but sparse -- Mister Sanchez could've stood to reduce the text devoted to training and expand the information pertaining to technique. A few of the recommended concealed carry methods are questionable, although it appears that Mister Sanchez is speaking from experience. The depictions of exotic weaponry will titillate the neophyte, as will the chart of ""quick kill"" targets -- but there is nothing here for the experienced knifefighter. An admirable attempt, nonetheless."
4,NIcely constructed but heavy,"This is a very nice looking pot, well constructed, tough teflon surface, easy to clean. I use it on my induction cooktop. However I have 2 complaints. It is heavy so you must use 2 hands to carry a pot of spaghetti to the sink to drain, for example. Also, the lid has an odd construction and doesn't have a inner lip or edge so when you lift off the lid to set it down, water drips all over the place. I would still buy it again but beware if you aren't too strong."
1,Wrong item,"Be careful! I ordered these and got the comfort ""flex"" boxers. Totally different. These are not the boxers pictured above.Very sneaky..."
1,not good,"These boxers were extremely see-through thin; not like what I've purchased elsewhere. Also, not in original packaging, but instead were repackaged, loose, in a clear plastic bag with no cardboard, no tags or labeling attached at all."
3,N,"These were advertised as the new tagless version of these boxers. They are the older ""tagged"" version. Fit is fine and as expected"
2,These feel crunchy and cheap,These feel crunchy and cheap. There is nothing soft or comfortable about these boxers. They are also just plain ugly and came in a different color than was shown.
5,the best,"I have tried so many brands and none are better than these. Don't waste time looking for better prices. For the quality, there is no better price."
2,"Great seller, crappy product","I bought these boxers for my husband's Christmas stocking and am highly disappointed. The material is extremely thin and scratchy, and the elastic band is definitely not ComfortSoft. The package was supposed to be a plaid assortment, but only two were plaid and the third pair was a hideous skull pattern (I like skull patterns, but this material is so ugly). I will have to buy replacements, because there is no way I am going to make my poor husband wear these ugly, uncomfortable boxers."
1,Disappointed,The merchandise that arrived was not what was pictured. We will be returning the items. We are very disappointed!! Huge hassle
1,DESIGN FLAW - bunches up in the back,"You would think that Hanes, the underware experts, would be able to design a compfortable pare of boxer shorts but you would be wrong! I hink Hanes was trying to get fancy and designed the back of these shorts with an insert so there are two seams running on the back side instead of one seam down the middle. Consequently the underware is uncomfortable to move or sit in because you are always rubbing on the seams and it bunches up in the back. DO NOT BUY."
2,Not 100% cotton!,"You get what you pay for in this case. The material is 60% polyester, very thin, flimsy and scratchy. I sent them back."
1,Misrepresented,"This item is not the ""Comfort Soft"" boxers. They are in fact the Comfort Flex waistband boxers and had a picture on the ad as comfort soft with small words by it that said comfort flex -even though the title said comfort soft. Clearly bait and switch, but Amazon chose not to pull them off the site -buy them if you like comfort flex only!"
2,Comfort Soft! Yeah right.,"Item is NOT what was described on the information page for these Hanes boxer shorts. The boxers were a whole different kind of boxers, the kind I was specifically trying to Avoid. Product is not what they say it is. This product I sent back to the seller. If you are looking for the COMFORT SOFT WAISTBAND, don't buy it from this seller. It is not what they say it is. :("
2,too thin,The fabric material for these boxers is extremely thin. Much thinner than any other pair of boxers or briefs I own. They are practically see through.
4,Good buy for the price.,"I bought these boxers assuming they would be decent quality since they were so cheap. I only bought one pack to test them out because you never really know what to expect buying clothing online. When they arrived I immediately put them on and was surprised that the waist band worked so well. I also really liked the colors so I wore them for a few days and decided to buy 2 more packs. There was no picture of the colors of these packs so I decided to take my chances because they were so cheap. When they arrived I realized why there was no picture! The colors are a mixture of blue, yellow, and red-ish? If there is a picture and you like the colors I would say you should buy them because so far the quality is well above what I expected. But if there isn't a picture you might want to stay away from these!"
1,Not What I Expected,"I was expecting ""Comfort Soft"" waistband boxers but I got ""Comfort Flex."" This is not the same thing. Also, the boxers I received are a red plaid (also not featured) where two are the same red plaid and the other looks like red with a snowflake design on it. I was hoping they would be three different designs and/or colors- even if it was a subtle difference."
1,Unhappy,I expected more from hanes but i was disappointed. I bought the T-SHIRT soft material hanes before for my husband and he loved it but this nope!!!
3,There IS a tag. Believe me.,"The tag is rubber, and it peels away, AFTER ONE WASH! The peeled rubber tag leaves an ugly blotch on the waistband. A tag is a tag and this is a TAG. Two stars come off for this lie. I'm throwing away the boxers that I have yet to wear and am now going commando for the rest of my life. Just sick of trying to find a real, honest-to-goodness, TAGLESS pair of boxers or underwear."
3,Picture is misleading,When purchasing this product I made the assumption that it was a set based on the picture. I didn't look at the full title where it stated SINGLE. I bought two thinking I would get 6 and ended up with 2. In my opinion 2 hurdles are not worth 30 bucks. My last negative comment is I wish these hurdles were a little wider.
5,Great product,Awesome! I only got one but I love it so much I need to order some more. Everything came when expected
4,Good for what it is...,"if you like the whole rap-rock, catchy chorus, nu metal vibe (which I admit I do), then give the guys a chance. True, theres nothing groundbreaking on ""Lines in My Face"", but its a refreshing change from the ""Yellowcards"" and ""Von Bondies"" that have sadly taken over mainstream rock..."
3,nothing revolutionary,"i first heard chroni future on the mvp baseball 2004 soundtrack, and ""time and time again"" was a pleasing first single. the rest of the album is a bit of a letdown; the sound is similar to 311, but with heavier guitar and screaming. tracks like world keeps spinning, new york ny, wicked games and eyes wide open are what keep me coming back to this album, but the rest of the album is largely forgettable."
3,Chronic Future? Aren't they...,"Aren't these guys from 2 Skinnee J's? Though I don't own this CD, listen to 2 Skinnee J's and then you decide."
5,Good Music.,"Really Really Good Music, Romantic, Sad, All Great. Catchy. Beautiful music. Worth Listening to. When Music Was Music."
5,Love this CD,I love this CD...I listened to it everytime I drive or when I'm at home. I have many CDs of Julio Iglesias but this is by far my favorite!
5,Tne 24 Greatest Songs,Great CD. Julio continues to be a wonderful sexy singer. Greatly enjoyed. Arrived well within time frame and in great condition.
4,Easy Listening,If you like the romantic singing of Julio Inglesias you will really like this CD. Of course he sings the songs in Spanish and I still enjoy them even though I am not fluent in the language.
3,New White Tea Length Crinoline Slip,I bought this to go under my flower girl's dress. I was a little disappointed with this slip. It was too long and not nearly as poofy as I would have liked. It did add some volumn so I will still use it.
2,size,The sizing on these is not acuarate had to make ajustments when it was received so it was a good thing I knew how to do that
5,Perfect,"My granddaughter needed a White Slip Petticoat to go under the style dress she had. This Petticoat was perfect, good quality, shipped fast, no problems, fair price. The seller helped us as this item was hard to find locally."
5,Great doorbell,I am very happy with this doorbell. I bought this for a business with a big one floor building. We needed a doorbell that could be heard all around. This doorbell has performed perfectly. It can be heard way down at the other end of the building.
5,An intimate look at days gone by,"*They Came to This Place* is a well-researched history of Czech settlers in a small town in Northwest Iowa. As a person of Czech ancestry, the value of this book for me lies in a new awareness of the hardships borne by those rugged souls who made my life in America possible. From Indian hostilities to prohibition, a fascinating slice of bygone days of American life emerges from the pages of this book.Klimesh describes himself as neither historian nor writer and then proceeds to prove himself wrong on both counts."
3,Nice boots,"I think these are nice. Nothing extravagantly fancy, just good boots at a good price. the leather is soft. I bought a size up and I think I could have gone down half a size. Heel is high but not too high, and they walk comfortably."
3,"Too tight, too long.","I would have loved to keep these boots if they had been true-to-size. I ordered them in my usual 7.5 M, but they fit more like an 8 or 8.5 N and so I had to return them."
4,Elegant and stunning...,"Ok, I'm going to have to agree with the majority of the people on here, these boots are absolutely gorgeous. They're comfortable and the heel is just right, not too high. The leather is soft and supple adding to the comfortable feel of the boots. My only advice in purchasing them is to size up a .5"". I got these in my normal size 7 but I had to return them because they were too tight in the toe section. I got them in a 7.5"" and they were a perfect fit. So other than the fact that the boots are not exactly true to size, I would highly recommend them."
4,Great buy,"Just got these and have found them true to size. I had originally ordered up a 1/2 size as per others' recs but that was too big. In fact, there is definitely some extra room in the toe so makes your foot look maybe 1/2"" longer than it is. Leather is very soft, heel is nice height and they are very comfortable. Opening is a bit wide but works for me."
4,My wife loves it.,"They look beautiful. Good quality leather, true to the size and decent price. A good purchase"
1,Not impressed...,I must say I am not very happy with these boots at all. I am surprised considering all the good reviews. The boots are way too big in the heel and very wide around my ankle. When I walk in these the extra material in front pushes inward and pokes my ankle. I could only wear for moments...these will be returned A.S.A.P.
4,Great Boots,"These boots are very nice, they are not too tall and I wear them around the house. No need to kick them off right when you get home. One thing they need are the pads on the bottom, so they are not so slippery."
3,It Tingles,"I have to warn everyone that this product has mineral oil and petrolatum in it. If they could replicate the results without those terrible ingredients, I'd buy it. My temples thickened up after thinning due to a temporary bout of malnutrition."
3,Good product,"I saw no significant changes to scalp or hair then using any other hair product. Scalp treatments are beneficial in general, and you should have a regime that works for your hair texture. This one was not too heavy, and worked just average for me."
4,Top of the line,"This product is great. Fluke is top of the line. These leads have worked out great for me. The only thing I wish, is that one side of the leads were straight. When I ordered them, I knew what I was ordering and I have not been disappointed."
5,Excellent book on the Vestals.,This book is an excellent source for infomation on the Vestal Virgins. It also provides many ancient and modern sources to consult for further information. It is the best complete reference source out there that I have been able to locate about the Vestals.
5,Cannon God Exaxxion is sure to blow you away!,"This is one of the favorites of my collection--I practically memorized it within two days of buying it. It has everything... humor, romance, action, adventure, terror, and most importantly--beautiful women and incredible mecha! And it is (semi) believable. Isaka's...assets are like that for a reason, which makes a weird sort of sense. Hoichi is reluctant at first to play the part of the hero, but once he gets a load of his weaponry, his assistant, and his fans, he's all for it.This should appeal to fans of Gundam and Escaflowne, due to the incredible mech designs and action. Of course, fans of Gunsmith Cats will probably enjoy it too.And for those of you that are not in the above categories--read it anyway! You won't be sorry you did!"
1,Wish it were watchable.,"This movie seems very interesting in concept. Unfortunately, the plot and narration is so annoyingly dumb it draws attention away from the film clips and 'ficto-historical' information. What could have been a cool bit of agitprop becomes something that seems as if it were written by a freshman sociology major. Sadly, I suggest you don't waste your time with this one."
3,Nice...,"This is a pleasant CD, but nothing really moved me. It is up to the standard of Tingstad & Rumbel, but is not outstanding."
3,Whats uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupp?,"This album has three good/great songs; them being ""vuela mas alto"" ""caleidescopico"" and ""no es obsesion"". The rest of the album is really terrible. At least in my view. I think they were trying to show that they can really sing, so they put in some different styles into the album. Most of them don't satisfy my ears, so I havn't been able to really listen to what the songs are saying. But in the end I wasn't really satisfied and only those three songs that I mentioned are what gave this album its rating of three. But if you like some lounge music, balads, and some dance tunes then this is the album for you."
5,Wonderful Gift!,I love this little snowman and have bought several for gifts. Everyone I have given them to has been impressed with the colors and the workmanship. Kimscrafts is excellent. Every slate I have purchased has been consistent and beautiful!
2,Insufferable characters,"The only thing that prevented me from giving this book 1star was that there were some good observsations - otherwise the characters are annoying, the writing is pretentious and the general effect is both creepy and pathetic."
1,Same ole same ole,"What a waste of paper.Same old Bush lied yada yada yada.Unless you were living under a rock when it was all happening, you have heard it all before, over and over again."
1,Bill Press is One Very Funny (and DUMB) Guy,"I just received an e-mail from Mr. Press simply stating:""you support the draft dodger. I'll support the ""decorated war hero""...The ""draft dodger"" Mr. Press must be referring to is Bill Clinton. The ""decorated war hero"" that I am so glad he is supporting must be Colonel Oliver North. Or maybe John O'Neill.I rest my case. Press is as clueless as he was when he was a political commentator in Los Angeles. This book is not worth a continental."
1,This book is one-sided,"I was able to read this unimpressive book in a matter of a few hours. Fortunately, I enjoyed a coffee or two and that was able to desensitize me to thie author's monotonous, unrelenting attacks upon the president and his principles. The demeanor style that permeates the book is a mirror image of the manner and philosophy this individual personifies and exhibits in his TV diatribes. Just as he fails to allow a guest to answer a question before he interrupts and answers for him, so too his writing style fails to allow the reader to question his pomposity and know-it-all divel. While reading the book, I can envision this fool's countenance with that ingratiating smirk to the liberal audience he so desparately wants to be a part of but fails repeatedly to be accepted."
1,Just another Bush-bashing book,"Bill Press has been an active Democratic operative for many, many years. To his credit, he argues passionately for the values he believes in. But this book is not his best work. Mr. Press just ticks off all the same old Democratic talking points. He doesn't add anything new to the debate."
1,A disappointment,"This book is a public relations dream for Wal-Mart but a big disappointment for anyone who likes good, objective, analytical business reporting. It is obvious that the author became too enamored with his access to the current Wal-Mart management. There is no balance in the book; it only presents the Wal-Mart view. It doesn't really explain how Wal-Mart has grown since Sam Walton died. It only recites ""facts"" - there's a lot of the ""what"" but there isn't a real probe of the ""how"" or the ""why."" The topic of how Wal-Mart will continue to grow (or not) is fascinating - let's hope another author will tackle it."
2,Watch CNBC piece on Wal-Mart instead,Sam Walton's autobiography is a much more interesting book and story of Wal-Mart albeit dated. This book gives you an update on the last ten years. The David LeFabor (sp?) CNBC piece run on the cable network over the holidays for the past year or so is more interesting and time better spent. The book gives you little insight into Lee Scott.
5,Just where is Mammoth Falls?,"Not many books can capture your imagination like the Mad Scientists books. I read these back in the late 60s and still have my original copy. Its been reread dozens of times and by the way where is Mammoth Falls? The location was always elusive. References to Chicago, the Air Force Base nearby, and the description of Strawberry Lake was most unusual. I keep two copies of the republished books on my shelf. I rarely rate 5 stars but this one gets it because after 40 years its still one of my favorites."
4,"Interesting and fun additional adventures, but....","I really enjoyed reading this and have bought it in both the hardcover print and the Kindle versions. However, the stories are not as iconic and the behavior of the young scientists is more temperamental and less attractive than in the original. Not perfect, in other words, but still fun. If you are a real fan, it is a must have."
2,A little disappointing,"The original Mad Scientists Club is one of my all-time favorite books. I highly recommend getting a copy for your child to get them hooked on reading.The sequel is a bit of a disappointment. The stories are nowhere near as original as the first book. Some of them start off with great promise but just sort of peter out, as if the author was just trying to end the chapter and ran out of ideas.I've read the first book about 20 times, the second I only read once. Perhaps someday I will read it again."
5,Worth waiting 30 years for,"The Mad Scientists solve a bank robbery, get outfoxed by Harmon Muldoon, save Mammoth Falls from a drought, invade the town with a UFO, then finally get even with Harmon and his gang in a satisfying and exciting sequel to The Mad Scientists' Club. Using classic technology and, of course, their noodles, the MSC romps through 5 short stories which are more complex than the originals, yet retain their smart and fun flavor. Henry thinks, Jeff leads, Mortimer snarks, Homer climbs, Charlie narrates, Harmon interferes, and Freddy and Dinky get kidnapped...twice! This book is great for boys AND girls 9-12 (and also for 42-year old women like me!) I'm so happy I found this book again after 30 years...it was worth the wait and then some!"
2,A Disappointment,"I have been a huge fan of the original ""Mad Scientist's Club"" since I was a kid. I continued to re-read it as I grew up and read it to my children. Needless to say, when I found out that another Mad Scientist's book was coming out, I could hardly wait to get my hands on it. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. None - and I mean none - of the stories reached the level of any in the original. As an example, The Flying Sorcerer was nothing more than The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake ""gone airborne"" or The Unidentified Flying Man of Mammoth Falls ""light"". My advise is to stick with the original, save your money and skip this one."
2,recinding my earlier review,"This is not a complete recinding of my earlier review it is just to give this book a lower rating. If you're looking for an excellent book on circuit analysis I would suggest trying Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis by J. David Erwin. It is much clearer than the most recent edition of Engineering Circuit Analysis by William H. Hayt. I'm reading the fifth edition, so I bet that the recent 6th edition of Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis is much better. Furthermore, I would suggest not purshasing textbooks published by McGraw-Hill. I hope this review helps you in your endeavors in engineering."
1,This books is garbage,The problems are a mess. The examples don't go with the practice problems (usually a lot more difficult). It lacks explanation of the material and everything they explain seems more complicated than it should. Hopefully my university (USF) will stop using this book because even the teacher has problems working the exercises.
4,check out student solutions manual,"This book is exceptional for the fact that the publisher sells a student solutions manual that has a large set of sample problems completely solved/worked out, all comparable to the problems in the back of the book."
3,Can someone tell me if there's going to be a sequel?,"Is it just me, or did this story finish with a lot of loose ends? On the final page, this reader was left feeling as if she'd hit a dead end while still traveling at full speed ahead.Characters were introduced that could have added amazing content, yet never revisited i.e., the grandmother and the mother's first love. I felt that the grandmother in particular could've become a strong secondary character.Perhaps there was a limit as to the length of the book that caused the abrupt ending with the only closure being that the hero and heroine found their happily ever after.Overall, this was a good read and I will buy the prequel, but again, there was no real closure and I was left feeling shortchanged."
3,Waiting for the change,"I started off with my heart shedding tears through the first few chapters, as D. goes through the emotions of losing her mother. These emotions are very close to home.But as the story continues I'm waiting for something to change to make the story more interesting, more umph. But I'm getting very discouraged. I'm entering the 15th Chapter, more than half way through the book. It sounds like it might get a little more interesting. Too late, I'm bored.Also the spelling and missing words are not becoming for this author."
1,This product is useless,"Could not adjust sensitivity low enough. Put a coffee cup down on the counter and it goes off. Blow your nose in the room, goes off. Would not recommend this for anyone. If I could have rated it as a ""0"", I would have."
2,bark stop scam,"This product does not work. Oh yes, it makes a high pitched noise when you do the ""test"" but does nothing to get the attention of the barking dog. A waste of money."
1,Viatek Bark-Stop a waste of $,"I purchased this device because my neighbor's dog barks whenever we are outside. I spoke to them about the dog, but there is little they can do about it themselves. The problem with the bark-stop is that it will not go off when the dog barks! It is only ~20 feet away and the dog barks very loud (big dog), but the thing only goes off when I move or bump it. I tried all settings etc and no luck. I don't recommend you buy this device and would hope there is something more effective on the market."
1,Does not work,This did not work at all!!!!!!!!!! The dog actually barked more. We are returning this item.
2,Outdated,"This product didn't do much for my situation. The next-door neighbors got two puppies for Christmas, but now they are of barking age and tend to bark in the mornings. I bought this product thinking it would be my cure-all. Unfortunately, a fence and some trees are difficult for this product to penetrate. It needs a clear line-of-sight in the ultra-sonic mode so it is very difficult to use for my purpose without very clever placement. More importantly:This product is outdated. A much better product is the 'Super Bark Stop.' It's by the same company, however it has more control such as a Volume Setting, # of barks Setting, and is battery powered allowing more placement options."
2,Annoys my neighbor more than my dog barking,"I purchased this unit because my neighbors have repeatedly complained about my dog barking while I am away at work. On their suggestion I bought this unit and after several days of use my neighbor complained about the noise the unit was making and that it did nothing to impede any barking my dog felt like participating in. This did not work for me (or my neighbor) but it may work for another dog. I believe this unit was also set off by wind and other non-bark noises which, in my opinion, makes it less effective as the dog will not necessarily connect that the noise is supposed to mean ""stop barking"". As an aside, I find it humorous that all the pictures of barking dogs on company websites are the 2 breeds I have (Rottweiler mix and German Shepherd)."
1,Viatek Professional Bark Stop Dog Bark Doesn't Stop Dogs From Barking.,"""Viatek Professional Bark Stop Dog Bark"" doesn't work. It is obvious that the dogs are aware of the device because their ears perk up when a sound is emitted after they bark; however, they continue to bark. I have tested the device on several occassions by turning the device off and monitoring the dogs, and then by turning it on to watch for changes, yet the results are the same."
1,Dogs still barking.,This product did not have any impact on my dogs barking at all.My dogs would stand right next to this and back just like they normally do. I often turned the alarm to audible just to verify that it was even working. After three weeks of trying I finally returned the trainer.
1,Waste of Money,"We were trying to stop our neighbor's dog from obnoxiously barking at the fence every time we're outside sitting on the deck to relax. Installed the bark stop transmitter and no matter what setting we put it on, it went completely unnoticed by this golden retriever. We tested it first with the audio signal and it did sound each time the dog barked, but in ultrasonic mode, the dog wasn't deterred at all. It says on the box it doesn't work under certain barking conditions (like protection barking), it's mainly for nuisance barkers. We've had it up for 2 weeks. NO CHANGE at all."
1,Cheap and not made for outdoors,"We bought 3 different bark deterrent devices. This one is by far the worst. The design is very poor and can not withstand any outdoor use.Mine broke apart at the plug after only one use. I have never had a power box break while unplugging it from the wall. The plastic was brittle and thin.As far as the usefulness of this product, it would constantly get set off even when turning it on or off. The area where the switches are located is covered with a useless plastic piece that has a long screw to cover it. If you turn it on and try to screw the cover on, it will go off.I would never buy anything from this company again."
3,Jury still out...,"I suspect that my Pug Puppy hears the negative sound, but prefers to bark through the annoyance. I will try ""audible"" setting for the next week and give more input."
1,Sent item that had already been returned.,"I received the Viatek Professional Bark Stop in today's mail. I followed the instructions and it never worked. I then started going thru the paper work again and found a note from the previous owner ""Worked for one day and then quit."" Obviously I was shipped an item that had already been returned....and NO I didn't not ask for a replacement."
1,Does not work as described,"I purchased this product with the skepticism from reading all the other reviews but figured I'd give it a try myself. Well, the bad reviews are dead on. The item came to us and already had something broken floating around inside but still worked so we tried it. The ""ultrasonic"" setting appeared to stay on all the time regardless if the dog was barking or not and the regular setting would shut the machine down completely if the dog barked for more than 5 minutes. I am returning this product and would not recommend anyone to purchase this for training their dog from not barking. Citronella collars work WAY better!"
1,DONT BUY,"Great Idea, liked that it ran off of DC current, Loved that it had an extra cord to move the device around. But It has to function to be effective. Lights and everything works, but even a basset hound barking loudly in the same room did not cause it to go off. Should have trusted the reviews I read and not wasted my time. Have to tap the mic area to set it off, so I know it can function, just think that the size of the dog needed to set this off would be on the scale of livestock."
2,Does not work as expected,"This device seems nice and well build, at first begin it worked fine, not as a 100% bark stopper in terms of full eficiency, but overall it worked, a few weeks later it seems to be in good working operation but does not stop dogs barks, so I just give 2 stars. Cheap devices are expected to give low satisfaction."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought this device, hoping it would help with my dog's barking. However, the dog acted as if the device did not exists after 2 weeks. The product is a sham and takes advantage of pet owners. Do not buy."
1,not worth the bother,"I was so hopeful that this would work as I have a barker! My golden retrievor is a handful when it comes to him wanting attention from me all the time. I can't even sit for 10 minutes so we gave this a try.Moved it to a few locations as instructed and almost 30 days later he just continued to look at it, bark at it more and then kept barking without any regard for it. We tried both the silent mode and the high pitch mode we could hear - nothing worked. I have now given up and hope he outgrows hisbehavior."
1,Bark Alert,The bark alert does not work at all. We have two Yorkies and we have had the machine for a month and it has not affected them at all.
2,Not so good on older dogs....,"I bought this to help deal with an older dog next door. I feel really bad for the dog, but hey, I gotta get sleep once in a while too. I had high hopes for this device after reading many of the online reviews but am sad to say it failed miserably. Perhaps because the dog is so old, it may have lost some of its hearing. I don't know. Either way, it didn't work for me. Setting the tone to the lower (audible) version did nothing more than frighten my cat and irritate me everytime the dog barked. So that didnt work either. :-(My recommendation would be to not buy this if the dog you are attempting to silence is older."
3,...,"...I would NOT suggest his gratuitously heavy and exorbitantly priced book as an introductory text. In many cases the language is rather complicated, and if you want an overview of the history of Philosophy, you can probably find one that won't take you the greater part of your life to read. As a reference book that lives on your shelf and only comes out to play in the case that you might need to consult it on a date, personality, event, etc., it is, however, superb. My suggestion is that you should NOT buy this book unless you A, are a masochist and/or learned in the often stilted style of Philosophic writings, or B, in need of an awesome reference on the history of Philosophy..."
4,Floor mat,The new floor mats were ok and they fit well.I thought they were a bit pricey but everything has gone sky high.
3,I did?,"With a title like ""Heard It On The Radio"", one might expect to find a majority of songs that one once heard on the radio. Well let me tell ya something. That's not exactly the case here. I lived and breathed radio in the 80's and it wasn't until the formats became so predictable that I gave up on traditional FM. That said, I was able to recognize only five of these songs, and that's stretching it some. She Looks a Lot Like You, Hot Cherie, 10-9-8, No More Lies, and Dreams all struck me as familiar, some more than others. The rest, while occasionally interesting, left me shaking my head wondering where they might have been heard before. All in all, this is a great concept and it's too bad that Renaissance Records no longer exists because I'd keep buying them as long as they kept releasing them. You never know what you might find."
4,"Yes, these were on the air","I put off purchasing this collection for too long, having the other two volumes in my collection for years. It is super to hear these songs again! Music production was awesome in the '80s. This is a cranker!"
4,Very Handy Replacement,The replacement cartridge came in handy and was very affordable compared to the original Samsung cart. Shipment came on the day of delivery and now I can start printing the things I need. Thanks
4,Nice for the price,"This was a nice little item with reasonable sized products in a nice box. My kid gave it to his teacher as a present and she glowed.. so that's good news. Box was nice, it didn't look cheap but at 6.99 I found it to be a nice gift for office type parties or other comparable present exchanges. Smelled nice too! Overall 4 stars"
4,A+,I like this product a lot. The smell is genuine and leaves you feeling and smelling just like sunflowers. This is a nice addition to my other bath and body products.
2,The yellow basket was dirty and wet,"I bought this product from Amazon a week ago with $5 discount promotion. However, when the basket arrived, I was very disappointed because the yellow basket was dirty and wet (inside of the plastic cover!!!). It cannot be given as a gift to anyone now."
1,Not the exact same item shown,I did not receive the item number I ordered. This is the same sub-standard junk I could buy at Walmart for a lot less.Thanks anyway! Why the substitution?
5,Great product...awesome price!,"This is the only way to buy caraway seeds, if you enjoy baking with them. The small packages are perfect for the freezer, with one in the fridge. These have a great taste perfect for a nice rye bread."
1,Truly amateurish biography,"The greatest actress in the world deserves a masterpiece of a biography-and this book is no masterpiece. Aside from many inaccuracies, it's weirdly short on information about it's subject. Entire sections are about other people (eg. the inspriration for Jane Tennison-interesting, but not appropriate in a book about someone else!) The author seems to be trying desperately to fill his book, and too much of it is useless information. A real disappointment. While I collect every movie and item I can get my hands on that has Helen Mirren in it, not even I would buy this book (thankfully I found it at my library). Any pertinent information it contains can be found easily on the internet. I hope a good writer out there is planning on honoring this divine woman with a stellar biography. It's long overdue."
2,Mics,Work fine. Battery compartment is poorly designed and I have to tape it shut to keep battery from falling out. They work. amazon was great.
2,Comfy but should have my size,"I have 34 only because that's the smallest it comes in. I can wear the pair for a month and since it stretches, it keeps moving. Olga or Amazon does not carry the size 32s. There are many out there like me. Please make 32s for the petites out here.Comfy but there are not enough size choices."
4,"great album, but, where's the vocals","i got this album and went straight to the CD player, popped it in and enjoyed the best album i've heard in a long time. Imagine Jar of Flies(Alice in Chains) and Superunknown(Soundgarden)mixed together with a dash of Bob Dylan folkiness. The musicianship is incredible, make no mistakes, these guys can play. The only problem I have with the album is that you really can't hear the vocals that well, almost like they forgot to add them in until the last minute and ran out of available volume. They're almost muddled in spots, not as clear as they were on their self-titled debut, but with much stronger musical chops. I hope this band does well, so that Newsted kicks himself for jumping ship to join up with Voivod(what a joke, worse excuse for a band, like a poor mans dream theatre or something--they wicked suck)Anyway, great record, super musicians, if you enjoyed the first, you'll have to enjoy the second."
4,Echobrain have changed but still is pretty good,"Since Jason Newsted departure, this peculiar band have experimented changes, if Newsted provided maybe a 20% of heavy sound in their first cd now this 20% has becoming just a 10% heavy, now they sound a lot more alternative and even more funny than before, this band needed to take more seriously this direction , after all Jason cant deny his love for Metal and returned to it with Voivod , and theres a number of side projects he has achieved such as ""Pappawheelie"" punk style, ""IR8"" kinda Sepultura sound and the trash project ""Sexoturica"" all this projects with the collaboration of very well known musicians like tom hunting from Exodus, Devin Towsend from Straping Young Lad, and andreas kisser from sepultura (awesome cds all this by the way im so happy i own) , for this reason Echobrain now without Jason on bass have released ""Glean"" interesting albumHM"
4,excellent series,"the third book in ""A Knight's Story"" by Paul Stewart, illustrated by Chris Riddell. written in first person. Sir Knight is drawn into a plot to discover treasure and is forced to deal with a shifty merchant.. a lovely maiden and a wretched dragon! Stewart's style of writing is sarcastic, realistic and extremely entertaining. his characters are colorful (which Riddell brings to life) written for a younger audience, just means they are meant to be entertaining.. writing for children is tricky.. have to hold their attention, they won't plow through a book like ""grown-ups"" will.definitely recommend."
2,pointless,"The 98 custom is amazing, but for the price you could almost get a flatline barrel instead. A 21"" barrel is useless, anything over 14"" will increase friction and not accuracy, while increasing the the chances you will be seen due to the impractical size. If you want range and and accuracy go with the flatline. The remote is bound to get caught on things, I have seen it happen. If you want the true altimate sniper package, get a tippmann 98 custom with a flateline barrel, it is smaller and more effective."
1,Bad Book for beginner......,I think this is a bad book for beginnerit simplify too much syntaxIt is bad for biginner
2,Use the set 4 times and throw it away,I usually love Melissa and Doug Products. This water color set was anything but wonderful. My daughter used the set all of 3 times before some of the colors were almost gone. All of the colors were muddled from my daughter's use and didn't come clean quickly like the Crayola watercolor sets do.
2,"Colors dull, didn't last beyond one painting session","Although my almost 3 yr old daughter had fun painting with these watercolors, they were not vibrant and were quite dull colored. We tried using less water for higher saturation but the colors still looked very water-downed. And if you didn't mix the paint with enough water, nothing would get on the brush. We've tried Crayola and its color saturation and vibrancy is far better than this Melissa & Doug set. So the painting session was fine but the results were disappointing. And we've finished a few colors already just in one painting session."
3,Typical paint set,"There's nothing special about this product. It's just like a normal paint set. I do like that it shuts closed tight, but my daughter had a hard time opening it!"
3,this is TINY.,"Not sure why the pic made me think this was a bigger item, but I was stunned to see how tiny this was for $6. I do not usually do reviews, but wanted to on this so others would not make the same mistake."
2,sad little set,"maybe i missed it in the description that this would be the SO SMALL, but it is NOT what I expected from M & D. It was a gift but way to cheap and small for a gift. Big disappointment!"
5,send me an E Mail,"I am a retired author of published books and a professional busines and promotional writer. I am also the founder of The Internet Hunting Society = firstihs.org. I would be happy to review any hunting books. Just notifyme of the titles and send them to me.My address is: 255 Bayville Road, Locust Valley, N. Y. ii560-0173"
4,An Inspiration,"I was thoroughly inspired by reading this book. It seemed to me to be a little slow developing at the beginning, due to a fairly complex family history. Even this should be interesting to people who like history from the perspective of people who lived it. It is well organized, and provides a good description of the environment that nurtured this God-inspired writer. Janette Oke's life experiences are so easy to identify with, and her dependence on God so well portrayed that it is an inspiration to me. It is also fascinating to learn how one of my favorite writers arrived at her mission in life."
1,"Very short little ""book"" of questionable value","This is an EXTREMELY short book. It is mostly just questions to fill-in-the-blank. But the questions are all so basic that I didn't need help from a book! One page is ""list a memory from each decade"" and then lists the 1920's, 1930's, 1940's and so on, with just space for ** a ** memory. Yes, ""a"" memory --- for a DECADE? This is a self-published, print on demand book, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing, but clearly no commercial publisher would ever touch this - it's of little to no value. I've bought several of these type books over the years and this one is - by far - the worst of the lot."
5,Great,My grandson loves ONLY this blanket!! He is 2 years old and He's has had this brand of blanket sence 6 months
4,"Good product, MUCH cheaper elsewhere.",Great quality but the price on Amazon is very high. $15-$20 for the 64 pack at Costco or Sam's Club.
2,wrong item sent to me,I was disappointed with the items I ordered because they are not the type that I wanted. They came with creamy cocktails which are different from the chocolate liqueurs with original spirits.
4,... not perfect but this is a dance album that is solidly European,"Sure, this is not a perfect dance album - but it is a solid release and his best release (save his ""greatest Hits"" disc) in a decade. There are pop, ballads and three very strong eurodance tracks on it - something America should get better at appreciating over depressing rap and boring house music. The top tunes are ""Because Of You"", ""We Are What We Are"" and the Eurovision hit ""Vampires Are Alive"". If you like your dance music with lots of vocals and piles of melodies - this is for you. Jason E Davis"
4,My first read on suicide,"""Sanity and Grace"" was the first book dealing with suicide that I read after losing my own son to suicide. This was a perfect ""first"" because Judy shares her relationship with her son with dignity and grace. Thank you for being gentle with us Ms. Collins."
5,a gift which I borrowed!,"I bought these for my son-in-law, who has a bachelor's in computer science and a doctorate in engineering-- and an exquisite sense of humor. And I even waited a month before borrowing them! lolIf you've seen Futurama, then you know it's good. If you haven't, you should! My s-i-l gets all the science jokes, and is kind enough to explain without going into detail that would confuse my fuzzy old brain. But you really don't have to be be a scientist to enjoy Futurama. I like it so much better than ""The Simpsons"", so if you're not a fan of the original from Groening, don't assume you won't like this one. The pithy jokes, and the amazing voice actor talent make it a pleasure.And this was a bargain, too. You can see this show at places like Netflix, but I like having the DVDs handy...oh, did I forget to give these back??? ;-)"
5,Excellent collection,"The show Futurama is superbly funny and in most cases, extremely tasteful as well. I have unending praise for the show and with the unfortunately limited number of seasons that were produced, they never had a bad one. I heartily recommend this set, which represents the entire collection of Futurama episodes. You will not regret watching them over and over. They're worth every penny."
5,"Great Series, Very Underrated","I loooooved Futurama, and all the sets are great, so you know, if you were gonna buy them all anyway, you might as well buy them in this package.Every Set has great features, each one including Deleted Scenes, and the Shows all look great(well it isn't old anyway so no one should expect any worse). Some folks complain about there being no play all option, but ehh, It doesn't really bother me.So anyway, I don't have a single bad thing to say about these sets, so if you like the series and were thinking about buying the DVD's, buy them, they're great."
5,Cult Following,"Futurama never got the respect it deserves because of it's more obscure math and science humor. It's a show targeting nerds, in some ways similar to the Dilbert animated series that only went 2 seasons.This is the complete series... UNTIL IT COMES BACK IN 2010. That's an important caveat. This is all the seasons until it resumes production."
5,Futurama -- It's highly addictive!,"Futurama is easily one of my favorite shows. Not only is it hilarious the first watch through, but they cram in so many little less obvious jokes that it stands up surprisingly well to re-watching. Unlike some other popular animated comedies, Futurama manages to tell a cohesive story throughout the episode, rather than using a combination of non-sequiturs and repetition to simulate comedy. (OK, I'm a Family Guy fan as well. Just don't tell anybody.)[...]"
5,"futurama is like the simpsons, except its totally different","yea that made no sense, but basically, if you enjoy the style of humor in the simpsons, a mix of slapstick comedy mixed w/ clever double meanings, and all in all good jokes, look no further. One thing this show does similar to the simpsons is recognize the flaws in the setting of the show (space future) by poking fun at it. An area the show excels is telling a story in individual episodes while maintaining plot lines over the course of the seasons.Very original setting, character designs, and a lotta genuinely heartfelt moments. Top notch stuff."
5,Hilarious show,"Great show, sad to see Simpson's still on the air regurgitating stories and yet this gem got canceled."
2,"nice bags, but don't last in the sun","I bought these to use around the outside of our greenhouse, and after being exposed to the sun for less than two months they're deteriorating very badly. We double bagged them in the first place, and unfortunately both layers are already brittle and have several tears throughout. I can literally tear the material like paper at this point. We live in West Texas so the sun and the heat is relatively harsh so I knew we would have to replace them over time, but I definitely expected them to last longer than two months. The bags are nice and strong with good ties and we were able to fill them with plenty of sand, but the material just doesn't hold up over time when exposed to the elements."
4,bags alot,"using these to build an earthbag wall.....product is very good.....very fast shipping. The size, quality, etc. were exactly as expected."
1,very poor quality,These bags were very poor quality. They turned to powder when you touched them within a week or two. I would NEVER buy these again! I hate to even give them 1 star.
4,Exactly what we wanted at a great price,These bags are exactly what we wanted and were a better deal than anything we could get locally. We filled all 100 with sand and had no issues. Thankfully we haven't had the water to test them!
2,Find Others,"Bags don't last more than 2 months outside in weather. Used to anchor a tarp and 1/3 full, all rip open when tried to move 2 months later, would not buy again"
5,Great sandbags from Anazon and Trademark supplies,I ordered these sandbags for our fireworks display as a safety precaution to hold down the tubes to make it a safe display.. These work very well.. The seller is quick at shipping them out and we will deffinately use this seller again..
5,Totally unexpected,"This movie is really original and keeps you guessing as to what is really going on.The story almost completely takes place inside a radio station, yet manages to tell a gripping story.The ending is not what you expect.Very unique experience."
3,"Weird...yeah, weird...","Let me start by saying that I'm huge lover of zombies and as such I bought this film because the preview looked promising. I liked the movie and I'm glad I bought it, as opposed to renting it, because I'm not sure what just happened. (Also, I think I'd still be waiting for it from NetFlix) The filming quality is decent, as are all of the other elements of the film, but given the lack of a set variety it is apparent that this is a pretty low budget operation. If you want blood and guts this is not for you. This is one of the more thought provoking zombie films I've seen. (Whether it is due to confusion, true ingeniousness, or pretension, is up for debate.) I still don't really understand what causes zombies in this world. I would have given it four stars, but I know I tend to like things that many people don't care for. I recommend you see it if you like this type of movie, but you have to approach it with an open mind."
4,pretty good,"Good story line. Not a lot of the effects that I'm used to seeing in 'zombie' movies, but it really didn't need it."
5,Unique non-zombie zombie film.,"Stephen McHattie excels in this ""certain English words are a virus"" movie. As a hard drinking recently demoted shock jock now working for a tiny talk radio station in Pontypool, Ontario, some callers start sounding a mite odd. Then their ""chopper"" goes down. It can and does only get worse from there. Really gets the claustrophobia going and a nice original idea. The movie is a low budget one room play. The BD also has a good commentary track with the writer, producer and director all sitting around talking about both this film and their aspirations for two more, which I don't think is gonna happen. There's also a 58 min radio play on the disc. But no subtitles. There are a few scenes where I'd like to know what was said but the off camera words are too muddled for any sound system to pick up. Too bad. It's the only negative thing I could say about this disc. Watch past the end credits for a great scene. 8/10"
3,Pontypool,"Didn't really live up to the hype of being ""one of the best"" zombie movies ever. It was shot in an interesting way, but the dialog fell short of expectations, given this was supposed to take place in a talk radio studio. Also, I expected the dialog to really carry the movie, given the lack of gore and poor special effects/make-up. Overall, it wasn't that good, definitely watchable."
1,What the...?,"This was a film MADE for zombies by a zombie. If you have any taste and enjoy good thrillers, stay away from this movie. It will only suck up your time and leave you with the sensation that some brain cells have gone missing. If irritation were entertainment then this would meet the criteria. But it only stirs up interest and misleads you into thinking it will lead somewhere. This is a thriller for people who don't really appreciate the idea of an actual plot with their thrillers. At 96 minutes, it plays like twice the running time. If you love french, find the thriller genre too anxiety provoking for your delicate truffle-loving soul, and wish we could all just sing songs of hope in the middle of tension, in lieu of actually... umm... resolving the damned plot, then this is the movie for you! Otherwise, run! And save those 96 minutes of your life, while you still can!"
1,So Dumb,Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb movie. The concept was almost interesting but still a dumb dumb dumb dumb dump movie.
1,Awful,I'm a huge fan of the genre and was extremely dissapointed in this snoozer. Nothing happened in this movie just an old guy in a cowboy hat blabbering about something called pontypool. I expected low action not no action. It was free and I still wanta refund!!!!!
1,"Good premise, but never delivers .....",I had high hopes for this movie but it never went anywhere. It was a waste of my time.
1,PontyPOO. They should have saved the cost of a letter.,"Seven-year-old toilet humor title aside, this movie was HORRIBLE. It was clearly originally a radio broadcast but even without that, the story itself is awful. It piggy-backs on one of the oldest conundrums we have ALL inevitably found ourselves in (perhaps as a seven year-old??): saying a word over and over to the point of it losing all sense of meaning. That is a VERY loose basis for this movie admittedly but where the story goes from there is just as pointless and painful.This film actually served as the equivalent of the spoken virus it circles around trying to explain. I felt brain-dead and incapable of proper sentences for days after watching this atrocity of film. Screw all of the 4-stars!!! I wish I could give this a NEGATIVE rating."
1,Shut up or die?? Where are the zombiess??,"Honestly, this is one of the worst zombies films I have ever seen. I mean where are the zombies? Où sont les zombies? The movie says on the cover ""One of the 25 best zombies movies of all time"" WHHAATTT? How do you said something like that. It should say ""One of the 25 worst zombies movies of ALL TIME"". I love zombies movies and this one did not have zombies. It just have one girl puking blood. Did you call that Zombies? This movie is a piece of garbage for any zombie fan. ZOMBIE MOVIES ARE: The return of the living dead, Dawn of the dead, Day of the dead, Evil dead, and some many. DO NOT DARE TO CALL THIS MOVIE A ZOMBIE MOVIE. On the back of the cover it says: ""Grade: A. One-of-a kind zombie film"" It should say ""Grade: F. PLEASE DON'T BOTHER TO BUY THIS MOVIE."" I mean if you can rent this movie please do it you may enjoy it or you may get dissapointed like me."
2,"Should have been a 30 minute audio-book. Talk, talk, uninteresting talk ...","First 30 minutes has decent dialog, but then it becomes tedious.New Rule: If can't afford action, pay the best writers to have witty dialog with at least some words that give a great visual. You don't have to watch this movie, all you have to do is listen, as there is nothing to see and not that much to visualize.Oh well ...."
2,Pontypool,"Some good acting and the set and costumes were really well done, but not a plot concept I can accept. Even for a movie, the suspension of belief necessary here is just too much. Really? A virus spread by hearing certain words!"
2,What a let-down...,This movie was stupid. And that is as intellectual a statement as I can make about it. What promise it had though... Could have been great.
1,A turd by any other name is still a turd...,"As a lifelong fan of movies, particularly horror & sci-fi, I have to say that this Pontypool is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. It pretends to be a zombie movie but has the dumbest take on zombies ever put to film. If you want to go out on a limb and call these ""mind-infected"" or ""brain-tampered"" zombies, you would be doing this crapper a huge favor. Not scary or intense at all. Poorly acted, shoddy makeup, ridiculous premise & execution...I could go on and on. The only good thing I could say about this was that it was sooooo bad, it actually provided plenty of material to rip on for hours after watching it. The idiotic ""KISS...IS KILL..."" turned into a lame-brained mantra for myself & the people I watched this with. Why I sat through the whole thing, I could never tell you.Skip this unless you have an appetite for really awful movies."
4,"Great flick - but not your usual ""zombie"" movie.","Having purchased Pontypool without ever seeing it (could not find it through any rental service), we were really happy we did. It's worth purchasing and worth watching more than once to see what you may have missed the first time. It's an intelligent movie about chaos happening in the town of Pontypool, all from the perspective of 3 folks underground in their radio station (and one roving reporter). It's extremely suspenseful as your always waiting for something happening...waiting for something to... get in! The suspense is the best and the acting is fantastic. I'd recommend this to any fan of apocalypic type flicks - but not if your only in it for the gore (you'll be disappointed if that's the only reason you watch). Great movie all around - recommended!!"
3,Meh.,"I read some pretty great reviews of this film, so I purchased it but decided to keep my expectations low. The beginning of the film reminded me a bit of ""World War Z,"" and one could imagine the horror that was unravelling outside the radio station; however, somewhere in the middle of the movie and especially after the ""revelation,"" the film just fizzled and died. I can't explain it. The ""revelation"" in the book, I'm sure, was much better and more complex. The introduction of the doctor's character, in my opinion, ruined the film. I'm not going to give too much information away in order to save the surprise for others. I can't say I highly recommend this movie. I didn't hate it. Obviously others love it, but if you are a fan of the traditional zombie genre, I would leave it alone."
2,I only gave it two stars because of originality,"I actually couldn't finish it. It started interesting, but then turned into a crappy descent into madness. Any suspense left about half-way through. I really don't like this movie and am angry that I spent the money on it."
2,You probably need assistance to enjoy this movie...,"...while Stephen McHattie was awesome, and carried the only good thing about this movie, I think you need to be high to really like this movie. We were not. It was bad."
2,Drive In Type Movie,"While watching this movie, I suddenly felt as if I hopped into a time machine and was transported back in time to the sixties. This is the type of movie I recall watching at the drive in. That is pretty much my review. I gave the movie 2 stars for the good feeling I got from memories of better days."
3,Better as audio only,"Pontypool lends itself more to an audio-only format, like the original War of The Worlds radio broadcast. In fact, CBC has made an audio play available.For a ""zombie"" movie, there is minimal action, not very much gore, and the audio is really what carries the story.I thought the movie was good, and the concept is very interesting and different.I would rent/borrow to check it out before you purchase to make sure it is your thing."
5,Great product,"Very strong and fits all of my rifle calibers to boot. I should have bought another one, just to leave it setup for my AR15."
3,Okay Cleaning Rod,"I got this ""one-piece"" coated cleaning rod to help protect the bore during cleaning but the coating is starting to flake off near the patch-holder and at the screw joint. It's really not ""one-piece"" because the patch holder screws onto the rod. I don't know if the one I got just had a poor coating job or if the solvents are just too much for the coating. I think I'll go with a carbon fiber rod in the future. I also thought the 33"" length would be plenty long but with at least one brand of bore guide in my Weatherby Vanguard S2 .30-06 the patch will not fully clear the end of the muzzle - works okay with another shorter brand of bore guide though."
4,Music of the famous,"When I saw that one of Monica Lewinski's favorite albums is ""Sexual Healing,"" I had to buy this book. It's got a bunch of lists from interesting people. Checking out their musical tastes is really fun. This is a cool book that's more than worth a look."
4,"Lovely, soothing album","I picked up this album because it was on sale, and the blurb on the back sounded interesting. Heidi is a Celtic-folk singer similar to Kate Rusby. Her voice is sugary sweet and her melodies float along like a summer breaze. This is Sunday morning coffee music. A nice outing for a promising, young siren."
1,Boring Music with no Substance,"Heidi Talbot has a lot of growing up to do. I recently saw her perform with Cherish the Ladies and she has NO stage presence. She startes at the ground while her bandmates perform and she looks so bored that she drains and depletes your energy down to nothing. After seeing her and then listening to her CD, I fell asleep due to boredul. Please save your money and buy a different singers album."
5,Very good book,"This is an excellent textbook. I've just completed an undergraduate course in computer graphics using this text and it made the course much easier and more interesting. It clearly explains the content using appropriate examples. However, this book is for an upper level college course and is not suitable for beginners."
1,Errr...,"I start reading the book as it arrives. In chapter 2, I faced with several problems.The code to generate 2D recursive Triangle and 3D one does not produce the same result printed in the book. I look up online for source code for the book from Pearson, but they are all private (require login). I google for the source and come to several class website. Their code produce like what the book shows. I start to compare between the code, their vertex and orthographic view parameter are different. I go back to orthographic view => ""detail in Chapter 5"". Okay sure, no problem. Some material in chapter 1 can be skipped because they are just general knowledge (not even related to computer science).Also, the text have many error in code. I don't want to list it out. Try the code out and you see."
1,It's the first edition,Disappointed. It's not what I expected and the book cover is also not like the picture showed. The book I received is the first edition. Will NEVER consider buying books from this seller.
2,"Too much trivia, not enough historical background","I thought this would be a nice way to brush up on my U.S. history, but unfortunately the treatment is quite shallow and much of the dialog deviates from salient historical information. More suitable for grade schoolers or the very casual student."
1,Horribly distracting dialog,"After listening to ""Don't know much about History,"" I still don't know much about history. The dialog, acting, is so bad, it pushes the listener away from hearing any of the content. You know that voice of a man or woman, when they go up an octave, and over emphasize the whole question? Well, that's what is throughout these audio cd's. And they crowbar questions between the asker and the reader. I mean, VERY big crowbars. Anyway, I couldn't make it through the second disc. It was THAT bad. The content was scattered, disconnected. I might have learned a thing or two if I didn't feel like I was in third grade all over again."
1,"Works as a trashbag, but smell is awful.","Whatever they use to make these bags smell ""good"" is very far from pleasant. I honestly prefer the way garbage smells over these bags. Every time I open my cabinet to throw the trash away, all I can smell are these trash bags and it is repulsing. It makes me avoid throwing things away and taking out the garbage (much less putting in a new bag) because the smell is so strong and nauseating. Never again will I buy these. I'm going back to the good old normal trash bags. I shouldn't have to avoid that area of my kitchen just because of a trash bag. I mean really."
2,Red tie strap breaks nearly every time...,"I like the idea of these bags -- with built in pleasant odor. However, every time I place these bags on a standard size 13 gallon trash bin around the rim, they break rather easily. And if the tie string doesn't break around the rim then it will almost always break when tying it. I've rarely had this problem with other bags especially from well known companies like Glad. The bag itself never leaked but I like to tie up my trash as pictured on the front of the box. Good luck on doing that! It's possible that I received a bad batch, but I think I'll try a different manufacture next time."
5,everything you want in an online purchase,"I boughtGlad Drawstring ForceFlex Odor Shield Tall Kitchen Bags, 13 Gallon, 34 Count Bags (Pack of 6)for $31.76.It's what I wanted, it was cheap, and it arrived in a two days.With ""Subscribe And Save"", they were at worst only 20% cheaper than other sites and at best over 150% cheaper than local brick and mortars."
4,Good vest - runs big,This is a well made photo vest with ample pockets. The vest runs large and is a little to long for most people. I would also like to see more Velcro on the pockets for a more secure seal. Overall the quality is good.
2,DISAPOINTING SEQUEL,"""UNIVERSAL SOLDIER"" WAS A WORLD-WIDE SMASH HIT,GROSSING OVER 100 MILLION DOLLARS WORLDWIDE,IT MAKES ME ASK,""WHY WOULD TWO SEQUELS TO ""UNIVERSAL SOLDIER"" COME OUT 6 YEARS LATER AND BE BACK TO BACK DIRECT-TO-VIDEO?"".I SOON FOUND OUT THE ANSWER WHEN PURCHASING THIS VIDEO. THIS CHEAP EXCUSE FOR A FILM HAS ALMOST NO PLOT,NONE OF THE ORIGINAL STARS IN IT,THE ACTOR'S THAT TAKE THE PLACE OF THE ORIGINAL ACTOR'S LOOK NOTHING AT ALL LIKE THE ORIGINAL ACTOR'S,IT CLEARLY HAD A VERY LOW BUDGET,AND APPEARS TO BE SHOT BACK TO BACK WITH THE SECOND ""UNIVERSAL SOLDIER"" BECAUSE ALL OF THE CREDIT'S (EXCLUDING THE ACTOR'S)ON THE COVER OF 2 AND 3 ARE THE SAME. ALSO,BURT REYNOLDS MUST BE PRETTY DESPERATE FOR AN ACTING ROLE THESE DAYS TO STOOP DOWN TO A DIRECT TO VIDEO CHEAPIE TRYING TO CASH IN ON THE SUCESS OF THE ORIGINAL.BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THE FILM IS GOOD IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SENSELESS VIOLENCE AND POOR ACTING."
5,EXCELLENT SCHOOL OR DRESS SHORTS,"I purchased these for my son, who is quite a Husky boy. He at 8 years old, by height and size looks as if he is 12-14 years old.These pants are wonderful! My son loves them, he can run, jump, rough house on the playing field with them. The food stains thus far, have all washed out in cold water without stain remover.They look good. Very masculine looking cut. Excellent product. I will continue to buy this brand as he grows! EXCELLENT!"
4,too 'dorkie' for my grandson,"The shorts looked as though they were well made, but I don't even know if they fit. I bought them for my grandson but he wouldn't even try them on, let alone wear them to school."
4,celadon bud vase,"this celadon bud vase is a very pretty green. this was my first experience with celadon items. the price was low which encouraged me to try it. i still prefer more colorful handpainted vases, but this looks nice against the darker green of my bonzai trees."
5,A Great Woman's Epic,"This poem is awsome! Hard Country is an exciting and moving epic poem about a woman's life. Doubiago uses a road trip to to explore her own personal issues. The searching theme in this peom is so moving that even the reader will become involved in the search for her Ramon. A powerfull poem for anybody who likes Whitman's Song of Myself, William's Patterson, or H.D.'s Trilogy. This poem will be a classic!"
3,"the ending is slightly too ""happy""","Nathalie Dagenais is a 19 year old girl studying to be a lawyer. New to the city of Montreal, she will soon discover the world of porn. One day, her father (Michel Cté) comes across her picture on the Internet and wants to find her before it's too late, and before she makes what he thinks is a mistake.The story goes from past to present, when a police officer (Christian Bégin) investigates the death of Max Bissonnette, a man Nathalie knew.Michel Cté gives an excellent performance as usual. Karine Vanasse is well cast. Bégin is surprisingly good.The story unfortunately is a little predictable, as the movie nears the end. And the ending itself is a little too ""happy"" for the context.Still a decent thriller, especially for a Quebec production. Worth watching once."
3,"Cute, inexpensive but too narrow","Got these for $20 I think, and at that price they're well worth it.Simple and cute, but like many of these shoes (from these manufacturers) they're just toooo narrow for my toes. They can't be worn for long."
2,Pretty Much a Slog,"Without a doubt, this book is a big undertaking and doing it well has to be very difficult. There were a number of interesting chapters, but the style of writing, compound sentences combined with hyphenated phrases that went on for line upon line, made it very difficult to read and follow. This was probably the most frustrating book I've ever read, and I only finished it as a matter or principle."
2,Not Thorough Enough,"Billed as the ""Most Complete Referece""... I pray not. I was specifically looking for a -How To- on integrating a database app to my web site using VI. It goes on at great length about doing it, doesn't parallel or explain the accompanying samples on CD very well and NEVER says how to implement the project, that is, get it onto the ISP server. Other areas that I have tried to explore are similarly lacking in the final pieces of the puzzle to put VI into action on a working Web Site."
2,Very uneven; poorly edited,A fair overview of Visual InterDev.The book has many authors ... and it shows. Very uneven from chapter-to-chapter. Needs a strong editor to bring consistency.I encountered a number of errors in the book and the enclosed CD
2,Didn't agree with me,"I took the product for about a week. Didn't notice any impact, except that it made my stomach burn for about an hour. Probably should be taken on a full stomach."
4,50 Guitars cd's out of stock & not exact copy of original,"I wish to order South of the Border Volume 1 and find it is out of stock.. when will you get more? I also note that the Silver Note Records is reissuing 50 guitars music and I sincerely hope that these are exact copies of the original recordings..I agree with the reviewers who complained about the absence of a some lovely songs, and having heard the old 8 track with the full original song list, would urge the record company to produce exact copies, but I don't know how to contact them!"
5,Office music,Every track presents correctly. The compilation of music on this CD represents some of the most popular music of the people south of the U.S. border. I enjoy listening to it.
4,Excellant overview of Coastal Georgia and it's isles people!,This book is an excellant source of research for someone who enjoys historical reading about the golden isles of Georgia. Not many facts and tales are missing from this book! Excellant reading
5,an awesome jazz album,This accessable jazz album contains great original pieces and very enjoyable takes on old tunes. It could be appreciated by just about any music lover. Provides great background music while cooking and my little children really groove to the great horn!
3,"Good, but in desperate need of editing!!","The overall material of this book is good and inforative. However, the anecdotes and first person accounts repeat over and over again in various bits and pieces in such a way that you're left with a constant feeling of deja vu as you make your way through the book. You're always thinking, ""Have I already read this??"" Im lead to wonder how this book was put together....was is pieced together from a series of articles?...is it regurgitated material from an earlier book?..that might make more sense. In any case you'll need a bookmark."
1,Disappointing waste of money,"She reminds me of Amy Dascyzyn...the Frugal Zealot...Amy is a ""Frugal Snob""...this chick is a ""Gypsy Snob""...In her own words..""I was at the Country Club the other day, and shocked to discover a friend's daughter had lived in her car for a few months..."" This book is for people who do this for kicks...you know, something to shock your friends with at the Country Club, or rather than jetting off to wherever...Not for the Rainbow Family, back-to-the-land types."
1,"The show is great, but paramount sucks!!!!","how the hell it is possible that this great show does not have a choice of subtitles or languages? Paramount is the only study that does not add to their shows these options, I remind you gentlemen, that in the United States, the second most spoken language is Spanish, followed by French, Thai, Korean, Portuguese and so on. So, what is your excuse?. In an increasingly globalized world Paramount shows an incredible xenophobia, and definitely disturbing. I love this show, and I speak and understand English, however i will not buy it, and I recommend anyone who does not have English as their mother tongue do not buy it. Enough to discrimination against non-English speakers."
4,The Conch Bearer : student review,"The setting of the story is in Kolkata, India. It is about a boy who works in a tea stall striving to help his mother and sister who is ill.One day an old man walks in the store and the store owner yells and insults him to leave, But Arnand shows remorse and gives the man some tea and food. Seeing the compassion in Arnads heart the old man follows him home, and invites him to go on a journey with him to return the magical conch.With this man he goes on a journey across the Himalayas to bring the ""conch to safety."" During his journey Arnad gets tested on his courage, honesty and loyalty. In the end when he reaches the Silver Valley he is asked which of these virtues he believes is most important. If he chooses the right one he can become a member of the brotherhood, but the wrong choice and he goes back home.The purpose of this story is to teach people about courage and making choices for yourself. I think this was a well written story and I really enjoyed it."
5,Wonderful Read Aloud Book,I just finished reading this book aloud to my fourth grade class - they loved it and voted to give it five stars (the highest rating!). The author's descriptive language and ability to breathe life into her characters in this fantasy set in India make it a terrific read aloud - my students fought to get my copy of it to read again to themselves!
4,Protecting the conch,"The conch is no ordinary shell. It posses powers beyond explanation, powers of magic, and the essence of the powers of all who posses any sort of these powers. So now you might have some idea of what it is like to embark on a journey to save the conch, and defeat an evil war lord who was chaseing you from the start of your quest. This is how Anand felt in the novel ""The Conch Bearer."" Since his father disapeared Anand must make the family's money but when an old man shows up and cures his sick sister, Anand knows he must leave and join up with the magician. Anand finds himself on a mission to take take the magic object to the brotherhood, and orginization of magic to help those in need. He is acompanied by an old magician and a poor sweeper girl. I recomend this book to anyone who likes a magic adventor, and a battle between good and evil. This is novle of betrail and friendships. Of choices good and bad, all leading up to a final and hardest choice of all..."
5,A Delightful Tale of Self Discovery!,"The Conch Bearer, much like The Mistress of Spices, takes you on an absolutely delightful journey, with the right mix of supernatural and human elements. If you want a book to ""take you to another place"" for awhile, this is it!"
4,Great Read!!,"This book is a fresh, funny joyride that will have you laughing and thinking through the entire book. The situations that Chevy, Noah, Geneva and Crystal get themselves into are wild. Thank you Ms. McFadden for another wonderful and entertaining book.P.S. You don't have to read Groove, the 1st book, in order to enjoy this one, but you should."
4,Not hot enough for fever but a slight temperature,"Easy and quick read.Overall, an enjoyable book.I wouldnt exactly say steamy but certain parts might be considered ""hot"""
3,Looking for something more...,"Don't get me wrong, this was a good book... but I guess I was looking for something a little more... well... steamy! Could be my own warped mind but I wanted the characters to get a LOT more freaky. This book certaintly had characters that I loved, hated, and loved to hate! 3 stars is a little low, and four stars is a little high, so I give it a 3.7."
5,Some of the best manga ever1,"As with all previous volumes of the Blade of the Immortal series, this is an excellent piece of work; superb art, complex story, wonderfully detailed characters.Detailed in this volume are Rin's travels -- hard and frustrating, without Manji at her side -- to find Anotsu. Anotsu ascends to take over a remote dojo, but finds himself in a sticky situation when the current master has a request: that he take his daughter as a wife when he takes over the dojo! And of course... Manji mends from his near-fatal (even for the immortal) fight with three of the Itto-Ryu, and discovers that his attempt to get a pass has failed, and that he has a new ally he never expected...If you're a BotI fan, you can't justify NOT buying this volume! Too much important storyline comes to light here; Manji's limitations, the secrets of the Mugen-Ryu, and the Itto-Ryu's goals... This and more!"
4,Why this book is good,"1. The art is simply fantastic. I have never seen an artist able to express feelings or raw emotion or draw an action sequence of a fight so well. If you are one who appreciates art, or pencil art for that matter, Hiroaki Samura is one which you should look at.2. The fantastic storyline. In ""Secrets"", which is the 10th book of the Blade of the Immortal series, the plots starts to thicken. Most of the characters have been introduced by now, if you have been following the series, and the story is only going to get darker.3. This would be a good reason to get the 11th book, Blade of the immortal: beasts."
4,great buy,"Came in timely manner, product was in great condition as described, fairly priced. I would buy from this seller again"
1,"This is a severely flawed, unfinished program.","The GRE Powerprep software is a good idea- however, the program is severely flawed. The program lacks a scroll bar, making it impossible to read entire pages of information. While there is data beyond the presented screen, the program does not provide a way to access it. For example- while answering a reading comprehension section, the user will not be able to read the entire section, but rather, will only see what fits into a half-screen window. Anything not included on the screen is inaccessible. Also, some questions are blank, with only choices given. It's hard to pick the right answer when you don't know the question! Don't waste your money until ETS completes the program or provides a patch."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"Pahlease, do yourself a favor and go to the GRE website. You can DOWNLOAD this software for free. I think even if you are not signed up for a test, you can download it -- but I may be wrong there, you might have to sign up for a test. Check it out. But don't waste your money buying this -- try the practice test they offer FREE from their website first."
1,YIKES!!!1,The worst PPV from the WWF I have ever seen. how it got an average rating of 4 and a half stars is beyond me. But Fully Loaded 1999
2,BORE SCORES AND HOPEFULLY 7 YEARS AGO,"BORIN ! BORING ! ONLY THE AUSTIN , ROCK FIGHT IS WORTH THIS EVENT.IF U WANT TO SEE SHAMROCK KICK UNDERTAKE5R'S LEG FOR 20 MIN. THEN THAT'S KOOL.IF U WANTTA SEE TRIPLE H'S ARM AROUND X-PACS NECK FOR 15 MIN. KOOL.IF U LIKE THAT BUY IT. IF U DON'T , IF U BUY U R WASTING A GOOD 20 BUCKS."
4,pretty good,I rented this tape and really want to buy it soon. I thought every match was good. Every person who said this was not good and only worht renting was wrong. I listened to them though and they were wrong it was pretty solid. The rock austin and the hardcore match between al snow and hardcore holly was good. The boiler room brawl was exactly wat it says a great brawl. It really brought out the best in both of them. You should buy this know.
4,above average,this had several good matches like mankind/bigshow.the best match was rock/austin. the hardcore match was okay as well. shamrock/undertaker was really boring and long. hhh/xpac was the second best match. the rest were average. i wouldnt buy it but i would rent it.
3,WHY DID STONE COLD BEAT THE ROCK.,FROM WRESTLEMANIA 15 YOU WOULD THINK THE ROCK AND STONE COLD BOUNT WAS OVER. BUT YOU KNOW THIS MATCH WAS BETTER THEN WRESTLEMANIA.THE FUNNY THING THAT HAPPEN WAS THE ROCK HOLDING A CAMERA OVER STONE COLD WHILE TRASH TALKNG.I THINK BACKLASH WAS A GOOD SHOW. BUT THE UNERTAKER VS KEN SHAMROCK MATCH WAS BORING. PS WATCH TRIPLE H MAKE A NAME FOR HIM SELF ON THIS CARD IYH.
2,an ok ppv,"It was an OK PPV at best. The best match was probably the Boiler Room Brawl. The title match was good. I read the other reviews for it though, and someone said that The Rock vs. Stone Cold was the best title match in history. I've been watching wrestling for over 15 years, and I don't think The Rock and Stone Cold could even go down as one of the top 10 WWF Championship matches of all time. As usual, another mediocre PPV by the WWF."
3,This Event is not very good,I think it is sad when they have a rematch of the same card as Wrestlemania. The undercard was decent but its nothing better than what you would see on Warzone. The boiler room brawl is really ridiculous I don't think its near as good as the one at SummerSlam 96. Even the concept of having the main event a no-DQ makes it exactly like Wrestlemania XV. Besides the Rock should have won Austin is the worst wrestler of all time.
3,It was okay for an in your house,"Its wasnt bad, it wasnt good the Stone Cold vs the rock was good but the boiler room match mankind vs the big show sucked and ken shamrock and the undertaker was cool. Undertaker rules! My friend nick said it was good but it was just okay."
5,WWF Backlash 1999 review,"This was much better then their lackluster Wrestlemania(15). The best matches were The Boiler Room Brawl between The Big Show & Mankind which was a great reminder of the Japanese hardcore mathces & The main event bout for the WWF championship between The Rock & Stone Cold Steve Austin which was better then their bout at WM15 and had enough imagination into it. The worst matches were the Intercontinental championship match between Goldust & The Godfather which was lame & dumb and the Undertaker-Ken Shamrock match which was a ""Unbearably boring,18 minute-plus submission hold extravaganza"" or as the Nostalgia Critic would call it a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". The Hardcore championship brawl between Al Snow & Hardcore Holly was a good reminder of ECW in the 90's. The rest were ok. I give this event a 9 out of 10."
5,GREAT True Crime!,"This is one of the best true crime books I've read...and I've read a lot.Really gets into the heads of the victims and the perps. Good psychological study of ""why"" some people behave the way they do. Very insightful."
5,"Simply outstanding in research, writing and true-story telling","Franscell does a masterful job of recounting the tragic crimes in his hometown, Casper, Wyoming. His writing is superb."
5,The Truth About Weight Tables,"I learned the truth about both Weight Tables and Diets, as well as the importance of Nutrition and Exercise. In this book, Dr Glaesser explains the historical context of the American Weight Tables and their formation by Met Life Insurance Company. His extensive research has shown that people with higher weights can be fit and sometimes even fitter than the ones that actually fit into the prescribed weight tables. For me this is a startling finding. I am relieved to learn that Glaesser recommends allowing our bodies to equilibrate around our natural set point rather than yo-yo dieting to try to attain a weight that we have been taught is optimal. In depth discussions of good vs bad types of body fat are also informative and further make Big Fat Lies a good and instructive read."
4,Good,This book could be very enlightening to some people although an academic understanding of exercise physiology might be helpful for the average reader. Does an excellent job of shedding light on the counterpoints to calorie restriction.
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I THINK THIS DOCTOR THOUGHT HE WAS WRITING WAR&PEACE; AND IT IS AS HEAVY GOINGBUY DAVID GILLESPIES BIG FAT LIES IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
1,Crap book fosters fat complacency,"I thought this book would give some insight as to why people gain weight ie chemicals in food, intolerances, body to acidic due to ...etc. Instead it rambled on and on about how its ok to be fat."
2,ONE GLARING WEAKNESS ONLY,"I love photo vests, I own several. This one is extremely high quality, I won't get into that. I just want to point that they over-designed the zipper with a double zipper that opens at the bottom every time i sit down. That would be no real big deal, maybe I needed the extra room or something, but when you go to take it off, the open bottom part of the zipper behaves like a broken zipper-hard to get apart. This is a real deal breaker in an otherwise great vest, the best I've seen. It also runs a little small. I always get a 2X which usually is great for wearing over a sweater for me, but this one runs tight in the stomach, which accentuates the double-zipper opening spontaneously at the bottom problem."
3,Average trad regency,Well written but the plot was a bit boring..too many misunderstandings on the heroine's part..not enough going on in the hero's characterization. I have read much better books by Patricia Olivier. Not a keeper
4,best knives in the swiss army stock,...but needs an screw driver in it i completly agree with other reivew get ride of wine opener.. thats why i picked 4 stars { awsome knive.} i got when i was 13 and still got it
5,this is my 3rd I lost the first two in house moves,I love these things they work and stay nice and clean looking. I always have one around.I like how it opens and closes so easily.
5,GREAT KNIFE,"I GAVE IT TO MY FIANCE FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVED IT. IT IS OF GREAT QUALITY AND IS VERY NICE. HE USES IT FOR MANY THINGS, THE PRICE WAS GOOD AND DELIVERY FAST. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY GIRL WANTING TO BUY A PRESENT FOR HER MAN THAT HE WOULD LIKE, AND USE."
5,Got what I ordered,Got this for my brother's birthday and he loves it! This is what he wanted and he's happy he got it.
5,Excellent,This is the way to go if you are looking for something that can handle everyday tasks and go off into the woods. I am going to buy another just in case I lose this great tool.
4,A little much,"For me, i don't use this product much, when i do it is very handy though. If you don't go on regular hiking trips, this might not be the product for you, with millions of useless gadgets. If you are the outdoorsy type, however, this would be on the top of my list for you, the best multi-tool out there in my opinion!"
3,Suave Leading Man of the 1930's and 1940's,"""The Robert Montgomery Collection"" pays tribute to a popular leading man of the 1930's and 1940's. Though his light these days doesn't shine as brightly as that of his M-G-M contemporaries Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, Montgomery projected a debonair charm and seemed most at home in light comedies, though he turned in a chilling performance as a suspected murderer in 1939's ""Night Must Fall.""His leading ladies included Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell, Ingrid Bergman, Susan Hayward, and Carole Lombard.This four-disc collection contains eight features including ""Shipmates"" (as naval hero John Paul Jones), ""Faithless"" (co-starring Tallulah Bankhead), ""Lovers Courageous"" (as English family black sheep and world traveler), and ""Made on Broadway"" (as a slick, fast-talking press agent).Also included are ""The Man in Possession,"" ""But the Flesh Is Weak,"" ""Live, Love and Learn,"" and ""The Earl of Chicago."" There are no bonus extras."
1,what the hell is this...,"Dan Swano was a great musician back with Edge of Sanity and I mean this being an Edge of Sanity fan since Purgatory Afterglow. Now look at Dan Swano, his one man project sounds like a cross between Edge of Sanity and Amorphis' Tales from the Thousand Lakes (Tales...sounds much better then this ...). Come on Dan, I know you can do a lot better then this...And by the way, the keyboards in this production don't match the atmosphere (the death metal vocals I mean) and another thing the guitars are weak, very weak. They're not catchy, they just float in the back, I don't know what to do with Dan Swano anymore...he's really ... around these days, that goes for his Nightingale band.Dan Swano should just re-form EOS again and finish what he left off (meaning his career)."
4,A different take on melodic heavy metal,"Its a shame that when someone says 'melodic-death' its easy to think of a particular sound. Its a name associated with the likes of early Soilwork, Arch Enemy and At The Gates for its thrashier side and In Flames, Dark Tranquility and to a lesser extent early Opeth for its more epic sound. I say its a shame because the genre has somewhat stagnated with too many bands doing the same thing and it seems that melodic yet extreme metal albums that break these moulds get ignored for being less accessible instead of being praised for treading new grounds. One of these albums is Dan Swano's Moontower.Combining melodic riffs, growled vocals and heavy synth sounds, it kinda sounds like a melodeath version of Rush. Its catchy and melodic but also different. If you have a problem with synths then it may not be the album for you, but those with an open mind to different sounds should like Moontower."
5,Possibly my new favorite album,"It's not very often that I question my favorite albums, but Dan Swano's Moontower may just be my new favorite. Everything about this album is amazing the vocals, the drums, guitars, bass everything. the only the flaw I could find the thing is that it would have been nice if it were longer and the keyboards in the 5th song just make it seem like a joke. After listining to most of Edge of Sanity and some of Nightingale and a couple of Swano's other projects I can say without a doubt that this is his best work. I give my highest recommendation to this for anyone into Swano's other projects or anyone into melodic death in general."
3,Check out Winning in the New York Small Claims Courts,"The definitive guide seems to be ""Winning in the New York Small Claims Courts, a Simple, Step-by-Step Guide for Everyone"" if you plan on being in the New York State Courts. The author teaches at the Learning Annex and is quite dynamic."
3,People's Court,"Ignore my rating because I did not read the book, I thought a fair rating wouldn't tip the scales too much. In any case, I came to check it out because of the writer (Rothstein) appearing on People's Court. He did win in spite of himself and lack of preparation. What an odd character he is with the bowtie and mannerisms!"
5,A complete guide for success within small claims court,"I highly recommend Dr. Ted Rothstein's book, ""Small Claims Court - Step-by-Step"". This book is very well organized and complete. The common sense approach to such legal matters builds confidence. Don't consider small claims court without it!"
3,Root touchup between colorings,"It is fairly easy to use, but it is a poor substitute for getting the roots colored professionally. It does help when one is on an extended trip and cannot get to the beauty parlor."
3,"If you part your hair, fine for that.",I used it on parted hair that needed a touch up and it was fine. Be careful not to color your scalp. Dampen slightly. Don't use too wet. I only gave it three stars because it really took a while to color the roots.
1,Do not buy it,"It just does not work, it does not color the gray hair, it seems to be too dry, it would have to be a little creamier."
2,My 3 year old son blocked is nose when I walk,"Well the product work good as it covered my gray. I don't like that it's sticky and doesn't feel nice but that would'nt of stop me from buying it. The reason I won't put it in, is because it's smell awfull. I smelled it and was wondering if someone else would. Everytime my 3 year old son came to see me, he told me that something smelled bad and pinch is nose. He always says I smell good...that whas enough for me to know that I'd rather have gray roots then smell like that. If anyone foudn a better product leave me a message."
2,not a fan,I'm not a fan. You have to significantly wet it to get it on your hair so your hair either has to be wet when you do this or else it appears like a greasy strip on dry hair. Also not easy to get the color to coverup my gray-maybe good if you have like only two gray hairs but not a lot of gray roots like myself.
2,Not so good,"The touch up stick does not really do a great job. My hair color is dark brown, however the stick gave me a lighter color that was noticeable. Besides, the part of the hair that you paint gets a very dull color. It might work for other people, but I did not like the results that I got."
1,Colors somewhat but contains a stench,"A completely unnecessary and strong stench: perfume I guess is what some people call it. I have seen estimates that as many as a quarter of the population is sensitive to these scents; some know it and some don't realize what is causing their sneezing, coughing, choking, watering eyes, headaches, feelings of malaise, difficulty breathing (!) etc. So why put scent in a product that is supposed to color hair? I didn't see it listed as an ingredient on the package; otherwise I would not have spent my money on it. Only when I used it and had to ride in a closed vehicle with someone else who is very sensitive to this allergen, did I realize the strong unwelcome addition to something that was supposed to cover the gray, not somehow change my odor.I THINK it does work to color the wisps of white hair I'm getting. But of course now I can't use it again. I suggest looking elsewhere for a product that won't make people sick."
4,Covers the gray!,"Takes a little bit to get used to, but does the trick between hair coloring (or when you just feel like you are coloring your hair too often)."
3,Fat eyebrow pencil,"You wet it and rub it on. It will also color your scalp, if you are not careful, tho it rubs right off. That's another thing. If you are going to be out all day, you will need to reapply it. Cheap, quick fix, and better than nothing, but don't expect fantastic results. It will look greasy if you overdo it. Also, I bought dark brown and it's not dark enough. My hair is not the darkest brown I've seen, either. Note that you will need to wash it out before you do color your roots, or the color won't take well. So, this is a cool emergency measure, imo, not an everyday-use thing. But for those times when you are going somewhere and don't have the time for a touch-up -- excellent! I'm going to look around, tho, in case there is a better item out there."
3,Roux stick works for a temp. fix,"The Roux stick is only a temp. fix. It is not the easiest cover up for gray hair due to the thick, crayon like texture.Wet it first with warm water, pull the hair away from the face, and rub on from scalp out. It will come off easily if you get it on your skin. It is preferable to the mascara like cover ups which get tangled in longer hair. There are powder forms of touch ups which I have not used, but will try in the future. Hope this was helpful."
4,Roux is not FAUX!,"This product really does what it says! I have used it daily since purchasing it and it's perfect for extending the life of my hair color. I need it for the stray grays around my hair line. I don't care how often I color that hair, the gray returns so quickly, while the other gray in my hair will remain colored for weeks. I hate the three-color-hair look, natural color, gray and the color from the bottle! This product allows me to have a consistent look until it's time to have my hair re-colored. It's conveniently packaged so you can carry it and touch-up anytime, no mess at all. It doesn't run when I perspire and that's important to me because I pespire quite a bit and I was concerned that I might get streaks of color running down my face! Not at all! It does have a fragrance, but nothing obnoxious. Also, I love that it's shaped like a lipstick. I'm very pleased!"
3,"SO,SO.","I had bought this but to me it doesn't work very good. So I'm back to coloring my hair, yuck! But it smells good.."
4,Works but it feels odd on your hair,"I have to say I haven't colored my hair since I've purchased this product in over 4 months. It does the trick in hiding the gray coming out of the root line but the feel of it on my hair is odd. It feels dull like you've got crayons on your hair. If I use it very sparingly and lightly, it seems better. Overall, it is ok, but could be better. I wish they would create a wide marker similar to a sharpie that was safe for hair. Honestly, I've used black sharpies in a bind and I like it much better than this product but I'm afraid it will damage my hair. Any thoughts?"
4,Does the trick,"Bought after reading the reviews. It works good for those stubborn grays that pop up before your next haircut along the temple and earline area. Little messy, but not bad. Does the job."
1,uugly,it looked like shoe leather paste. i threw it away. not happy with product or color of product. and why am i forced to write so many words?
4,I like it,I love it. Very convenience. It is health for using it. I have bought different colors just in case. good.
1,Smells bad!!!,"The product works okay, but it smells so bad that you can't use it. It isn't just you that will notice the smell--other people notice it too."
2,Too greasy,"Bought this with high expectations, but it proved to be a big disappoitment. It's basically a dark greasy lipstick you are putting on your hair. After application It looks like you haven't washed your hair for 2 weeks. May be OK if you have one tiny area to touch up( around ears let's say), but if you have salt and pepper type of hair, it will look really greasy. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great for touch ups,"This is a great product to use for touch up between colorings. If too much is applied, hair can feel waxy. A little bit goes a long way. I friend told me about this product, and I wish I had learned of it long ago."
3,"Good coverage, but hard to work with","I have extremely dark hair so the few greys that I have are easily spotted. I wanted something to cover here and there where needed. This product covers grey hairs, but it is difficult to work with. I have tried wetting the stick, warming it up a bit...and that helps, but it is still difficult to get it to go onto my hair. The texture is also too heavy for me as I have very fine hair that is weighted down easy...and it is a bit sticky. Overall, I wouldn't purchase this again, however maybe it would be ok for someone with thick hair."
1,I hate giving a bad review but this stuff is awful. Hard as a rock.,I have tried many touch-ups and scalp cover-ups. I have thinning hair and color my hair so these products are a necessity. I saw this and it is similar looking to a product Michael diCesare had that was a lipstick for your hair. It was a great product but i can no longer find it so i purchased this product because it looks like the other but the Roux was so hard you can't even get it on your hair or scalp. It is a hard brown stick that does nothing.Do not waste your money trying this product. It is worthless and useless.
1,"Roux Tween Time Hair Crayon, Dark Brown",This stuff is a joke. It's like a hard peice of charlk. I couldn't even get the stuff to go on my hair. Save your money.
1,Too hard!,"I purchased this stick (along with another brand) at a Sally Beauty Supply. It was fine for a couple of weeks, but then it got so hard that even wetting it did not work. It won't get wet. Maybe you have to soak it or something, but I typically don't have that kind of time. It actually hurt my head when I tried to rub it on and, even then, I could not get it to put color onto my hair. I threw it away and will not get another. I *will* continue to get the other (which works pretty well, was easy to use, and was consistent use after use)."
2,Does not help at all,"Tried using it on my hair and the color does not stick on the hair easily. The crayon is dry and though I rubbed it against my hair repeatedly, the color still didn't cover the white hair strands."
1,These covers reap holes right away!,We have purchased two pairs of these seat covers and both of the ones we use the most (on the driver side of each car) have holes in the seam already. The pair we bought awhile back were added to my car last month and the pair I got for my boyfriend only last week both have significant holes and we're very disappointed.
2,What is it?,"I ordered this to match another seat cover. Same manufacturer, same product number, and same box. The one I had looks and feels like sheepskin. This one looks and feels like a dog pelt. Could be a Chinese raccoon dog."
2,Not very Luxiourious feeling...,"I bought this to replace an older seat cover that finally tore and was shredding piece by piece (I have had it in my car since 1991).Though this fits snug on my VW bucket seat, the feeling of the sheepskin is not as soft and subtle as the older, original sheepskin covers were.It almost feels fake...which I am thinking it is.For the cost, it is not worth the cover."
2,not much sheepskin in this seatcover,"Genuine Sheepskin Bucket Seatcover, Silverthis is the title of this product. It does have SOME sheepskin in it. just down the middle. The description does admit to this. The strip of sheepskin is pretty narrow and unless you have a tiny hiney you will encounter an unpleasant seam where the good stuff meets the crummy stuff. The fake sheep skin is loose and stretchy and slides around when you get into the carthe over all fit is okay and the cover looks nice at a glance but the union of the real and the fake is not good. The seam is lumpy and uncomfortable.I returned mine. For the money, you should just shell out a little more and get a all sheep skin cover"
2,Not much sheep?,"Genuine Sheepskin Bucket SeatcoverMisleading Ad...The part that is Sheepskin is indeed genuine sheepskin.....and without full examination ...who would know...??? accept.. now you do!! The only part of the seatcover that is entirely made of sheepskin (PELTS) and that is the operative word (PELTS)....is the center of the seatcover approx. 12"" by 30"" or so, give or take. The rest is NOT made of sheepskin (PELTS)....but it is made of a woven material to look like sheepskin that I am sure will not wear very well, thus will not last as if it were made entirely of sheepskin Pelts....especially the bottom portion where you are actually sitting on and and sliding in and out of the vehicle .....I know this from experience all of my other cars seatcovers are made this way the entire seat andseat back excluding sides of seat and the actual back of seat where it does'nt matter are made in this fashion it makes a differance....!!!!"
2,False advertising in description of product,"The product description clearly states the seat covers are made of lambs wool, which is what I wanted. When they arrived I find that ONLY THE CENTER PANEL of the seat is lambs wool, while the rest is made of imitation material. FALSE ADVERTISING in your product description. This has made me quite tentative about buying other products (outside of books or DVDs) from Amazon."
2,not what I expected,"Maybe I should have known by the price, but I was surprised to find out that just the center panel of fur is sheepskin. All of the surrounding fur is fake (ie polyester or something) and it definitely feels like it. I returned the two that I bought, since I wanted something with more sheepskin."
3,did not fit!,"I had ordered 2 and they did not fit! The quality of the covers are nice, but not made for seats that have electronic controls at the base/side or high adjustable buckets. I returned them and still have not received my refund from Amazon."
2,Sewed seams don't last,"It has been a year now since I got a set of these seat covers for Christmas 2010 and installed them on a 2007 PT Cruiser. Now where the center seat strip and the polyester sided pieces are sown together the stitching is now ripping out because of sliding in and out of the vehicle - and I a skinny less then 200Lb person and drive less then 5,000 miles a year. Be advised."
4,American Standard best of the line,"American Standard bowl has clean bowl wash. Its design is appealing. Shipment of item was lessthan caring. Foundation within the carton was not substantial to prevent minor damage to intakeconnection. Installation was completed after dealing with the slight damage. I would still usethe company, I wish they would reevaluate their packing process and procedure to prevent any damage to the product."
4,"Drago Menacing As Ever in ""Convict""","Actor Billy Drago (Deadly Heros, Freeway) has been making movies since the 80's. He is type-casted as a subtle psychotic killer with unique behaviors that he has made his signature. For fans, he is a guaranteed good time in the bizarre behavior department. He remains true to his craft in ""Convict 762"". The movie has good casting, Frank Zagarino (Never Say Die) and Shannon Sturges (Tornado!), who use their air time well in this deadly game of cat-and-mouse. There's good action in this low-budget sci-fi thriller and it keeps the viewer entertained and wondering what's what. This movie is worth the time and a must have for Mr. Drago fans and sci-fi lovers."
5,Stanton Moore sticks really good!,Great lightweight stick that has the chunk to really smash through the cymbals when you need it but light enough to play with finesse as well. The arrow tip creates volume on the snare and a beautiful cymbal sound. Great stick!
3,Give it to your beloved mother,"You became a tanguero. You became hooked on D'Arienzo, Di Sarli, Pugliese, you teach (unexperienced) dancers that Piazzolla is not the one, you drive five hours away to dance three hours and than you return home. Fine. Now you bought CD Tango Argentino and you don't know what to do with it. Here is my advise: give it as a gift to your mom, whom you love. She will become owner of a beautiful music, well recorded, actually ""tango for non-tangueros"", The Tango for Export. The songs that you can't listen to because they are too commercial. Still - tango argentino, original and clean. Not ""raw"" enough for you."
5,great!!!,"i got two sets of this clamps already. they work great with the bed of my f150 supercrew short bed and the bakflip cover i have on it. it gives now 4 high points that i can move to one side or another to secure cargo, and so far, this clamps really grab it good. cant believe that my truck came without stake pockets on it... (well, they are there, but the plastic thing on top is not cut out) ... actually if i use to much force in the tie downs going to this clamps, looks to me like the bed rail is the one that is going end bending, long before the clamp will start moving or something like that. great product."
5,Leonard Powers,"I installed a toolbox on my pick-up, the toolbox covered the front tiedown positions. I did not want to drill any holes in the truck and the rear tiedowns did not allow for secure strapping of anything. the bully clamps work great and can be adjusted along the truck sides for very secure tiedowns reguardless of the load!"
2,Bizarre illustrations,"As in my review for the other book in this series, unfortunately the illustrations are bizarre. They remind me of a public health brochure. They just don't seem to match the style of the story. It was a disappointment."
2,try harder,"the title of this book makes it sound like this book was going to have great promise. it deals more with giles and jenny than it does with the main characters of the show. buffy is even thrown in a couple of times but is mostly forgotten. willow and xander virtually don't exist. this book is like it was written by giles as a slap in the face that he doesn't get enough credit or something. every once in a while they will throw in angel for a brief moment or two. when they put on the title that this is volume one, i shudder to think what the rest of the books are going to be like. i can save those who have not bought the book some time and say don't bother."
2,How I Survived Reading this Book,"It's a Buffy the Vampire Slayer tie-in book. And the first one I've read. I don't know how it compares to the others, but it was a rather interesting experience. I counted one mention of Cordelia in the entire book - I thought she'd deserve more mention than that?The book is made up of six short stories, and the first story confounded me at first, but as it went on, it seemed to have a storyline that was present, but by the fifth story it had disappeared.I, on a whole, would not recommend this book unless you are a die-hard Buffy fan that has to read the novels too. I think I'll just stick to the tv show from now on, unless I get really bored."
4,A Pioneer's Search For an Ideal Home,"I was born and raised in the Grays Harbor Area of Washinton State. I recieved this book from my Mother but I was not really interested. As I read this book I quicly changed my mind. This book brings two things to its readers; a great insite to the life and trials of our ancestors while trying to find an Ideal Home, and it alows you to feel their the love of God. Great book."
5,it a good drama movie that talk of what's possible go wrong in the family for money,"the story line in this movie is about a parents that thought that they have educated their sons in a respectful manner but it turned out none of that is true.so the act of their actions start showning soon after,when their parents go into retirement and they are about to receive a large sum of money ,and that is when everything start going in the wrong direction when the envy,grief,jeoulousy and all the brothers wild signs start showing off in a big scale that they can't no longer control. this movie scenario is base in the 1990's and with good menssage of what is it that we should not be doing against your parents."
1,"The kind of fiction that makes you flinch, it's so bad.",Every Christian fiction starts with some: Why would God? question. This one starts with: Why would God let an old woman have a scary dream. I really don't think I need say any more. Out of all the why would God question I've ever heard; I have never ever heard worse.
5,A great man lives on,Thanks to Robert K. Dearment a little recognised brave Lawman comes to life. George Scarborough was my Grandmothers uncle and as an expat American with little knowledge of my family this book has been a wonderful experience and a great help to me.Robert Dearment explains life and times in New Mexico and surrounding areas in such a way that you are transported back to that time. Many of the incidents which are only alluded to other Wild West biographies and stories have been investigatedand researched and written about in detail. As there are always two sides to every story both explanations are given in an unbiased way.Anyone who is interested in Frontier and Wild West should make sure that they have a copy of this book in their library. The book also explains and tidies up loose ends on other stories which have done the rounds over the years.
1,OOps wrong lothlorien,"The name Lothlorien from 'Lord of the Rings' conjures up images of a magical elven forest where beauty, sensitivity, space, protection and light are present. If this is what you're after try Australia's 7 piece band Lothlorien with celtic harp, uillean pipes, whistles, etc. Those who enjoy thrash may not polarize the styles and argue that there is still subtlty etc within the music and vocal style and with this in mind one may give it 5*****, with past critique in mind. An old age debate between light and dark. No doubt there is great beauty within the shadows, and this illustration has been made through the band title like the balance of yin and yang to the ears, but I try to concern myself with the source of light. Thanks for including MP3's."
4,Battleship Gneisenau,"A small book which deals with the Battlecruiser Gneisenau. This was probably the least successful of the battleship/battlecruiser's in Hitler's fleet, having been laid down in 1935 and removed from service in 1942. It was planned to lengthen the ship and change the gun caliber to 380cm, but when Hitler decided to concentrate on U-boats, the ship was left in non-repair, with the remaining main guns removed to Norway and the ship left in disrepair. When the Russians neared the area of Danzig/Gotenhafen, the ship was taken to the mouth of the harbor and sunk as a block ship. I purchased the book to see if it gave any information on what happened to the ship after it was bombed by British and towed east to repair it. I was especially interested in what the ship looked like and what happened to it, and the the book covers this in a few pictures, which is OK, but needs moreto cover it more fully."
2,Disappointed,"I bought three of these filters because I reasoned that it was less wasteful to thrown out one complete filter system a year than to throw out three to five regular filters that the other systems used. I hooked up the first one and it worked okay except that as others have said the flow is greatly decreased and it takes a while to fill a glass. This I could live with thinking I was being less wasteful. Unfortunately, the system gave out after only three months. According to the instructions this system is supposed to handle 300 gallons of water. My wife and I live alone and we certainly did not use the 300 gallons of filtered water in three months. In fact, we probably use less than a half gallon a day. That means the filter should have lasted six hundred days. Not even close."
1,Cheap plastic ring....it broke,It lasted one month before the ring at the top where it connects to the faucet broke. Can't fix it. I'm out the money...never buy one again.
5,Great way to go green!,"We recently decided to cut down on water bottles, but we still wanted something more than straight tap water. I installed this on my laundry room sink in less than 5 minutes. It works really well and fills up our water bottles faster than the fridge water dispenser. I highly recommend this!"
4,Good Value,"Great product! Doesn't quite last a whole year for us, but that's because we're waterholics (family of 2). It tastes great and its very cheap for what it is. Great value!"
3,Works great - can break easily,"My parents got this as a gift and have used it for 4 months and loved it... water tastes great, easy installation and use. Plastic fitting has now broken where it screws onto tap and item is unusable."
5,Excellent product,"i bought this last year, and it has worked perfectly for a year and 2 months, so longer than a years worth, and I drink Alot of water. I can't say anything bad about this product 5* from me!!"
4,So far so good,We have had this item for about a month now. My kids don't like the taste as well as our old Sparklettes delivery. My husband & I got tired of paying for it & decided to try this. We like it but they think it tastes like tap.
1,Cheap and useless,"I bought this based on great customer reviews. Alas, the product I got doesn't screw on to my tap very well and water sprays out of the top. If you increase the water pressure, the whole unit falls off. After grappling with this for an hour, I'm sending it back."
4,Great Seller,"More than the product being a good product, the seller is better. I had so many problems with Fed-ex that I didn't get the product until weeks later and there was so much drama. But the company was very nice and understanding."
4,Fantastic Filter,"I purchased this filter not knowing if there would be a significant difference in the quality of water but I thought I had nothing to lose. I also wanted to discontinue buying bottled water to help save the environment. I selected this brand based on feedback from others that use the pitcher system. After installing the filter (needed an additional adapter < $1.00) I was amazed at how different the water tasted. Before switching the lever to filter, I tasted the regular tap for comparison. After switching I could tell the difference immediately. For this low investment, I should be able to get a year's worth of fresh filtered water. This disposable filter system is less expensive than the pitcher system which requires regular filter changes that tend to be expensive. My dog also loves the new filtered water. Many thumbs up and good-bye plastic bottles."
2,Fire!,"So, I put one of these (the Butter kind) in the microwave. I watched and listened. The bag puffed up about halfway, didn't vent the steam and started to smoke, all in less than two minutes. When I took the bag out, the bottom was scorched black and a piece of the side of the bag had been blown out/burned through.I figured it was because it didn't vent, so I tried another one. This one puffed up right away and steam did vent out of the top. But still, when I took it out when the popping got slow, the bottom of the bag was burnt as were some of the kernels inside. The not-burnt ones tasted fine.I may try one more time and just stop the microwave at a little over a minute, regardless of how much it is still popping. But it looks like ""back to the drawing board"" for Pop Secret on this one."
2,"Good Music, Poor Transfer?","The selections are representative of Liberace's unique, gloriously kitschy style. Unfortunately, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired, as loud notes from the piano are often subject to peak distortion. Hard to tell whether the flaw is in the master tape or the transfer - background hiss appears to have been cleaned up nicely via No-Noise process, but some extra hiss wouldn't be as distracting as the distortions. There is no info in the liner notes about when/where these cuts were recorded, but it sounds like late 1950s or early to mid 1960s stereo."
4,Liberace plays,"Liberace was a class act. I first saw him as a child on his syndicated television show in the early 50's. To a child, as I was then, his voice was a bit strange to me, but his ability to make music appealed to me. This is an enjoyable cd, but the audio mix on some tracks was a concern to me. Literally, his theme song, I'll Be Seeing You, has a poor audio mix. His piano is on the left channel only and is low level. Since he plays the lead melody line his piano should have been more predominant. I use an audio restoration program that allows me to do many things. I loaded that track and boosted the left channel 4 decibels and now, to me, to piano is more upfront, as it should be and sounds much better. Other friends have heard my ""remix"" and agree it is an improvement. Otherwise, if you like Liberace you'll enjoy this disc. He was a consumate entertainer."
4,One of the most emblematic icons of the sixties!,"Liberace was the embodiment of the showy pianist, irreverent, the actor (He starred The Chandelles, a villain who had a twin in Batman)the spectacle per excellence, the outlaw generation. Liberace was for the piano what Warhol for painting. Las Vegas was for him his second home. And this album includes part of his live performances. He gave the easy to listen music a curious blending of classic and pop music with his well known eccentricities and mannerisms, but for better or worst was part of the sixties, with the rack pack, neon lights and psychedelic ambiance.Don't miss it."
5,Stunning set that deomonstrates his genius,"I first met Liberace in 1971 in Vancouver. We clicked immediately. I was a gay man in deep denial, he was outrageous, flamboyant and out in the open. Needless to say I fell in love, not only with the man but with his music. This CD reveals what a true Genius the man was. Let the music do the talking. After listening to this I can hold my head high and I actually feel liberated. The passion of Liberace pulses through this disc"
1,Poor Backgound Music,"This CD appears to be recorded from live concerts and contains a lot of chatter. I ordered for ""nice"" background music and easy listening, not a lot of Liberace's comments."
5,Jazztime Tale is tops!,"Several years ago I had rented this story on VHS for my third grade students, they loved the story about Fats Waller and Ruby Dees narration was captivating. When the local video store closed up I thought it was the end of Jazztime Tale for my students. I located this DVD on Amazon and am thrilled with this purchase."
1,Healthy 10 Min. Meals that take an hour.,"These meals are not really 10 minute meals. There is a lot of preparation that can take 1-2 hours. After that, then, it only takes 10 minutes to make it."
4,Great cookbook for busy cooks,This is a great cookbook for busy people. The week of meals starts out with one day where you cook the basics. It really doesn't take much time. It simplifies cooking the rest of the week so that you can make the followup meals in ten minutes. The meals taste great and are very healthy.
2,Dissapointment,"I was very dissapointed about the types of recipes that were offered. I consider myself to like most foods, but this cookbook had many dishes that the majority of people would not like. It also has several tuna dishes, yuck. I'm sending mine back ASAP."
1,DOESN'T WORK WITH REGULAR CAR DOORS,"This ramp does not work with regular car doors - car doors don't open 90 degrees, which they would need to do to accommodate this ramp.The ramp is useless unless you use it to load a dog into a hatchback type opening at the back of the vehicle. And that's assuming you want your dog to be in the cargo area, since if the dog can't get in the car by itself it can't climb over the backseat, either."
3,Doesn't work for cars without modification,"This ramp will not work for a car, it's clearly designed for a van or station wagon. The door of a sedan does not open wide enough to allow the dog to get around it. We made a bracket which fits over the storage area on the lower door. It allows the ramp to fit in at an angle so the dog can get in the car past the car door. After a bit of training he got the idea and it works fine."
2,Too steep,"I bought this for my dog who had back problems, it was way too steep and my dog had to jump about 3/4's of the way up to my bed because the measurement of the ramp on the description was incorrect. It totally defeated the purpose of my dog having to not jump. I had to go back to the stairs I had been using"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!,This is not for a tall SUV. We have a hummer and the ramp only reaches just above the hitch. We thought the dogs might still be able to go up. We tried it ONCE and the dog made it up with our help. We had to hold the ramp in place because there is no traction. There are now scrapes on the entire length of the ramp. The scrapes took all of the blue material off after one use. I wish I could send it back but it is too late now. We are now stuck with a product we can not use. This is the perfect size for a small car. THIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!
2,it has substance but no good vocals,nina sky is a weired combination of good subject matter with horrible vocales.the song about their dead friend was good but like i said they really cant sing. they can carry a tune but thats it.the production on this cd was unique and different though.but it has nothing to offer as far as singing talent.the only nail in the coffin for this album is the fact that they can't sing.but if they could this would be a 4 star album easily
3,ok CD with OK songs,"This CD is ok. It's no gangsta rap, Usher, raggea or booty shaking music and if that's what you are looking for you won't find it in this CD. But if you are looking for something mellow--then it might be worth the money.I mean these girls don't sang like Tamia, Beyonce or Whitney but they have cute chants that helps the time pass as you are driving ten hours. Also, if you like Lumidee (this is who they sound like)...The beats are head nodable (if that's a word) and keeps ya neck rolling from side to side. The only song that is danceable is ""Move Ya Body"". However, they should find a real rapper to rap because their rapping skills are horrible.P.S. I'd put this CD in my neo-soul collection because of the the jazzy aspects and mellowness."
1,The sky has fallen,"Why does every hood rat think they can sing? Where did the blues go in rhythm and blues go? Why am I listening to this? Why does Nina Sky exist? If there was a Nina Sky vodka,it would be cheap and have no flavor, much like the juices that flows from these hos. Who do I have to sleep with to get my record deal? Can someone introduce them to Chris Brown? So many questions...."
1,A Bunch of Crap,"Ok seriously, how many rappers have used that beat featured in their so called ""hit"" song??? Yea, I thought so, more than ONE. I thought to be an artist these days you have to be original and talented. Hmmm... I guess not. Anyone with half a brain would realize that this is pure crap that's just going to end up on VH1's worst songs of the century list. This CD does not even deserve a star, but amazon makes you put at least one star to make the review complete. Don't waste your money people."
5,Can Ya Feel Tha Beat?,"This album is great for anyone who loves pop, r&b, hip-hop, and other styles of music fused together. Nina Sky's voices ride lovely with the beats. You can dance to this album, chill out to this album, clean your house to this album...buy this album."
5,It's Hot!!!,"Hey EveryBody! Yeah Baby!! this is one hot CD! i got to say i was not sure about it at frist.but man i was wrong, i really like all of there songs it's a great cd to mix with. you can't go wrong with this cd. so buy it now! Ram...p.s.(shh! and plus they are as hot as there record man they are fine) :)"
5,OFF DA CHAIN,oh my gosh this cd rox totally. of course my favorite song is move ya body because i love to get up and dance. its a tight cd and if u disagree something is wrong with u. Go out and buy it.
5,Nina Sky Is Reppin For Da Latinas!!,Hey all!! Nina Sky's self titled album is off the chain!! Their voices and rhythms are so hot. This album should be purchased by all cuz they are really doing it up. They are young and gifted Latinas that are reppin for aspiring (Latina) singers such as myself. They are Truly and inspiration..So go out and get the album cuz its Crazy!!
5,NINA SKY CD,BUY THE NINA SKY CD!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S AWESOME!!! A LITTLE BIT OF EVERY MUSICAL FLAVOR YOU MIGHT HAVE
5,Come People and Listen.......,"hey people come and listen to the cd since your ears will melt with joy. the cd is crazy, when i mean crazy i mean the best, no other cd is close to it. i just keep on listening and can't stop since the songs are too good to stop.thanks for reading my review, but take my opinion on getting the cd, you will not regret it.ibrahiem"
5,Dopeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I <3 Nina Sky!!! :) The latest album ""Nina Sky"" is soooo sweetttt...All the tracks is dopeeee...I love this album!!! :)"
5,Nina Sky is SPECTACULAR!!,"Nina Sky's new Cd is great, i listen to it non-stop. i mean since i got it i couldn't stop listinig to it. I love all the songs on it, every song seems like it's telling a story you can relate to. This cd is spectacular, and out of this world. The songs go in order just right and nina sky put there heart n' souls in this album and i'm glad they did, because they have inspired me to things i want to do also. When they sing their songs i feel the emotions and happiness put in the songs they brought to the table. It's a good thing that someone new came out with somthing great because all these other women singers can learn somthing from Nina Sky. Execpt Beyonce. Thanks For reading and i hope you get the cd. you won't regret getting it!!"
5,Got to get this Cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! go NOW,"this cd is so good that words can not explain it. there are songs that get me in the heart. i am speechless when some one asks me how is that cd. i just let them hear it.well listen to me, thank me later"
1,Huh?,"I am shocked at how many people gave this cd 5 stars? Wow, do you actually know good singing when you hear it? Those that gave this cd 5 stars, obviously do not. Have you heard these girls live? OMG..... I definitely give credit where credits due but listening to the first single and to the collabo with Nore...uughhhhhhh!Thanks but I'll pass"
4,They Deserve,"This cd was a gamble. Having only heard 2 tracks and seeing Nina Sky on ""Steve Harvey's Big Time""(?), I was intrigued enough to get the cd. ""Move Ya Body"" is an infectuous dance groove, ""Turnin' Me On"" is like a part 2. The songs that really impressed me were ""U Deserve"" and ""Temperture's Rising"". These 2 songs in my oppinion put Nina Sky on the map and show they can sing. ""Temperture's Rising"" should make Beyonce say ""damn"". That song alone is classic r and b in the making. Nina Sky are more than just a dance sensation, more than a sweet sensation, more than an expose, more than cover girls. It was nice 2 hear them give a lil props 2 Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam. Nina Sky rock tha house y'all."
4,The sky's the limit.,"I remember when I first heard Move Ya Body on the radio and I was always hoping they would say who the geniuses behind the song were..Nina Sky..I was wondering who they were and now I know. They are the best new artists to come around in a long time. If you like Destiny's Child, I would say they sound quite like them in certain songs, especially Faded Memories (which happens to be one of my favorite songs from the album) How can anyone hate these girls? They just made the best dance song of the summer. Comparisons to Lumidee? Please. They are nothing like her and Lumidee is horrific. This is a great CD, I would definitely recommend it."
1,Pure CRAP at it's finest!,"Why would anyone want to spend their hard earned money on this sad excuse of an album? These broads can't sing, not even to save their souls (or lack of, as heard in this 'music'). This stuff sounds as though it only belongs in a 13 year old girls cd collection. anyone else aught to be ashamed of themselves to even think that this is 'music'."
2,One Hit Wonder Twins,"This CD is quite boring with the only good track being ""Move Ya Body"" and after a while that even starts to sound boring. The vocals are average and not bad to listen to, but the music was wack and I just couldn't put up with it anymore. They needed better material. Other than that, I can't see these girls leaving their mark behind in the music world. ""Move Ya Body"" was a hit, it's old now, time to move on."
1,This CD Sucks,"To all who want to by this CD:I went in the store to buy this CD thinking that it was going to be a great album. But, after listening to all the songs, I've decided that it really sucks. 'Move ya body' is the only good song on this album. The rest sound like the girls are trying to be soulful with their voices but they really can't sing. I highly doubt that any of the other songs that will be released to radio will make a hit. They just suck. I mean, they really can't sing and every other song starts with ""Oh ohoho ohohoh oho"" terriblly. There is no varity in the songs and they all sound pretty much the same. They need a lot of vocal traning, and they don't even come close to sounding like Patty LaBelle or anyone for that matter. They just can't sing and I regret buying this CD. On the good side, they should continue to make dance hits like 'Move ya body' where a lot of ""singing"" and ""wailing"" is not involved."
2,Poor Quality,This ring is beautiful but has very poor quality. I wore it for a week (no heavy wear and tear or anything) and TWO of the marcasite stones have fallen out. Definitely a disappointment. Will probably never order from Gem Avenue again since they lack quality. Would not recommend- don't waste your money!
3,Getting worse,"I feel like every other book in this series is decent, kind of like the Star Trek movies. This book is better than the last one but not by much. Claire McNab does have an annoying habit of ending her books rather abruptly. This one is no exception. I am tired of her ""relationships"" which have been boring since she broke up with Sybil for unrealistic reasons. The sex scenes (they don't seem loving enough to call them love scenes) are as abrupt as her endings. The mysteries really aren't very compelling & haven't been since about book 5. The other series isn't much better. I'm not sure what the deal is but the only people I care about in these books are her aunt & her cat."
1,Not worth it,"Save your money. This ""guide"" offers little more information than what is already provided in the instruction book and in the game itself (with all the help signs, etc.). Probably the only parts that could be considered useful are the walkthroughs of the 5 lands, but even the walkthroughs don't offer much in the way of strategies to consider. Plus, by now the walkthroughs are available on the internet somewhere. As mentioned above, the guide offers little/nothing in the way of good vs. evil consequences for doing certain actions. It is very disappointing to find such a lousy guide with the Prima name on it. I recommend playing the game without this guide (since it doesn't really guide you at all), and if you get stuck then find some help on the internet."
2,Nothing you can't find on the net,"This isn't a very good strategy guide. There is not enough material on training your creature, which is unfortunate, since your creature is one of the more important, not to mention COMPLEX, aspects of the game. Also, the section on miracles is very vague. The only thing that kept me from rating only one star is that the actual walkthroughs for the various mini quests are useful. This is more of a walkthrough guide than a strategy guide, and with a game like B & W, the fun is in playing it, not completing it"
2,get the gamespot guide instead,"the only parts of this guide i found useful were the starting statistics for the creatures, and a few of the harder silver scroll solutions.the stats on wood value of species of trees was interesting too, but doesn't make a practical difference in actual play, since it is a waste of time to rely on trees for wood in B&W;."
3,Book by a programmer of the Game offers some Insights,"This book was actually writen by one of the programmers of Black & White. I offers some hints (read: clues) as one might expect, but because of the nature of the game, they can't be very specific. Instead, it has processes and general ideas of behavior. Fun Fun. I'd try to learn the game myself before buying this though..."
4,Helps you out when your stuck in the game!,"There are a TON of challenges in the game of Black and White that will help you out a lot. I often got stuck on these, but this strategy guide helped me figure out how to solve the challenges and tells me what to expect later in the game!"
5,Indispensable for serious researchers,"The Introduction is very informative in and of itself, and is followed by thousands of sources predicting the End from the time of Jesus to 2000 and beyond. Amazing diversity of approaches, opinions, and calculations. Believers should consult this as well: perhaps it will give them pause."
4,Excellent,"Merleau-Ponty's other unfinished book is a remarkable work of phenomenology, with significant development's in this great thinker's work. This is an amazingly complex investigation into the nature of language itself-Merleau-Ponty juxtaposes the language of the sciences, i.e. ""the algorithm,"" with ""the language of literature,"" while he privileges the latter. There are significant aesthetic contributions to literary theory in this text-with astonishing passages on the nature of reading and the transmission of signs. Strangely enough, Merleau-Ponty is quite close to Saussure and the structuralist tradition at many points in this text-despite his explicit criticisms of structuralism in Signs. While this text is unfinished and uneven, there are still exceptional passages on language-as great as anything in Phenomenology of Perception."
5,Keisler's book,Just a quick footnote to Gilson's excellent review. Keisler's out-of-print book is available for free online at:http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html
3,Not essential but tight,"This album offers nothing new or particularly interesting for fans of Baaba's music or African music in general. However, it serves as a nice (and cheap) slice of his recent shows, a 40-minute distillation of his modern sounds: the incorporation of a soul-funk sensibility as heard on the opening track, and the ""return to the roots"" with Ernest Ranglin. All the musicians play with discipline and spirit, and ""African Woman"" stands out with its Latin American flavor."
4,Game Pad does not work,"Spent hours tryting to get the gamepad to work..It will not. Tried profiling it and everything else. There are no gamepad setup screen either. Gave up and went to the mouse. Keyboard commands did not work right either. I might add that this was on a laptop, but I don't think that should matter."
2,PC Video T Woods Pro Tour 2007,"I tried installing 3 times with latest PC, fast Pentium, disabled all anti-virus programs, lots of space, etc. Every 3rd screen approximately goes bad...e.g. half or more of picture is ""grayed"" out with no image visible...some times small parts of screen are blanked out including the club head and grip areas. In short it is not reliable and I returned to the vendor"
3,"it was a gift, I don't know if the receiver liked it or not","this was a gift for my husband, and I haven't seen him play it much or comment on it, but since he spends all his spare time on a golf course, I guess that is not surprising. Delivery was fast and efficient for this item though."
1,Does Not Work!,"We have never played the game since it freezes the computer everytime we try to run it. Customer support has provided ""fixes"", but none of them work. Good luck if you choose to purchase this."
1,Wrote product on the web site.,"I ordered the Tiger Woods 07 for PC-CD-ROM. That is what's listed on the web site and what was listed on my invoice. However, what was shipped was a PC-DVD version, which of course won't play unless you have a CD-DVD in your computer. In talking with Amazon, they don't know what the problem is. There is no listing for the CD-DVD format, actually not even on EA Sports web site. So, no one can even tell me if the thing is available for CD-ROM. Very frustrating."
3,kinda disappointing,"I own the 2004 version of the Tiger Woods, and figured it was time to upgrade. I bought this version after doing zero research, and I'm really disappointed. The graphics arent as good as the 2004 version. Ball physics are a little suspect, balls bounce the same regardless of the surface they hit. Ive seen back spin off a cart path. The game play is good, its keeping me interested, but the details are just enough off to be annoying."
2,Where's the improvement?,"It's pretty evident why this game crashed in price so quickly - it's no improvement over the 2004 version despite EA having 3 full years to give the series more gas.It looks the same, plays the same, takes away the Hawaii courses and actually seems to play a bit slower even though I have a fairly robust PC - Core2 6300 + 7600GT Overclocked + 1.5GB RAM.At $20 or less it's pretty much a disposable game, and for first time buyers you might as well take the plunge. For upgraders, you should wait, and continue to enjoy the 2004 version."
1,Mr. Samuel R Cowan,"When the DVD plays Tiger only, everything is great. I can't custom golf, play any courses with other players as the system will blank out after Tiger tees off. I've tried to start the games over but the DVD won't let me. Very disappointing. I have not loaded the other DVD's I received as of yet. Thank you for your interest."
2,Annoying & Frustrating,"I do not want to watch AI players line of the damn shots and address the ball. Nor do I want to sort through a million golfing outfits, compiled primarily of different colored polo shirts. EA spent far too much time designing dress-up aspects of the game instead of focusing more upon the playability.First, you start out as a ""Hack"" playing against friends and colleagues...as you complete matches, you gain attribute points which essentially make your player a better golfer. All is fine except for one aspect, as you progress so do your friends and colleagues, which makes the whole attribute point system almost worthless.There are annoying camera angles, such as peering through the bushes...except all you see is grass, or trees.There are bugs...sometimes I would hit the ball in a particular area, and the game would say it was an unplayable ball, even though it wasn't.Basically, I would not recommend this game...it's annoying and frustrating."
3,Good play but.......,"The versions of TW golf since 2002 have not performed well on my computers. The current game keeps quiting for no identifiable reason.A fun game, would like to be able to play it without interruption. I will need to invest some time in solving whatever the problem is."
2,"No improvement in 07, lot of missing game parts","I got TW PGA06 for a penny and enjoyed it. I jumped on version 07 hoping to get all the bell and whistles of the marketing hype of easports, especially the practice stuff. Well, there is none of that on the PC version. You have to get on e of the console version. And be careful, not all of them got all features. EAsport is very bad at documenting which feature is in which version. 07 as an improvement of 06, I would have hoped to get these features. But not, there nothing new: changed a few textures (I think they were better in 06, but that's a question of taste), more people watching you (need more processing power), new courses, and that's it. Easy money for EA. Do not buy this as an 'upgrade' of 06. There isn't anything new, except for your wallet.In addition, when you read about it in forums (EAsport included), there are numerous players who experience numerous problems. Stick to version 2006, it works great."
4,Not 2005 but good,I have used every one of the TW versions and still think 2005 is the best and probably the most complicated to use all the features.This is a good version with improved graphics and new courses. They have few fantasy courses which are generally not very realistic. Central Park comes to mind in this version. The overall complaint is that like all versions competing players are not as skillful as they should be. Also some minor glitches like seeing a graphic representation of an iron when I am hitting a 4-wood has not been corrected since the 2006 vers.Overall however the TW series from EA is the best golf simulation available. The 2007 version is worth the 40 bucks.
1,What happened?????,"I had a previous version of TW Golf (02 or 03??) and had the best time with it on a modest laptop. So, I bought '07 and expected the same....boy was I wrong. I have an above average speed laptop with a decent graphics card and the game runs like molasses in winter. The hole view doesn't even show up half the time and the game graphics in general are a joke. In addition, the players responses to shots are inaccurate. You make a putt and the players response is of disappointment. A tap in type putt requires the swing of a 50' putt?? When the putt is missed (or made) the player does this wierd back bend...thing. I'm not even sure the human body could do what they do...at least not without serious injury. Honestly...the entire game is poorly designed and almost unplayable. I am really suprised and disappointed. Seriously....are these games beta tested or just shipped out??? This will be the last EA game I purchase. Thanks for ruining computer gaming EA!"
4,Same ole Toue 7,"I read some reviews on the newer TW golf games and they don't have the ""Play Alone"" feature that I was loking for. I have the '07 CD but had to buy a new computer and I didn't have the registration number on the original. So I bought another one and other than it's not in High Def like the new computer, it works just fine!"
1,it sucks!,I was looking for a game that I could play on Windows 7. You can guess how much I like it.
3,Mr.,"The program is interesting,,, needs more instruction on how to play the game or at least a help screen or an online reference or something... I have played for three weeks and still don't know how to access half the skills of the game..."
5,Amazing LIVE Performances,"If you're a blues lover, you can't lose with this disc. My personal favorites are Clarence Gatemouth Brown getting out the fiddle for ""The Drifter,"" plus another great fiddle performance with Jay MacShann on ""Smooth Sailing,"" BB King on ""Outside Help"" and Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson on ""Backdoor Blues."" This disc features a lot of top notch talent in their prime, before the inevitable age-related decline has set in. This is especially true of BB, who lays down vicious lines on Lucille and sings with the conviction of a lion asserting dominion over his territory."
3,Scoche 2008 Silverado Dash kit,"This dash kit installs with relative ease. Very easy for the do-it yourself type. My only issue is that it doesn't fit the dash all that well. The dash kit has a gap at the top and on the right side, butt is tight on the bottom and the left side. It also is a little square versus the round and curvy dash. It really sticks out. All in all though easy to install and looks ok."
2,Another Predictable Story,"People may have enjoyed this book because of its Adventure and fantasy topic, but to me, this story was to predictable. Right from the moment I found out that Timkin and Petie (the 2 main characters) were plotting to kill the Red King, I knew that they would succeed in their quest. There wasn't even any interesting events leading up to the death of the Red King. All of that was predictable to. The authors of books have to learn to let the Antagonists win, because people are getting bored with the Protagonists always coming out on top. I for one cannot think of any book where an antagonist comes out on top, and if this doesn't change, then the book world will go into a crisis.Furthermore, the characters of this book are blunt and boring to put it blankly. They lack in detail and inner depth makes me shudder.If you like predictable endings, and when the protagonists win, then you will thoroughly enjoy this book, but if you are like me, the you will dislike it immensly."
2,Steve JoeJoe's Day Out,"The Red King by Victor Kellerher is an odd book. It deals with some whacky characters. The strangest, probably a man called Petie. He has just recently bought a slave called Timkin. It is sometimes rather frustrating reading his speaking passages because he speaks in hard to understand ridles. But I guess it just adds character to the book.It is a classic fantasy adventure with the goody and the bady, and it takes all of the predictable twists and turns, making for a rather normal ending. All in all, it is a rather predictabe book, all of which I have read before (and it smells)."
1,"The Red King, good........Nahhh","This ill-prepared and boring book is a mockery of all authors. The publisher, Puffin, must of been in a desperate bid for money when they decided to sign on this book to be printed.The story which starts with a girl called Timkin, an acrobat in a traveling circus,who is emidiattly thrown into an unrealistic and uninteresting plot. She later meets a man called Petie, arogaant and ignorant, who is bent on gaining more gold and riches. The end was over so quickly and fast it was like Kelleher was busting to go to the loo when he came to write the last few pages. Over all this book was a discrace, both to the author (yes, i will admit I liked some of his books) and to the publisher. When i think about it even metioning this book is a waste of breath."
2,'The Red King' Not-Rage Review,"A twisting tale of an acrobat, trickster, loyal bear and monkey, that take on the infamous deadly Red King. The characters are a bit dodgy and are not explained very well, and the trickster is too confusing to follow mostly. The story is of course extremely predictable, unlikely hero(es) take on very powerful and guarded antagonist. The settings however are quite good and under the Red King's volcano mountain is the best. Yet, again the ending is of so poor mystery and fantasy-thinking that the book should just end earlier to save the reader lots of time. It (the ending) is very predictable and is practically given away by making it obvious that the acrobat carries something around that is no importance right now, but definatley will be used. The Red King is a worth-while book for about 9 chapters, but the rest are bad. 'The King's pets'is especially good, in my opinion. The book rates 2/5 stars.'The Reviewist'"
1,The Red King,"Shocking, I was bored to death with this basic fairy tale. The book had good characters in Bruno a big friendly and hairy bear and Crystal a small but powerful monkey. However, the plot was as dull a blue tongue lizard lying under a rock in the middle of winter. It was the same as all the fantasy books ever written, a goody which always kills a bady. I was forced to read the book which also probably added to my discontent of the book. One good aspect of the book was its easy reading. It had no big words that would fool adults and was aimed at teenagers thus using their language. So overall the book had a few good aspects but I was disappointed in the book.."
3,Pretty average,"The Red King was an O.K. book but did not really seize the attention of the reader as there are many books with a similar theme. The 2 best characters were definetley Timkin and Bruno, Petie was pretty boring and was your basic mysterious guy.Overall the book was pretty average and deserves a 3 out of 5 at most."
2,Scratches Easily,This looked okay and was the exact size of an old one I was trying to replace. I cut some slices off a bell pepper on it and it's scarred badly. I know it's not a cutting board but the material seems very soft. It's the same material as the one I was replacing but it's much softer. I've cut veggies on the old one and it never scratched like this.
5,Nostalgia,"If you had seen Malgudi days as a child on doordarshan, you will surely relive those memories again, if you watch this DVD.Very worth gift for someone."
3,For the effort,"I had seen a couple of episodes on TV in India as a kid. This is an earnest attempt to bring RK Narayan's work to life, that said, it falls short. RK Narayan paints a very colorful world with words, rich, colorful, bustling with activity. This might just do it for a kid, but as you grow older, your expectations change, and the bar is raised higher. This may well be the best thing with the given resrouces, but I enjoyed reading the books more than the dvd. The other thing that stuck me was that though RK Narayan's books are in English, they are very much Indian in thought, but this DVD is in English and it is missing that Indian spirit, unlike the books which opens you to the rich colorful Indian culture, soceity etc, If you saw this as a kid, chances are you may not enjoy it as an adult."
5,A First Rate English Travel History,"Upon reading Gerald MacLean's account of the Anglo encounter with ""Near Eastern"" cultures i was thoroughly impressed with the depth and reach of the author's archival research and his lucid/friendly writing style. As a college instructor, i have been able to use this text alongside works such as Said's Orientalism in order to illustrate the fact that the xenophobia and repressive campaigns of British empire were not inevitable--that the ideology and practice of British white supremacy did not reflect the belief systems and epistemic modes of all the empire's white subjects. Please do yourself a favor and read this first rate work!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT IN PAPERBACK YET!!!!!!"
4,CJ 1 buy/book review,I rec'd the book in a very timely fashion. The book has some wear & tear but not bad for the price. I recommend this type of buying and I will be doing this again probably next semester.
2,much ado about nothing,"This was like a poor man's imitation of a Guy Ritchie film. It shows British men, of many ethnicities, fighting each other and engaging in illegal activities. In fairness, if you keep watching, the static characters end up having dynamic backgrounds. Still, this movie could have fit into a sitcom's time, rather than being the normal film length. It was dull in so many ways.The one good thing was Andy Serkis. As soon as you see him, you see his powerful, Herculean backside and they don't just show it once. If you have been saddened that Michael Chiklis have never filmed in the raw, Mr. Serkis is a good substitute. His tattoos may distract, but he's your man if you like burly, beefy types.For all I know, this may have been imitation ""Reservoir Dogs"" too. If you like machismo and bloodshed, then you will like this genre. Still, there is something about this film that is just sub-standard."
1,Short changed,Eating disorders covered in 2 pages? Behavior modification in 3?This book tries to cover too much & ends up imparting no new knowledge. Borders on irresponsible.
4,shipping,the pkg was prepared and shipped immeadiatly so the tracking and confirmatiom said however it was very very difficult to track it took 14 days to get here I have ordered stuff from china and got it in three bus. days. shipping thru this div of ups sucks.
5,"Good quality, cute, educational and my baby loved it","Good for boy or girl, we also bought it before we knew the sex. In the end we had a boy, he loves the animal and now know jiraffe, zebra, elefant and so on...very pretty and educational, good quality too"
4,finally a cooling system at a fair price,this is my third unit and have been happy with the build quality and results. great value. dont really like the temp sensor but it works.
3,Where's the answers?,"The book does not contain answers to its problem sets, which I don't find very helpful. Also, the grammar rules are often not very thoroughly explained."
2,Lower Quality than Expected,"This ""sweater"" is more like a shirt, as it is very lightweight. Further, for a cashmere sweater, supposedly from a premier manufacturer, it doesn't feel at all luxurious and soft like good cashmere products I own. It's almost like a soft cotton. The price, which I thought was going to be a fantastic bargain, is only fair for this level of quality. Overall, a disappointment."
2,Incomplete but useful...,"This book can be thought as a brief and incomplete summary of several linear estimation techniques and statistical tests for time-varying CAPM Betas, where Kalman filtering is presented as just one of these techniques, differently from what the book title suggests. There is an interesting chapter on Flexible Least Squares without a conclusion on its real usefullness on the calculation of time-varying Betas or on its link to KF. A comparison of the techniques (standard regressions x FLS x KF) is missing, and I had a hard time finding the computer code mentioned as the ftp server was de-activated (hint: [...]) These problemas aside the book is very useful for researchers engaged with time-varying regression models, with dozens of examples and plenty of source data and developed computer code written for GAUSS, that can be easily converted to other packages such as R or Matlab."
3,A Little Confusing FOR ME!,"1st, please don't make my review a deciding factor on buying this book or not, I just wanted to post my experience with it. This is my 1st Tanith Lee book and I have been told it should not have been. It was very much on the confusing side with the new language and all. Following the story and keeping up with the terminology was challenging and did not hold my interest. I barely made to page 100 and I have a rule that is a book doesn't at least peak my interest by page 100 then I am through with it. It is futuristic and sci-fi all in one, both of which usually don't grasp my attention. All other reviews of it was very good though. Will I try and read other of her books? Yes. Would I try and reread this one again? No!"
5,Peppino is Awesome!,"I watched and listened to Peppino play at a children's benefit concert. I was blown away with his playing ability and creativity. Since then, I have kept his cd playing over and over! I introduce his music to everyone I can. He is awesome! So far, everybody who has listened has fallen in love with Peppino!You will too! Buy the CD... You won't believe the volume of music that Peppino brings out of one guitar!"
4,Corporations and the Wage Squeeze,"This book is dated in many respects.The strength of the book is its details, it is one of the few books that investigates the many possible causes of falling wages in the U.S.A.David Gordon provided an index of ""real spendable hourly wages"" as a realistic measure of employee take-home pay.He looked at ""corporate obesity"" and investigated the ""reservation wage"" which is the pay rate that some potential employees may consider to be too low when seeking employment.He also looked at globalization, immigration, and ""skills mismatch"" and how they may possibly effect wage stagnation.The author argues that part of the problem is the top-heavy nature of corporations.""Fat and Mean"" is a worthwhile read despite it's age. Another strongpoint of this book is the documentation that Mr. Gordon provided in the book for sources."
3,"So, So","Alright, I'm 12 years old with good music taste. Jojo is alright...her voice is amazing, and I'm sure everyone will agree with me! The thing that some people do not like is the content of her music. Personally, I also think this is a little mature...I mean, I don't date and break up with people, but I know people who do. Reality is, life as a 7th or 8th grader is not exactly how Jojo describes it. Her songs have a good beat...even though they sound almost the same. The songs on the whole are good to listen to, but not to be taken so seriously. I would give this three stars for an AWESOME voice, good music, and effort. But she could be more age appropriate so that everyone can enjoy her CD.If you want to buy this CD, go ahead...just don't expect way too much."
5,Lovin it,"Yo i'm Lovin tha album, JoJo is my gurl no doubt! She can blow like iont' know what, and she decerves all the credit in the world! holla front at cha gurlie ~1 luv~ ~De~"
5,Awsome Album!,This CD is absolutly amazing! JoJo is an awsome singer and all the tracks are great! I can't stop listening to it. The songs have great beats and the lyrics are so well put together. Its so hard to believe this girl is only 13 her voice sounds so mature. Deffinatly a must buy album. Its bound to hit the top of many countdowns charts!
5,This CD is HOTT!,"Jojo's new Album is HOTT!!! it is soooo awesome! she is only 13, but she sounds AMAZING! she's already sweeping the nation! if yur thinking bout buying the album... i say u buy it now! while its HOTT!"
2,jo jo is no no,"when i first heard of 13 year old jojo in 2003, i tought ""wow their is another great talent waiting to get out"" i was wrong. not everyone can be a star especially jojo. her songs are pointless. this cd dosnt have good music, and some of the songs just dont make sense. i gave it 2 stars because i love this one song. but your waisting your money on this cd. sorry jojo, your not cut out for singing. bye"
1,This Youth Doesnt know the Truth,lets start with her first single....umm okay shes like 10 years old...like shes aloud to have boys in her room!!! She has a lot of growing to do... What are the music companys thinking...she has a nice voice but no substance...seeing that she was from blackground i expected a lot more than what was brought...I guess blackground will never recover after a plane brought down miss Aaliyah.
4,try listening first,"ok well as most people that like this cd they loved the song ""get out"" and bought the cd for that reason. there is some truth to saying that some of the songs sound a bit similar. she is 13 not 2 i hate everyone saying ""oh she's so young"" just cause they didn't go through things when they were young doesn't mean that girls today can't go threw similar things. i think she has a really amazing voice and i honestly think she's great. this cd is really worth it."
5,best cd ever made,(...) i am 12 and luv it. all my friend like it 2. and on the bus there is a radio and when leave comes on every one sings and every one i know that has this cd luvs it so bye it it is so worth the money.AND IF ITS SO BAD THEN WHY IS SHE IN MAGAZINES LIKE TEEN PEOLPLE AND #1 ON TRL ?BECAUSE SHES GOOD THATS WHY.
3,Mediocre debut from talented girl,"Boston's JoJo became a pop star mid-2004 after releasing a hard-hitting girl-power ballad called ""Leave (Get Out),"" but has found it hard delivering another hit single as delicious and sinful as her first. Like reigning pop queen Britney Spears, JoJo first hit the market at a young age too but, unlike Britney, hasn't been able to keep herself at the top of the charts. ""Baby It's You"" is a decent track but lacks the luster ""Leave"" had on radio listeners. The girl can sing well for her age, that's definitely for sure, but her sound isn't as unique as Britney's trademark growls. JoJo's debut is chocked full of mediocre by-the-number tuneage and, unfortunately, lacks anything close to being as good as its first single. Unless she can put out another hit-hit single or a better album it's unlikely JoJo will be able to have another 15 minutes of fame."
1,A Reply To A Dumba*s!,"(...) SHE HAS NO TALENT. SHE ONLY WROTE 1 SONG AND CO-WROTE 2. HER TALENT STOPS THEIR. HER VOICE IS JUST DECENT NOT GOOD AT ALL. OF COURSE YOU ONLY MENTION ""LEAVE,"" BEACAUSE THAT IS HER ONLY HIT."
1,JOJO's album,"hey guys, im very disapointed in her album cause its like they put her out thr like she was pop with ""Leave"" and then you buy the album and its nothing but ghetto r&b, but i guess thats marketing but i will never buy another jojo album!"
1,jojo back...never,"she is untalented! she does nothing with her music, except sing with her annoying, yet decent voice!she is a 1-hit-wonder and was on WPopTV's 1-Hit-Wonders Special!The album and all other singles after, including her latest ""Not That Kinda Girl"" flopped!She is over and will never be back!!"
2,This Is Horrible!,"Honestly, I didn't buy Jojo's album but I already listened to some of her songs. When I'm listening to her songs, I really feel cheesy. Her songs are very girly, and the topics of the songs she sings, they're really inappropriate for her age. I mean she sings about heartbreak, I think she still hasn't experience this and I really find it ironic. She's too young but she tries to be mature which I think is not right. If you compare her to Christina Aguilera when she was still 15 or 16 years old, she would seem bad, she's no match for Christina!"
4,what the hell?!?!?!?!?!?,"why are you all dissing jojo saying she is 'too young' to sing about the things that she sings about? YOU ARE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO GO THROUGH LOVE! YOU CAN HAVE YOUR HEART BROKEN AT ANY AGE! you really can and i should know, i am twelve and i have a broken heart at the moment from a guy that i loved and still love now. But that isnt the point. I think people that say jojo 'dont know what she talking about' are idiots and dont know what they are talking about themselves.To be honest im not a huge jojo fan but I wanted to say this to get my point across. On the point of jojo, i think her music is good and for thirteen she has an amazing voice."
4,The real review...,"First of all, stop being so negative and super sensitive. Yeah, the girl is 13, but after viewing the interviews and live performances, Jojo possesses something more mature than just her age. Its the industry itself that creates the image. They're suppose to grow up fast.The album I thought, was great. Being 13, Jojo can belt tunes like Christina Aguilera. Its not your typical teeny-bopping CD (ex. Hilary Duff, etc.), but a more urbanized-hiphop bop. If you took the time to read up on the little star, you would have noticed the record label she's under: BLACKGROUND! Home of Timbaland, Missy Elliot, Aaliyah, Tank and Tweet.To all who were disappointed -- just because she's white doesn't mean she'll do POP. Look at Kiley Dean, she was under the same label too.Next time you bash on an artist, be sure to check your facts."
1,Even makes a crappy pizza cutter,"Was Hojo that poor before she made ""Leave (Get Out""? So poor that she had to make crappy CD's? I stole from my sister to use as a pizza cutter and all I can say is that it has failed me to the point where I cant even look at it anymore. I also heard many songs here which vocally were above average, but lyrically? Come on! Does she really expect us to believe that she, a thirteen year old suburbian girl would go clubbin' or break up with twenty million guys? I dont think so, maybe some people would fall for that bulls**t, but me and any other smart people wont. It would be okay if she was at least sixteen, but thirteen? You gotta be kidding me! This is all lies! Lies, LieS, LIES!! And plus, even if you dont like the music the CD itself also makes the worst pizza cutter ever. Dont expect it to be a good mirror, frisbee, coaster or chew toy either, I've already tried all those."
2,What????,"when i first heard the song ""leave"" i was like ""oh, that's a cute song"". i was over at my friend's house for a party and they were playing the song and i kinda liked it but everyone was like ""i hate her it's so stupid what she's singing about cuz she's only 13"". i had no idea that she was 13. i hadn't really gotten a good look at her but from a glance at her music video i thought she was about 16 or 17. i think she has a good voice, however, i agree that it's pretty rediculous that she's singing about how her boyfriend cheated on her and how they're breaking up. i think her singing career would go much farther and last much longer if she would think of another subject to sing about."
3,Not the best,"I was a little disappointed in this cd overall. I bought it after hearing Leave, and I expected it to be a really great cd. When I listened to the cd, there wasn't a single track that made me excited about it. JoJo has a good voice, but this cd just did not do anything for me. She can sing, but the cd itself needed some work, especially the lyrics."
3,OK,"OK JOJO I THINK IS AN OK SINGER. HER VOICE IS JUST OK, SHE WOULD NEVER COMPARE TO CHRISTINA AUGELIRA. JOJO I GUESS IS PRETTY BUT WHERE DID SHE COME FROM. SHE SEEMS LIKE SHE GOT UP WHEN DAY AND DECIDED TO MAKE AN ABLUM AND SELL IT. PERSONALY THE CD IS OK BUT I WOULD SUGGEST BUY ANOTHER CD.P.S. FOR ALL U JOJO FANS SHE HAS A NEW CD COMING OUT SEPTEMBER 19, 2006"
4,Jojo-great singer and great looking,"Hi! This is my first review on Amazon.com so I will rate the songs for you with a little brief summary:1: Breezy is kind of a like ""dirty"" from Christina Aguilera's stripped.2. Baby's its you is a great song3. Not that kind of girl is the best song besides ""Leave (Get Out) on this cd.Numbers 4-14 won't be reviewed on this site because of space limits. Bye from Travis Okins of Franklin, MN 55333"
5,Soul,This girl has got soul. She has great pipes and athough she makes me sound bad i have to say that she is a very wonderful singer. I give her 5 stars because she deserves it.
5,"JoJo is sooooooo talented, buy this album!","This album is sooooo good. I would give all the songs 5 stars and the album over all 5 stars. She doesn't sound 13 at all. These are awesome songs with great lyrics, music, and vocals. I recomend this album to any age. It's sooooooo worth it."
3,re-review,"i sill love her song get out. im pissed she didnt write but 3 of her songs, but hell she is only 13. i hate pop music but ill give jojo props once again for this song."
3,she could be better.......and older,"""get out"" I must admit, was pretty deicent for a 13 year old. She's attractive and has a cute voice but why is a 13-year-old talking about such things? I'm no older than her (i'm eleven) but I am so not even considering cheates and hussies at the moment.Jojo has a good voice and if she waited a year or two, she'd blow up big. Right now, she needs to think about school related issues. Maybe a little crush song.....you know.... ""Oooh, i like him..."" or, ""Omigod, he is so cute!"" but cheating? are her parents okay with that?????I may be eleven years old but JoJo, take mt advice, ""Boys will always cheat on girls. You don't need to sing about it so soon. All older r&b; singers already sing about it. We don't need a tot singing too.""Other than that, I LOVE YOU, JoJo!!!!!!!!"
2,Where's the ENERGY??!!!!,"I was very disappointed when I listened to the album. I was glad that I didn't buy the CD at the Music Store, because it would have been a waste of money! I mean, don't get me wrong. She has great talent and AMAZING potential! [...]. But, most of her songs, well . . . all of her songs are about BOYS. You know, breakin up with them, lovin them. It is all of the same stuff. They were very slow and just not fun or energetic. The best songs are Leave Get Out, and Baby It's You. Those are the only songs that are decently good. JoJo, next album . . . make it more FUN, PEPPY AND ENERGETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then you will really be a STAR!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,She's Acceptable.. (but not better than Ciara),"It's relatively good... well her singles are. I think ""Leave(Get Out) is like Usher's ""Yeah"" although I love him. Consecutive playing on the radio causes it to become overrated. She turned 14 in Dec. She's just so young. And to come out with an album in your preteen years is pretty notable. Hell, I'm 18 (like Ciara) and haven't got a deal. But I know why. I haven't done much to promote myself yet. JoJo has. A Foxboro, Mass native who grew up in a one bedroom apt. with her mom and dad. The girl was poor. So I guess, she deserves it.I hafta admit it IS ironic though, how someone her age is talking so deeply about love. Ciara, me, Raven, we are old enough to know what guys, relationships feel like JoJo SO- listen to us. We're only trying to help. I hope her next cd is just as tight but good luck as far as voice maturing/puberty goes. HAha :)"
4,Surprising,"This cd is hot, I am not even playing. This girl can really sing. I thought that this was going to be another cd that would come and go but this cd has some tight beats and everything else. She could work on the lyrics a little bit more, but if you like R&B you shouldn't be disappointed. I was really surprised to hear what I did. I thought I'd be disappointed but I was far from it. I am a huge fan of music, all kinds, mainly R&B. I'd like to think that I am a trustworthy source."
5,Her Voice blew me out the water,"When I first heard her song Leave I was like whoa who is that. It took me so long to find info on her and now her cd is finally out. I rushed out to buy it and just fell in love with it. All 14 tracks have a true story to them and you can just put yourself in every song. I havent heard anything this great in so long. Not only is her voice amazing,but she is a beautiful young lady who is destined to be among the greatest. Buy the album and you will not be disappoited at all. This is not some young pop star one hit wonder we got a legend on our hands here."
1,JO JO did a NO NO!!!!,"jo jo is a good singer for her age but please stop comparing her to christina aguilera... she does not even light a candle to X-tina.... im just tired of young artist coming out talking about 25 year old subjects.... she needs to go back to school and get back in those books...JoJo not a good album at all... how dare she take one of the greatest slow songs of all time ""weak"" and try to make it her own.... she probably was not born when the song came out...the only song that i like is 'baby it's you' because it has a great beat and great bass in the song for my car....i dont even want to start talkin about the album because she is singing about stuff she should not even worry about right now for a 13 year old...why the rush to grow up...if these little teenagers wanna grow up so fast pay my bills!!! trust after all the bills you will wish you were still in middle school...just needs to stop soon...dont recommend this cd to anyone..."
2,2...maybe 3 good songs out of 14...,"i bought this cd because i loved the single Leave (get out) and i had money on me and i can never control myself when it comes to spending.but i'll admit, JoJo has a beautiful voice, very soulful, she sounds like a black female singing. yet....only 13... she's got potential, but i think this CD has been veeery manufactored.if you're anything like me, who likes the mainstream music on the radio right now..i like ashlee simpson, avril, modest mouse, katy rose , rooney, dashboard confessionals, usher, alicia keys...im tellin ya i like ALL types of music, but im not into poppy same soundin' music like JoJo has on her CD....just borrow it frm a friend or DL these three songs:Breezy ((and im not sure if i really like this song or not, cause its back and forth for me....))Leave (get out)Weak.....so save your money and dont be like me."
5,JoJo ROCKS!,"Hey. JoJo rocks! She is an awesome singer! She deserves every right to be top 5 in the world. Thats what I think. First time I heard JoJo, i was like, OMG! SHE IS AWESOME!"
5,Great Album!!,I just bought the JoJo album and it is absolutely great!! I loved the song when I first saw the video on MTV. It totally shocked me to find out she was younger than me and sounded so good. It's a great album so buy it!!
3,best album ever!,every one out there... if you dont have this cd yet youve gotta get out and buy it. i have never heard someone sing this well before in my life. JoJo rocks!
5,Jojo's cd is the greatest!,"This CD is great! I've been waiting for it to come out ever since I saw her single ""Leave (Get Out)"" on TRL and heard it on the radio! If you like pop music, this is definatly the cd for you!!!!!"
1,LOOK AT ALL YOU PAEDO'S,"She's only 13 Leave her alone, or else give it a big old baby!We used to do heaps but not really anymore. These days I spend most of my time dog-paddling, or fighting geese.JoJo has a funny face, because she has no pubic hair."
2,"Great Voice, but pretty generic....","I like the ""Leave"" track... The instrumentals are on point, the hook is right, and JoJo's voice is great...But honestly, and I'm not trying to say anything bad about the girl, because she really has tremendous talent, but the rest of the album, as far as the instrumentals is just too generic, almost felt like ""filler"" so that the album could hit the stores ASAP... the cover of ""weak"" was good, But I think JoJo has way too much talent to waste time with cover songs?From what I've read on other sites, the album was meant to focus on JoJo's voice and not to distract the listener with the instrumentals...All well and good, but I think many will agree with me that if the beat doesn't grab me right away, and the hook doesn't either, I'm skipping the track within the first 20 seconds."
5,~* OMG ONLY 13 YEARS old*~ ~*talented*~ N fabulous,"omg i Remember hearing JOJO's 1rst single ""Leave"" (Get out) and couldn't help but be totally impressed. IT IS HARD 2 believe she's only 13 but as a VOICE much older than her like Whitney, Mariah, or Christina. I loved every track. I liked how she mixes R&Bwith pop and some hip-hop in some of it. She's 13 who cares. Age has nothing to do with talent and that goes out 2 da person who says she's too young 2 be in showbiz or 2 make a CD. She's AWESOME!!!!!!!!All of the songs teens can relate to ages 13-19 maybe. But her VOICE MAN its soulful. She's just amazing."
2,Please Beyonce wanna be - get an identity,"Getting this CD on the strength of the great pop song Leave (Get Out) I have to say I was completely letdown. Not only did she try to sing like Beyonce way too much on all the other tracks she also tries covering SWV's track with no originality at all!And finally, it's too bad because she was pulling off a good impression of Nelly Furtado on Leave so there was hope for a good CD. Instead you get this typical sound in an attempt to be mainstream and end up with only filler.And really when you think of it...why would you want JoJo with her weak lyrics and boring beats whe you could have Nelly Furtado."
4,music fan,"I got this CD as soon as it hit the stores. I was blown away by this 13 year old girl's voice. Although there were some songs that did'nt sound that good, it's still a very good debut. I expect big things from Jojo in the future!"
5,Thank You Ritchie Le,"Finally someone gets it, i didn't read all 200 reviews but i'm 22 and graduated in 2000 and i've seen alot worse go on there than what she is singing about, every song she sings is very believeable with out being trash or cookie cutter like spears and aguliera. This world is much different than u older people grew up and for JoJo to keep sex out of the album at her age and look like a normal teen is damn refreshing. The song Not that kind of girl explains what she is about and even if she was to talk about a deep relationship, i'd still believe it - i pose this question to you - how many young HS kids do u see with a baby and or having sex? Leave JoJo alone the album is perfect for her and her age group and older people who appreciate good music and don't want there daughters to become toxic."
1,Grow some ears- this music is HORRIBLE,"Jojo may have a mature voice for her age, but that's all she has going for her on her self-titled album, Jojo.The tween's powerful voice is often overshadowed by the heavy beats and basslines prevalent in nearly every song on the album. By far, ""Leave"" is the best track because it has an appealing melody and Jojo's voice comes off loud and clear as it should.The other tracks on this disc are horribly overproduced, even down to the cover of SWV's early 90's chart topper, ""Weak."" I just get the feeling that Jojo's trying too hard, from the overemphasized ad-libs to the 18 year-old image she has been trained to represent.Save your money and buy a classic- this girl won't be around too long unless she changes her style."
5,SOoOoO Talented,"WOW! Jojo is so talented at such a young age. All the songs are great and i wasn't disappointed. My favs are ""Leave (Get Out)"" and ""Weak."" This isn't the last we'll hear from Jojo..she'll be around for a long time!! Ya'll should DEFINATELY buy the CD!"
1,HMM...A FLOP!,"NO TALENT!= DOES NOTHING WITH HER MUSIC! VOICE GOT GREAT...JUST DECENT!NO SUCCESS= UNKNOWN UNTALENTED KIDDIE STAR! HER ONLY HIT WAS ""LEAVE.""DROPPED= THEY LET HER GO BECAUSE OF HER ""CAREER PROBLEMS. THIS MAY HARM THE MOVIE AND JOJO NEEDS TO TAKE LESSONS. HER ACTING, AS WELL AS MUSIC ABILITY AND SUCCESS DO NOT GO FAR"""
1,keep giving her money,"I guess people in boston need this since they will never win a world series. But seriously, while you people are eating your macaroni and cheese and saving up for a night out, JoJo is buying her second house for her friends at the beach and you small people are only invited to buy her album. JoJo, you are singing everything teenagers want to hear because you can play a good game. That is what being young and naive is all about and that is what the majority of your listeners are. I will spend my money on The Dark side of the Moon."
1,0 Stars If I Could,"It just annoys me to see these little kids trying to act grown up!!!! What, this 13 yr old girl is singing about boyfriends, breakups, relationships, etc? Come on!! She's only 13! She don't know squat bout that. And she should try writing her own songs instead of trying to make it look like she older just because her songs are talking about this kind of stuff. And I also read an interview of her online, and she was acting like she's all old all ready and experienced life. She said to one question ""when I was younger I...blah blah blah!! When I was younger??????? YOUR 13!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,JoJo is a real NoNo,"i'm a big music lover and i like every kind from jay-z to britney spears to the beach boys and everything inbetween... but JoJo doesn't make the cut.This is one of the worst and most annoying cd's i have ever listened to. the songs are awful and just hearing them once is torture to your ears, her voice isn't really that good-- theres MUCH better out there, so why waste your time listening to her? not to mention they're terrible again, but JoJo is WAY to young to be singing about all this stuff. Hello-- can she relate to any of this? No. Like at her age she was in a ""serious relationship"" or the ""worst breakup"". That doesn't happen in middle school, its just all that stupid ""you're my boyfriend & i'm your girlfriend"" crap. Most kids her age can't even relate to that. Her songs are terribly unrelatable and not well written or sung, her Cd needs to stop being produced."
4,Catchy,"Jojo is a good singer considering her age. Some songs are kinda like wannabe rap. Some catchy tunes include Baby It's You, Not That Kinda Girl, Leave [Get Out], and Weak. I did not give this album five stars because some of the songs kind of go on and on and I wonder when they are going to stop. One of the songs is like five and a half minutes, as fast as I can run a mile. That's a bit over the top. Overall, this CD is good, and recommend it to people who like a good core CD, with a little bit of spice."
1,wow...,"This girl has no talent...if you ask me all her songs sound the same on the cd. Ive listened to it a few times to see if maybe it got better or something, but no. I dont reccomend buying this CD. the 2 best songs on the cd (get out and baby its you) are played on the radio so you can listen to them there, but dont bother paying for the rest of the songs that really suck."
4,Cute,"JOJO is an amazing talent. I couldnt believe that she has pipes like that! The music and some of the lyrics are a bit juvenile but overall this is a wonderful debut album for Jojo. She is amazing. The cover of the SWV song ""Weak"" is tremendous!!!! I advise everyone to go buy this cd. Support this girl!!! She can blow...not to mention she is soo cute."
1,TAKE A HIKE JO JO!!!!!!!,"THIS STUPID KID MAKES ME SOOOOO MAD! SHE CANT SING AND SHE HAS GRAMMER THAT'S WORSE THAN CHINGY BUT JOJO'S NOT A RAPPER. I HAVE HEARD THE SONG LEAVE(who hasn't?) AND IT IS TERRIBLE! HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF HER CHINGY LIKE GRAMMER.1 You said that you would treat me right but you ""was"" just a waste of time.2 you must have ""gone"" and bumped your headalso she stammers IN CASE YOU STUPID IDIOTS HAVE NOT NOTICED BECAUSE I KNOW Y O U - A R E - A L L - T O O - S T U P I D - T O - K N O W - A N Y T H I N G ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
1,Jo Jo needs to GO GO,"This girl sucks ass. She cant sing worth a damn and she wears more makeup than a clown and dresses like a hooker. She needs to act her age and learn to sing. Why do all these singers think that they can pretty much speak their songs and be good singers. Do not buy this CD it sucks. Its heartless too. All her reviews of ""omg shes so good"" must be written by little kids who follow every trend and morons. Jo jo must go"
2,Not my Kind of Music,"My friend loves this music. She thinks that JoJo is better than Hilary Duff! So I went on amazon to hear some samples of the songs on her Cd. I was kind of surprised because the music was like rap music and I hate rap music. JoJo is not a bad singer, her music is just bad. I think she sould sing songs like the ones Hilary Duff sings."
1,DON'T LISTEN TO THE GOOD REVIEWS,"First of all this kid cant sing to save her life. She obviously doesn't have much confidence in herself either and that is why she trys to act older than her age. She acts older because she wants to be taken seriously. I seen her on trl and she reminded me of britney spears. She was wearing tight clothes and lots of makeup and jewelry, and she seemed a little snotty to. It's good when britney does that but this kid is only 13! Also I think that her lyrics are a little to advanced. Your 13 for cryin out loud quit trying to relate to older pop stars. I don't like pop singers in general but this one especially makes me mad. It's ok because she's just goona be a one hit wonder anyway."
1,who is she,"i hate that dumb song they only play on z100 and disney radio on the radio by her. after looking her up, i found out she is a 1-hit-wonder. thats good....I finally don't have to hear anymore junk by this piece of sh*t!"
2,Good voice...bad music.,"It's undeniable that Jojo has a very mature voice for her age, but that mature voice is no excuse for the topics her songs address. She's only thirteen; she hasn't met the love of her life yet, she can't possibly have dealt with a cheating boyfriend that would have caused so much pain expressed in the songs she sings about it. What she should be singing about are things like puppy-love, trying to fit in with peers, or relations with their parents/family, things that thirteen year olds actually do deal with.The style of music, a pseudo-hip hop/destiny's child, isn't my cup of tea. I don't know what it is, but seeing a cute little white girl trying to be black (she SOUNDS black on this CD) doesn't appeal to me. Her amazing voice could be applied to much better music than this banal style she is currently singing.I give her 2 stars because she has a nice voice for her age."
3,ALRIGHT!,"The CD was alriht I do have to admit she has a wonderful voice. But the thing is she doesn't seem to have enough passion in her songs you think ""wow she can sing"" but you don't think ""I can really relate to what she's sayin"". Another thing is she has older men writting her songs like ""City Lights"" and I recently found out ""Leave(Get Out)"" is based on hEr kicking out her boyfriend.(HELLO THE GIRL'S ONLY 13!!)I don't know many 13 that go through some of that stuff @ 13 I was still chillin with Barbie and ken(LOL)I just wish she would've wrote more songs on the album or had better writters."
2,YOYO JOJO leave my yotown tonite...dig it?,"yo jo don mean to be offensive o' nothin but don't ya'll think you a little to young to sing about love?! come on dawg...but get mo' into serious mode here aite> so dig me cuz i dig your looks but not your singing. so come to my hotel peace out dawg and seee you .later dawg,coolboy"
1,jo-who? 1-hit-wonder is who!,no one over 12 listens to her or knows her.why do people review...isn't she some unknown untalented 1-hit-wonder from last year?
1,She Still Ain't,"after leave her she flopped!she is so untalented and manufactured...it is a good thing.and replying to one of the reviewers, YEAH! I DID SEE JOJO ON WPOPTV'S 1-HIT-WONDER'S SPECIAL! I WAS LIKE ""YEAH BABY!!"""
2,Very bad,"Jo Jo is 14 years old and acts like a 20 year old. That's not the case, her C-D is very bad.Why I hate it, is because they sound like something Brittney Spears would sing- all the songs!All the songs sound like them same thing. I couldn't tell the differance of the songs!They are wierd, and none of the songs make sence.If you want something real get something else.The only way she sold a lot is because it has ""Leave (get out)"". Don't buy this."
5,JoJo is very TALENTED,"After listening to ""Leave""(GET OUT) and seeing her Live at the Fashion Valley Mall in San Diego,Ca. I was amazed by her strong voice and talent.I purchased her CD and listened to it and it was actually really good. Her album got more of that Hip-hop and R&B vibe to it. All I got to say is ""DAMN SHE CAN SING"" you have to get her album.You can actually listen to almost her whole album without skipping it. I give her 5 stars. I'm waiting for her next album.I can't stand people who be hatin' Damn if the girl got talent and she can sing please put all that hatin' aside because you guys are only making her album hit Platinum. Thank You!!!"
5,The graetest fricken songs from a.........13 year old? hek y,"the graetest songs from a.........13 year old girl? hek ya and i own here album and it is the graetest ting I've ever hear'd and its even better that hilary's album's/songs I'm not going to convicne you that you should buy it but, let me tell you I love it and you will to so buy it if you want to hear good music this summer Plus this is the summer of taking risks.so take that risk and buy your self and your famly and friends the album.trust me you won,t be disapointed.sinserly a big fan or not!"
1,Artificial techno-pop,"Artificial drum beat, electronically enhanced vocals; is there anything here to like? This just appears to be an attempt by the record industry to create another pop-idol from a cute 13-year old, but instead of searching for 'cute', they should have started with a search for talent."
1,JoJo's Career Off This Horrible Flopped Album,Leave: a smash hit singleBaby Its You: a flopNot That Kinda gir: a flopthe movie: she got cancelled because of her career and no talent in actingwhere is she going: continuing on radio disney telling the dumb kid fans how she used to be famous!
1,she`s only 13 earning millions ... sad,"as Joana Nunez ""Joanita"" said - - we must get used to it.well that's what i want. when i first hear i want to be like wow that's what you call music. the lyrics, etc.this chic isn`t even a teenager. yet she sings about love, boys, ice, rims. she doesn't even know the meaning of any of those things. and to make it worse, she had to have a video and have bow wow in it .... now that is ridiculous!"
5,Jojo ~Jojo,Jojos cd rocks!i know that jojos cd ~JoJo will go to number one on the billboard charts!she is an inspiring new young singer that has a great voice and that has allot of tallent!i am a huge fan of jojo and her music and her cd is the best cd ever!it has all the types of songs you would want on a cd and all the songs will make you wanna dance and sing along to them.If you dont have awsome cd you need to go buy it now!thrust me this awsome cd wont dissapoint you.
