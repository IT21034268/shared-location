1,NOTHING NEW,"Unfortunately nothing new at all: Bollinger Bands, RSI and typical chart patterns. Unprofessional lay out, a lot of unused space and many peripatetic explanations. Maybe some ideas for absolute beginners. I will short this book and rather spend the money on a new Harry Potter novel."
5,INCREDIBLY FUNNY!,IMHO this is one of the most under-appreciated movies of all time. Seemingly noone has heard of it. The plot is similar to Dexter in that the young lady is fascinated with killers and death. So she goes to work for a crime scene cleanup company where everyone thinks she's a freak. But she is so childlike and innocent in her curiosity that the movie takes on a HYSTERICAL morbidity! This is truly a funny movie with a well-chosen cast. Definitely worth the purchase. And if you don't like it- you can always give it away! :)
5,Dark can be funny,This movie makes all other dark comedy's small in comparision. Acting and a rare script came together for a spectacular movie. There is no doubt that sometimes they do make original movies... Like this one!
5,A must see,"I was very surprised at how much I liked this movie. A student film, but with a little help from Quenten Tarantino he enables us to enjoy the dark side of life too. And I know, I know, not another Baldwin brother, but William pulls off the serial killer charactor like no one else could. A must see for anyone with a VCR and good sense of humor."
3,curdled,"Watchable, but not very entertaining. If you want a good dark comedy watch The Doom generation or Blood Simple. This movie falls short in too many ways to describe. The acting is mediocre at best, and the storyline drags. The concept is interesting, but they just don't do enough with it. Would do fine as a short film, but at feature lentgh it becomes, stretched too thin"
5,Curled is an easily overlooked Tarantino film,"This movie has an exciting plot with a serial killer on the loose. It has all the things you want in a Tarantino film including a well written plot, twisted comedy and lots of blood. The ending is sensational. Don't overlook this film like I almost did. This film will become one of your favorites to sit beside Pulp Fiction and Four Rooms."
5,Secret Serbian Wonder-Drug Exposed,"Vegeta allows me to come real close to duplicating flavors of Serbian style dishes I hadn't tasted since my granmother died 25 years ago.They now have Barbecue, Fish and Salad variants which contain no msg.SB (WARNING: It's Addictive!)"
5,"Great for soup, pilaf and cous-cous","I'm so glad to see this on Amazon! I first bought this years ago at a Hungarian food stand, but the stand is gone now and I was wondering where to get more. I add some of this to broth to boost the flavor when I make soups, rice, and cous-cous. I like the vegetable flavor, it's much better than other vegetable boullions I've tried, and it's convenient to use. I, too, wish it did not have msg, but you don't need to use much, so for me the amount of msg is tolerable."
5,Really good stuff,"I came across Vegeta about two years ago in a local store, have not been able to find it again since. I use it a lot instead of salt, rub steaks with it or just create soups. I'm happy to have found it again on Amazon for a reasonable price."
2,pros: great taste. Cons: MSG,"Please be careful with seasoning containing MSG. Our bodies don't process it well & it has very bad effects on the health of our brains, esp the more sensitive amongst us. Also, a lot of studies show its carcenogenic effects."
2,Not great,"This book just gives you the basics unfortunately. Was not very helpful, I would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead."
4,good but older info,"I was looking for information on the current state of the bottled water industry and market. The Good Water Guide was very informative on specific brands prevalant 10 years ago. Valuable, but not as helpful as would have been a current guide.Maybe an updated edition is in the works."
2,Disappointing,"The two tracks involving Elvis Costello are pretty good, but the rest of the CD is really disappointing. Some of these artists are rather lacking in terms of good singing voices, which really stands out in contrast to Paul Simon's beautiful voice that one is used to hearing on these songs. Not recommended."
2,2 measuring cups broke within 4 months,"Got these for Christmas, and I'm not impressed. I dropped 2 of them in the sink, and in both instances, the handles fell off. Not cool.Also, when I first got them, I had to clean them very carefully to deal with what seemed like leftover metal shavings.The measuring spoons (tablespoon) are fine, though.I'm going to try to get a refund on these."
5,Fabulous and fitting,"The shipping was fast, and the dress was true to size. It fit perfectly. This dress was elegant enough to wear to a formal dinner in front of the Eiffel Tower, and I felt fabulous in it! This dress caught the eyes of many people in fashionable Paris!"
2,Zip it Up,Well I recieved the dress very quickly and it fit perfect but the zipper was faulty and would not stay zipped. It would stay closed at the top but the teeth would eventually come loose exposing my backside and luckily i hadn't quite left the house when it was wide open. Not cool. The material was nice but i was not impressed. Maybe it was just bad luck. but this dress is going back.
3,lonely Spenser fights a blackmailer,"Susan has gone off to Washington DC on an internship, and Spenser is hired by a politician as a head of security, then asked to resolve a blackmail issue. The mob is involved! Other politicians are involved! The story is fine, although Spenser is lonely and is on his own most of the time, so not as much snappy dialogue as usual. Susan, when we do see her, now seems much more interested in shopping than I remember her, which is less interesting. Hawk shows up briefly and delivers the goods, as does Boston policeman Martin Quirk.Note on content: Some allusions to sex, including a description of a sex tape: Not a lot of detail, but still, there it is. A fair amount of strong language, including racial epithets. Plus shooting and punching!"
4,Typical Spenser,This short novel was the typical Spenser which is to say very good. I enjoy the mix of intellect and toughness of Parker's charachter. A good read as usual.
2,Ho hum...,"I wonder if Robert Parker has grown tired of Spenser. I have. This book just doesn't have the same feel as some of his earlier books. In this one, I had a hard time liking Spenser. He has a drinking problem. He's no longer just a gormet. He's a glutton. Finally, Spenser feels a little better, but only after a short visit with his girlfriend. Give me a break! By the way, Susan (his girlfriend) was a pretty shallow character in this novel.The weak plot isn't anything we really care about, even though it's supposed to involve some pretty steamy stuff. Instead, it's about some pathetic, unlikeable people who do stupid things---not very exciting. Luckily, it's a quick read."
3,Well worth having,"I have owned this album on LP and tape and it is one of a kind. the music exemplifies the period and the soothing qualities puts any new age mush to shame. Run, don't walk, to get it. at this price, its well worth having"
4,Worthy Recordings,Bruno Hoffmann gives a great performance in this album. This is a good disk to add to your collection of Glass Harmonica records. If you have not heard Glass Harmonica before I would recommend picking up Thomas Bloch's album entitled 'Glass Harmonica' under the Naxos label.
4,Great performance; but want more.,I found the quality of performance out standing. I would have enjoyed hearing more music that Franklan might have played himself.
5,Music for the Glass Harmonica,"This album is far and away the most beautiful and ethereal album I've ever come across. Years ago I had the vinyl 33RPM album and I LOVED it. With the standard changeover to CDs, I searched until I found it and then promptly bought 10 copies to give as gifts to friend. I cannot rate this album high enough because it's a 20 on a scale of 1-10. Yes, you read correctly.Gayle in Longview, WA"
4,Ready to dance around your kitchen?,"This CD is a blast! For those of us who grew up in the Northwest, it takes you back to the days of cruising Alki Beach while listening to KJR AM (""The Squire Shop presents...the Northwest Battle of the Bands!""). If you didn't grow up in the Northwest but love the garage band sound, it's still a lot of fun. Highly recommended."
5,Senseo extra large water tank,"I like this water tank for the Senseo coffee maker because it is just the right size that you do not have to refill too often. The tank that comes with the coffee maker needs to be refilled after two large cups of coffee. When you add water, you can set this tank on the counter and it stands alone, you do not have to hold it, whereas the smaller tank (that comes with the coffee maker) needs to be held. I am very happy that I purchased this tank."
3,A Little Leaky,It is convenient not to have to refill the reservoir so often but I find more water leaked onto the counter with this than I did with the original equipment. It does fit the coffee make fine.
5,Senseo Extra Large water tank,The best ever. The small tank is great for one person but for two you need the bigger tank. Was the best thing I ever bought.A must for two or more what a great addition to a wonderful coffee machine. Linda Johnson
5,Senseo large water tank,"I love the convenience of the extra large water tank. I have at least3 large mugs of coffee every morning, so I only have to fill it once.It makes it so quick and easy."
3,Essential but way overpriced,This tank is really essential if water is not available close to where you want to use the coffee maker and it works fine. Also much easier to fill than the regular tank because it will stand upright on its own. But it's way way too expensive for what you get.
3,Not a great purchase,"I ordered the file in the picture. They shipped one with one file drawer and two regular drawers.The delivery person refused to leave with the item.Called for service, and the person was extremely nice about the error.They wanted to have the file returned before they shipped out a new one to replace it, but I needed a file ASAP.We decided to keep the incorrect item and trade it out with a different file in the office. However, the wheels on the unit would not install. We would have had to drill with a metal grade bit in order to get them on.I would not purchase this again."
4,Genre-ific!,Everyone should read this to learn more about Hollywood genres and realize that today's Hollywood is much different that how film used to be shot.
1,Garbage on DVD,"A show about annoying,whiny brats saving the world from adults...whoever thought up THIS garbage should have their head examined.In the entire series,you put up with constant whining,sniveling and sheer stupidity as 5 noisy brats run around annoying everyone arounsd them and generally being up to no good.Cheap animation and no plots make ""Kids Next Door"" an unbearable torture for veiwers.This series is so irritating that it would make Bart Simpson throw himself into a volcano.If you want entertaining funny kids,get ""Dennis the Menace"" instead."
5,I love this show,"I agree with a lot of the POSITIVE reviews. This show is really great because it's funny, clever and entertaining. The only reason why some would view it as ""bad"" is because they take it way too seriously. The thing is: cartoons are meant to be oddly proportioned, funny qualities (accents, personalities, etc.) are all part of characterization and the plot of this cartoon is based solely on FICTION.One can easily admit that kids don't need to fight adults, or that it's ridiculous to fear the dentist. It's up to the viewer if they'll let those principles sink in. The main point is that this cartoon is meant to be from the perspective of a CHILD. A lot of kids tend to view the world in hilariously delusional ways and this cartoon portrays it in the most ADORABLE way!I won't recommend anything. All I leave is my opinion that this cartoon is WONDERFULLY CREATIVE."
1,Garbage on DVD,This is stupid. You only get 10 episodes on 1 DVD. There needs to be season sets of this wonderful show.
1,Crap,"This show freakin sucks!!!!! Who the heck would watch his garbage?!!! I remember when Cartoon Network had good shows like Cow and Chicken, now they just air crap. It's not just the kids next door thats bad it's everything they have on, Samurai Jack, Teen Titans, Totally Spies, Code Lyoko, they all suck. Not to mention the fact that all those titles are psuedo animes. Kids Next Door isn't but it's just as bad. Please, whatever you do don't spend your money on this, you will be sorry."
2,Not like the dentists,Works a little bit but nothing like the Dentist real tools. To skinny for handling and doesn't get around teeth very well. Good for basic scraping.
3,Lighted compass,"This compass is relatively cheap so my expectations were not real high. What I really wanted was a compass where I could turn the light on at night and it would stay lit - this compass does not do this, you have to depress the button to have it light. To depress the button you have to open the flip case. This takes 2 hands - which was not always possible while I was using. I tried it out while paddling a canoe at night. While trying to open the case with one hand - the battery cover popped open and the little batteries popped out. I have still yet to find a good compass I can use that has lights. I'll keep trying. (BTW - I was able to retrieve the batteries and fix the compass - but it really is not suitable to my needs)."
2,Would not buy for large tank,"The sides do not have suction, the clips do not hook to tank because the top of tank black rim around tank (not the top) is to wide for the clips. I have the tank decor holding it in place. I would have given a one star if I didn't like the plastic, the food doesn't get through and I do have to eithe invest in a better separator or another heater. This does prevent heat from circulating in my 50 gallon tank. I put the separator in the middle of the tank to determin this with thermoitors on both"
3,Flimsy,"Thus far does the job, but the dimensions are a stretch and its a bit flimsy. Probably worth $11 dollars but the fish I'm protecting with it are worth way more."
4,Works well.,"Keeps my angelfish fry separated from the larger fish. There were some very small gaps against the glass, but the little fish soon learned it was safer to stay on their own side."
5,Great utility knife,"This product is easy to operate, safe and does the job. It looks good and fits snugly into your hand."
4,Good utility knife,I've used this for a while and it has withstood all the abuse. I like the grip and trigger action to get the blade out. I would prefer a slightly bigger button or different mechanism to retract the blade but overall very good.
5,Great knife,"I have had three altrade knives over the past ten years, and still have them in various tool boxes.This is the best utility knife I've ever had, and I've had many knives. On a rating of 1-10.Ten would bethe number."
5,Saving time saves money too!,"I've used a lot of utility knives, but this one takes the cake! The downfall to most knives on the market is the speed of the blade change. This one is incredibly easy - and fast! Not only does the blade extend as soon as you sqeeze the handle, but it retracts just as quickly with the push of a button. My biggest reason for liking it though, is that I don't have to open it up in order to get to the next blade once the first one is worn out. Just squeeze the handle again, and out pops the next blade. I'm back up and working in less than 5 seconds! For the money, I expected something with this many features to be cheaply made, but I had to give it a try. This thing is solid! In my opinion, this knife is far and away the best knife on the market when you consider the features, quality and price. Nice job Alltrade!"
1,Dissatisfied,"I was a bit skeptical upon buying this, because of the spring loaded button that retracts the blade...and at first i thought the knife was great. however, i am a carpenter, and i use this very frequently every day, and have been for 3 weeks, and its already starting to not retract the blade fully when pressing this little button. it seems it is not very durable, in my opinion."
5,Great Grip and Design,This is a well designed and heavy duty utility knife. The well constructed grip inspires confidence as well as the clever locking and retract button on the handle. If you are looking for a great all around utility knife this is your pick.
2,"great knife, but mechanism wears out quickly","Have used several of these at work. We use them every day, but not all day and not hard. It is a great knife from comfort and ease of use. I like the easy retract button and a simple squeeze to extend. The autoload functioning of the new blade is great.But at the price, you go through them too fast. The mechanism for extending and retracting wears out pretty quickly. The mechanism get sticky to the point of becoming non-functional. Have tried making sure was lubricated and all that. No difference.It really is too bad that the feature that sets this knife apart from the field fails so quickly"
5,Hnady Tool,"I use this for cutting up boxes while working at the local library. I like the large handle. Some of the 'ordinary' cutters I have used tend to stick when sliding the blade in and out. As a result, I often leave the blade exposed when not using the knife. This one works easily, so I am more likely to retract the blade before setting it down.Changing blades is quick and easy. I haven't found an easy way to simply switch ends on a blade, so I may end up not using one end of a blade."
2,Not sure if it's me or the knife,"I just can't get the hang of this thing. At first, when I tried to change the blade it just spit them out on the ground. Now it won't change blades at all. It's also dirty from use, and I think that's jammed up the mechanism. So, for around the house use, it may be great. But on a worksite, I'm not so sure. Maybe I'll clean it well and WD-40 the heck out of it and see.Also, because it's so fat at the cutting end, it's difficult to use a level as a cutting guide; you need to use a thin ruler or similar.I prefer my little foldable utility knife; blade changes also don't require a screwdriver and are fast. And it's much smaller. If it only had blade storage, it would be perfect."
1,YUCK!,"Nice idea, but the blades will fall out when pressing down hard while cutting and frequently will not retact without holding the release and pushing the blade back in."
1,Bought 5 and 3-1/2 months later none are usable,Loved them at first but I bought 5 and slowly but surly one at a time they jammed and were unusable within 3-1/2 months.
5,Best utility knife I ever used,"I have owned this knife for several years and love it. Although it has been dropped several times and continued to function without missing a beat. Unfortunately today a small piece that the blade slot hooks unto has broken off. I was in the middle of trimming carpet and needed to have a knife quick, ran to the hardware and ended up with the only choice they had, a Stanley and it is worthless. I am so pleased to see that Amazon carries the Alltrade knife. I am going to buy two so if I ever get in a bind again I won't have to settle for something less. THANKS ALLTRADE FOR MAKING A GREAT PRODUCT."
5,This is THE KNIFE!,"I love this knife. No more accidental pokes. No more slicing my tool pouch! Safety all around! My Stanley retractable utility knife has a blade lock to lock it in position, but the release button for it is right under my hand and always gets pressed in during use and retracts the blade while I'm using it. I have never had that problem with this one. In addition, it gives me something to fiddle with while I'm thinking through an obstacle! I have three of these knives and am asking/looking for more. I thoroughly recommend this product."
2,Did Not Like.,Product was probably defective but was awkward and dangerous. The movement of the blade was faulty.
4,fascinating though incomplete,"As a member of a minority group in Japan whose existence was unexplored by the contributing authors, I was somewhat dismayed upon reading my copy. The topics addressed in this book made for fascinating reading. One would hope that future editions would include a chapter,or perhaps more than a passing reference to the problems of the Konketsuji, or mixed race groups of Japan, whose members include some of those whom the Japanese most despise and who face some of the more insidious forms of discrimination in Japan."
2,"Not useful for a ""messie""","If you are familiar with the usual ""messie"" terms, I would say Ms. Barnes is ""born organized"". She talks about how she helped her mother from early on keeping up the house and a business. She apparently was never at a ""total mess"". If you are completely disorganized and don't know where to start, this book probably will not help you. There are some sections on closets and the kitchen that give you directions on organization."
5,Great ideas for organizing your home,This book is full of practical ideas for organizing your home and life. I read the book within 36 hours of receiving it. It was informative and fun to read. Both authors are Christians and their faith fills the pages of the book. I have already implemented many of the ideas and it was simple to do so.
2,wouldn't have ordered More Hours In My Day,"Had I known better the contents of this book, I would never have ordered it. I wish there was a way to obtain a better idea of subject matter. This book is geared toward much younger women, women with small children. I am retired, a grandmother whose grandchildren live thousands of miles away. I would like to return this book, but fear it may be too late to do so. I used precious gift funds from my children to purchase this book and sincerely wish I had not. It could be a good book for younger women, but not for me."
2,NO ONE is dis-organized enough for this book to be helpful,"Maybe if you've never been on time for an appointment or never paid a bill that wasn't already late, this book is for you. If your house is disorganized and you want to get it together, there are 10 good pages for you (start on p. 138). Kinda expensive to buy the whole book for THAT. Never have so many paid so much for so little."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"This book should be given at every bridal shower... Emilie has done a WONDERFUL job of teaching us how to change our homes to be more organized, productive, relaxed, enjoyable and GODLY! She shows step by step how to get organized, without becoming overwhelmed. Emilie's Christian testimony is an inspiration to any woman... One online review called her ""born organized"" and that may be true, but that makes her a wonderful authority in showing us the way to total rest! :)"
5,Everyone in the family should read this book!,"Emilie Barnes has some truly great ideas, and she writes in a way that motivates like no one else I've ever read. I've read a lot of books on how to get organized, but until I read this book I just couldn't find the motivation. Now I am on my way ""from Total Mess to Total Rest"". I have a goal now that I would love to meet Emilie Barnes and thank her in person for saving my life and my sanity"
2,Might Give It Another Try Some Day,"I endured about 75 pages of navel-gazing and finally put the book down. Generally, I like 'heavy' introspective books, but this wasn't going anywhere and the main character wasn't interesting enough to carry it along. I think it was around the part where he found himself oddly fascinated with the various matters his body produced, such as 'stools and snot' that I literally tossed the book aside and picked up something else. I might give it another try, eventually but, then again, maybe not."
5,Banville deserves the Nobel Prize,"ECLIPSE is one of the most beautiful of contemporary novels, by perhaps our greatest living novelist."
5,"Tarmvred - Atmospheric, nostalgic and fun","It is hard to come up with comparisons for Tarmvred's work. To me it sounds like modernized 80's video game music, but that description could give the wrong impression. If you like Massive Attack, FLA, Squarepusher, Underworld and you think that you have broad tastes when it comes ot electronic music then you should certainly check them out. I love the beats and find the music to be very atmospheric."
4,good book,"This book is well written, the author is well educated, he is also a hero.The book accounts how he learned to fly and some of the experiences he had in the first world war. If you are interested in the air war during world war one, this is a good book. It is different than the other books I've read about world war one. Different squadrons had different experiences. This book is less about wild binge drinking, and more about the everyday activities of the pilots. The author was serious about what he was doing there, and had morals evidently. If chosing this book for a teenager, I would prefer it over some of the other books about world war one."
3,"Does not fit big bottles, otherwise fine.","I chose this wine rack due to space constraints. I have not stacked them, so I don't know how that works, but they seem to be what I expected. The construction is good enough and it fits small wine bottles. I have it in an out of the way place, so I am not bumping in to it (that was a concern for earlier reviews with the wine bottles falling out if you bump into it). It is not made of titanium, so it is somewhat flimsy seeming, but again, did the job for me. I don't know that I would use it for display."
5,Real Space Saver.,"Great product! Ordered one & liked it so much, I got 2 more! Very inexpensive way to store your wine. Put them together in whatever configuration fits your needs. I can now fit & have easy access to a dozen bottles on just one small shelf of my refrigerator."
5,No regrets!,Absolutely wonderful! I can't believe how sturdy it is!This is a must buy! Don't settle for anything else!
2,2 bottles... not 4,"I was highly dissapointed when I received this today... It is NOT a 4 bottle rack, it only fits 2 bottles... If you want it to fit more you have to buy more pieces. The ad and the box say 4 Bottle Rack."
4,Serves its purpose,sturdy enough to hold 4 bottles. Slim design makes it compact. Not fancy but works as designed. To get 5 stars it the wire below the bottles has some stickyness to them it would hold the bottles a bit firmer. Its a tiny complaint which overall does not ruin the product.
5,Compact and cool design..,"If space is limited, this wine rack works great! IAll the other reviews sold me on it. bought just one to see just how rugged it was...It's very strong and the wine bottles are secure.I plan to buy more and add on."
3,Serves it's purpose,Fills the space above my small wine cooler. Couldn't find one in wood this size so had to settle for this. Not the easiest to get bottles in and out of but better than nothing.
4,Nice simple product,"I ordered this because I had very little space to store wine. It's easy to set up and holds the wine as described. It has very simple design which works well for me because I didn't want it to ""stick out"" in the area where the wine was going to be stored. Nice simple product."
3,Satisfied,"Overall,i am happy with this product. At first, i was going to return it, because the accuracy kept changing, but then, i found that it is definetly accurate for sure! Good scale and nice style!"
3,Broken frame,I bought a similar model Taylor 7362 and the frame cracked after a year of use. I was able to epoxy it with a metal brace that seemed to work for a while but it broke again. I liked the big display (it measured in 1/2 lb increments so the new models that weigh to a tighter tolerance may be valuable if the strain gauge weigh scale works reliably). For $20.00 one can't expect too much. I will probably get another one and recover the lithium battery for future use.
3,Not very accurate!,"I weigh myself everyday and I wanted a scale that would be more accurate than the cheap $6 scale I picked up from Walmart. Unfortunately this scale doesn't seem to be that much different from the $6 Walmart scale. First, it is not very sensitive and does not register small changes in weight (although I bought this scale because the manufacturer said it was accurate to 0.2lbs). I tried getting on with various weights and it would not register these small differences. I would say that this scale reads approximately plus/minus one pound of your actual weight. If you keep that in mind and are not annoyed by the one pound room for error, you may be happy with this scale. On the plus side, this scale looks very nice with the large digital readout and it is also very light. I will keep it but I am dissapointed that it couldn't have given more accurate readings."
2,This scale is all over the place.,"This scale is all over the place - it changes its mind in minutes - so quite frankly I have been yo-yo dieting to please, which is ridiculous. I don't think it is accurate most of the time..."
5,easy to use,For the scales being digital they are very easy to operate compared to other digital scale.
2,Take a pass on this one...,"I actually bought this for my mother for Christmas to replace our standard ""non-digital"" scale. I thought this would be a nice upgrage, but I was sadly mistaken. This scale didn't even work correctly out of the box even after several resets. It would basically have a ten pound tolerance in either direction. You would weigh 175 one minute, 185 the next, 165 the minute after that.On the positive side, it sure looks nice.It was opened on the 25th of December and it was packaged for a return the very same day."
1,No quality control,This product was defective out of the box. I tried to recalibrate it but still the scale did not function properly. Returned to Amazon and received a full refund.
3,problems,"I've owned this for about 1 year. I agree with a previous reviewer. The weight seems to get stuck and you need to add a significant amount of weight to get it to give you a new value. It's probably a trick to make it seem consistent, but over time the behavior becomes apparent."
1,Dissatisfield and disappointed,"I was looking for a very accurate scale to upgrade from my old antique but this gadget was worse than the antique. It sticks on whatever weight you registered the last weighing, which sort of nullifies the purpose of scales. Try another model and another brand."
1,Do not buy!!,I don't normally give reviews but I am very disappointed in this product. Every reading seems to have a 2-3lb difference. If you are trying to lose weight this is not the scale for you. I have had 5 different readings within minutes. I really regret buying this scale.
1,No Stars,"I just received this item and it says I weigh 37.5 pounds. Flattering BUT... And, yes, it is set to read in pounds. It is so light weight and totally plastic. Looks, feels and works like junk. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM."
1,Feel Tinner With Taylor - Real Garbage,I bought a Taylor Large faced scale from Amazon. Taylors enclosed literature tells me how great the product is. On 150 pounds it is lower by 6 1/2 pounds. [that is almost a 5% error rate] . It is totally unusable and unreliable - total garbage !!!!
2,"Good Price, but complicated watch","I have been waiting to buy a gps type watch, and the price was finally right. Well, I am not a rocket scientist, but I am a physician, and this is in my opinion not user friendly. The heart rate monitor worked fine, but the GPS function was not so good. I run on trails, so maybe that was the issue. In short, I returned the watch. Thanks for reading. Dr. 9"
4,great aid,"Geat aid; very useful in training for age group compitition. The only thing that bugs me is occasionally I will glance at my speed and it will be way off on the watch, but is always correct in training manager.Suunto T3 Heart Rate Monitor and GPS Pod Multisport Pack - SS012695000"
2,Not for big kids. Waste of money. Much info already on Hawaii websites.,This DVD is only for small kids/toddlers. We have kids 12 and older and we can get more information (with more exciting activities and destinations) from Hawaii's own websites. Don't waste your money on this DVD if you have big kids. Very basic tourist information.
2,hard to keep turned off,"Not what I thought. Really hard to keep it ""turned off"" with the silencer and I dont particularly like the sound of the bell - they went into my junk drawer."
3,Inside of the bell was missing,This looked neet and i thought my little boy could use it when we are out in the woods so I can keep track of him.. I sent it back and got a full refund but I didn't want another one. Should work ok if the inside was there...
1,Have fun dying,A .50 cal hand gun (E.G. s&w 500 or a .50 AE)Trumps the worthlessess of hiking bells or bear mace anyday .
5,Wonderfully fresh new stories about 'a boy and his dog.',"The characters of Henry, a little boy, and his big dog Mudge, a St. Bernard almost as big as Henry, appeal to my four-year-old. The easy-to-read, fun to listen to style that Cynthia Rylant brings to these stories is so welcoming that they invite you in like a warm and cozy home on a cold winter's night. These three short stories are just a few of the everyday adventures in the life of Henry and Mudge, told with catchy phrases and lots of character expressions to expose the loving friendship that they embrace. With bedtime a challenge for a pre-schooler (who has a wild immagination), we find this particular book a comforting and reassuring way to end a long day. We highly recommend this entire series, but expecially this selection. Our next favorite is ""Puddle Trouble,"" but do read them all!"
5,Favorite clippers,Love these clippers. I am a dog groomer and these are all I use! Really good price too. I recommend these to every one
3,pinches nails,I really hoped this would work well. My old clippers were dull so I bought a replacement. they are made of thinner metal & the plastic is cheaply made. the clip to hold it closed swings loose while you are clipping & gets really annoying. the clippers 'pinch' or squeeze the nail before it actually cuts. dogs don't like it.
5,Work well.,Very sharp. Good instructions. Let's see how long they last. I bought another brand and the handle broke after only a few uses.
5,WAS HAPPY I BOUGHT THESE,I bought two nail clippers on the same day one of them being this one and the other being a nail clipper that can detect the quick. I first tried the quick detector thinking that was a great concept. It was bulky and hard to maneuver with an uncooperative dog so I switch to this took. I LOVED it. I was able to finish the nail clipping in 15 minutes with no incident; which is a miracle all in itself. I HIGHLY recommend these clippers. I prefer this type to the guillotine type as it is easier to maneuver and see what you are doing so less chance of nicking the quick.
5,One of my all time favorites!,"I just loved this movie - it's not well known, so if you haven't seen it, don't miss it. And the soundtrack is fabulous. I still listen to it after so many years. Great latin music. Well worth the cost."
2,The Old Feint and Switch,"So you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about Hemingway's ghost and you're ready to drop some cash, right? Guess what--there's zero information about the Hemingway haunting in this book! In addition, old Ataulfo of Madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic's version of Handel's Halleluja Chorus. Instead, what's offered here is a rehash of old stories (and old theories about what ghosts could be) with insipid, comic book illustrations. Why this is called a ""field guide"" with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists. If you're a serious researcher of this subject, then pass this book up and seek Hem's fetch elsewhere."
1,Junk,I'm guessing that by now the company is out of business... and with good reason. The cartridge never did work.
5,Wonderful resource,"Tons of examples! It's a nice mix between theory and applications, citing scenarios from all industries. Not only do they show you the code, they also produce the output and go through it section by section."
2,This Band Needs a New Drummer,"There are so many reasons why this albumn remains a great let-down after August. We feel one of the largest is that of the loss of a great and original drummer to a man who does not know how to do anything interesting with a 4-4 beat. The recrd continues to appear to have been thrown together, which is very saddening when one thinks of all the talent that this band has."
1,From sublime to ridiculous,"I was so impressed by Counting Crows' original and captivating initial effort, August & Everything After, that as soon as the follow-up (Recovering the Satellites--deserving of no more than parenthetical mention)was released, I bought it without previewing it.Well, that's another life lesson learned.Perhaps there was extreme pressure to release a second CD while the time was ripe. The time might have been ripe, but the music and the creativity were all too green. The lyrics were trite. The stale musical fills not only lacked horribly in creativity, they were repeated and repeated to an agonizing degree--a case of substituting quantity for quality.""August"" remains a musical gem in my collection. Had I not known the quality of which Adam Duritz is capable, I might have given this second effort a marginal second star. It just isn't within me to reward complacency, however."
5,Great Album--And Defense,"A Great CD. I don't need to say much more to promote it, just a small amount to defend it. Please notice that most of the disheartened remarks come from the time period of April 6-12. Also, most locations are in California and Nevada (Because this kid can't think of any cities outside Cali.) Very few remarks are about the music, but Adam's 'hair extentions'. Does it take a detective to figure out that this is the attempt of a feeble mind to express himself forceably? We can easily see that this boy who called CC fans ""people with no lives"" himself has no life and excersized his free time to submit repeat reviews. Don't insult yourself- give this album a good listen."
5,A beautiful follow up to August and Everything After,"Recovering the Satellites is a wonderful album filled with emotional and introspective songs. Songs such as Catapult, Angels of the Silences, and Recovering the Satellites are amongst my favourites on the album. Although AAEA still stands as my favourite album of all time, Recovering is definitely close up there."
5,This Is My Favorite CD,This is the CD you want if you like folk rock. The msic is so great and the songs are perfect there is no way you could say you like August and Everything After and not this.
4,Good 90's album,"This is the ""Counting Crows"" best album probably next to their first. I still like this album even though it is older now. Recommend highly. And the price is good!"
5,Masterpiece...,"Six years after the release of this album it continues to challenge and move me. This is one of the finest albums I have ever purchased. Every line that Adam Duritz pushes out of his throat is deeply resonant and extremely passionate and the band, THE band, they are amazing! The guitar solos are brilliant, percussion is brilliant, and of course Charlie and Dave are amazing. Buy this album. In six years you'll still be spinning..."
3,"Good Effort, Live Album Improves The Songs","I generally like the Counting Crows, but I get sick of them after a while because the lead singer's plaintive singing becomes whiney and forced like he's suffering from a hernia or something. So the songs on this album are very good, but the whineyness (emotionally overblown) really ruined it for me.If you want to hear the songs played in a less grating and more confident manner, get the live album, Across A Wire."
5,This is an excellent album....,"but it seems as if written by different people than August and Everything After. i don't think that it should be compared to AAEA. The one thing that I think should be mentioned is Goodnight Elisabeth. That song ties the albums together with the line, ""baby if yo're the queen of Calafornia/ I am the king of the rain"" (That song ties it together because on AAEA there is a song called Rain King)I think that this is a great album...not to be missed!"
1,Terible Album--And Defense,"A terrible CD. I don't need to say much more to trash it, just a small amount because it's really bad. Please notice that most of the heartened remarks come from the time period of April 6-12. Also, most locations are in California and Nevada (Because this kid can think of many cities because he is so intelligent.) Very few remarks are about the music, but Adam's 'hair extentions'. Does it take a detective to figure out that this is the attempt of a strong mind to express him self forceably? We can easily see that this boywho called CC fans ""people with no lives"" himself is too smart to listen to a band fronted by a guy who's self-confidence is so low that he must wear a wig. Don't insult yourself by listening to this horrible music."
4,"It's Not AUGUST, But It Is Good","Not the masterpiece that the Crows presented with AUGUST, but SATELLITES is a quality album from a band that is still going strong. Moodier and darker than AUGUST without the endearing lyrics and ""story"" feel. Still a high recommendation for this effort."
4,Soulfully poetic,"The opening song sounds very similar to Badfinger's ""Flying"",and some of the music later reminds me of the Gin Blossoms,but otherwise this is a terrific album.Thoughtful in concept and played beautifully,it grows into a listener each successive time."
5,Another hit for the crows,This second cd set has everything that was not in the first cd. From the deep lyrics of A Long December to the fast paced Angels of the Silences it is an all around great album.
2,Not their best CD...,"Counting Crows is a great band; they have proved it in ""August and Everything After"" and the recent ""This Desert Life"", but I'm sorry to say ""Recovering the Satellites"" does not reach the standard set by the others. The songs sound a little noisy in general; it seems to me it's kind of an ""experimental"" album - as thought they were trying new things. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be good. I bought this CD not knowing any of its songs, and it was a disappointment... if you really like them, though, it's not a total loss: there are some great songs, such as ""Mercury"", ""A Long December"", ""Walkaways"" and Goodnight Elizabeth"", but I guess that's all there is about it..."
3,I like their first album more,"This is a good album, but I liked the Counting Crows first album ""August and Everything After"" more, because it seemed to be more structured. This album has a few great moments, but the songs blend too much and start sounding bland, but its still a great album for fans of American Trad Rock."
1,Very Dissapointing,Why can't these guys at least try to do something remotely interesting for a change? Can't they come up with a new idea? Why do they have to burden us with their awfull music? What did we do?
1,don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time with this very disappointing CD. August and Everything After was truly a remarkable effort. Songs such as ""Sullivan Street"", ""Anna Begins"", and ""Raining in Baltimore"" are classics. Unfortunately, the band abandoned producer T Bone Burnett (from August and Everything After), in exchange for another producer. The result is a jumbled mess of disjointed emotion and tuneless dirges. Perhaps their live album will be better. Adam, please bring back T Bone Burnett for your next studio CD."
1,Adam's Misery Bores Me,"Hard as it is to believe, this cd is actually worse than the first Counting Crows disc. More self indulgent, more whiney, more everything. The weird thing is that is seems like Adam's hair has grown from the first disc to this one. But adam wears a wig, so how is that possible? Did he get a new wig so it would look like it grew?"
1,Phonies,"I thought these guys were pretty bad, and then I found out that the singer wears makeup and has hair extentions. Now I think they're bad and I think they're a bunch of phonies."
1,Recovering,"Instead of titling this disc ""recovering the sattelites"" they should have titled it ""recovering my bald head."""
1,FAKE HAIR,I heard that Duritz takes his hair extentions down to some trendy club in LA and gets behind the bar and pours drinks to slobbering alcoholics. The guy has a charmed life and a fat bank acount. Why doesn't he do some charity work instead of being miserable and hanging out with actresses? Why doesn't he do something worthwhile for a change instead of moping around with his fake hair?
5,My First Counting Crows CD,"What a surprise to listen to almost every song on this CD was worth having. I've had this for a while but wanted to come in and give my 2 cents ""A Long December"" was the reason for buying it but ""Miller's Angels"", ""Another Horsedreamer's Dream"" and ""Daylight Fading"" quickly became my favorites as well."
5,Best Crows CD,"I am a big Crows fan and have purchased many of their cds...most of which are more recent than this one. I was just doing a search for another cd and this old classic came up. Recovering the Satellites in my opinion is the best album they have made. If you are wondering which CD of the Crows to try, make it this one. It represents them the best and the music makes for great listening."
5,For A Moment Of Time...,"Counting Crows sophomore release, Recovering The Sattelites, may not be August and Everything After, but in many ways, it's superior. August had great movement, but the band was barely getting to know each other at that point. Recovering, they've been playing together for years, so now they are all heading down a less experimental style, for an edgier, more meaningful album. Recovering The Sattelites is the journey of the band, but more than that, is the journey of our lives, because things get bad, they get worse, and then, they get better. We all make a lifetime commitment to recovering the sattelites, because no matter how high you rise above the clouds, everyone come crashing down eventually. This is an album about crashing down, and then doing the most important thing, getting up. It's beautiful, because it's real."
4,Gets Creativity Flowing,"Gave me great ideas on involving families, setting up my classroom and setting developmental goals for children."
4,"Expensive, but worth it",This sort of music is rare these days. The melodies evoke a 1920s/Art Deco/Great Gatsby-era feeling.
5,Exceptional Work,This book explains the psychiatric phenomenon of Dissociative Identity Disorder (once called Multiple Personality Disorder) exceptionally well. This book should be mandatory for future psychiatrists. It helps demystify the actual mechanics of this much-sensationalized but really very sad condition.
4,clarity and support,"When I read Dr, Steinberg's book it helped crystalize some ideas i had been having about my husbands erratic behavior, It was enlightening and gave me hope. Dr, steinberg agreed to evaluate my husband herself. i thought she was an intelligent and sensitive clincian."
1,Harmful 'how to' guide,"This book is like a 'how to' guide for creating dissociative identity disorder DID, a very bad thing. A lot has been learned in the 12 years since it was written, and like ""The Courage to Heal"", this book should be banned from circulation."
1,Is this book accurate?,"It sure sounded as though it was. However, after reading it I have found in too many places that this book is a fraud and a very old technique is suggested to help with derealization/depersonalization.I do not know who is honest and who is not. I do know that the symptoms in this book closely related mine if not exact! Too bad the treatment is outdated :-("
2,Sugartooth - 'Sounds Of Solid' (DGC Records),"Gone,reportedly is the Sabbath feel the trio had on their previous self-titled debut release.I couldn't say for sure,as this was the first Sugartooth CD I've ever heard.Guess the trio had decided for an overall new sound.Sorry to admit that 'Sounds Of Solid'(their 2nd of two discs)simply didn't do much for me.Some of the better tracks here,like ""Club Foot"",""Come On In"" and ""Toothless"" are okay.Line-up:Mark Hunter-guitar&vocals,Josh Blum-bass and Dusty Watson-drums.Possibly might appeal to fans of Helmet,C.O.C.,Stabbing Westward and Gravity Kills."
5,Stands the test of time,"This is still simply one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I have multiple copies and one never leaves my CD changer in my car. I can't think of another band that even sounds close to these guys, wish they were still around! Sadly, both CD's are out of print. Head over to Ebay and find a copy now!"
3,Soooooo different.,"This CD is not what I hoped it would be. However, it is still okay. Much of the music seems a bit contrived while other parts seem to be so raw and unrehearsed that it sounds like a recorded jam session. So it turns out that Sugartooth (I loved the first CD, probably in my top 10 ever) is another band that had a great debut, but was unable to put together enough material to have a great follow up."
1,"liked the first rec,this one is too soft","this cd was not hard i liked there old sound, sab rock rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Sugartooth,"The song Booty Street alone was worth the 4 star rating,It's a shame this album is out of print really good stuff here."
1,???,If you need a coaster for your drinks this is the c.d. to get! This c.d. is the WORST thing i have ever heard. DONT BUY THIS.
2,Piano needs tuning,"Interesting music. Definitely worth listening to. But the piano in the Sonata is desperately in need of tuning, which is a real shame because the performance is good. I'll wait for a live performance before I listen to this track again."
5,Couldn't STOP!,"When I first started this book, I thought it was pretty boring, but was determined to finish it. It got so very interesting as I got through it. Dr. Sparks is a really cool author and even though this is the first book I have read of hers, I know I will check out her other books. Sammy seemed like a true to life character at the beginning. The ending was kind of cheesy...because he forgives his father oh so suddenly...hmm...but other than that I thought I was one of the greatest books! Sammy is someone I greatly admire and I'm sure if you check out this book....you'll totally agree."
3,Almost Lost,"Well , I was sort of dissapointed with this book. I expected it to be a book about a kid on the streets not about a kid suffering through depression. He got through his depression way TOO fast. Even though I know that these sessions were once a week it just seemed he went from being suicidal to being happy way too fast. The whole have to be happy to be a good person just bothered me. I guess I expected too much from this book. Even though I didn't like it too well I would recommend it to others. It has some good tips about how to deal with unhappiness."
1,So unrealistic it's pathetic.,"This book seemed like it would be interesting when I first saw it. I had read many of the other books that Beatrice Sparks had ""edited"" and thought they were pretty good. (Even if she may have written them as some people think) But this book was horribly unrealistic.The phycologist was too cheesy, and the main character Sam was too happy despite his many problems. The point that set it over the edge for me was he ""hi-fived"" the phycologist because he was oh-so-happy to be able to talk to her. Real people that have just spent 3 months on the street after running away are not that suddenly happy.Take my advice, do not read this book!"
3,"Eh. ""Realistic""?","I looked foward to reading this book. It seemed very intereasting- suicide, life on the streets. I was wrong. As someone suicidal, I know it's not that easy to get over it. He says ""I'm sad"" and it's over? And he seemed to good to be true- so innocent and loveable. Isn't it illegal to tape theraphy sessions without consent, anyway?I did enjoy the Are You On The Road To Mental Illness Quizes, though."
1,more rah-rah than a cheerleader,"i started this book very optimistically and energetically. i was disappointed to find that sammy seemed to leap out of his depression and problems as if they weren't killing him. he seemed like a completely different person halfway through his session with the doctor. this seemed very unrealistic. is this the result of editing choices, or was this child really so easily pulled from a life on the streets to a happy normal teenager, only by focusing on positive thinking? it should have been made more clear at the beginning that the dr thought this was a mild case of depression. i suspect other teens might wonder why they can't leap out of debilitating, clinical depression with as much ease as the teenage sammy did. additionally, the italics were heavily overused, as was exclamation points. it was tiresome."
5,my reading book,"almost lost is a true story of an anonymous teenagers life on the streets. I like this book because I like to read books that are true like this book and the book named what happened to nancy. Almost lost is the real life story of a boy named Samuel. It tells what drove him to leave home, how hesurvived in the street, and why he was desperate to scape from the brutality of the gang that had become his family."
3,ok to a point,"I thought this book would be about the hard life out on the street, but it was the taped session with a counselor then everything was all hunky-dory. I should'nt have wasted my time. But it's not that bad."
2,No.,This book was terribly hard to follow... i dont know if its just me but the whole therepy tape style just wasnt working for me. Plus... it didnt seem real... the realationship between sammy and the lady just sounded so... fake and... like a cheesy script or something. i didnt really like the book.
3,ok...................but,THIS WAS OK BUT IT HAD ALOT OF OVER DRAMATISING FEATURES IN IT. I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING IT HAD ALOT OF MEANING TO IT BUT WAS WIERD. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SHRINK AND SAMMY WAS WEIRD. I DIDNT UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WOULD SAY GOOD MORNING SUNSHINNING SAMMY? THAT WAS WIERD TO ME THEY SEEMED ALOT CLOSER THAN WHAT THE BOOK TELLS.
2,too unrealistic,"When I first saw this book at Border's I thought it looked really interesting. I mean I can relate to the whole suicidal thing and depression. But as I read it, I was amazed at how fake and how unrealistic it was! People don't just get over it the way he did. I've been going to a psychiatrist for many years and I know nobody doesn't get over their problems that quickly. This book was WAY TOOO UNREALISTIC!!!!"
5,Dr. Sparks is Amazing,"I have read all but one of Dr. Sparks books and every single one has been astonishly moving. I am a teenage girl, and all of her books have really opened my eyes to real life issues. Almost Lost was in a different format than the others, because it was taped thearpy sessions, but I still loved it. It was like a free therapy session! It taught me that thinking positively is one of the most important things you can do in life. Her books also inspired me to start a journal of my own, and it is helping me so so much. I recommend this and all of her books to teenagers and anyone else looking for something really great to read and live by."
3,It was ok,"This was a good book, but it was kind of boring to me. All Sammy did throughout the book was go to a phsychiatrist's office. This book took me a very long time to read, not because I didn't like it but because it took place in a shrink's office. I didn't like how it was just recordings edited and put onto a piece of paper. I did like this book at the end, it's just that the beggining was hard to get into."
1,Plu-ease....,"I hated this book. I haven't even finished it, which is odd for me because I usually finish my books.But, really.The kid had more issues then me (and that's saying something) and was able to overcome them so quickly? And the exclamation points were so overused I felt like throwing up.When someone is as complementary as she was to Sammy, everything they say seems fake. It's like a random person that you don't know coming up and telling you how smart you are. They don't know you. They probably tell everyone they're smart. It means nothing.But, I guess if you're into sappy little feel good books, go ahead and read it. Maybe I'm just cynical."
2,This book is a complete waste of time,"Not to crush the authors dreams, but this book is a complete frustration! Throughout the book, the writing grabs the readers attention, however, after about 75 pages or so it really starts to drag. This kids story sounds like a real drama, but the writing style makes it feel like the author is trying to explain teenage gang violece to a four year old. I would not recommened this book."
3,Could Be Better,"This book seems very interesting at first glance. But once you start reading it you start to realise how very unrealistic it is, this does NOT seem like it is a true story. It's hard to believe that Sammy comes in depressed and angry the first day yet, seems excited and very willing to get over his problems the next. I was VERY disappointed with this book, the only thing that's the least bit interesting about it, is the story about Sammy's past which doesn't do very much for the whole book."
2,not what I expected,"I have string lights around my deck every year and these were by far the cheapest [and not in a good way] that I've ever bought. That's why it's hard to purchase from the internet, because you really can't see what your getting."
1,Cheap-o Cheap-o,"The beer lights are not a string but circular, with the cord feeding back into the plug. That's not such a big deal. However, the quality is poor at best. My first order although very well packed, came broken. The beer mugs are thin,hard plastic. Since there's no give whatsoever, they shatter.When I called to report the damage, the shipper was very courteous. I did not have to return the damaged product, and they immediately mailed another set. I can only hope this time they'll survive the post office."
5,Good little set of lights,They work great. I got them for my daughter and son-in-law and they like em. They go with their taste. :) They had the shotgun shell ones and I got these to go with the others and their life and taste. Work great and no problems.
4,uneven collection--shaffer and moore shine,"While not all the stories in this collection of Wisconsin fiction are first rate, two stories deserve this designation. Fans of Lorrie Moore will enjoy her contribution, ""The Jewish Hunter"", an engaging if dark love story. Ann Shaffer, a poet who has turned her attention to fiction, dazzles with her piece, ""Dropping the Baby."" Full of keen insight and humor, it will appeal to anyone who appreciates good writing. We look forward to hearing more from this author in the future!"
2,Too narrow!,"These boots look very nice, but unfortunately, they are way too narrow (and I have narrow feet). My whole foot felt squashed. Back to Amazon it goes!"
3,Good product!,Good product - fits well under my son's shoulder pads. Only issue was that we also bought theMcDavid™ Back Plate (EA)and the velcro straps didn't line up perfectly with the collar (I'm assuming because the collar is a large instead of a regular size). With a bit of work (just cutting a hole for the straps) it was easy to fit the back plate on. My son loves it and it makes him feel more confident in delivering (and taking) big hits. Makes me feel better knowing he's wearing it.
3,A mysterious stranger enters a diner and is accused of murder. He turns the tables and secrets are reveled. Just OK. I say C,"When a mysterious stranger (Madsen) enters a diner after news of a killing spree, secrets become revealed. After hearing about a brutal killing, a mysterious stranger comes in to a diner at closing time. The waitress and the six customers begin to think this stranger is the killer. After taking control of the situation the stranger begins to uncover secrets of the hostages. Not everyone is who they seem to be. This is yet another movie with a lot of potential but doesn't keep your attention. There are some pretty intense parts but overall pretty slow moving. It's not terrible but not a great first choice for nightly entertainment. I give it a C.Would I watch again? - No, this is a movie that doesn't get better with repeated viewings."
4,a good tense movie,"This film is better then I thought it would be. Its has tension and suspense. Most of the people in the diner are not who you think they are...Micheal Madsen character is sort of on the loose end side but he actually did'nt come into the diner looking for trouble, The people in the diner assume he was someone else and thats where the problems begin. a great performance by Micheal Madsen is the cherry on the top, he really holds your attention...all in all a very solid movie, NOT a academy award winner but a solid film."
3,OK - worth sitting through for the ending,"I thought the film dragged in parts and the acting not believable. I would watch Madsen in anything but it did seem a bit forced in this film. I did like the over-all concept of the film and the cinematography was excellent. Loved the close-up shots and the grittiness. I also think they failed to use Danny Trejo fully - he is great but just stuck in this movie as an afterthought. All that said, the climax was fantastic! ""I can count."" Best line ever."
2,It's OK,"Thank god I bought this on craigslist. It looks really cool but thats about it. The sheild is way too HEAVY. It just can't hold it on its own. The beam sabors can't be held in the hands unless you use glue. The jets are cool how they move independent of each other, but thats about it. I would probably pass on this one."
3,A good love story!,"The story of Nick Tanner and Wllie Winslow is not jam packed with adventure or mystery. Instead it is a story of two good people discovering each other against despite the challenges of life. The two primary characters are well drafted and easy to relate to. The secondary characters are a bit shallow, but then they do not play a significant part in the story. I recommend the book and plan to read other books by Ms. McMahon."
3,Great singers but...,"Yes, great singers, but mediocre pianists (most of them) - don't expect the refinement of Gage, Moore, Baldwin, Brendel, Johnson, et al. Recording sound is not always good. Nice, and given its price it won't hurt."
2,Saggy fold up seat,Was very uncomfortable as it sinks so far down in the middle when you sit on it. Heavier than I expected too.
5,A fine cup of smoky tea,"This Lapsang Souchong from Culinary Teas has a rich, complex flavor that surpasses quite a few other brands at a price that is comparable to or better than most. A pound of loose tea can take a while to get through, though, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking to try smoked tea for the first time. If you are already a fan of Lapsang Souchong and are looking for a satisfying cup, this is a great find."
3,Less smoky flavor than some other Lapsang Souchongs,"What first attracted me to the Lapsang Souchong variety of tea leaf is the distinct Latakia-like smoky flavor. This particular variety strikes me as unusually light on the smokiness. Granted my experience has so far been limited to the Twinings variety that comes in tea bags and the variety sold by Le Pain Quotidien bakeries. I thought that perhaps letting this tea steep a bit longer might help, but I've found that by the 5 minute point, the tea becomes disappointingly bitter and sour. I guess if you're looking for a more subtle, mild version of Lapsang Souchong this might be perfect."
4,Drip Filter,"Just received Katadyn drip filter it was everything advertised, nice sturdy plastic container with filters can't wait to try it out during spring camping trip."
4,Must have for emergency prep,"One of the most important considerations for emergency situations is clean water. I bought this Katadyn drip water filter to add to my emergency preparation supplies. As other reviewers have said, this filtering process seems to be rather slow (compared to a standard Brita filter, for example) but the end result is clean, safe drinking water.My intention is to use this should the water supply to my home be disrupted for any reason. Using rainwater harvesting I think I could make do with this for an extended period of time. The product seems to be well engineered and built. I'm glad to have this so that I could hunker down at home if I needed to rather than some FEMA or Red Cross shelter."
5,Simply Gorgeous.,Terry Kimbrough always has beautiful afghan patterns. I enjoy making afghans from her books because her instructions are easy to follow.
1,We're wasting time inside your mind,"This release of ""Metamorphosis"" from the Russian label CD Maximum adds 10 bonus tracks, many of which are basic tracks without overdubs, although Track 17 is a different version of ""Blue Turns To Grey"" than found on the ""December's Children"" album.With the exception of Track 14 ""Family"" (which should have received better treatment), this stuff is dreck. I see no reason to add more dreck by buying the CD Maximum version, which now commands 3 figures.A reviewer of another CD Maximum release thought these Russian CDs might be vinyl dubs. I own 4: ""USA Between The Buttons,"" ""Beggar's Banquet,"" ""Sticky Fingers,"" and ""Metamophosis."" None of the 4 are dubbed from vinyl. There's no indication on any of them as to the source of the tapes.If you're going to try one of the CD Maximum releases, don't buy this one. The mastering is quite good, but the music isn't."
3,"So, So...",I thought this would give me some insight to the Maui vacation weeks away. This DVD was really light on information. Just a glance over of the major highlights of each island. I feel I learned more from the Fodor's travel book I also read. I bought the used version because I couldn't find it for rent. I paid $10 but feel it's only worth $5.
4,Kilowog Action Figure,Product was great. I found it cheaper on the sellers website after I received it though.
5,When The Truth Rings Like A Bell,"I found the book to be incredibly powerful. For me, no other book has opened up the truths of the Bible more. Silent Killers Of The Faith is dripping with what real freedom in Christ looks like, and goes on to explain how to be truely free from the bondage so many Christians live in today. Thank you Steve Crosby for having the courage to write about such a controversial issue."
3,Indie obscurity reveals flaws and final material,"This Six track e.p was a limited Japanese import, and is one of the rarer items in Brit-pop.It feautures a decent cover of Psycho Killer, originally by Talking Heads, a couple of average remixes (one by Johnny Marr)and the last recorded material made available by the record company.These tracks were pretty good, and hinted the band might have had a prosperous future. Sadly it wasn't to be.They were dropped shortly after this release, and split.At a usual price of around 20, it's very much for Marion completists only. But it's rarity may make it a future holy grail, so it could also bee seen as an investment for collectors.Sparkle e.p-----------1. Sparkle2. Sparkle (Acoustic)3. The Present4. Journey To The Centre5. Psycho Killer6. Our Place7. Miyako Hideaway (The sushi soup vocal remix)"
5,Another of my 5-6 Christmas favorites!,"In short, this CD is fabulous! If you like choral music, Robert Shaw just does it perfectly in this CD. From the hushed entry of the voices over the distant bells in O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, through the exceptional Gloria in Excelsis, past the Et in Terra Pax (my personal Valium --the music takes you down and down until every muscle is limp--try it with earphones), to the Dona Nobis Pacem and Hallelujah, it's a glor-i-ous trip. (Unfortunately, the double-album version of this collection with twice as many pieces, entitled Nativity, no longer seems to be available.)"
1,Wang chung sucks wang chung,"how could anyone possibly like this? Music has only gotten progressively worse since Wang Chung's inception. Take my advice, don't waste your money."
5,LOVED IT,"I was looking for this CD for a long time and wasn't able to locate it anywhere else. Worth every cent I paid for the purchase and international shipping. I was really only looking for one track on the CD but the rest were a bonus. If you collect 80's music, this is a MUST HAVE! Excellent quality. Excellent turnaround time from the sellers."
1,Defective batch on a usually good product,"I have owned one of these gravity filters for over 8 years and have never had a problem. This unit sold at Amazon is the same one I've had all these years. We used ours overseas while doing missionary work.I ordered a new one recently from Amazon so we would have one while on furlough in the USA. Sadly I have returned two of them because the spout hole has been drilled too large. It's actually a bit oblong. It leaks if you don't tighten the spout down tight and leaks if you tighten it down because the washers collapse into the hole. I called Katadyn after the second time and asked for a new lower bucket with the correct size hole. They could not do this and told me to return it to Amazon.Amazon has been great with the first exchange and now the return. It's just too bad that they got a bad lot recently. Hopefully you won't get one that is defective like the ones I got. It is not supposed to leak around the spout. If it does, return it."
3,Bring on the boxsets...please!,My three boys and I love these cartoons but come on already WB...give us the whole seasons already!
5,Justice League - The Brave and the Bold,"Justice League cartoons are cool. To sum things up, why can't they just release all the Justice League season 1 and 2 episodes which I believe most countries have finish broastcasted on TVs? I believed that US is showing Justice League Unlimited and wow, we sure are behind time..."
2,I agree,I grew up with the superfriends and would like to own all episodes also. I found the first season with sixteen episodes at Overstock.com for $22.76 hurry they only have a limited amount. I would appreciate if someone locates other seasons post the location.
1,AWFUL!,This product is awful..Its very cheaply made and didn't work at all! Don't waste your money. And not a good size for looking in kids ears.
3,acu-life optical scope kit.,"This is one of two brands of scopes I have recently purchased for comparison. Though it was the more expensive of the two, it was not the better in quality, in that the battery casing for the pen light was made of cardboard and not a metal casing such as what was in the cheaper of the two. It was also difficult to get a clear view when looking through the scope."
3,Mixed Feelings,"The reference section for both XHTML and CSS are the best I have seen so far. I keep the book just for that on my desk. For this section I would give it 5 stars (and even more).However the tutorial section is bad as bad can be and full of mistakes. F.ex in chapter two there is a listing of an XHTML strict document but has the bgcolor attribute in the body tag. And so it goes on throughout the whole tutorial.If you need an excellent reference book shoot for this one, if you need a tutorial you better look for other books."
3,More than just Chicacgo blues,"Blistering piano work, clever songwriting and a unique vocal style. You hear Saydak's roots as a Chicago bluesman, but there's so much more..."
4,"I can't complain, but I will","As great as this Best Of is, and it IS great, if you are really interested in hearing ALL the best stuff, you owe it to yourself to pick up the Fossil Fuel 2CD set via import. It has every song present here, plus more that are quite indispensable. I did buy this CD, and loved it. Then I heard people talking about the import 2CD version, and decided to lay down the sheckles for it. What I found was perfection! There are SO many songs as good as or better than what is present on Upsy Daisy. So measure your desire to hear all the best that XTC has to offer, and don't be surprised if you buy this and end up trading up to the superior Fossil Fuel 2CD set!"
4,Lots of great songs,"This is a great album to buy if you don't own other XTC records. It really gives a great assortment of XTC songs. My one gripe, hence the 4-star rating instead of 5, is this: where's ""Super, Supergirl""?"
5,Nice collection,"This is a great collection of XTC songs. My only complaint is the fact that some of the lyrics on Respectable Street have been changed, apparently to make it ""less offensive""."
5,"Treasure trove of creatively crafted, intelligent pop tunes","I bought this CD for several radio hits I always liked in the '80s, and am pleasantly surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying the entire CD. Musically, this is a very solid album--both technically proficient and interesting/unusual in many places. I was disappointed that there were no lyrics included with the CD (though that's not uncommon for compilations), but looked them up on the 'net, and was impressed to find that their depth and intelligence matched the richness of the music. Some of the music is identifiably '80s, but I don't mean that as a criticism--XTC produced some of the best music of that era, and the songs in this collection stand up to the test of time admirably."
2,boring,"while it is scripture, which is nice,the authors tone is rather monotone,which makes it boring"
5,Great Teaching on Divine Healing,One of Bro.Hagin's many great teachings. Wonderful truths from God's Word that Healing is His will for us. Get one for yourself and anyone you know in need of Healing!
5,Give a toy that teaches a survival skill! (Beautifully!),"Sewing is so much more than a delightful skill to have, and it's way much more than a hobby to pass the time. Teach your child to sew, and down the road you have also educated and clothed a family, and saved them untold amounts of money as time goes by.This wonderful kit supplies your child with all that she/he needs to begin a sewing project immediately. There are lots of very easy projects, pre-cut patterns and a carrying case. You can start sewing right away!! It includes eight colors of embroidery floss, materials to make a notebook cover , materials to create little animals (and stuffing), trims, pins, pin cushion, and lots more.Once you open the box, you are prepared to get going without another trip to the store, and with time, your child can become an excellent crafts person with a needle. Use your imagination and just picture the custom-made wardrobe to come!"
3,"So,so","This item was O.k., for the fact that the embroidery thread was hard to pull through the fabric and hard to thread through the needle. This comes with a thimble, which has no use. The scissors could easily cut through the felt, so I don't know what other people were saying. The downside is that this is very frustrating for a child who is 6 and under and who is a first-time sewer. The material runs out very fast and so does the cotton. It is hard to stuff the animals. In my first attempt to try sewing, I ended up with an animal with the stuffing poking out. You could do a much better job by using a sewing machine. It took me 5 minutes to make one project, and I finished all the projects in an hour. (But the pincushion is very cute! We actually played hot potato with it! We took the pins out first!) Overall, this product is ok. I would recommend this if you are looking for something to get you started in sewing for you first-time sewers!"
2,Just OK,"this was very cute, but I wished the quality of the products inside were a little better. My daughter sewed on one eyeball and I had to do the rest of the cat. She hasn't picked this back up again."
3,Bad instructions,"I bought this for my Grand Daughter. I was trying to help her make one of the stuffed animals and the first time she tried to thread the needle, the threader broke. The papers had no real instructions as what to use for each animal or how to do it. I just had to look at the pictures and try to explain to her. Very little stuffing was included."
2,Shabby product.,"Children, like adults, need quality. If a child is trying to learn how to sew she/he needs products that are real quality so they won't get discouraged. I ended up buying scissors and needles to add to the ""kit.""Also, the case looked like it wouldn't hold up for 3 months!Just because children are novices doesn't mean they can't be inspired to learn!"
4,Other great sew kits for kids,"I like that this kit includes so much and especially the suitcase. However, when you try to offer everything, sometimes the quality is sacraficed. In this case the big problems are the needle, scissors and lack of instructions. Better, bite-sized starter kits like The Beansters offer one sewing project, step by step picture instructions for that project and contain a large-eyed, but sharp needle. These kits start with simple shapes and patterns, but the child can further develop their sewing skills with additional kits including accessories."
1,Don't buy this kit,"The thread is too thick for either of the two needles, the thread colors don't match the buttons, and so on. Your child will be very excited until they learn that the needles and thread don't work, and therefore the whole kit is useless. Catastrophic oversight, but so easy to fix, if they even cared. DO NOT BUY THIS."
4,A good first sewing kit,My 6 yo really enjoys this. She made a stuffed animal for a friend (with some adult help and guidance). Excellent activity. The case is not particularly well-constructed.
3,"Not for most 7 year olds, better for older kids","I bought this for my seven year old. I thought this kit would be more for kids. Turns out, the kit has all adult tools. The embroidery string does not fit through the needle provided. It's easy enough to split the string, but that step is not provided in the instructions, so my daughter did not understand why the string would not simply fit into the eye of the needle. If I knew that this was an adult kit with kid projects, I would have passed. I don't recommend this for kids under 10."
4,Pleased with Purchase,Bought this clock for a die-hard Packers fan for Christmas. He loved it and it is hanging in his game room.
2,"Great sound, but the cord makes horrible noise!!!!!","I just received these in the mail yesterday and I am already sending them back. These earphones do an excellent job of isolating any outside sound. Also, the bass is very resposnsive, while not overwhleming. However, the cord kept on making too much noise even when I would barely move. Whenever it tapped against my chest, it would start a vibrating sound that would run all the way up through the earphones. Even when I turned up the volume, I could still hear these vibrations. I would not recommend this product."
5,smooth and vibrant,"I was looking for a pair of earbuds to replace the originals from my ipod nano. While they worked fairly well, they did not stay in my ear very well, neither did they give me the tight and non-rattling base that I was searching for. After doing some research I chose the Sennheiser buds... and what a difference. Not only did they stay in place but the sound was outstanding...putting the unit in a class by itself. I heard notes never heard before on my ipod recordings. It seems as though the ipod and Sennheiser buds are a match made in heaven. And oh, that base!"
5,Sound and fit great!,"I bought these several months ago and have been using them almost every day since they arrived. Not only do they sound terrific, but they are surprisingly comfortable and do not fall out of your ears like the crappy earphones that come with most mp3 players nowadays (and they sound MUCH better). I have very small ears, and the smallest silicon adapter size fits perfectly and will not fall out on their own even when running. If you do use them for exercising outdoors make sure to watch out for cars because these headphones block out background noise and you won't hear them coming!"
5,I'm Shure about these earbuds,"Before you fork over $300+ to buy a set of Shure earphones, buds, etc. at least try the Sennheiser 300's.I have 6000 songs on my video iPod, I use my 'pod while I drive and as I relax before sleep. I bought my first, of many, iPod's when the 3rd generation came out and over time I've spent a lot of cash on new and better 'phones. You'll find that if you really love music you're searching for better and better sound out of your unit. I picked up a set of Shure 3c's at $349, the Sennheiser 300's preform as well, and you save a great deal.You can hear the lows on songs with range like Daniel Powter's ""Song 6"" so well you get chills.Consumer Report has a quick read on this model making the same recommendation as I have in comparison with the Shure pricey models.if you find you get sore ears from plugs or bugs, you get different pads with the 300 that will prevent that, while locking out many outside sounds.Enjoy, I'm out.....Steve"
5,Sennheiser CX300-B vs Sony MDX Earbuds,"I've been using the Sony MDX earbuds for about 3 years now. The primary use is with a San Disk MP3. Used this system for jogging and motorcycle riding. Until purchasing the Sennheiser's I thought the sound with the Sony's was ok. However, the Sony's wires are soft-coated and after a wind beating by riding the motorcycle, the coating desenigrated, leaving bare wires. I went through two pairs of the MDX and decided to try something else. Enter the Sennheiser's. Wow... what a difference in sound quality. These little babies have great base and more importantly, separation.. yes, I know this is the MP3, but, I never got it with the Sony's. Very happy with the Sennheiser CX300's... will buy a pair for my wife."
4,Was worth the order,"I got these in the mail and was excited to try them on. They fit pretty good, sometimes they'll get alittle loose in your ear, but nothing you can't fix real quick. The sound is really good, and full. For sure way better than the standard stock headphones. Worth the price, and all that."
4,Very Good Sound,Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)Good fidelity for such a small headphone. Good quality and comfortable.Excellent value for the price
3,sounds ok but design limits use,The only real problem is the short and asymetric cord length make their use very limited. Sound and fit are good.
4,"Excellent sound quality, but unconfortable for new earbuds users","Basically I love these earbuds. They sound awesome. Quite frankly, I've discovered tons of effects and notes in songs I had never heard before. Unfortunately, these are the very first earbuds I have ever used, so I really need getting used to have them practically inside my ear. Plus, it's true: you can hear the cable move when listening to your music, so joggers should have that in mind. It's however a very light noise."
3,"OK, but not great.","I bought this to replace the earbuds that came with my SanDisk Sensa. They work fine while sitting around listening, but I have tried all three sets of ear adapters while out running, walking or biking and none stay in my ear all that well. They filter out noise and sound good while they are in, but they keep loosening and need to be adjusted. Also, unless the cord is fastened to something to keep it from moving around, there is quite a bit of noise from the cord hitting against my body."
4,Pretty Good for the Money,"These are pretty good sounding earbuds, they don't fit my ears perfectley and I had to remove the tiny metal speaker covers because they would get clogged with wax (Yuck). For 20 bucks though, these are worth the money."
1,Doesn't fit the bill,"I purchased this headset to use with my first generation iPod, hoping for more comfortable listening and sound that's as good as my Sennheiser PX100 on the ear headphones. Yes, these are comfortable but the sound quality is awful, tinny, with barely a hint of bass at all. I would not recommend the set to anyone for any reason."
3,Good sound but limited use.,"The comfort and sound of these earbuds are good and they really do isolate the outside noise too. The problem, at least for me, is that when the chords are touched or I am breathing heavy (running/walking) the noise is echoed in the ears. Because of this, I do not recommend these for listening unless you are lounging or have limited movement."
2,"Great sound, but I'm iffy on the durability","I ordered these earbuds back in April of 2006. I was really, really impressed by the sound, and I couldn't believe that the price was this reasonable.But then last week, less than four months after I began using them, the sound in the right earbud lost about 98% of its power. It's all but dead, so now I have a monophonic listening experience. The earbuds were not dropped, pulled, yanked, or anything. I'm at a loss to explain it.I'm going to look into a warranty replacement, but even if that works, it's still a bummer to be without the earbuds for a while."
3,Great sound.... in fact too good!,"These are the most accurate, cleanest sounding headphones I've tried yet. They fit well and have great range. But I have 2 major complaints:1) They are so good, that I can hear my ipod. The ipod makes a buzzing noise that I can on all soft music or on pause. I don't need to hear the defects of my equipment, I just want to listen to music.2) They are worthless for exercising. I guess it is the nature of an in-ear monitor, but any movement in the cord is translated into sound. Just moving your head while sitting is annoying and transmits a loud rustling sound. These are pretty much only useful while stationary -- but if I am sitting, I would just use speakers!"
3,"Ok, if you listen to your iPod sitting on your arse",They sound ok. Good bass but distorted on some tracks. My biggest complaint is that they are unusable on the go. The sounds of the wires moving around and rubbing on your close can be heard clearly through the music. Very distracting.That being said they'll be nice to use for sitting on my arse.
3,Too much money,"The headphones have excellent sound, but as mentioned in the other reviews the length of the left wire is stupid. If you are planning on using these headphones for running, keep looking. They are great for cycling though. When you run they just fall out. Again best quality sound I've experienced, way too much money for what you get though."
2,Does not live up to the hype.,"These ear buds did block outside noise and fit well. However, the sound quality of the headphones is very poor. I would not recommend."
2,Buy the Shure E2c Instead,"Lost my Shure's on a plane, so I reordered these based on the reviews. Very disappointing. The cords on the earbuds are dramatically different lengths (why?), causing the earbuds to fall out and the cords to tangle. Earbuds don't nestle in the ear the way the Shure's do. Sound is OK, not great."
4,Great sound quality for the price,"I bought these for my friend and she loves them. I bought J-buds for myself, and I can definitely hear the difference in sound quality between the two. It would be great to have some noise canceling, though, but you need to pay a bit more for that."
4,Worth The $$,"Excellent sound, but you have to insert these correctly, like all in ear buds, to get the best bass response. I have listened to jazz, rock, blues, classical and instrumental guitar and these little buggers sound wonderful. It did take some experimentation with the soft rubber covers to get the best fit (3 sizes included). The cord noise mention in other posts is real and you can hear it, but I have gotten used to it. (cord noise can be minimized by placing the long cord around you neck and using a clamp (not included) to hold the cable snug on the front of your body). Overall I like these CX300's and would recommend them, especially for the price from tech4bargains via Amazon."
2,Disappointed,"Right and Left wires are not the same length? The wires are also not ""soft"" and do not lay/hang flat - really annoying! This causes a sound problem as any rubbing of the wires on each other, or anything else for that matter, is traslated into noise due to the sound deading fit. For me this was not acceptable. Back to my headphones."
4,It's good!,"It's good! But I found it's not so cheap comparing with CX300B, which is the same quality but the color is different."
2,Symmetrical cable!,Why is the description wrong??Great headphones but I wanted asymmetrical cable.There are only two (not three) different ear adapters too.
4,Really nice headphones. A good value (around $18 or so),"They are reasonably comfortable and deliver pretty good sound. I use them primarily when I'm flying on business, and they definitely deliver good sound. Am I ""blown away"" by them? No - but they are really nice. Just push them way in and you'll get good sound for the money. If you want really super headphones, then you'll need to spend a lot more."
3,Good but failed fast,"Enjoyed the sound quality but they already failed after only 7 months of owning them. The left bud volume is extremely low and I never listened to my music ""too loud"" or abused them in any way. I'm going to contact Sennheiser and have them fix/replace them but I'm real into my music and I need some more buds right now so I'll have to buy another pair in the mean time."
2,"Overstated treble, Poor fit","Just received these. Very disappointed in them. The treble is severely overstated and not in balance at all with midrange or bass. I got these for solely listening to music; however I found that their acute emphasis at the higher end lends itself well to the spoken word.Despite being packaged as bass heavy, unless you've got the earbud physically in your ear canal to the exclusion of all else, there isn't much bass to speak of, and what there is, is overwhelmed with irritatingly loud treble.Three earbud silicon adapters are provided. They are so thin and flimsy that even when conforming to my ear, they rapidly fold and the earbud falls out of my canal and ear!I think I'm going to pick up something else. If you are into music, I can't recommend these from the sound point of view, and if you have a lobe that doesn't fully support the earbud, then the soft adapters will not retain the bud at all."
4,Comfortable and sounds good,"Works fine with portable electronics -- no headphone amp required.Although not up to the standard of shure or etymotic, the price is right, the fit is not fussy, and the sound is fine."
5,Great Item,I am very happy with these earphones. The sound quality is great and if worn correctly the bass is great and keeps a lot of outside noises out.
4,They're good.,"All insulated earphones sound unnatural because they seal off the ear outside air, so the sound quality isn't as great. Other than that, these are fine. The purpose for these is for the sound isolation and it does that well. If you're into sound quality, get the Koss Portapros which are complete open-eared so there is no sound isolation at all, but sound great because they're like speakers on your ears."
3,a little weird feeling,"I am the first-time user for a in-ear headphone..... The feeling is a little bit weird for me, maybe my personal experiences... I hear my heart beating and breathe while I enjoy the music... And the bass for this earphone is not as good as I expect."
3,Spend a little more to get something better,"If, as Agaligo claims, these are the same as the Creative 'phones that appear to be identical (which are what I own), spend a little more and get some Shure e2cs or something, these headphones just don't sound that good. The mid-bass frequencies are absolutely overpowering and drown out any sort of detail. To make them even tolerable, I set my iPod to ""Bass Reducer"", which still ends up sounding pretty bad, but it results in at least a little flatter frequency response."
1,No sound quality,"I bought these thinking that maybe Sennheiser's expertise would deliver in a small form factor but quite simply, these are worse than the ear buds that came with my i-pod. Returned the product."
4,"Great product, snow interferred with delivery",Product great but got caught in our CO snowstorm and delivery was excruciating long.
4,Sennheiser CX 300S In-ear Monitor (Silver),"I researched all options available and the Sennheiser CX 300S seemed to provide the best value for the money. Great sound at a great price from such a small set of earbuds. The only item I have to get used to is the ""J"" cord. I still prefer both wires of the same lenght. Overall, I am very happy with the sound and the isolation provided by these tiny units."
3,"Good sound, poor ergonomics.....for my taste","The Sennheiser CX 300S headphones do sound good and noticeably more transparent than stock iPod headphones, however, I did not like the assymetric headphone leads. You are forced to place your iPod, or other device, on one side only. The headphone leads a very thin and have kinks all over from the way they were packaged. I liked the sound but not enough to deal with the other two issues. They were sent back."
3,OVERPRICED - fair ear phones but not at $$$$,"These ear pieces are okay. They have decent bass tones, an acceptable mid range, and have the noise reduction ear channel guards in three sizes making for a pretty good unit, but not at the price charged. The same quality can be found at Best Buy or Circuit City for about the same price but they include a carrying case. Further, this particular set has that irritating ""one ear line longer than the other"" feature, limiting the flexability of use. Overall - overpriced, you would get a better package retail!"
5,"Great sound, very good quality","This is an amazing piece of hardware. This is the first in-ear phones I have, and they feel good. Sound is perfect. As always, Sennheiser delivers another good product for a small price. This is my second Sennheiser, and I am not disappointed (I have a HD202 that I use on my desktop).Make sure you try all fitting rubbers. It can be a little awkward to find the right fit, specially if this is the first time you use in-ear phones. Once you find the right size, sound is great, phones stay put in the ear, no matter what.I'd buy it again. Make sure you get them when Amazon has it on sale for $39.99"
2,OK IM DONE,"I LOVE THE SOUND BUT I HATE THE QUALITY. THESE HEADPHONES LAST ME 3 MONTH'S, IV BOUGHT THESE 4 TIMES BUT EVERY TIME THEY I BUY A NEW PAIR.I HATE THE BREAK DOWN, I HATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY LAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
2,Best for an asymmetrical person,"I liked the ear fit - three sizes are provided and I liked the sound, really sharp and powerful.However ...The asymmetrical cable is awkward and is a bother. From the yoke (where the bud cables separate) the left ear bud cable is 7-1/2"" in length. The right side bud cable is 21"" long. That's quite a difference. The CX-300 is designed to be worn behind your head.I wish the cable measurements had been printed on the package!!I wrote Sennheiser if it was possible to it send back and have it modified to a symmetrical length. Their answer was to consider their CX55, CX400 and CX500 if I wanted symmetrical cables."
3,Comfortable but not great sound,"Bought these to replace my lost Shure e2c's.Pros: Comfy. 4 hour flights with no issues. Cheaper than the Shure e2c'sCons: Too much bass. Sound quality is below that of the e2c's. Cord is cheap and thin. No cord case. Asymmetric cord is also awkward.If I could go back, I would go with the Shure's."
3,Watchout- the cord design may not suit your needs,"The Good- Comfortable, lightweight earbuds- Decent sound quality for the price, much better than Apples stock earbuds, but still a bit tinny sounding and lacking bass for true audiophilesThe Bad- Asymetrical cord design doesn't work for me AT ALL.I ran the cord around the back of my neck as others indicated. I ""guess"" I can see what the engineers were getting at with this ""ergonomic"" design, but it doesn't work for me. While I'm jogging, the much shorter left cord tends to snag on the back of my neck, especially as I perspire; when I turn my head, the left earpiece tugs out of my left ear canal- very annoying. I've tried jogging with the cord in front, but the much longer right sided cord flops all over the place and the left ear bud ends up tugging uncomfortably on my ear. I suppose if you don't jog or workout with these headphones then you'll be alright."
4,Solid Phones,"First off, the only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is because I had switch out the Sennheiser bud tips for my old Sony MDR-EX71s. The Sennheiser tips created an uncomfortable suction inside my ear canal.Sound is awesome. I'd equate the bass to having a subwoofer in your mouth...but the full range is no punk either. The cord is just long enough to have your player in pocket and comfortably wear the 300s; preferably left pocket since that's the short side of the line. Any more movement than a casual walk and you may want to invest in a short extension, or clip your player somewhere above waist level.Listening to KMFDM - ""Juke Joint Jezebel"" @ half volume"
3,"good sound, bad design","the sound on these earbuds is great, but what difference does that make if the design is bad?? whoever at sennheiser came up with the idea of uneven earbud cords has obviously never worn any. i bought these to replace my dying earbuds that came w/ my nano, but now i wish i had just bought another paid of the apple earbuds to replace them. you look like an idiot if you wear these at your desk at work or when using your macbook because the chord looks fine on the left side and then there's all this excess cord around your neck. if these things had a normal cord setup like the apple earbuds, i'd be giving these 4 or 5 stars. i just wish i had done more research to find this out before i bought them. so, for all those looking for some great earbuds, keep looking for some with a better cord setup."
4,Sennheiser CX 300S In-ear Monitor Silver,Pros:-Comfortable to wear.-Great sound isolation.-Good bass.Cons:-Lack of resolution and clarity in mid and high range (comparing with my HD477)Overall a solid product for the price.
2,Poor sound quality,The sound quality is way below what I expected for Sennheiser. Little or no bass - even after adjusting and changing ear cushions.
4,Great knife.,"This is a fantastic carving knife, it slices with great ease through cooked meats, regarldess of texture. Edge is extremely sharp and maintains with great ease."
5,Dr. Mom,"Having been told that there was no direct relationship between epilepsy and language, learning and behavior complications, I was thrilled to find a source for all of the information I had suspected was true and valid.It was well worth the high price tag.I suspect it will come in handy again when my kindergartener reaches grade school and I need to explain exactly what is happening in her brain and why and how she needs special assistance."
5,Songs of Hope,"My mother passed away in 2010 and If You Could See Me Now from the CD, God Will Make a Way: Songs of Hope, was played at her funeral. Even though my mother left this world, I know she is walking on streets of gold and that gives me hope. Every song on this CD is beautiful and inspirational."
4,Good Game...,My daughter loves Eragon and I knew she'd love this so I bought it for her. It is exciting and a great addtion to her psp games. It has many levels and great graphics.
3,Eragon PSP Game,"The game was sent to me like it was brand new, although it had been used. I thank the sender. But playing it was another story. I was expecting to be able to play as Eragon, but you only play as Sefeira, so you are constantly flying, helping Eragon shoot arrows, and eating animals/people to stay alive. Not as fun as I thought it would be."
3,Just OK,This really doesn't have a strong chocolate flavor and I'm not sold on the taste or consistency at all. We'll use it but I wouldn't purchase it again.
4,Revenge Is So Sweet!,"Loved it, great foreshadowing, nice plot lines, and revenge was sweet. I had expected a different motivation from the main character, but seeing the one couples lost son was enough. I only did not catch it. I think the ending was poetic. The director left the impression that both were parting ways, yet they seemed to be leaving at the same time. Hmm, what was in their minds?"
3,It's free therefore it's formated badly,"Ok I have a new computer and I've been ripping CD's for days. So I got unbox and downloaded a free movie, cool. Well not cool I play it in the unbox player and the film looks like it was shot all above the waist. I don't understand how this ""The Bank"" came out where half the movie is not visable. WTF! Ok I guess that's the last time I download a free copy I mean who am I going to complain too, it was free.== Addendum ==Unbox is 32 bit and doesn't play well in 64 bit OS. Watch the movie instantly and no problem works fine."
4,A Tightly Wrought Tale of Greed and Revenge,"THE BANK is another Australian movie that demonstrates how sophisticated 'foreign' films can be. Robert Connolly directs this tale of corruption with breakneck speed, leaving little time for catching a breath much less understanding the heavily accented dialogue (no English subtitles available on this DVD and many conversations are lost because of the thick Aussie accents by some of the actors). Anthony LaPaglia is the devil incarnate and David Wenham as the new PhD in mathematics who can drive LaPaglia's scheming to disastrous ends. Both are excellent as are the other cast members. The music score by Alan Jones is superb (listen carefully to the boys choral writing) and the graphics are top notch. Not a great movie but a thoroughly entertaining, edge of your seat, wizardlike video game - one in which you as viewer can surmise all the moves."
1,Waste of money,"This is just an out of date regurgutation of what is already on the net, you are better off printing it out and putting it in a three ring binder if you have to have paper."
4,Aren't You Glad You're Not A Muslim Woman?,"This book explains the choices that Muslim women make when faced with the encroaching modern world. Still a valuable reference book, even though it is out-of-date."
4,Death by accident,"This impressive little book has 9 stories that are loosely connected. Main character is a German soldier called Feinhals and the stories mostly deal with the latter days of the war in Hungary and how the Germans cope.There's a lot of death and disaster, mostly through stupid accidents. A stray bomb unfortunately detonates, a woman is shot because she sings beautifully but is a blond, catholic jew (which is incomprehensible for one soldier).Feinhals himself also reaches a bitter end, much like in ""Das Boot"".Good book, also good to read about the German side of the second world war, and B?ll was a soldier on the eastern front himself."
2,Hard to use in a tutoring situation.,"I bought this to supplement Language Arts. I think I use the middle school one more than the high school. Actually, I don't think I've used the high school one at all."
2,Not what I expected.,"I first want to say that I really wanted to like this product. Well, it did not turn out that way. I was expecting more out of the product. I was using the math and pretty much it was a lecture, a very small lecture. You don't do any problems to see if you actually had an understanding of the concepts. I was disappointed. I felt that I should of gotten a book instead of this product. I have not tried any of the other subjects because to me the math part was so disappointing that I did not want to waste time with the rest. I gave them two stars because I did not see the other subjects. Sorry, I wished I could give this product a good rating.:("
4,-I- like it,I like it but my wife and sons don't. My wife and oldest son found errors in the math tests and had no desire to look at the information beyond. It has some great ideas for study and organization. I have found it interesting to listen to some of the lectures. It does not provide enough guidance and help in transfering audio files to an mp3 player.
1,Very Dissappointed,"I ordered this product from Hi-Tech Savings,2250 Homecrest Ave. Brooklyn,NY 11229.through amazon.comHowever I never received a CTA Digital Battery charger instead I received a different brand charger,when I removed the charger from the packet something inside the charger was shaking,when I plugged on the charger to charge batteries, the charger's red light never turned green and charger became hot.I complained to the company and they promised to reply to my complaint but never they did - I have never gotten any explanation for the malfunctioning and incorrect battery charger.I don't think I will be purchasing anything on amazon.com I a very skeptical and turned off by this transaction."
5,Great product,"This is great, not only can you use it overseas as well - the batteries are of good quality and you really can't beat the price."
5,I love the big bluse hearts!,"The Big Blue Hearts sound as good on stage as they do in the studio, how do I know this one of the members is my cousin. They are so nice and polite they give rock and roll a better name. I listen to this cd every day and imajine myself somewhere away from all civiliazation in love with my J.C."
4,A Great Find,"I heard a little of ""Stay Awhile"" in a movie and then bought the CD. I am really enjoying it. One song is too Chris Issac for my taste, but I love the rest. They have kind of a bluesy, country with a little bit of rock feel. Good lyrics."
1,boooorrriiiiiiing!,"I've been listening to rock & roll since I was barely walking, and I have to say that this album is weak. I like old Blasters and X, as well as Elvis etc. My mom owns it, and I borrowed it to listen to w/ my friends, they all hated it.Now I know why she paid only a few dollars for it.----Brandon (BLUES FAN)"
3,not really crunk,sounds to gangster rap.not what I expected a crunk CD to be.Being a dancer and studying dance appreciation I would not relate this whole compliation to the crunk style
5,Plus perfect,"Surpassed expectationsOrdered another for fellow competitor its a great Order one for yourself, its a great addition to my game"
1,A disappointment,"A deeply disappointing book that is for the most part worthless. The core text is less than 200 pages of fairly large print, padded out with a glossary that defines such terms as ""derivative"", ""equity"" and ""exchange"". Except for the first chapter the book is an introduction to software and product management with little or no mention of its applications to financial operations. There is no mention of ATSs, ECNs, automated trading, let alone direct market access or algorithmic trading. Even basic topics such as straight-through processing are only talked about in the most cursory of fashion. I could not recommend this book to anyone."
3,slightly disillusioned,"FitSmart Shake, Chocolate - Not as tasty as Citrucil chocolate fiber shake, but for some reason that is not available anywhere currently. Also, FitSmart has 3 times the calories."
5,Fitsmart Chocolate Shake,"I have tried many different protein powders but this is the only one I will ever use. First, the taste is wonderful. I either add a banana or a tablespoon of peanut butter and some ice. I also add one packet of stevia.The shake takes care of my hunger and it has really made me regular. It is loaded with all the right nutrients, including D3 which is the most important D vitamin. I like that it has digestive enzymes and all the rightnutrients. Brenda Watson's products are so good. She knows what it takes to make people healthy."
2,Overrated,"I couldn't figure out why Silverberg's Majipoor was included among the series that were lauded in the Legends Anthology that Tor put out a few years ago. While the others were all unmistakably fantasy series, Majipoor is clearly science fiction. On top of that, despite being an old timer, Silverberg himself is no legend, except in his own mind. Seeing him with the likes of King and Jordan was laughable. Then I looked more closely and realized he was the editor. AHhhhhhhh.The same sort of this shines here. A once decent, if not remarkable, series is being plumbed again, in the hope that it will produce another gusher. Sadly, the well is dry. This promises to be the conclusion, and I can only hope that it is, but the ending was amateurish at best, and I can't really say I will miss the world."
3,An okay game...,"This game is pretty fun at first, but it's very slow and you can't do much. Don't waste your money. I've read some reviews on here that say it's impossible to teach the dog anything, but that's not true. I'm 13 and I've taught my dog tons of tricks. Best for people with patience."
1,no puppy luv,This game is rather boring. My seven year old was anxious to buy this game and it is not at all what we expected. We can not get the dog to do anything nor are there explanations as to how to figure it out. If there are better games out there I would like to know
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This software was a waste of money! Got this for our 10 yr old daughter for Christmas (she had requested it) - we can't get the puppies to do anything! It will sit for a millisecond - you can buy accessories but can't use them - but you can feed and water it, brush it and ""wash it"" (mearly bubbles that show up on your screen). There are glitches in the software program that you have to download a patch for - which took over 2 hours with a dial-up connection - and even then it did not address our problems. She actually had two different puppies ""walk"" off the screen and can only see them now if she takes them for a walk - how sad is that to ""lose"" a virtual pet??? (Funny really - but still!) You can change your screen settings from 3D to full screen which is also supposed to address any problems you may have with viewing, but this did not fix the problem either. You can download a version of this game, I don't know if that's better than the software version or not. Good luck!"
1,NOT SO GREAT,"This game is very difficult to play . has alot of gliches, you have to keep buying food and water to feed your dog, well before you know it its all gone and you have to go to the pet store again, I tried to help my granddaughter get the dog to do tricks and its literally impossible, all it will do is sit. I can not make it do anything else I have tried everything and I am 49 years old, so how can a child be expected to learn the dog tricks. I still can't figure out how it is suppose to get sleep zzzz, or get him to go in the dog house. The game is frustrating for any child."
1,Couldn't Get it to Work,"I bought this game and never could get it to work. I tried everything and this is the only game that has ever done that. I have Windows XP, and it just kept saying that it could not install.I took it back and decided to get something else that would work. I got Fairy Godmother Tycoon and it is the BEST game. I don't regret my decision at all, and there is so much to this game."
1,dont get it!,"let me put it to you in two words, very boring! i played this game on a demo on the internet and was i glad i didnt purchase it , all you do is feed the dog and throw toys to it and when you call it you have to click on call and a recognition voice says "" come here girl"" and that is all it says all i kept thinking the whole time was is this all it is ? it was so boring that i just opted myself out of the game . if you wanna try it out play the demo first ,other wise youll waste your money."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I played this game on yahoo (A demo) and didnt liked it at all. it is very boring. When you go on a walk, you dont even do anything. just watch your dog walk for 30 seconds and pee. the toys are boring and the contests are VERY easy to win. sometimes all you do i click and it gives u points for no reason! so its really easy getting money and buying your pet things. when u play with your dog the toys do the SAME FREAKING thing every time! wont change at all! the ball/frisbee goes the same direction everytime! the dog catches the same way every time. it makes u bored very soon. i suggest u get dogz or catz for pc. or even nintendogs for DS. anything is better and more funner than this!"
2,What a mistake,"Yep, It was a mistake to buy these struts for my V70 Volvo.The car now handles as on railroad tracks. Very lil roll, very stable when cornering.The problem is that the car now rides like a truck. Every lil bump on the road can be felt, just as if you had over inflated your tires. Bigger bumps and potholes are handled beautifully.Will try to get my money back under the Monroe Ride Guarantee.July 12th, 2011 Update:I finally got the OEM struts to replace the Monroes. I got the nice Volvo ride back!!!.These Monroe struts are gas filled. The OEM Sachs are not."
4,great price for a touring car,Best price I could find anywhere all though its a good strut not one that's made for that sports car feeling for that use a more high performance strut.
2,There is a problem,"This thing only holds space for normal-sized single DVD's. So, if you're looking for a place to keep your season sets of whatever television show you have on DVD, you can't do it with this thing."
1,not described correctly,First thing to know that they do not play sounds....none of them! I called the company and they removed the sounds from all wallables even though they have it on the website. Also the sticky back is falling off and I have only had it 2 days. It is just an overpriced large foam decoration you could get anywhere.
3,CUTE ..... BUT.........,I thought this would be cute for my son's room...it is...But...it doesn't glow at all and the music isn't loud enough for any one to really hear...not at all what I expected...it does brighten up the room....but it's not what I intended it to do...
5,"All The Hits, And Then Some","OK, so she's a saxophone playing school teacher who made it big in the early 80's. Aside from that, this is an awesome CD! No 80's collection is complete without it. And for the record, or is it CD, this disc has the full version of 'Find Another Fool'. I've heard of some 80's compilations that fade it out toward the end. That's not the case here. All the songs are the original hits as they appeared on their original albums back in the early 80's. No rerecords or editing here. All of the well known hits are here. If you are a fan of the early 80's music as I am. You had better grab this one before it's out of print. These tracks still sound as great as they did when they were new. It makes me long for the days when the music, the hair, and the hits were really big."
4,"Where is ""Williams Avenue""?","Very cool collection, but how could they possibly leave ""Williams Avenue"" (one of their best songs in my humble opinion) off of this disc? Quarterflash certainly found a little niche with their distinctive infusion of jazz, funk, rock and sultry vocals. A very tight and versatile band. Too bad they did not have a few more offerings for us to sample. In any event, this disc is well worth the investment."
1,Snore snore,"""Harden My Heart"" was a huge hit single in late 1981. It is standard MOR fare, heard today on shopping mall sound systems across America.What is astonishing is that this band managed to, albeit briefly, make a career out of recording this same song over and over. ""Take me To Heart,"" and ""Right Kind of Love,"" for example, are almost paint by numbers duplicates. The public bought it for a while but then wised up, and this snooze of a band has not been heard from since."
3,Not quite ready for prime time,"I realize that technology is an imperfect science and that vendors are in a life and death race to be the first to get their products to market. Nevertheless, I am getting tired of buying products that aren't quite ready for market, and often need to go through multiple firmware upgrades before they work as they should. Here's another one that falls into that category. After enduring several months of randomly dropped connections whenever I closed the lid on my laptop, the router finally seems to be fairly stable. I've gone through at least two firmware upgrades since purchasing the router about 3 mos. ago.The coverage area of the router is generally quite acceptable, covering my two story, 4000 square foot home pretty well. Unlike Linksys and some of the other router manufacturers, NetGear limits their tech support to just 90 days after purchase. As a result, it's important to figure out the router's indiosyncracies quickly, otherwise you're on your own."
1,Another Dead Router,"Like many who've posted about this product, my WNR854T also died to the infamous ""single green power indicator light"" problem after about 5 months of use. It's great while it works. When it dies, however, no amount of power cycling, resetting, or coaxing will bring this router back. The customer service is poor at best and Netgear will make you pay for at least shipping even if you are within the warranty period. Not only that, they will replace your unit with a refurbished unit which is also prone to the same failure within a few months of use until you fall outside of the warranty period. Save yourself the headache and the money. Get your some other router."
1,"Chad, give it time and it will fail.","Please do not buy one of these Netgear routers. I purchased two of these, one for my small office and one for home. Loved the gigabit and the nice design.Now after about nine months both routers have suffered what is referred to as the green light of death. The router just stops one day and the only light that will come on is the green power light. That was my office unit, then 4-5 weeks later my home router suffered the same fate.Netgear wants a premium to get a replacement POS unit in a decent amount of time. Unless you are fluent in engrish, tech support is difficult to understand. They will insist you push that damn reset button forever.I have used Netgear and Linksys products over the years without problem, until now. Very disappointed. I guess I will have to keep my old hardware for backup. Unbelievable."
1,"Doorstop, like all the others","Yep, mine died a few months ago with the same issues as everyone else. Instead of wasting my time on the phone with Netgear I'm just chalking up to lesson-learned.I'll probably buy whatever wifi is available at Costco because of their fabulous return policy if anything happens."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ROUTER,"I have one of these Netgear bookends and it died a couple weeks after the one year warranty ran out. I contacted Netgear via email through their website and their response was ""too bad for you"". I can't understand why they won't take the thing off the market. It was the most expensive router I've purchased and to have such a short life and apparently uncaring manufacturer's reps is unforgivable to me. I won't ever buy another Netgear product."
1,Green Light of Death,"I'm not the type to complain or write reviews, but this will be the last time I will ever consider Netgear. So far I have tried 3 different routers of theirs and so far I have been disappointed 3 different times. I unfortunately did not check the reviews for this router before buying it and now find my router happily dead.From now on I will stick with Linksys. I have had issue with their products but never to the extent I have had with Netgear."
1,"I'll be darned. Their right, it breaks in 3-6 months.","Well, bought it at compusa and just like a lot of other people are saying, the thing died within 1/2 year. Wish I had checked here first."
2,Router bit the dust,I used my computer last night and went out for the evening. I came home and my router had bit the dust. I have had this router for 10 months. Add me to the list of unhappy campers. I will not bother trying to get Netgear to replace this product. I am glad I read the reviews before going to the store to get another one of these. I will research and find another brand with better customer satisfaction.
3,Netgear router N,"The router works well now but there were some problems getting the firmware updated. It's a good product, but if I were purchasing now I would make sure the firmware is already updated. It looks like Netgear rushed this to market.I am happy with the end result, however."
2,Good router that doesn't last,"The Netgear RangeMax WNR854T was easy to set up and worked flawlessly for a couple of years, but it stopped working suddenly. My Netgear type b is still kicking, so it's not necessarily the company. Although a power surge might have fried it without me noticing, this was a relatively early wireless N offering, and I don't think they had it right, yet."
2,Outdated with New Win OS,"I gave it two stars for working for many years - I've actually had it for five years! But I woke up one morning with my newer windows os laptop which now automatically updates windows for me, and with the new windows updates during the night my Netgear router decided it isn't compatible anymore. And since I can't connect it, I can't update the firmware. I've exhausted myself trying to fix this, and now am tired of it. I thought with a router this good I should spend time trying to fix it, but I give up. I can't even get the lights to turn on now so I'm wondering if the lights are broken after reading some of the other reviews. Maybe I should have given it more stars for the many good years I've had, but the tech support informed me I can only use their live chat support for three months & I'm downgraded to ticket support now. What? Whatever."
1,JK,"Please do yourself a favor. Do not buy this product.As previous reviewers noted, this product goes dead after about 6 months. I already replaced one because it was within the warranty period. And yesterday it went out again. I called their customer service, but the guy told me I cannot get a replacement because I am out of the original warranty period.I did not know this router has a problem they cannot fix and wont do anything about it. This is not an isolated problem as you can read in many previous reviews. Please do not buy it and any other product from this company. And spread the word to your friends and family members. They should be punished for marketing this defective product and refusing to address the problems of consumers who bought this junk."
2,Netgear WNR854T RangeMax NEXT Wireless Router Gigabit Edition,"I found that the new Netgear has DHCP issues, other than that it's an ok Wireless router for the home."
5,Great Product,"The WNR854T is an excellent wireless router, and when the matching WN511T wireless card is installed, it really provides a laptop with superior connect and operating speeds.On the wire LANS side of the world, with the 1 Gigabit cards installed, the router provides far superior LANS/network speeds.Although they, like many manufacturers, out source their tech support, Newgear's functions appears better than most other similar supports functions that I have had the occasion to utilize in the past."
5,"Excellent, couldn't be happier","I bought this router when I purchased my new laptop. I got a Dell laptop with the Intel Wireless-N technology. This Netgear router is specifically designed to work with the Intel Wireless-N, but we have had great luck with my wife's laptop which uses an older wireless format. The setup of this router was fairly easy. I would highly recommend this router if you are going to make the move to wireless-N technology. We have no deadspots in our 3300 square foot house. We keep the router in a closet in my son's bedroom and I use my laptop in my bedroom all the time. The rooms are on opposite sides of the house, with several walls in between...My computer usually registers between 90% and 100% signal strength. If you want to pay the extra cost for this router, I think you will be very happy that you did."
1,DO NOT BUY THE NETGEAR WNR854T,"DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER.DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER.DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER.OH, AND ONE MORE THING...DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!"
1,Another dead one,"I upgraded from a Linksys 802.11b wireless router to this model. Setup was a snap, and I get a 3X increase in download speed to my home PC connected via wire (not a wireless connection) over my Optimum Online cable service. This alone was worth the cost to me. The boost when I'm wireless is great too. Another huge improvement is that I had to reset the Linksys router every other day or so, because the wireless access would not work after a day or so. This new Netgear router just keeps working. It's been about 6 weeks now without a reset. I am a totally satisfied customer....BUT after a couple years my router died too.. just like all of the other people who've reported that their router died. So I guess this was a bad choice. I do not recommend you buy this product. I will never buy another Netgear product."
1,Disaster. Unstable.,First I bought was broken. Customer service is a disaster. Vey unstable. Need daily restart. There is no firemware update since 2009.Don't buy it!
1,dead after one year,"This router had pretty strong signal, but after about one year it started to drop the wireless connections every hour or so. Then after a few more agonizing weeks it died completely, with the power light being on, but nothing else working."
1,Dead in 5 months,Not the power supply. I tried it with several others and the router just keeps rebooting. When it worked it was great - easy to setup and all the features you could need.
1,Severe design issue,I have to admit I didn't believe any of the bad reviews and bought the router. It worked fine for 6 month before it went dead and only the green power light works. Search and you will find 100s with the same problem online. The Netgear support does know about the issue but has no solution. You get the offer to purchase premium support for min $65 for the next 6 month but this will not fix the issue.As there is no solution if you pay for a new one you will get the same issue again after some month. Therefore the best solution may be to stick to a company that sells you a working unit and the proper support for it.
1,Inherent defect in this product,"This is my second try. The first stopped its wireless function after 10 months. This second one has now gone 15, but stopped transmitting wireless signal yesterday. Looking at other reviews, you can see that there is a problem with this product. I cannot say anything about their other routers, but if you value reliability this one should be avoided.Late breaking news: On a lark, I updated the firmware (the cat 5 ports on the router still work) on March 24, 2009, and, voila, the wireless started working again! I find this almost incredible, and cannot imagine how it can be explained other than by a nefarious code that purposely was set to disable the wireless after a certain period! Talk about 'planned obsolescence'. Needless to say, this does not change my overall opinion of this router, but it does add a strong negative tint to the entire product line."
1,Another one bites the dust....,"My second WNR854T died just like the first one did. Suddenly without warning, poof! No internet connection, all hell breaks loose, and lo and behold just the one yellow power light is struggling to stay on. Same issue 8 months ago, and that one was a little over a year old. I guess this is a common burn-out issue. The ONLY reason I started on this NETGEAR path was because the unit was one of the few that had built-in gigabit connections, AND the price (of course) was right. Since then, I've been able to take the defective unit back and swap it out without doling out more bucks. If I had to pay anything, I would look for another manufacturer, like D-Link or Linksys. This unit is on sale at Frys right now for $109, so in a bind I swapped it out for a new one HOPING they have fixed the DEFECT. Isn't it nice to be part of the R&D team of guinea pigs for Netgear? Still waiting for my paycheck from them....."
1,Dont Buy This,"After 6 months started to fail on occasion, but could be fixed by rebooting. After 7 months it failed completely as others have described. I replaced it with my 4 year old WGR614 and it still worked fine, just slower."
1,This router died after 4 months!,"Same problem as previous poster. One day I got home from work and only the power light was lit. No network activity lights. Tried to unplug for 30 seconds and plug back in. Tried the reset button. Could not log into router. It was dead. I've trusted Netgear product's for many years and this is by far the worst product I have ever purchased from them. I must say this router was by far the best router I have owned until it died randomly. However, due to the horrible product life I would definitely recommend not purchasing this router."
1,"Terrible Technical Support, Poor Customer Service","I wish I had researched Netgear more thoroughly before I bought my wireless gear from them. I regret it. Despite good editorials, their products break down with astonishing regularity. If that isn't bad enough, their scripted, plastic technical support seems to be designed more to deliver infuriating platitudes and block the customer from getting any meaningful resolution to their problem (that might cost Netgear an extra nickel) than to be sincerely helpful.Consider this a ""danger sign."" You may choose to ignore it, but be ready for the consequences."
1,6 months later and it now Shuts off by itself,"All I can say is that i am very disapointed with this product. I have had the same problems as others have posted here. The need to reboot every now and then to get it to work fast, and now 6 months later it just shuts off. I can pull the power cord out of it for about 10 seconds, then a green light comes on. After about 2 minutes it starts to work again, but then shuts off randomly for no apparent reason. - Junk!"
1,what a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE little device,"This is an absolute horror and crap from NetGEAR. In fact, if they do not offer to fix the firmware issue asap, I am never ever going to buy NETGEAR every again in my life.How the hell a company could release such a crappy product is beyond me. And why the heck didnt the hardware review sites like CNET and PCMAG kill this POS.Please stay away... I learned the hard way.Connecting to this POS is impossible after a complete day of trying various configurations. I am going to go out and get a $20 router instead. This is just pathetic from NETGEAR.STAY AWAY!!!!!!"
1,Four (4) units dead so far,"I bought 8 of them for a large multi-site project and over the last 8 months, four units have died in the same way.The reseller won't take them back past 90 days and Netgear support is useless.I smell class-action."
1,Another DISSATISFIED Customer!,"Like many of the reviews you see here, I too became a victim of this router and have always been a faithful Netgear user. Brand new, NUMEROUS, NUMEROUS frustrating calls to God knows where in India... I'm done. I can buy a brand new router (not sure I'm going with Netgear after all these years) for what they're charging me to return the router, not to mention the HOURS of my time spent in trying to troubleshoot, upgrade firmware, etc., etc.BUYERS BEWARE!!! Netgear RangeMax Next WNR854T is a defective router right out of the box. From what I've read here, if yours works out of the box it won't be long before it's dead! Gave it one star because the system won't let me give it zero."
1,Another failed unit,"Purchased on 15 Jun 07, hard failed (nothing but the green power light will come on) on 9 Dec 07."
1,Died after 1 minute,"- Bought the product, plugged it in, worked fine at first- Set it up in the admin panel to use 300 Mbps rather than 145 Mbps- Router died, green power light, absolutely dead.Total lifetime: 1 minute 15 seconds."
1,Router died within 6 months,"TOL's review is exactly what happened to me. Unfortunately I was not able to read the review, no Internet connection. So we bought the same one again... Probably ending up with 2 bad routers. I chose for option 2 so that we have at least a backup when the new one dies. Shipping price went up to 16.90"
1,Do not buy this!,"The router worked fine for more than a year for me. Its 802.11n spec and sleek design compared to others was what made me buy this then. Unfortunately, I wasn't too careful to have read others' reviews, and my router (like many others') had died yesterday without any reason. I looked for a new router today and D-Link DIR-655 seemed to have great reviews from users and magazines."
3,Not ready for prime time.,A number of advertised features were not implemented and a number were listed as not working correctly. This included the security and ecryption. Netgear could not give a date when this would all be taken care of.I returned it. Looks like Netgear rushed this to market before it was ready.
1,Died after 3 years,"The wireless part stopped working after 3 years. Maybe for some people that's expected lifetime but I have wireless routers that are from 2003/2004. For the record I'm an experienced tech and tried different to reboot, re-flashed, reconfigured (tried changing channels, etc) still to no avail... This will be the last time I buy Netgear or Linksys (linksys WRT54g doesn't even have an ip address reservation table; other models probably do but what else are they missing? I even have this for my $20 Dynex (Bestbuy brand) router which is still working after 5 years))"
1,"Crashes constantly, I'm going back to linksys","At home, I recently upgraded to this router from a Linksys wireless-G because I wanted the wireless-N and gigabit built-in switch. The range is great, the switch is great, and the speed is great. The only problem is, is that it crashes at least once a day requiring a restart before you can regain internet access. For me that is a pain. I am the systems admin here at work (so I know what I'm doing) and here I purchased a Linksys Wireless-N and have had zero problems with it. Needless to say I'm going back to Linksys. Worst router I have ever owned. Also if you have an xbox 360, this router does not like to communicate with it. After a bunch of trial and error, the only way to get decent speed and ping is to DMZ the Xbox 360 on a wired connection. Not terrible but, I never had to do that with any other routers."
1,TOL is right -- this thing is cruddy,"The review by TOL is right on. This router worked great for about 6 months and then just died without any triggering event -- I simply woke up one morning and it was toast. TOL's statements about the customer service are accurate. I waited 15 minutes so that I could talk to a dude in India who was nice, but whose accent was so strong that I had to keep asking ""what?"" Not good. This router is expensive, too. Netgear should provide a longer warranty if they are going to produce sub-standard products. Better yet, perhaps Netgear should produce a higher quality product with better customer support. I have several Netgear products in my mega-wired home -- I think I'll stick to Linksys in the future, which has yet to fail me."
2,Another victim,"TOL from long island was pretty much correct on his review. I just wanted to update that. The option to have it within 2 business days costs $29.90 instead of the price of the router. This router worked great for me up until 2 days ago when i received the dreaded green light. I purchased it in April. If this replacement router does the same thing, I think I will head in another direction for my router needs. Once again, it worked great until that green light."
1,Poor Product than WGT624,"This product is not functioning well as my old router WGT624 (more than 2.5 yrs old, purchased on Sep - 2004) and as per buyers expectations & product description. Not knowledgeable NETGEAR customer service for Bell South internet configuration/setup. It took 16 business hours to setup internet & VOIP with NETGEAR WNR854T router. And still wireless speed is lower than my old router WGT624. My Laptop and Desktop dropping wireless connection so many times (close to 100 square feet area). Finally, I frustrated and return this router back to Amazon. I felt that it's a defective product. I spent more time than the router real value."
1,Miserable POS,"I have owned this router for exacly five months to the date and it is usless.I have had problems with this router from day one but learned to live with it dropping wireless connections randomly, wired ethernet connectons would stay connected. I would have to unplug and restart this router about once a month to restore my connections because it would ""lock up"" and not allow networking, untill today when all I have is a shiney piece of plastic with one green power light and nothing else. Tech support is usless unless I am willing to PAY for it.When it worked, it was wonderfull, great range but would drop you then re-connect. What a pain, guess I'm out the 100 bucks or so I shelled out for a premium router..."
2,Troublesome,"I don't think I've had to power-cycle a router more than I've had to with this one. Last nite, I had no internet access (again). I power-cycled again, and when I plugged it back in, the power light is immediately green, and nothing else comes on. I'm guessing this is what some refer to as 'the Green Light of Death'. Ticks me off."
4,"Solved my problem, Great Performance, but don't use the easy setup if possible","Due to a new addition to the family, my office was moved to the back room of the house. This caused a wifi dead-zone in my famiy room. My old Netgear Wireless G router just didn't perform at 100 feet so I tried Netgear's RangeMax NEXT WNR854M (not the WNR854T) and it solved the problem. My only complaint is setup, which didn't go smoothly for me. I can't blame Netgear completely, I should have known not to use their wizard since my network configuration is a bit custom. Netgear's wizard program actually crashed by laptop and screwed up my wireless settings. After troubleshooting for an hour, I finally got it going using the web interface."
3,Worked great for about a week,"I was very excited to try this RangeMax router. When the internet connection worked, the router provided great range and speed. However, the router lost the connection with the cable modem quite frequently. This required restarting the modem and the router and then refreshing the connection through the router's administrative program. I had purchased a service plan from Netgear and had this unit replaced. The new router had the same connection problems, so I have switched to a Linksys Wireless N Home Router. I would strongly recommend purchasing a more reliable wireless router."
1,16 days to failure - beat that!,"There should be a contest for the shortest-lived WNR854T router. My first one lasted 16 days. My suspicion is the power transformer because it makes a loud whistling sound that can be heard from a room away. I've never heard anything like that before.When it did work, I had some of the previously-described problems with quirky connections, etc. Netgear should be ashamed of this product."
1,DocG,"I have never written a review before, but felt this needed to be said. I purchased my router July of 2006 and it worked great and was easy to set up. As of the middle of Dec...the 19th to be specific..it died. Nothing happened to break it, it just died. Power light is on, but no one is home. I have tried to reboot the system, reinstall, everything, but the power light is all that works. I truly feel that I wasted $120. Do not buy this product unless you want to replace it every few months."
1,"Blazing speed, but rendered useless","I lost my primary Netgear wired router to a lightning storm, so I took the opportunity to upgrade both my wired and wireless networks with this product. The speed improvement in my network was fantastic, BUT I can't get out onto the internet.After hours of troubleshooting, it turns out that it does not pass DNS traffic out to the internet properly (I've tested other Netgear routers and wireless routers on my network and confirmed that this problem is unique to this product). Despite contacting support multiple times, my support case has gone unanswered for weeks.I'd recommend waiting for updated firmware versions (currently at 1.3.04) prior to buying this product."
2,Adding my voice to the litany,"This product is seriously flawed. As has been said, no, I'm not a newbie, no I'm not particularly bitter or angry and I have no vendetta. That said - I was quite happy to get this product, as my prior G network had always been plagued by instability and interference. The device set up easily and provided excellent coverage. My elation was short lived when I discovered that it would stop responding every fifteen or twenty minutes, dropping connection to my laptop, my wife's laptop, my daughter's mac mini, my Smartphone - you name it. You can access the admin web page over the wire, but not wirelessly (because nothing is actually connected). Netgear told me to update the firmware, but there is no firmware update (I'm on the latest version). In short, great concept, lousy execution. Don't buy this thing."
1,Watch out with the Warranty,"Do not waste your money on this router, it does not worth the $160+. the features are not worth it, you can get the same from a cisco / linksys halve the price (without the pre n)Watch out with the Warranty, mine got bad after 3 month and this is what the offer for replacement:3 ways of ""returning a defective unit""1. You pay shipping, send it to the them and they return a new unit (5-10 days)2. You pay $17 they send you a new one, you use the same box to return the unit. (5-10 days)3. You pay $30 they send it overnight, same as option 2This guys does not understand that you can get a new wireless router from other company for $40 ...."
1,Great until it breaks,"Do not buy this router. It looks good and worked very well for me and then suddenly died after 8 months. I got a replacement under warranty from Netgear, which also worked well and then suddenly died after 4 months, at which point my warranty had expired. I have always used Netgear's products and have never had one of their products die on me like this. I am going to try out D-Link and hope that theirs can at least last for a full year. Never again."
1,Worked great until it died,"I've had this router for ten months, and this morning it just suddenly stopped working. Tried resetting factory defaults, but it won't even stay powered on. Not having the luxury to wait for a replacement, I bought an Airport Extreme. If you're thinking about buying a netgear, save yourself some time and trouble and just set your money on fire instead."
2,"Great router, but has a to high failure rate","I and some of the people I consult with, bought about a dozen of the NetgearWNR854T routers. Bought them for the gigabit network support. They work great. But now that we have had them 13 months, we have had 3 hardware failures, just out of the 12 month warranty. That seems like a very highfailure rate to me.It is a great router to connect to the cable modem and hook up a couple ofdesktops to a file server over gigabit ethernet when you need speed to movelarge graphic, video, and data files around."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"Currently waiting for my 3rd router from Netgear, first router simply died, second router intmertinent signal drops wired and unwired along with constant lockups (which include not able to access the gateway under lockup). Lockups occur approximately every 2 hours of use. Couple this with range that stinks, tech support that loves to make you reset the router every 2 seconds and ask which firmware are you running?This product is completely unstable and plagued with problems. Want more proof. Netgears own forums are filled with the same thing every person is complaining about in this thread. Quite frankly this product is a POS."
1,Worked Well and Then it Failed,"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this product. It worked fairly well for maybe 6 weeks, although I did have to reset the product a few times by cycling the power. Then one day I came in and all the lights were blinking as usual other than the wireless light. I couldn't get any type of connection to the internet and even called in a computer repair guy to fix it. It appears that something burnt up internally in the router, even though I had it on a good UPS.Netgear usually has a great product, but this one failed completely. I've had other Neatgear routers that have lasted years, so I'm not sure what's wrong with this product, but I would definitely recommend not buying it. Try out one of their other products, but be sure to read the reviews just in case that's a faulty one, too. Don't make the mistake I did."
1,Don't Buy Netgear WNR854T,"My Netgear WNR854T worked extremely well for 10 months and then just died all of sudden. If I had read all those reviews, I would not have bought this router in the first place. Hope this review helps you make the right decision!!"
1,This product should be recalled,"Purchased 7/8/2007, died (single green light) 12/29/2007. After seeing so many other people having the same problem, I think Netgear should recall this product."
1,live and learn,"this router died with the 'green light' issue after several months. having read the reviews here i figured why bother with the same problem with a replacement and so I bought a new router. the coverage and signal strength on this one was great when it worked so since i already have several netgear wireless adapters i went ahead and purchased one of the new netgear routers, a WNR3500, thinking netgear must have figured out the issue by now. it worked great for 3 weeks and then failed with the same exact green light issue. i returned it and got a linksys router.i've used netgear products for the last several years but i won't any longer."
5,What a great group,"I had the opportunity to run sound for these guy's in Buena Vista, Va., and I was shocked. The drive these guy's had was just wonderful. The music they played left everybody talking. Great talent and just a good group of people."
1,Wished it would work,"This product did not work for me. I was hoping it would stop my nighttime leg cramps, but when I awoke in pain with cramps, the pills did not stop the cramping. I have since solved my leg cramp problem by drinking 6 - 8 glasses of water each day. The cramps were caused from dehydration."
3,Pulled for a reason,I have long standing leg cramp issues since a child and am now 47. These pills work with the quinine ingredient but there have been definite links between cardiac issues and quinine over the long term. Research on the internet---it's all there. I use them sparingly and only when desperate.
3,Hyland's Leg Cramp pills rule!,"I have been using Hyland's for several years. Other than an RX for quinine that used to be available, there is nothing that can beat this product. I like the homepathic remedies, and Hylands rules!"
1,Hyland's leg crame quinine pill,The pill only gave me partial relief to leg cramps. I have a kidney problem - perhaps it is not designed to help that ailment.
1,Not the same as the free sample.,"Hyland's has been offering a free sample of their leg cramp pills. The packaging looks the same as this, but it is not. I will say that the person for whom this product was purchased for was not pleased. She said that they do not work and that her money was wasted. I have no idea what the difference in the pills that we bought off Amazon and the free sample was... but we want to buy what was in the sample."
1,BAD NEWS,"I HAD TO RETURN THIS ITEM AND GET MY MONEY BACK. UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS NOT ABLE TO RECOUP SHIPPING CHARGES. I RETURNED THE ITEM TO MY LOCAL VITAMIN SHOPPE.THE FDA HAD PULLED ALL ITEMS OFF THE SHELF THAT CONTAINED ""QUININE"" BEFORE I MADE MY PURCHASE. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE THE ITEM ONLINE.BUYER BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Smouldering Fire is rather surprising,"From the book jacket: In Smouldering Fire, we find a rare combination of love, mystery and humor. It has always been one of the author's favorites.It involves a Scottish landowner that leases his land to a hunting syndicate and remains there as a worker on the loch when the hunting party takes over his house and coverts. He meets a guest and her young son, who know him only as the boatmender. MacAslan has seen the woman before in Edinburgh and lost his heart to her on the spot. Now she knows him only as a worker on the estate.He discovers that she is escaping from her brutal husband and is hiding until her divorce can be finalized. Unfortunately her husband finds her and demands that she come back to him. Iain tries to find a way to help Linda resolve her situation. Then to the puzzlement of them both, her husband disappears.Iain MacAslan and his family are also found in The Marriage of Katherine and The House of the Deer."
5,Moderate with intent to annoy,"Brad Stein is a hilarious, conservative, Christian comic. That said, if you fit that description, I would definitely recommend it. He makes excellent points through uproarious comedy; a domain normally reserved for those of a more liberal persuasion. Kudos to Stein; it's about time that conservatives had a few voices like that! If you're like me, and like to play the devil's advocate in political discussions, I would also definitely recommend it. Liberals and the intolerant beware; Brad Stine is in your face. And he's not apologizing."
5,Put a helmet on,"If six stars were available, I'd give it a six.From watching this I have three suggestions:Buy itBuy itBuy itThis is one of the funniest videos you'll watch in your lifetime. There is an old theory in comedy that the closer the joke is to the truth, the funnier it is. Brad's 'realizations' are just that. He has taken some of the most obvious realizations that those of us without his wit haven't made and brought them to the stage. Moreover, it's a video you can watch with the family (you can't say that about too many videos). The only better decision you could make in your life than buying this video is going to see him in concert.Sincerely,Dr. Scott C"
3,Too complicated,"Don't get me wrong. I love the burglar series. But this one was a bit too complicated to enjoy. When I read a Rhodenbarr book, I don't want to have to think too hard, but this one has too many twists and too many paintings to keep track of. The story starts out nice enough, with a kidnapped cat and a ransom call (in a Nazi voice) requesting a Mondrian painting. Unfortunately, the catnapping story loses steam and after awhile, I think Lawrence Block almost forgot it, then suddenly tried to wrap a bow around it. Bernie reveals the twisted details in the end, but he doesn't sufficiently explain how he solves the mystery. He rounds up the suspects into one room for the showdown, and the suspect list includes characters heretofore unseen. I wish all the suspects could have been introduced to the reader before hand, so we had a fighting chance to figure out the mystery ourselves."
5,Acquired taste,"Bernie Rhodenbarr mysteries are an acquired taste. If you like pulp fiction with plain old escapism, these are the books for you."
3,enjoyable,I like his books. They are told with a sense of humor. They are easy to read and hold my interest. This book had a lot of information abour painters.
3,Please specify that this is for ONE cable not the set...,Misleading that they don't say it is just one cable. Most bikes have TWO sets of brakes. Seems like they are decent quality though.
3,No major flaws so far,"There are a few problems with this workbook...which isn't to say that it doesn't have value as a text. This book has helped me learn, without a doubt. However, it isn't as user friendly as I'd like. For example, there are a number of exercises that have a picture on one side of a page, and then questions about the picture on the back. There are also exercises that end on one page, and then a new activity continues on the back. This is only a problem if your teacher/professor wants you to tear out the pages, because then you're missing the first part of your assignment.None of these problems are critical, but it does cause a few inconveniences now and then.Of course, I've only completed the exercises through Chapter 5, so take my comments with a grain of salt."
3,Not the best,Nakama text is very confusing. Genki or Japanese for busy people are much better if you are studying on your own. I had to buy it for college class. I wish they were using the Genki text or Yookoso text they are so much better.
2,Do Not Like,The smell is too strong and unpleasent. I used it in the Roomba (maybe it is only for the vacuum with bag?). Not recommend. Using baking soda is much better then this.
5,Oreck Fresh Air Vacuum Scent Tabs,Vendor very quick to ship. Excellent pricing and excellent product. Makes it easy to find needed parts and accessories for an old(er) model upright vacuum. Thank you!
4,Haven't used them yet but hoping they'll be worth it...,We haven't ever used these before but again for the price we thought we'd try them out and see. I still have yet to try them for sure but the odor is very nice from what I can tell so far. You can smell it before you even open the packages... should be good...
1,OUCH!,"Dog's fine.... but my right hand ain't!Extremely bad handle design: a common flaw on many cheaptools, the handle snapped shut on the skin of my palm, leavingme with an inch-long blood blister. (and, the blades are poorlymated and too loose to provide a clean nail-cut after a few uses)Amazon has other, better choices."
2,works great--til it breaks!,"nice and sharp, easy to use, but made of pretty crappy materials. the bit that holds the springs in broke off within a few uses. . . rendering it useless. . ."
3,big clipping sound,"We have a cat trimmer by the same company that works great so I got one for the dog. Well, my dog (60 lbs) did not like the sound when his nails were clipped. He got up and walked away after just two clips. We had something similar in design by a different company that did not make a sound at all. I am not sure if this clipper supposes to make a loud noise like this or if we have a defective product. The clipper itself is unremarkable that it clips like it supposes to, not super sharp but adequate. We haven't tried the other parts. Wish we got something else."
1,These hurt!,"I bought these trimmers to use on my 2 large dogs. They do a fine job on the dogs' nails, but they catch the skin of my hand and give it a hard pinch every time I squeeze the handles. Definitely not worth the pain."
1,Be Careful!,I purchased these and they seemed to be poorly made. The blades didn't match up exactly and they pinched my hand very badly! I had a mark for at least two weeks. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Poorly Made,"When I took these out of the package I gave them a squeeze to see how they felt. When I did this the two cutting edges caught each other and immediately ruined the 'blades' - ruined before they even touched my dog's nails. I tried putting a new edge on them with a 5/32"" round file but the shape of the blades makes it pretty much impossible to sharpen them. I tried using them but they were far too dull. All in all, a complete waste of time and money."
4,Dog nail trimmers,"I was very pleased with this product. I used it as soon as I received it and it is a quality product. The description of the item was accurate and I was not disappointed when I received it. Unfortunately, it cost me about as much to ship it as buy it, but it was something I had been looking for and could not find elsewhere."
3,Not bad but not the best.,"I bought these to use on my St Bernard after trying a number of other products. The fact that the file and styptic dispenser are built into the handle is a nice bonus so no need to try and keep up with several products. As for the main purpose of this, clipping nails, it does ok. I was trying to find something that did not take a huge amount of force to use. I still had to apply a lot of force to use this one, so if you are weak handed, this is not for you. As for the cut of the nail, it was able to do so without the splits and splintering that some clippers cause. For the cost, its worth the money. I think it would be better suited for medium size dogs rather than large breeds."
2,dog nail clipper,"Honestly, I didn't see whole lot of difference between this clipper anda less expensive one you would buy at Petco or elsewhere. It worked fine but I am not a groomer so it's not a chore I feel completely comfortable with no matter what the quality of product I use."
3,Looks better than it works,I have a 2008 Suzuki GS500. I get blown around a bit on the highway. I saw this and thought I would try it. It arrived very quickly and only took 20 minutes to put on following the photocopied instruction sheet. It is not tall enough to offer great wind sheilding (I'm five foot ten) at speeds above 80km/h. It's okay if you crouch down under it. But people have complimented on how good it looks.
4,Hot like fire,"One of the best short story collections I have ever read! The stories are well written, compelling and very sensuous. Highly recommended for those with a large sexual appetite. Guaranteed to leave you feeling satisfied."
2,CANT TRUST THESE SISTAHS,"THE BOOK WAS GREAT AND ALL, BUT WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS THAT SOME OF THESE BLACK WOMEN IN THESE STORIES HAVE A BOYFRIEND OR A HUSBAND, AND THEYRE OUT THERE CHEATIN OR HAVIN AN AFFAIR. WHAT KINDA SH!# IS THAT?!!!! THATS WHY NOBODY CAN TRUST THESE WOMEN. I LOVE THEM, BUT I KNOW THAT IM NOT GONNA BE HAVIN NO LASTIN RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. CAUSE THATS NOT WHAT THEY WANT. THEY WANT SEX, THEN THATS WHAT IMMA GIVE THEM. AND THEY RUN AROUND CRYIN BOUT THEY CANT FIND A GOOD MAN. THANKS TO BROWN SUGAR 2, I KNOW WHAT THESE SISTAHS WANT. AND IMMA GIVE IT TO THEM. THEY DONT WANNA BE FAITHFUL, THEN THEY COULD BE THE OLD ONE IN THE CLUB, CAUSE ""IM INTO HAVIN SEX, I AINT INTO MAKIN LOVE....."" LET THE GAMES BEGIN....."
3,"Merry Christmas, David Geffen!","This is another Christmas compilation album. It is an odd mixture of tunes. There are a couple of great songs; those being ""Christmastime"" by Aimee Mann & Michael Penn and ""Thanks For Christmas"" by XTC. Also notable is ""The Little Drum Machine Boy"" by Beck, which starts off well but runs too long at seven minutes length. The rest of the songs are not really anything special. Particularly bad is Wendy & Lisa's awful song from that awful movieToys. But the good songs I mentioned save it from being a complete disaster."
1,Get only if you are a Beck fanatic,"The Xmas tunes on this compilation are weak. The Beck tune is cool, but the other tunes are passable."
1,New Recordings - Be Warned,The songs on this disc are Original Artists with New Recordings of the their hits. YUK!
4,Very good but could be better,"The WS-200S is the best digital recorder that I was able to find for the purpose of college classroom recording. I tried a Sony digital recorder (and I can not recall the model) but was disappointed by the frequency response and by the excessively tight compression. The WS-200S has excellent frequency response and clear audio compression.If Olympus were to ask me what could be done to improve the product, I would tell them:1. file naming could be more descriptive (i.e.OWS200S_YYYY-MM-DD_ hhmmss.wma) (see Sony's product).2. flash ram capacity could be larger (512 MB) orexternal USB flash ram storage device connectivitywould be nice3. user definable Windows Media Audio format settings(32-128kb cbr)could be nice4. MP3 storage format would be nice too5. an optional crush proof, metal foil shielded carryingcase would be a good thingAside from my wish list details, this recorder is the best unit I could find. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
3,Static,"Don't move this item while recording! You'll get nothing but static... don't have it in a pocket either. However, when sitting still, it is fine."
3,Convenient when it works,"This recorder does a good job of picking up local voices. Don't put it in your pants pocket and walk around because about all you'll hear are swishing sounds. It seems to work well in transferring the files to a computer as it plugs into a USB port and looks like another portable drive.My biggest problem has been the device turns off unexpectedly. After doing this about a dozen times, it finally got to where it wouldn't turn on at all so I ended up sending it back to the manufacturer for warrant repair. Fortunately, they were able to repair or replace it and it's currently working."
3,So So Recorder,Nice package cool download to you pc. Internal recording Mic is barely passable for it to be called a mic. You have to use an external mic to get good quality recording.
2,Olympus WS-200S 128 MB Digital Voice Recorder,"the recorder record and play ok but two things I am disappointed:1. the battery is not included even thought the package claims it does.2. the battery indidcator does not work well. It would show full charge and then unexpectedly, recoding was interrupted with low charge displayed. However, after one powers cycly the unit, the battery shows full charge again."
4,Fantasy Film for Kids,This film has a touch o-the-green fantasy. It also shows that miracles do happen and it is not due the the fantasy of lephrachan's. Good for children to teach good values.
4,Good Fun For the Kids,"Now, first off Activision (it's their name on the box) did a poor job of saying that the PC version is different from the one on X-box...It IS NOT the same, but that's not a bad thing.Actually my son and daughter had a great time with this game. My son said ""Dad this is diff'rent from the one on X-box, it's funnier.""..This was obvious from his laughter throughout the game. I watched and laughed along with them..It also had good graphics ( better than most kid games). They seemed to only have trouble with a few spots, but got through the puzzles after a few tries, with little help from dad.A good purchase,"
1,This game is not good. Enough said.,Not the Playstation version. It took 2 hours to beat. The voice acting is lame. Get another game.That's all I really have to say about that.
5,My son loves this book,"My son loves this book but it is out of print. His school library has a copy and he checks it out often. Found a used book seller who had an almost perfect copy - first edition too. We bought some other books for him by the same author, but this is his favorite."
5,Enjoyable,"This is an heroic little story told from the point of view of several different characters. One of my children is practicing something similar in language arts, so the timing on this book is great. And it's so entertaining -- borderline ridiculous -- but the story just keeps getting funnier and funnier. Excellent illustrations by Paul Howard.This one is a keeper."
5,perfect Christmas gift,My mother was looking for the creamer & sugar set to go with her dishes. I was able to find it on Amazon at a very reasonable price. I received the item in less then one week after my order and in perfect condition! Merry Christmas Mom!
1,Not what I expected,"I saw the Kidz Delight Light and Sound Phonics in a catalog and ordered it from Amazon for my 3-year-old grandson. I thought it would be a great tool to help him learn the alphabet, etc. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. When the dial is moved to the left, the toy speaks English and when it's moved to the right, it speaks Spanish - extremely confusing for a small child developing language skills. I checked with the catalog's customer service and their item is only in English so even though it looked the same, it certainly wasn't. I didn't see Spanish mentioned in the Amazon listing or in the customer reviews."
1,Stopped working a few wks after purchase,"This was a refurbished DVD player. I would not purchase it again, as it stopped working after just a few weeks. Definitely a waste of money."
3,Good But Not The Orginal Hits,"Drew's Famous 30 Greatest Summer Hits is a great compilation of summer music. However, don't expect to hear the orginal hits by the original artists. The songs have all been re-recorded (and quite well) by a group called The Hit Crew. While I added this to my collection of summer songs, it is definitely secondary to""25 All-Time Greatest Summer Songs"" on the Varese Sarabande label and available from Amazon.com which features the orginal hits AND the orginal recording artists."
4,Scissor set,"These scissors are NOT the best quality, but still a GOOD value for everyday use. If you want professional quality, spend more, get more!"
5,Great Scissor Assortment,"These scissors are comfortable to use, solid, attractive. The sizes bundled in this set were just what I was looking for. Excellent product - great value."
4,A necessity and a good value....,Certainly not bad as far as scissors go. What I really like are the different types as I certainly have a use for all of them. Would buy this product again....
4,Good basic set,"A nice basic scissor set for the home. Not the same quality as the top brands, but you aren't paying top brand price either. The scissors were all sharp and have done the job around the home just fine so far!"
3,Not the same as 10 years ago: actually not the same period,"I bought this same set about 10 years ago. The quality of those was better than these are now. The new ones are nice, just not as good of quality as they were 10 years ago. These are ""International"" and are NOT made in Germany like the set I got 10 years ago.These are made in Korea and China. Maybe they still sell the German set I bought previously and I just missed it somehow.I would not recommend this set. It appears cheaply-made and not of high quality like the German-made set I already have. These were going to be a gift, but I'm not sure they are good enough to give as a gift."
1,Shame on Henckels,"Beware, these scissors are low quality, not what you would expect from Henckels. They are manufactured in Korea and China with cheap, uncomfortable plastic handles. I own a genuine pair of Henckels kitchen shears which I purchased at Macy's about 20 years ago. They are still in great condition and work perfectly. This is the type of quality that I was hoping for when I purchased this 5-piece set. Unfortunately, what I got was a set of cheap imitations. I returned my order. Don't make the same mistake that I made."
1,Junk,"I have a good set of Henckels knives, these have absolutely nothing to do with them. They are cheap, the kitchen shears don't come apart (which of course they should for complete cleaning) the ""anvil"" flower trimmers, what a joke. The ""anvil"" is cheap plastic instead of brass, the catch sticky, the handles cheap plastic. I have bought equal scissors in the drug store for $3.99 each.Why they have the Henckels brand on these is beyond me. They'll most likely go back. I don't have junk in my kitchen. I'll not start with these."
2,MY REVIEW,"The garden shears are broke, the clasp that is suppose to keep them closed does not work, was disappointed that this brand would have a defective item."
1,SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY,"I have never felt strongly enough about a book to write a review before now-but wanted to stop others from wasting $19.99. As a Bewitched fan I really looked forward to reading this book. Boy was I disappointed. It is hard to read-looks like they just slapped it together with no thought to continuity. The ""trivia"" is nothing new-it is the same tired information contained in every Bewitched article or website. Many of the facts are inaccurate or don't even pertain to Bewitched. Not even Dr. Bombay could help this dog."
5,Bedazzled by Bewitched Book!,I liked reading The Magic of Bewitched because it has a lot of fun trivia quizzes and I learned stuff about the show I didn't know!
1,horrible,"Huge disappointment. This book is filled with random collections of series facts, and has almost nothing of interest for fans of the show.Practically nothing on bloopers, no interviews, no gossip, just one list after another. 80 pages worth of episode synopses, a list of drinks that they consumed??? Don't bother."
5,excellent,A COLLECTOR OF BEWITCHED MEMORABILIA AND WILL PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM ANYONE WHO HAS THESE PRODUCTS
5,Bewitched Trivia,"This is a great book for the fans of the ""Bewitched"" TV show. My daughter loved it. Thank you!!!"
2,"wrong cognitive concept, method does not work well","Vocabulearn unfortunately was a flop. It just has loose words without any order, under the presumption that you will hear them that way. Sure, but they need to be retrieved well-classified in cognitive networks.This was a cheap old used set, otherwise I would be unhappy for the money spent. I also bought Russian, and it's the same. Also the transcript is very skimpy."
2,$160 for a small book,When I first read the title of the book I thought wow! The content of the book is not that relevant.
2,Left me wanting more,"I first heard about Violette Szabo when I read the book ""A Life in Secrets""A Life in Secrets: Vera Atkins and the Missing Agents of WWII. When I came across ""Violette Szabo: The Life that I had"" by Susan Ottaway I was intrested. After reading the book, I was left longing to know more about her. The book is thin on details and while the pictures were nice I thought there could have been more to the book.Overall, Violette Szabo:A Life in Secrets is decent it may leave wanting to know more about this brave woman and those she served with in the SOE."
2,Unacceptable battery performance,"Have owned this drill for a couple of years and while it performed well in use, the batteries are the achilles heel of this drill. Almost immediately, one of the batteries started to underperform and within a year, I was essentially down to one battery. Despite careful charging, within a couple of years both batteries are shot from hobby / home use. Replacement batteries are more than the cost of the whole kit. Would recommend some of the new generation of lithium batteries over this clunker."
4,Love It,"I this album. I bought it at the same time as froSTed (Jane Wiedlin from the Go-Go's band). What the other reviewers have missed here is the presence of Charlotte Caffey (The Go-Go's) and her husband Jeff McDonald (Redd Kross). It certainly fits in with the style of music that Caffey and McDonald worked with during this period (froSTed, Jewel, Hole, Belinda Carlisle etc). I love the songs ""Minneapolis"", ""Never Say Never"" etc are great. It follows in line with the other great girl groups."
3,kinda cold out here without the sun...,"I bought this one after That Dog, and i immmediatly noticed many differences. This album is more commercial sounding..and it lacks the high and low points that their self titled album had. many of the songs sounded the same and their mood was very monotonous.. ""i'm gonna see you"" provides a kinda peppy start to the album ... but then it goes onto ""never say never"" which to me sounded like a song screaming for radio play, which was an element i did not see in the first album and so i did not think twice about purchasing this one. overall, it has some decent songs (""gagged and tied"", which actually i find halarious), but i would definatly not buy it before the self titled album."
2,can't reccomend,"There are maybe 3 or 4 interesting songs on here, but like was said before, the production kills everything. What's with the surf guitar on 'Retreat From the Sun'? I haven't heard any of the other That Dog albums, but I'm really not interested after hearing this."
3,drags,I am a kennedy affectionado and have most of the tapes produced etc. Although the acting was average this film did not really delve into RFK s childhood and family interactions with other siblings. Since I enjoy most Kennedy stories I wasn't disappointed just felt it could have been done better. Didn't really get his relationship with Monroe it was unclear. Anyway for entertainment it is worth a watch and would recommend to others as a DVD to watch.
2,Damaged DVD,"I'm sure the movie is great; however, I couldn't watch it because they shipped me a cracked, worthless DVD. I have tried to contact the seller about this problem and I have heard nothing back."
2,Too Dreamy and Hokey,"The plot centers around Senator Robert Kennedy seeing apparitions of his brother John Kennedy. The language, though I thought would be closed caption so my TV guardian would catch it, is very course at times. The action plot is very slow. I haven't seen this film but once since I purchased it a few years ago. I may re-sale it."
2,Delusional and Inaccurate,"I was hoping for much better from this production. But based on the fact that nobody else in the world has seen it, I should have known better. I thought the movie was so bad, I could not finish.The writers have chosen to rewrite history in many ways. First, RFK apparently had schizophrenia because his reality was very distorted. JFK kept appearing to RFK throughout the movie. The most interesting thing is that RFK only speaks in a Massachusetts accent to his brother (or brother's illusion). As if distorting reality is not enough of a crime, the movie accuses Lyndon Johnson and the CIA of killing John Kennedy.Read a book on this fallen Catholic leader. Do not rely on this travesty as a source."
2,RFK,"Didn't care for the person playing RFK. It was like watching 'another' person step into his shoes, trying really hard to be convincing - but - didn't work."
2,Too hard to pull,I received this as a gift. I does not compare to the Lever Pull in any way shape or form. It takes tremendous amounts of strength to pull the lever back getting the cork off.I through it out last night after fighting with this for 12 months.
4,"MISFITS HAVE CHANGED THEIR LINEUP,BUT THE ATTITUDE HAS NOT!","LETS START FROM THE BEGINING SHALL WE! GLENN IS NOT THE VOICE LETS ALL GET OVER THAT ,PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! GRAVES VOICE IS ONE OF DEDICATION AND ONE WHO GETS TRE POINT ACROSS. HORROR AND THINGS OF THE UNLIGHT ARE ALL DISCUSSED HERE, AMPUTATION,RAISING THE DEAD,WOLVES,DEATH,THE DARKNESS OF SPACE. IF THEE WANT ANY MORE LOOK TO BLACK METAL!!!!!!!!! NOT PUNK MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The misfits are still sweet,"This cd is great. It has a good vibe to it. But one thing i cant stand is people griping about the misfits. Yes I know Graves is no Danzig but he still is really good. Its good that they have a new sound too. I dont know why people complain about how they suck now when if they came back and sounded exactly the same as they used to people would still complain that its to much the same and that they should do something different. I also hate when people say "" oh this isnt even the misfits "" because Jerry only and Doyle were in the original misfits ( Doyle came in a few years into it) and the band has always had different drummers so the only thing that is different is the singer and the sound. Anyways... The cd is great and sticks to the 50s music vibe they've always had. Some good songs are ""dig up her bones"", "" Shining"", ""mars attacks"" and "" the haunting "". If you like this cd pick up Famous monsters too."
3,AMERICAN PSYCHO,"Old faces and new faces.. Who can really judge the misfits.. THis cd is aggresive but its no Glenn Danzig unfortunatley. This Cd is very good, i recomend it. The songs on it are well done and this Cd was a big step for the misfits"
4,Misfits' Amercian Psycho,"Though an instant hardcore classic, AMERICAN PSYCHO lacks the subtext and subtlety of the Dnazig-era Misfits. That said, the Misfits return, blazing, fueled with frustration of fifteen years of involuntary exile. In the vein of Metallica's version of ""Last Caress/Green Hell,"" most of the album pummels through at high velocity, relentless."
3,RUN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THIS CD!,"Alright here's the deal, I bought this cd with an open mind. I understand black sabbath switched lead singers and so did ac/dc and alot of other bands and they still put out great music with both frontmen. Im not saying its not possible, it just didnt happen with the misfits. i bet with sabbath and ac/dc other bands members helped with writing the music, but with the fits, glenn wrote ALL OF IT! the lyrics and the music...he even taught some of the members how to play their instruments. so guess what happens when glenn leaves? uh-oh...now the band has to write music for itself and try and stand on its own two feet. this stuff isnt terrible, there are a couple decent tracks on here, but its a totally different band with a totally different sound. i hope glenn will forgive me for buying this...it sux."
1,"Michael Ruffin was the temptations, Glenn Danzig was the Misfits",It's sad that jerry only continues to destroy the misfits legacy. Making money off of kids must be real easy. It's sad that this album is rated so highly on this website. Are these crack induced ratings?
1,It sucked.,"Im sorry this is like the worst cd i've bought. There old stuff was alot better indeed! This cd was so corny too. There are 2 good songs(opinion) American Psycho, Resurrection. Operation Ivy and NOFX are so much better!"
2,THEY'RE BACK!! --UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL THE WAY.,"BEING A DIE HARD FAN OF THE OLD STYLE PUNK/HARDCORE SCENE. WHEN I HEARD THAT THE MISFITS, THE FIENDS WE ALL LOVE WERE RELEASING A NEW ALBUM I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS.AFTER A LONG TIME AWAY FROM THE STUDIO I FIGURED THAT THE SOUND WAS GOING TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT,BUT WITH THE LOSS AND THE LYRICS OF GLEN DANZIG TO HIS SOLO CAREER, THE CHEMISTRY IS GONE.THE BAND NOW SEEMS TO BE TRYING TOO HARD TO BREAK BACK INTO THE SCENE.BUT JUST LIKE OTHER BANDS TRYING TO MAKE A COMEBACK- AKA""THE DESCENDANTS"", THE FEELING HAS BEEN LOST.THERE ARE A FEW GOOD SONGS ON THIS ONE. CRIMSON GHOST CAPTURES THE SOUNDS OF OLD & JOHN DOYLE NO DOUBT IS BACK IN HIS GROOVE, BUT STILL SOMETHING'S JUST NOT THERE.ANYONE WHO IS THINKING ABOUT PICKING THIS ALBUM UP SHOULD FIRST CHECK OUT ""THE MISFITS"" AND ""COLLECTION II"" TO FIND OUT WHAT THE BAND WAS REALLY ABOUT THROUGH THIER PRIME IN THE 80's."
2,Give me a F@#king Break........,"I had to learn a couple of these songs to play in a Misfits cover band for a Halloween Park.This IS a crappy Misfits cover band. First off, I am not a Danzig loving freak, he is in no way the be all/end all of punk talent. Although I dig the original Misfits, I also find their lyrics a bit immature and am amused by their self perpetuated ""dark evilness""....yes, its a made up descriptor.But this album sucks. It sounds like a bunch of high school kids trying to be gloomy....its like emo-horror-goth-metal-fairy punk.Talent? It took me roughly one run through per song to get them down.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this crap....or use it as a coaster as I do now."
3,This CD is a disgrase to the legacy of the Misfits,"This Cd makes me sick. I have been listening to the Misfits for a long long time now and this is not them. Although they may have an original member and a half, they are something different. With a kid old enought to be thier son singing like Bad religion it makes me puke. The box set is in a coffin for a reason, let the misfits rest in peace.The only reason I gave it three stars is because the music still rocks. Go to hell Michael Graves!"
5,Danzig is not in the Misfits anymore....deal with it.,"I can't believe alot of the B.S. I'm reading here about how that ego maniac Glen ""was the misfits"". Glen had a great voice, but lousy personality.The 'Fits with Graves on vocals is the tightest sounding they ever were, and it's not just because of the production. Glen was just a front man, they come and go. If you're that bitter about it, he did release a number of cds on his own that you can go sing the praises of. Instead of bashing a really great cd because the band you loved as a kid 2o years ago moved on with their lives, and released a really great CD without their old singer."
4,Great CD it has a lot of catchy tunes,GREAT CD IT IS VERY GOOD. IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE ALL OTHER MISFITS CDS AND A LITTLE REPETITIVE BUT ALL AROUND A GREAT CD. IF YOU WANT A GOOD CD BUY THIS. bEST TWO SONGS ARE AMERICAN PHYSCHO AND HATE THE LIVING LOVE THE DEAD
2,Not The Misfits best,"I hate to sound repetitive, but the new Misfits just arent even close to what the old Misfits used to be. The new Misfts arent auful but they arent in my interest without Danzig, he is the best punk singer to ever live. He definatly reminds me of Morrison. Anyways if you want to here the origonal Misfits at there best definalty get ""Static Age"" or ""Walk Among Us""."
1,dont wast your money,its juat a ripoff you call your selves misfits fan misfits died when glen danzing left ive listened to them science iwas 1 year old dont buy this go static age
5,BOW TO THE NEW MISFITS!,"This is it, no more Danzig! Jerry and Doyle have shed the skin of the old Misfits, picked up a new drummer, Dr. Chud and a new kickass vocalist, Michale Graves. The music is a different kinda punk, the lyrics have a little more length to them, but you still get that eerie feeling you're not alone and that dead have risen when you listen to it! This is a big change for the Fits, but a good one also. This album shows great possiblities for the fiends of new with songs like ""Dig Up Her Bones"", a chilling love song based on The Bride Of Frankenstien, and ""Mars Attacks"", a very explanatory song about those crazy martians! Pick this up if you like the faster punk that has surfaced in recent years and pick it up if you're a fiend like myself. Dont buy this expecting Danzigs Misfits cause you wont get em! FIENDS FOREVER!"
3,A Grave Display,American Psycho on a whole is a good first outing for a new Misfits line up but leaves alot to be desired. The songs are hardly as polished as the later Famous Monsters but still give the listener a few good songs to sing along to. Michale Graves brings a fresh new approach to the vocal front while Dr. Chud and Doyle provide thunderous riffs to bang your head too. This isn't the classic Misfits by any means and most fans will agree but this is a record to check out but not the record to start with if your just getting into the band.
1,awful,terrible unmelodic no point never ending yup that would describe graves voice buy older DANZIG era stuffBRING ON THE HATE MAIL!!!
1,...,NO MISFITS r not the misfits W/o there singer ... graves sounds like he inhaled too much helium or hes just plain girly o welll bye old misfits... walk amongus leagacy of brutality and older stuff... o no now im gonna get hate mail...
4,Best misfits album to date.,"Despite the credit one must pay to Glenn Danzig, by far does Michael Graves exceed him.This album could be rated a near classic. Catchy melodies and speedy riffs, along with Graves' wicked/longing vocals makes this a must-have for any rock fan."
4,Strong album,"I'd like to start of by saying I'm a huge fan of the Glenn Danzig era Misfits but I have to except the fact that he's never gonna sing with the Misfits again, and what this album shows is that the rest of the band doesn't necessarily need him to sound good. Michale Graves does a good job on vocals and he definetley makes the horror feel of this band come alive. It's also nice to see Jerry Only pounding the hell out of his bass after all these years."
1,They should have stayed dead,"Being a long time Misfits fan, it pains me to do this, but I must fail this album on principle. As much as I love the Misfits, they should have stayed dead. Without Glenn, they just sound like a pale imitation of their old psychotic selves. Instead of Danzig's simple but powerful songs and hellbent yet vaguely poetic lyrics, we have a desperate attempt to relive glory days long since past. Stick with the old stuff."
3,Better Than it Should Be,"I never planned on getting this album. I thought it would be another band that lost pretty much all the members and would try to still be grabbing at that magic. I ended up hearing a live version of ""Speak of the Devil"" on a comp. I was really suprised. It got me to buy the album. I must say that the live version was better than the recorded song but it was still decent. The album kind of reminded me of the old days with a little new. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great. You will end up listening to it a couple of times and putting it away. A few months later you will pick it back up and think ""It really isn't that bad"". This will happen while you own it, which makes it a good thing. At least you don't feel like you wasted the cash."
4,Back from the Grave with a Vengeance,"This album is fantastic on it's own right whether or not you feel that the music on it is worthy of going under the moniker of the Misfits. I was hesitant like everyone else when I heard the Misfits were reforming without Danzig (who by the way had his chance to get back in and his answer was to throw Jerry Only out of his hotel by security, it's Ego that will keep the real Misfits in the grave forever) but by the time the title track had finished playing I was hooked and by the time the 17th track rolled around with ""Don't open till Doomsday"" I just couldn't not hit the repeat button and listen to the whole thing about 6 times in a row. Stunning return to form for the Misfits and way superior to Danzig 5 if we're going to get into the Danzig vs Graves debate (which I won't)..It kicks and Kills this record, purchase it now."
4,Not the best work of the Graves era...,"Both Graves and Danzig are wonderful in their own ways. There's no way to say one is better than the other because they're so different.Though I really love American Psycho, Famous Monsters is a little better. Graves just seems more comfortable on Famous Monsters. This is still a great album, though."
3,It's good but...,"Well, it's been years now since the Misfits released an album and here it is. It's good but it's not the original stuff that got them banned from the popular LA and New York clubs. Graves is good, he's young but he is no Danzig! LONG LIVE GLENN DANZIG!"
1,worst thing since the birth of ronald reagen,"I dont want to preach, i dont want ot be the typical fiend. But i will. this is horrible. Its just like some horrible mutant transformation of something thats good to something with five arms."
1,SUCKS EVEN WHEN USED AS A FRISBEE!,"I TOSSED THIS PEICE OF GARBAGE IN THE TRASH,AND RUMPKEE REFUSED TO TAKE IT."
1,NO GOOD,"Jerry Only is a disgrace and the whole band needs to be sued for misrepresentation. This is not the Misfits of old. It's nothing near them. I've never met a REAL Misfits fan who was into these clowns. Piece of factual information: Glenn Danzig wrote all music and lyrics for The Misfits, why would anyone think that he could leave some of that behind? This album and the other one they did sicken me. The Newfits are with out a doubt the biggest embarassment and inside joke in the music industry. Please don't buy into it. Get the Danzig Misfits. There's so much great music in the box set to tide anyone over. Anyone who praises this album no doubt came across this before they ever heard of Danzig. Please, don't support these idiots. Go get Old Misfits, Sam Hain, and of course, DANZIG."
3,MICHALE GRAVES IS GREAT,"okay this cd is not really that great it has some great songs such as DIG UP HER BONES, HAUNTING, DONT OPEN TILL DOOMSDAY and who can forget AMERICAN PHYSCO itself is a great songs both all the other songs a pretty boring...dont get me wrong Michale Graves is a great singer but this cd is boring if you want a great michale graves cd be sure to get FAMOUS MONSTERS everysong on this cd is great and soon to become MISFITS CLASSICS"
2,my 2 cents,"i grew up with real misfits. so now you know where this is going. they didnt sell out? yes, they did. its just as good? no its not. there is some catchy stuff here, but this is not the misfits of old. they will never be what the misfits of old were. never. young people, you missed out- go buy some vinyl (gasp) and listen to the old misfits stuff if you wanna know why this band even had a chance. they are two bands you know- danzig, whoever.. it could have been something else, but is not. they will never be what the misfits were. never."
4,Better than it is given credit for,"""American Psycho"" introduced the ""new"" version of the Misfits which included original bassist Jerry Only, longtime guitarist Doyle, and new members drummer Dr. Chud and singer Michale Graves. Graves' voice bears a stunning resemblance to that of Glenn Danzig's, but the band as a whole suffers without Danzig's writing and musical talents. However, ""American Psycho"" is much better than it is given credit for by longtime fans. The album is chock full of catchy hooks and B-grade horror movie lyrics, and the rhythm section of the band has grown and Graves' voice sounds fantastic. Standout tracks include the title track, ""From Hell They Came"", ""Mars Attacks"", ""Hate the Living, Love the Dead"", and the excellent ""Dig Up Her Bones"". All in all, longtime fans may not dig ""American Psycho"" or any of the newer material bearing the Misfits name, but all together this is a solid album."
1,thats sad,"im sure many will agree that this album is a huge dissapointment. as far as i'm concerned, misfits are dead, and no one can change that, but glen danzig. i definately do not recommend this album to any one with good taste."
5,"Old or new, The Misfits will remain number one","While fans who have been listening to the Misifts since the Danzig days will, undoubtably, reject this album as complete garbage, fans of the newer punk scene (by the way, no where did I mention Ska, so you know that I'm talking about REAL punk) as well as metal/hardcore fans, should enjoy the album to a great extent. Michale Graves may not be a substitute for Glenn Danzig, but if the Misifts never were, and some new band released the album ""American Psycho"", even die hard Misfits fans have to agree that they'd think it was pretty good. This was the album that got me into the Misfits, and from there, I also got into their old stuff. Personally, I feel as if it's is just as good as any of their old albums overall."
1,it isn'the misfits. I'd give it 0 stars if it were an option,"... Old school mifits fans such as myself don't just dislike new school misfits because danzig is missing, but because ""Michale Graves"" ... has a truly annoying and skiddy voice. I don't mind the song Monster Mash as much because Jerry Only is singing. See, I totally respect Only and Doyle for the fact that they are still going hard as ever... Get a new name! OR drop ... Michale ... and have Jerry sing then at least the band would be fronted by an actual misfit! ... buy [the] MISFITS Collection 1&2, as they are more or less all encompassing of the REAL MISFITS career! Admit it, when a front man leaves, it just isn't the same band anymore!"
4,Some of the Best Music is still Unknown...,"Thats how I describe this album. It irks me to no end that this woman is practically unheard of (at least here on the east coast). I first saw Garrison Starr at Lilith Fair 98' on a second stage between the main acts. Later on I purchased this cd in a used record shop. Talk about a gem covered in dirt. From the take off track Grounded, your attention is caught. Rocking guitars, powerful lyrics and quite simply GOOD MUSIC is all it takes to grab you. Garrison is not about glitz and glam. She's just a gal with her guitar and a bit of soul. If your reading this ad, please go on and buy this album, you will be truly satisifed."
5,timex does it again!,"this timex watch has done a very difficult thing , it pleased my wife. The cavatina looks good and has performed flawlessly."
3,Timex Women's Classic Cavatina Expansion Watch #T21882,"Timex Women's Classic Cavatina Expansion Watch T21882: I returned the watch, since I wanted a white watch face with real numbers. The face was a pearl rather than a flat white. The pearl background distorted the view of the numbers, since it reflected the light hitting the face of the watch. I have had a Timex watch exactly like this one but with a flat white background on the face, so that is what I expected. From the picture on the website it was impossible to see that the face was not what I wanted. I have a small wrist and do not want a big watch, so the size is good. And, I do not want to fight with putting the watch on my wrist, so the expansion band is perfect. If your eyesight is better than mine, the watch may be what you want."
4,Good watch for the money,My wife wanted an inexpensive watch to wear for every day work and play. This watch looks good and appears to be durable. The fit and finish are good and the stainless steel band fits perfectly.
5,a wow watch,"i gifted it to my sister, she loved it. I loved it, her husband liked it.a great looking watch. but the waring hand should be small because it is a small, thin watch."
3,Not Small Enough - Dimensions,"I have extremely small wrists, and was looking for a watch with an expansion band to replace one I had a few years ago which fit perfectly. You won't find the dimensions of the watch anywhere - Timex support wrote me only that it will fit ""up to a 6-1/2"" wrist."" The actual dimensions are: watchband - 6"" x 1/4"" (3/8"" at widest end); face - 15/16"" x 11/16"". A jeweler said he'll only charge about $5 to remove bands so that it fits, so that's good news. The watch is okay - nothing special, larger than what I had hoped for, the face looks a little bulky to me, but it'll be fine. Note that the numerals are gold also - easy enough to read, but not as easy as black."
3,pjw,"This watch is very attractive and, in fact, looks much better than the catalogue photo. It was a Christmas gift so I've been wearing it since 12/25/09 and I've noticed it's starting to loose time. Otherwise I would have rated it higher. Don't like the hassle of returns so will deal with it unless it gets worse."
2,IT BROKE,I bought the ring and the first time he put it on his hands were sweaty and the metal left a mark on his finger. He then wore it for three weeks and it started to crack and finally broke. I would not recommend this ring at all.
3,you get what you pay for.,"very nice ring on the outside, but the inside of the ring does not reflect the same craftsmanship on the outside. No one will see the inner surface of the ring when it on someone`s finger but it does deflate the overall satisfactions of the product. The price of the ring is very favorable and if it was made from a more expensive metal and had this quality of work put it, i will truly be disappointed but at this price, I have little room to complain. you get what you pay for and i do enjoy it."
4,Coiled snake ring,"I bought this ring long time ago and is very peculiar and original a little uncomfortable in the beginning and it looks cheap, but i like it."
4,"Brief songs, somber instrumentals, beautiful simplicity","I'm a big fan of the Eels, especially their first works (Beautiful Freak, Electroshock Blues, and Daisies of the Galaxy). This score is an excellent compilation, much of which is based on the same few basic melodies. These deceptively simple patterns unfold into a beautiful variety of music. Check out my favorite track from the album ""Haunted Piano #1"" for a sample. ""Running the Bath"" is probably most representative of the overall tone and feel of the album. Levity's brevity (gwah hah hah!) is the only downside. All but 2 of the tracks fall into the one to two and a half minute mark, making some of them seem like samples instead of full tracks. Given the ambient nature of the pieces they really should go on longer. Definately go for it if you are a fan of the Eels or any other tingly, experi-pop-orchestrock. Keep in mind most of the album is instrumental, in case you need ""singing or guitars"" to enjoy music."
3,"Great bowls, but IMPOSSIBLE to remove label","Great bowls, but after picking, peeling, scrubbing and soaking, there are still remnants of the label on the inside of the bowl."

1,wouldn't know,"Since I never recieved this, I really wouldn't know how to review it. The ""seller"" just stole the money, and hasn't responded to any emails, plus amazon hasn't stepped in to do anything about it despite emails that I've written. So this gets a zero"
4,"Stupid, but funny","It was funnier than I expected. Not a gotta have it movie, but a pretty good movie nevertheless."
2,love guru,little bit funny little bit good if you like this kind of stuff maybe its a three star other wise its not that good. in year 2011 think would have better stuff not just better special effects
3,ok,"i can't review this item because its blu ray which was my ordering mistake, so i could not review it. the seller was very quick to respond and mail absolutly great service from the seller. thank you"
2,The Love Guru (Two-Disc + Digital Copy),"The movie is just like all other Mike Myers movies - stupid, but they are still likable. This one is different, it isn't. It is short, dull, and just 'blah'. It is like Austin Powers, but it isn't as good or funny. This one has lots of the fart, 'pee', 'poo', and bodily fluids jokes that everyone hated inMeet the Spartans (Unrated 'Pit of Death' Edition), but at least Meet the Spartans was good. I maybe crazy for liking Meet the Spartans, but Love Guru just sucks. Like every one of these ""stupid movies"" they always have to have a cameo with the actor stars in the movie...Mike Myers is also casted as 'Himself' in the movie.DVD Review: Why does it say ""SPECIAL EDITION"" on the DVD cover? This is not a Special Edition, it is the single disc edition with a digital copy on Disc 2. If you are debating if you should get the single disc edition for $5 or the ""'SPECIAL EDITION'"" for $8, save yourself the $3 bucks, you won't be using it after watching the movie!"
2,Disappointing!,"Mike Myers plays the role of a Canadian Indian guru who was asked to visit Canada and help a hockey player get back to his girl friend so he can play well again and help his team win. He succeeds in his mission, and he also falls in love with Jessica Alba and gets her to live in India with him.I don't remember laughing at this film. Even though I was prepared to laugh, however this film didn't do it for me. Perhaps the reason is the excessive jokes based on proverbs that are not even funny.It is quite disappointing that after the hilarious ""Austin Powers"", Mike Myers returns to us with the Love Guru.Didn't like it, and I don't recommend buying it."
1,"No Karma, No Laughs","Mike Myers' latest attempt to emulate the comic genius of Peter Sellers falls painfully flat. With the proper script and direction, ""The Love Guru"" concept would have been ideal for Sellers in the late 1960s. Though Myers deserves a little credit for trying something different, the material simply isn't there."
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! AHHHH AMAZING!,I LOVE THIS MOVIE I COMPLETELY AGREE THIS MOVIE IS NOT VERY FUNNY TO ME BUT MY HUSBAND LAUGHS HIS CHEEKS OFF SO IT DEPENDS ON YOU I PERSONALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE YOU JUST CANT GET TIRED OF IT ITS VERY ENTERTAINING I AGREE WITH OTHER VIEWERS ITS A LIL MORE STUPID BUT IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH AT LEAST ONCE BUT ITS VERY ENJOYABLE TO WATCH! WITH THE FAMILY ITS A NICE MOVIE MIGH NOT BE HILARIOUS BUT IT HAS ITS THING AND I PERSONALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE DONT GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT NEITHER DOES MY HUSBAND SO I THINK IT WAS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY. :)
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. Its pure trash. It's just not funny. The jokes are awkward and usually offensive. Honestly, who makes midget jokes anymore? Perhaps this is great according to the 12 year old demographic but to all others, STAY AWAY! I ended up spending 10 dollars on this... thing, and i would like to stop others from giving them anymore."
1,Painfully Unfunny!,"What a major disappointment! A painfully unfunny movie with Mike Myers laughing at his own recycled jokes. I was a Mike Myers fan and was delighted with his first and last Austin Powers movies; I was looking forward to something along those same lines. However, what I got in the ""The Love Guru"" is a series of juvenile jokes and attempts at humor which fail miserably. I stopped watching it after 20 minutes. ""The Love Guru"" is a complete waste of talent, time and money."
2,A Strange Kind of Love,"Mike Myers has made some strange movies, and this one follows suit. His demeanor of importance, his colorful costumes, sparkling eyes and long hair with beard make him appear as another Charles Manson. The premise of the whole movie is about a man's anatomy. He came from India to California to work his magic on a hockey player. The faux India was well done.The whole movie used euphemisms of mascalinity, using words and phrases only weird men recognize and sends them into orgies of wicked laughter."
2,You'll pray for the sweet relief DEATH will bring,"This has to be one of (if not the worst)movie ever made. I normally like Mike Myers' movies but this one was torture. Except for one line near the end, I didn't even crack a smile much less laugh through the entire brutal experience.This movie is to funny, what Gitmo is to luxurious accomodations. In fact, I would rather have been waterboarded than forced to watch this drivel. Amnesty International should take action against the film-makers for this monstrosity.PLEASE, save yourself the agony...slam your hand in a car door, soak it in vinegar then light it on fire, put out the fire with salt and you'll save yourself some torment."
5,"Mariska Hargitay, your Holliness","This movie it's hilarious, very character was very natural and somewhat realistic, it's really funny...."
1,A disappointment,"Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka, a spiritual leader who's tired of being ""the poor man's Deepak Chopra"". He's hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs because they think the only way they can win the cup is if their star player gets back with his wife and they hope Guru Pitka can get them back together.From Mike Myers, creator of Wayne's World and Austin Powers, I'd expect a solid comedy, but ""The Love Guru"" was obviously not written on one of his good days (Myers and cowriter Graham Gordy ""won"" a Razzie Award for worst screenplay). The story is weak but in comedies like this the characters and jokes are often more important than the story. Unfortnately, Guru Pitka is nowhere near as funny as Austin Powers for instance, and the jokes often fall flat, with some exceptions. Ben Kingsley's talents are wasted in an unfunny role as an older guru. 1+"
3,Not nearly as bad as some of the reviews would indicate,"I've read some pretty harsh reviews on this movie, and I can see why, but personally, I've seen 100's of movies worse than this. In fact, I didn't even think it was all THAT bad.What separates us all as human beings, is that we have unique tastes. Clearly, not everyone is going to be entertained by this movie, but I bet a good percentage of you out there would think it's a so-so movie, just as I thought. It had highly entertaining moments. Some very slow moments, some pretty stupid moments, but overall, it was a 3 out 5 star movie, in my opinion."
4,Underestimated...,"Yes. It is. Is was actually good. You might like this if you liked Austin Powers. It does have gross out humor (ie.Elephants doing ""it"" and a line like ""Liquor in the front, poker in the back"") but it was still enjoyable. I watched this with 2 other people and they both liked it. One of them even said it was better than Austin Powers jokes and gags. So. At least give it a try. Don't judge before you see though."
1,What the....?,"This movie I believe had so much promise...so what happened? I love the Austin Power Movies, this I believe could of been something just as if not funnier than those movies. I just found myself thinking all the gags were stupid, not stupid funny, just stupid."
2,missd the mark,"Normally I enjoy Mike Myers and he did a solid with his Austin Powers trilogy, but unfortunately the same cannot be said about this film. It is supposed to spoof off mysticism and being a guru, and some parts are funny like the transporting pillow, but so many things were off the mark that they simply were not funny, period, such as the bit with the soaked mop or the chastity belt. It started off funny, but by the end, was painful."
5,wonderful comedy,"Classic Mike Myers comedy with a middle Eastern slant. Well done. Great job on the supporting roles, and cameos. I am the proud owner of this movie and gladly share it with friends and family."
4,LG,"Came brand new in packaging, works great. A must have for any collection. Great movie. A good buy for the money"
1,An awful disappointment,"What a hideous movie. I adore Mike Myers and this was completely awful. I could not get passed the first 15 minutes--it was lame, forced, disgusting humor. I enjoy toilet humor, but this was not even close to being funny. In fact, I have never written a review on Amazon, but this movie was so bad, I felt compelled to do it."
1,mike myers raises the bar,"for possibly the worst movie ever made,just the pitswhat was mike myers thinking? this movie is so unfunny it is sad,it is also sad since we all know what he is capable of, the first two austin powers film were VERY funny, this is just dumb humor and no plot to speak of, a waste of everybody's talent all the way down to ben kingsley,this movie makes eddie murphy comedies seem like shakespeare"
1,Worst. Movie.EVER!,"Not sure what compelled my husband to rent this weird, non-comedy, but it was a huge mistake to pay anything for this garbage!!! It is simply a terrible movie. For every joke that's funny (which are VERY few) there is about dozen that are not. Then there's all the jokes we've seen in previous Myers films that aren't so funny the 4th time around when they appear in this flick. Guru Pitka (Myers) is not funny or likable. The other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with either. Many moments in this film will having you looking around the theater wondering if anyone else finds this movie as stupid as you do."
5,Digital copy code,i love this movie but... i need the digital copy code can anyone help a brother out ??? lol
1,Good luck w/ translation,Obviously the instructions for this were written in another country. Some words completely mispelled. This may explain why screws and bolts were used interchangably and the parts list did not match with the number of times in the instructions that they told you to use it. (i.e. part B was a bolt and only supposed to have 2 but in the instructions were told to use at least 6 times. Some bolts/screws completely missing. Going to try to return to the store.
1,Terrible Enginering,"This bed has the worst design of any piece of furniture I've ever seen! The pieces do not fit together and the holes for the screws and bolts do not line up. It is impossible to put this piece of garbage together! After several frusterating hours, we returned it to the store. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,"I thought I bought it at a tool store, not a toy store","I'm venting, admittedly. This is the most worthless tool I've ever had the opportunity to hold. It has one job, to grip the rivet stem and pull. No amount of adjustment causes it to grip the stem enough to actually pull and spread the rivet. After lots of adjustment, and several reset-and-squeeze steps, one rivet was spread, sort of. Then, no other rivets would grip at all. I used stanley rivets designed for this riveter. Correct size. In short, don't buy this toy. Buy a real tool. Perhaps Stanley makes a real riveter also. :)"
3,Not particularly happy with it,"Not bad, but too many times it incompletely expands the rivet. I've tried several different brands and qualities of rivet, so I don't think the blame lies there - this gun just on occasion blows, say one rivet in five. Which is... annoying, but not a threat to my lifestyle. I picked this up for occasional use. If I were relying on a rivet gun daily, this would NOT be my choice..."
4,good for small repair jobs,I got this to repair a leather tool belt. I've used similar riveters and this one works well. I did forgrt to order washers for the back and had to pay for overpriced washers at the local parts store.
5,It changed my life.,"It changed my life, after reading this book I decided I had to meet Sadhguru, and I did... and it changed my life completly in ways I would of never imagined."
5,Karmic adjustment,"I'm just back to US after attending one of Sadhguru's Inner Engineering programs in Coimbature, India, but with this book one wouldn't have to go all the way to India to profit from his sage philosophy and practical advice. (And, yes, his Isha Foundation has begun giving such programs in the US now as well.) In it, the age-old questions of Who am I? Why am I here? How shall I be in the world? are given a good tossing and turning. Very inspiring. A valuable read for any ""seeker."""
1,Fades fast,"The price of this crummy game seems to constantly fluctuate- it even went for almost sixty dollars at one time but I would be ticked if I had spent five on it!Graphically the game is good, and it is fun, initially,to explore all the environments and various game elements.But that doesn't save it. Aside from being virtually impossible to win any of the scenarios, the game play itself is boring, unchallenging and falls into a serious rut after you have played it three or four times.If your computer uses Vista- don't bother- it won't run at all- the install screen freezes and goes no further.Sorry to say, the demo was more fun to play than the game."
1,Trailer trash...,"It was inexpensive, so I should have expected to get what I paid for. But, I didn't even get that! Don't bother. I don't.... I played it once, and I was disappointed, later I gave it another chance, but I was right the first time."
1,....,Don't wast your money.I got this game at Bestbuy for $....When I got home I downloaded it on my computer.I played it and it was stupid.It dosent even have a tutorialon it.My advice to you is to not get it.
1,This game is as trashy as the people they make fun of!,The best way to say this is: This game SUCKS!That is all
1,Dissapointed,"When I read the first two reviews for this game I bought it, thinking it might be fun. I was wrong. It's horrible. It's boring after the first five minutes. All you can do is put trailors down and then you have to keep putting things around the trailor to keep people happy. You can't see the inside of the trailors or see the people interact with eachother or their homes. This game is REALLY bad, don't waste your money."
4,Decent for a Tycoon game,"Bought full version and enjoyed it for a few days.. It is great for those who want a quick game, but I like the drawn out scenerios like Civilization, Sim City and Roller Coaster Tycoon.I do recommend it, but be warned if you desire deep thought sims."
3,Fun but could use some work,I actually enjoy this game but I admit it could use some work. There should be more themes to play and just a better quality over all. It is a great laugh and it's amusing until you beat everything! It's not expensive so if you are bored and want a few laughs I reccomend it.
2,Not Worth All the Trouble it Takes to Install!,"This game is tacky, and I assume is thought to be funny by some people. Installation was a nightmare. Overall, the gameplay is hardly entertaining and gets old very, very quickly. It's obvious that the creators of this game did not take the proper amount of time to truly make it fun. The overall concept is great, but the actual game is absolutely not!"
3,A hoot to play!,"'Ya gotta love a game with it's tongue planted firmly in cheek.Personally I don't play games on my computer, the last one I bought was 'Riven'I just wish there was the ability to have a totally free-form mode to play with no set time frame.The 'decorative' items I wish there were more of, as well as Amenities and Trailers. I was so hoping to craft 'Lawn Flamingo Acres' with *tons* of these pink plastic horrors all over the place.....but alas!.....no.Nevertheless it's still pretty fun."
1,"Disappointing, to say the least.","I am running a system with Windows XP, and this game will not run. All I get is a Truth Engine error message, then the program shuts down. Have had no response from tech support at Jaleco. I would not buy this particular title, or any title from Jaleco in the future."
5,Wow! A sleeper hit!,"I downloaded the demo version of this on a lark 'cause it sounded kind of funny. What a surprise I got when my girlfriend and I both loved playing it. In fact, we've been taking turns playing it for two straight days now. I've called all around trying to get my hands on the full version and everyone in my area is sold out. The last person I talked to at one of the EB's said the game is being highly sought after by many. I guess a lot of folks found the demo as much fun as we did. I can't wait to get my hands on the full version. Great job jaleco! Hope to see more good stuff in the future!"
2,That's All There Is?,"Like the Amazon review stated, the first thing that jumps out at me is that this disc only contains 43 minutes of music. One of my music industry pet peeves is ""best-ofs"" that don't fill up all the disc, so strike one was struck.Having only heard four Madness songs before buying this, I can't be as critical as staunch fans, who understandably might find this disc provides better value as a coaster. But, I was ticked that ""House of Fun,"" my favorite Madness song, was nowhere to be found."
3,For the casual fan.,"If you are only familiar with Madness' few U.S. hits (""One Step Beyond"" ""Our House"") this is probably the collection for you. The CD captures the basics of the sound this group put out and the influences they have had on many other bands, (Mighty Mighty Boaatones, No Doubt, Smashmouth) is evident even on this limited set. As you can read in the other reviews, this was a band that deserves a much more complete compilation. Hopefully, this CD will make you want more Madness. If not, this is a good addition for anyone who might want to broaden their musical taste to include one of the best ska bands ever."
3,You Don't Need This,"The best of Madness has a lot more than just this 12 songs. I don't have this CD but from the short song list I know there are better Madness CDs, for starter look for Madness Ultimate Collection, there are 19 songs in it, not complete yet, but better than this.Note for casual listener, In Business Box Set contain interview/commentaries between each song, very annoying.Five stars for the band, 3 for the lack in quantity."
2,"Oh, come on!","I hesitantly give this two stars. It's a ""Best Of"" collection. So where's the best??? This CD needs a much better selection of tunes."
5,well machined - works fine,"#2morse <> 33 Jacobs has been a standard arbor size for as long as i've been on the planet, so as one might expect the quality manufacturers have the machining down pat. Drill Chuck Arbors does a good job with this arbor. It fit perfectly into my two #2 Morse quills, and all of my 33 Jacobs chucks that I tried it with with no detectable runout. I got this arbor so I could swap chucks easily on my Powermatic 2800 drill press with tang arbor release. It's a lot easier to swap arbor with chuck attached than separate the chuck from the arbor. This inexpensive arbor is just right for this application.I have no problem at all recommending these arbors to woodworkers and machinists with quality drill presses and lathes. These seem to be as well machined as the more expensive arbors I have. I'm no metallurgist, so I can't comment on the quality of steel, etc.Recommended without reservation"
4,arbors,"Great price for the arbor. I have installed it, haven't subjected it to any real stress yet but, so far, so good."
1,BEWARE - NOT the original Magnalite!!!,Please be aware that this item is not the original life-long Magnalite that many of us have grown up with but an inferior product made in China. I received this piece today and knew immediately that it was not the same as my many other Magnalite pots just by the lightweight feel of it. I turned it over and on the bottom was stamped China. The authentic Magnalite pieces have been and are still produced by the American Culinary Corporation - here in the USA.
2,Disappointed,"I installed two of these in beach bike wheels. While pumping one of them up to set the bead, the tube blew out at only about 20 or 30 PSI. It blew near the stem. Examining the rubber around the hole, I found that the rubber was much thinner there than the rest of the tube. I was in a hurry, so didn't fool with returning to Amazon. A trip to Walmart solved my problem and was able to get riding that day. I just hope the other tube lasts the summer. I won't purchase these again due to the quality."
2,Could be better,I ride my bike about 25 miles a day and i bought these a couple of months ago after my old tube finally needed to be replaced after a couple years. This new tube however has been punctured 3 times since i bough it. I wish these were a bit more durable.
2,How Long SHOULD this last?,"I ride a mountain bike two miles each day on paved roads. I got these tubes at the bike shop for $4.50 each. They told me ""We put these in all of our bikes."" OK, so they last me about four months. Is that an adequate service life? You distance riders would know better than I, but considering the easy treatment I give them, I feel they should last longer. Thank you."
1,"Defective, waste of time and money","I didn't listen to the other reviews, assuming that a few people probably just had bad experiences with the product. I got the tube, put it in my tire and inflated to the minimum recommended PSI/acceptable level of firmness. A few hours later I got on my bike, and the moment I sat down the tire exploded.I found the tear right near the seam, obviously a defective tire. Really frustrated about the wasted time waiting for the tire to arrive, and now having to wait again to find another replacement. Definitely going to spend the few extra bucks this time to get a tube of greater quality and reputation.Don't waste your time buying this tire."
1,Popped on the first bump...,"Yep.... 1.5 miles from home and ran over a small hole in the sidewalk and my pleasant ride turned into a walk back to the apt with a flat rear tire. Patched it twice, just to keep leaking and ruining my rides... Lesson learned. Upgrade the tubing in your bike tires."
5,Works,Well. It works. My front tire seems to be holding air pretty well and I replaced the tubing pretty easily.
1,Broke 1st day of use,"This one had a flat on the first day of use. I am not sure whether it was low pressure, too many rocks/roots that day, but sure didn't like it (could have happened to any other brand but too bad it did to this one so there's no way to compare)"
1,Seams split,At full pressure 2 out of 4 tubes suffered catastropihic failures - the seams developed splits. I wouldn't purchase them again.
3,Goot but not great,"It's good and it is easy to use, but it is not sharp enough and sometimes splinters my cat's nails."
2,Too cumbersome for small animals,"This was the first clipper I bought once I adopted my cats. It worked fine for the adult, no real complaints there. It was much less useful with the kitten, however. The blades on this clipper are actually quite thick (in all directions, really) and so it is extremely difficult to navigate a kitten's small nails. It also makes it much harder to see how much of the nail you're actually cutting. And if your cat is even the least bit squirmy, well forget it. As I said, it's adequate for adult cats, who are usually used to the procedure and easier to deal with, and generally does a good job on adult nails, with some minor splintering. I'd recommend trying out another product."
1,Poor quality product,"Overall I had no problem cutting my cat's nails with this trimmer, but after owning it for only 4 months the thing simply disintegrated in my hands! I literally just picked it up and was preparing to trim my cats nails, when I gave the trimmer a test squeeze to make certain I had a good grip on it and the plastic handle came apart. I don't mean that the pivot joint came undone, the plastic broke clean through without even making an audible 'snapping' noise. The blade and spring promptly fell out as well and on closer inspection I realized that the handles of the trimmer have no metal reinforcements, they are made out of a simple cheap plastic that apparently is prone to decay.Spend a few dollars more and buy an all metal trimmer from a different manufacturer."
3,Worked fine but broke after maybe 10 uses.,"Originally, the cut was fine, but it broke after only a few uses. The spring just came flying out of it. I never used it improperly, so I cannot figure out why it would break so soon. Additionally, as my cat's nails have gotten thicker, it has been cutting less effectively. It does splinter them a bit."
1,WAIST OF MONEY!!!,"I bought these today at our local pet store and they are going right back tomarrow! This was the first attempt to cut my cat's nails and, though she was patient with me, they left her nails jagged and rough. I thought it was my technique, so I tried several different ways and none of them worked! These things cost me $14.99, too!!! I'm going to try the Millers forge pet nail clipper on this site or ebay...which ever is cheaper. It had good reviews and might actually work!!! This product is a waist of money."
3,Pleasurable prose...,"Ishiguro's prose is sweet stuff. It's too bad that this plot is somewhat thin and unrealistic. The story abounds with interesting characters, some fully realized, some hollow. His obvious study of period history serves him well, and his descriptions of British colonial attitudes rings true. What a treasure trove of novel material exists in the China between the world wars! We are given a glimpse of it in this story. Ishiguro is developing his craft and has a way to go yet, but his book is still an enjoyable reading experience. I look forward to seeing how he develops his plots. When he gets that aspect together, he's going to be in the big leagues."
1,A Total Disappointment,"After reading Remains of the Day, I couldn't wait to begin another novel by Ishiguro. What a waste of time. The plot leads nowhere and the author tidies things up in the last two chapters with an explanation given by a third party. One has the feeling the author himself didn't know how the story would turn out, just kept writing until he got tired of it all."
1,When We Were Orphans,"""When We Were Orphans"" is passionless. My sister and I both received the detective novel for the holidays, and when we discussed it over lunch the other day, I discovered that I was not alone in my confusion about key plot points and storytelling devices - and my lack of empathy and sympathy for its protagonist. I always break the binding of books with a desire to love them - not find fault in them. I do not often feel as dissatisfied as I did while reading and after finishing ""When We Were Orphans""."
4,"Slow, but worthwhile?","I so enjoyed ""Remains of the Day,"" but had a lot of trouble getting involved with the characters and story, or lack of coherent story line, of ""When We Were Orphans."" It picked up speed and interest toward the end, but I remain confused as to who these people actually were and why we should care about their quest."
2,Remains of the Day ---this was NOT,"As I was interested in this book from a NPR review that I heard on the way to work one morning and purchased it on that basis, I was extremely disappointed when I completed the read. Better time could have been spent doing a variety of other things.... I enjoy the intricacies of English culture/life as much as the next reader but find it unhelpful when it is used as filler and does not appreciably add to the story line. I kept reading on waiting for the plot to improve and for some unusual chain of events to reveal some insight that would make the torture of what I had been laboring through worth the struggle...it never happened and by the time I suffered through the end of this weak but complex tale, I was assured that it will be my last effort with this author as life is TOO SHORT to waste it on drivel..."
2,slow moving tale,"The timing in this story is achingly slow, compared to many of today's novels...the language is not particularly metaphorical or even colorful, although the sentences are short. But lacking dialogue it remains dull, dull and I am unable to visualize the characters - more description is needed, and frankly, if it wasn't for previous success he may not have been published. I feel you have to be an anglophile to appreciate this book."
2,went wacko,"I thought this book had promise; it reeled me in early on. BUT, although it was very well-written, it went too wacko for me. Figuring out what the author meant during some (long!) flights of fancy after a fairly straightforward beginning was too wearing. Not worth it for this reader."
2,"Beautifully written but the storyline is simply absurd, the events are preposterous,","and it reads like a story a child might write. A very very talented child as far as literary style, but nevertheless a child."
3,"Intensely well written, but the ending didn't measure up.","The beautifully woven words and the images it invoked was the reason I couldn't put the book down. I was enthralled, but there was something incredibly random and weak about the main character's development, and the ending just didn't measure up to the initial build-up. Of course, it's entirely possible that the author intended a somewhat bitter-sweet ending (or as I'd call it, the deflation of the plot balloon) that would leave the reader in postpartum depression, but I wish I hadn't followed the expectations built by the book itself."
2,I was angry when I finished it,"This is the first book that made me angry upon finishing. It started out promisingly and then turned into something that is hard for me to describe. Ridiculous might be a good word. the two stars are for the writing style because it is very prettily written, too bad we are left not knowing why the author bothered."
1,Snore,"We read this book for book club, with high expectatations. 6 out of 6 women agreed that they had never met a character more unlikeable than that of Christopher Banks - self involved, conceited, and lacked any self perception!!Additionally, the characters did not tie together at all. What was the point of Jennifer? How absurd was it that Christopher stumbles across his long lost friend Akira just in time to force him on to a house where he honestly believes his parents were being held captive for something like 30 years?The most interesting character was Sarah, who was also the only figure with any character development along the way.Skip this book. A big waste of time."
2,Disappointing,"Slow to start. About 2/3 into it, it looked like it would all come together.Ending disappointing.I would not recommend it."
3,A less that remarkable book from a much admired writer,"When I recently finished reading this newest book from Kazuo Ishiguro, I must admit, I was disappointed. Having read all of his other novels, I found this somewhat alarming.The first problem with this book is that the plot doesn't flow like Ishiguro's other works. There are too many points that seem inserted for suspense which seem to cheapen the reading. Second, it fails to achieve the expected high in psychological awareness of Ishiguro's other works.Perhaps Ishiguro is simply trying to expand his style to include more physical, less emotion-driven, plots, but he fails to convince that his heart and talent are fully at work.While this book is certainly readable, and perhaps enjoyable, its interest and literary value are below what a devoted reader of Ishiguro would expect."
1,Disappointing,"Having read Remains of the Day I was excited to see that he had written a new book. The first chapters were interesting as they described his boyhood friend and their days of play.The final chapters were disappointing. Expecting to find his parents after 22+ years of no contact really left me amazed that he expected to find them. Improbable and this got in the way of the enjoyment of the story.It was as though it was written by a student of his, using his signature. I won't rush to read the next one if this is what I can expect."
3,I think the Booker tag is irrelevant.,"I've heard the Booker always goes to books that are one-off from the winning (or nominated) author's actual masterwork. This book is no exception. I think Ishiguro is a fantastically compelling writer - I want to read all of his books just to read what he's written, rather like I'll see even bad films by directors I love just to experience their whole oeuvre - and, while 'Orphans' isn't all that great shakes, it's definitely enjoyable and well-done. The unique style of his voice and his sure touch still makes for a good read."
3,"The first part's great, the second part isn't....","I was thrilled by the first half of this book. The setting, the mysteries of the missing parents, the childhood friend, the strange femme fatale, the boyhood fascination with detective work...great subjects, great writing. Then he goes back to his childhood home of Shanghai and - spends most of it stumbling through a war-torn slum, with putrifying bodies, rats and his old friend who is probably (and very un-subtly) NOT his old friend. Interminable and improbable, and NOT great writing. The only thing intriguing in the last part (which, actually, I would call intensely confusing) was his meeting up with his evil uncle and the solving of the mystery of his parents. I did like that S&M fantasy-ending. But did it go with the rest of the book? No. Did anything in the last part make sense? No. As I keep asking, over and over in these reviews is: DOESN'T ANYBODY EDIT THESE BESTSELLING WRITERS?"
4,Is the narrator psychotic?,"A boy grows up in Shanghai between the world wars. Then his parents are apparently murdered for running afoul of the establishment and its involvement in the opium trade. The boy fulfills his lifelong dream of becoming a great detective, returning to Shanghai, and re-opening the case. Having recently seen ""A Beautiful Mind"", I was sure that the narrator was psychotic, which was the only way the book really made sense. Unfortunately, in the last chapter, which has a very different feel than the rest of the book, ends are tied together and it becomes impossible to maintain the psychotic theory. Absent the last chapter, I thought the book was extremely well written, and therefore quite readable despite the absence of any characters you can relate to. A chapter on Japanese/Chinese fighting in the slums of Shanghai reads like a nightmare - literally."
4,A Clue to Understanding When We Were Orphans?,"Ishiguro's story, A Village After Dark, in the May 21st New Yorker magazine, expresses in a few pages the relationships and psychological states that Ishiguro deals with in The Unconsoled and When We Were Orphans. It is another variation on his theme and may renew interest in disenchanted readers. If, however, you want true insight, read The Unconsoled. Read without skipping or dashing through this long novel that preceded WWWO. Sure, it's like going into the desert. You will be disbelieving and pugnacious. You will be scared of being bored. Yet when you emerge from its pages, emotionally unshaven and dry of mouth, you will know something you didn't know before."
3,I do get it but...,"I do get what is happening in this novel, but as things are so far from reality it doesn't do for me what I want great literature to do, which is to feel an empathy and bond with the characters in the novel and a reflection on my own and others' lives. This is achieved in ""The Remains of the Day"" which I just read and which also relies on the unreliable narrator method. But Stevens only suffers from what I think are the normal errors of the mind in reconstructing history, while Banks is crazy."
2,sillier and sillier,"The book begins well but becomes sillier and sillier. Conversations are stilted and rather inane. Relationships - such as between Christopher and Sally - never develop in any believable way. By the end it is ridiculous. He leaves Sally for 2 minutes and then goes off to find his parents who have been missing for 30 years! Meets his boyhood friend in the most unlikely of places! Come on.... It is hard for me to believe any reviewer would promote it unless they are basing their appreciation of the book on the author's former works. If an unknown author had submitted it, I doubt any publisher would have touched it. I am finishing it only because the reader - and I am reading it on tape - is very good and I want to see just how unbelievable the ending is."
2,"promises much, but sadly fading towards the end","The first few chapters promise much and the intriguing encounters between Christopher and Sarah were captivating. However, the plot gradually degenerates into an incredible story of a senseless Englishman braving through Japanese shells and bullets to search for his parents, whom he believed were held hostage in a shanty town in the middle of a battlefield in wartime Shanghai for 30 years. But perhaps the most ""intriguing"" part is how the western community in Shanghai seemed to expect Christopher to bring world peace with the solving of the case of his parents' disappearance."
1,An epic mess,"This book is such a grandiose mess that I must remind myself of Ishiguro's great works, such as Remains of the Day, which show what he is capable of as a writer and artist. When We Were Orphans is a small, unpleasant, soapy story set against a gigantic and wildly improbable canvas, as if that will somehow give the story social weight, political size and personal meaning. It doesn't."
5,A real piece of work,"When an off-kilter investigator goes to Shanghai to uncover the mystery surrounding his parents' death, all bets are loose. Is the story you're reading the actual account, or is it all the figment of the leading character's imagination. You'll just have to read and find out. man oh man this is an awesome read!"
2,quite Boring,"I had to plow through this book, which made no real sense after a while. It was soo boring. Full of nonsence information. I always felt that a book that was short listed for the Booker prize could be something more... well ... exciting. It was just boring and it had no real point to the whole story."
1,What am I missing?,"A couple of years ago when this novel was first published in England, I purchased it at Heathrow Airport before getting on my flight home. Unfortunately, it was the only book I had on the plane. Otherwise, I could not have gotten past the first 20 pages. This is one of the worst novels I have ever read. The plot is implausible. The prose is strained. The characters are wooden. It insults the reader's intelligence over and over. Ever put a joke in the middle of a college term paper to test whether your professor would really read what you wrote? I wonder if Ishiguro let someone ghost-write this novel to test the integrity of book reviewers."
3,In a hurry?,"Having read Remains and Artist (though the last one didn't exactly blow me away), I was curious about this one; the storyline sounded rather interesting. But for all of Mr Ishiguro's mastery of English (makes one think of Joseph Conrad) he simply doesn't pull this one off. So his Christopher Banks seems to be a couple of cans short of a six-pack, still his delusions have to face up to reality. Why do the other characters play along (believing his parents to be trapped in the same house for 18 years, or his pompous allusions about defusing the global crisis in the thirties that are never taken up)? For all the original idea, never comes even close to Remains - so read that one."
3,The Clueless Detective,"The narrator and main character of this novel presents himself as a brilliant detective in the mode of Sherlock Holmes. His task is to uncover the mystery of his parents disappearance years before in Shanghai. There is an air of unreality from the very first page, stemming from the narrator's simultaneously self-aware and self-deluded consciousness. We don't believe for a moment that he is a ""detective""; that is, he models himself after a fictional detective and his way of being a detective seems entirely literary. Ishiguro designs each sentence to reveal this paradox of the clueless detective, who never perceives himself the way everyone else sees him. He is almost autistic in his social skills!The novel can be either tedious or spell-binding, depending on one's perspective."
1,What's Ishiguro up to?,"I admit that I have not yet finished the book, and so perhaps should reserve judgement, but I won't. There are so many absurdities, unexpainable assumuptions made by the characters, both major and minor that I finally concluded that Ishiguro was attempting to write somthing Kafkaesque and, for me, only succedding in making Banks and many of the other charactrers appear deliberately obtuse. Like other reviewers, I am terribly bored by the book, which is admittedly very elegantly written, but I am put of by its abusurdity, which is tiresome and not at all compelling."
2,Ishiguro rests on his laurels,"""When We Were Orphans"" has a plot like a third-rate TV mini-series, full of implausible developments, improbable coincidences and loose ends. Ishiguro seems to be trying to make some point about the nature of evil - but quite what it is just doesn't come across. Much that would help us to understand the story is simply glossed over and hence the reader is simply left with too many unanswered questions - though do we care enough about the characters to want them answered?. Christopher Banks is the kind of emotionally constipated, self-deceiving character that Ishiguro seems to specialise in. The growing relationship between himself and Sarah Hemmings simply does not convince. Having read and very much enjoyed Ishiguro's earlier novels, I am extremely disappointed with this novel."
3,Ultimately Unsatisfying,"I was drawn to this book by generally good reviews, the author's prior work and the storyline. I found that I could not put the book down, but believed the plot to be too contrived. I understand that Dickens can get away with charaters popping back into a storyline at the most unexpected time, but when the protagonist in this book finds a long lost childhood friend in the middle of a warzone, it's a bit much. (Maybe he's not who he seems?)And while the narrator claims to be a great detective, there is no evidence of how he works. (Read A Conspiracy of Paper for a much better read about a London detective. Or read Empire of the Son about a boy's traumatic experience in wartorn China.) The narrator's mother also suffers a rather too purient and sadistic demise, and her ending is straight out of ""The Other SIde of Midnight"" by Sheldon (Do all traumatized women end up cared by nuns??) I enjoy this author's work and his mannered approach, but this isn't his best effort."
2,A whodunnit with no who and no it,"After being dazzled by his previous works ""Remains of the Day"" and ""A Pale View of Hills"", I was left disappointed by Kazuo Ishiguro this time around.The book starts out great -- an historical whodunnit mystery about a boy whose parents are kidnapped in Shanghai in the early 1900's, who then returns years later to find them.But this book can't figure out what it wants to be... it's a mystery for awhile, then a romance, then a psychadelic journey into the mind of a sick man. In the end, it fails to satisfy the reader on any of those counts.Furthermore, Ishiguro does a poor job of bringing colonial Shanghai to life in the mind of the reader. That's a real shame, given that Shanghai during this period was one of the most exciting and stimulating cities in the world.Nevertheless I remain a devoted fan of Kazuo Ishiguro. Let's hope that he gets out of this slump and that his next book is as good as his earlier works."
3,An alright book...,"the title is misleading. seeing that the title sounded like something similar to Copperfield, i decided to borrow it. to my dismay it did not turn out to be anything like it. the story itself is a little too far-fetched. however, some parts are written wonderfully and also reveals some insights of Kazuo. worth a read only if u are bored or have a lot of time to spare."
5,"great, intense -- classic ishiguro -","sometimes you read kazuo ishiguro and it seems that he's always playing the same tune -- ""stiff, delusional older guy looks back on life and pieces together a tragic past"" ... but this one proved that ishiguro can do more with his toolkit than just rehash remains of the day. this book is extremely powerful and gripping -- definitely on a peer level with R.O.D. and in some ways stronger."
3,"Elegantly written, but the author held back too much.","This book was very well written, and I felt sorry for the narrator for his inability to express himself or connect with others. The detective format was compelling at first, but Ishiguro gave out so few clues that it became frustrating to try to put the puzzle together."
2,Interesting Failure,"I found this novel to be an interesting failure for two reasons. First, one can't tell if it is the author or the narrator who is incompetent. Second, assuming it's the narrator, the point of his history and delusions remains obscure."
2,Full of plot holes,"I'm guessing that Ishiguro must be on some kind of medication when he wrote this novel. The prose and narration, while top notch, could not compensate for the numerous glaring plot holes.Reading this novel requires one to suspend his disbelief at the events unfolding. The most glaring one is how the protaganist, the renowned detective Christopher Banks, returned to Shanghai after 20 years, to find his missing parents, and for some reason, believes that they are still holed up in a slum house. He also stumbled upon his childhood friend after 20 years, Akira, in a war zone. These, and the way many other things come together for Banks strains credulity.The bright spots in the novel is the little girl Jennifer who is adopted by Banks. Unfortunately, even this lone bright spot was only expanded on until the end of the novel."
2,Perhaps I missed something.,"I couldn't make the connection between the rave reviews on the dust jacket and the writing within. Since the book is loosely a mystery, I wasn't able to toss it aside -- naturally, I wanted to know what happened to Christopher's parents. In the meantime, though, my reading was peppered with exclamations of disbelief and disgust as I forged my way through the book. I never did decide whether the tepid writing and unnecessarily obtuse timeline were more frustrating, or whether it was the ridiculous behavior of the narrator, whose decision-making abilities bordered those of a squirrel. I found the ending to be trite, and many of the characters hollow. Overall, not a positive impression of my first Ishiguro."
4,haunting,"If you have ever recalled a particularly detailed dream that made perfect sense to your sleeping alter ego but was completely incomprehensible by day, this novel will make a certain degree of sense to you in that it makes really no sense at all. Yet it manages to brilliantly recall a forgotten time and place - Bitish mercantile Shanghai from WWI through WWII, and illuminates history and politics that get little attention. This vivid sureal masterpiece is as challenging as it's predecessor The Unconsoled but far more satisfying as a narrative. Highly recomended."
3,"Enjoyable, easy read. Some plot weakness. Mildly thought provoking.",After liking Remains of the Day a few months ago I decided to pick this book up. It reads very fast in part due to some tricks at the end of chapters (ala Ludlum) to push you into the next.The prose is well crafted. There was one key weakness in my view which has to do with the extremely unlikely plot twist where the main character reconnects with his childhood friend. Why would he be fighting for the Japanese army in China? How could one ever believe in the chance meeting described in the book? I'd say it's a small blot on an otherwise satisfactory plot line.For those existentists out there you will find a bit of an echo in the treatment of the main character and his relation to the world and the other people in his life. So at the end the book does leave you with a bit more than just a fun read.
2,A Major Disapointment,"Reading the reviews in Amazon is usually much more informative than reading the marketing blurbs that appear on a book or frankly many of the reviews that appear in the press. The fact that this book was considered for the Booker award, the most important British literary award, is simply shocking. It points out that selling books is like any other business and therefore let the buyer beware. There are few books that I have reacted to so negatively in the last twenty years. The fact that many readers still appear to love the book and consider it a ""masterpiece"" is the only true mystery of this book for me. I suppose many people expect a great book from a popular and successful novelist, but this book in my opinion is a waste of time. It is a silly, illogical book that is also weirdly racist in its belief that the Chinese soldiers involved could have cared at all about this preposterous Englishmen and his missing family. It is not worth reading."
3,From the sublime to the ridiculous,"I had really looked forward to reading this book - many people had recommended it to me, and the premise of the story was an interesting one.This story is a first-person narrative about a detective who returns to Shanghai to find his missing parents. He becomes caught up in the Japanese occupation, to the point that he is involved in actual battles, travelling through destroyed streets with a man he believes to be his childhood friend. The impression i get is that Ishiguro is trying to portray a man losing his grip on reality - the story becomes bizarre about 1/2 - 3/4 of the way through. However, part of me thinks that maybe it is just bizarre. Full stop.I enjoyed the beginning of this book, and i quite like Ishiguro's style. However, i just feel that he literally loses the plot. Which is a shame, as this could have been quite a good book, as opposed to a potentially good book."
1,No Remains of the Day,"I picked this book up because I enjoyed Remains of the Day. The book is, however, arguably the worst book I have ever read.A slow to non-existent plot drags interminably with page after page of tediously detailed description and converstations that do not advance the story one bit.I kept wondering if this was a first novel, brought back to life in order to cash in on the author's current celebrity. It reads like a teenage first try.Simply dreadful. Now, I wouldn't touch any other product by this author with a barge pole."
1,Illogical and unbelievable,"How can a book have such tightly-controlled writing, yet such an illogical, unbelievable and frustrating plot? The narrator is a detective, yet we are given no details on his professional triumphs (we're just told, repeatedly, he's a great detective), and, judging from his lack of memory and inability to focus on essential clues from his past, no reason to think he has the mental acuity to be such a brilliant detective. This novel is both too tight and too loose at the same time."
2,Lost in Shanghai,"Sorry to say that I think this fine writer simply lost his way on this one. After an enticing beginning the whole fabric quickly unravels. The random blind alleys of the plot were not only boring, but infuriating and often totally unbelievable.I finished the book out of respect for his other better works, but can in no way recommend it."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I just finished reading ""When We Were Orphans"", and I was very disappointed. I found the storyline to be silly and unbelievable. What a letdown this was."
2,perplexing,"I try not to be swayed by pre-pub blurbs nor even reviews, but the raves for this book drew me to it, only to be disappointed. It has the oddest combination of sweeping and miniscule pallette. On the one hand, Christopher's inner life is stuffy and confined, almost a cliche of the male English spinister, his passions so tightly cloaked as to be painful, yet the action-sweeping across continents-encompasses war, the machinations of the opium trade, and an excrutiatingly drawn out campaign to solve childhood mysteries. The subplot of Mr. Banks' adoption of Jennifer, while affecting in itself, seems contrived to give resonance to the orphan theme. In the end, I couldn't reconcile the small inner world of this strangely withheld man with his adventures in a the world beyond himself, a world filled with almost numbing action and intrigue."
3,A Pleasant but Disappointing Read,"I was looking forward to this book and while I found it enjoyable, I was disappointed. I love the style and tone of the book. The pace is a bit slow.The story, while loaded with potential, was a bit absurd, with this seemingly intelligent man actually believing his mother is alive after many many years in apparent captivity.I love the grace and style of Ishiguro and when I finished the book, I felt I missed something. Maybe I will find it in a reread."
4,A Master Storyteller!,"It is 1915, Shanghai. A ten-year-old English boy living in the international city, has his life shattered by the sudden disappearance and supposed murder of his parents. He is whisked off to England, attends a boys school and builds a successful life as a celebrated detective. He returns to Shanghai in 1937 to solve his parents' murder, but as the Chinese and Japanese are fighting each other, the reader learns that Christopher's life is a sham and all is not as it appears. So we are suddenly confronted with an unreliable narrator. What does the reader do? Kazuo Ishiguro is never content with surface events or just writing a clever mystery. It doesn't really matter that the plot is not entirely believable. There is a master storyteller at work here, grappling with larger ideas. I will not give away the story, but I guarantee that reading it is a treat. You will not be able to put it down."
1,Unbelievable plot line.,"I love ""The Remains of the Day"" by the same author, but this book was horrible. The plot line is unbelievable. It's like the author didn't even try to convince you that this things could actually have taken place.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House"
2,Spoiler alert - the technique is not my thing,"Unreliable narrator technique is not my thing.I loved Remains of the Day, and picked up When We Were Orphans as soon as it came out. The novel uses the unreliable narrator technique, and I found it both irritating and at times confusing. Mostly irritating. I appreciate the author's dexterity, but I don't want to be part of his experiment ever again."
5,A fairly shattering and wholly mysterious first person narrative of a life lived with intent but without perception.,"A fairly shattering and wholly mysterious first person narrative of a life lived with intent but without perception. It's clear Ishiguro is on a trajectory all his own, and seems again with this book to be some new kind of contemporary but nonetheless prophetic voice, both affirming the legitimacy of and warning of the dangers of something like Richard Rorty's notion of contingency. Fine and suprisingly brisk novel that summarizes and builds beautifully on the author's previous works, and bears repeated readings. Five stars."
3,Doesn't do well in covering the topic,"I had high expectations for this book. Being the nominal sort of Christian, very unhappy non-practicing Roman Catholic, I really wanted to know more. I have read an awesome book called Catholics & Sex by Kate Saunders, Peter Stanford and I like to see stuff. In comparison, wow, I was so not blown away by this book. It doesn't serve my want or need in terms of exploring the roots of anti-woman, anti-lesbian stuff in the Christian church, doesn't offer the historical context I was wanting. It had a lot of personal stories, huge chunks of stories and other writings by women. If it had just stuck with that, included only tales of women feeling marginalized in the Christian faith, I think the book would have been much better."
1,Found Wanting--This Book,"Shows a hideous lack of real knowledge of what Christians truly believe. If you're going to dispute a teaching, at least get straight what they truly teach! Pass on this one!"
2,Mailbox Replacement Flag,"Unfortunately I bought the wrong type of flag. My mailbox needs a TWO hole attachment, which is not available here."
1,Didn't fit,"Maybe I was hoping to just replace my broken flag, but the holes didn't match up to the one in my mail box, so I have to drill new holes and plugin other holes. I was only looking to swap something really quick and the design wasn't as good as what was on my mailbox"
1,30130 Fire Ring,I thought a fire ring should be a circle. There is no way to make this thing into a circle. Worst piece of junk I ever bought. More chinese junk.
1,Poor item!,Very poor construction. I purchased this for my husband and the first time he put it together to use it broke. He was wheeling it down the driveway and the entire leg snapped off creating a hole in the bottom. Do not purchase this! We had another fire pit that lasted for years and was very durable. This was not the same quality and will not last.
1,Don't Buy,"Loved the design, but the bowl is too brittle and will not last. My first one broke at the wheel mount after 6 uses. The replacement (provided free by them after several customer service calls) cracked wide open after about another half-dozen uses. Simply not durable enough to last more than a half-season. I bought this instead:Landmann Northern Lights Outdoor Fireplace[...]"
5,Say Good-Bye to Add and ADHD,"Excellent, sensical read. This author knows her stuff as she has experienced it in her own home. I read the book just to learn and wow did I learn. I have changed my own diet because of some of the quality information that's in here. I highly recommend this book to those who have to deal with these issues in there home. Be patient as you read this. She gives you a lot of good information and it can be overwhelming. Certainly a book for every household."
3,needs work,The overall problem with this dvd is that it gives only a general idea of the procedures. California has some stringent rules to follow for licensing and this video doesn't pinpoint those requirements. It is too general if someone is looking for specific information in order to pass the skills test for California licensing. Other than that the quality of the video is very good.
4,"A bit of this, a bit of that..","A little bit of THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, a little bit of A SCARLET LETTER..and even a little bit of THE LOTTERY--this first novel by Marlin Fitzawater occasionally conjurs up characters and moments that aren't exactly original, but still, this is a very compelling book. And for anyone who has been to North Central Kansas--hell, for anyone who has NOT been to NCK--this is a perfect description of the world of Post-Rock. And good for him for doing all this research! Ol' Marlin must have some time on his hands!"
5,Very good reading.,"I found this book to be very informative. My only complain is that many topics were a little too broad, i.e. the chapters on Multinational Corps; Internet and Robotics; on Asian Economies etc. However, the insights and ideas found in the book would very much help in policy making. I would recommend this book to all, especially to those who want to be leaders and government officials."
1,Consumer junk,These scissors from the start would not cut paper.Still do not cut worth a darn.I even tried sharpening them on a professional electric sharpener and it was no use.Pure junk from a good name brand.I was surprised by this product.
1,Highly Disappointed,"I was looking for a reasoned, critical examination of the texts that deal with war and peace in an attempt to personally develop a theology of the christian's response to war and violence. My intent was to look at one text from a pacifist view and one from a just-war view.Biblical Pacifism was my chose text to understand why we should not engage in war. Unfortunately, there was very little exposition of Old or New Testament texts. It was a write espousing Anabaptist and Brethern theology, with very little critical analysis of the scriptures. When something scriptural seemed to contradict his view, it was just dismissed."
4,It took a while to grow on me.,"I bought this CD because I enjoyed a couple of Lisa's songs on the radio. When I started listening to it, I really only liked about 3 songs. It took a while for the rest to grow on me. But grow on me they did. I know find I enjoy the whole CD.I know Lisa likes putting some odd lyrics in her songs. Sometimes they are a little too odd for my tastes. For instance in Firecracker, there are lyrics about ""you tie your shoe laces, I light firecrackers..."" or something about being a cowboy and tramping around. I understand them, I just think they are sometimes pretty poor lyrics, and that takes away from an otherwise perfectly beautiful song."
2,Eh- why is it so uninteresting?,"I really can't understand it. I loved Tails, was nearly obsessed with it. So why did Firecracker bore me to death? Don't get me wrong, I really liked Jake, This, and Split Second, but on the whole I had no interest in most of the songs. Some of the lyrics just turned me off, seemed cheesy in some parts. After tails, i was pretty disapointed in Firecracker. Don't ask why."
3,wrong choice,"I bought this album and also TAILS on the strength of the reviews included on the page. Wrong choice ! I also gave Lisa a chance because of her new Dweezil & Lisa cooking show and I thought she seemed perky & cute and felt that she probably had music nice to listen to.First .. her albums are not for the over 50 crowd, which I belong to. Second .. every song seemed to be filled with pessimism and doubt and other depressing themes. The tunes were for the most part pleasant. Change the lyrics Lisa ! We all wanna be happy not saddened."
3,A Modest Success...,"In 1997, I would have given this CD 4 and a half stars. In 1998, 4. So, by 2000, this album has clearly outgrown its welcome, and sounds strangely dated for only three years after release.True enough, Loeb maintains her delightful blend of pop and acoustic mixes. Her huge single ""I Do"" was a sugary version of ""I Will Survive"" lyrically, but it was well liked and deservedly so. ""Furious Rose"" and ""Let's Forget About It"" are standout tracks that left me warm to the CD originally, but not even the backing of fantastic singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin can keep this album alive and modern. It rings slightly hollower than when I last played it--which, admittedly, was not recently."
2,RipFlash TRIO - good features - poor perfomance.,"The bad:Headsset connection is intermittent, must hold it to get stereo.Battery life is poor ... with no pushing of buttons got lessthan four hours. Display is very hard to read except for briefseconds after pushing buttons when it is illuminated. Menu controls are poorly done.The good:It looks slick, the sound quality is quite good (stereo separtion while pressing on connection), nice features."
4,OK product with low sound volume and battary capacity,"everything that the other reviewers wrote is correct: the trio is really smallest, and has all features found in more expensive and bigger players.but there arethings that are not good about this player: the volume level is somehwat low - and it is probably because the maker of the trio wanted to save the tiny battary power. it is dead in a short time and needs recharge.The new MP3 players are much better."
2,"Complete in substance, not in format","This little box does indeed contain every datum necessary to speak japanese well. However, all the audio material is placed on two audio cassettes without any repetition. That's the only way to put this much material on two cassettes. I recommend digitizing the tapes, breaking the recordings up into the forty individual lessons, and practicing them repetitively one by one. In that form, there is a lot to be gained from this set. I wish the included dictionary were more literal in its sense of word translation. The great thing about this set is that it is complete at so small a price.If price is not an issue, I suggest Pimsleur for learning competence in a language, but I'm glad I bought this set, just to begin with."
4,"Good, but needs more...","This package, or rather the coursebook, needs further instruction for grammar so you can make up your own sentences completely. There is a little chapter at the end on grammar but its not quite enough. However, this almost-perfect set is well worth the money. Enjoy..."
4,I got 8 of the 9 dvd's in the package,"I love the Puppet Master movies, which is why I jumped at the offer of getting all 9 in one set. It didn't take very long to get the package even though there was some bad weather around the area. When I did get the package, I noticed one thing was missing. ""Retro Puppet Master"" was not in there. Not too happy, but I know it'll get fixed."
1,Yuck,"I had seen these movies back in the 90's when they came out. Unless you are nostalgic, pass these by. They are terrible! I guess I've grown up...."
5,Excellent,"I love this set. I like to buy box sets of movies for the fact that I can usually find them for much cheaper. This set does not disappoint. The box set comes with three standard sized DVD cases inside, and there are three disks to a case. They are their own disk. no double sided discs here. the picture quality and audio is great. The three films equal to approximately 12 Hours and 48 minutes (not including the time for the extras). For the money, this set is well worth it if you enjoyed the movies growing up. I wont bother listing the movies in this set because someone else has kindly done that as well as described each movie."
4,Great set of movies!,"I was about to buy the old collection set a couple of months ago when I saw this one was coming out and decided to wait since it essentially had all the movies in the series. I'm still watching the last few movies, but this is a review about the product and not the movies. Most would have seen them or heard plenty of plot reviews from other sources already. Though I will note the movie quality seems pretty good. So anyway, the DVD's come in 3 volumes, with 3 movies in each volume. I love that each movie gets their own disk (none of that double-sided or multiple-movies-in-one-disk stuff!). I like the scroll design on the disks too. The only reason I'm giving this a 4-star is because the box itself is pretty plain. It would have been nice to have some texture or 2D aspects to it. Or even a stronger box in general. All in all for the Amazon price, I'm pretty happy though."
4,Puppet Master Collection on dvd,"I was suprised and happy to find that though this set is in 33.1 aspect ratio as it was on cable tv.The good news is the first disc IS THE REMASTERED LETTER-BOX ""PUPPETMASTER"" with intro by Charles Band.It is the only movie in 185.1 (aspect ratio) in the set.The price I paid at Amazon was a good deal = $3 per movie!!!!Get this set while you can if you want the Puppet Master movies on dvd.Now to update on this review :The last disc ""Axis of Evil"" is in Letterbox too! 235.1 aspect ratio (Same as Cinemascope) very cool! However ""Legacy "" (eight disc) is just scenes cut from all the other Puppet Master movies with very little new content.All in all,I'm glad I got this set!"
4,Some Words of Warning,"Puppet Master IThis is a new transfer and it looks great. Moreover it is displayed in it's original widescreen aspect. There was however one major disappointment for me. I am partially deaf and there are no subtitles or closed captions. These have become pretty much standard on all DVD's now.Puppet Master II - IXThese films share the problem of no subtitles or closed captions AND are shown in the older television ratio of 4:3 (the screen is boxed on the left and right sides). While you can use most PC DVD software to show it full screen you will lose the aspect and if you turn on Pan and Scan software to correct the aspect, you will lose the top and bottom of the frames.You can say that $30.00 is good for 9 films but I would have paid more for better DVD Mastering."
2,No muscle,"What a disapointment. If you own other vintage commercial DVDs you will have seen most of these. Half the DVD is about the 1954 Chevy. Only one muscle car ad, about 30 seconds long for the Camaro. Don't waste your money. Unless you own a '54 Chevy!"
5,Fistful of Fig Newtons,"Collection of short stories - hilarious. From the guy who wrote the book that 'A Christmas Story' was based on. All very memorable stories written with a wry sense of humor - people who grew up in the late 40's and 50's can really relate and reminisce, but young people will enjoy as well. The story about kids with last names starting with letters at the end of the alphabet forever relegated to the back row of all school rooms and their strategies for going unnoticed by the teacher had me laughing out loud as did the one about working the kitchen car on a troop train. The other people on the plane probably thought I forgot to take my meds. Jean Shepherd's other book 'Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories' is also a classic and contains several of the short stories that were cobbled together for 'A Christmans Story' the movie."
4,worth the price if you're a fan.,"It's not in the same league as Wanda Hickey's night of golden memories or In God we trust, all others pay cash but it still has some classic stories, including one of the last stories of the Parker family, where Ralph is discharged from the military and travels back to his home town for one last adventure. Like most of Shepherd's stories, it's bittersweet and funny."
4,Funny!,"This was the third collection of Jean Sheppard short stories that I have read, and this one was every bit as humourous as the other two. This one focusses more on Sheppard's adult life than his other works, but there are still some stories with the familiar Ralphie, Flick, and Schwarz as well. Equally as funny are his descriptions of hippies driving in vans and college football players. This book is a nonstop laugh riot."
4,High-level orientation to the PHR/SPHR exam,"This book provides a helpful overview to orient a candidate to understanding the look/feel of the PHR/SPHR exam. However, this book will not prepare a candidate for the exam. It provides more sample questions then the free certification handbook and can be a good place to start if you are unfamilar with the exam. However,individuals looking to minimize $$$ spent and interested in certification should consider investing in a good HR text book (try Mathias & Jackson HR text and student resource guide) and/or consider an SHRM study course."
1,Bad representation of a guide,"I was extremely disappointed to see what the Certification Guide had to offer. It simply provides mores sample test questions than the free certification guide that you can download from the shrm website. I still have not taken the exam, but came here to look for a better source to study for the exam. I would not recommend this guide to anyone."
2,wow that is one ugly watch,"Bought it for my wife after I got a TIMEX digital watch with an expansion band for myself, which I really like. This one showed up and we were both in agreement, it is lame. At $20, it's hard to complain, but it's not even worth that if you'll never wear it.PROS:+$20+TIMEX quality, water-resistantCONS:-$20 too expensive-expansion band is way too big for an average female wrist-the numbers are too far from the hands, making it kind of hard to tell what time it is (is that pointing at the 10 or the 11?)-cheap-looking, lame design"
1,garbage,"this is a terribly made watch. a cheap piece of garbage. i ordered it for my mother who had the exact same one but the band had broken. couldn't find a new band so ordered the watch. pulled out the pin to set the watch and it came out completely. so instead, i took the band and put it on her older watch probably not made in the philippines. so it all worked out, but this watch is literally a waste of time."
4,Good basic watch,"I've always liked Timex watches because they are reliable, long-lasting, and can survive some rough handling - and they are reasonably priced, too!This watch is like that. Also, it's easy to put on and take off, and feels comfortable to wear. The only fault I find is that it's a little more difficult to read the face than what I would like."
3,Follow Your Dreams,"Broadcast journalist Dan Rather collected inspirational stories from a cross-section of Americans who expressed their feelings about transforming dreams into reality. Themes include freedom, enterprise, pursuit of happiness, family, celebrity, education, innovation, and service. The recurring theme throughout the book is that America uniquely provides opportunities for one to not only dare to dream but also to actively pursue those dreams. That our visions can come true if we believe in ourselves, accept help when it is offered and work hard."
4,Basement Jaxx - Rooty,"The Jaxx boys bring on Rooty, their second album, and it shares the same strengths as Remedy (catchy melodies, great hooks, infectious grooves) as well as the same weaknesses (aimless filler). ""Romeo"" and ""Breakaway"" start off the album on the right foot, only to be thrown way off course by ""SFM"" -- a pointless track. Things pick back up with ""Jus 1 Kiss,"" a bouncy, joyous song. The whole album seems to go like that: one or two great songs, followed by a not-so-good track (for instance, ""Get Me Off"" and ""Where's Your Head At"" followed by ""Crazy Girl""). Basement Jaxx are both eclectic (a good thing) and inconsistent (a bad thing). On the whole, though, the better songs bear repeated listens."
5,More Jaxx...,"Being a long time fan of Basement Jaxx I had high expectations and once again was not let down. Romeo is of course the cream of the crop but the entire CD shines, catchy beats with great lyrical talents helps this CD last and last."
2,Two songs are awesome...the rest is bad,"I got this CD after hearing the songs Where's Your Head At? and Get Me Off. These two songs are great. I would recommend them to anyone. But the rest of the disc is lacking in many ways. Other than those two songs the rest is pretty terrible. A big disappointment, buy the single not the whole disc."
1,"Sorry, but I don't get it....","While I can't tell you in such a beautiful or complex way that this CD stinks, I can certainly tell you in simple terms... This is one of the biggest tops to flops that I've heard in some time. Not that the Remedy CD was exceptional in my opinion, but it was good... There is no song on this CD that can match ""Red Alert""... Also missing is the Reggae influenced tracks... This is a total mix-and-match beats paradise. The music is highly confusing. The blends of sounds just don't match. And I was left with a strange look on my face after listening to it. The only track that I can say that I fully liked was ""Just one kiss"". Other than that, I can throw this CD away. In what is seen by a creative CD by many, I guess I'm in the minority because I just can't get with this one...."
1,Dissapointing!!,"I bought this CD expecting some decent dance grooves. That was a mistake. There are only two songs on the entire Cd that are worth anything. Most of the songs are just a jumble of vocals and sounds, that lack any build up and have no flow. I can appreciate artistic attempts, but this CD comes across very unrefined, and almost silly. I know that Basement Jaxx has some good sounds, but I think I'll stick to the singles from now on."
4,They keep on doing it,"Basement Jaxx has done it again, with their cool jungle beats, trip-hop grooves, tribal voices, and booming bass, Rooty is the perfect sequel to their fabulous album Remedy. Leaving listeners thirsty before, Rooty is sure to satisfy any hunger for dance iniatiating sounds. This will become a must for any swinging music collection and is sure to become the choice dance album for the summer. A wicked collection of tunes for a wicked group, already i find myself looking forward to the next album."
4,"Its pop, techno, lords of acid... and other stuff?","So its a lot of fun to listen to. Sexy, electronic, dancy beats with a little bit of lounge thrown in. Its a shame that the album doesnt really stand out against a canvas of other vibrant electronic dance music.Dont get me wrong, there really is a lot to like, but nothing really stands out. Its a lot of fun to listen to, and you can safely keep it running in your cd/mp3 player at work or in the car without it either being too distracting or ""getting you down."" Whats more is your coworkers may even like it.Its just ""poppy"" enough that most people will probably like it, and just novel enough that those looking for something a little different will most likely be satisfied.An additional note: most people have told me they like the Remedy album better; I like them about the same."
4,Worth buying,"I'm not into this type of music, however, the track titled ""Where's my head at"" is real catchy. If you want to buy a dance type of cd, then I suggest this one!"
4,You've Come A Long Way Baby...,"The guys in Basement jaxx have gotten better. They didn't just regurgitate Remedy even though it was probably a better CD. The beats are less straightforward house and more disjointed like in SFM. The lyrics are really stupid, but the vocals and totally random sound effects constantly come at you from all sides of the stereo spectrum. They are able to meld strange noises and obscure samples into great music as in Breakaway. Gospel and Hispanic cultural influences are most obvious in Broken Dreams and Do Your Thing. The whole CD is surprisingly unlike Remedy, but the style is more defined and the boys are on top of their game."
3,Lost the edge of Remedy,"I guess the things that people really like about Rooty are the things I don't like. The first track Romeo is almost unlistenable pop. I felt embarassed to play it to friend after I just bought the CD, hyping it up based on Remedy. But the second track (Breakaway) returns to the harder, darker sound of Remedy (except for the annoying Prince-like chipmunk vocals). Crazy Girl is a groovy electro workout, but based on the reviews here, the average fan of Bassment Jazz doesn't get it.All the songs on this disk are songs with lyrics. The comparison to Lords of Acid's poppier later albums is reasonable.If you are into harder techno, you're not going to like this disk. However, the production quality is excellent and there are lots of creative and interesting things going on. This is not music that will ever be played in a club (its too silly and poppy) but if you are in a silly mode its ok."
4,Pure Fun,I've known about The Basement Jaxx for years but never really paid them any mind until I saw them live this past summer at Central Park...I had no idea how much fun they were. The feeling I had at the show came through when I bought the album. Definately an album well worth checking out and if you get the chance go see them live. Cheers!
4,Jaxxin',"This is a very decent followup to Remedy. I think this Cd lacks the spontaneity that Remedy had. Although there is a clear progression in some tracks, on others you can hear the trademark sound that was already showcased on Remedy. I have to admit, i love all the tracks on Rooty...they are so fun to listen to. Romeo is the perfect track to lead off both as their first single and opening track. It sets the tone for the rest of the album. Then you can have tracks like SFM, Jus 1 Kiss and of course the fabulous Where's your head at? Myn only complaint with this album is that it is toooo short. I popped it into my car stereo as soon as i got it..by the time i was home it was alsmot finshed...that kind of disappointed me...i'm so used to buying cds that are 70+ minutes a piece that this kind of set aback. Anyways, great album for all you Jaxx fans and newer fans will appreicate this as well. Just be forworned....It's short"
4,"Eclectic, electric, funk madness.","I have owned this album a few precious hours, but in that short amount of time have realized that Rooty is just as special as Basement Jaxx's previous offering, Remedy. ""Where's your head at"" is my immediate favorite but ""Romeo"" and ""Broken Dreams"" (both of which when juxtaposed with one another evidence the supreme range of Basement's sound) are quickly enticing. If you liked Remedy, you will most certainly like Rooty."
4,the good stuff,"most of this album deserves six out of five stars, but there are places where it slows down, but most of the time you'll be dancing like its the end of the world! Very Fun album!"
5,mmmmmm......Rootylicious,"With a combination from every style of music from hip hop to punk, Basement Jaxx's most recent albumn is an explosion of culture and diversity that puts a smile on that nasty face of yours and makes you want to boogiey. Name based on a bar, Basement Jaxx has a very dynamic sound that is influenced heavily on all parts of the musical spectrum (sorry for you hicks, no country) but still keeps a good beat. All in all, whether your secretely listening in the office or getting your freak on while vacuuming, Basement Jaxx provides an interesting and orginal sound that can satisfy everyone from ravers to gangstars. Keep it real!"
3,pretty decent actually...,"I already had the ""Romeo"" CD single and the ""Tomb Raider"" soundtrack so why did I buy this? Because of the cover mostly. Otherwise, it's some twerpy, cheep-cheep, Prince at Paisley Park watching the cartoon network kinda stuff. Somewhat sexy though, I will allow. My favorite tunes have gotta be 'Breakaway' and 'Get Me Off'. Perfectly harmless fun."
3,a little let down,"After the success of ""Remedy,"" the Basement Jaxx were allowed to let loose in the studio, and produce an all out crazy new sound for house music. The product was somewhat disappointing. After waiting on this album for awhile, as i waited for Daft Punk's, I feel let down by both of them. It seems they got a little to happy in the studio and created a sound that is hard to bob your head to. The album has it's hits, (I'd say about 5) but it also has a lot of rough sounding songs that seem to have no place to go. The Jaxx themselves are genuises, it just depends on the listeners ear, i can't be the judge of this one. The only advice i can give is that if you've never heard ""Remedy,"" I suggest you pick it up before you get this one, its far more enjoyable for the mind and the ear."
4,Great CD,This album is much different from the previous album but in a good way. I find myslef liking it more and more each time I listen to it. M'kay?
2,not what i expected,"Rooty sounds like a Prodigy album gone awry. There's the big beat in-your-face production, but the sounds are all sweet and poppy. There's a few decent cuts like ""Jus 1 kiss"" and ""Get me off"", but most of it is just inane noise. I really hate this type of music."
2,"apart from the few singles, alot of mindless dribble","this album is not much like the previous remedy cd, the singles are ok and show the basement jaxx that everyone knows. Although i found the single ""where's your head at"" kind of annoying the other singles ""romeo"" sounds like vintage bj music same with ""just 1 kiss"",""do your thing"" and ""get me off"" was an ok techno song.The rest of the cd is a bunch of mindess dribble mess that go absolutly nowhere, songs like ""breakaway"",""crazy girl"" and ""SFM"" are good examples and are skipable, unfortunatly i own this cd thinking it would be like ""remedy"" and i never will listen to this cd in its entirety again and i sadly admit this is one of the worst cd's i own but not the worst, that would probably go to daft punk's homework."
2,What The?,"I remember when Basement Jaxx actually sounded serious and not goofy and stupid etcetra...What is this? It's like Disney music or something. Now it sounds like normal pop music with hot heapin' piles of DJ scratches and weird space sounds added into the mix! Don't buy this album, it's not worth your money, and don't listen to the other reviewers."
5,The Future Of Metal!,"Snot is where metal is headed, with such parters as Korn, Coal Chamber, Sevendust, Deftones, and Tura Satana. If you like ANY of these bands, you MUST ""Get Some"" and check out Snot. Look for them on Ozzfest 98 second stage and say ""Hi"" if you see the lads."
5,BUY IT....... NOW!,"I am a fan of metal. Mostly the older metal that could actually hold a beat, but when a new metal band brings out the sound that Snot concocted, that Funk/Metal mixture, who could not love them. The passion in the beats and lyrics, my hat goes off to Snot. Kudos."
4,snot,"this is a good album. Not the greatest ever though. Get some is concistantly heavy all the way through, so if you like lots of heavy guitar riffs filled with scream after scream you would really enjoy this album. There isn't a bad track on the cd. My personal favorites are snot, stoopid, and i jus lie. The rest isn't bad though."
5,SNOT,Snot will always be one of the phattest bands ever. They played with unmatched intensity and an experimental style that blended into a totally unique sound. Lynn will always live on through Snot's music and our memories.
4,Classic album.,I love this cd because it is so raw and in your face. Best song is My Balls Your Chin.
4,Outstanding rock album,"I pretty much bought it for the intro of Snooze Button which is fantastic...but being a long time BR fan I also love the Mr Brett track. Snot rocks, filling a gap for me in time and space somewhere between Korn and Limp Bzkt. Definitely worth a spin!"
5,One of the best,"Who knows how long these guys would have lasted? Certainly not the idiot from Hong Kong. This album was one of the best of the 90's, certainly in the top of it's genre. They were tight, and tweaked their rhythms just enough to make them some of the most driving I've heard. The layers of guitar were raw as well as intricate, and Strait had a dynamic, powerful voice. In other words, they cranked out some of the best heavy shi* out there. Go back to your Cure albums, Hong Kong."
2,Snot - 'Get Some' (Geffen),"Snot has put out,what I assume a title that some patrons might tag as a hardcore CD with 'Get Some'.Upside of this release is that it was produced by none other than T-Ray(Helmet,House Of Pain).Overall,this fifteen track effort is pretty generic.Tunes that were okay include ""Joy Ride"",""Snooze Button"",""Deadfall""(possibly the best song of the entire disc)and ""Mr.Brett"".Simply didn't do much for me."
1,Over-rated,"This has got to be the most over-rated album in history!! It has one maybe two good songs, the rest of it is just bad, everyone seems to think when someone dies that they should praise them as much as possible just because their dead. Well i don't i was expecting so much from this album and got so little, please stay away it's just bad music."
1,Boring,"Lynn Strait was not that amazing. He wrote pretty dull lyrics. I hate how bands are worshipped simply for a dead member(Drowning Pool, Nirvana, etc.)"
1,runny nose,"this band snot is one of the most untalented bands out there. they put matchbox 20 to shame in the untalented band genre. their musical arrangements are poor and unoriginal and they seem to try too hard, if you can believe that. their lackluster effort, get some, is a perfect example of why snot won't last."
5,"Author Photo: Portraits, 1983-2002",Marion Ettlinger is one of the few contemporary artists left in the field of photography. This is a brilliant overview of her work and an exciting insight into the world of some of our great writers.
3,"Kyjen Holiday singing Dog Toy, ""Jingle Bells"" - Red","This is a better toy for a smaller dog. Would be better if animated. For a few more dollars, animation would make a big difference."
3,Great printer but totally unusable and worthless manual feed!,"This printer would rate a 5, but I'm very disappointed with the manual feed. It rarely works, and when it does the print will invariably be rotated off-center. It's very frustrating, especially if you print postage online and are required to file for a refund!!Perhaps I received a faulty unit, but judging from the other reviews on here it appears this is a common problem with these printers. If it were not for the rebate, I would have returned this unit for something else. Cannot recommend."
3,Adequate,"[edit] For those that said this printer jams a lot, they are exaggerating. I've found the best way to avoid this is to always use new paper and keep it full. Or you could do what I do - simply feed one page at a time (through the front slot).I was using an old dot-matrix printer from the 80s (Commodore brand), so for me this was a major upgrade. The print quality is not great sinc it produces light and blurry pages, but it's adequate for my usage (postal labels, mapquest directions, copies). If I need to do something professional like a resume, I simply use my printer at work, or else visit a Kinkos.Anyway I'm satisfied. I paid less than $100 and was able to throw-away the old dot matrix. And in the long term, it will be a LOT cheaper than one of those deskjet models that barely print 100 pages, and then run out of ink. This laser printer can do almost 5000 pages."
2,Uneven toner,"I bought this with an extra toner cartridge a year or two ago. I never really used it (I have another perfectly good laser printer), but my mother has been using it. Recently I switched laser printers with her and I noticed the left side of pages printed with the SCX-4100 fade terribly. I tried a lot of things to fix it - I removed the toner cartridge, shaked it. I used the other toner cartridge, but have the same problem. It's just not worth the hassle and frustration. My Brother HL-2040 prints nice and dark and even (I've been very happy with it), so I think the SCX-4100 will probably go to goodwill.edit: OK, I just realized I bought this over four years ago (wow, time flies), and I bought the HL-2040 less than two years ago... I suppose that could be an excuse for this printer... hmmm It's still a frustrating problem though."
4,economical all in one laser printer,"It's a cheap but useful all in all laser print, and the cartridge can be refilled by ink kit so as to save a lot of money."
1,"Do NOT buy; very bad quality, very expensive toner","Do NOT listen to the others; they are probably Samsung workers planting postive reviews. The truth is, this printer has very terrible print quality, and the worst thing is (which no one else mentions) replacement toner cartridges are very hard to find and extremely expensive. This is a scam since each cartridge prints far fewer sheets than any other laser printers or copiers. Do NOT buy this. Get a better brand like the American HP or Lexmark or Japanese Sharp or Okidata."
4,3200 pages??? no way?,"Today my printer showed ""Low toner"" I printed about 300 pages and is asking me for toner? that should not happened, I think, so today I ordered a $60 toner for my printer before ti runs out of ink, sorry toner.So what is the deal of saying that it will last 3200 pages? don't lie...."
4,the ultimate,the ultimate book of everything you need to know about pathological processes in medicine. way more detail than what is neccesary for any specific class but brings together every discipline to explain disease process.
5,Got to have a book like this.,"FYI, it doesn't say it but this book does have the studentconsult online access code inside the cover."
4,Pathologic Basis of Disease,"This (7th Edition) is a replacement to the Second Edition that I purchased 27 years ago as a requisite text to Human Pathology course in my second year of Optometry school. Similar in size, but with more contemporary concepts, this edition includes many helpful color images and illustrations. Includes up-to-date coverage of many emerging and re-emerging diseases - Lyme, West Nile and MRSA. Includes a CD-ROM that I have yet to explore."
4,totally depends on time....,"This is hands down the best path book, because it has all the diseases in easy to read format with nice tables and pics to complement. However you've got to have time in med school to read it. Depending on your curriculum and how fast you read you may want to compare it to small robins, which has less details and no gross pics.If you have enough time, meaning that you can read a chapter once and also read your notes at the same time without falling behind, then go for it. But if you cannot, then you might need to settle for the ""pocket companion to robins"". Even if you were able to use this book through your course you will definitely not use it(except for its gross pics) for the step 1. FOr that you will be served better with pocket companion. It has the same features as big robins except less details. I used the pocket companion, pics in big robins and goljan audio for the path for the step 1 and i made a 229/95."
2,"Can be used, if you have not other choise","I used this book for my studies in university. If you compare 7. ed with 6. ed, you will find that 6. ed is more convenient and better organized."
4,The standard.,"I don't have much to add that others haven't already mentioned. This book is outstanding, andRobbins and Cotran Review of Pathology, Second Editionis absolutely essential as well. There is room for improvement, though. On many occasions, the clinical presentation of diseases reads more like a list and could really use some explanation as to why these symptoms occur. It makes for less memorizing and more understanding. Also, the authors can be quite verbose on a particular pathogenesis when a simple diagram would be easier to understand and more efficient. Finally, the chapter outline at the beginning of each chapter could use some page numbers that tell you exactly where to find specific information within the chapter. Some of these chapters are nearly 100 pages long with 20 different topics, and I can't understand how none of the editors thought that page numbers in the chapter outline would be a good idea. Other than those minor complaints, this book is absolutely top notch."
4,"The bible, but use it like Harrison's","Don't try to read this monster unless your going into Pathology. It's very well written, but you just don't have time to cover this many details. You need to focus more on the Boards relevant material which is covered in books MUCH smaller (Rapid Review or BRS Path).That said, this book has outstanding pictures, tables and diagrams. Moreover, even with the Internet and Wikipedia, this is an indespensible reference tool to look up areas that you've forgotten or aren't clear on and do reports on case studies. I purchased this book and Harrison's knowing full well that I wouldn't getting money out of them until Residency."
4,big book of pathology,This is more of a reference text with highly detailed information. It is well written and very thorough. I recommend getting the companion questions to help bring out key concepts.
3,Shipping??,I was amazed that a company that did so much shipping did not take the effort to wrap to protect something so delicate as ceramic filter candles. I would have thought that it would have been obvious to the simplest of shippers that it needed proper padding.Also when I returned the 3 (three) items that 3 (three) items would have been shipped back to me as replacements and not just one. It does not give me a lot of confidence to do business with you as a company.
4,Would have liked more scenes from the old programs,"This DVD has some great wildlife scenes from Nature's 25 years. I especially liked the one in which the two elephants, Shirley and Jenny, recognize each other as friends after 25 years-- a heartwarming moment like no other in the series. But most of the scenes are from the past few years of the show. The only clip from an episode with narration by George Page was from ""Kingdom of the Ice Bear"". Page had created the series, hosted and narrated it for many years. There was a tribute to his work by Lynne Sherr, who hosts the special. But it was a somewhat of a disappointment that scenes from more of the old episodes were not included, which, I think were ""The Best of Nature"". A few of the old programs are available on DVD here at Amazon, and they are well worth getting if you are a fan of the show. But most of them, which were once available on VHS, have not been transferred to DVD."
3,Letterbox? Squished!,"The content is five stars, but the presentation is a 1. The original broadcast was in letterbox HD format, with a 16x9 aspect ratio. Granted this is not an HD DVD, but for some reason, the picture has been squished into a 4x3 (1.33:1) format. No amount of DVD player tweaking changes this, this despite the claim on the box that the video is ""letterbox""'ed. Now, the cover on my box is different from that shown here, so I'm wondering if I got a defective early batch. PBS is sending me a replacement, so stay tuned!"
2,Talk about compression...,"I have NOT seen this DVD, so how can I rate it?Easily. For anyone to take 25 years of the ""Best of Nature"" and CRAM it into 86 MEASLY minutes means that this is an attempt to make some easy money. It is not quality, for quality requires more than a brief montage averaging less than 3 and 1/2 minutes per year - do the math! I have seen numerous shows in the past and loved them. This is a travesty and a poor joke. It is worse than fast food."
4,fab.,"Very fast delivery. The DVD is in great condition.I would definitely purchase from this seller, again."
4,A great 2nd or 3rd knife,"I like this knife, I really do. However, for it to be truly functional as a santoku knife, it has to have a scalloped edge so that your food doesn't stick to the blade. The handle also is really light and doesn't have the same heft or balance as, say, the Henckels 5 star series would have. The small grip is somewhat uncomfortable for people with larger hands and it doesn't have any texture so it is difficult to use if hands are a bit wet. This is the first knife I grab for slicing up meat and the fact that it keeps a razor sharp edge is nice. However, if you were to own one knife in your kitchen, I would not recommend this."
4,good all purpose kitchen knife,"This knife is great, it's light weight, sharp, and it has all the good things you expect from a Henckels knife. It's also affordable for household kitchens.it's easier to handle than a cleaver, which was what i used before this (I am from a Chinese family, we use cleavers for everything), but I do have one gripe, the blade is not big like a cleaver, so when i am slicing carrots into thin strings, sometimes my knuckles run into the cutting board. it will take some getting used to."
3,Look Closely At The Blade,"Since all the santoku knives I've seen lately have the scalloped recessions, which helps keep food from sticking to the blade, I automatically assumed this one had them. But you REALLY need to look at the larger photo. You'll find that this knife lacks them. I only looked at the thumbnail and feel more the fool now.I gave it a three because it feels good in my hand and was nice and sharp out of the box. But food definitely sticks to its sides.Now I don't know that the scalloped recessions actually work as well as many claim, but I'd have liked to find out. I still have to hold certain foods to make sure they stay on the chopping board and don't come up/back with the knife. If they do work, I'd have really liked to have them.It's a nice knife overall, but caveat emptor. Look closely at the photos to make sure you're getting what you expect."
4,Ouch.. I just cut myself..,".. on this super sharp knife! It's a great knife with good balance. Not sure if I'd prefer one of those scalloped blades, as food does stick to the sides a lot."
4,Must Read,"Taste of Salt, by Frances Temple is the best book I have read yet. This book teaches you how life is special. The book has emotion, love, happiness, loneliness, and a lot more real feelings people have. The best part is the writer is very graphic in her writing, you almost feel like you were there. The whole book is interesting, you never get tired of reading it. I think Taste of Salt can touch many people in different ways."
4,Another great read,"John Walsh is great at fighting crime and has found a new voice in writing about the criminals he helps take off the streets. Pulblic Enemies grabs you at the begining and holds on tight. Every story is chilling and you are glad that John Walsh is out there watching over us like a big brother. The story of the Yosemite murders was particularly chilling. It thoroughly explains how the women where in a very dark and secluded section of the Motel. It actually gave me the creeps. Mr. Walsh does not exploit the victims or their families, he just tells the story like it is and leaves the reader with a real empathy for the people involved."
3,In-depth reporting of news items,"I bought this book while on vacation. I don't watch John Walsh's TV show, America's Most Wanted; in fact, I probably haven't ever seen an entire episode all the way through. I had heard something about all the criminals discussed. The big appeal of this book is the beginning-to-end coverage of crimes that I knew previously only through a series of sound bites. Like Time Magazine, it expresses opinions rather than remaining neutral on its subjects, and, like Time, mixes together subjective and objective statements to create a blend this is most informative. The biggest surprise, and a plus for the book, is the insights John Walsh gives of us of how both he and other relatives of crime victims react to the crimes, both immediately and in the long term."
2,I have two of his three books and.....,".............I think he does a wonderful job at putting these works together. The only bone I have a the moment is that Mr. Walsh tends to make all his victims heroes/saints/outstanding figures of society. That cannot be true. All victims are not saint-like. Conversely, the bad guys have no worthy trauma in their background. Cut and dried, bad is bad, no slack from Mr. Walsh. I'm still thinking about that theory."
3,Australian SF Reader,"Fairly average, I don't enjoy this nearly as much as the Evergence trilogy. I wonder if there is any chance these guys ever do a stand-alone book?More of your people separated from bodies type fare.The middle volume of a trilogy, as events shape up and the alien forces come into play."
1,"Editor, please",This book goes on and on and on. Where was an editor? Was the author just trying to fill pages ... descriptions about indecision over ordering dinner choices leave the reader thinking just that. This is my first ... and last ... book by this author.
3,Audio Book,"I thought I had ordered the book, but since the audio arrived, I gave it to a senior citizens home so they could enjoy it. The home says several people have now listened to it, and I found a neat gift to send to these types of facilities."
1,Unfit for reading,"Slow moving story ... boring read. Total waste of time. Half-way through the book, I dread myself to finish it. The character in the story (Nina) has not been developed convincingly. Help, anyone wants to buy my copy?"
3,Woefully short on credibility but with redeeming qualities,"In short, ths is recommended mainly for those who are Nina Reilly fans. Those who aren't should first read earlier books in the series. This is a weak entry and the O'Shaughnessy sisters don't deserve to be judged by this one. However, Nina herself shines as we get very deep into her feelings and can appreciate her reaction to having all she's been striving for threatened. There are also fascinating glimpses into graphology and into Chinese immigrant culture. There are too many plots juggled here and the ending...well, the less`said, the better.Bottom line, faults and virtues sort of balance each other out and fans will want to read it even if they are disappointed with some aspects of the book."
1,Definitely Unft,"There sure seems to be no shortage of loyal fans of this series, but after my first Nina Reilly read, I am at a loss as to why. 454 pages in paperback might have benefited greatly from being about half that. I don't think writers are paid by the word, but when you read sentences like ""Nina went with the evocatively named lemongrass-skewered sea scallops"" you can only shake your head.Or how about the denouement ... where her lover is about to topple over a railing ..., looks at Nina, smiles (SMILES? As you're nearly falling to your death?) and says ""love you?"" Really bad stuff.The trial (during which I was rooting mightily for disbarment) scenes are void of tension or interest. Like another reader, I skimmed quite a bit just to get through it - I did shell out [money] after all. It became almost a perverse challenge to finish this. God bless the O'Shaughnessy sisters for getting away with this kind of writing, but they won't [draw] me in again."
4,Pretty Good Legal Thriller,"I don't usually read legal thrillers but I got this one for free from a book club years ago and read it and was glad I did. It was a decent story.When lawyer Nina Reilly's personal files are stolen, her clients start to die. She has to turn to her ex husband for help as well as her boyfriend and things go from bad to worse. Most of the events take place in and around Lake Tahoe and the set pieces are quite nice.I really enjoyed the story. It is told in solid third person with crisp narrative and lean exposition. It was a pleasure to read with a satisfying conclusion. A great read. Since I'm no lawyer, I can't speak for the accuracy of the legal parts of the story but I enjoyed it. Recommended."
1,Disappointing,"I usually relish the chance to read a new Perri O'Shaughnessy.I thought the main plot line was somewhat unbelievable. If Nina is such a hot shot lawyer, and of course we know she is from the previous books, she would not leave her briefcase containing suchimportant files, in her car overnight.The female police officer and the female prosecuting attorney are just totally unbelievable in their language and approach to Nina. Very stereotypical, we don't like beautiful smart women.<P..."
3,A Lawyer's Nightmare,"For the legal thriller addict, Unfit To Practice is an interesting fix. The O'Shaughnessy sisters pen a tale that is entertainingly suspenseful. Nina Reilly, a small town lawyer has her vehicle stolen and with it the files of three of her clients. The sensitive files apparently fall into the wrong hands. The book details the subsequent fallout.I found Ms. Reilly's ethical dilemmas realistic. This was the first O'Shaughnessy novel I have read, so I am unable to compare it with previous Reilly reads. Although the story is a bit too touchy-feely for my general liking - one reviewer described the book as a ""chick-flip"" - and certainly not the best legal thriller I have read, I was entertained and plan on reading another Reilly novel."
3,First half good`,"I have read other books by these authors and liked them. This book started out ok but went downhill. The trial was very, very boring and just the first half of the story over again. The ending was just ridiculous. Sometimes when authors are doing a series the books go downhill - maybe they are on deadline. I will stop and think before I buy another book by them."
3,This video will put you to sleep,"I am quite excited about the Pilates method of training and have tried a variety of videos by different instructors. Body Control gave a very precise description of the proper alignment and torso control methods. However, it was so slow and boring that after watching the first segment I had to take a nap!. I did continue to watch the rest of the video which had hardly any of the classic Pilates poses demonstrated. I doubt that anyone seeing this video as an introduction to Pilates would continue to explore it further."
3,Pilates is great!,"This is a good video if you have a lot of time. Pilates is great for toning and stretching the body. I enjoy working with this tape when I have 90 minutes to spare to do the entire tape. The pace is slow and relaxing, allowing time for the viewer to use the proper form. The results are good also, after a few times you can feel your muscles lengthening, and you are able to go a little farther each time you do it!"
2,Too confusing for the rank beginner,"I didn't get very far with this. Ms. Robinson begins with an inspiring talk about what pilates can do for you and then lies prone on a mat talking about what she's doing with her muscles. I couldn't follow the explanation. I admit that my abs are ridiculously weak and I am not knisthetically gifted. Those with some previous exposure to pilates may benefit from this video, but it's really confusing for an out-of-shape beginner."
3,"This is probably better than I've rated it, BUT...","I think I needed to start with something a bit easier as my ""core"" has been asleep for many years. I am borrowing my in-laws copy of Stephanie Power's Silver Foxes Pilates tape, which I understand is great for those who need to start at a lower level of Pilates movements. I liked what I saw, I just couldn't do the movements. Ms. Robinson's books are GREAT for explaining the theory and background of Pilates, though."
5,Great book for intermediate to advanced fly fishers,"This is a great reading for those of you who love to fish small streams, through the reading I realize that this is the second book by the author to complement one on tying small flies. You can read this one by its own.I'm a fly fishing enthusiast who love to fish small streams whit ultra light tackle and his recommendations on tackle doesn't suit what I use, instead you have to focus on the strategies and tactics presented here with an open mind to it.I've read a lot of books on fly fishing and I was in love on his style of writing and the way it present it to the reader. I don't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone, but if you are an intermediate or advances fly fisher give this book a try."
3,Austin Miles has changed his views,"As a friend of the author Austin Miles, and having read the book, I have no doubt over the matters he witnessed firsthand. Although I'm an Assemblies of God minister, I recognize that in all human organizations (churches are human organizations) there will be fallible people with poor judgment and liable to temptation. Austin Miles has come back to Christianity, and has repudiated the negative attitude he expresses in his book towards Christianity, although he still maintains what he saw was true. He and I have had many wonderful conversations, and will continue to do so. He is a preacher again, and travels to churches. He has returned to Christian ministry with lessons learned and a new attitude. Rev. Richard F. Lee"
5,Preaching to the Choir,"This book, intended primarily as an internal Microsoft morale booster, is an excellent read.However, one must not forget that this book is intended to perpetuate the cult of Microsoft among its employees, and as such, contains inherent bias and self-flattery. Think of it as an exceptionally well-done recruiting brochure."
5,A fascinating look inside Microsoft,"This book gives an unprecedented look inside the minds and lives that make up Microsoft. It's filled with little essays from each of hundreds upon hundreds of employees, organized topically -- a set of short essays about testing, about the difficulties of device driver support, about the concept of the social interface (think Bob), about the work environment... It paints a vivid picture of life inside of the most successful software company in the world, straight from its employees.(It's also a handsome coffee table book, with vivid photography of the employees at work and at play to complement the text.)"
2,Shipping rates,I paid about $16.50 for the flags (3 of them) and 25.99 for shipping--isn't this TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much for shipping?
2,"Fairly low quality, colors bleed","Got this flag for a shadow box, military style for an employee of my organization who had completed 2 tours in Iraq and 1 tour in Afghanistan. I was disappointed at the quality, not at all what I expected."
5,Absolutely amazing and top notch quality recording.,"This is NOT a budget recording. This is one of the top few cassical CDs I enjoy listening to of many. The recording quality is outstanding (honest, it is amazing audiophile quality) and the performance is breathtaking. I don't write many reviews but felt I should share the joy of this CD by writing a review. I had my attention brought to it by an audiphile listing that recomended it, and they were correct."
3,"Good information, however, detail could be improved.","This book is intended to help counselors pass their NBCC and licensing exams. Information for the aforementioned exams is good, nevertheless, as a graduate instructor I don't believe it tells you nearly enough to pass your exam unless you really know it. It might for the CRC, that's a bit out of my expertise.We recommend the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COUNSELING, MASTER REVIEW AND TUTORIAL to our students by Dr. Howard Rosenthal, which is also stocked by Amazon Com. At the very least, if you decide to buy this book for NBCC/Licensing then supplement it with the ENCYCLOPEDIA.All in all, the book is well-written and easy to follow and does contain good accurate information."
5,A Book to Keep,"The poses and models are outstanding. Close examination -- by putting your nose next to the image -- not necessarily a practictical view -- does show in many instances a graininess or pixellation ===>> This does NOT detract from the value of the image. [ Original prints would be a delight to have. ]This book is an example of fine example of showing male good looks and is somewhat ""conservative"" in that it does only show nudity from the back.This great photographer is well worth while to add to your collection."
5,Seeing the Real South Beach,"I visited South Beach recently and was at a loss of what to bring back as gifts for special friends. ""South Beach Deco, Step by Step"" was perfect. I got one for myself so I didn't have to take a lot of photos because this book has a great variety of pictures, many of the Art Deco Hotels which were a highlight of my trip. Aside from the great visuals, the text gave me all I needed to know to have a great time; it was like a companion who filled me in on everything - - the best things to see, the coolest places to eat and where to just relax and enjoy the scene. The book made me comfortable that I wasn't missing out on something (""what you didn't see...""). There are also some fun maps that are easy to read. All in all, an A+ and something I pick up and look at because its interesting and beautiful, and reminds me I want to go back to SouthBeach."
1,Not worth the money!,"My 1st grade daughter watched the horrible videos for about 5 minutes before becoming bored and wanting to do something, anything, else. The videos are like something I would have seen in the 70's. Definitely not up to the kids of todays standards.I would not recommend this program."
2,Not very good,"My son 8 who seems to enjoy stuff on the computer then in the class room, was not impressed with this c.d.'s at all. He was bored and it just was not keeping his interested at all. I watched him while he was getting started and I have to agree.Sorry...not our favorite pick."
4,Inspirational Reading,"When one sees a positive communicator like Dr. Robert H. Schuller, it is easy to assume they are so upbeat because they've had an easy life. This insider's account of Dr. Schuller's life makes it plain that that has not been the case and upon further reflection, one realizes everybody faces their own set of challenges in life. In fact, a person becomes a positive influence for good by overcoming challenges. Dr. Schuller's son in law authored this book so he knows his subject matter first hand.I have been an admirer of Dr. Schuller for a long time. His insightful wisdom has helped me in numerous ways to experience a better life than I would otherwise. Reading this book helps you to see the connection that one person's overcoming has a ripple effect on many other lives. Dr. Schuller's victories were victories for those of us who have learned from him. He has been used of God to motivate, inspire, and bless. I pray that I will be such a vessel too."
1,Breaks easily,"This is the only rewinder found at my local Best Buy, so I bought it. It seems that when the video finally gets to the start, it ought to pop up but sometimes does not. When that happens, it apparently fries some delicate part in the rewinder and then it doesn't work again. There's no predicting when yours will act like this, but my experience is that it can happen in the first dozen times you use it."
5,Simply the best I have read,"As a faculty trainer and instructional designer, I have had the opportunity to read many volumes dealing with the instructional design process and Web-based courses. This volumn is simply the best I have read. There is not a single chapter that I did not get domething from. I will begin teaching a certificate program in Web-based course design and implementation in the Spring and this book will the text for the first course.I have had the opportunity to critique several hundred Web-based courses over the last three years. The vast majority are flawed from an instructional desing standpoint. This book should be required reading for all persons designing Web-based courses as, if followed, the percentage of courses that are designed and implemented correctly would increase dramatically.I cannot recommend this volume too highly. In addition to being well written, the references (many on the Web) are great.Jim"
3,"Mostly for academia, very uneven","Ostensibly, this book covers the subject of creating web-based educational courseware thoroughly; however, it is mostly geared towards university distance learning (including hypbrid uses), which I found of limited use to those in military or corporate training development. The basis of the information, where each chapter is written by a different author, ranges from tenets based on primary research, to those based on extrapolation from text and CBI research, to ""common practice"" and personal experience (but written as though the truth). Very little information is based on primary research for web-based instructional design (including interface issues), although each chapter has a long bibiography. Also, this is one of the worst-edited books I've read in a long time, though the first chapter is the killer. If you're new to the subject of distance learning and you're in K-12 or higher education, it may be useful to you. Else...is there ""else""? I'm still searching."
2,Poorly made,"not very well built. parts alway fall off. lightsabers break with slightest use, limbs to not move very well. arms break and fall off. these can not be played with with out falling to apart. lack of arm and leg movement options make very limmeted play.son played with for a week and put away."
3,not a good fit,"didn't fit well or attach well to my minivan seat and then ripped 3 months later, was used to hold tissues and small toys"
2,No tie down cords,"Even though it says on the box the tie down cords are included, according to customer service, they aren't. In other words, they sell a product that is meant to attach to your seat, but they don't include a way for you to do that. Customer service was quite slow. I had to send several emails before I got a response, which was simply ""sorry for the inconvenience"". Not exactly helpful. Save yourself the hassle and buy a similar product at an auto store where you can return it more easily in case there is a problem."
1,Would not recommend,"The first day we had them one fell apart..... Then they don't easily tie to the bottom of the seat so they hang , someone could trip over them for how they hang. Waste of money!"
2,a little flimsy,The backseat organizer is flimsier than I had hoped. Other reviewers wrote that it sort of flopped around. That's true. I realized that a shopping bag hooked over the back seat would do just a well. (:
1,Missing tie-down cords to secure to seat.,It looks fine. A little smaller than I expected. It was missing the tie-down cords to secure to the bottom of the seat that it claims were included.
1,Not good,This organizer started ripping on us almost immediately. I didn't cram alot of stuff in either- just a few books. It was completely worthless.
1,never worked as described,this product never worked it was blank im not happy at all it said inspected but it wasent it stank
4,"Love magnalite for stews, chili etc","Have had magnalite for about 20 years. I also own all types of All Clad stainless. For some reason, when it comes to cooking big pots of stews, chicken and dumplings, and chili, I always get out the 14 quart magnalite. I hope they have not changed the quality as the over review states. The roaster is also fantastic. I could never fry eggs or chicken in the fry pans however, they seem to want to stick. I always had very good luck with receipes that have a good amount of liquid called for and will always use them for fudge because the bottom is heavy, and roasters because the roast comes out super. I have to have my magnalite lined up by my all clad!!!!"
3,Poor Packaging,"The Hepa Filter arrived damaged because of poor packing. The filter is loose and a hole was punctured in it. Contacted Shop Fox who promptly sent me another filter, that arrived crushed and unusable. Again a victim of poor packaging."
3,Fake Is Correct!,"It has some trade secrets within its covers. It is worth reading. But outrageous price for paperback. Story is OK but incomplete. Keep your money, Study your artist, buy some paints and brushes and Google ""Art Forgery Techniques"". You'll learn more."
5,Earliest Days In Paris As A Talented Pupil Of Leger To His Final Escapades On The Spanish Island Of Ibiza,"""This is the astonishing and often incredible-but-true story of Elmyr de Hory---the world's greatest art forger, who painted over a thousand brilliant fake canvasses reputedly worth more than sixty million dollars in today's art market.No twentieth-century master's technique was too difficult for Elmyr, who could turn out a Picasso or a Renoir at a moment's notice in a hotel room---not to mention Modiglianis, Matisses, Vlamincks, Derains, and Dufys that were sold to leading art galleries and museums around the world.Author Clifford Irving brilliantly relates the exotic, flamboyant life of this Hungarian refugee, from hisEARLIEST DAYS IN PARIS AS A TALENTED PUPIL OF LEGER TO HIS FINAL ESCAPADES ON THE SPANISH ISLAND OF IBIZA.....""[from the book of the cut-off piece paper (look like front or back flap) on first title page.]"
4,Talented man,Enjoyable story ... made me research on youtube for some photos and more information on Elmyr De Hory and the artists he forged.
4,Works well for home tapper,"I used this product for refilling a Miller Lite home keg for home brewing purposes. Worked great except the neck of the CO2 cartridges were too narrow. This was easily fixed by wrapping them with Teflon tape. My only complaint was that mine arrived in a plastic zip lock type bag and not in a cardboard box as pictured. Not a big deal, but I wanted to read the product information on the box!"
4,Just as advertised,A box of CO2 cartridges for a decent price. I use them to inflate bike tires if I get a flat while riding. So far I've only had one flat (they'll start coming in the fall) but it worked well then.
3,non-returnable,"i'm sure this is perfectly nice CO2, but I mistakenly ordered the non-threaded (they seriously need to take the word ""threaded"" out of the description). because it is a gas product, Amazon refuses returns, so now i have $15 of garbage."
3,Defeat into Victory,"A comprehensive story of a less well known battlefield of World War II. Some confusion over the repetition of numerical regiments, but all-in-all good reading."
4,end of empire odyssey illuminating period attitudes,"Slim takes us in defeat back to the borders of India where the imperial armies are retrained and re-equipped. This force then uses the Japanese strengths against them - their all or nothing attacks, and indifference to the suffering of their own men. A fin-de-siecle spectacle of Empire."
5,Suberbly Written,This is about as well written a book as I have ever read : a model of clarity and economy .That Slim was an equally suberb leader of men is a double helping of good stuff . Should be taught as a model of leadership as Slim praises his people for their successes and takes the blame for failure on himself .
4,Saint Etienne - He's On The Phone,"The EP side of HE'S ON THE PHONE sees Saint Etienne in a much more mellow mood, especially with the sweet and slightly sad ""Groveley Road,"" a track that smacks of the heyday of 60s pop. ""Is It True"" seems much more simplistic, less of a complete song than an outline, but ""The Process"" goes back to the fullness and richness that we've come to love."
4,"Uncharacteristic For Hiatt, But A Fine Album Nonetheless","I've read the other 4 reviews of ""All Of A Sudden"", and strangely enough I agree with them all, at least insofar as the text of the reviews is concerned, if not the star ratings. It's true that this album is heavily produced, all the more striking in light of how spare many Hiatt albums are. Hiatt is a quintessential singer/songwriter, but when this album came out he was definately coming from a different place. The uptempo new wave keyboard-heavy sound seems a bit dated now but it was great fun at the time. ""My Edge of the Razor"" still ranks as one of his finest songs. Fans of the more rockin' albums ""Slugline"" and ""Two Bit Monsters"" will probably enjoy this. Fans of the later, more laid-back folkish albums may want to pass this one by. But if your musical tastes include room for both styles, don't let the poor reviews deter you, this is indeed a fine album."
2,John's leap into techno-pop suffers from slick production,"John's 1st effort for the then-new Geffen label suffers from slick production at the hands of Tony Visconti. ""I Look For Love"" is awash in techno-pop synthesizers, while the rockabilly "" Doll Hospital"" is crushed by an avalanche of keyboard hell. Maybe this is why ALL OF A SUDDEN was the last LP in his extensive discography to be released on CD. The gem on this album is ""My Edge Of The Razor"" , which features John's signature voice in stunning form. A sample of greater things to come, and worth the price of the entire album."
2,An album for Hiatt completists,"This is the one that nearly got away. One can't help feeling that there are some good songs here; they're just hidden by the production which comes over brash and overdone. The album seems to rush itself somehow with only My Edge of the Razor as a change of pace. Still, it has a certain charm but is probably for serious Hiatt fans only."
2,"Not really a ""book""",This isn't an informative book. It's a glorified journal with a couple pages of text in it. This is NOT what I was hoping for to help guide us through having a child in the NICU for 6-8 weeks. Waste of money. I have a journal already and don't use it!
3,Buffalo Bill sleep pants,Love the pants but feel that the pants should almost be a solid color so the Bills emblem shows up more.
1,Too Expensive,The case itself was $10. Add shipping and it was $17. It doesn't have a strap you can wrap around your wrist. Could have found one at a department store for less money and more product.
5,Maybe the best deal in Classical music!,"Up until I bought this CD I barley knew who Ivry Gitlis was. I bought it because it was such a great deal and had pieces included that I liked very much all in one package. My plan was to leave it in my car and put my favorites back in the house where they couldn't get damaged. Man, was I surprised byt the quality of these performances and the recording in general. Mr. Gitlis is about as good as you can get and all the performnces are of a very high quality. Much better than I expected. Even the sound is pretty good. I just wish I had more CD's that I was this happy with."
4,I give 5 stars to his technique !,"These performances were recorded between 1954-1957 ;therefore the tone of an orchestra is slightly unclear. But, I'm scarcely bothered by it. The sounds of Gitlis's string are fully clear. You must be enjoy his virtuosity in every part of these disks. Furthemore, What a price for 2 CD !! You should get it."
5,A great book on bears and zoology in Southeast Asia,"I would say half of this book is on bears, half on journeys throughout Southeast Asia. This suited me find since I love both topics. Montgomery deals with both well, and explains both the wildlife trade and scientific concepts in clear language. I also like how she does not reveal the conclusion of the search until the end, allowing for a suspensful read. I have to admit, I have read many books about environmental issues in Southeast Asia, but was surprised by a lot in this book (including the extent of keeping bears in hotels in Phnom Penh). A great story of discovery in Southeast Asia."
1,"Terrible product, even worse customer service","This DVD player is a complete piece of junk. If I could give it a zero or negative star rating, I would. I concur with all of the other similar reviews. And when I called their customer service center about exchanging it for another product, they first lost my request and then when I called back they were rude and incompetent. This is the last Philips product I will ever buy."
1,Yuk!,"I've read a number of reviews where they discussed the time between issuing a command and having it executed/completed and how that can be a ""bit"" or ""somewhat"" annoying. If you're trying to save money you may think that such a flaw is ok. Well, IT IS NOT. It is painful. I have 3 kids jumping around, and, from time to time, it is used to pacify or reward them. Such a wait complicates that process. (The preceding example is not intended to make this a ""Daddy"" review) Stay away from any DVD player where a reviewer mentions the slow response time. It's not worth it. Go get a second job if you have to but spend a couple hundred more."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!!!!,This was my first stand-alone DVD player and what a disappointment is has been. A horrendous amount of skipping occurs until the DVD stops playing altogether. Probably put together by slave laborers working for a few pennies a day in Red China and it certainly shows it.
1,Terrible player!!!!,"Like many reviewers I've had the same problems. Skipping, stuttering, freezing, all-out refusal to play and restarting. can't get past the FBI warning on Disney DVDs. This is the second unit I have purchased in the last month. The first I returned to the store thinking I had one defective one. The second one does the same thing. FRUSTRATING!!!! Had a JVC player for two years that was fantastic till the laser burnt out."
1,I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PHILLIPS PRODUCT-0 stars,"We purchased a 5-Disc changer from Media Play-Phillips Brand. We did not pay the extra $ for the extended warranty and I'm glad because we would have only wasted more than the [money] already paid. I have never watched a DVD without having to spend 10 minutes trying to get it to work again. Now I can't even play CD's without opening and closing the tray at least 15 times-When it does finally load-It needs to load again and again... Please, take my advice and buy ANY OTHER brand. What a headache and [money]dollars down the drain."
1,BUYER BEWARE : A CLASSIC LEMON,SAME AS BELOW. FREEZES UNPREDICTABLY. STOPS ALTOGETHER. I HAVE A THEORY THAT ITS A BALANCE PROBLEM BETWEEN THE TRAY AND SPINDLE WHICH PHILIPS WON'T OWN UP TO--UNLESS THE REVIEWS KEEP COMING. I'M GOING TO WRITE A LETTER TO PHILIPS--WISH ME LUCK.
1,Junk,"I have to agree with everyone here. Skipping, freezing, slow loading, and no load-up at all. We purchased our Philips DVD player as part of the home theater package. We love the receiver portion of the theater package but hate the DVD player. I think Best Buy wishes I didn't purchase the 4 year extended warranty package because it is going back for the second time in five months and I have every intention of taking it back every time until they know me by name. My procrastination and the long lines at Best Buy have stopped me from taking it in months ago. If you own one of these, don't think that it is the DVD disk that is bad because every time I thought it may have been a bad rental, we ended up plugging in our portable DVD player and finished watching the movie, with no troubles. So, if you are looking at buying a DVD player, take the advise from many others and look somewhere else."
1,Beware of this 5-disc DVD changer - Zero Stars Rating,"Unfortunately, this is an example of deceptive advertising on the part of Philips.It is billed as a 5-disc DVD changer. However, it is a ***manual*** changer. You have to physically press a button on the unit itself or the remote control to get the unit to play the next disc in the sequence. It will not automatically go to the next disc.Further, the unit's internal programming is poorly done. It can take over 60 seconds for the unit to respond to a command, such as: open the disc drawer to insert/remove a CD or DVD, or to simply load a CD or DVD to play.This is a very poorly designed unit, with very poor performance in terms of its user interface. I certainly would not recommend this unit to anyone wishing to purchase a multi-disc DVD/CD changer, regardless of the price offered."
1,Take a pass,"I have had an identical experience to Doug Ratcliff who also reviewed this product. Incredibly slow response to commands not to mention the skipping, resetting, and locking up altogether. I wish I had read his review before I bought my unit. Since I'm 11 days past the 90 days, it's going to cost about 1/2 what I paid for the unit (plus shipping) to get another one which is guaranteed not to be a NEW unit, just one that has been ""remanufacutured"" which I think means ""repaired."" Maybe I'll get one of Doug's returned units that has been repaired."
1,Pure junk,"I thought a manufacturer like Philips would be roughly equivalent to other major brands. The 782C is pure junk. I couldn't play 75% of DVDs I tried. Commands took a looong time to execute. And when you entered another command while it is thinking about the current command, it could lock up. The CD mode played all the CDs I tried, but compared to my CD-only Sony changer, it was like going back to the early 80's in technology.On the otherhand, my JVC DVD worked excellently and played all the DVDs I couldn't watch on the Philips 782C."
1,JUNK,"I bought one of these for Christmas, after a week it started skipping. fortunately Amazon extended their return policy and I returned it. Unfortunately, I bought another.... AND IT""S DOING THE SAME @*"
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of my favorite Rugrats of all time.Vacation is my favorite because of love Las Vegas.The stories are cool and the comedy is great too!Chuckie vs.The Potty.Chuckie's being potty trained and Angelica taunts him!Doctor Susie.Susie learns to be a toy""doctor""and fixes the babies' toys.But Angelica breaks them again and blames it on Susie.Vacation Special.The Rugrats are on vacation in Las Vegas and searching for the ""kitties""(tigers)in a live animal act.The best one in the video.FinsterellaAs Kira studies her part in Cinderella,Angelica tells Chuckie Kira's really talking about how it's going to be a home.Bigger Than Life.Kimi can turn anything into an adventure and Chuckie's jealous.My least favorite.This video is worth the money,trust me!"
2,The playing drags,"Although Bronislaw Gimple played these pieces with beautiful clarity of tone, his playing lacked spark and often dragged. His pace and rhythm were far too slow and dull to capture the most out of these pieces. If you want to hear a richer and far better treatment of the Goldmark concerto (a very underrated work in my opinion and one that certainly deserves wider exposure), as well as livelier interpretations of Kreisler, I recommend Itzhak Perlman's recordings of these pieces. They are well paced and snappy without being played too fast and truly bring out the best in Kreisler and Goldmark."
5,The finest book of its kind,"As an English instructor, I've found this book to be the most help for students whose previous experience in writing focused on larger more content based matters such as thesis statements, topic and support sentences, etc. , rather than on the sentence-level matters of styles. Many of my college students have an adequate knowledge of how to write an argument, but no idea of how to vary their sentences and link one sentence to the next. This book is a great help and the only one I've found that deals with matters like specificity, conciseness, precision, subordination, coordination, tone, and voice in the detail such matters demand. I highly recommend it."
3,Ambitious,"The first time I heard this album, I was amazed at how confident Michell sounded in negotiating this unfamiliar territory of synthesizers and drum machines. She writes songs that actually use the technology to their advantage. The catchy pop of ""Good Friends,"" for example, just wouldn't sound right played on acoustic guitar and bongos. There are some problems. The overly repetitive ""The Three Great Stimulants"" and ""Ethiopia"" are sheer torture. The lyrics are often preachy - worst offender: ""Tax Free,"" which happens to be an attack on televangelists. The music can be spine-tingling even when the lyrics are below her standard, as in ""Impossible Dreamer,"" with its unexpected chord changes and haunting sax fills by Wayne Shorter. This album is essential for a full understanding Joni Mitchell as an artist. When it works, it shows just how far she can stretch."
1,"Please Joni, return to your accoustic folk sound","Don't get me wrong, I love Joni Mitchell. Her sound has influenced modern rock but this is not a good album and will not stand the test of time. The over-effected instrumentation does not allow the true beauty of Joni's voice to shine through; all raw emtion is lost in the distracting ""electronics."" There is no personal-confessional feel to this album. I've only listened to it once."
5,her most misunderstood chapter.,"you must admire joni for always being honest, & you can't say she doesn't take risks, because this album is a perfect example of not trying to please people & doing/saying what you believe fearlessly. i agree with joni's political views, so i was able to enjoy this album on that level as well. this is NOT the joni of ""blue"" or even ""court & spark"" & a lot of fans have a hard time with that. but if you give it a real chance, it will definatly grow on you."
2,Beware of Dog,"I'm a huge Joni fan. I have every one of her albums. I would put this one near the bottom of the list. The production is plastic, gimmicky. Electronic drum sounds, synthetic sounding reverb...a desperate attempt to be contemporary. Thomas Dolby as a producer was a bad idea. He blinded me with circuit boards. The vocals aren't that great, or mixed well in relation to the music. Smoking damage beginning to show. The songs are wordy, awkward and unmusical. It simply isn't enjoyable in any way. Like a spoonful of castor oil. I appreciate the message Joni was attempting to convey, but she was out of her element, and it showed, bigtime. I like the cover, though."
5,On Fire,"I think this is one of Joni's best albums. Great lyrics, catchy phrases, biting social and political commentary and finger pointing at her finest. Plus good music! I applaud her!"
1,Deceptive advertising,"This modem will not work in my PC. The requirements from CNET, listed below, were not made clear up front. I have a slower Pentium without MMX capability (required for this modem to work). Had these requirements been made clear in the initial listing, I'd have looked elsewhere. Many people still run old hardware. These requirements should have been included in the ad....Minimum PC Requirement - IBM Compatible PC equipped with Pentium 233MHZ or higher- PCI bus expansion slot- Microsoft Windows 95/98, ME, NT, 2000, XP- No Support for DOS or Win 3.1"
4,worked great,I was worried about buying ink online but this colored ink worked great. The only issue I had was the black ink it was bundled with did not work at all. I suspect because it was not OEM. Had to return it
4,Lit up my fire!,"Found the book very easy to read and understand. I had purchased the book which was very highly recommended for feng shui, sacred space and geobiology consultations. Great information in regards to form and compass school but not much on flying stars."
3,Charmingly Gossipy,"Covers the same basic information you find in most feng shui books these days. Does have more of a Taoist twist with more emphasis on religious ceremonies for space clearing, exorcisms, etc. More interestingly, it is chock full of gruff, grandfatherly style anecdotes ""as told to the author"" as regards the superstitious end of feng shui. Not to be seriously compared with Lillian Too, but nice to have to get some perspective on how feng shui is approached and used in the Orient in its popular, ""unsanitized"" version. Nuggets of arcane information."
1,"Snore, snore","""Harden My Heart"" was a huge hit single in late 1981. It is standard MOR fare, heard today on shopping mall sound systems across America.What is astonishing is that this band managed to, albeit briefly, make a career out of recording this same song over and over. ""Right Kind of Love,"" and ""Take me To Heart,"" (from another album) for example, are almost paint by numbers duplicates. The public bought it for a while but then wised up, and this snooze of a band has not been heard from since."
4,Where is Rindy Ross ?,Quarterflash as led by the vocal talents of Rindy Ross is so hip! What a unique sound. She has such a delicate and vulnerable sound in her voice. Her sax is her soul speaking to you. I wish I would have had a school teacher like her. I would still be there. Where is she now?
5,Their Only #1 Album,"It's to bad that this was Quarter Flash's only #1 album. But, this is a MUST have album for anyones collection of 80's best. With songs like ""Harden My Heart"", ""Find Another Fool"" &""Williams Ave"" this will not disappoint who ever adds this to their list of great LP's of the 80's. If you like a little saxaphone in your songs, then this LP is for you!"
5,Let's Go Series....always a good buy,"I bought this book because I had a class assignment but I also bought it because when I lived in Spain years ago, I actually used an older version to get me by.The Let's Go Series is so amazingly on point in Europe which is the only place I'ver tried it so far (Germany, Spain, France, etc)I'll be using it next in Brazil. It's so much more in depth and accurate and enjoyable than most of the other travel guides.If you're going anywhere in the world, definitely pick up one of the Let's Go series"
5,Got to have is fishing the San Juan,"New to the San Juan. You will need this book, also stop by the local Orvis Fly Shop for ""what's hot today""."
2,The formatting is awful in Kindle version of this book,"My daughter is receiving NAET treatment for autism and I like to get more background information. However, the formatting of the ebbok in chapters 7 and chapter 9 are awful. Numbering for bullet points were wrong and items are packed together and not properly separated which make the most informative part extremely difficult to read. Think about it before you buy the Kindle version of this book.Hope that the amazon can fix it and provide a free update."
1,Absolute False,This is absolute false. I spent thousands of dollars on this treatment with no change/improvement at all. Feel free to contact me.People like these are victimizing us parents of autistic kids.
1,False hope given,"This book's title gives false hope. Parents of children with autism desperatly want to think that there is a cure. But, there is no cure for autism, only management of the disorder.(People buying this book should note that the author is not a medical doctor but a chiropractor.)"
1,STAY AWAY! ADVERTIZED AS BULK BUT THIS IS ONLY 1 BOX,I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WAS A BULK UNIT SALE. THERE ARE ONLY 20 BAGS WITH AN EXTRA 5; YOU CAN GET THIS IN ANY LOCAL MARKET FOR $6 MORE OR LESS. I AM TOTALLY DISABLED AND HOME BOUND SO I TRY TO BUY BULK ITEMS IF IT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PRICE. THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF! I THOUGHT AMAZON DID A BETTER JOB OF NOT POSTING ITEMS LIKE THIS.I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN ROBBED!
4,helpful information,I ordered this book to obtain a nutrition certification. It contains valuable information for those interested in natural health. I have used it occasionally as a reference book.
1,Forever Nineteen,Story line was weak and it did not contain as much information as I thought it would.
5,my favorite book to have in the studio,This book is so informative. It really focuses on hands on approaches to using a wide range of mediums and materials. Its in my studio right now AND I USE IT!
2,deceived,i bougth the book to know more on the making of abstract painting. The more i read the most frustrated i was about this book. one of the chapterss is about acrylic painting...a poor chapter...if you want to learn abstract art do not buy this book
1,Not the best book for beginners !,"As an artist who has never worked on abstract art, this book was a difficult to navigate and comprehend. It does faithfully deal with conceptual aspects of abstract art but I was disappointed with the limited attention paid to the technique aspect. Having said that, I am sure it would be a great book for a moderate or advanced painter who have worked their way through the basic nuances of abstract art."
2,Lacks sufficient instruction,"This book's images are impressive and provide motivation for the novice to explore abstract paintings. However, it really does not go into enough detailed instruction so that techiniques can be applied in the studio. I can't recommend this book except for those painters who 1) already have some experience with abstraction, and 2) novices who want a general introduction and can find other sources to help answer technical questions. It's a pretty book with little technical substance."
3,"Conceptually Decent, But Not Much on Technique","I bought this book to help with my abstract formulation in painting. For basic concept, it's good, but a little bit elementary for anyone with a moderate foundation in art. The interesting parts of the book are in the last 15 pages or so, but the entire book does have nice abstract imagery examples throught it. I think the authors assembled this without the end-goal in mind. Even the preface starts by discussing what a daunting task it was to assemble this many abstract pieces and make them fit together in a book. What I think they might have done better is to write the book and THEN find abstract examples of the concepts. This book tries to be all things painting, but fails to delve seriously into the subject it purports to discuss - abstract."
3,"Lotta theory, little how-to","There aren't many books on technique where abstract art is concerned. I understand that by its nature, each abstract painting is a new invention, and may not relate solidly to anything else. Even so, artists like me who want to create abstract works would be grateful to know how to generate certain effects with certain techniques and materials.This book falls short in this dimension. It's filled with windy theory, and woefully lacking in practical information. There are many examples of abstract works (some good, some not), but virtually no clear information on how they were produced. Biggest weakness: there are no step-by-step photos to clarify the text and provide insights into the examples.The book is not totally useless. If you can get through the turgid prose, there are a few nuggets of information you may find of value. But I suppose it'll have to do till somebody turns out something better."
4,no brainer with alot of heart,"the missing star only applies to spoiled ears, overly accustomed to modern standards of reproduction. if you understood the beauty of analog sound over digital when it was an issue, this was one of your exemplary recordings. Performance-wise?the das lied is a wonder of pacing, rosbaud pays shrewd attention to nuance. brilliant interlacing of vocal lines with the orchestra. trinkel sounds scrappy, bowed bloodied but unbroken, the rest get better as you keep listening.bruckner: i wont be able to do it justice. just listen (theres soundbites around here somewhere, aren't there?)"
3,not quiet,"This is really not quiet at all, except when it's turned off.Nice remote and programing functions."
2,"Flippin' LOUD!!! Don't Believe the ""Quiet"" Part.","This unit and the programmable version 17000 are NOT at all quiet. I foolishly bought them sight-unseen (or sound-unheard) because of Honeywell's advertizing claims of quiet operation. They are LOUD my friends, so much so that I can hear them three rooms away on the lowest setting. Forget about setting them on high, the noise level is intolerable. At least the programmable unit lets you set a timer to turn it down or off automatically before you get home so you don't have to do it manually every day. I feel that I was deceived in order to make a sale. I guess 'quiet' is a matter of opinion. It IS quiet compared to an atomic blast."
2,not quiet,i purchased this item a while ago and returned it immediately. it's not quiet and is very bulky.
3,More Info Please,You do not provide the model number of the Honeywell air purifier. I need to know if you carry replacement filters for it or not and what is the cost of filters?? Would also be helpful to know how often filters need to be changed. I would also be interested in the purpose of remote control for the unit.
4,Less noisy and worth it.,"While being quieter than most, it still does its job!We use it in our family room where our quite active fireplace is. The three speeds are a definite plus, but we only really use the low and high speeds.High speed definitely moves its share of air, but don't plan on watching TV while it's running unless you raise the volume quite a bit. With the amount of dust the fireplace puts out, the unit has definitely reduced the amount of dust around our home."
2,Poor quality,I purchase one of these for a family member awhile back and should have asked how they like it. Turns out they don't use it much because it is so loud and buzzes. This a poor quality product. The fan is out a balance or hitting something inside the unit. It buzzes and shakes when on low or med. setting. I have to turn it up on high and let it run for awhile then take it down to medium in order for it to run smoothly. The unit is way too loud to run on high all the time. The life time filter is a joke and should not be advertized as such. It even says in the Manuel that it needs to be replaced every few years or so. I can't remember at the moment.Update: This unit stopped working. It will not turn on anymore. I guess it really is a life time air filter. It lasted the life time of the unit of almost a month.
4,QuietCare for Medium to Medium/Large Rooms,"This is an excellent unit. Thorough air circulation, programmable, and I like the filter status indicator.The only problem I have with it is the noise. For this purifier to be true to its name with the low setting, use it in a room that is 20' x 20' or greater. When I am 10' or less from it, I can hear sharp and high-pitched sounds from the airflow. The big sound of air whooshing doesn't bother me, it's the higher stuff.I also have a large EnviraCaire HEPA unit that has comparable purification with a lower airflow note.To use this in a smaller room I run it 15-20 min. on med or high; then I can come back to the room and switch it off. Of course mileage will vary depending how easily allergens get back into the room. I'd consider buying another unit anytime."
3,Quiet when on low...,"I live in Chicago. It is very dusty here...all the time. There is no point in dusting my apartment more than once every few weeks because 3 days later the dust settles again. The dust has more recently started to affect my allergies, which I did not seem to have problem with until a few years ago. I thought a product like this air purifier would help. I started using when I would go to bed. I have it in the bedroom and I flip it on in the afternoon and by the evening the air should should theoretically be cleaner. I began to notice within the first week or so I could breathe better when I woke up. So, as far as I can tell, it does help clear the air. As far as the quiet...not so much. I cannot compare it to other purifiers, but when it is on high it is loud. It makes watching tv or reading distracting. However, on it's low setting it is pretty quiet. Lately, I have been leaving it on med. all day."
2,loud,I purchased two of these items because the reviews were favorable. they are ok for daytime use but not when trying to sleep. have not noticed much difference in air quality.
3,Noisy but good,"The machine ""Quietcare"" is far from Quiet - but the great thing is that younever have to buy a filter - you just rinse it out. That is a big plus."
3,QuietCare is a misnomer,"This air purifier works fine, but don't be misled by the name QuietCare. Even on the lowest fan speed, it's still pretty loud. We run it during the day, but we have to turn it off at night because it's so loud."
1,Bartok play by G. Sandor,Sandor's playing is brilliant and technical flawless. His interpretations of these great Bartok masterpieces is as historic as they are well-fashioned. One might take issue with the historic recording quality and the standard technical and intonation issues of the orchestras recorded at that time. But if you want vibrant and memorable recordings with lasting value this set is for you.
5,I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.,The story of Kristin and Cole is a wonderful love story about two strong willed people who come together and learn how to love. I enjoyed this book immensly. The story of Shannon and Malachi is also well written and an absolute page turner. I can't wait until Jaime has his story released.
5,Captivating romantic fiction,I could not put this book down. What an escape from everyday life. Has the author written a sequel? Author's notes point to a continuation of Malachi and Shannon's stroy. I see no further reference to a second book! Please tell me it was written.....Amazon please send a response.
4,DARK STRANGER is a great book.,Dark Stranger by Heather Graham Pozzessere embodies perhaps of the classic conflicts in the romance genre: following in love with your enemy. But with her trademark writing style Graham carries it off with style and grace. I like the fact the heroine is feisty and not afraid of voicing her opinion. Kristin's a historical romance amzaon warrior. Cole is cool too. And the civil war is classic and classy backdrop for the story to be set in. I would definitely recommend this book to any Heather Graham fan.
5,Great product!,"This cleaning solution is great. It does a better job than other cleaning solutions I've used with a regular mop, and it gets the job done faster. I use it in my kitchen, bathroom, and all the hardwood floors in my entire house. I have a 7 month old baby that crawls everywhere, so clean floors are important in our household.I don't believe in any of the negative urban legends that are being spread around about this product. I feel that this product is safe, if used properly, like all household cleaning chemicals.I give it 5 stars, because it's truly the best and most convenient I've ever used in my home."
1,Do NOT Order!!!!!,"It took a week for the Candy Banditt Store to contact me and tell me my order had been cancelled!!!! Out of Stock,but.....still showing it in stock!!!!"
2,cheap means cheap!,The main reason I purchased this drill was for the batteries. However the batteries in this Chinese reproduction is about half the amp hours of normal drill that Makita produces.Not the real thing!
5,Get Lots of Hugs and Kisses,"I don't understand it, but my 17 month old loves this book. She will ask me to read it repeatedly. That is okay, because I can always coax a few hugs and kisses out of her when we do read the book.The book itself is very simple and takes less than a minute to read. The pictures are great though of many babies and parents getting hugs and kisses. She will point at each page and say ""baby."""
5,Love this book!,"We are long-time fans of baby books with faces as the primary ""art"". This is a new series for us and we LOVE it! My daughter really enjoys seeing the babies and the ""story"" helped us teach her more about hugs and kisses (which she doles out often now!). Great choice!"
3,This one is just ok,I bought both Baby Faces by DK Publishing and this Hugs & Kisses book. Our baby loves the Baby Faces book by far. Hugs & Kisses doesn't have as many pages and it's not as durable as Baby Faces.
4,Great then and now,I first read this to my son at age 15 mos and he loved looking at the baby faces. Now at age 3 he reads the book to me and he still loves its.
5,One of Libby's favorites!,This is another great book in the baby faces series. I can say the book aloud and my daughter starts laughing.
3,Alright,Not nearly my childs favorite book that I had hoped but it still is decent. She likes books with more involvement - sounds/ color/ touch to it. She is my first child so hopefully the next ones will like it more.
4,Crime does not pay,"The story of Sante and Kenny Kimes is widely known since their murder trial last year. But here we now have all the details under one cover. It is amazing to realize that one single human being can accomplish every crime imaginable, from shoplifting to murder. Sante sure has a focused negative mind, like a black marketeer who cannot envision a legal deal. And, like a gambling addict, she has to feed her habit. Amazing is the fact that she is basically dumb: all her major deals went wrong.Kent, her oldest son who wrote this book, tells us that he has weaned himself from his mother. Yet he still calls her Mom and constantly mentions his love for her. I thought it very telling that in the many pictures he added to the book he constantly shows his mother - but never his father.The book is completely disorganized, jumping around in time, location and subject. Properly edited, it could have been shortened considerably."
4,A truly dysfunctional family...,"Written with insight by Sante Kimes eldest son, Kent Walker, this is a story of an extremely dysfunctional family. Sante Kimes and her youngest son, Kenny Kimes, committed various crimes, starting with shoplifting and fraud, and working their way up to murder. It is an unbelievably sickening and twisted tale, but fascinating nonetheless. It is indeed fortunate that Sante and Kenny were both convicted of their many crimes, and will probably never see the light of day."
3,It takes a con to con a con,"Not a bad read, but I (and my coworkers who also read it) had the feeling that the author was using the book as a means for vindication. My workmates thought that he is trying to convince the American public that--in spite of his mother & brother--he's not such a bad guy. Maybe, maybe not.While, his book was entertaining and educational, some sections were a ""little out there"". In other words, he shoulda toned down a bit in order to come across w/ more credibility.He does have a serious story to tell, a majority of which appears to have been verified through the judicial process. And, he has proven that he is a survivor.While Ann Rule doesn't have to worry about Kent Walker taking over her turf, it's a good thing to hear such a story from someone who lived it!I'd still wait until it came out in paperback before springing for it!"
5,Great book,"An amazing true story of a dysfunctional family where the child overcame an incredible childhood and was able to become a responsible, loving adult."
5,Son of a Grifter,Absolutely riveting! Mr. Walker goes into a great deal of detail about his family but there are not any slow or boring passages. Highly recommended if you like true crime books.
4,Sante Singhrs,A fascinating look at one of the most evil women to have ever lived. Thank God she did not go into politics!
2,Very subjective,I looked for a book with accurate fact instead of disjointed excuses. The author seemed to have written the book to excuse his own behavior.
5,Joan of Arc: By Herself and Her Witnesses,This book gives you insight to Joan's life that is like nothing else you'll fined. It makes you feel as if you know the woman behind the legend and that is more than worth the price of the book.
4,Joan of Arc,"Joan of Arc was a book about a series of wars between France and England over the feud for the Crown of France. Saved by a women warrior the crown was awarded to it's proper owner, but then the military and nobility backstabbed her and accused her of being a witch. I thought the book was really interesting because of all the action and discrimination against women."
3,"Great book for doing research, not a fun book to read !","This was my first book on Joan of Arc. I was searching for a book that was truthful yet more dramatic, almost a novel. What I found was a book that was trying to tell the story in the most factual accounts possible. There are witnesses that verify many things. For research, this is a fine book. If you just want to learn more about Joan of Arc and have a good time reading, I suggest you look on to other books. Sorry!"
4,Plethora of Styles,"Supported by an impressive array of guest vocalists, Was (Not Was) created an eclectic album of many musical styles with Born To Laugh At Tornados. It contains great ballads and rock songs but most of the music has a dance beat.I love the opening ballad Out Come The Freaks, the up-tempo pop-rock of Smile sung by Doug Fieger and the hilarious Zaz Turned Blue, an old style ballad performed by Mel Torme.I also like Bow Wow Wow Wow, an up-tempo old style rock ` n roll number sung by Mitch Ryder and the funky metal of Shake Your Head, sung by Ozzy Osbourne. Man vs The Empire state Building is a complex, atmospheric piece with nervous rhythms and spooky vocals.Born To Laugh At Tornadoes is a quirky, humorous showcase of the talents of Was (Not Was) and an impressive exploration of various musical styles. Be sure to also give their masterpiece Are You OK? a listen, it's even better than Tornadoes."
4,"Mel Torme, Doug Fieger guest stars","Some songs are filler but Needless to say the overall album is still worthy of at least 4 stars. The version of Out Come the Freaks is Motownish in flavor but hey, these guys are Detroiters. The song I wanted but couldn't find anywhere was The Party Broke Up. The album is worth it for that song alone."
4,delicious sound,"Fluffy headphones - delicious full sound - these headphones are great. The moment I put these on I was in heaven! Some other reviews complain about the headband pinching - I don't know how big their heads are but I've worn these for hours on end in complete comfort. The earpads are completely covered with a soft black fabric, the only complaint I have with the fabric is it manages to attract all kinds of dust, but the earpads ARE removable for cleaning. All in all, you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Soft comfort, Soft Sound",Comfortable but low volume. I think they could have done a better job on the volume output.
3,needed volume control,Sound ok.the ear pads are to thin.one hour is the maximum before ear problems because of thin pads.the volume control is great.
2,Didn`t sound as good as my Sony MDR 7506.,Too much hype. Didn`t have the presence that my Sony MDR 7506 phones have. Like listening through filters. I like the clean RAW SOUND.
5,Perfect plant stand,"I've had this stand for over a year now, and I really like it. It was easy to put together, it is very sturdy (not lopsided) on hardwood or tile, and it looks great. For the most part, the pictures are accurate representations, but the metal appears a little less brown and more gold in person."
3,quite amusing but very repetitive,"A small pocket sized book that basically says if he doesn't call - he's not that into you.Some funny comments, quotes and sections though. Fun for a light read."
4,Fact not Fiction,"Well, i was skeptical about this book at first, as i am about most dating and self help books, after all, everyone is different right.The fact is, women are nurturers, we tend to gloss over things and evenmake excuses for men, many of us have been wrongly told how to interpretmen's behavior. Unbeknownst to me, a great many men would rather die thanhurt your feelings? Really? so that behavior that we call, sketchy, erratic, the distance, the tension, alot of times, (not all) he is trying to tell us something. If he is dismissive, unattentive, if he's not calling, if he's not showing us attention, he's just not that into you. I hate to say it but i saw myself in a great many of the letters written to the authors, I have made excuses and wasted time and well, just clung to that hope, because i wasn't able to interpret behavior, Often with men, the way they act is how things are, its that simple, It really is.This book will save me alot of time in the future."
2,Not what I thought:(,Well I never saw the movie and I only read a page or two before I bought it. It just wasn't what I thought:( I wasn't impressed.
1,jcramsey200,"this was ordered the middle of March. As of this date, 4-22-09, I have not recieved the book. I emailed him last week, but have not got a response. If I don't hear anything by the end of the week, or receive the order, I will have to contact amazon.com. Beware of this Seller!"
3,I was just not into this!,"This book did not meet expectations. I had really liked the movie, and this book was a major disappointment.Found many of the recommendations quite extreme, and even repetitious. Basic advice was ""Dump him"" over and over again.I felt the book could have been more humorous too.2.8stars."
3,funny,I had fun reading this. Made me laugh. Made me think how some guys treat women. Some of the quotes and advise were actually good. Everything was numbered. A lot of the stuff was repetitious...just worded differently. I enjoyed reading this.
3,its okay,its an okay book. brings up many good points but the only downer for me personally is that they make the same point over and over. being more a bitch makes your relationship better.
1,Al Franken is a BIG FAT IDIOT!!,"This recording of his book makes fun of Rush Limbaugh, and never proves that he is an idiot. Al Franken is proving how fat and idiodic Al Franken is. Do not buy this if you are a republican!!!!!"
2,A disposable [$$$] MP3 player,"The battery this machine uses is proprietary to the Sony MP3 line up. NOBODY sells this battery.. including amazon.com. you have to go straight to sony to buy it for [$$$].The small size attracted me to this unit. I used it heavily for about 9 months to bike with. The battery slowly gave up the ghost. Now I guess I will pay another [$$$] for hopefully 9 months of usage.PS>> Ditto on the comment regarding the software being hard to manage as listed on other comments.-Scott MeekerSavannah,"
5,Reliable and clear,"I have used my sony everyday for the past year. I love the size, it allows me to run and listen with no hassel."
4,Love it!!!,"I just got this baby today from Amazon Marget Place. I fall in love with it right away. The player is very small, very light, really stylist, and sound great. OpenMG Jukebox Software is very simple to manage. Took me about 5 mins to learn how to import and transfer files. Only drawback is the padded carrying case. It seem to protect the player but you need to take player out to operate. I think it would be nice if it has armband or belt clip."
3,"Great, but with one or two prblems","This product is easy to use and sounds really good. It's the best on short flights or excercising, but the battery doesnt always charge when left in the charger overnight. There is no light on the charger to tell if it charging... Sometimes I will leave it in the charger all night and in the morning 50/50 chance its charged.... Also the fact I have to use Sony's software to load songs on id kind of a pain as it isnt that well thought out..."
1,wrong size,didn't fit my oven...cost too much to return...wasted my money...can't find what I need for my oven. not too happy
5,As advertised..perfect,"As everyone who has one of these, they get nasty over the years..had to swap for a new one..works perfect..lol"
5,Sweet Peas,"I loved this Rugrats show, I was disapointed that Grandma Lou Lou and Kira were not in it and Howard. It had a very cute story line and I relly loved seeing Tommy and Angelica get up and sing together."
5,But oil for firearms and knives!,"My family has used 3-in1 oil for generations for firearms, knives, and tools. Don't fall for expensive gun oils. This oil does it all. The only stipulation is that if you have a wood stock that is dry use a little boiled linseed oil on the wood first to prevent shrinkage. Also works great as a honing oil, and a good cutting oil."
1,I never Got it,If it came to my home for XMas it never got here .Why I just don't know !!!Did some one pick it up at my door the people where I live here in Vegas I don't put it pass them .if that see a box they mite pick it up I don't know .I do know that some on goo in to my trash can from time to time .I saw them Why for the Cans ????Live suck here in Nevada !!
4,Classic from my younger days,True classic tracks from a band few remember these days. The digital version sounds great and took me back to my younger days
4,Glam,"Glitter, Glam, Power Pop, Girl Power at it's best. Spice(rack)Girls got nothin' on these 2 gals from Plunstead England. The track ""Shiny Black Taxi Cab"" (Go to club, get drunk, throw up in Taxi) is just plain fun. ""Game boy"" has the best melody on the album. ""House of Love"" was meant for a huge dance floor and tons of screaming clubkidz. But by far the song ""Delicious"" is worth shelling out the cash for this disc. It's a pop song if I've ever heard one. I definatly recomend this CD if you like late 80's glam rock, The Electric Angels, or just being in a good mood."
2,Pretty pictures without substance,"I read the book in a html class title, ""the electronic book"" at california state school. The instructor passed the book around for everyone to read and learn from, but the only thing the book really has is pretty colors. The book is too simplistic and does not provide practical, useful, detailed analysis of how to create optimized graphics and html code. It is a good book for inspiration, but not a book for people who are serious about pushing web pages beyond where it is now."
1,Where's the fly fishing in this fly fishing movie?,"The vast majority of this movie shows the guys driving in a car, talking around a tent site, hanging out at a bar, or traveling in a boat. Very little fly fishing in this movie. If you are into watching a bunch of guys sit around and talk, by all means buy this video immediately. The actual steelheading footage in this movie looks like it was pieced together last minute. Short 5 second clips of them holding steelheads. The longest sustained fly fishing footage in the video (20 seconds) was showing a guy tangled up in his line who had never spey casted before. Borderline unwatchable."
5,Excellent Reference Book for Non Native Speakers of English in the Medical Field.,"I have taught English to international health and medical professionals for the past five years and would say that this is a 'must have' book for any non-native speaker of English in the Medical profession. The book is an easy to use reference book, with very practical information. There are many sample letters, sample conversations with patients, formats for oral presentations, formats for writing a medical journal article and more. I'm using it now with a Japanese researcher here in the US as she prepares to present her research at a conference. This book is giving her the confidence to challenge the task of presenting in front of native speakers. She will also use this book when she returns to her country in order to maintain contacts and connections she has made here in the US."
5,EXCELLENT - Must have for Da Vinci lovers and art students,This book is a treasure. Many little known works are contained within these 94 pages and the treatise of each is impeccable. I own many in this series but this is my favorite. A great compilation for the serious student or those who simply appreciate getting to know this artist a bit more intimately. It is a shame they are out of print.
4,Good value!,"This book had authentic, accurate costume information with nice commentary from the author at the beginning. Also had helpful reference information to help understand and use the patterns. I felt I was a lady of the 1800's reading the magazine for the first time."
5,Loving my Tarot Book,"Several years ago I bought the Tarot cards I'm using and even though they came with a book it just wasn't making sense to me. When I was looking through Tarot books on Amazon I found the Complete Idiot's Guide to Tarot and got it. I was sure it would make more sense than the book I had. It's the best purchase I've made since I got the cards! Truly, it's easy to understand and I've learned more in the last month with this book than I've learned in the years since I got the cards with the book. Very well written, easy to understand and while I'm not ready to put out a shingle....who knows? Maybe one day.Brightest Blessings,Sharon"
5,Good!,"It's good, complete, helpful, beatiful... i like it and here in Brazil, i didn't find any biography like this. I recommend!"
5,The CIG Tarot 2nd Ed is the most used Tarot book I own,"I have always been interested in tarot, and had some readings, but never understood how it all worked together. Then I found this wonderful text at the recommendation of a friend, and I was hooked. I used it as a textbook, learned from the easy examples, and the wonderful modern arch-types. Now the CIG group has updated it with current findings, clarifications, and readings for our current times.Don't believe me, go out and pick it up or read the chapter Amazon provides. The quality and intuitive nature of the book stands out. I've already bought my copy of this new edition, and I've made gifts to good friends who have been interested in Tarot for a long time.I couldn't have asked for a better guide or a better set of exercises, and neither could you! I finally am starting to trust my intuition due to my start with learning Tarot with this volume.Blessed Be!"
2,No really good plans for a experienced woodworker,Very dissapointed with the book. Not useful. Very basic stuff.Who would want a birdhouse out of an old soda bottle?
1,Ingredients not disclosed,"Description does not reveal the other ingredients in the tablet, I would not have purchased if I had known what else was in it. I assumed it was only Beta Sitosterol"
5,Very Good Cable,"I needed plenum cable for a special project, this is some of the better plenum cable I have used. It is good quality, easy to handle and run and the individual solid wires are easy to work with.If you don't know if you need plenum cable, plenum cable is made with a fire retardant casing that also reduces toxic fumes if it does burn.It is for use in ""plenum"" areas, for example, ventilation areas above a ceiling, inside ducts or in an area that is part of the pressure or return system in a heating, cooling or ventilating system. Local fire codes usually dictate the requirements. That is why plenum cable is more expensive.I will use this cable again."
4,"Great music for kids, but a little dated","These songs, including ""10 Crunchy Carrots,"" ""I Wanna Be a Dog,"" ""Octopus"" (although we refer to it as ""Slippery Fish""), and ""I am a Pizza"" are great for preschoolers. My daughter is in a program for autistic toddlers, and one day I realized she was singing ""Slippery Fish!"" I was excited that she had learned the song in school, and I just happened to know it. We really bonded over that song :-) We got the video with high hopes. It is a little corny in places, but the songs are all very good."
1,The Story of Mozart,Bad to say the CD start but it dos not continue is necesary to manipulate.I payed for something original.
5,"A romantic,exiting,sad,funny book, all in one!","This book is a compelling, enchanting, wonderful story. It follows the adventures of Jessica and Elizabeth's ancestors.I would really reccomend this book to anybody!!! My favorite times were the twenties, when the twins were fighting over the same gentelmen's heart. It was the most romantic part of the book. The most exiting part was the late 1800's, when one of the twins goes off to join the circus, and the other twin dies a tragic death. It was so well written, it made me cry! It made me laugh! I loved it"
5,great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i thought it was the BEST book i have ever read! they have a very good family tree.and it was a cool book!it was from the 1880s to the 1960s.over 120 years of their family.everyone should read it!
5,classic,i used to read sweet valley all the time from the school library and i read all of them. i dont care for the newer ones that are out now.
3,"On the right track, but....","100 times is clearly too few, and who has time for more?And by the way you can't do this in meetings at work. I've tried."
2,Disappointed in Delaware,"As an automobile machanic, excercising my sphincter comes naturally. So, when Hiroyuki Nishigaki's book became available in the states, I jumped on it. I have to say though, after a thourough read, I still don't quite get what I'm supposed to do. I tighten my sphincter. I push out the dirty spirits, but I still feel stressed, especially when I have deadlines to meet. Who can help me?"
2,Still trying to make it work,"I bought this book hoping to relieve some of the daily melancholy permeating my existence. However I have a problem with the constriction exercises. It seems, and indeed friends I have queried confirmed, that my sphincter is already in a perpetually constricted state, even to a profound degree.(One 'friend' even suggested that my gas passing could only be audible to a canine)."
3,Liked his first book better,"As someone who is somewhat of an expert in homeopathic procedures, I was a big fan of Mr. Nishigaki's first book ""Sphinctericity: Flatulating Your Way Out of Post-Partum Depression"". It was, no joke, a miracle and the fact that my poor husband Don is alive and not shoved into my Braun juicer is proof of this!Sadly, this important book is out of print. Mr. Nishigaki's sophomore effort isn't as powerful. The force, the urgency, of Sphinctericity is lacking in this new book. I felt like he was holding it in, sneaking out little squeaks of information instead of letting it rip. After finishing the book, I was reminded of that schoolyard poem: ""Here I sit, brokenhearted..."""
5,How to Good-bye Depression: If You Constrict Anus 100 Times Everyday,"Been in my ""buy it later"" queue for years. So glad to finally have this book in my hands. Still working up to 100 anal constrictions a day, but getting stronger every day!"
4,One word: Audiobook.,"I think James Earl Jones is just the man we need to read this. However, I'm sure that Gilbert Gottfried could do an excellent job as well. Let's all cross our fingers."
4,A fine sampling of Engrish,"The first half of this book is purely usenet cut and pastes. To be honest, I picked this book up 3 years ago and I had no expectations. When I read the first chapter, I was so blown away, my anus instinctively constricted. In reality this book is truly about one man's quest to discover the secrets of the anus and navel. A truly funny reading if you can stomach intentionally bad grammar and ethereal logic."
2,What now??,"I did everything the book told me to. 100 buttock squeezes and stomach churning suck in positioning actions. I have lost control of my most excelling bowels but my stomach active goings are doing the suck in-out actions. Now what? Now I am depressed about wearing paper Hello Kitty Brand Adult Containment Pants. Hello Kitty will does nothing but make insultments. I need sake in large warm mugs now.I cut myself now. Good thing I make amount paid for the bleeding coverings.Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages, Hello Kitty Decorated Bandages, 20-Count Assorted Sizes (Pack of 3)"
2,Maybe it's actually Malarkey.,"I am afraid I must chime in and say that I didn't find this book very helpful. It was recommended by my doctor, whom I now regard as somewhat of a quack. One of the more ludicrous claims the books makes is that constricting one's anus _more_ than the 100 times per day recommended is not suggested and can lead to health problems. I can say with absolute assurance (pardon the pun.. continuing) that constricting the anal muscles MANY more times than simply one hundred times daily has had no adverse effect on me whatsoever. In fact, I'm constricting it right now as I write this, and I've been doing it all day, almost non-stop. Certainly totalling upwards of 1000 times.In other words, the book seemed very attractive to me based on its subject matter due to what I already brought to it from personal experience, yet I received no new information whatsoever and, in fact, a great deal of MISinformation was, instead, imbued.Thanks for listening."
3,How to Good-Bye Depression: If You Constrict Anus 100 Times Everyday. Malarkey? or Effective Way?,"There had been quite a bit of ridicule concerning this book, but I suspected that the reasons that lent itself to such a reaction was due to the subject matter combined with the fact that the author's English language skills were not easily understood within the framework of standard American English. It was quite a challenging read in certain regards however, if taken seriously, I think there are some benefits that can be derived from the variety of practices that he puts forth."
3,"NOT Malarkey, Effective Way!","As I sit here typing this, while constricting my anus, I can't help but consider how thoughtful and timely this book was. I ALREADY am reaping the benefits of Mr. Nishigaki's ""anal-fountain-of-youth"", even though it has only been a short morning's-worth of anus constriction.I have quickly begun to ""erase my bad sticky feeling"", and am feverishly working on the ""secret of shooting out [my] immaterial fibers or third attention to [my] work from [my] body"".With focused effort, and continued application, I have no doubt that I'll soon be ""making * * * three times in succession without drawing out.""A lovely treatise on the power of positive-sphincking.PS Added bonus; if all goes well, I'll be able to use my anus as a pencil sharpener...."
2,only mild success,"since reading this book, I have attempted to put it into practice, but with only minor results. I am an elderly gentleman and generally quite fit, and I have found that yes, my buttocks are tauter and I no longer retain as much 'ballast' (cutting down on my prune bill) but it has done little to alleviate the crippling despair and blackness that threatens to crash down at any moment, like a heavy velvet curtain crushing my ribcage until I can't breathe."
5,You look great Stanley!,"This DVD gives you a great look at Stanley Turrentine.This tenor man played with Jimmy Smith, Gene Harris, andon all kinds of Blue Note recordings. He had it going.This is in color , clear, good sound, and an interview with Stanley that includes a look at Coleman Hawkinsand John Coltrane, in short video clips. Stanley looksgreat, sounds great, because he was."
5,The Smooth Superlative Tenor Sax of Stanley Turrentine,"Having seen Stanley Turrentine many times in concert, it was a thrill to receive this video. It was like being there again. Now that we sadly will not be able to attend any more of Stanley's magical concerts, it made us so happy to be able to have that experience again on this video. No one plays it better or smoother than Stanley, and hearing his music is amazing. And actually seeing him connect with his horn is a unique experience for everyone having had the privilege to see him do so. You will love this video if you are a Stanley fan or just love the beautiful melodic sound of the sax. Stanley is the best of the tenors and will be sadly missed. Having this video is like watching a memory. Don't miss it."
2,lousy buckle looks like crap,nothing much to say that the pics make it seem chromed and its just dull grey metal...not much else to say but The review needs more words to publish...
5,The best bug story around!!!,"This is such a fantastic book-I cannot rave enough!! It is a story of a bug contest to determine which bug is the ""bugliest"" of them all. Of course Dilly, our heroine, is filled with self-doubt and low esteem but she attends anyway. Well, she proceeds to save the day but I won't reveal how it ends.The story is a great learning tool about the different types of insects and their characteristics. Moreoever, it is filled with self-esteem and basic character education.In the back of the book, you get free bug trading cards loaded with information on the various insects featured in the story. This book is thoroughly entertaining and educationally sound!"
5,Nice book,"A good book, but though it said ""LIKE NEW"" the dust jacket was smudged and a bit dirty. I cleaned it up carefully with a damp cloth and windex. Now it's like new. Love the book though and fit in perfectly with my granddaughter's themed bug-land garden party!"
3,Be careful! This is very subpar playing in boxy mono,"HOrenstein is a great musician, but he was stuck in the Vox years with dismal orchestra and very poor mono sound. YOu get both in these two perfomances. I for one couldn't listen to them for all that I admire the conductor."
2,No replacement DVd,"I just spoke with a representative of Warner Home Video. There is no and there never has been any intention of replacing the edited DVD with an unedited DVD. Really sad that the few that would be ""offended"" by the unedited version dictates what the rest of us watch. The majority does not rule. If anybody knows any other info, please post."
1,what is this crap..?,"i bought this set because the back of the box said the cartoons were uncut. well they WERENT UNCUT & sadly I wasn't at all surprised. I immediatley returned it for a refund. I won't spend a penny on edited cartoons. It's just absolutely infuriating, frustrating & depressing"
1,WARNING EDITED CARTOONS,"I loved Tom and Jerry when I was a kid. I was thinking that maybe the dvd set of this would be unedited. But of course not. WASTE OF MONEY IF YOU CANT GET THE UNEDTIED VERSIONS. There isnt one single cartoon here either with Mammy Two Shoes. And another reviewer said ""The Little Orphan"" episode is edited and they are correct, the scene is missing where Tom gets burnt up by the candle. All the cartoons presented are good though, but to dish out money for something edited, I may as well watch cartoon network. I looked on Ebay and seems there is a 140 cartoon set of Tom and Jerry available from China. Its around $40 bucks. Think I'll spend my money over there to get the true unedited cartoon set I been dreaming of. Just a quick note, the cartoons here even though no Mammy and the edited content, are 5 star cartoons, just dont appreciate spending money for edited cartoons."
5,Re-living my childhood,"Looney Tunes, Droopy and Tom & Jerry were some of my favorite cartoons when I was growing up and it's great to see that they're finally getting released on DVD sets since they're not shown on TV anymore. None of these newer cartoons even compare to these and probably none ever will. These classics are definately worth picking up and definately have alot of replay value."
5,Cat and Mouse toons.....,"Greetings All, My partner and I just love these two! The copies are clear, color is wonderful and the sound is great! Very happy with transaction and would buy from seller again! Cheers! William"
1,A good collection BUTTTTTT!!,"This is the spotlight of Tom and Jerry and while the older fans would be hurt I gotta say it really is bad AND MONOTONOUS I mean how long are we gonna Tom getting hurt and outsmarted by jerry? 10 times, 2000 times, 10000000000000000000000000000000000 times I mean as the new characters would say ""OH COME ON"" So if you want this painful collection and this review did not change your mind Go ahead but I warned you."
5,Get these DVD's : Classic Cartoons worth their weight!,the DVD collection really does the T&J; series justice. These are great DVD's that will last for years. The kids LOVE them. This is never on TV like it was for me when I was a kid so I wanted to ensure that my kids got the same experience. These cartoons are classic and the animation is spot-on.LOVE this ... Get this DVD for your collection.Note; please don't steal DVD's from the internet. It's wrong. Purchase them like the rest of the honest population does.
2,dvd,Both dvds were scratched. I will have to take them to the local video store to refinish dvds at 1.99 each.
5,"CAT AND MOUSE, 40 GREAT CARTOONS. 3 in WIDESCREEN!","This new set of classic Tom and Jerry cartoons is terrific. Not a dud in the group, 40 classic shorts made by Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera when they worked at MGM, including all the Oscar winners. The cartoons look and sound good, but the real surprise is TOUCHE PUSSYCAT!. Not only is it enhanced for 16x9 widescreen TVs, but it is TRULY IN STEREO! Something no cartoon from MGM ever was.Obviously Warner Bros. took the time to go back to their original recordings and make a new stereo track for this delightful cartoon, and the sound will amaze you. The images are also crisp and clear and take fine advantage of the wide CinemaScop screen.This is a must for audiences of all ages!"
5,So much fun!,"Just like how i remembered these cartoons to be! I love them! Too bad, that there is only 2 spotlight collection and not more..."
4,The BEST of T&J. Keeps my kids in stitches!,"Nothing is better than seeing your 4-year-old laughing out loud to the same cartoons that you laughed at as a kid. My kids love the Hanna/Barberra-era Tom n Jerry cartoons and this DVD set has *all* of the best from that era. The Deitch-produced series don't cut it, and the Chuck Jones-produced shorts are anemic compared to these classics. If you want the best of the Tom and Jerry animated shorts, this set will definitely satisfy."
1,The cartoons are edited!!!!,"WARNING!!!! Even though the box advertises that these cartoons are un-edited and shown in the manner that they were originally made, there are at least three cartoons that have been cut. Check the web for more information, but this is intolerable. We have waited for the un-cut versions of these cartoons for years. We have told WB that we wanted them uncut. WB told us and even advertised that these would be the originals...and now look. Terrible way to treat your customers."
2,Edited and not the greatest quality.,These are edited and cut. I had to call the 800 number to get the replacement disc.Warner Brothers offers an 800 number (see other reviews)so you can get the unedited version. If not for this I would have given this collection maybe 1 star.The cartoons are fantastic and this volume showcase the best ones for the most part. They could have done better restoring them as I have seen much better jobs done on other collections.If you get this collection call Warner to get the copy that they promised.
1,Decided not to buy based on reviews,"After reading the reviews here I've decided not to buy this disk and just keep watching them on youtube where they are mostly unedited.Which is a shame because it would be nice to sit on the couch and see them on the big screen.I'm generally not so picky about things, but think it's crazy that these cartoons are being edited, and really underestimates the intelligence of most viewers.These are works are art, only we tend not to view them that way because they are cartoons and most of us adults watched them on TV on Saturday mornings. But when you consider not only the animation--which is as good as it gets--but the music, the cultural references, they really do stand out as important works of art.We don't edit offensive things in art museums, or important novels because it would be like altering history. Please stop editing the old classic cartoons."
5,TJ hah!,I was happy to see the cartoons I haven't seen in about thirty years.I got my product quickly and in the condition I was promised... Brand new
3,Can't believe how they made the DVDs....,"I've been reading reviews, and i agree... they SHOULD'VE been ALL unedited... all three spotlight collections.... but they WERE edited.. and the 3rd spotlight dvd has 2 episodes excluded from them!! wtf is with tht?! they shuld have ALL of em fully UNedited.... but at least Spotlight 1 & 2 have replacement discs.... but since Spotlight #3 does not, i will not purchase it until further notice......."
4,My review on Tom and Jerry spotlight collection !,Excellent carttoon and cool bouns features reccomand for the children and kids at heart ! Still funny vintage carttoon to watch !
4,DVD Car Portable,I think this is a good dvd car portable. When I compare with others this is a cheap dvd for functionality. We hope to fall the prices but now you have to pay when you are early adopter.
2,Very uninteresting for a child,"My daughter is reading this book and she says the book is very boring to read. Therefore, I took it from her and started reading it and I had to agree with my daughter the book will put you to sleep.I think children's books should be really captivating so that the child's attention is grabbed immediately. Also since the book is a period based book (California Gold Rush time period), it is not something a child in this day and age can relate to either.I will have to find her a more exciting book that she can also relate to as a child in this day and age."
1,it sucks,"I had this laptop for almost 2 years and its money down the drain. I got the ""OS not found"" issue within 8 months and Gateway sent me a new HD. The new HD crashed promptly after my warranty expired. It now looks like there are many folks who have the same problem with this particular laptop. Is there a way that all of us can get together to sue Gateway ?"
1,Don't buy gateway laptops.,Customer support is very poor. It will only work for 6month if you are lucky. Then gateway will fix something to work for another six months. Then after one year they will say your warrentty is over they can't help you. Pl go for some other vendor.
2,"Nope, not one of my all time favorites","This book is what I'd call repetetive and boring. It's not the type of book I'd read if I had no other choice. It was recommended to me and every time I turned the page, I hoped it would get better. But it was basically the same story almost every time. The same idea that racism is hard. We know that. This book states that more times than is necesary. So unless you are terribly interested in Vietnam or black history, I suggest you read something else."
1,Don't buy this!,OMG! This is an awful headphone. It doesn't matter how great the sound is because I can't wear it for more than 10 minutes. My ears and head hurt so bad. IT is super uncomfortable. I am so upset that I brought this piece of junk.
4,Great for iPods,"I bought these headphones about 3 weeks ago. Since then I have also purchased Sennheiser HD212 pro's and HD555's. The 415's are a great upgrade from the OEM earbuds but they do leak sound based on design. My 13 yr old thinks they are great so I am very satisfied, especially based on the purchase price."
3,Ok Not Fabulous,"I've been in radio for 27 years and Sennheiser makes the best headphones on the planet. Period. These, however, are not their best effort. Sure, they sound great and are reasonably comfortable to wear, but the notched headband is not that sturdy and will strip inside of a year. Bring back the ond 414s!!!!!"
5,Absolute Quality,"This Sennheiser has a very unique and clean appearance. It is durably built for years of listening pleasure. It is made to be comfortable. Its sound quality will make you smile. Sennheiser offers superb varieties at affordable pricing for those who enjoy using more than one/two headphones. Essentially, Sennheiser doesn't require a sacrifice to listen to music as the artist wants us to hear it."
1,"Snore, snore","""Harden My Heart,"" from this band's first album, was a huge hit single in late 1981. It is standard MOR fare, heard today on shopping mall sound systems across America.What is astonishing is that this band managed to, albeit briefly, make a career out of recording this same song over and over. ""Take me To Heart,"" and ""Right Kind of Love,"" (the later being from the first album) for example, are almost paint by numbers duplicates. The public bought it for a while but then wised up, and this snooze of a band has not been heard from since."
4,"An absorbing novel , an interesting cast, an excellent read","I had never before read historical fiction, as I usually stick to factual accounts of the Civil War, but this was a great book. It was historically accurate in the events surrounding the Battle of 2nd Manassas, and Tom Wicker does an excellent job intertwining fictional characters with real historic figures. The cast ranges from slaves to generals, reporters and soldiers, and civilians caught in the middle. I particularly liked the portrayal of the general's wife at home alone, scared, and ill-prepared to deal with being master of other human beings and the risks inherent therin. I read it straight through and wanted more. Well worth the read."
4,she moves are the best.,"this is the import album of ""breaking all the rules"".they are 3 girls in the group.this album is worth 40.00 bucks.they rock and ""breaking all the rules"" is one of my fave song ever.i would buy this."
1,More dance-lite junk,"These girls are just more manufactured products of the production line. Their lyrics are bland and uninspiring. They sound like Taylor Dayne for the 90's. ""Breaking all the rules"" is a thinly disguised remake of ""Tell it to my heart"""
4,"Harmless, likeable dance-pop","One of the more obscure 1-hit wonders of the late 90s, there certainly isn't anything deeply profound here, but it's a nice little set of dance-pop with upbeat cheeriness, positive lyrics and nicely crafted if not terribly distinctive arrangements. If you're not in a particularly great mood, pull this out and just kick back to it. It's cheeriness should guarantee that you'll feel better afterwards."
5,FOUR HOOFS UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just finished reading The Red Colt, with my son, Skyler. It was well written, and gives great insight into the actual behind the scenes goings on in the horse racing industry. I highly recommend this book for children of all ages, as well as adults. I look forward to the sequel.???"
3,Mighty fine,The songs here are nice and easy to listen to with excellent vocals. I liked the other two CD's I heard of hers as well.
1,Completely worthless,"How do I even start on this book? A text for a class in college I bought this book looking forward to it, despite the drear subject. As the class progressed I found this book to contain contradicting information in many areas. In addition to this, the graphs are completely unintelligible, even our prof. gave up trying to make sense of them. The book also doesn't discuss the psychology of dying, but rather the practical aspects and biology of dying. As this class was a soc/psy class, this wasn't very helpful. If you're a prof. considering this text- please think again!"
1,tried to save money and went with them,The book binding was not in good shape as they said. It was missing pages and it fell apart as soon as I got it and started using it.
3,Filter works well except clogs quickly,"This filter seems to work well, but clogs more quickly than I'd expect. I have not used any other filters in recent years, so have no basis for comparison, but this filter seems to clog quickly when pumping seemingly clean water so that it gets hard to pump. This makes pumping a lot of work and slows it down. This filter belongs to our Scout Troop. I'll try a different filter when I buy one for myself."
5,The glory of Brazil,"Guiomar Novaes was a notable pianist . Her style was characterized for a sense of the tonal color as few pianist have been able to have it .This recording is fundamental for you , because the Grieg Concert is played with majesty and avoiding the inherent sentimentalism in which the most of the pianists fail .She knew how to get the involving sound , avoiding the excess of sensibility so typical of the romanticism movement . She turns the melody in a sugerent and impresionist portrait , giving a natural gaze not a picture museum gaze .That is why her Mendelssohn 's songs without words have no equal rivals . Try to find it .Her Chopin is OK , but Grieg is the peak of the crown . The nights are loaded of passionand fire , one of the four best versions ( among the Kapell reading with Stokowski , an incredible performing of Robert Casadesus - Mitropoulus and Artur Rubinstein)in the market .Don't miss it!"
5,Great Professional Clarinet,"The R13 Buffet Crampon is a great sounding clarinet. I have the ""Vintage"" model and it is superior to anyother clarinet I've played."
1,Yuck,"Nothing was in writing about which program was required for this disc; therefore it was not compatible with Windows 7. When I contacted the seller, they would only give me used price credit because I purchased new. But how was I supposed to know when nothing was written on the packaging. Big mistake on my part. No more purchases of discs through the Internet."
3,katadyn hiker PRO water microfilter,"I bought the water purifier for a good price, but the 'quick snaps' for the water lines don't snap in and lock the way they are supposed to"
4,4-Star trying to be a 5,"Katadyn has a history of making very good products. To say that this rises from hiker to hiker pro makes the buyer think they should spend the extra money and move up to the next level. That is not the case. The basic units are the same, you just get more junk with the pro. The extra screen on the pro is flimsy at best, removal is difficult, and I don,t expect it to last long. KISS, buy the hiker and avoid the junk. ;)"
2,Katadyn Hiker Pro MicroFilter,"I brought the Hiker Pro for a seven day Boy Scout canoe trip. The filter worked great for the first five days, then the handle broke-off. Not having a operational pump left us in a pickle and we resorted to boiling our water. I know of two other scout leaders that purchased the Hiker Pro that initially thought they had made a good investment only to have their handles break-off too. The filter was light, fast and produced clean water but its construction needs to be re-examined by the manufacturer."
2,Inlet valve popped off the second time I used it,Yep the plastic inlet valve popped right off. I've read reviews on other sites and many people have had this same issue. Some said they tried gluing it back in with moderately successful results. If you already own one of these or are planning on buying I would recommend being very gentle with it as this is far from a rugged piece of gear. I wrote to Katadyn and they said they would send me a new plastic housing.
5,Filtered hundreds of gallons over 8 years = THE filter to buy.,"My first one broke after 8 years of use and the replacement is identical if not a little better. I have seen and used others on the trail and for the most part they are a joke. Fast, durable, relatively lightweight. Too bad it doesn't have a carbon filter integrated with the bottle adapter like the PUR version (katadyn took them over) but other than that minor (and heavy) omission...it rocks, I love it, everyone uses it, buy it now, don't look back.BTW: If you want ultralightweight, go with the new water tablets. It takes an hour long soak in complete darkness but you shave a pound off your pack."
1,bottom valve broke before I got to use it camping,"If you make something for camping make it sturdy, The valve began to leak and finally just broke on this filter before I got it out of the testing phase, I thank god I wasn't out camping where I would have been in the middle of nowhere without water because this plastic valve broke. Not sturdy at all, it's a risk, don't trust this thing for serious camping."
3,Hard to pump,"After 4 days on the Appalachian Trail, this filter became very hard to pump. It worked for my entire 7 day trip, but I was worried it might fail before I could return to civilization. Other hikers on the trail recommended the MSR filter b/c of the ceramic filter it used...I dont know...I can't provide a long-term review, but I would definitely carry a spare filter if you have the Hiker Pro.PS...the water tasted great out of this filter:)"
1,Don't Count On It!,"Although I used this thing gently and only filtered about 4 gallons of water through it total, the lower nipple broke off when I removed the silicon inlet tube. I'd read other reviews where folks complained of a weakness in the design of this area, but assumed they were careless in their use of the filter. All I can say is that I was especially careful with mine and still it broke off. Now the filter is useless. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this filter. Of course, I recommend that you do not buy this, as it will leave you in a pickle some day when you need water. If you buy it anyway, please carry iodine tablets, or have some other backup water source--you'll need it."
4,"Works great!, Recommend!!","Best priced filter, was going to buy from REI, best price was here. Remember when using for the first time to rinse through to clean off the filter carbon dust! Enjoy!"
5,Water filter,This thing works great (at least I haven got sick from drinking any water filtered thru it). It's east to use and seems to be very well designed. I'm totally happy with it!
5,Thumbs up,"I have been on numberous backpacking trips from 4 mile hikes to 75 mile hikes and have taken this pump on all of them. I once used an old MSR which took forever to pump and only filtered water on the downstroke instead of both. This pump is small, compact and filters water quickly. It would take a lot to convince me to buy a different pump."
1,Housing cracked on first install of filter,"I received this filter just an hour ago. In order to make sure I understood how everything fit together, I removed the filter and the pump handle and reassembled them. Then I pumped tap water through it per the instructions to remove the carbon dust in the filter. To my surprise, I had water spurting out around the seam between the filter and the housing. Looking closer I realized that the housing had split when I tightened down the filter.To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. The lack of a positive stop when screwing in the filter made it trivial to over-tighten and crack the housing. Now if I could just manager to find ANY warranty information...."
3,Fast but somewhat complicated,"This filter works very fast, filling a 1L bottle in about a minute. However, getting to that point can be a chore. There are a lot of small parts and hoses and input versus output and caps and attachments...etc... I'll give Katadyn credit, they certainly give you a lot of parts, various attachemnts for bottles and water bags, even extra parts if you want to cut your water bag hose and add in the easy fill attachment. That's nice. But this means a lot of small, extra parts that serve to confuse, espcially if you are using it for the first few times. However, once you get it all figured out, it pumps just fine, and fills bags and bottles fast. It takes longer to set up the pump than it does to fill your bottles, but it gives a nice clean taste.Overall I'd recommend it, but learn how to set it up before you go into the wilderness. Also, take just the pieces you need, because keeping all the extra parts with the unit will either lead to confusion, or lost parts!"
2,Easily Breakable,"My friend and I have gone through 3 of these filters already. I decided to switch brands after two of the so-called hiker ""pros"" broke in my hands while filtering. They clog up too easily and although you can wash them out at home, they are almost useless in the field when they get backed up. The hose port at the bottom is cheap plastic and will easily shatter. That is the death spot on the device. My friend had the regular Katadyn Hiker, and it was basically the same product only it lasted much longer. Then, he took a nasty fall in a boulder field, and the hose port on his filter shattered too. If you plan on filtering from stagnant puddles and navigating rough terrain, look elsewhere. This filter is too delicate to take the beating."
3,Disappointed with Katadyn Filter,"Filter worked very well, had no problems. It should have had 5 Stars, however I am rating this filter with 3 Stars because it came packaged with the wrong fittings. A call to the factory indicated they were moving and could not ship the correct fittings in time to outfit the filter for an upcoming hiking trip. Finally found the correct fittings to connect a Camelback water bladder after over a week of searching and extra cost to me."
4,Good Product,This product is leagues above it's MSR counterpart. Product package could benefit from having one additional quick connect adapter; I'm hoping that one comes with the bladder I'm purchasing.
3,Up Up and Away!,"I guess if you like listening to music that reminds one of a band of floating angels hovering in the clouds, you will love this one...the harp work is very nice but I don't care much for the vocals....my clients do like it during their massage therapy sessions. It's relaxing for some people who might picture themselves floating in the atmosphere!"
4,"Different instruments, same Ben Folds","Ben Folds largely forgoes the piano for the guitar in this collection of three songs. Rockin' the Suburbs is fuelled by a strong electric guitar; One Down is a melancholic ballad that is heavily acoustic; and The Secret Life of Morgan Davis is a symphonic, trad-jazz style song merging horns, strings and a waltz rhythm. Nevertheless, one thing that remains is the comical lyrics and trademark falsetto vocals of Ben Folds. This album is a revisitation of his Naked Baby Photos days - full of swearing, jokey lyrics and most of all, full of fun."
4,Wildly Entertaining,"If, like me, you miss Douglas Adams's brand of space opera humor, then you will enjoy All the Marbles.At the opening of the book, Chandra thinks she is about as low as a human can get. She is a stranded lineman for an inter-glactic ma bell. Her partner has lost everything she owns in a card game just moments before losing his life.But Chandra soon learns that things can get so much worse as she is chased across the galaxy by hit men, buccaneers who steal party supplies, media moguls and her own employers, all searching for something that she's never heard of, but that her former partner may have won in the card game.Chandra's only salvation may lie in some old television broadcasts from Earth, a cat with a bad attitude and an archetiect who can't keep his space ship clean.All the Marbles is both hilarious and inventive."
1,Woodchuck Lure,"This product absolutely did not work. We used it for 4 weeks, at least, and caught not one single woodchuck in our humane trap. Would like another recommendation, if possible."
3,Thunder-what?,"Weinstein's first outing, ""Loxfinger,"" was so successful that he quickly followed it up with this one.Remember that the sequence of major James Bond movies released was first Dr. No, then another one, then Goldfinger. Goldfinger was the one that really caused the series to take off.The next movie out was Thunderball, the main subject of this parody. Weinstein once again scores for all the cheap laughs he can, this time even talking about circumcision for a chuckle or two.Is it as good a ""Loxfinger?"" You shouldn't ask..."
1,Does NOT Work,"Hate it waste of time -- still get just as many annoying calls as before. Save you money. It is on my business line, but still get the same calls from live person and computer generated calls."
3,Good but not for my phone system,"I have used this product before and it worked very well with my land line. In my condo, it does not work as well. I have Vtech phones and it appears they don't like it. Anyway, it is workable."
2,Not so great,"I bought an older model TZ2900 model Telezapper. It worked for a while, but now I still get 800 calls, ""Unknown"" calls, and other marketing calls. I've heard that home telephone answering systems with call blockers are available, but don't know who sells them or if they work."
5,Simple device that works.,"While it won't stop all the computer phone calls from telescum, they don't call more than twice. This seller also gave great service and even installed a new battery so all I had to do was plug it in."
3,"The product is nice, if you ever get it.","The TeleZapper works (I think) but the acquisition was a nightmare. I ordered it and received a confirming e-mail that indicated I ordered it and it was being shipped. The e-mail also had a suspected delivery date that turned out to be an absolute fabrication. I tried tracing the package and it just seemed to drop off the edge of the world. I ultimately received the device about a month later so I really can't tell you how well it works since it just recently was installed. It does not seem to work on political calls but, being political, these calls are probably being made by entities that have not called twice in the last 2 or 3 weeks and the device has not had an opportunity to scratch me from their database."
2,A pain.,"I never liked this device. For one thing, intruding calls still come through (your phone rings). For another, all it does is attempt to erase your number from the dialing computer's database (there are lots of these computers though!).In that it might have been successful, but there are two better solutions. For one, you can get ""Privacy Director"" from the phone company. Anyone who calls you from a non-caller ID enabled phone must state their name and you get to hear their recording if they choose to ring through; you can then decide to take their call or not. My own experience with that system has been wonderful, though some friends and relatives whose phones are not caller ID enabled (this problem is becoming more and more uncommon) have griped about it a bit.An even better option now is to just list your number with the ""do not call"" list mandated by the gov't. Just logon to www.donotcall.gov and list your number(s) there, and soon your phone will stop ringing during dinner."
3,I'm sick of telemarketers and I'm not going to take it anymore,"I am so sick of telemarketers calling and leaving a blank message so that I have to clear my messages all the time. I hoped the TeleZapper would help. I had one years ago and it really worked. This one has reduced the annoying calls by about 50%, so I guess I should be pleased. There was a disclaimer with the product stating it was old technology and the battery might not be good, but it has worked somewhat."
3,TeleZapper TZ 900,"It doesn't work 100% of the time. Some unwanted calls still get through. When my friends call, they say that the beeping noise is annoying. I guess I'll try the National Do Not Call Registry again.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006881R/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Love that zapping!,"I have had the TeleZapper installed for a bit over a week now and I now look forward to the phone ringing because I know that I will likely be zapping another telemarketer. I have already numerous times answered the phone only to find dead air - a sure sign that I've zapped a company. I have it set to produce its three tones; it sounds exactly as the tones you may have heard when you've reached a disconnected/out of service number. Although people don't expect to hear that tone when they call me I don't find the ""noise"" annoying; I rather enjoy it because I know what it is accomplishing. I simply warned my family and friends about the tone and all is well. I recommend this item!"
1,TeleZapper TZ900,"Mine doesn't work. Followed the directions, let it run for 18 months or so, no luck. Finally changed my phone number. New number was fine for 6 months then the dunning calls for ""Kevin"" began again. Follow up: Ah Ha! I installed a new battery (CR2032) and now it's sending its three audible tones. So, if you buy this, buy a fresh battery too! Update: Works Great! No more dunning phone calls for people I don't know! However, to tie it all together, I've also stopped answering my phone. I just respond to voice mail. No telemarketing or dunning calls for a month now! Hooray!"
1,Useless,"I received this item and it contained no instructions. I searched the net and found some rudimentary instructions. I plugged it into the phone line and while it created a beep, it did absolutley nothing to block robo calls. It didn't learn to block robo calls as I received calls from the same place twice within a few hours. Don't waste your money."
1,TeleZapper TZ 900,"I attached this product as instructed and it has not worked yet. It is supposed to stop calls that are computer generated. It has not done this for me. The calls still come through and the ""beep"" that is discribed in the manual does not occur."
4,Did as advertised and well,"We owned the old style of this and had it on our phone for about 12 monhts. We went five years without annoying phone calls from auto-dialers, and other family members were able to equally benefit from our original purchase. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks the calls started again, so it is time to replace our old one ith this one.By the way, the line noise that some mention can happen with this item can be overcome with a $2 line filter that still allows the zapper to work and clears up the line. Also, don't expect this to block direct calls from solicitors, surveyors, bill collectors, and the like, because it really does only work on auto-dialers -- but it is quite effective on them if you give it enough time and it is well worth the annoyance of having to answer or let the answering machine take the calls while each list registers your ""out of service"" number because the long-term benefit is nearly zero calls of this annoying nature for years."
1,Can not tell much difference,Got the Tele-Zapper II as a desperate attempt to reduce the junk calls we get. And yes we have been on the Do-Not-Call registry since it first came out.We continue to get a half dozen junk call a day and have had the Tele-Zapper for about three weeks.It may have worked on a few that we are not aware of (Is that you that's not calling when the phone doesn't ring?); but it does not seem like it.We suspect that the junk callers have figured out how to circumvent the Tele-Zapper's functions - but have no way to confirm this.
1,not very happy,"the product worked very well for about a week, and now everything gets past it just as if it were never there at all. I first thought that I would recoment this to everyone but in just two weeks after use I would tell everyone to not waste thier money...get caller ID and let the callers you dont want to speak with leave a message."
1,TeleZapper Zapped!,"I brought my first TeleZapper (it worked fine for quite some time)from CA to OR and after only a few phone calls my TeleZapper created an annoying, static-like buzzing whenever the line was in use which made speaking to anyone almost impossible! I figured it was simply worn out from all the use I got out of it in CA so I purchased another one. Lo and behold, the same thing occurred! I left it alone, ran some errands and came home to a loud, screeching sound from the phone! I disconnected the TeleZapper and all is well. If I had known it would happen again I would not have purchased another one. I don't know if the telemarketers have a way of zapping back but it appears so!"
3,Average,It works at zapping some calls but not as many as our original. most calls get thrue before getting zapped.
1,TeleZapper,"This product is a joke! IT DOES NOT WORK. We used it for a two week period, and it did nothing to stop telemarketing and other unwanted calls, such as 800, 866, etc. numbers. I now know why it was offered at such a deep discount - IT IS WORTHLESS. I intend to return it for a full credit.Sincerely,Don BernardoTel: 704/443-5314[...]"
1,Telezapper,"The telezapper worked great for stopping the calls from telemarketers,However I now have a loud buzzing on my phone you can barely he anyone talking on it even with the telezapped disconnected the buzzing is still there, I don't know if messed up my phone or the phone lines if I had to but it again I think I would pass"
1,not so good,I've only had the Tel-zapper for about a month and I still get just as many annoying calls. But I'll give it more time for now.
1,Mine doesn't work - No tone,"I ordered the TeleZapper thinking it would help with some of the calls we have been getting. I had one a long time ago and I knew that whenever you picked up the phone, you would hear the tone that was transmitted to the person/company/machine on the other end. This one didn't give out any tone. Not in the basic or the advanced modes. I wrote to the seller and they quickly sent out another one which was great. I would buy from them again. The problem is that the second one is just like the first. No tones and we continue to get the telemarketing calls. I didn't want to cost the seller any more money so I gave up on trying to get one that works."
1,TelezapperTZ 900,Does not stop telemarketers----can't tell any difference in the amount of messages on my answering machine. Had to buy battery when it first arrived because the one that came with the unit was dead. Do not buy this product !!!!!!
3,TeleZapper TZ900 comment,"I feel I need more time for rating this product. I am still receiving alot of ""out of area"" and ""1-800"" calls. Many have the same numbers--so I think I need more time before I can answer truthfully. I had a phone with built in telezapper previously and it would zap calls. Can you ask my opinion in a few weeks? I want to be fair in this review. I really don't think I can be fair right now. Thanks,"
1,telezapper,"I wish I could have used this product. After trying to figure out why it wouldn't work, I went online and found it had a battery inside so I went out and bought a new battery and it still didn't work so I am sending it back."
4,My mom loves hers,My mom has had this for the last year or so. She LOVES it! It has reduced her telemarketing calls drastically. It recently stopped working and she has started getting more and more calls. She can't wait to get another one.
3,Can't recieve calling card calls,"It works well to eliminate (or reduce) telemarketing calls, but if I use my calling card to call my friend who has one, I will get disconnected. A pretty big annoyance if you ask me."
3,Is not working with caller ID,"I don't know what happened. It worked fine after putting new battery in upon receipt of the item, but then 2 days ago my Caller ID would not register any incoming calls. I tried rebooting the phone, checked all connections and it still would not work. I called my service provider and they checked all their equipment and told me all was well and to reboot. Again, I did that. Then I took telezapper off and my caller ID is now working. I put the telezapper back on and my caller ID won't work. I do have a DSL filter. The telezapper does help to eliminate calls, but I also need my Caller ID. Does anyone have any comments or suggestions?"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. YOU CAN DO THIS FOR FREE!,"I researched tried this product and then one day, while surfing the web, I found the following webpage: http://www.webwithwes.com/defeat.htmThis webpage details how you can do this with an average answering machine. I promptly returned my TeleZapper and now I use the tones from this website and it works for FREE.I thought I should share this with others who may be shelling out money for this worthless device."
4,It Works (mostly),"We've noticed a significant reduction in calls in the first four weeks of use. The beep & the dead air (after a call is zapped) is a little annoying, but the beauty of it is, after a while you just don't get as many calls! So it stops being an annoyance, I guess. Companies that don't use auto-dialers still get through, but they are a tiny minority of telemarketers.Not perfect technology, but a vast improvement over three calls during dinner."
3,Think before buying,"I used to work in the telephony field, part of my job was programming dialers. The only way this could work is to ""fool"" a dialer is to broadcast the ""tri-tones"" that indicates a disconnected or out of service line.This is fine for telemarketing but many credit companies use dialers to verify phone numbers. The last thing you want if you are trying to get a new car loan or mortage is for your phone number come up ""bad""."
2,not up to snuff yet!,"I thought this would eliminate all the annoyingxcomputer generated phone calls.And it has not, plus they continue to call back multiple times!1"
2,not satisfied with product,the product arrived in good condition and with all accompanying needed instructions. but it does not perform as stated in the description. we still get computer generated calls.
1,Do-Not-Call list works better,"I purchased the TeleZapper. Imagine my surprise when we continued to receive calls from telemarketers. The Telezapper only blocks computer-made calls. It blocks all computer-made calls, even the ones we wanted. We were getting a large number of telemarketing calls not dialed by computer. We found the noise that it makes annoying as well. I returned it for my money back. With the new ""do not call"" list available at donotcall.gov, we rarely get calls from telemarketers now anyway. I can think of no reason to buy this product."
1,Zapper not for everyone,"I started to buy this item when it sold for $29. I paid $8, that's all it's worth."
3,The TeleZapper Works,"It works! I haven't spoken to a telemarketer since I started using it (3 months). It's small and easy to install. The only drawback is everytime I pick up the phone to answer or make a call, I hear the ""disconnected"" tone (kind of annoying). Also, I still get alot of telemarketing calls, but when I pick up to answer I zap them! I gave one to my Grandmother for her birthday and she's happy w/ her's too. So we'll continue to zap telemarketers!!"
1,telezapper inline TZ 900,It didn't work even at the most sensitive setting. Too bad.The product was advertised as new but was obviously used. I had paid full price for it. It wasn't wrapped in cellophane and the package was torn and dirty.I complained and the Company allowed me to return it.I had an older model before and it worked quite well. I would still like something like it if it's available. Does any one know of anything else available?
1,Don't waste your money,"It's not worthy to spend money on the device which is not upgradeable, and it turns out you keep wasting money buying next new device, I have one TeleZapper didn't work well after a while, now TZ900 then wnat's next ! Not for long you will enforce to buy TZ1000, TZ1100, it will never end !"
1,You can do this with one sentence for free,"I haven't bought one of these because if you simply say ""take me off your list"" the telemarketers are required by law to do so -- or pay a hefty fine. Since they don't want to risk being caught calling people who have asked to be taken off their list, it's easier/cheaper for them to just do it.Try it (""take me off your list"") -- it works. The calls will quickly fade away. My wife and I virtually eliminated all telemarketing calls in a few weeks -- for free. In every case the telemarketer immediately said, ""Okay, thank you"" and hung up."
2,Zapper Mania,Makes a disturbing beeping noise for all callers including those you want to ring through. Not sure it stops telemarketers since many still get through. Claims (after the sale) to only stop electronically dialed telemarketers. A toss up.
5,Telezapper Changed My Life,"This is the second one. First one may have died. Changed my life. Plugged it in and also stopped answering my phone, only checking voice mail once the ringing stops. After 60 days, no more telemarketers, no more dunning phone calls for dead beats I don't know. Now, I don't get angry when my phone rings and I don't berate unknown callers. My first one came with a dead battery, so be sure to install a new one when it comes in the mail."
3,Perfect for a FAX machine,"With prices dropping, I picked up a TeleZapper for under $10 delivered to the door, and, immediately placed it on the FAX machine. That's the end of the junk FAXes."
2,Sappy. See the French 1 instead!,"I have to agree with the people who've said they found it to be ""Hallmark"" and poorly acted/written. I struggled through it valiantly but cannot bring myself to recommend it to anyone. I DO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE FRENCH FILM (2003) ""THERESE"" (link below) starring Catherine Mouchet. A bit expensive at $35 a pop, but it's Amazing!!! Surreal at times and puzzling as you try to get yourself inside her mind. Gorgeous with a captivating performance by the lead. You will learn a lot about her spirituality, her doubts/struggles, & relationships with her sisters & Sisters.Therese"
1,Didnt like it at all,"This movie is ridiculous and a terrible protrayal of St Therese, based on the countless books I have read about her. I would never watch it again"
5,Inspiring,"This is a wonderful movie! It was well directed, the actors were well chosen and did a good job. This is a DVD worth buying. The life of Ste Therese is so inspiring...that will remind everyone what life is really all about, that ""to live is Christ to die is gain!"" This movie will encourage anyone to have a closer walk with our Lord. There is a ""desert place"" for every child of God, a little haven where Jesus is lovingly waiting...from which He is calling. Let us do as Ste Therese did and answer that call!I do not think that it is a movie only good for ""school viewing"", and if you are concerned about the narrative part, don't be, because it is just occuring from time to time (not like some movies which have so much narration that they look like a documentary). It is a great and touching movie for all ages!"
5,Wonderful Movie,This is a movie worth seeing over and over again. I have seen it multiple times and gain new insights into Therese's story each time. It is a beautiful movie about a beautiful saint whose story reaches out to all of us.
3,BORING...,"THIS MOVIE WAS ONLY O.K.AFTER READING SEVERAL GOOD REVIEWS,I RAN OUT AND BOUGHT THERESE-AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AFTER VIEWING THE MOVIE.IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE A TRULY FANTASTIC TRUE STORYRELIGIOUS MOVIE, PURCHASE ""THE SONG OF BERNADETTE"" WITHJENNIFER JONES."
2,Pretty rough,"Yeah, this film was pretty bad. I am quite interested in St. Therese and was looking forward to an English-language version of her life. Unfortunately it's as if the ""Department of Blatant Propaganda"" were funded to create this film. Everybody is a little too super-nice for my taste. Two stars for subject matter alone."
1,Typical for this director,"First, let me say that I'm a practicing Catholic but I'm also a honest one. When I saw that this was going to be directed by Leonardo Defilippis, my first reaction was uh oh. Let's put it this way, he's no Steven Spielberg. His film on John of the Cross was so corny and amatuerish as to be hysterical. He hasn't gotten much better since then."
3,misses the mark,"The ""Little Way"" was packaged into a few sound bites, in one or two scenes -- hardly sufficient time to truly delve into the spirituality of this Saint. But it was nonetheless a valiant effort at high production value."
5,The best Family movie out there,"This is a very good intro to St. Therese's life. It is one of the only current movies out there that does not need edited before the family can watch it. My 2,3,4,and 5 year olds will sit through the entire movie. The music in the movie is wonderful, and you can't buy it anywhere for less than 15.99. What a deal! It begins with her life as a child and ends at her death of 24. It shows briefly some of the trials that she faced in order to show her ""little way"" of doing things in order to become a Saint. We can all take an example from this movie on bearing our crosses, the power of family prayer, and doing the little things to work with GOD."
1,Nothing of substance,"I found this movie almost painful to sit through almost from the very beginning. The acting was amateurish and the dialog was stilted and unnatural. I have great love and respect for St. Therese of Lisieux because she was tender yet courageous, gentle yet determined, and most of all, holy in spite of intense personal trials. The movie revealed virtually none of this and made her appear superficial, almost to the point of silliness. I had really expected more depth and a more mature treatment of such a remarkable life."
1,"poorly made film, NOT recommended!","St. Therese is my favorite saint and I enjoyed reading her autobiography. However, I was extremely disappointed after watching this film. The film maker did a horrible job in things such as historical details, and I have to say, the costumes are so badly made [especially the cassocks of bishops and even the pope's], which is totally unacceptable. Moreover, actors' acting is terrible (Frankly I don't know if that could be called acting). In conclusion, the story of St. Therese itself is inspiring, but the film is utterly a disaster. Don't waste your money on this dvd, it is not worth it! The film maker and actors should have done a much better job. What a shame!"
1,Unfortunate film,"I was hoping that this would be an inspiring and beautiful film. Unfortunately it was sooo cheesy. The acting is awful. So forced and ridiculous. The girl who portrays Therese has an unmistakable mustache and it distracted me the whole time.I wish someone would make a great Therese film. She is such a wonderful saint.I'm sorry, but I just thought this was terrible."
1,Trite!,"How many ways can you say trite and simplistic. A non-Catholic, I was interested in the story, but this movie is pathetic. And trite and simplistic are the words to best describe it. The acting is amateurish at best -- don't waste your time!"
4,Poignant,"A poignant and clever film! I enjoyed it. From what I read of the reviews, I could not help but be grateful to realize this film, almost by default, ended up a real tribute to St. Therese's legacy afterall. There is so much known of this popular Saint already that expectations run high and consequently the film not satisfying for all. I was pleased and appreciative that the film captured as much as it did of her short life, relationships with family and religious sisters and her rich spirituality and her heroic death. I found Ms. Younce and Mr. Defilippis' acting particularly appealing. I highly recommend it for those who have ears to hear and eyes to see. . ."
4,High School Reunion Leads to Murder,"Ingrid Beaumont is a musician who composes scores for movies. While at her high school reunion, one of her former friends is found dead. The dead man leaves (or Ingrid thinks he leaves) her clues to his killer in the form of riddles and paintings that he created. Ingrid, who likes a challenge, is quickly off and running--trying to find out who killed her friend.I liked many things about this book. Ingrid is an out-going, open-hearted, and likeable heroine. Her dog Hitchcock adds a lot of comic notes. The love scenes between Ingrid and Ben, the veterinarian, are steamy.The plot is a bit hard to follow at times and more time is spent on flashbacks of the former high schoolers than on present-day goings-on. Even so, it's a fast-paced read with friendly characters."
3,"Nothing special, but goes down easy","Though slightly over-praised in the promotional blurbs on the front and back of the book (""A writer without peer"" seems a bit much, for example), ""Footprints in the Butter"" is nevertheless a fairly painless read and a perfectly good distraction from life's stresses. Chances are, you've seen this type of thing many times before- the quirky heroine who laces lots of observational humor into her first-person musings about the case-but that doesn't take away from the fact that this getting-to-be-threadbare formula is once again done competently here."
2,Used for the price of new?,"The product themselves were as advertised. They have nice mass and the wire will support pictures or small cards. My issue with the product was that the seller clearly sent me used clips or a store display. Some were dinged, others were dirty."
3,"A little boring toward the end, not my favorite","This book was ok, not my favorite Rollins at all. In this one the writing wasn't as annoying as it was in Amazonia, not the kind of repetitive dialogue there was in his last paperback.Ice Hunt is a thriller that is typical Rollins. And adventure mission, a secret, and of course impossible ferocious man eating beasts thrown in. I really liked Subterranean and Excavation but this one really dragged on. The first third of the book was really good, but after awhile I got tierd of ending each chapter with ""His time was running out"" and ""all went dark"" and ""He knew he would die"". That and ""The russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"" just seriously all the time.If this is going to be your first Rollins book, I recommend 'Subterranean' and 'Excavtion' first! It will give you a chance to give him a chance :)"
3,Average Thriller,"Nothing spectacular in this book, kind of between a Michael Crichton book and a Mathew Reilly book, science meets adventure. Not as good as Crichton,, but not as outlandish as a Reilly. A Russian Ice Station dating to the 1930's is discovered by a research US Navy Sub, insuing chaos begins, and there is a possible world threatening catastrophe as the ultimate outcome unless the heros stop the MADNESS. Oh, sorry I forgot about the undiscovered man eating creatures called Grendels. Combined with Delta Force commandos and Russian Leopard Corps there's plenty of action at the top of the world. But little else, if you like sensless action, pseudo science, and chaotic sequence of events, then by all means pick it up."
4,"fun read, but a bit too mushy","Since I used to live in Alaska I thoroughly enjoyed the cold climate story-telling. That brought back memories. Being ex-military I could also relate to lots of the story. I liked the exciting pace, and was never bored. Some stretches were too Harlequin romance novel for me, though. I just rolled my eyes, skipped the couple of sappy lines here and there (and most of the epilogue) and moved on. All in all, it didn't spoil it for me, but I knocked a star off for it. A little hanky-panky is fine, but when we're moving to reunite families and crying over children and squeezing tears out all over the place, it's just too much for my taste."
5,Great Read Makes Me Glad I Don't Live In The Arctic!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. James takes us on an adventure up north to the polar ice cap. Since the plot has been hashed over in previous posts, I will just go to what I loved about this story.Mr. Rollins had a great talent for taking you on a thrill ride and Ice Hunt is no exception. I like the characters and the way they interact with each other. I also like the great plot twist at the end. With his experience as a veterinarian, he adds believable ""icky bugs"" to the story too. Those vicious whale creatures are quite something.All I can say is, James, rock on! I can't wait to read Sandstorm."
5,a haunting ending.......,"Ice Hunt...what can I say except that I didn't sleep once I started it! I didn't eat much, either. I was too busy to answer my phone, turn on my computer, or even talk to my boyfriend. The story definitely never gave me a chance to be bored, or even for my interest to begin to flag. When I reached the final sentence of the book, I was truly into it....and said final sentence is still being quoted by me, repeatedly in fact, as an awesome and haunting way to end a book! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who happens to have an imagination, or even for those who do not!"
5,Awesome books,"I've read most of Rollins' books. Ice Hunt, Sandstorm, Subterranean, Amazonia, Excavation...all of which I could not put down and since I worked 12 hour night shifts with nothing to do, I usually read one book in about 3 days. Driving to the book store the nexy day to pick up another, and then another. I haven't read any more of his other books. But if you want something action packed, thrilling and suspenseful, I recommend each of these books!"
3,"good, but not a ten!","This adventure/suspense novel really takes off and moves well in the early chapters. I felt it became bogged down a bit with repetitiousness once the characters were all 'assembled' at the ice station. But all in all, a good read, it just doesn't deserve a ten. I had hopes it was going to flow better...akin to the better novels by Doug Preston. Still, I will recommend it to my adventure readers at our library where I am the director."
3,Overkill in the Arctic,"The author blasts his story through polar ice, sweeping squalls, Grendels (wait until you meet those beasts!), heartless Russians, not so innocent Americans, sub-marines, mad scientists, victimized Inuits, all at the Northern polar cap of our blue marble. Writings in Cyrillic and Inuktitut must urgently be deciphered, but the madness cannot be stopped. Many explosions later the ones who deserve to live, miraculously prevail. James Rollings has a sophisticated writing style and much knowledge about the animal kingdom due to being a veterinarian. The worst animals in his stories, however, seem to be the species human with a relentless ""kill!""-gene, mostly each other. This is my third book by this author.I think the plotting of his stories is too raw, human values not blended in to make for satisfying reading. On a normal scale the adversities presented are not endurable, but overkill!"
3,"Good book, but not his best.","After Amazonia, James Rollins became one of my all time favorite authors. This book, as Rollins usual, was filled with twists and turns. There were so many twists and turns that I had a very hard time keeping up.Though most of Rollins book is on the edge of Sci-Fi stuff, he usually could sell me into beleiving that what he was talking about could happen. In this case, I couldn't by the story line and was more than a little annoyed with the ending.It's a great read, but not Rollins best writing."
3,Disappointed,"I have read every one of James Rollins Books from his first to the last,""Sandstorm"". I have really enjoyed his writing over all. A lot of science fiction written in with the fiction, which I enjoy very much.Now, I have to say I was disappointed with this book. It is as if someone else wrote it. James stick with you typical writing.Your charachters running around without clothing in sub zero weather on the ice with no deaths due to it, please....James you know better. Were you in a hurry with this book.Anyway, I hope he keeps writing. I normally love the non stop action of your books. And Sandstorm was terrific. Excellent."
