3,ENTERTAINING BUT NOTHING NEW,"If you're a Kiss fan like me, you've probably heard many of the stories that appear in this book. It's a good read but all it did was confirm what I already knew; Simmons is intelligent, an egomaniac, has slept with thousands of women, he loves money, will do anything to make a $ off the KISS name, Ace and Peter are both dead weight...you get the picture. I'm waiting for Paul Stanley's biography."
5,Better than I ever imagined it could be,"I knew Gene went to college, so odds were this would at least be a coherent story. It was so much more than that. There were many points in the book where I laughed out loud. There were many points where I said ""Aha! so that's it!"" I'm all grown up now, so there was nothing here to break my heart or anything. I was shocked to realize how bad it got with Ace and Peter, although I suspected it was much worse than what was made public at the time. I enjoyed the story, and I'm sincerely hoping Paul does the same. You have to read this, it was terrific. It was so well done, and so fascinating, I read it through in about six hours."
4,The Gene Way of Life!,"This is Gene Simmons first book and I guess we can expect more of them as he now is 100% focused on putting out as much media/entertainment product as possible. The book basically highlights Gene's upbringing and then being the leader of KISS-- one of the most successful rock bands of all time. Although the book is not an all out tell-it-all-as-it-was, it focuses more on explaining the Gene Simmons way of life be it on music, sex, work ethics and the greatness of America and its opportunities. He gives great personal insights into his family and personal life including all the famous romances and he of course dishes the dirt on Ace & Peter for turning to the weaknesses of drugs and alcohol. A really nice read with great photos that should attract even the non-kiss fanatics!"
4,not alot of kiss,"this is the very interesting story of an israeli immigrants version of the american dream...it just so happens that he is the bass player for kiss. i was surprised at how little time gene spent on talking about kiss. the chapter on his life in israel, the one on his relationship with cher and the story of the birth of his son were great. otherwise not alot of anything new."
5,chaim...is the man with the foot long tongue,"I have always been a kiss fan since 1977, when i was 7 years old..more so I was always intrigued by Gene Simmons. The demon, a great bass player, business man, all around mama's boy. I gotta say there is alot of Humour in this book. I haven't laughed so much about someones life untill i read this book. His Mom is the best fightin' Jewish woman. Great stuff, if only ace and peter would find the time or brain cells to write their life stories..."
2,Stick to music not writing books,"I was really looking forward to getting my hands on a copy of this book. But when I finally did.. what a disappointment. I thought this book would have delighted me with tales of excess. Was I ever wrong. Right from the beginning, this book was boring! I'm a KISS fan and have been for a long time now but I think Gene should stick to writing music, not books."
3,oke but not great,"I ordered the book recently. It was a nice book, but I expected more. You think if one of the original members of kiss writes a book you get a lot of insight information that you don't know.This is not the case. The stories about what happened in kiss are stories you heard about a thousand times before.The nice stuff:the stories about Gene's private life, from growing up untill now.To conclude this review: The book to me was a bit disappointing. There are other and better books (for example Kiss en Sell) that give a lot more insight information than this one.A missed chance."
2,Slightly Disappointed,"The story was good. The writing could have been better. I have always been a KISS fan and always will be. I was disappointed in the way Gene always wrote about himself as being better than any of the other members of the band. Of cousre he chased skirts, that was to be expected, but to keep on basing Peter and Ace got a little old. To also say that Paul got a VD from an old matress did not have to be mentioned. The other thing that really bothered me was that he never mentioned that he loved the mother of his children, Shannon Tweed. Is Gene capable of loving someone other than himself? I am sure that he loves his kids and his mother beecause he made that very clear. But what about Shannon? Is she not more than just a 6ft Playmate to share his bed with? Other than that, it was a fair to good read that does read very fast. Gene could have written a much better and longer book. The KISS story will never end."
1,"Hey Gene, how about some NEW music !","Just another way for Gene to make money. I have been a Kiss fan since 1976. I was with them when it wasn't cool to be a kiss fan but i have to say this book isn't worth the price. The box set also ..., how many times has Rock and Roll all Night been on a Kiss album anyways ?"
4,KISS and Make-up,"Gene spills all the goods in one of his many books, warts and all. Well written, inclusive with many details, Gene takes us back to the beginning, the glory days and the re-incarnation of the group. Not long winded, but very thorough. A very enjoyable book."
2,So-So,"I somewhat enjoyed this book. Some of it is a little longwinded, but a interesting life he has led. It is kind of funny how bad he bashes and Ace and Peter. In that sense he is kind of cold. But on the other hand,those 2 guys put Paul and him through alot of Bulls**t.Good try Gene; but stick to playing bass and the Demon. I enjoyed reading the Makeup years 70's and 96 to Farewell tour.Though that is about it. Again I must say he does love his fans."
3,Pure and Simple Simmons,A pretty articulate read. Recommended but nothing very special. He essentially insults Peter Criss and Ace Frehley for several hundred pages.There's nothing here that most mild KISS fans wouldn't already know.
2,Two Tongues Down,"Simmons is no James Joyce, but you'd think even the least agile of wordslingers could avoid making such an outrageous life seem, well, kind of dull. At this point I'd advise Gene to trade in his thigh-high dragon boots for a pair of Reeboks -- but I remember thinking something along those lines about 20 years ago, too, so what do I know? Rock on, dude."
1,a magazine article is better than this.,"gene simmons has proven one thing THROUGHOUT this book! that he's an arrogant rocker who ""thinks"" he's still on top of the world. gene simmons is out of work and soon going to be out of fans because of this book(ironically enough most of which whom will be getting this book). from the way this book goes it's like he listened to too much of ""memory remians"" by metallica(a much better band than kiss)cause he seems to be stuck in his glory days. gene simmons or whomever REALLY wrote this book seems to REPEAT the same bloody things in each section of the book!...for hardcore kiss fans and would be kiss fans or just someone who's planning on getting this. i sugesst you look elsewhere for actual info without repeating cause you won't find it here!the writers of a magazine can do a bio better than this guy!"
3,"It's OK, but a KISS fan deserves BETTER, DAMNIT!","Ok, I bought this as soon as I grubbed the cash from my mother. Then I ran to my girlfriend's house and started reading the ultimate autobiography from my favorite KISSer of all time, Gene!!I read it all in 2 days and I was...DISAPPOINTED!!I was hoping to read more about the 4,600+ women Gene claims to have slept with. He's been bragging about these scrapbooks containing his conquests but not one page appears inside this book. NOT ONE!! C'mon, dude--if you can get top-quality babes like Cher, Star Stowe and Brooke Shields, YOU GOT TO SHARE THE WEALTH, BUDDY!!The parts about Gene's early days as a poor, yet spoiled brat were the best. His mom was pretty cute and his dad was stupid for cheating on her. He cost himself a free ride on Gene's magic carpet. Let that be a lesson to you.Anyway, I hope there's a sequel that tells more about the BABES! That's what ROCK AND ROLL is all about, right?Peace!"
3,The old ones were better,It's good but I like the old ones better. The old version was more compact and easy to hold. These ones are smoother and more bulky. This one has more features and the range is decent for the shopping mall.
1,learn the art of cheating,"They are liars and Bilkers, claiming that the level of transmission 5 miles In fact, he did not exceed 0.8 miles.When i asked them to clarify, they have said that if you do not like it send it back to us , and we do not have any device with a range of 5 mileswhat is that???Motorola FV200AA 5-Mile 2-Way Talkabout Radios - Pairbut to use it for your childen it is very nice< but remember just for 1.5 km max. in free area"
2,Purchased for a cruise vacation,We purchased these to use on a cruise ship during vacation. The range was not sufficient to be useful. If you are purchasing for this purpose suggest you look at something with more transmitting power.
1,JUNK!!!,"What a piece of junk - I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option. I bought these for my son for Christmas - he used them twice and they quit working. I called Motorola for assistance and they told me to do a couple of things (like change the batteries), none of which worked, and they weren't helpful at all. Spend a few extra bucks and get another brand and type."
3,Good for the price,"These walkie talkies work well. However, the range is very short when there are small hills around. Also, make sure you buy rechargable batteries (sold separately) because you have to change the batteries every week and a half. Very portable and durable."
3,No privacy codes,"These radios are very similar to the FV200R ones. In fact, on the surface it looks like the only difference is the fact that the FV200R are rechargeable. This is not true though; the FV200R have privacy codes. What this means is that you will only hear broadcasts by the other radio, and not all radios that are using that channel - which can be a lot at a ski resort. This feature will also extend battery life since the speaker won't be active that often.Another consideration is the transmit power, which is rated at 500mW for these radios. Typically, the range is doubled for a 4-times increase in transmit power. Some two-ways on the market use 1000mW of transmit power. This will increase your range by 50%, but will consume more battery power.You need to weigh range, battery life and privacy codes when making your decision. Motorola is a very good brand and these are very good radios - as long as you accept their shortcomings."
3,"Reception OK, but Battery Life is Bad","I find this product's reception not too bad, definately not for pro but good enough for short distance, bought it for my kid to play and find it easy to operate and quite useful in certain places. However, the battery life is very short, or maybe I don't know how to operate it. Is there a temporary off button? or power saving feature? Or do I have to take out the battery everytime I don't use it? When I left it on without using it, it last barely for 2 days. I would expect the standby time to be longer."
1,Poor Clarity,"We bought these Motorola FV200s to replace our older model Walkie-Talkies (Motorola T6220). Unfortunately, the clarity of the reception on the FV200s is horrible compared to our older model. We bought the FV200s because they take regular batteries (more convenient than rechargeable batteries when your batteries start going dead while out & about) and because of the style and the price. Unfortunately, the clarity is so poor that we constantly have to ask each other to repeat each others' transmissions. I do not recommend this model."
2,Fairly cheap,"The construction is pretty poor in my opinion. Bought these for my boys to play with and they didn't last a month. The boys are 10 and 11. Range is bad, reception is bad, battery life bad."
2,buggy,"I did manage to get the program working but it is definitely buggy. Something is terribly wrong with the audio and it has a tendency to freeze. And I have a pretty typical high-end system. Still, I find the graphics slightly more interesting than Gunship and it is decidedly less arcade-like. It is admitedly a middle-of-the-road helicopter sim with greatly simplified avionics and a flight model that drives more like a monorail than a flying machine. For some reason, an advanced flight model produced during the beta testing didn't make it in the final product but you can download it from the web for free. A patch is greatly needed here but in the long-run, this program shows promise."
1,What did I buy?,"Excellant packaging, cool screenshots, interesting concept. That's it. I bought the game. Ran home and loaded hoping to fight the villians of modern Russia. The game loaded well enough, the opening screen provided one of the best cut scenes I have ever seen. Then POOF! it spit me right back out. I was never able to get the actual game to play. My system far exceeded the minimums required, just nothing. My best advice would be to save your $30 and invest in Gunship!. KA52 unfortunately collapsed in on itself. Oh and yes, I did buy another copy and the same thing occurred. Maybe they forgot the exe file. Regardless, nothing. A waste."
2,A sim with an identity crisis.,"This sim tries really hard to be a helicopter simulation, but the emphasis has been placed more on team-based tactics than a realistic flight model. The fact that you have to fly the aircraft is more of an afterthought when it comes to mission success.This is a truly amazing aircraft in real life. This ""sim"" does not do it justice."
5,Fantastic Beginners or even Intermediate Birding Book,"This book surpassed my expectations. The commentaries on the birds are absolutely excellent and done with information and wit. I had trouble deciding between some other books and am so glad to have chosen this one. The one thing it doesn't have that I'd prefer, is a true picture of where the birds can be in the northern hemisphere - it doesn't show Mexico, and I wish it would. But I do have another bird book that I can look to for that. Because of how well written the information is, I actually sat down and read most of the book the day I received it. Wonderful."
5,Great Lens for the price,"I'm an amateur photographer, so sorry if my technical specs are just babble to you. But this is such a great lens. The only downside is it's manual focus, but that's what you get with an older lens. It has SUCH an amazing DOF. It's perfect for portraits and creates bokeh.well worth the money!"
2,"Bull, you could not use this book to make anything.","It should be titled: How you could make home electricity from wind, water, sunshine, if we had given you some plans.The author does a good job of covering the theory behind wind and the electrical conversion that is necessary to use the power in a home, but little effort is given to actually tell you how to build anything. He goes as far as to say; almost any motor can be used as a generator, but then does not actually suggest this is what you should do. I think we all know how a generator works,, what we want are plans for a generator that works well and that we can build."
5,Brushes all over where you're hurting<happy & soothing,this will pick you up when you're down and carry you around for a while. Also rejuvenate and just make you happy to listen!! With a real message!
4,This Album is Great. Good as Any of his Others,Tech brings it as hard and fast on this album as you've ever heard from him. Probably my favorite release by him.[...][...]
4,Misery Loves Kompany,"Very nice!! I Love Tech N9nes Music/art!! I've even started to like K.O.D. now that I've had it for awhile, it is Growing on me!! Guess that is all I got to say about that. I also have had and hope to keep having Really good experience with Amazon!!"
1,not enough tech n9ne,"I'm a huge tech n9ne fan and I was SO excited for this cd to come out. Then... the cd arrived. Tech n9ne is the kind of rapper that just can't do a cameo simply because he makes the other rappers in the song sound like chumps. Sadly, in comparison to tech, the other artists on this cd are lackluster. I'd leave this one on the shelf."
4,Odd,"Odd. Very odd. A duck that thinks it's a cat and a little girl who tries to convince the duck that it's a... well, a duck. Cute."
5,durable!,i took this to the beach after a year of having it up in my back yard and it literally with stood being upright on the balcony of our condo during hurricane like conditions!! no joke! only thing was afterward my angelic little 2 1/2 year old nephews wanted to rough house in and around it and ended up ripping the screen side.. but it was a great little tent!
5,"Great price, grreat product","Goji berries are hard to beat as small power packed vitamin/anti oxident packages. Since most all goji berries come from China, it is a scary product to order. So, finding certified organic berries help releive some of the concerns."
3,not for eveyone.,"girlfriend hated them but i didnt mind them too much, a little more bitter than i imagined, with a earthy taste but worth the benefits i guess. tried to put them in the fridge, that made them too hard, left them in the car one day and they tasted a little better warm, kinda gooey. def a conversation peice when toting them around with you it seems eveyone asks about them. a couple of them tasted moldy, but very minor, iguess that comes with them being sun dried with no preseratives"
4,"Good deal n Fresh, but not the best taste compared to other brands","Item came fresh and quick from the company the supplies them. However I've had a lot of goji berries and these aren't my favorite, but it was a great deal!"
5,Tasty berries!,"These supposedly have some of the highest levels of antioxidants of any food, which is why I bought them. But I really like the taste too. It's not too far off from a cross between a tomato and a strawberry, but a very little bit bitter at times.Overall they taste great, though some kids might not like them due to the slight bitterness.Edit: A few of these berries have a bit of mold on them. I would reduce my ranking by 1 star if I could."
1,Caution - Mold infested Berries,"Order with CAUTION, while all organic foods have some issues with shelf life, these goji berries were more than 30% spotted with black spots of mold. Picking through these berries to discard the bad ones is a slow and tedious JOB. They cannot be returned and you are taking a chance of wasting your money."
1,Gojis are good but not from Navitas,"The Goji is no doubt a 'superfood' and I've been having them for a long time and so may have become a goji connoisseur. The last time i bought these from Navitas and they just weren't good. They didn't taste good, very dry and worst of all they had a lot of fungus/yeast growing in them. Usually all dried fruit will have some yeast on them but these had just a lot of it, to the point that it made me sick despite of throwing away the ones that had turned black due to it.I gave a bag to my boss since i wanted him to try the goji, which he had previously liked, but had to take it back from him for the reason.Navitas is perhaps a good company and gojis are not made in a factory, but so is a lot of other packaged food and the seller needs to QC the product they sell.Long live the Goji!"
2,"A little hard, was hoping for raisin consistency, and after taste of plastic bag","I tried these becuase they were bragged about on the dr. oz show. They are okay, expensive. I was hoping they'd be moist, like a cranberry or raisin, but instead they are hard little dried pieces of fruit filled with seeds. I probably wont order these again, let alone finish this bag. But when I felt like eating candy, this was a good alternative."
2,Don't care for it.,Did not seem to help anything and was not very tasty to my tastes. Don't know what else you could have done to it bu t try to improve.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! Berries were moldy!!,I was looking forward to getting these berries for the health benefits but was so disapointed when I opened the bag and discovered a lot of the berries were moldy. I thought I could pick through but the moldy ones out numbered the good ones and was unable to return.
5,Love Goji,I love the freshness of the product of goji berries. I use straight from the package in smoothies or for baking I will soak in a little water to soften up and use the juice.
5,Eye candy,I have glaucoma and I live on this stuff. My doctor thinks its my medication that is keeping the pressure off. I forget to take the meds so often that it has to be the gogi berries.
1,Not very a good taste,This berry is gross! It even made me sick! I would not advise any one to buy this item.
4,Gogi berries,"Well, Amazon asked for a review of the gogi berries and what can you say? They are gogi berries. The product arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition. They taste the same as other gogi berries that I have had and since gogi berries have a reputation for making you happy, perhaps they are just as effective, too. Not a bad deal for the money."
2,Tibetian Goji Berries,"Did not have enough experience yet to confirm health benefits of the berrries. Eating berries 1 to three tea spoons daily do not seem to have any side affects. The beneficial effects of the berries, if any, remain to be seen."
2,Taste Ok but boy its fattening,You know i read also about the health benefits of Goji berries and I tell you the consumer is being hood winked. I dont disbute the antioxidant potential of the berry but it is extremely fattening. Per 1 oz of berries you intake 100 calories versus only 16 for blueberries. Now the SOB's out there selling the plant and berry dont tell you that do they? Man you cant trust anything...no wonder they are not popular despite the cancer causing potential id rather have a chocolate bar for that amount of calories...lol
2,Declining quality,I've been a subscriber for three shipments and the most recent shipment of two bags was substantially worse than the previous shipments. Many of the berries are black and look rotten and many are sticky and clumped together. Very disappointing versus the previous shipments. I noticed a few other people have gotten rotten berries as well. Perhaps a rise in popularity is hurting quality.
4,Pretty Good Tasting,These taste pretty good and are extremely good for you.I have been very pleased with them.Highly recommended.
4,Good for you food.,All I read about goji is wonderful but you have to get past the taste. It has an earthy taste that eaten alone might not be very palatable. Mixed in your oatmeal or yogurt would be ok. I have a hard time making myself eat this however.
4,Just what I desired,This fills my desire to add Goji berries to my Nutribullet shakes in order to increase the nutritional content. I would order again.
1,These goji berries not recommended,"Unfortunately I did not read all the 1-star ratings on this product prior to purchasing. I had similar experiences with this Navitas product having black spots and mold. Some of the berries were extremely dried out but nothing to be concerned about because it is dried fruit. I have read articles stating that eating too much of this at one time can cause gastrointestinal issues. Yes, I experienced that but do not fault Navitas. I am disappointed with black spots and mold because it was on about 1/3 of the berries. I do fault Navitas for that. I decided to throw away the remaining amount instead of picking out the good berries because mold spores can spread and did not want to get sick. When the local Whole Foods had goji berries in the bulk department, I did not see any of the mold or black spots. I will look at other brands as recommended by other reviewers."
4,authentic tobetan Goji Berries.,The berries arrived in a sealed bag. They were fresh dried and tasty. There was no problem during the purchase and the package was delivered in a timely manner. I feel that the company is honest and has good quality products.MJ Rings
1,Navitas: worst goji berries I've ever had,"Goji berries CAN be very tasty and enjoyable, however this is not how I would describe Navitas goji berries.I bought a bag once, from Amazon, and found the berries to be nearly rock hard and absolutely dry. The only good part about it was that they sorta tasted ok after chewing on them a while.If you want really, really good goji berries get Heaven Mountain brand.They cost twice as much as these, but these aren't really worth anything, in my opinion.These are the best and well worth the price:Bija Heaven Mountain Goji Berries 8-OuncesDo it right or don't do it!"
1,"It's too wet, bad quality","I usually buy it, before it was fine. But this time, the berry is very very wet and all the berries are wet to together and some have very bad taste. Seems they don't maintain their good quality any more."
5,Happy Berries,Don't eat the berries before going to bed as they will keep you awake and give you energy. That's why we put it into our smoothie in the morning.
4,live healthy,"I put the Goji berries into my hot steel cut oat cereal to soften them a little bit. The knowledge of having something totally unprocessed makes it even more appealing. If you never had them, they taste like a combination of raisins and cranberries."
1,AWFUL-Moldy and poor quality,"This was my first experience with goji berries so I was excited to try them. I actually spit them out they were so bad. Tasteless except for a moldy/salty taste! Thinking that maybe this is how they are supposed to taste, I asked a coworker about them. He had a bag and let me try his...they taste NOTHING like what I got. HIs actually had a flavor that was berry like. I looked at the product I received closer and can see mold growing on the berries. Also the berries in the bag are mostly just hacked up pieces-not a lot of whole berries. I will steer clear of Navitas brand from now on!"
2,Not very juicy.,The berries you can buy in Whole Foods are much better but they are also more expensive. These are fine for mixing in with cereal but not too great to eat on their own.
5,Delicious,THese have an unusual flavor that we love. We put them in protein shakes and add them to our nut mixes. They are a family favorite.
4,Fast shipping and fresh,"I can't speak on the benefits of Goji Berries just yet as I've only started taking them for a few weeks now with my shake.But these seem to be good quality at a good price, I received them very quickly and they are fresh and the packaging keeps them fresh."
3,Don't digest well,"This is my first brand of goji berries, so I don't know if it's the berry or Navitas (which I generally like for other things, chia, etc), but these dry little suckers don't digest very well. Even if I put them in tea to rehydrate them, they always end up coming out in full form, pardon the mental image. Will be trying another brand to compare."
2,Still on the fence with this item...,"I KNOW they say these are a super food. I KNOW they're supposed to be crazy good for you. But so far- no matter what I do or try them with... they just taste like funny beef jerky to me. I even LIKE beef jerky, but man... I can't wrap my mind around the taste of these.I've not given up on them yet... and if I find the magic recipe, I will CERTAINLY revise my review.Please read this knowing this is the only brand of these I've tried. I plan to purchase an additional type and see if there's a difference, or if this is one of the very, very few foods in the world I just don't like."
3,ok,"another reviewer posted about worms and leaves....thankfully we did not experience the worms part but we did find a number of smaller dehydrated portions of the leaves in the bags, although this is not the end of the world it would be nice if they could do a little better job cleaning it out.On to the Berries, they have been quite a bit better than 2 other name brand types we have tried as well as the bulk types from the health food store. The plastic bag seems to work better than the other brands that have used a metallic type bag which in turn gave the other brands of berries a metallic taste like I would imagine aluminum foil tasting. The fact that these did not taste that way has kept them in our cupboard!"
4,"Goji berries, huh?","This is my first time trying goji berries, so unfortunately I can't speak for the quality of this product compared to others. I can say that the product arrived fast, well-packaged, and that all the berries are bright orange with no sign of mold/spots/nastiness so far. That's probably a good sign. ;)I'm not really wow-ed by these, though. I mean, they're little dried orange berries. Not a lot of flavor, especially when pre-soaked. They're aight, I guess. I might experiment with a couple other brands to gain perspective, but maybe some things aren't meant to be dried out and shipped halfway around the world.No complaints with the condition or quality of the product itself, though."
3,Inconsistent quality,"The quality of berries inconsistent. Last package I got had almost half of the berries that were smaller size and moldy inside!!! The package before that had better ones, with only a few affected by mold. Disappointed in quality!!!"
3,Goji berries,"If I liked the taste, I would have probably given 4 stars. Shipping was fast and berries were fresh. But plain, couldnt stand the taste of them. Sorry guys, these were, just not for me. But my dogs love em!! :)"
2,To dry and crunchy and little flavor,"Tibet authentic are much better, in my opinion. They are moist and chewey like raisins, but more dense and flavorful. These are very dry and crunchy and have very little flavor. A little bit of a cardboard taste."
2,Not the same Goji Berries,"I have orderd these before and have given the a 5 star rating. Before this order I read some reviews that were not very good, but decided to try 1 pound just to see. Well, these are barely two star, still eating them but are sticky in the bag, my guess not completely dry, smell good so feel safe to eat. Still sold on Goji berries but will try another brand.Very Disapointed Goji Consumer"
1,Defective Product,"I am sad to say that I ordered these berries from Amazon and when the first shipment came they were rotten. The berries were all stuck together, very soft, sprouting and moldy.I called Amazon who then sent out a new batch. The next batch was also rotten, more so than the first. Amazon was great about giving me a refund - but it still leaves me without berries."
2,These Goji Berries Tastes Like Dusty Old Paper,"I just received my goji berries. They taste awful and ""old."" Not good. They taste like cardboard. And I think the berries have been collecting dust in some storage bin somewhere in China. The only redeeming factor may possibly be that I can at least use some of the seeds of the berries and plant them. Maybe not though, since these berries seem to be old and dusty.What I got was crap. Maybe I'm the exception. Though other people had a similar experience from past reviews.Be Warned!"
5,My Vegan Daughter Loves Them!,My vegan daughter loves goji berries and these Navitas Naturals fit the bill perfectly! They are packaged well for storage. They are priced better than at health stores and we are now ordering them consistently!! Very healthy and nutritious!
2,16 oz pack berries are discolored,I'm a big fan of Navitas and goji berries but this product (16 oz pack)has been a really bad experience. The berries are discolored and sticky and taste different too- I tried twice and then was forced to cancel my subscription. Somehow the 8oz packs I get from other stores -same brand are much better so I'm going back to other stores even though amazon was most convenient :(
2,Dry out easily.,"The taste is ""different"" but with the nutrition I was willing to give it a try. I mistakenly kept the berries in the same package, sealing with the seal provided on the package. All of the berries were as hard as a rock in a few days. I measured and added water to reconstitute them and for muffins and they were fine. But not for salads or eating like raisins. I recommend that you package in an air-tight container."
3,Conflicts with blood pressure & diabetes medicine,After receiving item talked to doctor before taking and he said not to take them as they conflict with blood pressure medicine and will conflict with diabetes medicine.Went to Amazon to get return authorization and it is non returnable so stuck with them and they will end up in landfill.Check with doctor before ordering.
2,These were terribly dry and crunchy.,"I just received my first shipment (I did Subscribe & Save on this item) about 15 minutes ago. I immediately opened the package and then the bag--being very excited to try these out. To my great frustration and dismay, these berries are nowhere near being ""soft"" or ""chewy"". They are dry and crunchy. They taste o.k. I didn't notice any ""off"" flavor or smell, but they are just dry and fairly tasteless. Very disappointed."
2,dry tasteless disapointment,"Goji Berries are supposed to be tart little wonderberries.These were dry tasteless disappointments. They didn't rehydrate well and became mushy tasteless disappointments.In the future, I am going to pay the extra $3 and buy them from my local health food store because I imagine they will be fresher and better. Would be hard not to be."
3,Not a fan,"Won't be re-ordering. Not a fan of the taste. They are drier than a raisin or dried cranberry. The flavor is almost like a cranberry meets raisin, but dry.I keep offering them to people, to get rid of them. No one would take 2nds.I tried mixing them in my Greek yogurt. They'd soften up a bit, but the flavor was still ""meh""."
2,:(,"I'd never tried goji berries, but a good friend told me that they're great for the skin, plus they are a great source for vitamins...but, oh my....they're bitter it makes it pretty hard to eat them!"
5,Excellent book,Excellent book. The description on the books condition was very accurate. Arrived on time and I have begun reading the massive volume. Very excellent subject matter and depth of information
1,Unavailable,"I got the necklace that matches these earrings two years ago and wanted the matching earrings, but for two years they have been unavailable. Would not have gotten the necklace if I had known I would never be able to get the earrings to complete the set. Very disappointed."
5,Lovely and well-made,"Although a little smaller than I thought they would be, these earings are beautifully made and easy to wear. I get compliments on them every time."
4,Fine remaster sound,"If you have a good home sound system, then this cd will sound just like you are at a disco. I was blown away by Doris Jones' No Way Out after being sequed from previous track. Never heard the tune before and it became a thrilling ride. Tracks #12-14 form a great mix. Not sure if the other Cds in the series sound as good as this for quality. A great sound of dance music, all non-stop. Very infectious and uplifting.A good testament to the often criticized sound of disco genre."
4,Who Loves You,"I purchased the Album primarily because I wanted just one song which made it pricey. Because it was an import,I was happy to get it because I-Tunes doesn't have imports"
4,Good- but not as good as his mid-1980s albums.,"Kashif was among the best R&B producers/singers/songwriters of the 1980s and this comeback album has echoes of his Arista albums such as 1984's ""Send Me Your Love"" and 1985's ""Condition Of The Heart"" but it's definitely not as good as the two above-mentioned albums."
4,He's back with a great soulful production,"Great soulful production. '... you down' are my favorits! Listening to this recording reminds me to the good old days of Kashif. For all people who love good midtempo soul. A must for all former Kashif fans! But only four stars, because the recording and booklet could be better."
2,Great fun...bad quality,I received my first xbox for my 12th birthday. I loved it! It was extremely fun had great graphics and a very good game selection. Now the bad part. After only six weeks my xbox disc tray would not come out. I finaly had to pry it open to get my game out of the system. I took it back to the store that day and got it exchanged. Now my new xbox worked for about a year and it started giving me trouble with the disc tray again it also only read some of my discs it always said disc may be dirty or scratched unable to read. But I handle my games very carefully and always store them in there cases. Overall it is a fun game system just didn't last me. I also took this xbox back to the store with all the games and bought a PS2. I had my PS2 for over a year now and no problems. I strongly suggest the PS2 over the Xbox
4,Great system...but...,"Yes, the Xbox has to be the best video game system I have ever bought. I own, also, a GameCube, me being a big Mario fan (Sierously, who isnt?). I've had my Xbox for, oh, two years. But recently, it has died. I'm not sure what went wrong. The cords are fine. I've even bought replacement cords, but it just wont come to life. I was thinking of buying an Xbox 360, until I read all the bad reviews. Apperently, the 360 has some kinks in it. So, I plan on buying another Xbox. If I were you, I would purchase an Xbox, not a 360.Ups:-Great graphics.-Sound = awesome.-Game genre is awesome!-No need for ""memory cards"".-You can use the consol as a DVD player, and a music player!Downs:-Controllers are a bit bulkish.-A bit faulty.Obviously, more ups than downs!"
1,They broke it and they won't fix it...,I have enjoyed my XBox for a couple of years... But I've been insanely busy for the last six months and have not used it. Today I logged into XBox live for Madden 2005 and it automatically downloaded the new rosters. I proceeded to play a game online when the XBox locked up just after the half.I rebooted it and Madden wouldn't play anymore. Then nothing would play. Now the XBox won't boot. It appears to have a corrupted hard drive and they want $80 plus shipping to fix it.I have never _ever_ seen such a complete disregard for proper customer service. I will not be buying a Microsoft product again. They just flushed over $500 spent on this XBox and accessories down the drain.
5,BEST SYSTEM I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!,"I can't believe I waited all these years just to get an XBOX, I was so sure the ps2 would please all my gaming needs but I WAS SO SO SO SO WRONG! While playing HALO for the first time I was just blown away and what I couldn't believe was that this game is more then 4 years old and it's still so damn good!So we can only dream how much better HALO 2 will be when it's released Nov. 2nd 2004I'm also enjoying such games like FABLE and NINJA GAIDEN. This system is a little bigger then the PS2 and a little heavier also but... WHO CARES! This thing pulls out amazing graphics and sound which is great! There is so much more the XBOX can do, I no longer play on my PS2 because the XBOX takes up all the gaming attention I have when it comes to gaming.I LOVE THIS SYSTEM SO I CAN'T WAIT WHEN XBOX 2 COMES OUT!"
3,"Close 2nd in the console wars, for good reason","I'm not going to lie to you, i'm not an Xbox fan. Its really the software that sells the hardware, and if you're really into shooters, racing games, and online play then xbox is the system for you. It has little else however.I play a variety of games, and ps2 has the best rpgs (with the exception of KOTOR), the best platformers like Jak and Sly Cooper, and is the only system brave enough to try games like Ico, Katamari Damacy, or Ape Escape.i'll be the first to admit that Xbox has the best online support, and the best graphics, but thats not all i look for. Halo is still the best reason to own an Xbox.the controller is about as comfortable in your hands as a cinderblock, and twice as heavy. though not QUITE as bad as the dreamcast controller *shudder*."
5,Quick Question,Hey wat would u suggest for me to price my console at i got two controllers one of which mad catzThe games ill give away with it areFable lost chaptersSims 2Fuzion FrenzyAnd King Kongand maybe a couple moreall of which are in great conditionemail me atpdrollinger130@hotmail.comthanks again
2,4 year cycle.,Microsft lost 4 billion dollars on the XBOX project and is apparently ending support. Nvidia already stopped shipments of their chip for XBOX production. A 3 1/2 year cycle is pretty short for a system and are abandoning everyone who purchased/purchases a XBOX.Will the XBOX 360 have a 3 year cycle when the Playstaion 3 embarasses it.Hope not. We might see the XBOX 420 in 3 more years. Save your money.
1,Microsoft you sneaking stink heads....,I guess xbox is ok. I know a lot of you are like drooling over it but Im not anymore.The goods-Graphics are nice-halos fun-online play-Is very fun wit friendsThe bads-very small selection of games-graphics are no better (some games are terrible!)-Sound is no better-Is very bulky and delicate-Defective ones were reliesed the whole first year-selling a 100 dollar machine for 300 (now is 150)-your just buying a cpu so whats the big deal about xbox live?-xbox live charges an arm and a leg.just get internet access-controllers are friggen huge and annoying. The small ones are to spendy-stuck playing the same old games over and over and OVER again-constantly screwing up on me tooWell I rest my case. Xbox sucks. Its good for a few things and thats it. dont blow your money.
1,I am entirely dissapointed,"After investing large sums of money into my computer, to make it compatible with all games, i see things like this and wanna puke. people order an x box, or a gamecube or a ps2 and call themselves gamers? ha! the truth is my pc doesnt have a single part that costs LESS than an x box. if you want to talk about good graphics, spending 150 dollars on a system isnt going to do it. if youve seen one of your friends with an x box and think that it has good graphics, by all means buy one. but if you want something better, and have some money to spare, i recommend you either:a. go to alienware.com and order one of their ""extreme gaming systems"" for between 1000 and 3.5 thousand dollars, b. buy all the parts for a computer and build it yourself, i recommend this because you can save money if you install everything yourself.im betting amazon has a guide to building a computer, so look for it."
2,This things so-so,"My dad wants to buy XBox for me, but I don't really want to. He says there are very good graphics on it, but I don't really care about graphics. I care how fun the games are. Yes, Halo2 is very fun and popular and its for XBox, but I don't enjoy those kinds of games. You might like this XBox, but my opinion is not to try."
4,I LOVE XBOX!,"Hello,I bought this XBox today, and boy people where right when they said it was thebest game console!!!*Xbox is the fastest one out there!*You can play DVD's too!!!*Very clear, When the people talk it souds great!!!*VERY easy to plug in.*Controls are nice and comfy. And the buttons work great!!!*A wide selection of games!!!*You can play agenst other players on the web!!!*You get a ~FREE~ isuee of the offical X box Magizine!!----------------------------------------------------------------That is all I can say!!!! Now on to the complaints;*Exteremly HEVEY!!*And to play XBOX live with other players; you have to pay 20 dollars a month.*To play DVDs you must have a movie play-back kit.*Selected games that say ""XBOX LIVE"" you can play online.----------------------------------------------------------------So you should ge the Xbox HANDS DOWN.Later."
4,Xbox is what I live for!,"This game system is great! It has fabulous handling and PS2 eats Xbox's dust. This game system is great. Everything about it is great, so I guess I don't have to explain it."
1,Xbox core console USM,I ordered this product over a month ago and never received it in the mail from the company. My six year old was running to the mail box daily to see that once again it has never came. I contacted the company without a response of course. I would suggest no one order from this company in the future.Christine
4,The XBOX,"I have had an XBOX for over a year and I like it quite well. The graphix are the bestAs for the person who said that the X-Box doesn't play burnt DVDs as well, X-BOX is designed not to play burnt DVDs at all. It is an attempt to crack down on pirating. The XBOX scans for a copyright layer and if it doesn't find one it won't play a DVD. You can hack into it though so that it will(be careful this voids the warranty) Im sure there is a website out there that will walk you through the process."
2,A little disappointed,"We purchased an xbox when it first came out (...). It was great, wonderful graphics, large assortment of games are now available. DVD's worked great. We had no problems for awhile. But just recently we tried to play a game and recieved an error message. I called customer service and they stated that I needed to have it repaired (...). It would almost be cheaper to buy a brand new one. Apparently this has happened a lot. They stated that 2-3 years of playing the xbox was actually a good life span for the console. I thought that it should have lasted longer."
3,Not Reliable,"I have to say the Xbox is the better of the 3 major systems out there. Only after owning it for less than a year it is already having some major problems. I will not turn on sometimes or eject. I have to hit the power button repeatedly. If that doesn't work then I have manually remove the disks. I feel this is a good buy, but only buy it with an extended warranty. Microsoft only offers a 3 month warranty. Hope this helps."
5,I'm in love with my XBOX,"I just bought an XBox the other day finally. I've played the system before, I love it. I also own the PS2 and the Game Cube systems. I love the system because of all the great games it has, also the smooth graphics WAY better then the other two systems. If theres anyone out there who doesn't own a gaming system do yourself a favor and get an XBOX."
4,Good but big,I don't have an xbox but i have played a lot with my friends. its a great system but i do have a problem with the controller. Its very big and at certain times i have trouble with the buttons. I own a ps2 and a gamecube. However which ever system you choose there is no wrong. I'm gonna name the system's good qualities and bad.GAMECUBEit's got great graphics. just behind xbox.best controllerportable.all the classic games.doesn't have a lot of games.need to buy memory chipPLAY STATION 2lots of games.best system if you like action games.can play dvd'sbad graphics.need to buy memory chipsX BOXBest graphics.don't need to buy memory chips.worst controllerdvd player.can play musicdoesn't have the best games except for Halo
1,YuckBox,"I already own a PS2 and Gamecube. I finally decided to purchase a XBOX recently to play HALO 2. I never realized how big and ugly this was until I placed it in my living room. It just looks out of place next to my sleek Sony TV, DVD-R, and slimline PS2.Not only that... HALO 2 sucks .I also heard Microsoft is abandoning the XBOX when they release the unexciting XBOX 1.5 (360)"
4,PS2 better all the way.,"Okay people,listen up.Xbox is a good system and all,and has a built in memory saver(whataever its called)think of the size and memory.The things like a MONSTER.It takes up alot of room.And the memory on it is not portable ! So that does not allow you to take it to your friends house."
5,xbox rules and ps2 sucks.,thank you microsoft for the most brilliant game conosle on the market! screw sonY!Xbox pros:everythingcons:a bit bulkyPlaystation2 Pros:nothingcons:everything
3,"So, so so so","The only reason i bought my x-box was to play fable and jade empire, and i cant realy find any other games that interst me yet well not to mention halo. The best feature is probably the hard drive saving music and playing it during a game.So i say so so so so"
3,"Though good, not balanced, and not the best.","The xbox is good, but not the best console. The xbox does not have a well-balanced series of game genres. The xbox mearely specializes in first person shooters, and while first person shooters are great, some people want more, and the xbox can't give you more. To be honest, Halo is the only reason the Xbox survives. You don;t have to take my word but PS2 is the way to go, it has a great series of game genres."
2,so so,If you like rpg's and games with depth like me this system is not for you. If you like lots and lots of sports games then its perfect. The only decent games X-box has to offer are ones that are also licensed by playstation. Better off sticking with playstation.
3,The best conslol ever,"This is the best. It can play DVDs and you don't have to buy a memory card, it already comes with one. I have the best games and the graphics are really good! It has the best games and it could be played online. You can get Xbox live and play with other people with Xbox live."
3,xbox an ok system,"xbox is a pretty good system. Not my favorite though. I'v played the gamecube which is awsome, the ps2 and the xbox. Its controller is huge!!!!. Its got like 20 buttons on it!! If you are going to by a video game system think about getting the gamecube or the ps2 first. yeah xbox has halo and halo2 but the game is not that good!! it got boring after 2 hours. Its better than most but that's mainly why everyone gets an x box. because of Halo. sure its got great graphics but the gamecubes are like just as good! and every one complains that you need to buy a memory chip for the gamecube and ps2 but if you have a gamecube just by the x4 memory card. I don't even have another memory card and i've been playing my gamecube for over a year and i still havn't had to change my memory card."
2,Not as Good as PS2,"Tried playing this for a week straight...played Halo 2...Top Spin, Ghost Recon 2...The games are good...but Halo has no custom control available..have to deal w/ what they give you...the hardware itself...(controllers) feel bulky and cheap...plus you have to PAY for XBOX live...To play online w/ PS2 is FREE!! Top Spin was the most fun...good all around game....but coming from PS2 is not worth it...Need more triggers on the Xbox controller...plus the system it is so BIG and Heavy...not as portable...plus Halo 2 is really SLOW!! Feel like I am an Old Grandpa playing in the game...especially coming from fast-paced great games like Timesplitters 2...wasn't worth my $200+ for console/xbox live/& games...Halo isn't all it's hyped up to be...can't wait form Timesplitter Future Perfect! And I can play it online for free!!"
1,Common sense,"I am not a kid, just didnt want to sign up. OK, lets get started with saying I like MIcrosoft and even the x-box is nice (I own one). So why do I hate it, the games that make the system. Without the games the system is nothing. Unless you love Halo and cannot live without it, what other game is there. Sure, there are many shooting games, in fact, almost all of the games for x-box are shooting. Wheres the racing, I love racing and there are about 4 titles out to choose. Even Gamecube (which I hate) has more selection. I admit I am a Sony fan, but not a fanatic. The PS2 has worst graphics, but better games. Besides, most games made for x-box are out for PC. As I already mentioned, games make a system, that x-box lacks and PS2 has. I have just one thing left to say- WITHOUT HALO, WHERE WOULD THE X-BOX BE, WHAT WOULD YOU PLAY?"
2,think before you buy,The x box is GREAT!!!! I LOVED IT . It has great graphics. It has a lot of games but do not play it too long or it will overheat. There are lots of choices for kids. You might not want to buy it because some of the e games have violence in them.
2,maybe not that bad...,I'm returning my xbox for a ds and gba because I'm bored of it and It can set on fire. So don't buy it.
1,I'm not a fanboy but..,"this is reeking with ""Cheep PS2 copy"" all over it. Games come in only four catgories: Shooting, Racing, Sports, and Movie Games. I don't know who in there right mind would buy this? You'd have to really love those genres. Get a PS2 or GC."
1,Pshhh.... not what I expected,Xbox's are not to good at all. Theres a few cool games so what? Ps2 is much better! So just get a Ps2.. Hey it doesn't cost 70 dollers for the net play thing!So....PS2 is better
2,What is so good about it?,"Ok all microsoft wants to do is make money. So they start copying games from Ps2 which gives microsoft a bad reputation of not being creative AT ALL. Now before all you xbox fans jump up and spout ""BUT XBOX HAS THE BEST GRAPHICS! Well guys if you want to see some great graphics put the joystick down and go outside for a walk. That's where the real graphics are. So if you're going to buy a video game system, think about buying a Gamecube or a Ps2. I hope this was helpful."
1,Microsoft must die!!,"I'm 15 and I can not tell you how pissed off i am at microsoft xbox. Why can't they think of there own game titles???? Now xbox is making GTAsan andreas for xbox!! All microsoft cares about is making money. So they think xbox will be more succesful with san andreas. And they will. But the ""respect"" belongs to Sony. Though i do not have a clue why sony sold their best game to xbox. Xbox had also done this with the grand theft auto double pack. And Max payne. If sony hadn't sold all those games to xbox, xbox would be down in the dirt where it should be unless you wanted to pay $180 just to play Halo. Halo is the only game title for xbox that is really succesful. The next generation game systems should be Gamecube and Ps2. If you want a good honest system that cares about making decent products, I'll tell you one thing, DON'T BUY XBOX!!!!!!"
5,Come on people,"Ok I own an Xbox, a PS2, and I used to own a Gamecube, I've been a gamer my whole life, so I've got a pretty good idea about what I'm talking about. Ninety percent of the bad reviews I've read on the here are by KIDS! They rate the Xbox one star because they aren't developed enough to play it! The Xbox is an amazing console, and I don't care about graphics or popularity or any such crap like Sony/Nintendo fanboys or most hardcore gamers. I guess I'm what you'd call a casual gamer and the Xbox is perfect for that and hardcore gamers as well! I'm not going to comment on the 360, but I highly suggest the original Xbox. Get some good games, like Battlefront II, KOTOR II, Farcry, Splinter Cell, Halo, Episode Three, and Fable. But AVOID GENERIC CONTROLLERS AT ALL COSTS! If you need a second controller I strongly suggest you buy another Microsoft controller because every single generic controller I've bought, for both PS2 and Xbox, has broken. Didn't have that problem with Gamecube though..."
3,Not enough games.,"The xbox is an average system. The graphics are very good, better than the ps2 and gamecube. The problem is it doesn't have any variety of games. All of them are shooting games and most of them aren't even that good except for halo. and beating the same game over and over is no fun."
3,"Great system, lousy longevity","We bought the X-box at a toy store last Xmas (one year ago). It was on constantly, being played, and for DVD watching. My kids loved the games available for them on it: Spongebob, The Simpsons, Star Wars, Race Cars, etc.However, about 10 months after its use began, it started acting strangely. A red light started flashing, alternating with the green light, and it stopped reading a couple of the games, and some DVDs. My husband went online to find out what the problem was -- many of his friends had the X-box, too, and *their* boxes started dying a year after purchase, also.It seems there's a problem with the motherboard, or chip, inside the game box, and it's a common problem.Edited to add: Since I wrote this review, we went and bought a new one -- apparently the problem with the insides has been dealt with by the manufacturer, and is no longer an issue. However, if THIS one dies on us, too, X-box can say ""bye bye"""
4,The best system out there!,"What can I say other than this is better than PS2 and the rest. The only thing that knocks it down one star is there are less games for it than the PS2. Microsoft does, however, have games Playstation 2 will never have."
5,This game was awsome,The first time I played this game I couldn't put the controller down for hours. I loved this game. I was so interested in what was happening next I couldn't stop. This game was the best game until halo 2 of corse. When I got the special gun I blasted the covenants butts halfway to h**l.
1,freakin stupid!!!,"okay,i recently got this system for my birthday and in two measly days. It MALFUNCTIONS AN BREAKS!!!! i hate this system and will never buy one again"
1,dont waste your money,i have 1 and sure you can play dvds on it but thats why their are dvd players so it can play cds big deal thats why there are cd players or I pods the games suck the wwe games suck for xbox the games seem good the 1st time you get but its flat out boaring the key word is the xbox and its games suck like halo 2 once you beat it it gets boaring save your money an use it for therapy youll need it after this
2,I love my XBOX!!!!!!!!!,My xbox is so fun i just love it so much my favorit game for it is lego star wars
1,Waist of money,This is the worst game system alive!! Even Gamecube is better than this piece of crap. The games on this game are the worst. the only good game to buy on this system is Halo and Halo 2. The other games could be found on Playstation 2 or even Gamecube. Personaly i like gamecube becuse it has the same games as Playstation 2 and Xbox pluse it has games only found on gamecube. Over all This system sucks and the games are bad too.
1,eer ok...,"most of u people are complain about ps2 players being jealous and putting u xbox players down, part of it is true i mean if the memory is stored INSIDE xbox how the heck do u take ur char or data to some1s house to battle with them on thier xbox?"
5,The BEST ever...so far..,"I wont repeat what has been said, but I will say that XBOX is the best system I've ever owned. Nothing can top XBOX live, which is an additon to the system (through monthly subscription) that allows you to connect via a ""high speed internet"" connection to servers and play agaisnt other people with XBOX! I remember the days of nintendo, the NES, and to go from that to playing a racing game with 8 other people on a headset is simply awesome. Enjoy"
1,Xxbox has a problem playing games,I have an Xbox and a PS2 I recently bought a game on my Xbox and every time I try to play it get this message that says there is with the disc your using it may be dirty or damaged but the disc doesent have any scratches on it because its brand new so I tried to cleaning it and when i tried to play the game again the same message came up and the message keeps on comming up I'v tried cleaning the game and I even got this special disc thing thats soposed to clean the laser lens and its not only that game pretty much all my games freeze while Im playing the same message keeps on poppin up so get PS2 instead Xbox sucks
4,PS2 Better...,"People if u are thinking about getting XBOX, reconsider. I have PS2 and XBOX. Yeah maybe XBOX has more features but PS2 is the system to get. PS2 has more games u can't get on XBOX. plus your XBOX will tire it self out and die within 1 year. U can have PS2 as long has u want as long as u take care of it. SO ALWAYS GET PS2."
1,RIPPED OFF,"Xbox Core Console USMAfter buying brand new cords, this system will not boot, never have seen the xbox logo, only a RED FLASHING RING OF DEATH. I was ripped off"
5,A Marvelous Game Console From Microsoft,"The Xbox has very good performance and great graphics given that it is a so-called ""low end PC"". It has ports for up to 4 controllers, an Ethernet port for TCP/IP connectivity, and an internal hard drive to store game data.The controller seems to be a bit big and bulky but is not too difficult to work with.The on-screen menus are fanciful and quite pretty.Unlike the PS2, DVD playback requires the optional DVD remote control kit. There doesn't seem to be expansion ports on the system except for the ones on the controllers."
1,Noncompatability,I have owned these games before. For some reason they are not compatable with my current operating system. I gave them to my brother and they work fine on his pc.
2,"not ""new""","This book was listed as ""new."" But has marks on it and did not come with the OWL access code that a new book should have. If I didn't want the OWL, I would have paid less for a used book."
2,Amateur Hour,"I guess I figured that if someone was thinking of taking their dog camping, they themselves probably know a thing or two about camping already. I mean, do people really just take up camping once they get a dog? Because that's how a lot of this information reads. Beginner stuff: the difference between car camping and backpacking. Things to carry in a first-aid kit (human and dog). Oh, and you'll need to carry in or purify all your water. If all this stuff is news to you, then you'll find this book a boon. I liked the lists in the back (supply companies for things like a pet first-aid kit, that kind of thing). The drawings are strictly sixth-grade, the photographs amateur. The whole thing reminds me of a high school project."
5,Annete shares.,"Filmed several years ago (before MS began talking an obvious toll on her health), Annette shares her rise to stardom with excerpts from the MMC and later. One of the few opportunities of seeing her in later years."
5,An intricate mystery with memorable charecters,"In Black Lily: Have No Mercy III, homicide detectives Joe Warner and Eddy Konklin investigate the sudden disappearance of Richard Alan Eckhard, the mayor of Mt. Pride, Colorado. A man of wealth and prestige, there are questions that must be answered. Is the mayor the victim of foul play or did he disappear for reasons of his own -- and if so, what would they be? Finding out if the mayor is dead or alive is the top Missing Person's assignment for these dedicated cops. Author Kam Ruble has once again deftly woven an intricate mystery with memorable charecters, nice attention to background details, unexpected plot twists, and an even more unexpected ending. Also very highly recommended are Ruble's two early mystery novels featuring homicide detectives Warner and Konklin: Have No Mercy and Black Rosebud: Have No Mercy II."
2,Ironic,"Gene Simmons writes about about being cheap and buying only what you need.This advice from a man who has built a career on promoting and selling KISS merchandise, which no one really needs.If KISS fans had taken Gene's advice, Gene would not be wealthy.Ironic."
4,"Money, just money","Gene is a money gruber much like myself, he makes good points of common sense. this is a good book to lite a fire under your...well, he's harsh and you can only make money his was is if your as harsh and ruthless as him."
5,A big kick in the ass for any self-promoting businessman!,"I never thought Gene Simmons was such an ace businessman! He's really amazing! His approach to business is totally self-made and every of his many ideas seem to became a source of revenue, sooner or later, one way or the other. No matters if he got no experience in a domain, despite that, he will go for it and try it, all by himself! Minimizing every cost possible in order to make the largest part of profit he can. I love his life philosophy: he's cheap and proud of it, he's a shark and proud of it, he's dedicated 24 hours by day to his work, and most of all, he is totally drug-free. A live example of the American dream! And an example to emulate for every businessman in the making! A must-read book for everyone!Plus, I share the exact same philosophy about women and life! They just want your money and life is all about the money!"
1,Not for the Kindle...,"I bought this 'electronic version' of the book for my Kindle, and that was my first mistake. The book is poorly formatted for the Kindle and the words are all run together, repeated, and split between pages and pages of pictures that also are poorly formatted for the Kindle. What a waste of money! That being said, I tried to read the book anywhat, looking for the words of wisdom and humor that I have seen from Simmons in the past -- again, what a waste of money! This is by far the worst book I've read in a long time, and the whole premise that Simmons is some sort of financial 'god' is a joke. His stock has dropped with me, although he still has my 8 bucks and I've got a useless ebook."
4,Good financial and practical advice.,"My feeling at first was that Mr. Simmons was out to sell a ""product."" Most times, as with anything, the more the hype, the worse the product. However, this is not so with this particular book.One needs to put aside all the banter about the sex and KISS to appreciate the practical advice given by Mr. Simmons. He's straight to the point and he makes sense. It isn't popular to voice what millions already know but only whisper to the closest of associates. Finally, someone with enough chutzpah to say it like it is.You want good common sense advice, get this book. You may be popular. However, I rather be able to have a better quality of life than be popular and broke."
1,Gene tells us to save our MONEY,"Gene is pretty saying the same thing over and over through out this book....SAVE YOUR MONEY. I can't help but think that Gene's sole motivation for forming KISS (besides girls) was to make MONEY.After reading this book, I felt like a sucker who bought KISS stuff when I a teenager. Myself and many other fans basically made him rich.His neanderthal approach to women demonstrates his ignorancy and black and white views.Thank GOD (oops sorry Gene, I should said Thank MONEY) I checked out this book from the library. Hey wait a minute....I SAVED MONEY BY NOT BUYING THIS BOOK. Wow, Gene maybe you do have a point."
5,Great Seller,Would do business again. Received in condition described and received in a timely manner.
4,What can I say?,"I got this book because it was an autographed edition. I really didn't think it would be of any interest. I was wrong! He gives a lot of good advice in personal finances. Some of it should be common sense, but it's amazing how quickly we forget the basics! I don't agree with everything he says, but I've already used some of his advice and it's working for me! What more can I say?"
2,NO BASIS IN REALITY,"Good advice but most of it not realistic. Example; Work 7 days a week and don't take vacations till you're wealthy. If you do take vacations, you're loser. I think that's kinda harsh, but maybe that's the point. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars I s as usual, Gene was entertaining and did make some good points."
5,Sex Money Kiss,"Great book! Found a lot interesting facts about Gene Simmons. Which is what I was looking for! Doing a psychology paper on Gene Simmon's personality, it's the perfect book for this!"
3,"Autographed edition, eh?","I recently purchased his autographed ""Sex Money Kiss"" book and his signature looks different from other signatures he's done. Makes you wonder."
4,"Love him or hate him, at least he's honest","Interesting read. Gene's style is pretty straightforward and breezy. Yes, his ego is out of control and I don't really need to know when the first time he grabbed Shannon's (...) was, but if you're a Kiss fan, you'll love it."
3,Enjoyed his first book better.,"I keep reading that poeple read it and finish it in one sitting. Well, I can't finish it. I got a bit bored with it quite frankly.I love Gene and I love Kiss. With this, I am just flicking through and not really getting attached to it. The stories of Kiss first hand will always be the attraction to me but the advise stuff is old hat. It seems a bit simplistic but maybe thats what works. I would endorse his first book which was really about Kiss and some great stories, this is okay but not stirring."
5,Organic Wisodm,"I'm a Nashvillian, and love watching Jeff Poppen on our local PBS show 'Tennessee Crossroads'. I'm reading this book an essay at a time, out of order. I'm enjoying the down-to-earth writing style, it is very similar to what what he presents in his segments on the show: concise information on organic farming with wisdom and humor shining through. Much of the technical info about farming is applicable to my tiny urban organic garden, and I'm finding the anecdotes thoroughly pleasing. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes lit in the tradition of Wendell Berry or Michael Pollan, or if you like Ken Kesey's semi-autobiographical collection of essays Demon Box."
1,Boring,"I was looking foreward to getting this book for my new employees for inspiration. Unfortunatlly I was not inspired, just bored- I will not pass this one on. Sorry...."
3,Offers some,"My 1st impression with the opening remix of NOW was, this will be a great album. The remixed beggining of the 1st track is excellent and The Great Satan is a good follow up. Other good songs are the remixes of jesus built my hotrod and Bad Blood. Other than those 4 songs the CD doesent offer much. Just previously released songs and live versions."
4,Saintly Author writes about a wonderful God.,"It irks me to have to give any book about lord Krishna just 4 stars. Especially when written with such skill and poetry by a saintly and wonderful devotee. I am forced to drop a star simply because the author has fallen into the Diety is utimately formless trap. Yet again another aspirant who hasn't yet grasped the unbecomming nature of absolute reality. (Ie does not change, devolve or evolve). God in the supernal realms did not become form, nor were the eternal realms constructed or created.Nevermind I am sure that the Author Devi Vanamali will achieve the highest spiritual heights, her devotion to the wonderful primal Lord Krishna is clear and unmistakable. There can be no fault in such a person, they are already liberated."
3,Interesting but not more,"This books allows us to discover Ayrton Senna through the eyes of people who knew him closely. The thing that disappointed me is that some of the key people in his life weren't a part of this book (Adrienne, his family members) and that some of the anecdotes were too superficial and we would have liked getting in a little deeper in the matter. Overall, an interesting series of ""short stories""."
4,As good as those in school,"The quality and condition of the book is equivalent to those used in my school district. Wear and tear, typical for a book used by sixth graders for more than 5 years."
2,What are you saying?,"The material in this concert is some of Jackie's most successful and popular. Unfortunately, the production values of the recording are abysmal. The performance is 5 stars. Unfortunately, you will have a difficult time appreciating this.Save your money and buy ""Broadway"", ""Trilogy"" or the the other DVD""s which boast outstanding production values."
5,Almost watching him live!,"This show was recorded twenty years ago, but as I watched it, the material, delivery, and humor seemed fresh and cogent and not dated at all. Seems a throw back might appear out of date and unfunny given the new comics and their dirty and blue material. But Mr. Mason reminds us how timeless and funny he can be with a clean show. I have watched it three times already so that I would not miss any of his comments. His accent and delivery are too regional and fast for my adopted southern home. But I finally got it all."
5,Skinny Bitch,"This book was a page turner and definitely witty. The writers had a clever and off-the-wall way to get their important points across. I recommend that everyone reads it who is interested in eating healthier, purer and saving the environment and a few animals."
1,Misleading!,"I bought this book yesterday and read it and I have to say, what a disappointment. The book starts off funny - I like the swearing and no-nonsense approach. Until about chapter 3, things are all good - explaining the ills of junk food, soda, coffee, but then SLAM!! You get into the middle of the book and it's all about the evils of eating beef and chicken, fish have feelings, graphic details of how animals are tortured. I didn't buy a book to learn about animal processing plants and farms, I bought a book to learn about a no-nonsense approach to losing weight. This is vegan propoganda and it should have been placed with other vegan books. There should be a disclaimer that this is a graphic and disturbing book."
1,Total garbage,"Not worth a cent. I am sure that every vendor mentioned in this book paid to be in it. The profanity is the only funny part. The ""scientific"" evidence is ridiculous. These two ""skinny bitches"" need to eat some ""organic"" STEAK for a change, do some weight training and stop being loud mouth idiots."
1,hated it!,"I was on board with this book (in audio form) initially, then they got into meat, and were really zealots about it! I have nothing against Vegan folks, to each their own, but this book was disguised as a funny get real book about weight loss, that turned into some kind of podium for why we must all be Vegan! Shame on you for not being more upfront about what this book is really about."
1,Unscientific piece of drivel.,"The dictionary defines ""drivel"" in the following manner:1) to let saliva flow from one's mouth; drool; slobber2) to speak in a silly or stupid manner.Perfect description for this book!The authors apparently feel that they are ""hip"" or ""cool"" because they are capable of swearing and insulting people; last time I checked, these were talents that do not even require a high school degree.The authors use the most amazingly unscientific ""sources"" to ""support"" their bizarre claims. For example, they quote a claim made by some plaintiff in a lawsuit as a source! Don't be fooled by these self-proclaimed ""_itches"". You'll learn more scientific information by listening in at your local hair salon."
2,"Vegan book, not a diet book","This book will get your attention. But it won't help you lose any weight - unless, of course, you are ready to become vegan overnight and eat all the ""nice organic"" cereals and breads blessed by the authors. I found the vulgar language to be offensive and their advice completely ridiculous. Yes, there is a case to be made for not consuming mass-produced meat products, but their arguments are weak and try to overplay the shock value of it all. Save your money if you are interested in the diet part of the ""skinny bitch""."
1,The only kindle book I've ever returned,"Other reviews have already covered my complaints, I just wanted to add my 1-star. This book is so full of incorrect bad science, myths, and eating-disorder style statements that it is hard to take any part of it seriously. This is the sort of thing vegetarians/vegans don't need- like another reviewer said, I'd hate for this to be someone's first introduction to veganism, because it is strident, preachy, and full of misinformation."
5,LOVE IT,"You will either love it and hate it.The good points: Food and how it is made, what they do to animals, soft drinks,I could go on and on its a great book.The bad points: I like not like the use of the F word over and over."
1,Just Another Vegan Acting Holier-Than-Though,"This book masquerades as mass-market but is nothing more than a vegan's ranting about the evils of meat and dairy products. I felt deceived and for the first time in my life, threw the book in the trash bin. I came home from work, found the package on my doorstep, read it for about two hours, then threw it in the garbage. I felt like the authors were trying to shove their belief system down my throat."
2,"Funny book, but thats it","This book is hilarious. It really is. However, it isn't going to help you lose any weight unless you're ready to commit to living the vegan lifestyle. This plan would be super for anyone who lives next door to a natural foods store and who has no children or job and can committ 100% of their time to living naturally. Unrealistic as far as I am concerned, but still a funny read."
1,Worst book ever,"I hate this book. It is the worst book ever. I bought it for $2.00 at Goodwill, and it wasn't even worth that. I agree with the other reviews that it is full of erroneous information, encourages people to think less of themselves and of their food. I am no prude, and am not offended by language, but it is just silly and immature to berate people and think it's cute to curse so much in a book. I teach school, and this is worse than something my sixth graders would write--about as interesting and informative. Yawn."
1,Misleading!,"Unless you're prepared to go 100% vegan, this book is not for you. While I can respect vegans, I don't think it is THE only way to be a ""skinny bitch."" Since reading the book, I've watched how much of what I eat (not WHAT I eat), while exercising regularly, and have lost 16 pounds to date. I wish I had read some reviews before buying this book - it was a waste of money"
2,It's just a clever title - no new information here!,"The short review: this book is mostly about becoming a vegan, or at least a vegetarian. The condensed advice: give up all products that contain sugar, high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, or chemicals of any kind; give up ALL meat & meat products including fish, eggs, dairy, jello; eat lots of organic fruits & vegetables; drink lots of water; exercise. The whole selling factor in this book is in the title, not the information provided!"
2,"Again, did PETA pay them?",I am only halfway through this book but felt strong enough about what I was reading to come write my own review.I thought the book started off good and informative as someone else had said but then turned me off after they got on a soap box about animal cruelty as the basis for being a vegan. If they had convinced me not to eat meat on the basis of it is truely bad for you...okay. But the minute they started ranting about the way animals are killed for like 8 chapters I realized it was a plug for PETA and made me disregard the credibility of the whole book.Have you ever watched how animals kill each other in the wild? Next thing we know you will be writing a book on segregating animals in Yellowstone National Park.
3,This is a great approach...,"I have read parts of this book and I have come to the conclusion that the approach of this ""diet"" book is spot on. It's target audience is not for the committed vegan, but for a culture that wouldn't necessarily consider veganism as a diet or a way of life. I think the mission behind this book is to get people to realize eating meat and unnatural food isn't so great by communicating to those who want to be ""skinny."" It's for those who judge a book by it's cover, and I don't think that's such a bad thing to do since these authors are trying to be relatable and educational to an audience that would probably shun a typical vegan diet book."
4,Good Motivator to Eat Better and Lose Weight,"I enjoyed this book. It made me giggle, it motivated me to lose weight and made for excellent bathroom reading.The science / evidence / reasons for statements made were often a little bit off, occasionally downright incorrect. Despite this, I feel this book was one of the most important motivators for me this year to start working out, eating healthy food and living a more eco-conscious lifestyle.The authors strongly advocate veganism for health and ecological reasons. I am not a vegetarian, but have cut down the amount of meat that I eat in a week dramatically this year without feeling any major loss. I'm sure the authors would be proud.Excellent companion: Skinny Bitch in the Kitch. Good ""alternates"" to many comfort foods we americans tend to enjoy, good meal ideas, good recipes in general."
1,Not worth purchasing,I was very disappointed in this book. Really wish I had not wasted my money. I maybe could have stood the intentional gutter language if the information had been worth it.
1,horrified!,books on dieting should be filled with FACTS and positive helpful information. this is just a book that is Bulgar and offensive.
2,"Mostly common sense mixed with unfounded ""facts""","I've been a vegetarian for awhile and this book had been recommended to me several times so I decided to check it out. Some of the ideas are just common sense- avoid sugar, artificial foods, and white flour and have your diet mainly consist of veggies, fruits, and legumes. The rest of the book contains unfounded facts about the meat and dairy industry and insults the readers for ever consuming those products. It acts as if the ONLY way to lose weight is by becoming vegan and buying a bunch of those overpriced vegan foods. I eat non-organic eggs and dairy regularly and have lost 30 lbs by taking care of myself and using common sense. I rarely buy soy products and spend probably only $100-150/month total on my groceries.If you need someone to slap you across the face to realize common sense, read it. If you have it on your own and don't want to be bullied into becoming vegan, pass."
3,"Read this, and you, too, can be a skinny foul-mouthed, rough-talking Bitch","After reading the first chapter or so of the book, I turned to Amazon and ordered SEVERAL copies for ""my girls""; daughter, daughter-in-laws, niece, sister, etc.Since completing the book, we have all commented on our displeasure with the exceptional amount of crude and scatological language used!--which unfortunately prohibits us from sharing it with our pre-and young teens .While Skinny Bitch is not in the league of works by Michael Pollan, it does offer and reinforce information we NEED to know and acknowledge about our dietary behavior. We welcome the attention given any publications on this topic.[We appreciated the warning before the recitation of the unholy treatment of our animals...truly heartbreaking!]"
5,Great Read! Great Information!,"This book was wonderful! I was a vegetarian prior to reading the book, now I'm a vegan and loving it! I couldn't put the book down, it's very blunt, honest, and humorous...the way your girlfriend would talk to you. Two of my co-workers have read the book since I finished it and they loved it. I've never been able to read a diet book before, but this is not a diet book, it's just informative."
1,awful,"I didn't want to give this book ANY stars. Reading it (and I have to admit, I didn't make it very far) made me feel dirty. This book ferociously insults its readers at every opportunity. The authors may have thought they were being clever, but really, how hard is it to be nasty?This is a yucky, mean-spirited book written by women I hope I never meet."
1,Huge waste of money...terribly political,I just wanted an informative and possibly fun book on weight loss and dieting. This wasn't it. I read the first couple chapters and then began to skim the rest of the way through it...then threw it in the garbage and became angry that they got even a dime of my money! A couple of loud mouths who espouse things that are so completely wrong and unhealthy. They should have been more up front that this was all about veganism and full of far left wing political idealology even bashing former presidents. It's a diet book for crying out loud! You girls aren't smart enough to take on politics...or nutrition apparently.
1,Really...,"If anyone can take a diet book that pushes colonics as being an important part of being healthy, need to really start doing some research."
1,Do not waste your money,"This book is useless. It is not a book about changing quality and quantity of food to lose weight, but rather an advertisement for PETA and Vegan incorporated. There is really no guidance on portion control, excercise, or lifestyle. It simply tells you over and over again with a lot of offensive language to be an organic eating vegan. That's all, nothing more. I am surprised this is a bestseller and can only think it is because people think they are going to get a great book, but upon finishing it do as I did, throw it in the trash. I have zero respect for these women that think the only way to be skinny is to be vegan, and the only way to get their message across is to be vulgar and crude. I know plenty of vegans that are overwieght and very unhealthy, just as there are many nonvegans that are thin and healthy. I have never written a review of a book before, but couldn't bear the thought that other people would spend money on this junk."
1,Awful misguided hawking for pro-vegan crowd,"It starts off with a good premise: eating better. I definitely agree about their ideas on artificial sweeteners, but that's where I draw the line. Is the food industry the best it could be? Of course not. But that doesn't mean I'm going to go completely vegan because they frown at having eggs and chicken or fish instead of beef. It's the same old ""you're either with us or against us"" mentality that drives PETA to not see anything other than a narrowly black and white view of things.And on top of that they call out any detractors with foul gutter lingo that may impress some, but I didn't pick this book up to get insulted. I'm glad I got this trash from the library. Now, I'm going to do a purification ritual at the bakery."
1,A PETA agenda clothed as straight talk,"And the saddest part is that I paid for it!I don't have a problem with the ""eat more veggies and stay away from the meat"" montra, however the authors couldnt leave it at that. They had to preach the party line from the likes of Jeremy Rifkin of PETA, sorry i mean Center for science in the public interest. The authors are rude and drive an agenda.Unless you're on the ""people don't belong on this planet"" bandwagon, don't waste your money. Straight talk with an agenda is still an agenda!"
1,2 Thumbs Way Down...,"I was excited for this book because I thought it would simply state what I know to be true. That whole grains, fresh produce and low-fat meat and dairy are good for you and you need to get movin' to loose weight. I was expecting a fun spin on these ideas and maybe some new tips. Instead, the authors sadly used this book as a way to unfairly and inaccurately make the entire meat and dairy industry look terrible. Not everyone needs to be a vegan! They also included tons of made up facts on human digestion that simply aren't true. I will continue with my 3 serving of dairy, low-fat meat and veggies/fruit and whole grains. While I agree with a few things in this book, much of it is ludicrous and really shouldn't be in print."
2,This bitch is mean and wants meat-eaters to die!,"I got this for the novelty of it; I thought it might be a refreshing take on health. It relies on insulting the reader for shock factor, and that gets tired pretty fast. Some of the logic for weight loss is just common sense, so I'm sure there are probably some receptive readers out there. BEWARE-- the authors like to force horrifying stories and facts about the evil meat-eaters in this world, so if you're a meat eater and don't plan on going vegan anytime soon, this book will just leave you feeling like a fat jerk."
1,Two Cursing Genetic Freaks,"Thank God I got this at the library and didn't buy it! Book in a nutshell:1.) An ad for Whole Foods. Basically just go to Whole Foods and shop. Duh.2.) DON'T do anything fun, for God's sake!3.) Get a couple of frenemies together and have them curse at you repeatedly, you will save yourself some money.4.) Make sure the frenemies are flawless genetic freaks."
2,"Too much Eliminate things from your diet, not enough attitude","I felt mislead by the catchy title of the book and was very disappointed after I read the first chapter! It is mostly a ""WHY TO eliminate bad foods"" book rather than a mental attitude, no-holds-barred attitude adjustment book about one's diet. In the first chapter it tells you to eliminate PRACTICALLY everything from your diet, including cheese, meat, milk, coffee, soda, etc etc. It tells you to become a VEGAN, and it does not do enough psychological attitude coaching like the title thought it would."
1,First book I ever threw away,"This is the first book I ever threw away. It offended me highly. The language was completely un-neccesary, the facts questionable. I felt like I had just been bullied in the halls of high school. Don't waste your money on this book. There are many more professional books on going vegan, or on any other topic for that matter. I should have known with a title like that it would be pointless. After reading this book I went and ate a big fat bowl of Fruity Pebbles cereal and loved every sugary, artificially colored bite drowning in fat-free milk from poor tormented cows."
3,Preachy,"Granted I loved the way the book made me feel like my best friend was talking to me, I thought the girls were preachy. I mean the one of the authors of the book is just a ""know it all."" I think some of the ideas they talked about were great, but to be honest, the preachy got to me. That and to more or less to tell people you have to be a vegan to be skinny really ticked me off. Watch me be skinny and still love meat."
1,Vegan propaganda is right!,"I can't believe i wasted my money on this book. I bought it at an airport so did not research it beforehand.... I wish I had!Nowhere in the synopsis does it mention that it is a vegan book, so I was really annoyed when i got to the chapters about ''animal cruelty''.Also, the authors' attempt to shock by insulting their reader with vulgar language came off completely classless and tasteless (and I am no prude).Waste of time and money! How healthy can fake meat, eggs, milk be for you? And how can soooooo many doctors and nutritionists be wrong about the health benefits of dairy and meat? Totally skewed views and really not helpful!"
5,"What I needed to hear, not what I wanted to hear!","When I started this book I was really just looking for a diet book, and the clever title and chic illustration caught my eye. I was not a vegan, and had NO intention of becoming vegan, when I started reading, and had carefully avoided animal rights literature for quite some time. After reading this book I made a decision to completely overhaul my life, this included going vegan, getting rid of all my nasty addictions (mostly alcohol, caffeine, cheese, and sugar), leaving a bad relationship that was going on for too long, practicing yoga, etc. I have lost 35 pounds so far (and counting), I am healther, I am happier, and I feel generally amazing. I am really glad I was able to read this book before I heard what its advice entailed, I am sure if I had realized beforehand I would have walked on past and missed something really special."
2,Crude language. Not factual in some areas.,"Very crude language in it. I was offended.The tone of the book is one of them being the smart good ones and everyone else being the stupid bad guys.In the section on slaughterhouses, they say that a pig dies in one way but if that doesn't work then it dies in the hot water and then the book goes on to saw how it suffers afterwards in yet another method. If it is dead then how does it suffer? Also, there are bad people in every industry but that is no reason to put that industry out of business.Having very little protein like they said causes me to not be well due to hypoglycemia. Protein along with fruits and veggies keeps me going. I did not like the book."
1,"misleading, depressing and tiresome","here's a great strategy to utilize this book. every time you get hungry, turn to any random page, chances are good you will find gory descriptions of animal torture. read the animal torture until you're so repulsed and depressed you completely lose your appetite (and possibly your will to live.)repeat until you are as skinny and as bitchy as these two gals."
2,Who could live on this DIET?,"I do not feel this drastic of a diet plain is sustainable for most people -- for the long haul.No nicotine, no coffee, no sugar, no eggs, no meat, no dairy, no wine with sulfites, no sugar substitutes, the list of ""crap"" (as they call it) you cannot eat in this book is just endless.When soy was mentioned, I was shocked that benefits of Non-GMO soy were not touted more. Recommending soy is like walking in quicksand. The jury is still out.All in all, the authors curse like sailors and I found this to be a disappointing organic fruit and raw nuts diet that the average joe (or jane) would have an absolutely impossible time sticking to."
2,Very disappointed.,I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book. This is written from the stand point of two vegans. Obviously they are going to frame the book around their views. In my opinion they went and found the research that confirmed their beliefs and wrote a book with it. Someone could do the same thing for being a carnivore.
2,stick to the entertainment careers,"While this book was written in an entertaining...although vulgarly entertaing fashion, it wasn't about becoming ""skinny"", ie. a weight loss approach. Basically, it was about how factory farming is a bad thing. No arguments here, just not what i was committing my valuable time to reading about at the moment that i needed diet advice!It neglected to go into the underlying reasons to reject eating animal products. For instance, what if I get eggs from my own farm chickens that run free through the pasture and eat wholesome foods? Are the eggs still bad? I know lots of skinny girls that eat meat, eggs and junk food.I can see their line of logic but it's very poorly fleshed out. The guilt or disgust factor only last so long for anyone with a brain to ""think for themselves."" This book stops short of anything meaningful to take away."
3,Hilarious but be Warned: Authors Push Vegan Agenda,"I thought parts of this book were really funny if you don't take it too seriously. I will condede that some of the name-calling (in jest) could be hard to take for some who struggle with their weight. But I think you know that going in (I mean look at the title).However, I did not know ahead of time that their primary goal in writing this book was to push their vegan agenda. They talk graphically about animal treatment in the food industry as well as their perspective on the detrimental health effects of not eating a vegan diet. Since I am not vegan (nor do I have plans to become vegan), this greatly reduced the value of some parts of the book to me. It also made me feel tricked that the idea of this funny book was used as a hook to preach to me on veganism."
3,not what one would think,"The book wasn't what I had anticipated. The title is very misleading. There was some good information, but I could have done without Chapters 6-9 political rantings for a book that is basically trying to convert people to become vegan.Without going through every single example, there were a few contradictions, including the main one of not forcing this lifestyle onto others. Which is exactly what chapters 6-9 were.There are lots of quotes of other books and lots of suggested websites and processed Vegan foods to buy.And just for the record: NOT EVERY single farm is as they portray in the book.I would suggest borrowing the book."
5,Changed My Eating Habits,"I've been on the ""Skinny Bitch"" diet for over 8 months now and I feel GREAT!!! Knowledge is the biggest motivator. After reading this book, I did more research (not being one to believe everything I read--need to get my information from several sources). I was amazed at what I did not know about the meat industry, dairy industry, and sweetners.Life was blissful when I didn't know or care what I was eating. Now that I know, I'm healthier than ever. This is the easiest ""diet"" I've ever been on.Oh, and I'm discovering new foods and how to cook again!"
1,Very opinionated,"I started off by loving this book. I thought the crudeness of it all was actually quite funny and refreshing. But it wasn't long before I realised that this book is just written by one-sided, opinionated, meat-hating vegans. By all means, live the vegan life if you like. But the way they tear down the meat and dairy industry is disgusting. They say not to preach if you are going to become a vegan and yet it is EXACTLY what they are doing. I don't recommend this book to ANYONE because all it will do is create anger towards vegans.The authors sound like two very bitter and sad, angry women.I pity them."
1,"it is a COPY of the book is, ""Eat to Live.""","Great information , but sadly the autors just copy the infornmation from the Dr. Joel Fuhrman's book is, ""Eat to Live."" The Dr Joel book is one of the BEST DIET books in the market a lot more information . better buy the original book ""EAT TO LIVE """
1,"Of my 17 years buying books, this it the only one I ever returned","The first pages I read while browsing seemed interesting and maybe something motivational because I deceided to buy it. When I got home the book went downhill from there. I don't need someone throwing out a obscenity every other sentence about how bad it is to be overweight. Also these chicks say you NEED to be vegan to be skinny. Ugh , no I don't think so. They keep harping on don't eat meat but always eat the fake meat. I think it's funny because they yell at you about putting all these chemicals in your body, but hello what do they think is in that fake meat?Young girls should not all read this at all. This book is everything that is bad with soceity telling them to look a certain way. As for me I am grown and know not to listen to this garbage.Avoid this book, you will be glad you did."
1,DON'T READ IT,"This book berates women who are overweight and does not inspire the ""can-do"" attitude on needs in order to kick bad habits. In addition, the authors have no credentials which might qualify them to give advice about nutrition or dieting. It's a shame that women are taking this book seriously and that they are spending money to promote the series of cookbooks, etc. that have followed."
1,Like teenagers using curse words because they can,"I don't have much to say about this book. I threw it away after the 4th chapter when they described in detail how animals are slaughtered. Ya, that will make me loose weight, I'm going to be sick so there goes my breakfast. My main problem with this book is the stupid use of profanity. I feel like I was listening to teens trying to see how vulgar they could be. I knew there would be cursing due to the title but it just got silly after a while. At one point the author says ""it's so good it will make your pubes fall out"". What! stupid. I know this is not a wonderfully written review but just wanted to put my voice out there."
4,you'll either love it or hate it...,"While I personally loved it, I could see where some would take offense.I think the book had a lot of useful information: especially what specific foods and brands to eat (and what to avoid), definitions on those foreign ingredients on labels, and recommended reading.They probably did rant on a little much, but the more people are exposed to reading about those nasty slaughterhouses, the more there is a chance people will wake up and change.I think the authors tone was hilarious, although crude, it made me laugh out loud several times....you just have to have a sense of humor about it."
5,No sugar coating!!!!,"I always wanted to go vegetarian but nothing gave me the boost to do it........until now.This book has changed my life. I never want to eat meat again!Not only do these girls tell you like it is, they are funny and very informative. I wish I had known this information years ago.I loved the book so much, I read it twice in one weekend.Even my meat and potatos man is trying to eat alot better.Thumbs up!!"
1,probertson68,"Ok, the authors are funny but this diet is ridiculous. No dairy, no meat, no alcohol. NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Being Healthy,"I bought this book last night, and I finished it last night. I will probably end up reading it again today. Bascially everything makes sense and it is a good book. It did get a little dry in parts but the point is clear.I am now going to be a vegitarian, and take some tips from this book. Everyone should"
1,"If your interest is becoming a vegan- go nuts. If not, don't waste your time!","Page 186 of this book will say it all- This is an agenda, not an insprirational weight loss book. It's full of arm twisting vegan preaching (and seriously, I have no problem with vegans), If I wanted to read about becoming a vegan, I would! Why be so misleading?Funny at times (thanks to my own crude humor) but mostly just a waste of my time.Tisk Tisk."
1,Incredibly deceptive,"This book presents itself -- in its title, cover art, flap blurb, a quick browse -- as a book focusing on healthy eating for the busy modern woman who would like to be slim. Once purchased, and read in its entirely, it turns out to be the Anti-Meat Manifesto. I eat meat, I like to eat meat, I think there is nothing wrong with eating meat, and, as far as I know, there is no evidence that eating meat (including lean meats, poultry, and fish) in a balanced diet makes anyone fat or unhealthy.If these ladies would like to publish a book about vegetarian or vegan eating/cooking, they certainly should do so (and have). It is entirely inappropriate, however, to package it as an ordinary weight-loss book for anyone with no inkling of the political agenda waiting inside. Obnoxious and deceptive."
3,"Great read, but overdependent on soy products...","Skinny Bitch is a great read, but all of the books are overdependent on soy products as substitutions for meats, dairy, and cheeses. Many will find that they're thyroid is very sensitive to soy.... I wish there were some other options for us bitches who can't eat soy."
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"While I think a great deal of the information presented in this book is both entertaining and well-researched, I was very annoyed with the chapter on slaughter practices. I bought this book to learn about a healthier lifestyle. While I didn't really expect it to be a vegan manifesto, I can completely understand how a vegan diet can improve overall health. However, I don't think vivid, disgusting descriptions of animals being slaughtered has much to do with my overall health. I wish the authors had stuck to the point--how meat and animal products are unhealthy--rather than turning their diet/lifestyle book into a platform to expose animal cruelty."
3,3 stars for motivation only,"This book is for people who want to be a vegan. I didn't know about that when I bought this book.I have some questions after reading this book. Why can not I eat organic yogurt or kefir? Those products are very good for us. What about French and Italian people who eat cheese, drink wine, and still have a low percentage of cardiovascular diseases as a population? They are not overweight.I work with many people from India who are truly vegans. They don't eat meat substitutes. I was surprised to find fake chicken, fake groundmeat, and fake meatballs in recipes. Why do vegans have to eat something to remind them of meat?"
1,Rediculous Preachy AR b.s. Waste of a Day's Read,"When I first started reading this book I thought it was going to be great, very straight forward and something to learn from. Then I got to chapter 3 I believe maybe it was chapter 4, and it all went downhill. Preaching about animal rights and berating readers for eating meat or animal products. Its absolutely ridiculous, and a total waste of time to read.Their concept that humans have evolved and are no longer meat eaters, is obviously not true considering the fact that vegans are required to supplement for the loss of nutrients required by the body to survive.I have nothing against vegans, but this book is not what it is perceives to be about, its a clever marketing ploy to get you to read their bs about crazy animal rights activist. Even in the final credits they apologize for calling you a skinny [...] and say they don't want you to be skinny.....Spend your money elsewhere!!"
2,Deceptive but interesting,"I felt somewhat deceived when I started reading this book, No where in the summary does it actually tell you what the book is really about. Nothing at all mentioned about becoming a vegan or even a vegitarian. I did, however, find it interesting to see another side of dieting that I have never really considered. I think I will try some, but not all of the suggestions mentioned here. It was pretty disturbing to read about the animal proecsses and I actually could not even finish that chapter."
1,Crass with No Class,"This book is horrible. I stopped reading this book mid way through. I should have stopped earlier. The tone is abusive and the authors use crass language in a manner which discredits them, in my mind. I think their philosophy could have been presented in a sassy, smart way, vs. crass and low class. Wish I hadn't wasted money on it."
2,Annoying...,"This book started out annoying and ended annoying. I understand their whole image that they're trying to portray (or at least I think I do), and that's fine, but there is just way too much cussing in this book. I really couldn't stand it.That being said, I knew most of the information in this book already, but some of it was informative for me. I liked that. I like being informed without all the derogatory language though.As you can tell, the language really bothered me. Blah...The other thing that bothered me, and I'm not sure if it was a joke or not, is they go on and on about how bad it is to drink soda, how bad it is to eat junk food, artificial sweeteners are horrible, blah, blah, blah. Everyone knows that already. Duh. But then somewhere toward the end, they say something like, ""Don't blame us if you see us doing beer bongs. We're only human. It's all about balance."" Huh? Okay...I could go on and on, but bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,How about angry btich?,This book is filled with so much angst and vulagrity that I would give it zero stars if I could. They twist the truth and come across very condesending to their audience. Don't waste you money or time.
1,Horrible RIP-OFF --- Worst book --False Advertising,"This book has nothing to do with dieting or being skinny.It is a rip off of chick lit books like Bridget Jones or the Shopaholic series.This is a hardcore vegan book rudely written. One chapter is on torturing animals. Another part advances that fish feel pain, don't eat them.The very last page says it all: ""We lied, this book is not about being skinny"".Yep, but it's great cover, but all bull. Save your money or simply buy a real vegan book and give up ALL sugar, dairy, meat, fish, and still be the same weight. If I hadn't bent the cover, I'd have returned it.PS: the clever writing, isn't. Example: ""...so shocking your pubes will fall out.."" or something like it to make you not eat meat products.How witty is that?"
1,Disappointing...,"I loved the beginning of this book and found it hilarious...but then the shock-and-awe chapters began and it became tedious. I do not recommend this book unless you are willing to give up everything except for fruit, vegetables, and whole grains."
1,Misleading,"I bought this book with the hope it would give me some tips for dieting, but sadly I was wrong. I felt like this book wasn't trying to teach me how to be health and diet, but rather push an ideal of a lifestyle on me. One of the few...very few tips I got out of this book was to try yoga. Other then that, these skinny b****es are just what they say. No meat, no dairy, and no painkillers. I would never tell a friend to read this trash."
1,obsession..,"Even tough they have good points at the beginning, they got aggressive at the end. They say they we should not eat any animal product, but yet their all recipes including fake animal products..that's crazy"
1,Another diet book you can toss,"The only reason I can think of for this book to be a best seller is that it has a catchy name; couple that in the diet world where people are always searching for that miracle and there you have it. The first chapter or so has you thinking it is a refreshing book with a nononsense attitude about it. However, the foul language and writing as if all written word is fact is a put off by chapter 3. (Yes, sometimes with research but on topics very ""gray""). Some of their opinions are good ones: don't eat sugar, excercise, etc. so take the rest with a grain of salt. Losing weight or staying fit will always come down to eating properly portioned, healthy food and excercising. PERIOD"
1,Waste of money,"This book should've been titled 'Skinny Vegan Bitch'. If you want to be a vegan, read this book. I thought this was a normal dieting book not a vegan diet book. The title and back cover discription are misleading."
2,Overall Mixed feelings on authors' writing style....and some of content,"Even though I have not been able to touch meats or chicken (except seafood :)) ever since picking up this book, and picking up some healthy habits over my already pretty healthy eating style, I found the writing, while funny, to be dragging on too much. The tone would have been more effective if not overused so much in every instance. Some parts of the book were hard to read & swallow, so I am sure this was the exact intended message, and it made me aware & curious of subjects I have to research. It definitely had a huge impact on me. Did not care much about the authors disposition on politics, and the oversimplified world-is-black&white and we could have world peace if we all did yoga (Give me a break, don't they watch the news!). Overall, interesting read with some good content. Definitely overrated though."
1,Worse Than Meat Eating!,"The bulk of the book is meaningless citing of works from incredbley biased resources; the authors sound like complete robots. I had to throw the book down once the indoctrination of veganism started. Waste of time and money, and I hope women are smart enough not to fall for it."
1,Not even 1 star,"This was a horrible book. I don't know where they got their facts from but I've never heard so much bull. Seriously, these ladies are nut jobs. Just goes to show that anyone can write a book I guess."
2,not impressed,"This book was crude at best. The language was inappropriate, and the advice was given in a way that was demeaning to the reader. If you are looking for a book to inspire you and help you on your journey toward health, I would not look here. It has an all or nothing approach to. It recommends you give up everything for the sake of being thin including caffeine, sweeteners, and meat. When looking to lose weight, it is better to ease into life changes than give everything up cold turkey. The habits will not stick otherwise. Read this book with caution and take with a grain of salt."
2,It's got a great cover,"But what's inside is not what I expected. I'm glad I'd taken ""The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort"" by Erica Black to the beach the same weekend."
1,don't waste your money!,"I found the whole book to be entirely laughable. Its not about diet, its about promoting veganism. Is some of the advice good? Yes, but it is overshadowed by so much extremist ""wisdom"" and delivered with such foul language. They talk down to the reader, like we're a bunch of dim-witted Valley Girls or something. And they use only the research that supports their ideals. If all you want is a good laugh, then go ahead. If you're looking for a good, serious, sensible diet, this is not it."
1,MISLEADING,"This book does NOT cover what it advertises. This is a book about why you should be a vegetarian...it does not focus on weight loss. The same information is repeated several times about the cruelty of killing animals for meat. Also, they provide slanted information that only supports their opinions. For example, they say that carnivores are better adapted to digesting meat than humans. Well DUH. We are NOT carnivores, we are omnivores... we are not meant to have the same digestive systems as carnivores. These girls are politically trying to persuade the reader to become a vegan... their interests are not weight loss.I believe that all the good reviews listed below are provided by the authors and publisher of this book because this is just not a good book. I was not only disapointed, but was annoyed by the authors taking advantage of the readers."
1,"this is not a diet book, it is propaganda","This book has nothing to do with diets, I was really disappointed when I started reading. What I wanted was a smart, funny diet book. What I got was pissed off vegans who want a lot of people to jump on their bandwagon. Say what you are really doing ladies, it has nothing to do with diet and everything to do with your own agenda.If you want an in depth description of animal cruelty, read this book. If you want helpful suggestions on eating right, try Hungry Girl's books."
5,Book review,"This is the best book ever on eating/living right. I was not a vegetarian before I read this book, but was one a week after reading it. Not that vegetarianism is absolutely the way to go for everyone, but I found it was for me. Just read the book and you will understand. I loved the way the authors were extremely blunt in their approach and the way all of their advice was supported. They have an opinion, yet they remain objective. It was a great read and really opened my eyes to a lot of things regarding eating/living well, industrial farming, and money and government regulations go hand in hand when it comes to food in America."
3,Tough to listen to,"I got this book on a CD to play in my car. Let me warn you. If you don't like the title you will hate the language in the book. The profanity is offensive and I'm no prude. And I don't like the author calling me (the reader) a moron, an a__hole, and other vulgar terms they reserve for anyone that's ignoring the dietary guidelines they advise. Or hearing her say ""shut your fat mouth"" and many other similar and worse expletive laced remarks I won't mention here. I think a good portion of what they tell us about food in this book is valid and factual...but not all of it. You will learn that to become a skinny bitch you must not eat ANY meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, cheese, beer, most wine, all forms of sugar and soda either regular or diet. So do the math. There's not much left. The parts about animal treatment and slaughter were extremely tough to listen to. I think this book would have had much more credibility had it been written without the hard core language."
5,in your face information,"i love this book - it's in your face, tell it like it is, information - as a vegetarian, not a vegan, who has toyed with going vegan, this book slapped me in the back of my head and said most of the things i already knew in a no nonsense way - while some might be offended by this in your face method, i found it just what i needed to get my act together and get healthy"
3,Not a how-to book but food chapter is a helpful starting point.,"Despite the foul language, if you can hang in there until chapter 11 when they have 4 weeks of vegetarian menus and a food list, They'll be something you can use. I don't agree with the only fruit for breakfast. If you want to go vegan and want to make sure you are eating healthy, I recommend Becoming Vegan. Also, Vegan Cooking for One. & Neva Atlas' Vegetarian 5-Ingredient Gourmet has some great recipes in them."
1,Sad to see this on the Market,"Seriously if I were the surgeon general, I'd make it a point to have labels for books such as this that stated, ""This book can be hazardous for your health, psychologically and physiologically. Books that give inaccurate information such as this, can be especially harmful if you are 1-an adolescent with an impressionable mind 2-someone with low self esteem 3-someone with body image issues 4-someone who is addicted to quick fixes and fad diets!"" DO NOT READ THIS...OR tag it as satire!"
1,Rude and insulting book,"I am so glad I did not buy this book because rarely do I read something so hateful. I found this book on my sisters bookshelf and thought it was a novel. What a horrible, self righteous, self serving book. This book is condescending and did not enlighten me to the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. I am a healthy person and I would not use this book to lose weight if it was the last resort. Save your money. Do Not Buy. I rarely give a negative review on a book but this book shocked me."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I really dislike this book.Their language is horrible; they use as many swear words as possible for shock value. Their grammar is terrible. Did anyone edit this thing? I was incredibly turned off by the writing style and tone of the book.If you can get past the language, most of the information presented is off mark or just plain wrong. The majority of the ""scientific"" information is not backed up by citations or references.It's presented as a healthy diet book but the real motive is to convince you to become a vegan. It's a very unpalatable piece of propaganda."
1,Everything that is wrong packed into one tiny book,"As somebody who has been vegan for over 10 years I am flabbergasted at the inconsistencies, pseudoscience, misinformation and vulgar hyperbole of this book. It's a big black eye for veganism and I'm appalled such a book would co-opt veganism to make a quick buck like this. Do yourself a favor and skip this book and any other in the series these women are churning out."
1,What they said,"There's over 200 one star reviews for this book. I seriously doubt I have anything new to add other than I read through the book in the store and wouldn't even want to buy a used copy for $.01. So, I don't have much to add, but I have to write something in order to contribute to the one star category."
3,Eye opener,Opens your eyes to what they put in food products and why you can't lose weight without knowing.
2,extreme skinny bitch,ok. So first off their advice about vices is good and delivered with humor. And the advise about sugar and carbs is right on the money but then they start talking about dairy and meat. I was on board until then. This book is basically a beginners guide to veganism with allot of bad words. ALLOT.
3,skinny bitch,"Great book, good info, I have to say though, the writers goal is clearly to turn the readers into Vegetarians and Vegans. =) Its tough, but worth it."
1,Beware of the,"From an article on MSNBC:Barnouin, a former model who did most of the book's research, said she did correspondence courses with Clayton College of Natural Health, a non-accredited natural health school, which gave her a degree in holistic nutrition.So, if you Google Clayton College, the first thing you see is:[...]If you're going to choose Vegan, find a better qualified source of information."
1,You can find the same info elsewhere without the vulgar language,"Like some of the other readers, I found the language to be too unprofessional and vulgar, and more of a distraction than anything else. I found that the language made the book sound more like two college co-eds prattling on and on, and frankly, it just got on my nerves. I would never take advice from a doctor or nutitionist who used such language during a consultation, and I feel no differently about books. The book contained some good information, but it gets lost in the poor writing and bad language."
2,Not good,"I bought this book for $1.50 at the thrift store. I have always been curious about it. it reads like a copy and pasted book report. I could have written this book. It doesn't flow well at all. It should have been marketed as a vegan book, but then who would buy it?Everbody wants to get paid. Make that money ladies. It will make you think twice about eating a dead animal though."
1,Don't buy unless you plan on eating only vegan foods,"This book focuses on how meat is the anti-christ, dairy will murder you, and if it's not organic, it's crap. Personally I found this book to be a complete waste of money. The women that wrote this leave nothing out in the title. They're both skinny, and they're both bitches. That's all. The book was worthless."
1,Don't waste your time....,"I bought this book expecting it to be a humorous book on dieting perhaps get a tip or two while I read it. I was thoroughly dissappointed. This book isn't even funny or interesting....and it has no tips. Let me sum it up....go fully organic vegan, eat tofu....if you eat anything else you are poisoning your body.....please. This it provides a bunch of horror stories on how animals are treated. Its just a waste of time and it insulted my intelligence."
3,Mixed....,"I appreciate the fact that the authors act as consumer advocates and encourage readers to find out ""truths"" within food industries including the cruel treatment of animals and the blind eye of the FDA, which approves ""poisons"" like artificial sweeteners.The book however, like its authors, is misleading. Veganism may lower cholesterol and be better for the environment but it will not necessarily make a person skinny. I have eaten many amazing vegan foods that are filled with ""healthy"" fats from nuts, oils and soybutters not to mention calories from sugars. I am a healthy weight but I never lost any pounds as a vegan. I saw the authors on the Ellen Show pushing vegan cookies and basically saying that a person can eat as much as she wants because they are vegan. Yeah, sure...if you want to be a Fat B****"
1,Insane,This book is ridiculous. It insists that the only way you can get skinny is by becoming a complete vegan and never eating any sugar at all. Its nonsense.
5,Eye-opening book!,"I consider myself aware of the food system and the bad effects of certain foods, but this book went to levels I didn't even think existed! I definitely look at my eating habits differently and, while I'm currently vegetarian, I am strongly considering going vegan."
1,Misleading Title,"This book is not at all what I expected. I am sad to say I doubt I will finish reading it, it's that bad. I expected a book about nutrition and healthy lifestyle changes that in the end lead to skinny-bitchdom. What I got was a bunch of horror stories meant to terrify meat-eaters. It starts out ok. The first two chapters are interesting and made me rethink some of my ideas about what I eat. From there it took a nose dive into vegan-evangelism. I am all for veganism, its every individuals choice. I didn't expect to have the skinny bitches throw it in my face. This is one of the least helpful books I have ever read."
3,"GOOD ADVICE, HARD TO APPLY","Dear Potential Reader:The authors of this book know what they are talking about. They have done extensive research into Vegan diets, the practices of the Food & Drug Admin. and other regulatory agencies, and mondern trends in nutrition. If you follow their advice, you will drop a lot of weight and be healthy.Easier said than done. I'm a prosecutor and in and out of court all day. I rarely have time to prepare complicated vegitarian meals. In a perfect world, I would do everything they say - but most of us just can't. I will say this - they have convinced me of the horrors of artificial sweeteners and diet soda. I have stopped buying them. Also, I have basically cut out dairy - on their advice. Their arguments about the harm of these two things are too logical and articulate to ignore. I have lost 9 pounds. Susanna Shea, Memphis, Tennessee."
3,Trying to make you go Vegan.,"Here it is in a nutshell ""you are fat pig and you suck. Go vegan!"" There's some humor in it and some good advice and beyond that how can I truly review it since I haven't followed it's advice? I just really have no interest in totally cutting out sugar, milk, and meat. So I suppose I will have to go the route of becoming a ""skinny bitch"" via portion control and exercise."
3,A little too informative for my taste,"A good read no doubt took me a few hours, stomach turning details regarding meat etc.. basically tells you the way to stay skinny become vegan."
2,Disappointed,"Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library... cause it's going back today!This is what did it for me:Page 145:""Don't eat lunch until your close to ravenous.""What kind of ridiculous statement is that?I would wager that few in this country understand what ""ravenous"" truly means.Whatever dietary dogma you chose to follow, at least do it sensibly."
4,"Good info, but...","I think some people slapped down one star reviews because the book promotes veganism. It seems for some people it's all or nothing.The book was a quick read full of interesting information and yes the profane language could offend some but many people seem to find it hilarious.Take it with a grain of salt, and no, not everyone who goes vegan loses weight, not everyone who goes vegan has an eating disorder either. The title and cover are fairly misleading but things like not relying on coffee, cigarettes, and junk food to get you through the day is good, solid advice. If you're expecting an in depth how to guide to help you lose weight, you won't find it here. However, it does provide a good starting point for people who have no idea what to do or where to start.Not the best resource out there, but it's interesting, amusing, and there is some solid advice in there."
3,"good advice, but a little much","this is a great book if you are a vegan and it gives all the pros to being a vegan. It is not a lifestyle I am ready to adapt to. Since reading the book, I no longer it beef, chicken or pork. Told as it is, no nonsense."
1,Be ready for a Vegan Polemic,"This book is terrible. The title, _Skinny Bitch_ is suitable, bc if you were to follow the diectives in this book you may or may not become slender, but you will definitely become a bitch, bc you would not be able to go out anywhere without asking a million annoying questions, and boring you frineds and family with Vegan Propoganda. The coloquial style--while intended to be charming--is actually quite off-putting, and rather insulting. As a historian, I know how to formulate and support an argument, and this is not it! This book is a false adverstisement, and I am sure that the bitchy authors are laughing all the way to the bank. If feel embarassed for wasting my time and money with this dross. I am perfectly capable of being skinny by eating a moderate omnivorous diet..and so is everyone else. Don't waste your money ladies!!"
4,"Personally, I love the book!","First thing you gotta know about this book is there is a lot of profanity and this is a VEGAN diet. I did not know this when I purchase the book although I have been thinking about becoming vegetarian. They named the book Skinny Bitch for a reason and that was to sell the book. They also did not include that it was a vegetarian diet on the cover for a reason also and that was to sell the book. I personally like the book. The authors are very straight forward and like to tell you that ""If you eat crap, you are crap"". According to them, soda is liquid Satan. You have to give up a lot like coffee, sugar, soda, sweets, meat, eggs, cheese, etc. They also tell you the graphic and horrific details of what goes on in slaughter houses. If you are vegan or want to have a vegan diet, I suggest this book to you. If not, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Don't waste your money,I read one chapter of this book and got rid of it immediately. This book basically states that if you are not a VEGAN skinny bitch you cannot be healthy. The dairy chapter is full of untrue garbage about dairy farmers which completely discredits the whole book. It was hardly worth the paper to start the fire. Dont waste your money.
3,Too Harsh,"I liked the concept of the book and basically how to become a vegetarian, but I thought the language was a bit overdone, and the blatant descriptions were a little over the top. I could hardly eat anything after reading the book. If that is the intent. It worked."
3,"Honest, blatant, vegan.","If you can handle a vegan lifestyle, this book has some good info. The book is written with a very straight forward approach. Not for me, though."
2,Vulgar words mean a lack of intelligence...,"ao how can you listen to any of their advice?This book sounded so interesting. But by page 30 I was sick of their vulgar words. I felt like I was back in high school surrounded by kids who were trying to look so hip and cool using bad language.I believe when you resort to the use of certain words, you lower your intelligence by several points. So with that in mind...these two women are dumber than a bag of sand. And just as tasteless.Don't buy this book. It's useless."
1,Not what I expected,"I'm looking forward to selling (or giving away) this book. I, like many others, expected to find helpful hints but instead was greeted by a very political, pro-vegan, opinion piece. I feel like a chump for not checking it out further before I purchased this crap."
1,SKINNY BITCH,"This was a scatological diatribe against other diets, meds, and doctors.But offered very little good science. It was so de-motivating that I threw it away before the end."
2,started out good but quickly went down hill..,"The book started very good. Very true concerning health. The Aspertame chapter was very interesting and informative. However, their ranting about meat and preaching veganism was rediculas. They only give facts (anatomically and physiologically) that support their rediculas beliefs about going animal product free. Where the f do you get a masters in hollistic nutrition? If they want to publish books about nutrition, they need to do better than a ""self-taught know-it-all"" model. I could get on my nutritional soupbox, but as a nurse, they need to get some further education on nurtition before publishing a book. They also needed to start the book out by telling people to consult their doctor before starting a nutritional overhaul. Not all people are idiots concerning their body but you still have to count for the ones that just buy into anything. PEOPLE, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!!! Yes you will get skinny, but at the expense of what?"
1,Should be Skinny Bitching,"It's unfortunate that this is described as a diet and nutrition book. The authors really use it as a platform to bash the meat packing industry for cruelty to animals. They probably have some valid points but it's not worth half the book, especially when they sensationalize their point with stories about cows being violated with broom sticks. The language is a little hard to take, too. I'm not a prude but I think people with weight problems take enough abuse in general society. They don't need to buy it from someone offering to help them lose weight. It's like Dr. Phil with potty-mouth. This book is so one-sided about the vegan life style it's hard not to wonder about any other opinion. If your contemplating becoming a vegan, this book will send you over the fence. If your looking for a book about nutrition and weight loss, don't bother."
1,What a rip off!,"This book is the worst bait and switch I have ever encountered. I wish I could get my money back. Instead of the witty, interesting book I was expecting on how to look and be fabulous, this book is nothing more than a re-tread of every tired argument you've ever heard on why you should be a vegan. They even admit that they made up the clever name as a marketing ploy. If you want to hear all about how animals in the slaughter industry are mistreated or about all the bad additives in food, go right ahead and buy the book, but don't expect witty, amusing, interesting or original content. Literally the worst book I have read in a long, long time."
1,Very Stupid Book,I thought this might be a fun read. Thought it just may have some useful suggestions. I found it totally stupid. It read like talking to someone with NO social graces; who was also rude and crude. There are so many other books out there with much more to offer.
3,Skepticism,"There is NO doubt that going vegetarian/vegan will definitely be a healthier lifestyle. In consideration of how unconscious pleasure is the main focus of the American high life, I do applaud these authors for asking their readers to instead turn to conscious analysis for their dietary habits. But, asking for people to go from omnivores to straight-up herbivores is NOT happening and also HIGHLY difficult. It is an expensive and difficult lifestyle to maintain in our society's restaurants as well as our supermarkets. The diet calls for an extreme lifestyle and extremes never stick; balanced choices that we can live with will. So more than likely, people who follow Skinny Bitch for a few months will jump off the band wagon upon sight of a large, gourmet-prepared, buttery, porterhouse steak."
3,Should State that it promotes Veganism,"This book is funny and is written in a no nonsense tough love format. But nowhere in the synopsis does it state that this is a Vegan book. Many points are valid regarding sugar, artificial sweeteners, sulphites, pesticides, and hormones in meats, but the book is still misleading.Stating that healthy skinny women eat none of these things is ridiculous. Though I will continue reading this book, I feel misled and I would not have bought it had I know of the ulterior motive."
1,Total Crap Vegan Book,"I bought this book thinking I was going to get some new healthy eating tips, but a few pages into reading it, I realized it was trying to convert me into a vegan. Ugh. I was annoyed that these 2 women seemed to bash all diets not strictly vegan, saying that you can only look fabulous if you eat their impossibly strict diet.I work next door to a health food store, and let me tell you, I took a look at the health information on a (moist,delicious) vegan chocolate chip cookie. 380 calories, and 18 grams of fat in one cookie (which also tasted like hamster food. I guess this is why the authors are skinny. Who wants to eat that kind of food when even a cookie tastes like crap?).Also, fasting? Are you kidding me? I won't even go into that. Of COURSE you are going to lose weight! You are starving your body! Give me a break.Oh, and one last thing. I know a few vegans, and they are not skinny by any means. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys food."
2,Off Topic,"From the cover you think it's about how to get the body that others envy. However, with every chapter it strays further away from the title message and a self-righteous tirade about veganism. There are some good arguments, but if you haven't instantly converted just from reading a few pages then the ingredient guide and meal planner are useless.Main points of the book:1. Give up entirely all meat, all dairy, sugar, caffeine, and over-the-counter medication.2. If you don't, you are and will forever be a fat, disgusting, immoral slob."
1,Vegans way or no way,This book is nothing but Vegans bashing anyone not practicing there way of living and eating. This book was a total waste of time and money!The only reason I gave this one star is because that was the lowest rating they will allow!!!!
1,Worst book ever,"I read this book at least 2 years ago- before it was a bestseller (thanks Posh Spice) and before anyone even knew about it. It was terrible then as I am sure it is STILL terrible. I learned nothing when I read this book- except that ""I should like, TOTALLY love this TOTALLY awesome book because the authors are like TOTALLY skinny and they like TOTALLY know how to like, help me be thin cause they're sooooooo awesome.""Gag me- I like my book with a little more substance- I want to enjoy my brain cells- not lose them."
1,APPARENTLY ANYONE CAN GET A BOOK DEAL THESE DAYS,STUPIDEST BOOK I EVER READ IN MY LIFE--PURE NONSENSE! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE! I THINK I LOST IQ POINTS AFTER READING THIS GARBAGE. NOT TO MENTION THEY INSULT YOU EVERY OTHER PAGE!
1,whatever,I heard all the hype about this book and finally last night sat down and read it. Eww what's up with all the cursing and nasty language. What a total turn off. I will never read this book again.
1,Skinny bitch has a foul mounth,I started reading the Skinny Bitch diet book and at first was amused by all the cussing and the in your face attitude. But after awhile it got really old and I ended up putting the book down and not finishing it.
1,Class?,"Although, much of what is true in this book, I feel that ""cuss"" curse words were not needed. It shows no class or morality."
5,The truth is finally told!!,"It makes me sad to see how low these rating our, people are so brainwashed they don't know the truth when it is staring them in the face! If you have an open, unbrainwashed mind of your own and want the truth about the garbage, chemical laced food you chow down, this book is your answer. I was the world biggest meat eater eating only processed food and globs of meat all day every day for the last 20plus years, now I eat a mainly vegetarian diet with barley any meat at all. (So far no meat at all this week.) For those who like this I suggest watching FoodMatter and the Gerson Miricle. Good luck!! I hope you get unbrainwashed too!!"
5,Right on the money,"I'm not surprised by the negative reviews. People don't want to hear that the reason they're overweight and unattractive is because they're lazy and propping up a food system with more chemicals than a meth lab. The authors aren't encouraging anorexia, they're encouraging loving yourself, no matter what size you are, enough not to constantly shovel crap in your mouth. I've been a vegetarian for over a decade, including throughout a grueling ballet career, and I'm healthier, happier, and more energetic than any meat eater I know. The authors do rely a little heavily on fake meats, which are great for making the transition but not a great everyday option. Overall, an excellent book."
2,We should all buy guns and take up hunting,"I agree that factory farming of animals is cruel and sadistic.But I have a dog who happens to be a carnivore. He cannot live on grains and veggies, he needs meat. Cats and dogs fed a kibble diet suffer from many health problems that raw fed pets do not, since cats and dogs were never meant to eat cereal.For those of us with pets, it seems the only option is to start hunting/fishing for our own meat and fish. Bambi can have a nice life in the forest until she is shot between the eyes."
1,Hated it!,"I simply hated this book. I couldn't even finish reading it. It started off the right way, letting you know what things are in the different types of food that you may eat and how that's bad for you. But then it goes on to say ""If you want to be skinny, you have to be a vegetarian"". This book is ridiculous. I felt this book is no help watsoever. So, unless you're ready to give up everything you eat for soy based products, don't waste your time."
1,Phooey!,"Seems like the authors read several book by professional nutritionists--footnoted them--and passed them off as their own in what amounts to a third rate high school term paper. They do not take into consideration genetics, BMI or family history...it's just one long condesending rant by a couple of skinny models who probably decided to get healthy only after they quit snorting heroin to stay thin and posing for gap ads."
2,Skinny Bitch,"The product was rated either very good or good condition. The book came and their had been water spilled on it so the pages were all crinkled. I would not say that the rating was true to the product. It was readable, but I wouldn't even pass it on or sell it at a garage sale - spent too much on it for it to come in that condition."
3,"Insightful, but...","I loved that skinny Bitch makes you painfully aware of how horrible the things we eat are for you. It gives you plenty of back ground information on why its basically killing us slowly by drinking soda and eating processed food. The insight on how the government approves these harmful chemicals for use in food for human consumption makes me sick. However, at the end of the day the authors are saying you need to be a vegan to be a skinny bitch. That for me is unrealistic. Even after reading the book I know I will not stop eating meat. I have cut back on eating meat and aim to buy organic only. To some it up the message of the book is the government lies (true) and vegan= skinny bitch."
2,What's left to say about this book?,"Everyone loves it or hates it. I had no idea they were pushing a vegan existence. That being said, I think you can definately take away some good information from it. I, myself, chose not to read the chapters on animal slaughters. I also thought that they overlooked (accidentally, on-purpose) the fact that you can find local farmers and butchers and work with them for your meat. In our ever-growing organic and 'local' movements, I think they don't give us enough credit to find our meat or anything, for that matter, in a more responsible way. There were interesting parts, but the bottom line is, I wish I would have got it from the library instead of paying them. The even state in the book that one of the reasons they wrote it was to avoid getting real jobs. That seriously aggravates me. I think maybe they need a good slap, but I guess if they help one person, so be it."
1,Most women will not relate to this offensive and onesided book,"I bought this book thinking it would have interesting dietary tips about healthy eating while maintaining a normal lifestyle. I was wrong. These authors use their pseudoscientific information and one-sided opinions to bad mouth every woman who enjoys food. To sum it up this book preaches that to be ""skinny"" you MUST NOT eat or drink any of the following: meat (chicken, beef, pork, or fish), coffee, soda, dairy (including cheese), eggs, medicine, sugars of any kind. SKIP THIS BOOK unless you want info about veganism from two vulgar and foul-mouthed models."
2,One sided and obnoxious,"I admit it, I bought this on impulse. Based on the title, I thought it would be fun, and might have a couple good tips. Once I read it, I found it obnoxious. I'm not a ""fat slob"", and don't need to be called one.If you want a well informed take on a vegan diet, read Dr. Weil. He's not as attractive, but you'll learn a lot more.I gave it two stars because I thought the info on artificial sweetener was interesting."
3,Read it for motivation!!,"I agree that this book is a bit extreme, a bit tacky, and a bit over the top. BUT...if something in this world can push you into making better decisions for your body, why not find the positive in it? All that mattered to me was that it totally made me change what I was putting into my mouth and I am now healthier than I have ever been in my life. Heartburn? GONE. IBS? GONE. Colds/flu? GONE. Extra weight? GONE. The health benefits are amazing if you go vegan. Stop putting crap in your mouth! It's that easy :)"
1,This book gave me a headache,"I did not like this book. I thought it was a string of random statements without facts or explanations to back them up. I found it to be entirely lacking in substance. The authors provided little reasoning or scientific explanation. Reading it, I felt like I was listening to a friend who watched some segment on TV about nutrition and then decides to tell me about it, when I know she is just repeating what she heard and really has no idea what she's talking about. Annoying!Overall, I was very disappointed! While I certainly agree with some of the things they tell you to do, it gave me a headache to read. Would not recommend this to a friend."
3,Missed good points because...,"Good points in this seemingly well researched book get lost with all the foul language. I'm not a prude and do use all the words that they printed. However, they went on ad nauseaum. When I'm reading about pertinent information like they have in this book, it just seems senseless to continue the use of four letter words after a couple of times. I finally gave up after five chapters. I felt like I was being yelled at. What a shame."
4,Honest look at what you put in your mouth.,I bought this book because I loved the no no-nonsense view of how we treat our bodies by what we are putting into them. The authors don't allow you to make excuses so if your a whinnier and want to stay that way don't feel bad for yourself. They have a equally great cook book called skinny bitch in the kitchen that helps with the transition of nutrition you will want to make after reading this book. It's not a diet fad but an easy lifestyle change.
3,entertaining but needed more facts,"the title is a misnomer. buyers could pick up the book thinking they'll be getting a round of lifestyle and nutrition tips. instead they get two women expressing their very strong views about the state of the american food industry. and while their facts are valid, there are bits and pieces that they don't identify as the minuses to being vegan... and there are more than a few."
3,Crazy,"This book is very crazy. I think that it takes dieting a little too far. However, it's very educational and has tons and tons of tips for healthier living. I would consider everything without just following blindly, but there are definitely useful diet and lifestyle tips that are very easy to use and you don't even notice that you're eating healthier."
2,Too Many Inconsistancies For Shock Value!,"I love the snazzy title of Skinny B-, but there are too many inconsistencies throughout the book. I would suggest the author do her due diligence in researching the facts about diet and nutrition. All the shocking language might be entertaining for some, and promote book sales, but it's not for me. On the other hand, if you want entertainment with factual weight loss then check outI'LL TAKE THE FAT ONE."
1,Complete waste of time,"As a physician reasonably versed in nutrition, I can honestly say this book was a complete waste of time to read and money to buy. Their theories mostly back scientific validity and their ""buy all organic foods and become vegan otherwise you will get cancer"" attitude is hardly motivating or practical for those of us who live in the real world. The authors have no credibility in this field and the fact that they are models (and have written the book with a bad attitude) tends to make me even more suspicious about their knowledge base.It is quite amazing that NY Times rated this a bestseller. I will not be basing my book buying decisions on that anymore.Overall, I would stay away from this book. It is a poorly written book by bitchy ex-models who have not an ounce of true scientific training."
2,"Take the best, leave the rest","Some really great advice - clouded in four letter attacks to the reader. Yep, heard all these words before... have used these words before. So, I was not expecting Mary Poppins tells you how to eat well... however, swearing just dilutes the message here and really was a turn-off. (the tone is like diet tips from the eighth grade boy's locker room) - when in fact, they have some very important, needed diet & nutrition advice. Sadly, this book really lost it's crediblity for me - when doused with trash talk. Also - I am not a vegan... and some of the advice on eggs and meat is their opinion. But - at the end of the day - the authors are really trying to get you on the right track to eat well/live well. Their caring and concern does come through. Too bad - the four letter words just set the wrong tone for the book - and you tune out the good advice. The shock verbal value wears off pretty quickly - and soon and turns into boring."
2,Not too great...,"The humor in this short book is pretty good. But the propaganda and advice is not too great. Other than telling us the common sense version of eating a healthy and sensible diet low in processed foods, additives and sugars- these skinny B's have little to offer. Save your cash. I wish that I had.:("
1,terrible,"This book is terrible. It basically tells you to become vegan. This is definitely not for the casual dieter. This is telling you to completely, drastically change your lifestyle...not very realistic."
1,"Not my style, didn't learn a lot","This is definitely not my preferred way of learning, or educating myself. The book is a little degrading, a little vulgar, and a little harsh. I feel as if too much of the author's personal beliefs/way of life, came through in the book. When I read a book about diet and nutrition, I like to hear acts and useful information. This book is filled with vulgarity, as they ""tell you how it is without sugar coating"". Honesltly, I believe there is a better, and more mature way, of getting your point across. i guess I should have assumed it would be like that, based on the title. I learned a tiny bit,i.e. aspartame is bad, the meat industry is evil, try to eat organic as much as possible. But other that that, the book left me uninspired."
1,wasnt for me,Thought this was a book about dieting and was hoping to get some helpful tips but instead I got a feminist preaching about being vegan. I felt like I was watching a peta video. I stopped reading after the first chapter and regret spending money. Should have known it was a bad idea when the price was 6.66.
2,Unnecessarily Crude,"I was looking forward to this book after I skimmed a few pages at the bookstore. I wanted to read more about eating right and and living a more healthy lifestyle...and in need of something less dull to read. The title ""Skinny Bitch"" certainly sets the tone of the book. I found some of the topics to be helpful, but I couldn't get over how unnecessarily crass this book was. It was obnoxious. After reading half of the book, I practically just skimmed through the rest and then threw it in the airport trash. I would not recommend this to anyone that eats meat. It could be offensive."
3,"Fun Read, Common Sense, a little preachy","I am a vegetarian, and I liked this book, I thought it was funny, full of common sense and interesting information. If you are not a vegetarian, and not interested in becoming one, I don't suggest reading this book. Although I had a great time reading it, I do feel like the book has very little in the nutritional advice department, it's much more focussed on berating the USDA, dairy industry and meat industry. Although I agree with what they were saying, it is basically propaganda, and if you are looking for a structured, and researched diet plan you won't find it in this book."
1,A book that caters and creates eating disorders!!!!!!!!,"To whom it may concern,I recently had a very disturbing interview with a patient of mine with a SEVERE eating disorder. This patient used this book as her ""bible"" before developing an eating disorder and learned things like "" skinny people make happy people"" and to basically only eat vegetables and fruits therefore restricting her diet which is an essential component of an eating disorder. She idealized the authors(both ex models who likely have eating disorders themselves) and followed their book and ended up very sick and requiring a hospital admission to psychiatry. This book states near the end ""...don't develop an eating disorder on us"" Oops I think you may be creating themMy advice as a physician is do not buy this book and dipose of it if you own it!!!!I plan to pursue this further and do some research on the subject to protect future patients."
5,Skinney Bitch,Loaded with helpful nutritional info for diet or healthful purposes.Gives a realistic view of the end treatment of our animal food line.
2,More bitch than skinny,"This book is basically a peta pamphlet cleverly disguised as a diet book. There is some good information on how to become a vegetarian, and good reasons to avoid meat and dairy products, but becoming a vegetarian (while it may be healthier) does not seem to have any weight loss effect. After reading the book I really wanted to see if it could work and stuck to only ""Skinny Bitch"" approved foods - after several weeks no difference whatsoever. It also bothered me that the book protests the cruelty of animals but seems to have no problem with the abuse of its readers. You will loose more self esteem from reading this book than you will weight. If you want to eat healthier, become a vegetarian and discover new ways to hate yourself, then this is the book for you, but don't buy it expecting to loose any weight."
2,Why is this book so popular?,"I am surprised this book moved pass the editing room floor. This is the cleaned up version that actually made it to the shelves? The authors address the readers as if we are all sniveling retarded 2 year olds. I did like the factual information that posed in the book, however, the authors fail to mention the subjectivity of the data. I am surprised the authors made it out of high school let alone college with the severe uppity sorority girl attitude that is laced throughout the entire book.I appreciate the main points on animal cruelty, eating organic, healthy diet etc; but I think that it would have more of an impact without the airheaded persona."
2,Did Paris Hilton write this? No? Really? She could have!,"You have to have a certain cheeky attitude to enjoy this book. Some of it is written like Paris Hilton wrote it with a nutritionist sitting over her shoulder inserting footnotes. And speaking of footnotes, or rather endnotes - there are ALOT in this book and some are from books written 20 years ago by other wannabe ""experts"" with little substance. It's almost like a girl's high school science class report on ""why girls should be a vegan and look like a model"".But it is a little fun and a quick read (I was done with it after a two hour plan ride) in part because of all the pages of endnotes in the back and the large spaced out font. Basically, the book looks longer than it really is.Overall, it was a silly book that was a fun and easy read and it did remind me why I should cut dairy out of my diet! Beyond that- nothing to it."
2,Entertaining but facts aren't all there.,"I expected a totally different book just from reading the title. As usually they support their opinions with pro facts but forget to include the cons. It is interesting to read but I would not use it as a diet guide. Most of the things are already known: eat organic, avoid sugar and etc. There are plenty of other credible nutrition books out there."
2,Main message: Become a vegan and be skinny,"I would not recommend this book to women looking for advice on how to lose weight. A detailed judgment on the cruelty of the meat packing industry as a deterrent to eating meat was the part of this book that I most remember. I am not a vegan, do not intend to become one and fully believe that you can live a healthy and slender life while eating meat and dairy products. Additionally, I am sure the authors intended their writing to be ""tongue-in-cheek"" however much of it writing came off as crass."
2,It could have been SO MUCH better,"I'll admit, the title got me. I'm sorry I spent the money. Overall, most of their advice is what I've known for a long time - junk food is just that and it only belongs in the garbage, not your mouth. However, I didn't need the profanity!! I've never in my life PAID MONEY for a book that uses the ""f-word"" so liberally. I'm no prude, but I got to the point that I could not continue.I disagree with the vegetarian part. God put meat on this earth for a reason. Protein is important. It's hard to get from vegetable sources. If you are hypothyroid - DO NOT follow the advice about the soy!!!!Next time I'll read the reviews.Cheryl Wisdom, MS, RN"
1,Save Your Money!,"I wish Amazon had partial stars to give. These two prove it's not what you know but who you know in order to get published. They have taken others information and added their own (every other word profanity) that does nothing to bolster their feeble attempts at being authors. Just go to the end of their ""book?"" and jot down other author's names and websites that offer the same information these two are trying to impress you with."
2,okay but could have been MUCH better,"there is some decent health information in this book coupled with some self-esteem oriented verbiage but the book just comes off sort of ""immature"", i guess i should have expected that with the title. the book shares several tidbits of useful information peppered with highly opinionated views. i also didn't see the point of so much cursing (and i'm not a prude) but it just seemed out of place. i actually considered buying it at first for the tips but after reading it in the bookstore i knew it was the kind of book i'd never pick up again so i opted for something much more balanced and mature. this book would probably be a great gag gift for someone but other than that there are much better diet/nutrition books on the market."
4,Keeping It Real,"OMG, this book kept it very real about the torturing of these poor animals that live in slaughterhouses. I don't know how anyone could consume meat after reading this book. I am Vegan b/c of this book. Save an animal b/c karma is a bit3h. If you like pork chops, you will comeback as a pig, Karma. You are what you eat, so if you eat ham, you are a PIG. Embrace & love vegetarianism, so you could be healthy. Eat to live, don't live to eat. Befriend animals, don't eat them. Thank you, Rory and Kim for such an informative book."
2,Entirely extreme! Insane!,"This book is CRAZY. If you want to spend the rest of your life TERRIFIED of just about every food item but, say, kelp, DON'T READ IT. According to these authors, all meat, poultry, dairy, egg products, and almost all sweeteners are pure poison. This is not the right approach to healthy eating. Food is the fuel of life. If you want to develop a raging eating disorder and die, this book is for you. Otherwise, skip it. Besides, at the end of the book, the authors say something along the lines of ""P.S. We couldn't care less about being skinny.""All that said, I did like the chapter on defecating. It is important to poo multiple times per day. If not, there's probably something wrong with you.Oh and personally I couldn't care less about what some other reviewers have labelled ""vulgar"" language. That's how young people talk. Period."
5,Fantastic!!,"I thought this book was great.i'm a nutrition minor and i know a lot of what they're saying is true.I read this book because my girlfriend told me it was a funny approach to losing weight and becoming conscious of what you put in your mouth, but she didnt know how much of it to believe, since many of these books are inaccurate.Take it from me!99.8% of this book is true.It is not an attempt to make you a vegan or anorexic.I do admit however that without a background in this field, one may think a lot of it is untrue.Listen to the skinny bitches, they know what theyre talking about."
2,vegan recruiters,"The book started out promising but then quickly turned into a ""go vegan"" rant. The authors bring up good points about avoiding overprocessed foods and sugar in order to become a ""skinny bitch"" but most of the chapters cover why everything meat and dairy will kill you slowly and make you fat."
1,A zero would be better!!,"I've bought this book when I was a vegan, a militant one, and found the language in it insulting even for me who was eating this way, so I gave it away to a friend of mine, who was insulted just like me, so we decided to put it in the paper garbage, a green choice for this horrible book."
1,A big fat lie,This book is NOT a diet book it's a manifesto for the wacko PETA group. It's a scare tactic filled with lies to make you afraid to eat meat and convince you to be a vegan. I'm livid that they took their wacky animal rights agenda and made it out to be a diet book so they could coerce people into buying it.A TOTAL WASTE of money.
4,GOOD STUFF,I ENJOYED RECEIVING THE BOOK IN LESS TIME THAN EXPECTED AND HAVE COMPLETED READING THE BOOK
2,SKINNY B*****,"GOOD INFORMATION, TERRIBLE LANGUAGE. THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY TO CONVEY THE IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR. WE PUT THE BOOK AWAY AND DIDN'T FINISH IT."
1,Stuck up and change everything,"I actually returned this book and I never do that. This book basically tells you to stop doing everything a normal person would do and become an organic vegan. No thanks. It's written very clever so I give it a star for that, but I""m not a stuck up bitch so I didn't care for the book."
2,Good but hard to read...,"I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of $$ on this book. It was a quick read and informative, but I didn't need all the S and F-bombs throughout. Trust me, I'm not offended by those words, but when they are used so excessively it's hard to weed out the true wisdom these two ladies are trying to convey."
3,too be or too not to be,"Its a great read. Awesome ideas and great advice. But I didnt like that there was three chapters on the evils of the meat and dairy industery... mind you I am vegan and have been for 7 years I think it might scare some away. overall, great book , easy read and overall good."
2,Disappointed,"The title attracted me to the book, however the language used turned me off completely. I think somewhere in the reviews it should mention that it is entirely propaganda for vegetarianism."
1,crass,"I found this book to be really offensive. I follow a very healthy lifestyle and I am always interested in reading about ways to improve but I just couldn't get through this book. I don't think it is funny but if you like being cursed at and called foul names, you might enjoy it! I would never buy this for a friend or recommend it. Probably an attempt at being edgy that fell flat. Too bad, cause I support SOME of the ideas like eating natural, organic, real food and getting the preservatives and crap out of your diet."
2,Hmmm. Not What I Expected.,"Skinny Bitch is profane and opinionated. Parts of it are funny, and parts - ONLY parts - are related to dieting.The premise of the book is healthy dieting, but essentially it's about promoting the vegan lifestyle and exposing errors or mistakes our government has made in the food and drug industry.I enjoyed the book. It was entertaining, even if I don't agree with their values. I certainly don't intend to quit eating meat and sugar. The bottom line is: Skinny Bitch is entertaining but bogus."
1,Skinny Bitch,"This book had some solid ideas regarding the chemicals that we daily put in our bodies and the amount of food we consume. With that said, the overall theme was a little overwhelming in regards to the big bad meat eaters and the fasting with consumption of only water for a day, and or more if you tolerate it. Mind you, they do recommend consulting your physician before entering such and endeavor. I do believe the non-educated consumer would fair much better to consult their physician for a weight loss program, or research a healthier text to assist their own trials. Poor advice all around ."
4,Worth it,"I found their approach refreshing and granted it was more of a rant against animal cruelty and slaughter houses, it did make me think twice about what I was really eating."
2,"So promising, but ultimately a failure","The authors should be applauded for using references throughout their section detailing reasons to avoid animal products. The positives end there, unfortunately.First, I like zippy, witty language as much as the next person (probably more!) but this was just gratuitous vulgarity. I don't want to be told that I'll like something so much my ""pubes will fall out."" How is this language anything more than distracting, at best? And this goes on and on....Second, the book is SO self-contradicting to the point of being useless. First, we're told to avoid sugar. Next, we're told chocolate soy milk is a staple (to name only one of many examples). Their instructions to fast for basically as long as possible, is deeply troubling and irresponsible. It's unfortunate because the book had such promise to deliver a worthwhile message about animal cruelty and the health benefits of veganism to a more ""fashion/style-oriented"" audience."
1,Yawn,"If you want a book that will put you to sleep, this is the one. It's very boring. I thought it was going to be an entertaining, humorous read, but boy was I wrong. The first couple chapters are okay, but just when you think it's going to start getting good, it gets disappointing. It's an old rant on the food and dairy industry. By the time it started bashing the Bush administration, I was fast asleep."
1,Misrepresented,"This was with diet books, so I expected a dieting pep talk. The first three chapters ranted about carbs and additives and sugar. They were funny and somewhat mean, but with ""bitch"" in the title, you expect that. Then at Chapter 4 they take a hard left and start referring to meat as dead, rotting, decomposing flesh, putrefying corpses, and worse. Then they started in on milk. Basically they are trying to gross you into becoming vegan. The back of the book doesn't even hint at vegetarian or veganism, so I feel misled.There's a lot of broad assertions with no science to back it up, lists of ""Good brands"" to eat from, and they constantly say things like ""Don't be a fat pig any more!"" This isn't a diet book. It isn't a pep talk. It's emotional abuse."
1,Vegan conspiracy theory propaganda.,"The real title for the book should be vegan conspiracy theory propaganda. And it is hidden well so a causal glance does not let you know what you're in for. Waste of my time, the back of the book should let you know what you're in for instead of misleading you! Words do not describe my angst over this book."
1,This book is not about getting skinny!,"When I first read a few pages I found this witty, however, after further reading, these 2 non-doctor ex-models just want to turn the world into Vegan-vegetarians. They really cross the line when they instruct the reader that aspirin, allergy meds and any other item bought to relieve pain are basically POISON. Really, everything that you could possibly ingetstthat does not come from a plant is termed POISON by these girls. WOW, what a realistic guide for the average American gal! Their choice of foul language doesn't really help their credibility, either. Waste of money."
1,Farce,This was a waste of money. Instead of any dietary advice it was a political stand on cruelty to animals. While I support humane treatment of animals I feel this book title is very misleading
1,Dangerous book written for naive impressionable young girls,This book I would say verges on being DANGEROUS. The target audience seems to be young pre-teen and teenage girls who are naive and impressionable. The book gives bad dietary advice.
1,Not for me!,"You should only buy this book if you are seriously considering becoming a vegan. Here...I'll summarize what the book says so you don't even have to buy it: meat is bad, dairy is bad, processed food is bad, organic fruits, veg and whole grains are good. There I just saved you $10 and a few hours.It's hardly a diet plan, there are only a few blurbs on exercise and it pretty much repeats stuff you've heard elsewhere, except they REALLY push the veganism. In fact, they even include some sad stories about how poorly farm animals are treated to make you feel even guiltier. I think it's really unrealistic for most people and am kinda bummed I bought it..."
1,Dangerous Ideas,"I don't know how this book ever got published. The very first chapter states that ""Healthy=skinny. Unhealthy=fat"". Another line from their book, ""after a few days, you'll grow to love that empty feeling in your stomach and know that the initial headaches, nausea, and hunger were just your body's cleaning crew."" Um, hello? Is this the ""how to become an anorexic manual""? I feel that this book could become very dangerous in the hands of teenage girls or others who are not well read in fitness and nutrition.The authors are insulting (""don't be a fat pig anymore""), boorish (""there is no greater pleasure than taking a big, steamy dump""), and vulgar (too many examples using the f-word and other vulgarities).I can't believe I wasted a good hour or so skimming through this muddled mess of misinformation. At least I checked it out of the library and didn't spend a penny for this useless garbage."
1,"Dumb vegans hiding behind the ""girlfriend"" book trend",Don't bother with this book unless you are teaching critical thinking and want some easy fodder for your class. It's vegan propaganda wrapped in an eating disorder promotion.
4,"good info, do with it what you want","I bought this book after reading other reviews about how frank it is regarding the foods we consume & how they're prepared before they get to the stores. This book promotes a vegan lifestyle, but I am not ready to make that kind of commitment. So, I took the points that made sense to me & have used it in my change to become a pescatarian (no red meat, chicken, pork; only fish). If you do not like ""foul"" language, this is not the book for you. If you don't mind colorful language & want more information on what is going on in the food industry, this will be an enjoyable read. Very helpful resources on where to get the best organic foods. You will definitely learn a thing or two after reading this book, and will think before you eat."
2,Misleading,"The primary objective of this book is to shock the reader into becoming a Vegan. It is not a diet or weight-loss book.Just know that the co-author, Kim Barnouin, is a former model who did most of the book's ""research"". She lists that she has a Master of Science in Holistic Nutrition. What she doesn't say is she got the degree through the mail, from Clayton College of Natural Health, a non-accredited natural health school.So if you choose to become a Vegan due to the hormones that the put into livestock, the poor conditions that they live in, or the in-humane way that they are killed, that is perfectly understandable. But don't confuse this book with anything scientific or written by an expert on the subject, because it is not."
5,Life changing... read it.,"I picked up this book while I was going through a bit of a self-esteem and self-image crisis. Little did I know that this book would change my life. I was one of the ""ignorant"". As I read through the pages of in-your-face honesty, I was completely shocked at what I had been doing to my body all along. And, I'm happy to note, I've been a vegetarian ever since. Great book all together. A definate must read for anyone who wants to know how to lose weight and be one-hundred percent healthy."
1,Some fun..but cant to be taken too seriously,"On pg. 53, the author writes ""We encourage you to think for yourself and make your own decision"". This line reflects why I would not recommend this read. the women who wrote this leave no room for you to form your own decision on their radical rules to becoming a skinny b*tchThe book basically bashes anyone who eats meat, dairy, and white bread. ok, who doesnt eat those things from time to time? its unrealistic and a good deal of the suggestions aren't backed up by credible sources (who cares is Dr. Andrew Weil says drink soy milk... who the heck is he?!!?)Its a lighthearted read that appeals to the fashionista, jet setting type of person. and there are some good food recommendations for vegan types."
2,A tiny bit of good info,"I picked this book up thinking from the title and back cover it would provide some helpful insight into good (if not great) nutritional decisions. While I did pick up on a few facts that can help me with my own healthy diet, overall I was disappointed in this book. I thought it was inflammatory and biased. Plus, there is an inherent agenda that becomes painfully obvious after the first couple of chapters.If you have to buy it, get it used and save a few bucks."
3,Book is for Vegans or people thinking about becoming Vegan,"Granted, some of this book made me laugh out loud and reconsider some of the things I was eating. But overall, is a book telling you to go Vegan. The book doesn't talk enough about organic foods and free-range meats. It is all about meat, eggs, and milk = being fat...no matter if it comes from organic free-range sources or not."
1,awful,Vegan diet- There was nothing in this that I didn't already know and couldn't care less. Don't waste your time.
2,Not what I expected...,"I was hoping this would be a light hearted read to motivate me into some better eating habits, and whilst the book started out that way; only a couple of chapters in it turned out to be an evangelistic approach to pro vegan-ism. If you're like me and enjoy a good steak, dairy products or other meat products, then this book may not be for you."
5,"Great book, sensible advice, fun and well-written","There are too many diet books touting strange foods, weird combinations, and short term starvation. This is NOT one of them.A sensible, well-written book, 'Skinny Bitch' tells it like it is - that the ONLY way to long term weight loss is to eat a balanced diet full of fresh fruit and vegetables."
4,a good book,"I'm a vegetarian for more than 10 years and found this book useful .I really din't care about the facts of the industry of meat and the goverment issues because I already know about this.I did found a lot of useful and great information about becoming a vegan.You can't follow or believe everything people say. If you like me just want some information ,recipes and products you can use this is a goood book."
3,Very informative but I still like real food.,"I love the way the authors tell you ""how it is"" and drive their points across with the data and references. Personally, I can completely get behind the idea of eating more natural foods and getting rid of anything that's processed and fake. What I don't get however is that they push other fake foods to replace real ones. One menu example was a turkey club with fake turkey, fake bacon and veganaise. As a ""meat-eater"", that goes too far, I'm looking for better choices, not unrealistic ones. I almost shut the book there. I would recommend this book to people that are looking to understand what processed foods and chemicals do to your body, but leave the fake foods out. Why would I want something processed to look like turkey? I'll just have turkey, I will however have my turkey without the hormones. I'm learning already!"
2,Perfect book for the gullible girl.,"OMG--I had to read this book after seeing my SIL become a vegan overnight and lose a ton of weight. If you like being made to feel like an idiot, and can tolerate profane words being tossed at you like the salads these two ladies live on--then buy this book!! It basically goes over all the common sense ways we should be eating and basically makes you feel like a second-class-citizen if you choose to eat any meat product. BE WARNED: If you will not even consider the possibility of being a vegan, than this book is NOT for you--it goes into some pretty graphic banter about how animals are treated in a slaughterhouse (any animal advocate already knows this stuff)--I thought the book to be a waste of my reading time and intellegence. I'll stick with my ""common sense"" diet which is minimal processed/fried/junk foods and more all natural foods--see I just saved you around $15.00!!! LOL"
2,All Hype,"The authors of this book used a cute and edgy title to get our attention, and then filled the book with sass and ridiculous diet notions. You cannot expect people in this society to go 100% organic vegan, and you cannot expect people to fast for any length of time. I believe that people can shed pounds and be healthy without going to such extremes. Won't some people read this book and simply give up before they even try to change their lives because the suggestions of this book seem out of the realm of reality? The only positive result I might be able to imagine would be that readers with awful habits will adopt SOME of the ideas in the book and any change is better than none."
2,A good message but with juvenile writing,"The proposed lifestyle in this book is extreme. The truth is that Americans do not moderate anything. All foods in moderation equal a healthier body and yes, pure water is the only liquid a body should injest. However, the juvenile vernacular seems to suggest the authors have a very basic and limited vocabulary. Where were the editors when this book was written?"
1,Common Sense,"I can't believe these women are getting paid to state the obvious. I also can't believe I picked up this book. It seems to me it was written by a Comp 101 freshman girl. Yes, it is that bad."
2,Weak,"Profanity is the strongest expression of a weak mind. There's plenty of it in here. I don't need the *F* bomb dropped for me to understand one is trying to make a point. It actually detracts from it. Too bad. There is some good information in here--eating real, whole foods like fruits and veggies and kicking crappy foods out of your diet, but then goes to list overly processed substitutions for meat. When I read through an example month of meals, almost every day had ""fake"" something or other listed. To go from meat to processed fake something or other is not a step in the right direction if one wants to be healthy. It was sort of a funny read at times, but most of this book is common sense, nothing new."
1,A rant - had to return!!!,"Dead rotting carcass. The entire book is about the extreme vegan. Not even a healthy vegan. Just plain extreme. Sorry, but I'd wager a filet from a grass-fed, free-range, hormone-free cow is a better choice for one's body than the processed trash these authors advocate. Vegan cheese, ""meat"", chocolate...processed crap!If you're looking for a book to help you make healthy choices, this isn't it. It doesn't encourage eating clean or eating well. This book is nothing more than a poorly written attempt to convert the reader to vegan. And, there's nothing wrong with a vegan lifestyle but it's not until the trash is in your hands that you realize how over-the-top it is. These women should have collaborated on an opinion piece, not on something they pretend is informative."
1,I meant NO STARS,"I wanted to learn more about the vegan point of view and someone recommended this book to me, I picked it up and skimmed a few pages and was just put off by the bad vibes this book was giving off. I put it back on the shelf, way way back and bought Kathy Freston's Veganist book instead.Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World"
1,The worst book ever!,"I'll get right to the point. The language is crass and trashy. It's like she was trying to force profanity into the sentence just for dramatic effect. There is nothing, I repeat nothing new in this book. They hook you with the ""catchy"" title and curses like true wh... trash pretty much all the way through. She bashes meat eating, saying the human body cannot handle animal fat. Ok, I'm semi-vegetarian but I will not exaggerate to make anyone follow me. This is hyperbole, at it's finest, written by two model chicks who are highly skilled at cut-and-paste. SORRY I BOUGHT IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,This is book is tasteless in it's delivery...such a shame!,"Okay....so I got the book....not a fan. Although my fault, I should have ""known"" from the title but I just do not care for the foul language throughout the book and name calling. Really? Did they need to go there? Do they think it's funny? Maybe I'm just a prude. But I have always felt using foul language lessens anything you are trying to say....just takes away from the credibility of it. It's childish, it's offensive, it's unnecessary. So in the garbage it went....never got past Chapter 1. I know I can learn much more from much more respectable authors, and plan to do so."
5,I strongly recommended this book for my students,"Fortunately, I discovered ""Skinny Bitch"" and recommended it to my high school students. The strong language in the book actually doesn't compare to the language I hear every day while walking in the halls, and the students relate to its no-nonsense writing style. With rising rates of childhood obesity and depression due to distorted body image, this book is a must for teenagers. ""Skinny Bitch"" is unlike any other ""diet"" book, as it truly will make you repulsed by bad foods so that you no longer crave them. Fortunately, the book also provides a long list of specific foods that you can eat so that you'll never feel like you're missing out on foods that you love. Do yourself and favor and read this book!"
5,Life Changing!,This book really changed my outlook on what I put into my body. I've made some changes to my diet and have already dropped 10 lbs! Awesome book!
2,overly dramatic,"This book is a shrine to vegans. As one myself, I thought it would reinforce the reasons I decide to stay away from animal products. However it got old real fast. And also their constant 'young hip in your face attitude' is a little too rediculous. With their endless use of ""fat ass"" and ""dumb ass"", I would much rather prefere to read a 'diet book' where, with every turn of the page, I am not despising the author more and more.My recomendation: stay away!!"
1,Skinny Bitch? More Like Become a Vegan Bitch,"I have never in my life returned a book until I purchased this one. Completely misleading and inaccurate, this book is nothing more than vegan/vegetarian propaganda and provides little to no advice on how to eat healthy. And while I appreciate the ""tough love"" approach, the tone of this book is condescending and nasty at times. Real savvy women know that you don't need to be vegan/vegetarian to live a healthy life. As far as I'm concerned, these authors are incredibly irresponsible people who shouldn't be giving advice to anyone. If you really want to eat healthy, buy a book from an actual expert -- not a self-proclaimed know-it-all and a ditz with claims to have a degree that doesn't really exist."
4,Great plea for eating vegan,Initially I loved the way the authors wrote using a pretty direct language but after a while I thought it was getting a bit too much. Reading about the the meat industry and how animals are beeing treated gave me a lot to think about. In some cases I think they are a little bit too extreem but overall a good book for all of those who are interested in nutrition and dieting.
1,Vulgar and Senseless,"This book is incredibly vulgar with completely offensive & gratuitous language. I was completely turned off by their poor writing and the profanity. The claims the authors make about cancer and other health ailments are baseless, despite they footnoted whe whole book. The sources are questionable at best. I competely believe in the benefits of a vegan/vegetarian lifestlye, so it's not their ideas - it's their excution. Don not buy this book - it's a waste."
3,"go vegan, lose weight","Some of this is useful, but it is not very practical, and is generally too much ranting for my tastes. It is worth reading for some useful nuggets and is generally humorous and well written."
3,SKINNY BITCH,"This book seems a little bit extreme...but that's what I was interested in reading, too...has some good pointers and facts. Some of the curse words could be left out. Oh, and Skinny DOES NOT ALWAYS = Healthy!!! Hope nobody seriously would believe that anyway!!! But, if you skim through and take away facts, or whatever you feel comfortable with, this could be a solid motivator to someone looking for useful information on living a MORE healthy life."
5,Eye-opening!!,"I absolutely loved this book. Literally could not put it down; read it in two days. All of the facts on how awful animal products for our bodies are were amazing, yet disgusting at the same time. I had no idea about any of this whatsoever. I recommend this book to any woman struggling with weight or simply looking to improve her health even further.I can honestly say that after reading ""Skinny Bitch"" and Eric Schlosser's ""Fast Food Nation,"" I have been inspired to go vegan to help not only animals who are currently being abused but also myself who I myself am abusing with these unnecessary byproducts of poor, helpless cows, chickens, horses, you name it."
1,"Nothing new in this book, dont waste your money","There isn't anything new in this book as far as information. Don't we all know that slaughterhouses are not day camps?This book has all the same old information we already know, but with swear words thrown in! Oh how original! It reminded me of when my 2 year old kept repeating the word ""poop"" to see if we would get all upset.I am vegan. I found nothing new in the book and a few things that were actually wrong.I'm not sure why all the swearing and vulgarity was added to the text, shock value I guess, but frankly, most of us have heard it all and we just get bored with it after awhile. It just seemed very immature and like a scam...I guess they are laughing at us all the way to the bank."
2,Inspiration for diet change but too extreme for me,Bought it for the title and the buzz. Needed some inspiration for staying on track with nutrition and calories. Turned out to be a preachy pitch for veganism. Disappointed. I already know enough about vegan to be totally bored; didn't like the distortion of facts and scare tactics; didn't want to be inculcated. Best part of the book was the swear words :=)
1,I'm getting my money back!,"This book is absolutely disgusting with no merit whatsoever. The ""scientific "" evidence they spew is SO offbase........and spew they do....I'm no prude, but their language is shocking and revolting! Do they really believe they are going to shock people into cutting out soda or aspartame by calling them horrible names, and using the most foul language I have ever read in a published book?? I am absolutely amazed that this book was actually published, AND placed in a prominent spot at Barnes and Noble!! What is happening to this country?? It says on the cover ""Best Seller""..........say it aint so!! It must just be another lie these two shameless, uneducated, lowlife women are trying to perpetuate! People, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
4,"Great Information, can't buy into to it all...","I really appreciate their straight talk. I had no idea when I purchased the book they would be pushing veganism. They opened my eyes to the state of our food and how the slaughterhouses are being run. For that I give this book 4 stars. But the chances of me giving up cheese and eggs are slim to none and they shouldn't try and scare the reader into thinking you are a bad person for eating meat, dairy, eggs. There are other alternatives to the mass produced food. And there are plenty of chickens laying eggs who are free to move about and act like chickens."
1,I want my money back...,"I couldn't get past the first several chapters... I felt hazed, berated, and belittle and I am in very good shape. Crass would be the only word to describe this book. It might have some good points, but I didn't feel like weeding through the profanity to get to it. If you want a good book on health written by actual doctors I recommendYOU: The Owner's Manual: An Insider's Guide to the Body that Will Make You Healthier and Younger, and alsoYou: On A Diet: The Owner's Manual for Waist Management."
1,"A vulgar book, that is not for everyone","There are some good tips in this book, but the vulgar way in which the information is discussed I find really tragic. I don't need to be cursed at to understand the value of nutrition, so what could have been a really funny and interesting book becomes a four letter word cuss-a-thon! I find the homage to Tony Robbins and Dr Wayne Dyer, a complete joke...These men would never subject their readers to such immature profanity...that serves no other purpose, than shock value. Too bad being a vegan can't clean out your mouth!"
5,Hilarious!,This book is crazy funny as well as being full of useful and important info about the stuff we eat and drink.
4,Great purchase,Great book for adults only!!! I agree with some of the information but there are some issues about meat I really did not agree with. Overall its a fast and easy read.
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"I absolutely love this book. It is incredibly easy to read. It is short, yet it covers all the bases of eating healthy. I thought I already knew everything there was to know about basic butrition- but this book taught me so much more. I borrowed my friend's copy and liked it so much I bought my own. Then I loaned it to another friend and she liked it so much that she bought her own as well, and is getting her friends to read it. It really is a great book. I am appalled that anyone can even criticise this book. There is a plethora of references in the back and everything they include in the book is factual information."
2,Not what I had expected,"I bought this book thinking it was going to be different based on the title. I did not like how biased this book was. I have nothing against the vegetarian and vegan lifestyles but this book was really forcing that lifestyle choice on EVERYONE. And if you didn't not want to live that way, you were disgusting. Although, their disturbing chapters on animal cruelty were eye-opening, they did not change the fact that I am a meat-eater. I guess that makes me disgusting!Also, the language was a little on the offensive side at times. Granted, I have used some of these words at times, I didn't see the need to publish a book with that kind of language. I don't know if the authors thought it made them seem more modern or ""cool"", but it just made them sound uneducated. If someone is trying to give you advice, are you really going to take it from someone with a foul mouth?All in all, the book was just OK. It had SOME good advise and tips."
3,entertaining with decent information,"I found this book to be very entertaining and the references and sources in the back of the book were helpful. I just disagree with the vegan diet. I think a more balanced approach can work better. This approach as mentioned in books like ""The Six-Pack Diet Plan"" by Rehan Jalali and the South Beach Diet has worked well for me. I do think their approach is worth a try if you are having trouble losing weight. I did find the information on dairy fairly eye opening."
1,Book wants you to become a vegan; don't be fooled.,"The premise of the book is to try and persuade readers to become vegetarians/vegans.I was looking forward to reading it, and was thoroughly disappointed and later angered by some of the idiocies written in it. As I started reading through the first couple of chapters, I enjoyed the style the book was written in, with it's sassy language. Later, it just disappointed me. Don't buy it. If you know someone that has it, borrow it. If you're in a bookstore, sneak away and read chapters 5 and 6 before you decide to buy it."
1,"Very Disappointed, USA",I thought this book was one of the worst diet related books I have ever read. I was truly frustrated to have spent my hard earned money on this books purchase. These readers are out of touch with how most individuals feel about a reasonable way to diet and stay healthy. Many of their suggestions are ridiculous. I read half of this book and threw it in the trash. Do not buy this book it is a waste of your money.
1,awful awful awful!!!!,"This book is written by lame models who preach a vegan diet by scaring you with fake facts and figures. If you take a look at the sources they cite, you will notice that they are mostly pro-vegan websites that have no basis for the information they preach. A definite waste of time and money. If you want to be healthy and live a better life, I suggest purchasing a book where the author has studied dieting and nutrition. Don't trust these models!!!"
4,Alleluia! (from a meateater),"I'm not a vegan, and although I liked this book, I don't plan on becoming one. However, the authors made some very valid points that anyone on a diet should note:1. Soda, especially diet soda, is very bad. 2. Water, fruit and vegetables are diet staples 3. You must exercise 4. Complex carbs aren't bad, in fact they're quite necessary. 5. Sugar, not carbs, create fatThis is a love it or hate it book. It's in-your-face and well researched (check out the works cited.) Ms. Barnouin even hold a MS in nutrition. With that said, I trust their claims are as valid as Al Gore's in ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Although the research is there, the findings may not be entirely accurate.I found the overuse of language a bit unnecessary, but overall I think anyone, vegan, vegetarian, or meateater, can learn something from this book, as I have."
1,Terrible,"If you came to this book having paid any attention at all to healthy eating, etc. it will not tell you anything new, and as other reviewers have commented, there are several inaccuracies. I'm not on the vegan bandwagon, so this book was useless to me."
1,Horrible Book,"I started my weight loss journey on January 1st 2011. I am currently down 25.5 lbs. I began my weight loss journey by reading a ton of books (16.5 at last count)... this one was by far the worst.Very little accurate scientific information about weight lossA lot of information about why you should be a vegan and what happens in slaughter houses. This is a subject I am fascinating with, and if you are as well... I would recommend the movie Food Inc.However, this makes a lousy weight loss book.I would write more but I quit about half way through (and I finished the other 16... even though others were slightly less than useful)...I'm just happy I purchased this book on my kindle. I'd feel bad if I helped kill a tree to create this garbage."
1,A PETA meeting in disguise?,"I first saw this book in stores. I wish I had read any sort of review online first. It really appealed to my fabulous side, along with my desire to be skinny. Unfortunately it really had nothing to do with dieting. It was more about two failed models trying to use ""hip"" filthy language to push their beliefs on the public. I'm pretty sure the back cover didn't mention that the book would leave me sobbing in bed about how people slaughter pigs. That was not what I signed up for. If I was interested in joining PETA I would send Ingrid a check. However shallowly, I was only interested in getting skinny. This book didn't help. It only made me cry."
1,Very funny and VERY disappointing,"I bought this w/o looking at the review which was a big mistake. I was not offended by the language or the analogies, and thought that it was very funny and well written. The authors don't spare anyone's feelings. I found that part refreshing.HOWEVER, the book makes no mention in the first chapters, or on the back cover that it is actually going to be preaching veganism to you. After reading their sources and finding a recurring one to be PETA (that has less than ethical practices)I began to doubt some of their other sources as well. If you are a big bleeding-heart liberal, then buy this book, and as the authors suggest ""make up your own mind"" by buying into all of this garbage.This book should be in the politics section and not the health section."
2,"Yep, it's rather misleading","This is an entertaining book, and I like the in-your-face approach, but I don't think it will appeal to the average person. I wish that the back cover blurb had indicated that it was a book to prepare readers to go vegetarian and then vegan. I'm not quite prepared for that, so the great majority of the book was useless to me. It's a very quick (too quick perhaps) read as well; I finished the whole thing (skipping the meal suggestions chapter) in about 45 minutes. Overall, I was very disappointed."
1,eh,"Poorly written. The facts given are only partially supported. I'm vegetarian myself, and I have been for well over 10 years now, but I felt like this book was just angry vegans trying to push their beliefs on everyone else."
1,Disappointing,"I thought this would be a funny book about being overweight or losing weight, but all it was was crap trying to convert you to a vegan!!! Very disappointing....."
1,PETA Propaganda,"This book is little more than PETA propaganda combined with randomly chosen, poorly researched ""facts"" and a lot of conflicting ideas and information. Overall not worth the read."
1,Vegan only,"So, this book has a lot good information, and I like the way they ""tell it like it is"". But if I had known it was about being vegan, and animal cruelty, I wouldn't have bought it. I am fairly knowledgable about food (and where it comes from), and I own farm animals, so I know that some of their info is questionable. I agree that if you follow it, you will lose weight. But if you want to still eat meat, PLEASE buy it local, from someone that practices humane treatment and don't buy this book."
1,"Some tips good, however some very unhealthy ---","Eating soy on a daily basis can be damaging to your health. Soy is the Number 2 estrogen-producing food source - it makes your body fatter. All women become estrogen-dominant at some point, and wonder why their health has gone south and why they have gained weight that is impossible to lose. This is simply pure science.Also, it has been documented that vegans end up with certain vitamin deficiencies. Please do your research and be responsible for your own health. All that glitters isn't gold."
1,Vulgar,I should have guessed by the title that this book would be very crude. I would not recommend it to anyone.
1,dieting,"strongly dislike the vocabulary being used and the ""lack of sensitivity"" - not everybody was born to be vegetarian and would suggest to use more scientifically based evidenced when providing the nutritional information."
1,Dissapointed,"Completely dissapointed. The title might as well been, Become a Vegan or you are not worthy."
4,Good for a person interested on the basics,"I found that the book was a good, quick read for those beginner vegans. My husband ,a devote meat eater, told me that it wasn't a matter of if but a matter of when he became a vegan. He couldn't believe some of the stories of how the meat was processed and it actually made me sick. I don't even eat meat. It did contain vulgur language but I guess in this day and age it didn't really faze me."
1,Life Threatening Advice: STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!,"As a medical doctor, and a surgeon, I am terrified by the information in this book. The information in this book will, simply, harm you and kill you. I am not kidding. They have made advice on taking several herbal supplements and colonic cleanses that can threaten your health. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. The authors credentials do not allow them to give this type of nutritional and/or medical advice. DANGER!!!"
3,Language needs to lose fat,"Not a bad story to tell, eat well, exercise often, don't give up...but its a hard language sale and I don't need to be denigrated into doing the right thing."
5,From a meat eater: EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS,"This book is a combination of dietary advice and information. It is like the Farenheit 9-11 of food books. Some people seem to try to write this book off as being just for vegans. Why? Are vegans the only people who would want to know how healthy or unhealthy their food is?As a meat eater, I thank the authors for putting this book out. I pride myself on being fairly informed, but this book's research was excellent. Both entertaining and informative, Skinny Bitch is a great read. It has definitely changed my perspective on being thin, the food industry, and my lifestyle. Am I going to be a vegan from now on? No. But I'm going to be much healthier.If I become skinny, I'll update my review. :) For now, I've lost 6 pounds this month!If you don't like learning and can't think for your self, DON'T READ THIS BOOK."
2,"Veganism, not dieting - but with attitude","This book isn't about being skinny - it's about being an organic vegan which will make you healthy (and therefore skinny). There is barely any space devoted to dieting concepts like ""exercise"", ""portion control"", or other popular diets. Most of the book focuses on the evils (and they are evil) of factory farming and the meat industries. The writing style is exactly as they describe it - ""No holds barred"", almost to the point of being offensive. The book references a lot of books, but some of the arguments are just weak. I'd recommend ""The Secrets of Skinny Chicks"" if you want a diet book and another book with more facts, less attitude if you want a book about veganism."
2,"Not for the ""real world"" eaters","Although this book is informative, it's not helpful to anyone who ever wants to eat red meat, white meat, fish, eggs, dairy, sweetners, etc., etc., ever again. This book isn't about moderation, it's about NEVER eating the items listed above. I don't live in a vegan world, therefore it wasn't very helpful to me at all."
1,"Should be called ""Skinny Judgemental Vegan Bitch""","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you are even remotely interested in learning about adopting a healthy lifestyle through the use of a healthy balanced diet and exercise. DO BUY THIS BOOK if you are interested in learning about becoming a vegan, enjoy dramatic conspiracy theories about the US food industry and government, and like being called a fat ass.I am completely disgusted that I wasted my money on this terrible collaboration of half-facts and total fabrication. In short, these two `skinny bitches' who have absolutely NO medical background or schooling, proceed to push their PETA agenda to unsuspecting readers who are simply interested in learning new ways to lose weight.THIS IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT BECOMING SKINNY! This is a book about the meat and dairy industry. I am getting my money back."
2,Not Helpful,"There was not a lot of helpful weight loss information in this book. I thought there would be more information on eating healthy, but it was actually about living a vegan lifestyle and bashing people that eat meat and dairy. I was disappointed to say the least."
1,Disappointed,"Wish I had read the reviews here before purchasing. Then I would have known it was not so much a self-help diet/exercise book as it was a book about how everyone should not eat meat. I didn't finish the book. Don't recommend it. Instead, Read: You! On A Diet, at least that gives some practical advice."
1,Don't buy it....,unless you enjoy reading lots of cussing and want to become a vegan. I cuss and this book offended me. I also do not plan on becoming vegan.
1,"If this is what it means to be a skinny b*tch, I don't want to be one","Wow. Talk about false advertising! Nowhere on the cover, nor on the back, nor in the first few chapters that folks will usually browse (either in a store or on amazon) is the word 'vegan' even mentioned. The crassness of the first couple of chapters was pretty entertaining, but then it just gets more and more extreme from there...If I had known that the book was a poorly argued piece of militant vegan trash, I definately wouldn't have bought it. I guess it's my own fault for not reasearching first.ALSO: About the ""masters degree"" one of them has in holistic nutrition - in interviews she admits it was a correspondance course. If you are interested in the subjects in the book, save your money and read something by someone with a real degree."
5,It works!,"This book is amazing and hilarious! These two women know exactly what they're saying and they properly name the sources. Not only it's terrible and cruel what happens in factory farms (and it's true), but this kind of diet really makes you a skinny bitch.I personally followed their advice and I look greater than ever, feel healthier than ever. I feel light and energetic.This is for life, no fad diet. This is a lifestyle that helps ourselves, animals and the planet. But it's presented with a great sense of humor.Good luck to everybody, keep losing that extra pounds!"
4,Hilarious!,"This book keeps it real! While it does push a vegetarian lifestyle, it is packed with shocking information. If you aren't a vegetarian at the end of this book, you have a stomach of steel."
3,Great thought starter.. but meat lovers beware!,"Although this novel is hailed as a new weight loss method, book buyers beware- Skinny Bitches is written by two vegans and most of the book focuses on the health risks of eating meat, poultry, dairy products and even seafood. There are definitely some very compelling arguments made with a lot of research to back them up- but I can definitely say giving up chicken is not an option for me! Other food/lifestyle changes mentioned make sense but they are few and far between the overall 'become a vegan' message.On another note- I like the direct Dr. Phil-like approach Kim and Rory take with their tips to readers- but FYI - as the title Skinny Bitch predicts- there is an excessive use of curse words throughout. Overall I'd recommend this book to someone who is considering becoming vegan or someone who needs to take drastic measures with their food intake for health reasons."
4,Interesting read,"This was quite a thought provoking book. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the language and sometimes patronizing tone. It was getting old and mostly unnecessary to get your attention and or point across. Still a great read whether you are or are not considering going Vegan or Vegetarian. I have been on the edge of being a Vegetarian; this book confirms it would be a solid decision. I have never understood the whole dairy and milk obsession. Cows milk is just disgusting, why would grown humans drink it. As hard as it was to read about the mistreatment of dumb animals, I am glad I did. It is a shame that more people have not taken up the causes of these poor mistreated animals. Every time I flounder I am going to pull out this book and re-read some segments to reaffirm my choice to change my eating and standard of living."
5,Best book ever!,"I don't take the time to write many reviews. I felt like I should for this book to let anyone who is thinking about this book TO BUY IT ALREADY!I swear these women took the words right out of my mouth and grabbed a bunch of my feelings and said, ""yea, we feel like that too."" I keep saying ""Amen!"" and ""F*** yeah!"" when they get going on a rampage about all the crap people eat.If you're already a vegetarian or vegan you will get such a kick out of this book. If you are a big meat and dairy eater be prepared to be called names......but it's all for the better. If you feel it's a scare tactic, it would be a good idea to research some of the information.One more thing. This book is just so empowering! It makes me believe I do have a voice and can help out in the world. It hasn't just given me a good laugh but a really good reminder that I can be in control of my health."
3,"funny, but true","Witty, funny and to the point. However, for a diet book the ranting on the slaughterhouses and meat was a bit excessive and boring. The suggested ""new"" foods were good ones though, and I would buy this book for the humor and good recommendations in the back."
2,Propaganda for Veganism,"Positive comments: The book is pretty informative about the American meat and animal farming industry, though some of the info is significantly out of date.Negative comments: The book touts veganism as the best way to be skinny and healthy. Exercise is mentioned in maybe one sentence in the entire thing. So unless you are thinking of becoming vegan and want some convincing to put you over the edge, this book may not be the best choice."
1,vegan diet???,Stupid. It basically tells you the only way to lose weight is to eat vegan and eat organic. There is nothing nutritionally sound about that logic and tries to turn the reader off meat by talking about slaughter houses. Yes we should eat more wholesome foods but you don't have to become vegan to reach that goal.
2,Vegan living by authors with no credentials,"I enjoyed the first third of this book, until it became clear that it was not a lifestyle plan, unless that lifestyle was to live as a vegan. While I applaud people who are able to make this commitment, the authors should say so up front rather than presenting their book as something chick lit that Bridget Jones would buy, which is why millions of us (myself included) fell for it. As to the language, I am known to have a salty tongue myself from time to time because I am a grown-up, but swearing just because one can is neither clever nor witty. One attack on the dairy industry begins by stating I should find my mother and nurse, but in a much cruder fashion. The authors have no credentials to be giving any nutritional advice and some of their statements are blatant falsehoods. If one is squeamish, do not read the chapter on how animals are slaughtered. I never finished this book and sold it on Amazon, hopefully to someone who liked it more than I did."
2,They kiss with those mouths?,"The authors I once thought were beautiful became hideously ugly to me within the first 5 pages of this book. Their arrogance has led them to believe they can say ANYTHING and the masses will lap up their words. WRONG! I bought the book because I want straight talk from people who live the life I want. However, I'm now tempted to write a book for those like them called Skin Deep: Your Looks Aren't Everything"
1,Are you for real?,"I appreciate the fact that there actually is some good sound advice in this book but the dramatic antics about the meat industry and the marketing of prepackaged food as holistic is a bit off.In a nutshell.......If you want a realistic approach to weight loss that includes a healthy balance in your life this book is not for you.If you are willing to live a vegan lifestyle and have access to a slew of orangic foods like ""fake tuna"", and you don't mind being cursed at then you may actually like the book. The cursing in this book goes past humorous or emphasizing a point to being down right vulgar - down right rude (NO CLASS). Get real!"
2,Skinny B**@^& Have Potty Mouths!!,"I liked the book, I was surprised by all the foul language, and sometimes offended. Most of the content was good. I did not realize when I bought the book it was about becoming a Vegan- NO MEAT, DAIRY, EGGS. If the Vegan lifestyle is not for you then save your money!"
2,Disappointing to the Mature Reader,"The OVER-use of bad language in this book became monotonous and eventually insulting. I concur that strong language, strategically placed here and there, can add humor to a serious subject. But to endure a continuing barrage of this language page after page after page is demeaning. The content was informative and convincing but it was difficult to take any of it seriously when there were 2 to 3 to 4 ""swear words"" on every page. Even though I was interested in the well-researched facts I put the book down after a few chapters and have no intentions of picking it back up in the near future."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"And yet somehow I failed to do so. I believe that failure can be summed up in one word: profanity! If in fact the authors are the intelligent thoughtful women that they claim to be they would be able to express a coherent argument without calling me & everyone else who thinks differently vulgar names. I believe, as many people have argued, that there is some good stuff in this book. Yet I cannot bring myself to wade through the sea of filth to find it. It is going back !"
1,"If I could, I would have given it zero stars","After seeing this on a list of 'must reads' on Shape Magazine's website, I took the book out of the library... thank God I didn't buy it! On the very first page of chapter one, the comment 'healthy = skinny, unhealthy = fat' numbed my mind to any helpful health tips that I might have gleaned from its pages. Please don't waste your time, if you want to get healthy, some excellent books I can highly recommend are: Thin for Life by Anne M. Fletcher, Shape Your Life: 4 Weeks to a Better Body-and a Better Life by Barbara Harris, The Step Diet by James O. Hill, and The Sonoma Diet by Connie Guttersen and Stephanie Karpinske."
2,"Sketchy science, lots of ranting","This book surprised me in a lot of ways. I was expecting sort of a sassy, here's-how-you-SHOULD diet book with lots of advice for cutting calories. It reads a lot more like a pro-vegan, anti-government rant. They go after several government agencies for things like approving artificial sweeteners. While I have no problem with these viewpoints, it just came as a shock from a diet book. The science also reads as a little sketchy. They advocate eating zero processed food, but then recommend fake processed ""meat"". There are also a lot of horror stories about the processing and slaughter of animals in America. There was no information that came as a surprise, but I was not expecting that from this book."
1,Horrible book,"I borrowed this book from my library and returned it the same day. The authors are very blunt, that's for sure. But as other reviewers have stated, it seems that all they did was bash meat eaters and those who didn't eat Au natural. I don't believe in animal abuse, but I will continue to eat my meat (and use my Splenda)!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Under the guise of being a diet book, it soon became apparent that these two authors were trying to scare people into becoming vegans (and brother if this book doesn't do it, nothing will!) Using disgusting descriptions of the animal industry (laced with filthy language,) and some inaccurate information and accusations about artifical sweeteners, etc., I am ready to eat just water and lettuce (although I am sure they have some reservations about that too!). The book was so gross that I couldn't finish it!"
1,not what I expected at all!,"I really thought this was a book about the commonsense of eating healthy, not a rant and rav about being vegan. I've heard so much propaganda from the vegan world I don't believe any of it now. There are ethical animal farms and ranches. The book started out great in talking about the horrors of processed food, which I believe is the root of our national obesity, but I quickly lost interest when 75% of the book was only about cruelty in animal slaughterhouses.The cover, title and book description are a gimic to get you to read the book. What a waste of time."
1,Waste of money and time,"This book is a misleading waste of time. I couldn't get past half way through and that was only by making myself keep reading. Why the ""f"" word is needed is beyond me. This is not really about getting skinny, staying skinny or anything else of that nature. This book is about bashing the cattle industry, the dairy industry and anything that doesn't have to do with being a vegan. Whoop tee doo!!! They need to just say up front that they hate people who eat anything except vegatables and fruits and that we are going to burn hell along with anyone who has anything to do with the food industry.. except that is the organic vegatabally fruity industry... WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!"
1,Not what the book claims... left feeling ripped off and mislead,"I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN RIPPED OFF AND MISLEAD! If you are readying this book based on the claim, ""A no-nonsense, tough-love guide for savvy girls who want to stop eating crap and start looking fabulous!"" and hope to learn what these authors consider ""crap"" you will be disappointed. This is a book written by vegetarians to push their agenda on those that eat meat. They use tactics to ensure you are completely disgusted by the meat industry. I'm not saying what they say isn't true, I'm convinced it is. But, don't pretend to offer advise to a group of people (fat people) that are looking for help and then flip the script and make the book about some political argument against meat. This makes you ""skinny ... "" no different than the meat industry and FDA that aren't looking out for us, neither are you."
2,Ok information but not worth $10,"Yes, it is straight forward talk about all the chemicals in food and what we should avoid. The two women are a funny but it gets a little tiresome after the first 20 pages. However, it is very unrealistic for those on a budget with kids and not interested in vegan way. This book is good for those who are interested in this life style and should be promoted that way, as a vegan life style change. There are other books and magazines that I found to be more useful in achieving the a balance diet, good exercise plan, motivation and healthy food choices. If you really want the full affect, read the book and do the workout CD. They never do anything remotely close making you break a sweat, maybe because they don't have enough body fat to produce energy!"
1,"Vulgar, anti-woman, and not really accurate","This book is vulgar possibly just to get our attention. It offends my non-delicate ear/eye. After raising 4 teen agers, no language can shock me, no slang references to body parts, functions, and processes can be news. Still, the authors, in their repetitive way, irritated me with their constant use of George Carlin's 7 words. And the message is not surprisingly degrading to women. The chapter title ""Don't be a Pussy"", for example. Could it be possible that non-skinny, meat-eating women are good people too?It did not make me laugh. Too bad they f$%&*-ed up an important vegan message and information about cruelty to animals with this trashy presentation."
2,In chapter 3 so far,"I'm on the fence with this one. I understand the tough love approach the girls are going for, however, they go to far with the swearing. I don't think real women, classy women feel the need to curse this much to ""keep it real"" as the saying goes. Not sure who these women are writing for. I'm also not entirely sure they haven't exaggerated some of their facts in order to scare girls into giving up everything. I for one cannot give up coffee. True, I may be addicted but I also just really like coffee. Hmm..."
4,"Excellent advise, excessive language","I loved reading this book & have recommended it to several friends who also rave about it. I don't agree with all of their advise, I believe there are ways to circumvent the bad things in meat products without giving them up entirely. I do feel that the authors go overboard with the cursing & vulgarity. I always warn my friends of this before they start to read it. Otherwise, definitely an excellent book. Would recommend to anyone interested in healthy eating."
2,Beware: Graphic descriptions of meat industry,"I am completely against the way meat is raised in our country.I also felt completely ambushed by the graphic descriptions of slaughter and cruelty that appear in this book. I agree that the industry needs a complete overhaul, but I think she's manipulating the reader through shock alone.Just know what you're getting when you pick up this book with its clever gimmick of a title."
4,"Get over it, people, it's a good book!","I've been vegan for over a year now and I can honestly say I've never done a better thing for my body. I grabbed this book on a whim to see what it had to say about vegetarianism/veganism and was pleasantly surprised to see that was the main focus of the book. Forget the bad language and insults, people-- it's just a marketing strategy (and, judging from the fact this is a New York Times bestseller, an effective one). It's not like they were talking to YOU. Sheesh. Anyway, I don't agree with some of what they say (like fasting). But still, most of the information in there is very good. When it comes to health, I say learn about EVERYTHING to do with nutrition and the food industry and MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF. You don't have to blindly follow this (or any) diet/lifestyle plan. Read this with an open mind and you'll definitely find ways to improve your life."
5,This book is not for wimps,"I've been struggling to shed those last 10 pounds forever and kick my dairy ""habit"". After reading this book (2 weeks ago), I have lost 4 pounds very effortlessly and my diet is healthier than ever. If you want to be mollycoddled into thiness you'll stay fat forever. Yes, the truth is sometimes inconvenient."
1,So Disappointing,"The title was so fun, I was really expecting a good read. I was hoping for some tips on how to not eat as much crap as I do, and have a good time doing it. However, the book quickly digressed into a polemic on veganism, and steamrolled every possible food lifestyle except veganism. In the most crass, vulgar and gratuitously obscene language I have ever read.The ""science"" provided was so coarsely discussed and in many cases put forth in such a dismissive manner that I felt zero credibility from the authors, who as it turns out do have very little credibility other than their own enormous egos.There was no real knowledge about how to overcome bad food habits other than to get over them, somehow.As soon as I read the book, I had a big serving of Oreo cookies and a tall glass of milk just to kill the bad taste in my mouth. And I am completely not kidding. It is the only diet book that made me want to eat worse than I do already!"
3,Very informative,"The book had a lot of great information about how meat and poultry is processed and the damage that a lot of foods can do to your system over time, however, it was a little too organic based for me. It offers a complete lifestyle change to eating whole and organic foods, which is possible, but in reality is too costly to make me switch completely. It is full of ideas for making small changes."
1,Misleading!!!!,"This book has got to be one of the most misleading books ever!! It is basically propoganda for veganism. They should have titled the book ""Skinny Vegan Bitch"" because that is what this book is about! Don't eat meat but hey, why don't you eat fake meat!! I don't have a problem with veganism but if the whole point of being a vegan is eating non animal products, why do they create ""fake"" meat or cheese? If veganism is so great, why does one need to be tricked into eating something? Food is what it is. Don't call it ""fake"" turkey, call it a tofu patty!! Obviously there is something missed. I will take responsibility for not being an informed consumer and researching what this book was about, but this was an impulse buy. The book does contains some good suggestions, but is an unrealistic and unaffordable diet for a college student. Until it is cheaper to eat vegan than to eat ""real"" meat, then this diet is not practical."
1,Possibly the Worst Lifestyle Book Ever Written,"When two undereducated, over-opinionated, and inexcusably vulgar socialist vegan conspiracy theorists get together to write a diet book, this is the result. This book is 50% political manifesto, 49% baseless opinion, and 1% fact. It sounds like most of the nutritional information they are passing along as fact has been gleaned from PETA brochures, and they discount years of scientific research in the health field. Any research data that does not fit into their very narrow (and, I might interject, UN-expert) opinion is explained away as a vast governmental conspiracy. And the language is ridiculously vulgar. I felt like I needed to wash my eyes out with soap halfway through the book."
2,Ignorant,"Some of the advise in this book is solid~drink water, limit alcohol, don't smoke, but the language was vulgar to say the least. I know sailors that sound like angels compaired to these two. In the beginning the swearing was tolerable, but page after page after page the language becomes grating.They sound completely ignorant and sadly this detracts from the message they are trying to impart. I understand how the government is in the bed with the meat and dairy industry...and I understand how inhumane slaughter houses are. But again, it is told like a rebellious teen ager. Clean it up ladies...you sound like idiots!"
3,Wow... just exactly what I thought it was...,"No misrepresenting in the title. They are definitiely going to give it to you straight. I have found, due mainly to this book, that I do not do well with the straight-forward attack (come on... I haven't done well with any so far). I'm sure loads of people will find this honest approach more than helpful, but I am not one of them. I bought this book in a rare moment of pre-new-year weekness. I know that I am too darn stubborn to take a brow-beating from two skinny you-know-whats who tell you exactly what you already know and choose to ignore anyway. As an indirect result from skimming through this book I suddenly felt very empowered and strongly and quickly pushed it under my bed to lie with the dust-bunnies and miss-matched socks. I can say it worked for me... I lost 5 pounds just trying to prove it wrong... probably would've lost double that with the book... darn my stubborness."
3,Very Informative,"This book is pretty good,however based on the cover, I thought the book was based on alot of dieting tactics. I was a little unhappy to learn after reading the book that it's sole goal is to promote being a vegetarian. I did however find this information educational,but I was looking for more than that."
1,"love yourself, skip this book","These authors give all vegans a bad name. If the purpose of this book was to get more people to go vegan, they've accomplished exactly the oposite. The foul language I could deal with, but they demean the reader at every turn. I became a vegan because it teaches compassion for all life. These women will only succeed in giving overweight women a terrible case of low self esteem, never a motivation to make a positive lifestyle change. Not to mention the fact that their diet plan verges on starvation, extremely dangerous in the hands of teen girls, or any of the ten million women in this country with eating disorders. Avoid this book like the plague. There are plenty of credible vegan sources of education."
1,very unhealthy,"there should be a warning on the back in bold red letters ""may lead to an eating disorder"" the advise in this book pretty much sets up any desperate person for anorexia. the limitations on the varies of healthy foods like meat milk vegetables and friuts. i will admit i bought into the ridiculous advise in the book but after a week i realized these girls are insan and dangerous and i hope no one takes their advise seriously these girls are ineducated and preaching illogical things they have thought up into a way that convinces readers everyone who does not eat A vegan and completely organic diet will develope cancer"
2,Things I wish I knew before I bought the book...,"Well I have to say, the book for the most part was fascinating, but I really wish I knew it was written by vegans before buying it and the sister book, Skinny Bitch in the Kitch... I am going to return both of them. While they have some great information, 1/3 of the book is very angry... Basically telling you you are a horrible person for eating a burger on occasion. While they offer a lot of support why not to eat meat, you can tell most of it is their personal opinion. I agree slaughter houses are horrible, but I really didn't need to read a chapter about it. Move on, find a different book. You already know most of the information in there... You don't need some authors cussing every few words to explain it. Its too bad I was really excited about the book."
1,I guess I'm a moron,"The author notes that only a moron will think they can lose weight on the Atkins Diet... I must be a moron then, since I've lost 40lbs with it and have kept it off for 6 months and counting so far."
3,Kind of slow and a little bit of bullying..,"I think the authors make great points about eating correctly but they have to remember, we're all human, we have cravings and there's nothing wrong with indulging. They come off as bullies in a world where there are people of different shapes and sizes and we shouldn't let the idea of having everyone look exactly the same be the norm."
1,Misleading!,"I liked the book in the beginning, until they abruptly changed it into a pro-vegan lifestyle book. I think these chicks are just ghostwriters working for PETA. I recommend ""Naturally Thin"" by Bethenny Frankel."
5,Great Book!,This book was GREAT! Surprisingly I have completely changed my diet and I needed this book to motivate me to make the change!
3,Read with caution,"This is a good and very educational book with interesting humor. However, if you enjoy eating meat and want to continue doing so, DO NOT READ chapter 6!!! I haven't been able to eat meat since and that was the effect they were going for! Other than that one chapter it was a very good read."
1,crude and vulgar,"I should have known with a title like Skinny Bitch that the book might be crap. However, I was expecting a light hearted approach to dieting, not a crude and vulgar rant. These authors are rude and demeaning. If you value yourself at all, do NOT buy this book."
1,Not healthy.,"This is not a healthy way to eat, vegan or not. While I'm all for tough love on weight loss, this book makes you feel bad about eating...anything. I also don't appreciate picking up a ""weight loss"" book and being spooned a bunch of opinions on the government and the treatment of animals.I don't recommend this book to anyone, not even bitches who are already skinny."
1,Nothing more than a platform for a vegan and polictal tirade,"I was so angry when I was done reading this book I wanted to return it. #1 it has nothing that I could feasibly apply to my life, except maybe cutting out diet soda. #2 it made me mad that they go on and on about the meat and poultry industry and the corruption of government. Nothing more than a platform for a vegan and political tirade."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"Like many people have already said, this book is nothing but pure vegan propaganda, designed to brainwash people who are easily bowled over by the mere mention of a study that sounds remotely scientific. They try to ""science-up"" their own views on veganism, but their ""scientific support"" is nothing but fluff, if you check out their sources. No peer reviewed journals to back them up in sight. It is nothing but two foul-mouthed vegan chicks' attempt to persuade others to be like them (a little cult-like, in my opinion). My advice--don't be sucked into their autocratic nonsense and make up your own mind; don't let them make up your mind for you.I felt like I totally wasted my money. Usually I can find some redeeming qualities about products I buy. . . but not this one."
1,Wrong Title,"The title of this book should be, ""The Rantings of Skinny Bitches"". This is not helpful to someone who wants to lose weight. This is helpful to someone who wants to completely adopt a vegan lifestyle. The book is just an emotional tantrum of profanity meant to imitate tough love, and not helpful to real women. If the authors are examples of women vegans - please count me out."
5,Awesome read,"I loved it. I read it twice, and I'm reading it again. I smiled all the way through and now I'm a vegan for life.Thanks Rory and Kim"
5,made me a vegan!,"This book solidified my desire to switch from vegetarian to vegan, and I've never looked back. I'm thrilled with my new diet and my new lifestyle. I don't like the profanity, but it's their style. If you can ignore it, the message is important. I have a friend who lost nearly 20 pounds after reading this book and going vegan. I, too, have been healthier and lost weight. It's great for those thinking about veg or vegan diets or those who just want to lose weight."
4,Even if you're not a Vegan - fun,I'm not a Vegan but it's still nice to read alternative perspectives especially when they're put in such an irreverent form. I enjoyed Skinny Bitch but more as I'd enjoy reading the ravings of a controversial politically active comedian. Not that I agree with their viewpoint but that I can appreciate their wit and cynicism.
4,To the point!,"This is a great book despite all the vulgarity, which in part makes the reading hilariously entertaining. Skinny Bitch is packed full of information. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that the authors seem to think the government is trying to sabotage our food supply. Maybe they are correct, but the manner in which some of this information is written seemed biased. However, if you think for yourself and stop being a moron, you'll enjoy the book and get the message Rory and Kim are trying to get across! :)"
2,Good Info but kinda rude...,"I would recommend John Robbin's ""May All Be Fed"" over this. Although not as recent, he teaches about healing ourselves as part of the bigger picture of healing the world. Skinny B promotes the negativity and self absorbtion that is far too rampant in our culture."
1,Don't buy!,"If i wanted to be a veggie I would have bought a book about that. The book isn't really funny, they just swear a lot which makes me feel like a 13 year old wrote this."
1,Below Par,"After reading the Kindle Sample, I decided this book was one of the worse books I have every read. Very degrading to the reader, unless you are in Junior High School and dont mind being beaten up by the ""popular"" kids.I also read many of the reviews and I can not figure for the life of me, how this book was a ""New York Top Seller"". Is being skinny so important? Let me be a Bitch, and say, I would not recommend this book, not even for my dog."
2,Wow...what a political book!!,"While I do think the book had some very good points regarding nutrition, and I did get a ""kick"" out of the salty language used, I was not expecting the political rants that every chapter eventually turned into. I was looking for a book that was ""frank"" about weight loss and nutrition, not a book about how cruel and stupid meat eaters are. Had I known about the political agenda behind the book, I would have passed."
2,Annoying,"Having had a healthy diet most of my life, I find books like this rather annoying because they present yet another fad to the ever-present dieting craze of our society. It's actually quite simple but we're too caught up in the absolutes... there is no absolute. Just eat less and balance out the types of things you put in your mouth! However, I do understand there's a need to re-coach our worlds so if you need a guide of this sort, dump ""Skinny Bitch"" and go with ""French Women Don't Get Fat""...."
1,no new information,"This is book is full of information which could be read in such book as""a diet for a new america"". I like straight forward information. If the authors think they are so funny they should take it on the road. I personally found the information outdated and the form sophomoric."
1,A call to arms rather than a diet book,"This book has very little to do with dieting and much more to do with attacking the ranching industries and promoting a vegan lifestyle. It attempts to gross the reader out with images of eating ""carcasses"" and sucking on your mother's breast in order to convince the reader that meat and any of its byproducts are unhealthy. This book is a bait and switch and a complete waste of time and money. If I wanted a book on the politics of the meat industry, I would have bought one."
4,Four stars for intention,"As an author, I think this book is poorly written. These women need a thesauras to switch out all those curse words. However, as a vegetarian looking for motivation to become a vegan, I love to see that a book like this has gained so much popularity. Eating a plant-based diet truly is the best way to prevent cancer, which is a statistic from the American Cancer Society. I like all the resources in the book but it's definitely a fluffy, quick read."
2,Can I Have My Reading Time Back?,"OK, I got this book from [...] (so don't think I purchased it) because I'd heard several people talking about it (Oprah, The View, Online blogs, etc). I figured it was worth the book credit to see what these chicks were talking about...NOT! First, they use way too much cursing in attempts to share their views. Second, they believe that eating meat is from the devil (I want to be healthy but preaching vegetarian isn't the way). Third, they demean people that may be overweight throughout the book and try to apologize on the last page (give me a break). They do offer a few interesting statistics, websites, and recipe sites that can be used in combination with what you already use. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my Sunday."
1,Misleading and Dangerous,"Without even looking, anyone with any knowledge of nutrition would know that this book is written by two models who, in fact, are skinny bitches. The book is full of half-truths and lies. There's just enough truth to lure people in and then the lies can be dangerous to their health. These women have sited documents they used for research and used information out of context to support their own views. While following their advice will get you skinny, it will NOT get you healthy. This book is dangerous if read for anything other than entertainment value."
1,Dean Ornish with a potty mouth,"I thought this would be an informative interesting discussion of being a vegan, but it was a redo of the Dean Ornish type diet with tons of foul language, which was not necessary and a total turn off. If that is what not eating a cheeseburger will do to you, I say get over to Chili's and have one, with fries. There was nothing new or interesting in this book and their ""science"" was questionable. They covered this over by using profanity to describe anyone who thinks differently. If you must read, borrow from the library so you won't feel like you were cheated out of your money."
4,Tough Love,"I Liked this book. It is hard-core but factual. I think it is straight forward, and to the point. Try it!"
4,Not what I expected,"I was really expecting a book that taught you a healthy way of eating, which it does, but I did not expect to learn all of the horrible facts about animal abuse. There should be a warning on the label that if you read this book you could become a vegetarian. I am so grossed out now that I don't even want my family eating meat or dairy products. So beware, you will be converted if you read this book."
3,Eh. Good for information.,"This book is FULL of very useful information, but, I'm not sold on some of the drastic ideas and they don't offer much for those who aren't willing to give up meat and dairy and become a vegan. I am very happy I bought this book because it did open my eyes to some less drastic things I have been eating and I'm more than willing to remove from my diet and life. This book is a good reference guide."
2,"Get Inspired and not ""Beat Up""","I personally do not find the language in the book to be inspiring, and believe that it can be harmful to a person's self-esteem which is the cornerstone of successful weight management. You can call it what you like, but it is still a ""Die-It"" when you are expected to give up foods that you love. If you want to get inspired instead of put down or beat up, check outLose The Diet: Transform Your Body By Connecting With Your Soul."
4,Meat-lovers beware,"I do appreciate the message of this book, but did not realize that the diet program was going to be vegetarian. I think you should know before buying this book that they are quite anti-meat, so if you are like me and enjoy lean protein such as chicken or fish, just take this book with a grain of salt. Otherwise, this book is very entertaining and motivating. It gave me a healthy does of fear for processed food and diet soda, which is probably what I need."
3,"Sassy, good advice, but I can't give up steaks","I loved the hilarious turns of phrase in this book and the coarse language. It does sound like the fun, confident girlfriend who tells it like it is. But when I bought it, I had no intention of becoming a vegetarian, let alone a vegan! I think others have noted similar. But overall, it's so easy to read (MINUS the SLAUGHTERHOUSE PARTS! OH LORDY JESUS), that I kept with it more than any other diet book I've tried. It's just kind of a wake-up call about all the gross food that we all eat and expect to be skinny. It made me more aware of what I eat, and that's a good thing."
4,Fun to read,"Overall, it was a fun read. I couldn't put it down, I was amused with how Freedman and Barnouin described the evils of eating sugar, meat, and overprocessed foods. Although I do not agree with everything they write, it is worth reading. This book is a good resource for vegans primarily, but there's something in this book for anyone who wants to eat healthy and understand why certain types of food aren't healthy."
4,Light reading,"I thought the book was hilarious...I couldn't put it down. I don't know a whole lot about being a vegetarian/vegan and didn't realize that was the intent of the book when I bought it. There is a lot of profanity, but it's funny and shouldn't be taken personally. Reading the book definitely makes you think about what you are eating and though I was gung-ho to become a vegan after reading it I haven't really taken any steps to do so."
1,Rude. Poorly written. Don't waste your money.,"I really, really, really love books that are about to tough-love you into action. This ain't it.This book isn't tough love, it's just rude. And it's not motivating because it has no real convincing science to sway your opinion.If you're someone who is typically motivated by being verbally abused, then this book is for you.If you also like to be dazzled with interesting facts that lead to logical conclusions... you can skip this crap.Just plain awful. I wish I could get my money back as a matter of general principle."
4,nice read,"It has good information (sometimes the authors tend to digress in depth with certain topics though) on eating well, recipes that are inspiring and all around an easy read."
5,loveee,One of my favorite books ever! But....I didnt stick to this 'diet plan' for too long haha..although I do agree with a lot of the info here...I think if you stick to it..you'll definitely lose weight..I excluded a bunch of stuff from my diet and lost 15 lbs in a month :)
5,Great Book,This is a great book! A real straight-forward book on what you eat and how it effects your body! I absolutely love it!
5,Good Book!!!,Because this book help me with my job and is very interesting when talk about our health and our life!!!
5,Instant Classic with a Fun Name,"I have re-read Skinny Bitch many times! It is filled with a ton of information presented in a tough love fashion. You may not implement all of the recommendations (for many it would be a drastic diet change), but will come away with more awareness."
5,Very informative,I haven't eaten meat for a little over a year now and i don't miss it. After reading this book I can not call myself vegan. This book is very informative and is an eye opener.
3,It works,"I'm extremely new to soldering and wiring so I'm not gonna spend a bunch of money on a ""quality"" soldering iron, this one was cheap and included free Amazon Prime shipping so why not? This iron works like it is supposed to, the stand is kind of silly and doesn't necessarily hold the iron all the time depending upon how the cord is placed (you should probably secure the cord). The tip isn't the best, it worked like a charm at first but after a few days (and yes I cleaned it lol) but it just barely works now, and I plan on soldering/de-soldering SMD 0603 LED's to an xbox 360 controller board, so I'm gonna get a new tip at radioshack.all in all, if you don't like it, it's only 8 bucks... It works.and also the plastic parts of the iron do get warm closer to the tip, but not enough to hurt you, if its making you uncomfortable, use gloves lol."
3,Cheap but works.,"The iron I received did not look like the one pictured, and had a plastic based stand instead of a steel one. Mine has a cheap black plastic handle that gets quite hot near the upper portion, so you can only hold the lower 2/3rds of the handle. The tip is came with was not very good either. Once I replaced the tip with a cheapo one from Radio Shack, it worked fine though. It also has a very short 3' cord. But on the plus side, the cord is soft and flexible so it doesn't pull the iron around if you nudge it.It's cheap, it works."
5,Love it!,Heats up fast and gets way hot! Seems to have a pretty durable tip. Good for tiny applications. I changed changed about 50 LEDS on xbox 360 items and it worked great. These leds are tiny!!! I would recommend to anyone.
4,"Works, but has a soft tip","This unit heats up fairly fast, which is about all you can expect of a soldering iron, but the tip is very soft. The tip curled over on the second resistor I removed. Not a tragedy, but be prepared to buy more tips in short order."
2,30 Watt Iron,"You get what you pay for and not a penny more. It is good to get the job done, one job done. If you plan on using it for other jobs down the road then spend the couple bucks more and get the Weller one. I did after I used this one a couple times and like the Weller much better."
1,Junk,The side of the tip eroded into a crescent shape during the first hours of use. I threw it out.
3,Very Basic,This is your basic cheap-o iron. Plug it in and it gets hot. I have been using it for 3-4 months to do some quick PCB repairs and it does the job.
3,So-so,"I've bought this iron some time ago.Don't expect too much, it's cheap and it works as it costs. I can't say that it's terrible, but it's not great either."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Think Coca-Cola and what comes to mind? That's brand power. Author David A. Aaker illustrates how such powerful brands connect with customers. Unfortunately, Aaker doesn't show you how to build up your name or how to make the most of your ad dollars. But he does provide compelling, insider case studies, going back to the launch of Procter & Gamble's Ivory soap in 1881. Aaker sets three goals and just about achieves them: 1) Show managers how brand equity provides value, 2) Showcase examples of good and bad marketing and 3) Discuss how to manage brand equity. But, while Aaker explains brand equity by listing its components, the correlation between the parts and the whole is not clear - even with the ever-present flow chart. Regardless, being as well-known as IBM would make you tingle, and if you are looking for interesting historical perspective more than practical managerial advice, we [...] recommend this book, particularly to advertising and marketing executives."
4,A very good book that highlights the years '59 to '74.,"The emphasis is placed (as the title states) on the performance cars and engines produced during these years. It gives good accounts of the GTO and Firebird's best years but unlike most books it also covers the full-size Pontiacs as well. Good coverage is found on the Royal cars, the Super Duty engines (including the early '63s) and Pontiac Drag Racing. You'll find many nostalgic photos of hard launches at drag strips and Pontiacs coming together on assembly lines. You'll also find performance numbers srpinkled throughout the book highlighting Pontiac's best engines. An all around fantastic book for the era it covers."
2,Okay if you want a particular slant on understanding,"Stern's book does in journalistic fashion detail some of the ""events"" that have occured recently related to this fuzzy group known as the militia. However I would agree with most other reviewers here that this work proceeds from the desire to further alienate the already alienated and offers little in the way of allowing the reader to understand this phenomena. I'd recommend Dyer's Harvest of Rage for an understanding of this issue."
2,biased,"A decent read. But i have to say this is a biased book. I am personally involved with the Militia Movement here in Wa state and I have to say Stern does damage the militia outlokk and image. He doesnt quite understand why people join a milita and the whole ideology behind it. Just because someone supports limited government, legaliazation of drugs and pro gun doesnt make them unamerican or domestic terrorists. True some may have been a part of a milita and done harm to the public but that is them personally not the grou pthey affiliate with. Perception is key here. This is a decent read from a certain viewpoint. none the less biased.please stern reevaluate what the militia is and why people join them before saying they are racists."
1,Typical unsubstatiated BULL manure...,"I bought this book because I had heard that I was written up in it. Sure enough, there were two different places that I came up in the book. In both places I was ""quoted"" with no source to back up the ""quote"" and all the quotes were total fabrication by either the author or whomever the author used for his ""source"". I was NEVER the head of an un-organized or organized militia in Stevens County, and the only presentation that I did at the Colville Grange was an invocation. Apparently SOMEONE who is pretty liberal is trying to make folks in the public believe something that just is not so. And then of course there is the author who OBVIOUSLY has a bone to pick with anyone who doesn't go along with the status quo of statism and ra ra ra the government loves us retoric that is being shoved down our throats. Too bad some of the ""quotes"" that were attributed to me, didn't actually happen!"
2,Propaganda Fun,"Read this book if you love to read some good ol' propaganda. Actually, I would suggest checking it out at the local library. An interesting experiment would be to read the last chapter first and so on until you've finished with the first one. Don't forget to run around and scream hsyterically after each chapter yelling one of the following phrases: ""Militia members are coming to kill us all"", ""Take my guns, computer, and mind, please"", "" The internet will pollute our minds"", or ""Where is Big Brother? I have the desire to give up some of my rights."" Doing this in a sarcastic voice will earn you extra points. Also, I would not suggest doing this around strangers or in crowded public places."
4,Interesante teoria sobre la Lapida de Palenque,"Este libro esta lleno de datos acerca de la Lapida de Palenque, y una interesante teoria de interpretacion de los grabados que esta tiene. Ademas presenta una propuesta muy particular en cuanto a las manchas solares y la influencia del Sol sobre los llamados ""Signos del Zodiaco"". Solo que yo no lo llamaria ""Las Profecias Mayas"", en realidad no trata sobre las Profecias, con excepcion de alguna referencia puntual."
2,Does not stick well,Tape does not stick well to the skin. Will not hold in place.I do not suggest this product for on the skin purposes.
2,What happened?,"I love Beyoncé and, usually, I find her excellent on stage, but this concert is not good.She lypsinc, and I really don't understand why because she has a wonderful voice.Maybe it's a good concert in general, but it's not as good as what Beyoncé can do."
4,Good show,"She did a great performance with two songs that were not on her album, Fever & Summertime. it was gerat so did it, as a solo artist. I would purchase before the price goes up."
4,"Great Voice, Great Show....Change the outfits!","Let me start off by saying that Beyoncé is my favorite celebrity of ALL TIME! I loved this DVD-CD combo. The remixes on the CD were TERRIBLE! They could've just kept the 3 new songs and left off the remixes.I love the performances on the DVD, but I wish that she would've changed the outfits a little bit more often. The outfit that she used to start of the concert with ""Baby Boy"", was the same outfit that she wore at the VMAs in 2003. She finally changed after about the first 3 or 4 numbers. She changed into a kind of '50s type outfit that was very classy & it had historical meaning. Give about 3 more numbers with that outfit, then she changed into a yellow dress that she wore for about 5 more songs. Then she did ""Dangerously In Love 2"", my favorite performance on the DVD. She wore this spectacular white dress with feathers. Her voice sounded amazing on the entire DVD, but this performance took the prize.Great Voice, Great Show, Buy the DVD!"
4,beyonce fan,i liked beyonce not showing so much flash and really singing most of this concert. not her best concert but enjoyable
3,Lukewarm Performance,"First of all I wanted to let everyone that this is a DVD of Beyonce's first tour as a solo artist. I purchased Beyonce Experience the sametime I purchased Beyonce Live at Wembley.Beyonce is an AMAZING performer!! This DVD is not BAD, but it is NOT better than Beyonce Experience. Beyonce was in her element on the Experince DVD, if you do not have Beyonce Experience you NEED to buy it NOW!!"
3,She is OK,I like Beyonc enot necessairly for her songwriting skills or the fact that she makes everything about her but for her singing.I love her range (the way she can go so high ang low and do all those runs.Sometimes she does overkill it by screaming all over the stage and all..But this DVD is good.She has some nice singing and performances on this DVD.If you are a fan you should buy this if not keep on MOVING!!!!OVERALL GRADE = 79/100 C+
3,More like 3.5,"This dvd is quite good, although I was expecting more from Beyonce as a performer. Maybe I put my expectations too high. Usually when I buy a live dvd, I am expecting something that will keep me entertain from beginning to end (like Madonna's concerts). At times, I had to press the ""skip"" button because Beyonce was boring me. Another disappointment (this didn't surprise me)is Beyonce over-singing her songs. I find this quite annoying because she doesn't have the range or the style to pull this off. It comes off to showy and it makes her sound like she is struggling. With the exception of her live performance, I think the addition of the bonus cd and the backstage footage made this dvd worth the price. Beyonce is still young, so I will give her time to grow as an artist. After all, not everyone can expect to be a Madonna or Janet so soon in his or her career."
1,ugh,only 13-year olds would buy this.If you want a truly excellent concert dvd experience I suggest Janet Jacksons All For You Tour Live from Hawaii.Beyonce does not compare at all to Ms. Jackson if you're nasty!
4,beyonce is a HIP HOP STAR!!!!!!!!!,"I DONT CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK THIS GIRL CAN DANCE SHE PUTS ALOT INTO HER PERFORMANCES AN PEOPLE WHO SAY DIFFERENT LET ME SEE YOU DO BETTER. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DVD IF YOU ARE A HUGE BEYONCE FAN BECAUSE THERES QUITE A BIT OF BOOTY SHAKIN FOR YOU FELLAS AN FOR THE FEMALES WHO WANNA LEARN LOL, FOR HER GREAT PERFORMANCE IN NAUGHTY GIRL AN BABY BOY AN ALSO CRAZY IN LOVE I GIVE HER 4 STARS ALL THE OTHER SONGS BESIDE SPEECHLESS, AN DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE YOU COULD PROBABLY BYPASS"
4,Great strategy game!,"Great old school, straight forward, strategy game. I still play this on my windows seven PC, but I have lost the ability to link computers for ead to head action. I I sh they had this game for android systems!"
3,In the Face if Jinn,"I was really looking forward to reading this book as I had seen CHC on TV discussing it. After the first few pages I knew this was going to be a hard book to stay with. Mrs. Crew jumps from one subject to another so often that I numerous times had to look back a few pages, thinking I must have lost my place and turned too many pages. The subject matter was very interesting but I feel too broad for the short amount of detail and info given. It made me think of a short version of a shorter short story. I do see the possibility that her husband, Ron Howard, could make this into a very good movie with more info into the story backgound and smoother transition from place to place,etc. I did finally finish the book;but, I will give Mrs.Crew a chance to practice and polish her writing a little more."
2,"Ambitious story, writing skills need work","In the Face of Jinn is a good first effort, but I doubt it would have been published if it wasn't associated with Big Ron. The storyline draws you in, despite skipping around all over the place, but the writing style is klunky and repetitive. The main character Christine alternates between having annoyingly low self esteem and having an unusual penchant for automatic weapons; she mostly likely would have responded well to a mood stabilizer. If Howard Crew keeps practicing, though, she may have a promising career as a novelist."
3,So-so,"Not one of the best books I've ever read, but far from the worse. I found it hard to 'get in to', but soon found myself engrossed. If you can be patient enough to get through the first third of the book, it gets better."
2,So So,"As a first attempt or debut book I will give it a so so rating. The story seems meant more for Bollywood. Great fantasy nothing to do with reality whatsoever(i.e. not well researched or edited). To start with names of characters are half realistic, bad usage and bad usage of indian language (some times it doesn make any sense even they came of local characters, the behavior of the main character changes from chapter to chapter without any smooth transition, not sure how a rape victim can feel any sense of sexual attraction so soon, the writer as a female should have given it little bit more thought. Summing the flow of story is not smooth.I bet if RH was not associated in someway or otherm, the book would have never made the cut."
3,Historically boring,"For such an interesting subject, Mr. David Jennings makes it seem sooooo boring. Researching the sex industry, the book is helpful in establishing a historical time line. I found myself reading though the text thinking, ""There are other things I could be doing."" I was not drawn in at all.I will rate it moderately because I received this book along with another book on the same subject that I found almost addictive. Where I could put down Mr. Jennings book, I could not put down the other. Although I finished reading both books yesterday, I have not thought about Skinflicks on an intellectual level."
2,"Not a bad book, but a bit long winded","Sure, this is an interesting and entertaining story. I couldn't tell where fact ended and fiction began. I was disappointed, being someone who has been both in front of and behind the camera in the adult film world, because it read more like a Hollywood-style script proposal. Again, I did like the book, but it was a big let down because it read like every other book written about this industry as it played to all the ""hot buttons"" and stereotypes. I was surprised by a little-know book titled Cut Throat Business because it depicts the real inner workings of this industry. So if you by this book, I also recommend that you by the other too, you won't be disappointed and you'll get a broader picture of this intriguing industry."
5,Superstar,My son has always liked this style and brand of shoe. We would definitely purchase it again.
1,Worst shoe ever!!!,"I bought this shoe thinking that it would be a comfortable as other Adidas shoes I have purchased in the past. I was wrong, so very wrong. This shoe made my feet hurt for a few days after wearing it around the house to get a feel for them. I would not recommend this shoe to my worst enemy."
4,Great Deal,Husband loved them. Didn't have any problems with the product or shipping. I would have bought 2 pairs if I would have had the money.
1,BEWARE bad product,"I got this printer as a replacement for my broken scanner and HP printer (that worked fine and still does). I had it for 5-6 months and all of a sudden it stopped feeding paper. Well, if it can't feed it won't do anything. If you tried to turn it on it would say there was a paper jam and then it would tell you to turn the machine off, I couldn't even use it as a scanner. So after a few months of back and forth with the company I got sent a replacement. After 2 print jobs, the replacement broke. The encoder strip which controls the ink cartrdges fell off, which is not fixable. The only good thing about the company is even though I was a few weeks past my warranty date they sent me yet another replacement for my replacement. I have only had it 2 weeks, and I am hoping it lasts. I will never stray from HP again."
1,Broken!,"This printer seemed too good to be true for the price, and it was!Less than a year after purchase, and several overpriced ink cartridges, the thing decides to stop loading paper properly - only one side loads, so it's a constant jam - therefore the printer and copier functions are dead. Now I'm left with an oversized scanner."
4,Great book for Maverick's fans.,"This is a great book to find out the origin of the Dallas Maverick's. It ends in 2003, so there is some information on Dirk and Steve Nash. If someone was really interested in Dirk and Steve I suggest another book, however I did enjoy this one."
2,inappropriate for some audiences,"my son is in love with these characters, but since watching these sing alongs, he has now become very interested in the bully characters and their choice of words. while most songs are perfectly fine, there are two that he (3 at the time, now 4) does not need to be singing. one is about ""when you're big"" you can push others around and step on little people's toes etc. it is sung in a mean voice and is about bullying others. the other is ""i need you like a hole in the head"" a song that is a verbal spat between two characters who are saying mean things back and forth. my son just does not need to learn such mean words at this age, nor does he need to become enamored with a mean dino character. i'm sure others may not take to it the same way, but if i would have known about these 2 songs, i would not have gotten them. it is ""missing"" when he asks to watch it."
4,"WONDERful, but incomplete","This collection consists of 12 of Wonder's best '70's tracks, plus four tracks that were new at the time of this collection's release. What's amazing is that the new tracks are on a par with the best-of material. The timelessness of this music--it mostly sounds as fresh today as it did when it was recorded 20-25 years ago--makes a strong argument for Wonder as THE artist of the '70's. What keeps this collection from a full five stars is the exclusion of any material from his '60's and early '70's Motown albums. And what makes listening to this album a bit sad is the realization that he would never really hit these artistic heights again.dap"
5,A must have for ANY CD collection,"This CD set is 'music' at its best. Original lyrics and talented musicians are lost arts in today's sample, remake, digital instrument society. I listen to these songs often, yet they continue to get better with time. I would name a few of my favorites, but I must honestly say that I like them all! I will always recognize and appreciate Stevie Wonder as the musical genius he is."
4,I know for sure because they have said so...,"This is from an interview with the band:The Agony Scene - is there any deeper meaning in your name? What are your lyrics about - your first full length was released on solid state records - a Christian label. Do you consider yourself as Christians?We are not a Christian band, we've been asked a lot because of our relationship with our label here, but we're just a band trying to make a name for oursleves just like any other band. The lyrics are mostly dark imagery and metaphor about a relationship that our singer had that had gone bad. There are also several songs just about some of his personal experiences."
3,Okay,"The song ""We Bury Our Dead At Dawn"" starts out the album great, but after that the songs really start to sound alot alike. The vocalist is very good. He can scream high and growl low, and both sound great. His high and low voice really contrast eachother great. The musicianship is average. Its not great, but it would be easy to overlook if the album had more variety, but it doesnt. Most of the songs have similiar sounding riffs and the same vocal patterns. This CD gets three stars. One for ""We Bury Our Dead At Dawn"" one for ""Paint It Black"", a Rolling Stones cover that is suprisingly very good, and one star for the fact that even though the songs sound similair, they do hold high quality."
1,White Tapers,These tapers are nothing more than tapers that you can get at any dollar store.You can the go get some pretty green ribbon and glue it around them and there you have it!!!So do not spend the amount of money that is being asked for these tapers they are not worth it!I sent mine back!!!!!!
2,Not what I had expected,I am an American-Sicilian who loves and appreciates our roots' history and traditions including OUR music.This CD is far below what I have been used to. The rendition of popular and well known songs by this singer lack clarity and in some cases it is difficult to believe he is singing the same song you are used to hearing from such singers as Rosa Ballestreri and Toni Pagliaro (e.g. me votu e mi rivotu; ciuri ciuri; Li Beddi Pira).I have discarded this CD
3,Irrelevant and misleading,"Goldberg attempts a slight of hand; he attempts to save religion from the contempt and scorn it deserves by trying to save a place for it apart from science. He urges religious people not to be seduced by wanting to show that their beliefs are scientifically supportable. But the problem is that religion has a place only as long as science has not come up with an explanation of a particular phenomenon. It is true that science will never answer all questions, since it only asks questions which have an answer -- at least ultimately and theoretically. But the questions which have no answer, questions about meaning and purpose, which we all care about will not be answer by science. BUT, BUT, BUT -- neither will they be answered by the fairy tales from the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud, or the Hindu Scriptures."
3,Be sure which generation Nano you have 1st!,"Please be sure that you know which generation of Nano you have before ordering this product. I believe this model is only for the 1st generation Nano. The cover on it is clear, while the cover for the IJet that works with generation 2 Nano has a blue tint. The clear cover will not close if you try to use a generation 2 Nano with it. I found out the hard way!"
2,"Cheap, but crap quality","AquaClear is a great brand. The foam I got did seem a little cheaper quality than the foam that came with the filter. Since it came in a 3 pack, I used only one since they last forever and decided to cut up the others to fit my smaller filters.Out of this 3 pack and after cutting some up I ended up getting:1 for my 702 for my 502 for my 30and a home made slip for the tube so the fry don't get sucked up into the filter.UPDATED 10/4/2012I have 3 Aquaclear 70 filters and I have gone through about 3 boxes not even in one year. The replacements continue to fall apart just after 2 months. The last time I bought was the worst quality yet. I'll be looking into something else for now.*The original foam that came with the filter is still excellent and still using it, it's just the replacements that are crap*"
5,worked.,Bought this for my AquaClear 50. It worked as advertised. Will buy more soon as I run out. I like that they are cleanable and reusable.
2,"Not entirely necessary, yet possibly useful.","It does its job. However, my Aquaclear 70 filter came with a set of filter media, including this sponge. And since you can use something else, such as poly-fil straight from a craft isle, which is much cheaper (and quite possibly better), and/or you can simply gently rinse the foam in tank water during a water change to clear off solid gunk (in fact you want to; rinsing thoroughly gets rid of beneficial bacteria necessary for a healthy tank, and rinsing in tap water will kill the bacteria outright - trace chlorine is still deadly)On the other hand, I did find it useful to cut off a chunk, make a slit, and cover my filter intake to keep any more of my little guys from getting sucked up :( ...and it's always probably a good idea to have spares, just in case. So, especially with shipping, i feel like i spent way more than i should have, but the product itself does what it's supposed to do, and then some. Then again, so does a coat hanger."
5,Ode to a foam filter,It does what it what it is supposed to do. Not much more I can say about a hunk of foam.
5,Best Stuff,This is great. Works well and you can wash them out and use again. saves money. I just love this filtering system.
1,Worst PSP game ever !,"To say it sucks is to give it far more credit than it deserves. Images too dark, no fun at all, stupid chases with horrible camera movement and death around every corner (with long load times). Terrible to collect lots of points, clues, etc. and then lose it all with one wrong turn.If you want a fun game, run as fast as you can AWAY from this lousy game.Lego Star Wars on PSP is fantastic. Try out the Death Jr. games."
4,Excellent Performance By The San Francisco Ballet!!!!!!,"This is one of the best performances from the San Francisco Ballet. I think the San Francisco Ballet and the Artistic Director Helgi Tomasson created this new full length ballet to show that this ballet company is one of the best in the US. I was surprised that this DVD has good dolby digital 5.1 surround sound and picture quality. I would say Othello is a good ballet but the music sounds boring and the performance is kind of boring and that's why I would give this a 4 star DVD. Yuan Yuan Tan is a very good Chinese ballet principal dancer for the San Francisco Ballet. Gonzalo Garcia another principal dancer, performed very well as Cassio. And Lorena Feijoo, another principal dancer performed well as Bianca."
3,"Great dancing, mediocre choreography & score.","We saw Othello from the first row center in the San Francisco Opera House when it was first performed. As always, the dancers from the SFB were outstanding, but the Lubovitch choreography was over-the-top, boring, and lacked continuity. The score was turgid. We've read Othello over the years in a group and seen many productions of the Shakespeare play... in our opinion, Lubovitch fails in his interpretation of the work. It's unfortunate that this is one of the few SFB performances to make it to DVD... The Company is remarkable, and they dance other classic and modern ballets that are much more exciting. The Great Performances DVD is well done, but it's too bad they didn't select something else. If you like Lubovitch, you'll probably like this. Just not our cup of tea!"
4,Double Pack,This double pack is really fun except it is hardly ever in stock!!!!!!! i had to wait a month because everyday when i went to look for it wasn't there! but it was definently worth the wait!! at such a good price this is definently the best game of the century!!!!
1,Doesn't work for me!,"I would love to play the games, and after all that I've heard they sound really fun, but I tried both, and neither of them work. Thye won't even start. There's only one pro to this the Dreamcatcher sent me a small paper back Nancy Drew book. So yeah it might work on some computers but not mine, I'm really sad, cause they sounded so fun, plus it cost me."
3,hard to navigate,I was excited at first to receive the CD but became dissatisfied when I saw how hard it was to navigate through the game.
4,Comfortable Pump,"I was looking for a pump to wear with both skirts and slacks. I can't wear high heels, so it has been difficult to find something pretty as well as comfortable. This shoe is great. It has a low vamp to give it a feminine look, but occasionally the shoe rubs the top of my foot in the wrong place. This is only on one foot, and certainly because of my foot, not the shoe."
5,Awesome shoe!,"I desperately needed a flat pair of shoes to wear with work clothes, and this one was not only cute, but comfortable, too. However, I originally ordered a pair in my normal size (7.5), which was too big, so I exchanged it for a 7, and it fit perfectly. I can walk around all day in these without my feet hurting. You can't beat the price, either. I highly recommend these fabulous shoes!"
3,"A ""must-see"" view of Glass's life for fans. But not quite satisfying.","Not quite satisfying because it may reveal too much. Glass's music takes me to another place, and demystifying the man does not help me better appreciate his art. Still, I'm glad I saw it and the extra features on disc two are great for multiple viewings.Oh, and would someone please get Mr. Glass a proper pizza cutter for his cottage in Nova Scotia. Cutting pizza with a knife?"
2,Portrait of a trophy spouse,"I looked forward to watching this movie because I love Philip Glass's music and I was hoping for something along the lines of32 Short Films About Glenn Gould. I was disappointed to find that this was just a soap opera posing as a documentary, dominated by details about Glass's deteriorating relationship with his trophy wife -- although it is more likely that he was the glamorous trophy spouse for a shallow and conventional woman who obviously did not understand him. Or perhaps it was just the filmmakers' own bias that made the wife so unsympathetic. In any case, I actually lost a lot of respect for Glass as a result of this film. Not recommended."
3,A fine look at our most vibrant contemporary composer,"I'm a huge Philip Glass fan but I think that would make me harder on this film than the average music fan. I know so much about his work, it's harder to surprise me. But this two hour documentary by Scott Hicks does a great job of capturing the remarkably diverse work that Glass is creating, from solo concerts to operas to film scores to symphonies. And the bonus DVD contains three hours of extras including some complete performances, chats with composers he's mentoring like Nico Muhly and much more. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,"Family Violence Book, non starter","Bought this book for graduate program class. It is filled with lots of words that signify very little. Written from the view of political correctness, it provided little that was useful, at least to me."
3,ok anyway,my daughter did not recieve the item she ordered but she was very happy with the item that was sent to her.
3,Not a bad book,"I read through this book very quickly, because I know most of the stuffs. There are couple good examples in this book, which will work. Few samples on the CD do not work.If you don't have a clue what programming is, DO NOT buy this book."
5,Good Paper,Our office loves this paper. Good price and good quality. You can print on it without bleedthrough to the other side.
3,Fine for everyday printing,"The paper is okay - not the best quality but adequate for everyday printing. Also, the price is reasonable."
2,Expected Higher Quality; Got better quality & price at K-Mart,Shipment arrived with damage to box corner which damaged the same corner on the paper. I really expected a smoother and thicker paper. Paper would be OK for quick prints but nothing I would use for professionalism or any paper I needed to turn in at school. Got the K-mart paper cheaper and much better quality. You can print pictures on this paper as opposed to the HP paper. Bought because HP product and my printer is HP and I would not use it for a good print out or pictures.
4,Printer Paper,"A little expensive, but it is good paper. This paper should meet all of your printing needs in one paper."
4,Works well with inkjets..,Reasonably prized paper with no issues during my usage while using an inkjet. The colors seems to be great and I have had no issues....
5,All Purpose Paper - Above the Frey,"This paper is a bit stronger and a bit brighter than the standard 20 lb. bond paper. The brightness factor helps the printed word stand out more, especially noticeable with older laser printers that uses black ink that seems more like dark grey. Also, the heavier weight means the paper is more substantial and it takes more klutzyness to accidentally rip it. My work always stands out on this paper - just compare it to what your office uses! This paper works well with my laser and my laser jet printer. Having sold copiers in my deep past, I can tell it would work well in copiers, too. I wish it were made in a recycled version."
3,Didn't work out on my Blue Doberman,"As a owner of a blue doberman ( color dilution of the black Dobe), I tried this to help her ""bumps"" since it had tea tree in it. It was recommended to me by another blue Dobe owner. Sorry, didn't work out. The smell wasn't that bad, I will keep trying other products, Never ending process, but I love her so."
5,Beverly Sills in her glorious prime with high notes galore!,"This is from an exciting live performance at Carnegie Hall in 1970. It is a non-commerical recording (circulated privately for many years) but the sound is outstanding. Beverly Sills is captured in her absolute prime! It is a delighful comic opera and Sills is hilarious as the Tom-boy diva, Marie (especially in the famous singing lesson scene). As was Sills' special gift, she also brings a touching warmth to the heroine's dilemma. And it is a coloratura showpiece... Sills adds glorious high notes and ornaments throughout. One of her greatest performances! The supporting cast is also excellent. Don't pass up this magical evening!"
3,Ouch!,"We ordered one of these for the office. While it does an excellent job of quickly heating water, many people have complained that the ""cool touch"" surface is nothing of the sort. Because of the design of the handle, your hand is likely to come in contact with the body of the kettle, which in my experience is anything but cool after heating water. We generally make a full kettle, so perhaps it's less of an issue if you are only heating a cup or two."
1,faulty switch,I had this kettle a year ago and six moths after I bought it the on/off switch stopped working. I liked the design so I replaced it with another just like it. I thought that this was just a case of bad luck. Today the swick on the new kettle did the same thing. I will try a different model next time. I sugest you so the same!
1,Poor quality control,The top warped and is not replaceable as a part from Krups.Krups customer service advised us to buy a new kettle.
2,Rather disappointed... Krups is supposed to be a good name.,"Very shortly after purchasing this pot the spout opening, which has a sliding lid, kept getting stuck, and then just finally stopped working all together. So I just pushed it back inside the lid and there it sticks to this very day. It is VERY difficult to get the lid off and on, sometimes I have to pry it off. Most of the time though, I just pour the water into the stuck-open spout. (I would suggest you use purified water that contains NO minerals, that way you NEVER have to clean the pot of mineral build-up!) The cord IS very short, it's rusting inside, and it gets very hot on the outside of the pot!! Would I buy another one? No! Next time I'm going to buy a Thermo Pot because it holds more water and keeps it hot through out the day."
2,Jarring details prevent suspension of disbelief,"Bangkok is a city ripe for this sort of fictional treatment, but John Burdett apparently did not immerse himself deeply enough in Thai culture and Buddhism to pull it off for this Thai reader. There are details that would probably be appreciated by the Western reader as adding a touch of oriental mystery to the proceedings, but because the author gets them wrong, only telegraph his superficial familiarity with Thai culture. A writer who makes much more effective use of Bangkok and Thai culture as a fictional backdrop is S.P. Somtow, a horror/fantasy author who happens to be Thai. I had looked forward to Bangkok 8, but my being Thai seems to have prevented me from enjoying the book as much as most other reviewers."
2,great idea,"I thought the idea of this book was better than the actual read. I loved the idea of a ""thriller"" acted out in an exotic setting; but I found that the story was just pretty good and by the time the ""mystery"" had been solved I was ready to be finished with the thing.One more point: there was a strange tone of condescension throughout the book which was obviously supposed to be part of the narrator's character but it was a little bit too obvious that the author's personal gripes were showing through. It left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Fail...,"You want to read a book from the perspective of Thai? Well, Sonchai Jitpleecheep isn't Thai but Buddhist Englishman. Overall product = FAIL. This book is not only insult to the Thais, as someone here stated already, but to farangs (""white people"") as well. And sadly, Bangkok 8 reinforces some of the worst East vs. West cliches. I wouldn't even call it a 'novel'. It's a travelogue with some plot. The big question is, why Burdett decided to turn from respected lawyer to pitiful writer. Money, perhaps?Possible alternatives:The Big Mangoby Jake Needham,The Coroner's Lunchby Collin Cotterill orA Nail Through the Heart: A Novel of Bangkokby Timothy Hallinan. And if you want Buddhism, go forBuddhism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))."
3,A tough read,"Plot line was very weak, simple you killed my partner, I will kill you, storyline. View points form a Thai perspective, versus the Farangues (non-Thai), was somewhat interesting, but very predicatable ending. So many other graet writers and novels out there, I would not spend money on this title (it was given to me)."
5,Stunningly wonderful,"If you want to be transported away, if you want a book that keeps you on the edge, if you want something new and different and fun to read, get this book. This book rates in the top ten mystery/thriller books I have read in the last 20 years. It is exotic, it is exciting, it takes you places you didn't know existed. This is the first of the series, and I can hardly wait to get the other two. Right on, John Burdett, you are a talent to rank with the best of them, Crais, Connerly, Hall, et al."
3,Disappointing,"The plot is both implausible and simplistic, the suspense virtually non-existent, and the characters not compelling and in some cases little more than caricatures. The interweaving of Buddhist teachings and Thai culture was, for me, somewhat redemptive of the literary shortcomings."
2,Sonchai saves the book.,"I read this book on the recommendation of a Russian writer Victor Pelevin, himself a Buddhist. Now, after finishing the book, I realize that if not for Sonchai, monk turned cop, this book will fall apart under the weight of bizarre tiresome convoluted plot, many unrealized characters, cliches, cultural truisms and propaganda like anti americanism. Sonchai, the Buddhist cop, endlessly self doubting romantic, vulnerable, and smart, saves this mediocre book."
2,"Comic? I don't think, so.","One of the promotional blurbs for Bangkok 8 referred to the book's comic relief. Any humor in this novel escaped me. I found the description of the corruption and sex market in Thailand as very sad. And, these descriptions went on and on and on . . . The plot seemed weak, to me, and the story just tailed off. I was not engaged in the tale and felt nothing for the characters. The appeal of this novel was a mystery to me."
3,Good Book,"I enjoyed Bangkok 8 very much although it dragged at times.This is a very different story. There is a Thai detective who often speculates what other persons were in former lives and who has a mother who was in and later returns to the sex industry,the Bangkok sex industry, the Thai culture, and a supernatural ending. The story is funny at times. I rate this a B+ to an A-."
5,Wonderful Read For Lovers of Thailand,"I picked up this book in Hong Kong en route to Bangkok a few years ago and read and LOVED it. The different writing, true to life details, and wonderful characters interwoven with the idiosyncratic Buddhist beliefs and practices of the the main characters is enchanting, just like Bangkok the city. I have recently read Bangkok Tatoo and love it equally."
4,"Ah, Bangkok....","If you've ever been to Bangkok you'll appreciate all the local color and culture that Burdett weaves into his stories, which I find as enjoyable as the underlying plots. Written from a Farang's perception of a Thai's perception of a Farang, his series shed light on how Thais specifically, and Southeast Asians more generally, view Westerners. Especially good reading if you've been to or plan to visit Bangkok (although some of the more obvious manifestations of the sex trade have more recently been pushed behind doors by a more conservative government). A good, quick read that will prompt you to reach for the next book in the series. Suggestion for Burdett: trying some novels based in Ho Chi Mihn City."
2,Be Prepared,"The background is a bit spicy and exotic, but be prepared for l-o-n-g chapters of people just talking and telling stories. Be prepared for key pieces of information to just fall into the the main character's lap, without a whole lot of effort. Be prepared for thin female characters. The Buddhist insights were interesting but the plot wears itself out."
3,Between Okay and Good,"To me, Bangkok 8 started with a bang, but as I progressed I found myself skimming paragraphs, not a good sign. It was a bit difficult at first to follow until I sort of got into the author's objective. The references to Thailand and it's people and religion were very interesting, but I thought the plot delved too much into erotica, which some people may like, but bores me. I anxiously awaited the paperback version based on reviews, so maybe I expected too much."
2,First 30 pages were interesting....,"If you have ever been to Thailand, served in the Marine Corps or talked to an FBI agent you will not like this book. His facts are a joke! The book is semi-exciting for 30 pages and then just gets boring and repetitive, the characters are lame and plot bland. It's one of those books that the last 25 pages are a chore to get through and you just to finish and be done with it, the ending is easily figured out when you are 70% into the story. Don't waste your money!!"
3,"Taut, intense (90%) then stupid (10%).","The majority of the book was a serious, taut, thriller. At a certain point, a weak feeling snuck up in the text and it went downhill from there to the ending, which was fluffy and disapointing. Not that it would stop me from re-reading the beginning, but I was disappointed."
3,Not what I expected,"Though I looked forward to an exotic thriller in Bangkok, this was not what I expected. The story began taking too far a turn for the bizarre until it had no way of heading back to reality. The ending was just too surreal and unrealistic and left me disappointed. It is well written but strays too far from reality."
4,enjoyable,"As someone who has been to Bangkok, I was glad to come across this book. The premise upon which it was built was quite interesting -- a murder in the red light district that the protagonist is trying to solve. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, though the end got a touch far-fetched."
3,"Great start, head-scratching finish.","...I did not hate this book. The first few chapters - which are short and manageable throughout the book - had me hooked. Burdett establishes Sonchai as an understandable protagonist, even for those unfamiliar with Bangkok and Thai culture. Over the first half of the book, Burdett builds an excellent storyline - albeit a bit too close to Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park (quite possibly the best of this genre) - in one of the most stylistic narrative styles I have encountered. Unfortunately, the book becomes rather convoluted. Burdett establishes too many subplots, and seems intent on mashing them all together. The end product is a conclusion that makes about as much sense as a David Lynch film or Doors lyrics."
3,Too Many Ingrediants in Over Cooked Potboiler,"Intrigued by the premise of a Buddhist detective solving a murder in the lurid red light district of decadent Bangkok, my interest was initially rewarded. Burkett paints a fascinating portrait of an international city filled with culture and contradiction. His depiction of crime, corruption and society in Thailand are worth the read. The background is great, but as a action/mystery the plot and story fail to keep pace. The author overreached and tried for spiritual depth, social commentary, cultural analysis and lost sight of suspense, tension and credibility essential to a mystery novel. The ending was like some tacked on silly Hollywood resolution."
3,"Wild Ride, Weak Ending","Bangkok 8 is indeed a well written, fast paced, page-turner of a mystery. The characters are fascinating, none less so than our protagonist, Sonchai Jitpleecheep.The novel starts with the murder of a US Marine in the most bizarre of manners - drug crazed poisonous snakes. Unfortunately, Sonchai and his partner were ordered to follow this Marine and were at the scene of his death where Sonchai's partner is bitten and killed by a snake. Sonchai is determined to seek out the killer and revenge.As a mystery Burdett has done a good job of unfolding the layers of the Sonchai's search for the truth behind events and the characters are truly fascinating. So too is the locale and culture that is the backdrop of the novel. Thailand's sex trade, drug dealing, psychotic powerful Westerners, and Buddhism are blended into the tapestry.The end, however, is very weak and disappointing and really a downer after an otherwise very enjoyable story."
4,Wow! What a great read!,"This is a book I did not want to finish because I liked it so much. I simply didn't want it to end. Bangkok 8 was such a pleasant surprise to me that I am recommending it to everyone I know. Loved the characters and loved the plot, a little wayward at times but I was really pleased with this book. Maybe Burdett will continue with Sonchai's character in another book! Highly recommended!"
4,Mesmerizing,"If you've been to Bangkok, this novel is a must-read. Burdett has delved deeply into Thai culture, the Buddhist mindset, and the contradictions experienced by a third world city that has grown exponentially with little planning and a great deal of Western influence over the past twenty years. Some of the dialogue is stilted. However, the protagonist Sonchai's frequent meditations on his life, Bangkok, and the crime he is trying to solve make for fascinating reading. This is an unique and engaging thriller. I'm amazed at the amount and depth of the research that Burdett did and what he was able to do with it. Bangkok 8 makes me want to go back to Thailand."
2,Meh.,"The writing in this book was typical run-of-the-mill mystery/thriller writing, but it expected the so-called ""exotic locale"" to lift it above the genre. It didn't. I'll admit that I've never been to Thailand, but the whole book was an unsuccessful attempt of a westerner trying to sound like a Thai person. I was insulted and I'm not even Thai. It seemed to me that the author just didn't have enough knowledge/experience to be able to create a Thai protagonist. The result was your average sarcastic white cop protagonist in a Thai costume. Great for people who want a book about a foreign country without having to think too much about it.And, for all of you grammar nerds out there, this book was RIFE with comma splices. No, they weren't used with creative license. Who edited this book, anyway?"
3,Pretty Good Book,"This book gives the old detective genre a spicy twist. You can't help getting caught up in the main character's troubles and feeling sorry for him at the same time. I'll admit I got bored a couple of times, when the paragraphs rambled a bit, but all in all, it is a pretty good book."
4,Bangkok Unravelled,"At first, I thought Burdett was patronizing the reader. I thought the short chapters and the sprinkling of Buddhist refrences were an attempt to attract the attention of unsophisticated readers totally unfamiliar with the East. As the book went on, it spiralled deeper and deeper, like unwrapping an onion. The ending was quite a surprise and I read the last fourth of the book in one setting. He took us into a new world of mysticism and sexuality.Still, I was left feeling that something was missing, that he only put half of his cultural cards on the table. I am eagerly waiting for a deeper trip into in this same genre from Burdett. We can take it, John."
5,"Great Mystery, Great Travelogue",An in depth introduction to the life and culture of Thailand in a novel of mystery and intrigue.Well done. A great book!
4,Fun and Philosophy.,"This is one continuous culture-shock of a book, but in a fun way. The point-of-view of a Thai Buddhist policeman, son of a prostitute and an American military man is fantastic. A world where the crime bosses and the police captains are the same people. I intend to read at least one more book from this series."
1,Not as good as anticipated,"I do not normally buy hardbacks, and would recommend anyone thinking about purchasing this book, wait for the paperback version. Or better yet, get it from the library. The book had a very weak ending, and was well too.......you'll understand if and when you read it. A real dissappointment."
2,Alluring plot in great locale..anti usa bias too heavy!,I enjoyed this book for about 200 pages then soured on it's endless anti usa theme. To blame all the worlds ills on the usa is just to simple and ignores the worlds complexities. This guy blasts the usa but will take our money for this book? What a joker. I buy a book for entertainment not moral lambasting..If I want that I go to church (which I never do).
2,Naval Architecture has never been more interesting,"Well, maybe it has. Anyway, this book is really poorly written and frequently pisses you off. Plus, the index has only the words that you never need to look up. If you're buying this book you've probably been required to do it by some higher power, but don't buy it otherwise. Just use PNA if you can get away with it."
1,What A Disappointment !!,"I bought this little oven with VERY high expectations. It looks like such quality from the outside. I rarely use it, but when I do, even the frozen pizzas come out undercooked. The rack falls down inside, the bottom control knob feels as though it isn't even connected and it may not be for all I know. I guess I had better get it looked at, nothing can be this bad intentionally. Ugh!"
1,If looks can kill (my wallet) - this evil oven laughs at me every morning,"Handsomely retro, solidly metal, and with a sexy name like Dualit, how could it possibly disappoint?As the wise man warned, ""Do not judge a book by its cover"" - I foolishly decided to ignore such common sense and dive into a $300 mistake I am now stuck with spending 20 minutes making none other than - a routine piece of toast.Maybe if I traveled through time and lived in a cave with one working electric outlet, I might thank God for blessing me with such a miraculous invention given my only other option was a fire pit. Sadly, in present day - with so many better toaster ovens parading throughout the electronic isle, it only makes me wonder, ""Why - dammit...WHY???""This toaster oven SUCKS.Unless you have major patience and a lot of extra time, keep on looking.Never mind how good it looks.After all, even the loveliest supermodel can become painfully annoying if all they give you is grief."
3,Decent Starter Set for the Hip Hop Novice--,"If someone is interested in a convenient 2-disc ""mixtape"" to keep a party going, they can't go wrong with this collection. It is essentially a condensed version of the four-disc ""HIP HOP BOX"" that Hip-O/Universal released some time ago, which was a chronicling of key hip-hop hits from the humble beginnings of Rapper's Delight (1979) to the vast mainstream success of the early 2000's. Of particular interest are those which fall within Universal's vast back catalog, including such merged and/or defunct labels as MCA, Def Jam, Uptown, Island, Polydor, and more.Casual or new hip-hop fans will find this compilation satisfactory-- dedicated listeners who are fans of specific artists are best advised to seek out their greatest hits/best of sets (if available)."
4,HipHop Gold,"This is what I expected. Tracks of old school hip hop music from some of the best during their time, laying down ""the rap"" with a nice music bed from the back. The quality of this CD is very good. I look forward to future purchases from this dealer.Mike Boss."
3,Nice cage but no bird,"An amusing read about the misadventures of a Time Share OPC [ off premises contact ] mainly over in Tenefife, Spain. The main character from England tells about some of the different ways he talks vacationers into taking timeshare tours, and the compensation for each tour taken . It seems that they make good money and spend it fast as well with alot of partying. Partly and probably due to the high stress nature of the job. Not too much, however, on how timeshares work, who buys them, the role of sales, trading, the long term advantages etc."
2,"He could'da been a contender, but he took a dive.","Short-story in large type; well-suited for the intellectually disinclined. It has some cute stuff but it is about what one might expect from a timeshare tout. Poorly written and considering the well-known honesty of those in timeshare sales, one has to suspect that very little of it is based in truth."
3,Mistake book order...,"Very disappointed that they recieved the paperback edition of the book instead of the HARD COVER, which is what I ordered AND what they expected! I hope this mistake is rectified before the holiday.Matt Murphy310-871-5480"
5,Out with a bang!,"I wish Lionel and the boys (Commodores) would do a reunion tour, but until then, I'll just play this cd. This was his first solo project and by far the best."
5,the ex-Commodore's solo debut,"Commodores member Lionel Richie left the R&B band in 1981 to pursue a solo career thus working on this album. His first non-Commodores hit was his personally penned ENDLESS LOVE,a duet with ex-Supreme Diana Ross. That was from the 1981 film of the same title starring Brooke Shields. It would be later covered by Luther Vandross and Mariah Carey. Hits from this album include TRULY and YOU ARE. According to Norm N. Nite's Rock On Almanac,this album was one of the top albums of 1982 although it only spawned two Top 20 hits. Richie's 1983 follow-up CAN'T SLOW DOWN would be an even bigger hit,resulting in winning a multitude of Grammys. As for the Commodores,they would disband in 1985."
4,"Great, but-------","If you're looking for nostalgia, don't buy this album. Go for the ""Ultimate Collection"" by Diana Ross and the Supremes. The latter album has all the songs that this one does plus many more! If I had been more aware of this, I would not have bothered with this one!"
1,Not A Good Compilation,"There are a number of far superior compilations for them, including Anthology and Ultimate Collection. This is simply not worth your time or money."
4,"A collection of good songs, but not perfect.","The Supremes produced some great music in the 60's, and this is a good collection of it, even if it lacks some of their songs. Definitely deserves a solid four stars."
4,The Ride is over :(,"Clover may have its own ups and downs, like a rollercoaster those are what make the trip fun... I for one, am sad that the ride is over.They have some really good music and some of it makes you wish you had never heard them, but holding that aside - I hope they come back."
2,Doesn't Stick Well,"This tape is very gentle. HOWEVER, it does not stay in place during normal light daily duties. It came off within a few hours. 3M Durapore tape stays in place much better."
1,A Horrible Book,"This man, Daniel Lalond Jr is going to hell for denying the grace of God and teaching a works based salvation. Romans 11:6, 4:13-14, and many other verses say he is lost and going to hell. No wonder he disagrees with these godly men of God. He has no truth in him and can't discern the word of God at all. 1 Corinthians 2:12-14, John 8:47, Luke 8:10, Isaiah 8:20. This man is unsaved and on his way to hell and needs to believe the Bible when it says: believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house. I hope no one else reads this horribly blasphemous book!"
4,Wake up before it is too late!,The lying Promise should be read by all Christians! There is too muchsinning going on out there! People need too know the wages of sinIs still death.
1,Simply untrue...,"Every conclusion this author makes is erroneous. Clearly he simply wants to attack some of the most respected Christian speakers and authors of the day. Jealous, much? He misinterprets and twists their words to prove his own points. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
1,one more book that teaches that you are saved with grace plus works.,"one more book that teaches that you are saved with grace plus works. Daniel Lalonde Jr must be an Arminian to teach grace plus works saves you and gets you to heaven. First we are saved by GRACE alone then when we do good works we are rewarded when we get to heaven, works is a reward issue after we get saved not a salvation requirement."
4,Alternative use,"I purchased this item because Dr. Oz stated it was great for the control of cold sores. It has yet to work for that purpose. Nevertheless, I used it for my daughter's chapped lips. I also has a pleasant lemon fragrance."
1,herb salve w/lemon balm! is what the label should read,Herb salve w/lemon balm! is what the label should read on the front. I was misled by the label shown to think it was lemon balm salve. They should display both sides of the label and show you what is really in it. Don't buy this if Lemon balm salve is what your looking for.
5,Really works!!,"I bought this for my granddaughter, and it really works on cold sores! As soon as she feels one starting on her lip, she applies the salve, and it goes away. Great product!"
1,Ranting and ranting,This is one of the few books which made me think that I should ask for my money back. Fontova touches on valid points but his selective history and his unbearably basic prose make this book worth less than the paper it is printed on.
1,Terrible,Leave it up to people like this writer to give right-winged cons a bad name all on thier own. Horrible.
5,THE TRUTH...AT LONG LAST,The absolute truth about the Castro revolution. Years of disinformation are exposed. The reason the Cuban revolution occurred was a desire of the Cuban people to restore constitutional democracy. Fidel Castro never did that and he has jailed and murdered more people than the rest of Latin America combined. Yet these facts are curiously overlooked by the US media and academia. This book is the absolute truth.... buy it and read it. Castro has ruled with an iron hand for 48 years transforming Cuba into his own personal fiefdom. Why has it taken so many years for folks in the US to wake up to the Orwellian nightmare that lies just 90 miles from the United States? read this book!
4,MEET THE REAL FIDEL....,"An outstanding book about the real Fidel, the corrupt thug and tyrant who has economically ruined his country, lied to his people about restoring Cuba's constitution of 1940 (as democratic a document as the US Constitution), and executed and imprisoned more dissidents that the rest of Latin America's dictatorships of the 1960s and 1970s combined.Humberto Fontova shines the spotlight on the longest reigning tyrant in the World today, a tyrant adored and idolized by much of Hollywood and our mainstream media, the same Leftists who once swooned over the now defunct Soviet Union until the Berlin Wall fell and the truth behind the former iron curtain became too obvious for any but the most idiotic fools to notice."
3,Pediped is better,"These were so cute when they arrived and I was excited to use them, however, I found that after my son turned one, they became less useful due to the flimsy nature of the sole. As others have mention in the PediPed reviews, I have problems with the Robeez leaving deep elastic marks on my son, even when thick socks are used. Robeez are great for under one year, but not great for kids on the move. I recommend an equivalent looking PediPed sandal: Pediped Harvey Sandal"
3,"Hole in toe of shoe, within a few days.","I loved Robeez for my baby when she was crawling, but now that she is learning to walk, I am not so sure that this is a good shoe for her. Within a few days after purchase, there was a big hole in the toe of her shoe. These shoes are pricey, which I am fine with as long as the quality matches the price. I may try buying one more pair, but if there is another hole, I will no longer recommend these shoes for a child when they start walking."
3,"Works fine, but blew up after a power outage...","Bought this on sale at Fry's in January, 2011. Awesome deal! Only paid $99. Worked great initially, but recently had a power outage in San Diego. I guess when everything came back on it fried the PSU. What makes it worse is the power somehow passed through the unit while it was off and blew up my video card as well. That's why only 3 stars. Not very effective. Also, I don't get only being partially modular. There are 6 unused plugs that I have to cram in my case and it makes for reduced airflow. So, if you come across one of these for cheap, definitely worth it. Otherwise, there are fully modular units for less money with better efficiency ratings and warranties."
1,What a waste of money,I was looking for insight. None to be found here. The fact that Amazon charges for this at all is almost criminal.
4,"Freaky Fruit & Vengeful Vegetables, Beware The MAGIC PICKLE!","If you're anything like me, you've probably always wanted to see a super-powered pickle in an epic struggle with an evil head of lettuce (The Romaine Gladiator), and his cronies (The Brotherhood of Evil Produce). Well look no further, because your prayers have been answered!Creator Scott Morse is clearly having fun with this stuff, and it shows. From cute little Jo Jo Wigman (The aspiring ""Sweet Tomato"") to the gun-toting Loconut, it's all good. I've never liked pickles, but thanks to Scott Morse, I've discovered a reason to stand up and cheer: ""Long Live the Magic Pickle!!!!!"""
3,worth the money???? not sure,"I'm using this lens with a Pentax K-7. There is nothing wrong with it besides incorrect automatic focusing, so I have to do it manually. That's the only thing I found to be wrong with it."
5,Supercalifragilistic,"Honestly, this is the best lens you can get for the money. Sharp and clear with very smooth bokeh. Hands down it outperforms anything in this price range. Further, it is considered by many, including Photodo, to be superior to the equivalent lenses by Canon and Nikon.In summary, if you have a Pentax, you need to own this lens."
5,The proof is in the photos,I couldn't be happier with my Pentax 50mm lens and the proof is in the photos. It's worth every cent.
5,Just buy it.,"If you've never had a fixed lens you don't even know what you're missing. If you've never had a lens that fast you don't know what you're missing. If you've never had an original Pentax lens on your Pentax or Samsung camera, you don't know what you're missing.Just go and buy it. What are you waiting for?"
2,Did Not Leave My Prepositions Dangling,"A condensed review for a condensed version of the Bible of style.Rule 1: Do Not Let Your Prepositions . . . . . . dangle.This advice will help you avoid difficult moments when you get to college. For example, on your first day at Harvard do not approach a senior and inquire: ""Where is Harvard Yard at""? The senior will no doubt reply: ""At Harvard we do not leave prepositions dangling."" After reading this book you will know that the question, when phrased properly [see paragraph on the splitting of infinitives when parsing this sentence] should read: ""Where is Harvard Yard at smarty pants."""
1,The Element of Syle,"I suggest you look at your program. When you print this item it comes out on machine language, it's not legible. So please if you want to continue to sell please check your software.I'm very upset and unhappy because I thought I was purchasing something that I could use."
5,Get the unrated R&R F,Simple as that - get the unrated R&R Frankenstein DVD and stay away from the butchered MPAA sanctioned R rated cut.
1,actually -100 stars,"Standard Shock-o-rama cinema BOREfest.The term cruel and unusual punishment do not even begin to describe the experience of having to sit through this ""movie"".This movie is sooo unbelievably boring, that about half way through the film i just couldn't take it anymore and went to go wash dishes.. after that i just got back in time for the last 5 mnts. That was enough to make me want to burn the dvd (...). This movie is utterly stupid and not funny at all, although it seems like they makers were really trying desperately to be funny. Seriously, A Rose for Emily was a barrel of laughs compared to this crummy afterbirth excuse for a movie. I cant even believe people actually think this is funny. not funny, just painfully stupid.shock-o-rama makes the worst movies, and r-n-r f proves it..."
5,Very good.,"I found it interesting, I would love to , when it is available find a book about the every day lives of the Greeks and Romans in historical times."
2,Roman world,"The book was an ex library book, the book jacket was in a bad condition. The book has been annotated and written in. The supplier classed the condition of this book as good, and charged 16 for it. How can the condition of a book that has been drawn and written in be described as good. I would not use these guys again."
4,still struggling to understand the VN war,"Any serious student of the war(s) in Indochina must read this book. Ho Chi Minh was a nationalist first, but he was also ideologically a committed Communist. He would today be tried for mass genocide for the murder of hundreds of thousands of his own people that protested his formula for a united Vietnam. On the other hand, the French in Indochina were reprehensible, but they were our ""allies."" That means little to the French but it does mean something to Americans. You stand with your allies, or maybe you change allies. Patti does not point to one promise of American support, vis-a-vis the French, made by the US government to Ho Chi Minh. Our ""sentiment"" may have been for the liberation of the all of Indochina but our obligation was to our allies. It is unfortunate that we did not just walk away from it and let them sort it out. Does that not have a familiar ring today?"
4,Very thorough book,"Very well written and thorough book, but few pictures of the MKIII Cooper S.As I bought it prior to restoration of a MKIII, it was a little dissapointing, but else, thumbs up!"
2,still supremes?,"this is an ok album. it could have used some non-solo songs, i.e. high enery, i wish i were your mirror, sweet dream machine or only you(can love me like you love me). still not as exciting, but more r&b, than the old supremes."
2,Not so Great,"I'm not a fan of Jackie Collins but I did read Chances and thought it was wonderful. I decided to read Thrill! What a waste of time that was. The characters were uninspiring, underdeveloped, and one dimensional. I was so tired of hearing how beautiful the main character was. It's as if she had nothing else going for her. Ms. Collins attempted to make Lara's lover (Joey) seem mysterious and a bit bad-boyish but it didn't work. In fact, I felt like he was bipolar. The story or stories were lack luster. And the most annoying part of all were all the italicized words that were thrown haphazardly on the pages. The book should have been called Annoying! instead."
2,No Chemistry...,"I was offended by the hero's behavior. I found him to be very unlikable....and since the heroine was so gah-gah over him I lost interest in her welfare too. Wonder why people think so much degrading behavior is entertaining or captivating. I didn't cheer for anybody in this book. However, I give it two stars because the setting is so far removed from ""everyday life"" that it may be a good escape for some."
4,not the best,"this book did keep my interest, but i didnt feel the same chemistry between the two main characters as i felt in jackie's other books, i dont think that Joey is a likable character, i kept going back and forth on liking him or not. not her best but i still enjoyed reading it."
5,Typical Jackie Collins - Great Book,"It was a typical Jackie Collins book, a little perdictable but a great book. It was a real page turner, I sat up late one night because I couldn't wait to see how it ends. I can't wait for her next book to come out. I understand it's in September, to long as far as I'm concerned."
4,"Easy reading, entertaining and Exciting","Not one of Jackie Collins best, but a real page turner and easy reading. I liked the way it was two stories in one, that made it very interesting. It could have used more substance, it was a little weak in general, but I would recommend it to my friends."
5,A typical Jackie Collins - great read from start to finish,"Just like Ms. Collins' other books - you cannot put this down. Her characters are entertaining, interesting and a great read.Ms. Collins' writes a great trashy novel. Not too much erotica and just enough plot to make it very interesting, but like her other books it is the characters we love.I started it and could not stop until I finished it. A great beach novel."
1,Horrible...wasted money. Tsk tsk Jackie,"Jackie didn't even try!The so-called 'chemistry' between *anyone* was lacking (Especially main characters Lara and Joey) Joey was a stupid, self centred, rude, pathetic and 'usual' square jawed/romance novel 'hero' who thinks he's so hot, and i hated him.Sorry to break it to you jackie, but there's a new breed in town, and it consists of being sweet, funny and at least a guy with a good nature if he's going to go and do all the stuff he did in the book. Lara was a snivelling wuss, all the men and women were boring and flat and the plot has been done to death in some of your stories. I wasted $12 on this book to which i regret. Read her better stuff, like 'hollywood wives'. give this one a skip"
2,Definitely Not a Thrill,"Let me start by saying that I am an avid fan of Jackie Collins. But it was very hard to get to the end of this book and when I finally got there, it still left me wanting. All I can say is you can't win 'em all and a winner this is definitely not!There was no plot. I thought the prologue was about Joey but at the end it was Richard. Throughout the book I waited for the dark side of Joey to emerge and what happens? He was locked up for a crime he didn't commit. This book is a suspense builder that doesn't deliver. I'll be waiting for the next one."
2,Not Jackie's Best,"I like Jackie's novels for the pure entertainment. This one just doens't live up to her other books. Our heroine Lara was just not that interesting and I didn't really feel good about Joey either. It is okay, but her other books are so much better that I would not bother with this one."
2,Surprisingly tame and rather boring.,"I picked this up at the airport for a quick read, but this book was surprisingly bloodless. The characters never stick to my mind, and the plots are hysterically ludicrous. There's not even great bedroom scenes to compensate for my wasted time. Oh well."
2,Not a thrill,"This book isn't as good as Jackies' other books. It uses her same storylines over and over. By the way, does it seem like she has about 15 different plots that she uses over and over in her books? I really wouldn't buy this book new, buy it used if at all."
4,Once nupon a time,"Back in 1967-68 when this group had it's greatest hits they were up against the Temptations,Smokey Robinson and the Miracles,the Four Tops, (who were their labelmates later at Motown)as well as others like the Dells,The Delfonics, and the Intruders,this set is very good if your memories of them are strong,otherwise you will be quite unfamiliar with them except for their biggest hit ""The whole world is a stage,personally I liked this group a lot but I would have to have a very special memory of them to pay over $50.00 for their music as rare as it is..."
4,The Depth Of Motown talent......,"During Motown's mid-60s heyday, radio stations couldn't keep up with the great amount of music pouring out of Motown's doors! Thus, many very good songs weren't heard often by radio listernership. The Fantastic Four were one of a number of groups signed to the label at that time, who were somewhat lost in the Motown shuffle. Nevertheless, their lone lp release on the label is well known (The Whole World Is A Stage & Goddess Of Love) to Motown music listeners of the era. The album is a quality album and merits it's own spot in an old-school soul collection. The lp (in mint- condition), or out-of print cd, will command a high market price tag from the few sellers willing to part with it. For most who possess, parting is not an option. Can only trust it will be re-released for assessability to soul collectors at prices that suit the palate."
4,Great for travel,We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old son. He loved it the minute we took it out of the box. He is an average size toddler and fits very easily into the bed with it zipped all the way up. He loves to zip himself in and snuggle up for the night. It is a breeze to inflate and just as easy to deflate. Fits easily into the bag provided also. Our bag ripped very easily though as it was tossed around but it will be easy enough to find another bag to fit this in. Would recommend for anyone who travels with a toddler.
5,GREAT,"Bought this for my six year old's birthday. He LOVES it. He likes to lay in it to watch movies. Also to take to Grandmas and on vacation. Pretty average inflatable bed, too much air and it's gonna be too hard. Pretty light. I definitely recommend!"
4,Fun for kids,My son enjoys the ease of dragging it from room to room and laying on it or sitting on it however the mood strikes him.
4,Great Little Bed!,"I purchased this bed a couple months ago for my 3 year old son. It finally developed a small pin hole in the mattress. I contacted readybed today and they are sending a replacement free of charge. They said it may take up to 2 months to receive my replacement because they are on backorder. Was a little disappointed about that...but was impressed with the customer service dept. THey returned my call with-in five minutes of leaving a message and were very polite and helpful. I have washed the sleeping bag part, turned inside out (soft side turned inside), a few times now on delicate and air dried it. It has kept it's 'newness' look and shape so far.Would buy from this company again!"
2,Child's Disappointment,My 5 year old grandson got the Spiderman Readybed for Christmas. It is now March and the bed will NOT stay inflated. There seems to be something wrong with the inside of the vavle because there is no hole in the bed itself. My grandson is very disappointed so I bought a chaise pad that fits perfectly into the cover and now he is happy. I'm not because I had to spend the extra money on something that should have lasted longer that 3 months.
3,"2 good, 2 bad","I've ordered 4 of these tires, 2 about a year ago and 2 more about a month ago. The first ones I received were great; there was no problem with them and they held up well over a year of extensive use. When my tires were mysteriously slashed recently, it was a no brainer that I'd pick up 2 more of these. Unfortunately, the ones I received recently both had defects: a portion of each tire bulged a good deal. I know Cheng Shin is able to produce good tires, but apparently their quality control practices are lacking. It's hit or miss with these guys."
1,odd feel on road,"Just bought a set of these from this seller (Niagra) and they shipped fast and the tires are brand new and visually flawless....however, this model (C732) is Cheng Shin's bottom of the line tire and they are, indeed, poorly designed and/or manufactured. They have a highly raised center ridge and inconsistent shape which gives a subtlety strange and annoying ride (""floppy"" is the only way I can describe it).At about 453 grams each (1 pound), they're also relatively heavy. Much of that weight is in the sidewalls, which is unnecessary.I owned Cheng Shin ""Super HP"" tires before this, which have a wide ""slick"" tread in the center and they did not have any problems (plus, they weigh about 30g less, each)...shoulda spent the extra $ and bought another set of those.UPDATE: Bought a set of Vittoria ""Zaffiro"" for only $5 more than the C732 and they work perfectly...plus, they weigh 63g less."
5,Cheapest I could find and still work great,"I was a little skeptical at fist because of the low price, but I have been using them for the past two weeks and haven't noticed any difference between these and more expensive brands. I'm not sure about other reviews saying they are rated for only 90 PSI. Mine were clearly marked at 100 PSI, and they have been working great at that pressure. The original tires on my old Schwinn bikes were 1-1/4"" wide, but the 1-1/8"" tires fit just fine. I would like to have supported my LBS, but they wanted $20 a tire. I got 4 of these tires for about $32.It took me a while to learn that you aren't supposed to use tools to install bike tires. (this cost me a couple of brand new tubes) If you're not experienced with changing bike tires, just look it up on YouTube."
3,Good and bad,"I bought 3 of these. One to use right away and 2 for backup. The one I put on when I received them worked great for about 1000 miles. It ended up with a chunk gouged out of it but I'm not sure if that was due to the tire or a road hazard. I just tried putting the other two on and one was good but the other had a defect in it. It has a spot where it bulges even at 50 lbs of pressure. If I had tested them when I received them, I could've gotten a replacement but I waited too long. Looks like I wasted ten bucks. I'm up in the air on whether or not to purchase again. I might try something different to compare. I've had Bontragers in the past and they've held up well but seem to lose traction faster."
5,Excellent Bike Tire,Bought this tire because it was a fraction of the prices I checked on locally. It is a good quality tire and am getting a lot of use from it. Thank you
5,Believe it,"I grew up playing for the ""publics"" in the town of Tomah. The author was four years ahead of me but my experiences were similar. I recognized almost every character in the book and remembered parts of my childhood that had been long forgotten. I never dreamed that this book would also tell the story of so many others growing up in the 50's. I applaud the author for this excellent book and wonder how he could remember so much of his childhood."
3,Started out pretty strong..,but it lost speed quickly after that. I got about 1/4 of it read then I began skipping around. The result of doing that I decided it wasn't worth reading more of it.
5,Good real life story of all boys in th 50s,"This is a must read for all of us the wished that we were the best jock, but only measured up to normal. It tells just how good we had it and really how funny life is after a few years."
4,Works as advertised,"I purchased this for a 2005 Chevy Equinox without the factory amp and without OnStar. If you are installing an aftermarket stereo you have to have this if you want to retain the chimes that happen when you lock your door, leave the key in the ignition, leave the lights on, etc.It was easy to hook up and clearly labeled. If the chime/ding is too loud for you then you have the option to cut a wire on the circuit board and it is supposed to make it quieter. I just left it alone for now.The chime dings faster than the original so it also doesn't ding as long when locking the doors. So, you lock your door and it dings a few times then stops before you even get the door closed. Not a big deal, just took a little getting used to. It sounds different from the factory ding but you get used to it.It lets the radio stay on after you turn the key off just like the factory radio did on its own."
3,SMASH the anger!,"Peter David, the acclaimed comic book writer that revitalized The Hulk, adapts the maligned movie into a decent novel. The Hulk takes its sweet time showing up, but the characters and their backstories are well drawn enough to make the wait worthwhile. There are some minor changes in character and motivation, especially in regards to Glen Talbot, and, for the most part, it helps the story more than hinders it (though there are a few narrative wrinkles that another rewrite could have ironed out). Not a bad book at all, fans will certainly enjoy it."
2,Simplistic,"A broad view of vacation homes. Chapters on Colorado, Florida, etc. Not really enough ""nuts and bolts."" Would be good if you are in early stages of deciding to get a vacation home. A good websurf would probably provide more info."
2,Pee-U!,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it had some amusing quotes. It is very telling that the authors keep recommending books by Robert Irwin.They should have entitled it ""Where to Consider Buying Your Vacation Home With a Tiny Bit of Other Info Thrown in So That Suckers Glancing at the Table of Contents Will be Fooled into Buying it.""Glad I didn't!"
2,not for jeep liberty,"This product does not fit the 2005 Jeep Liberty. It is not worth returning because in addition to a 20% restocking fee, ""All return shipping costs are the responsibility of the buyer. AutoPartsWAY is not responsible for any description or application errors on the Amazon.com website.""They are nice liners, but not for an 05 Jeep Liberty!"
3,Entertaining-- but no extras!!!,"When I watched the show on MTV there were a ton of extra things apart from the show, like cooking segments after each episode, behind the scenes stuff and the one where they went to spring break (maybe that was something totally different). I thought at least some of that stuff would be on there. But it wasn't-- a little overpriced without any bonus features."
1,Not very pleasing,"I was optimistic at first, but this story is very repetitive and boring! It lacked many key qualities that a story needs! It was very hard to get interested in it and it was very hard to understand!"
1,PLEASE!!!!!!,"The Red Badge Of Courage is TERRIBLE! Stephen Crane COULD NOT WRITE! And one thing I find disturbing is that people see this as a 'classic'. This is NOT A CLASSIC! It depicts the vision of the Civil War through a child fighting, but THERE IS NOTHING EXCITING ABOUT IT!If you want to read about war, then I suggest that you pick up a Tom Clancy novel, and enjoy that than reading this crap!"
2,"Overpriced, poor quality",So far it has held up a 100 lb heavy bag without failure. It hasn't really been exposed too much to the elements yet is beginning to rust already! For the price (including the shipping) I would expect better.
1,"bought it, might break it","Bought this dvd, cause it is Poison, and I thought I'd give it a chance. It's lame. Two boring interviews. I bought it, now I might break it, cause breaking it would be funner than ever watching it again."
5,Cutting Edge,"If you've never been one to be on the cutting edge as far as music goes, Big 10-4 could be the difference. I purchased the album on a whim and a suggestion from a dedicated fan, wondering if it would live up to what I had been told. And live up it did. Beyond my expectations. Buy the album now and you'll be one-up on the music industry. Industry reviews have compared Dan Verduin's lyrics and the band's music to the stylings of Tom Petty, Matchbox 20, Third Eye Blind, etc."
1,very dissatisfied,The zipper on the back pack is broken already. My son is in kindergarten and he carries one small notebook to school in it. I noticed it had a tear in it the other day and now the zipper is just gone. He has only used it about 4 or 5 times.
2,More like a pamphlet than a text for a Master's program,"For $30, this ""text book"" is smaller than the IRS tax instructions and should be available for about 1/3 the cost if it is going to be used in academic instruction. It is not worth the cost nor is the information contained in it worthy of being considered a text for a course in the Masters program. All of the subjects in the book are found in free online articles."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This book was very dry, and not really what I was looking for, so maybe that is why I didn't like it very much. I wanted a book on adult learning, but this didn't have much too it for the price. Read a few pages of the book before you decide to buy."
3,What A Way To Bring Back The Memories!,"The rating is mediocre because of the lesser tracks included on the disc. Although ""I Call Your Name"" & ""There'll Never Be"" more than deserve 5 stars by themselves. Oh, the memories listening brought back to me! But, the best treat of all, was when my 16 year old niece knew ""I Call Your Name"" and we did an impromptu duet in the parking lot of Whole Foods. Music and memories at their best."
5,they was the sh -t,"I finsh high school 1982 and this was the music. we used to skate off switch. boy did I have the girls back then, good old days, it wasn,t no shooting and killing. we was having big fun, I can go on and on."
4,Sexy and passionate!,"This book is wonderful. Full of magic, passion, and sultriness as hot as any Arabian desert. Darius is an oh-so-sexy hero to die for, and Isis is a wonderfully feitsy heroine. This book is truly a gem.Now, anyone knows the phone number of the guy in the cover? :)"
4,A new way to look at almost everything.,"MARRYING STONE didn't just grab me at the beginning. At first I thought it might become boring. Was I wrong! The longer I read, the better it got. This is a wonderful book about a culture that's very different from the usual even in the early 1900s, and it's even more different from ours today. The wisdom and depth of this book sneaked up on me little by little, and I truly loved many of the characters of the inhabitants of Marrying Stone, particularly Jesse. It's a very artfully written book, and I loved it."
1,A cautionary tale,"Given the current woes of the American auto industry, I find it surprising that people take this book seriously. It is merely a puff piece for the ""We're number one"" Americans who prefer self-satisfaction to facing reality."
5,Cello Concerti,a smoothly played performance of rarely heard pieces for cello and orchestra. performance is well done. good selection of pieces
4,"Great book, fascinating topic.","I'm halfway through this book, and really enjoying it. I am in a MPH program, and this book has gone into more depth on the subject of the urban built environment that I got in class when we glossed over the subject in just a couple of lectures."
5,Compelling book that challenges convention,"The authors have brought together several disciplines in a compelling and convincing narrative that links the importance of urban planning for healthy living. The book contains striking data, stories and photos that show how closely the rise in obesity, diabetes and asthma (to name a few) have been linked to increasing urban sprawl. One of the main results of urban sprawl is increased time spent driving which not only increases stress but the time spent in gridlock traffic reduces family time and community involvement. The result of spending so much time commuting is much more severe than many people realize because it results in exhausted, anxious and stressed people who have little time to their children and neighbors, or in the language of the book ""social capital."" I highly recommend this book for anyone who seeks to see healthier cities that are designed for people rather than cars."
1,Disappointing,"Since I started Muay Thai about 6 months ago, I got very interested in reading this book, both based on the title of the book and the reviews on Amazon.The title of the book is somehow deceiving, and the reviews were probably written by people who never practiced Muay Thai or just started a week ago. The book really doesn't teach you any strategies besides the obvious (if you have a physical strong opponent, be elusive and get him tired kinda stuff..), and as a beginner with more then 4 weeks experience, this will not teach you anything new.Poorly spend 20 bucks or so.."
2,Lousy Insights,As a professional Muay Thai instructor under Surasute Surachai...I am not impressed....pretty common sense unless you are a Beginner...Study with a certified Muay Thai instructor for insights....this book was bought for a student...after reading the other review Hypes...got nothing out of this book...
4,Fighting Strategies of Muay Thai : Secrets of Thailand's Box,"BOM LIVRO, MUITO ILUSTRADO,DETALHADO MAS CONTUDO FALTARAM MAIS INFORMAES SOBRE PROJEO E NO SE PRENDEU A TÉCNICAS AVANADAS E É O QUE ESTÁ FALTANDO EM VÁRIOS outros livro de muay thai que possuo."
4,A good source for opera plots and history,"Although this book does not cover many less popular operas (the Grove encyclopedia of Operas is much more complete), it does cover around 250 operas, giving history, premier information, and the plots."
5,Early Hits,"There are more complete compilations out there for the Temptations, but this one has their early hits that are missing from other greatest hits and best of... packages."
3,Ordering Toys from Amazon and winding up with Brybelly,"I was very disappointed to learn that Amazon migrated me to another vendor for this product - Brybelly! It was several days after placing order when I was informed that product would not be shipped until after Christmas - very inconvenient and unacceptable. Then, I had to scramble when I thought this was one thing off my list. I was left to deal with a discourteous customer service rep in order to cancel as I was forced to purchase elsewhere. Never again, in addition, this kind of soured me on dealing with Amazon also. Three out of four orders this holiday were a bad experience. Too bad!"
5,Great Baseball/Business Story,"This was an absolutely great read. I had a hard time putting the book down. This was a great story about Billy Beane, and his running of the Oakland A's. It's great to read about guys like Billy who can dominate an industry because they put some thought and intelligence into their job, rather than just by gut feeling. As a reader, I found myself rooting for Billy while reading the book, because he had a thought process behind what he did. This was my first Amazon Prime Lending Library read, and I hope my next one will be just as good!"
5,great book for a sports fan,This book is well written. It reads very easily. If you like baseball you will like this book. Highly reccomend for others to read.
3,moneyball,"kinda interesting for the first third of the book, then just more of the same and it got boring and I didn't finish the book."
5,One of the best business books I've ever read,"I picked this book up, thinking it would be a great sports read. It turned out to be one of the most insightful business books I've ever read - whose principles can be applied to valuing businesses, real estate, individuals (baseball, in this case - but also football recruiting, which is my passion).Michael Lewis captured so much in this great book!"
3,Great as a gift,I bought this for myself and found that there was too much detail in how the game is played to be of interest to someone who does not have a passion for the sport. Be careful if buying this for a younger person as there were many incidents of harsh language. Would make a great gift for someone who really enjoys the sport and wants to understand the business and strategy behind it.
4,Read before seeing movie,"i am reading this before I rent or download movie. I wanted to read after I had seen the author, Michael Lewis had given his commencement address at his Alma Mater"
4,"Worth the price, engaging, entertaining, relaxing","I agree with the reviewer who said this is a good baseball book for the casual baseball fan. This book gives the best, least complicated explanation of sabermetrics that I've read. I take this book with me on plane rides, because I find the first two-thirds engaging and relaxing. (The last third fawns over Beane and his team of undervalued players -- the part about how Ken Williams is hesitant to take Billy Beane's phone calls, for fear of what sneaky trade the wily Billy Beane is going to trick Williams into taking -- a bit annoying, especially to a Sox fan, so I never read that part.)"
3,Moneybook: The art of writing so much words,"I had high hopes of this book. Would it be another winner's story or would it be about statistics and plain baseball?Actually, the result is kind of both. The book tells us about taking a different approach at scouting while the club is money-strapped. It makes you look beyond the obvious and I must say I had some great results in the Yahoo Hockey League online. But is this the result you go for?Moneyball is full of statistics and tells us a nice but not compelling story. You kind of read your way through it and say: ""Well, ok, that's nice to know.""If you got any spare time and like baseball or scouting go ahead and read the book. Just don't expect too much as I did."
3,Good writing expected something different then I purchases,"Thought this was going to be something different then what I purchased. It is a book of strategy, numbers and theories. I thought it would have more of story to it. My fault not the authors' fault. Didn't finish not my cup of tea."
5,"Great book review on: ""Moneyball""","Great book review on: ""Moneyball"" by Michael Lewis from We Blog the World. [...]Moneyball is hardly a new book. Written in 2003, it's back in the spotlight these days as anticipation builds for the Brad Pitt-starring movie adaptation in September. But while sports and Hollywood might be the big focus these days, there are several lessons start up owners can take away from the story.For the rest of book review click here [...]"
4,"For fans of small-market low budget MLB teams, this is","a revelation. My Pittsburgh Pirates would be wise to try to copy some of the strategies of the Oakland A's of ten years ago. Now that the movie version is almost here, I hope fans who missed the book when it first came out, as I did, will go find a copy. The middle third is pretty dry statistical reading, but the opening and closing thirds are quite satisfying. For anyone who dreamed of being good at baseball despite being short, beefy, too thin, too slow, no good on defense, or great in fielding but poor at hitting, this is quite fascinating."
3,I got a little lost,"I love a good sports story/movie, though I do not watch nor participate in any sports except for big events like the Olympics, super bowl et. I am not a baseball person, didn't see the movie, but got very confused. I had heard that you didn't need to know anything about baseball to find this to be a good book, but I think it might be helpful. I got the basic premise, I think, but it was full of stuff that I just didn't care about."
4,!Wisdom of the crowds,Lewis yet again demonstrates that careful analysis of the data can lead to unfashionable views and methods which are nevertheless right. Finance and sport are no different in this regard. Truth ultimately triumphs over truthiness.
2,Moneyball,- Gives a small kick - not a big one! Anyhow I can recommend this one to people who are familiar with baseball.
4,A Good Book,I enjoyed this book and was left to wonder to what other applications this would apply. I would read another by Michael Lewis.
4,Liked it,Good book. All the calculations made baseball most interesting. There is no need to require length in my review. Done.
4,For More of Everyone Than You Might Expect,"This is a great book for anyone who is in anyway interested in any proffesional sports. It gives great narration through the drafting process and there are many parts in the book that require thinking which is almost always a plus. With the way it is written, it really places the reader in the situation; great writing. You don't need to be an A's fan or evena big fan of baseball to enjoy this book."
5,On The Money,"I have been a baseball fan all my life. I have never read a better book on the business of baseball. If you have wondered why the Oakland A's seem to keep uncovering new talent to replace that which they lose to free agency - READ THIS BOOK! Michael Lewis does more than explain this phenomenon he tells a compelling story. The book is well investigated and extremely well written. This book makes so, so much sense. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANY SPORTS FAN."
1,Numbers numbers numbers,"The most important number in baseball is World series won. How many does Beane have...none. He hasnt even made it to the pennant games yet and they way things are going the A's never will if Beane is the GM. Thier window of oppurtunity passed when the ""overpaid"" and slick fielding (which doesnt matter to Beane) Derek Jeter threw out the overweight and slow Jer. Giambi at the plate on a great play in 2001. The As would be bottom rung if not the the 3 hammers they have in the rotation, non of whom were picked out of the crowd by Beane. Everyone knew that Hudson, Zito and Mulder would be very good. Groupthink has obviously taken a hold of most of the reviewers, who all seem to say the same things. ""OBP is important, Ks are important, not making an out blah blah"" and so on as if everyone in the baseball world doesnt know that. Looks like Beane pulled another fast one on all the people who rushed and bought his book."
1,MONEYBALL,HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE READING MONEYBALL AND HAVE NO PAGES 209-224 IN THE COPY THAT AMAZON SENT TO YOU? I WAS ENJOYING A QUIET WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SPEEDING ALONG THIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK AND SUDDENLY AT THE END OF PAGE 208 THERE IS PAGE 225. WHERE IS QUALITY CONTROL AT THE PUBLISHER AND AT AMAZON?
1,Lewis Played Like a Banjo,Michael Lewis seems unaware that the A's front office is hamming it up in front of him. Poor journalism if he couldn't figure it out.
3,Too many f-bombs,"The author felt the need to use the F-bomb way too often, once per page in some sections. Not to mention the S-word. If you love the f-bomb and other profanities, no worries, I'm just warning readers who prefer not to read such things or give it as gifts.Other than that, this book was good, but not great. I'm a big baseball fan, but there was too much detail about trading and stats even for me. It could have been at least 100 pages shorter without leaving any important info out. This is one of those rare cases where I'd say the movie is definitely better. The fictionalized version is just a lot more fun and interesting because it doesn't feel like someone is trying to sell you on fact that aren't really facts."
5,Terrific And Not About Me Me Me!!!,"They used to call me ""Moneyballs"" in college so when I noticed this on the best seller list at the local independent, I got more than a little excited. Alas, I was to be surprised by yet another book NOT about Heavy Hop Dop. This is a book about my favorite sport! Baseball. And a good one too. It reads fast and even amuses in places. I'm not an A's fan (even if I did get all A's in school), but this ""Moneyball"" is an entertaining read. Play balls! HHD."
4,Like It,Great book for the truly inspired baseball person. If you anything about Billy Beane and the Oakland A's this is the book for you. You really have to want to know what happens behind the scenes and off the field.
5,Can't Put It Down,"If you are a fan of the statistics of the game, then this is for you. See how Billy Beane and cast completely redevelop how players are scouted and drafted. Without a big payroll, the A's are always contenders. How does he do it ?"
5,Baseball General Management theory and practice at its best,As behind the scenes and informative as one can get regarding putting together a top notch baseball team with bottom level money.
3,Enjoyed,It was very interesting to read how a small market team can with good management play with the rich teams and win.
4,Fantastic,Great book that will change the way you think about baseball. All the things that you thought never mattered do.
4,Extra bases,Really enjoyed it. Tapped into the inner sports geek in me. More than the baseball was not getting trapped into stale thinking. Strong strong effort
4,moneyball,Moneyball by Micheal Lewis is a very good listen about a subject the average guy knows zilch about. The subject is management. Management is where you find it or choose to find it. The difference between an amature and the pro is the willingnees to apply mordern management tools.
2,not so good,This book is more about statistics than baseball. I found it somewhat boring. I was hoping more of a baseball story using the moneyball theory.
4,Moneyball,Excellent read for any sports fan. You do not need to know much about baseball to enjoy this book. In fact many of the principles outlined could be used in business or other aspects of life.
5,Extremely Insightful,"I give Moneyball on the basis that it's reader is either a devout student and fan of the game such as myself, or someone who is big into small-business ownership. Yes, Lewis does add some ""filler"" to his novel by adding life stories and background to Bradford and Hatteberg, but at the same time this builds the psychological models of what exactly it means to be an ""Oakland A"" in Beane's model. The only real complaint I have with the novel is wanting more. A must read for any true baseball fan."
5,Moneyball,"In short, if you follow the oakland A's, you will love this book. If you follow baseball closely, you will love this book. A fan of baseball will like it. A casual observer may find parts boring."
3,wrong subject,"The mathematics of sports...not a very good subject...Given MLewis talent for writing, his effort on the pro sports world seems a waste ... I'd rather see him write about finance, or computer geniuses....This was the least interesting of his books."
3,"a single, not a home run","This book reads more like an overlong magazine article than a well-written book. Michael Lewis is not a great writer, and his theme -- that baseball teams can be better managed by objectively weighting the contribution of various player attributes, such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage -- is informative but not earth-shattering. As an Oakland A's fan, I gained some insights from this book. But was it worth the $11 I paid for it? Not really."
1,"Dull, dull, dull.","I've read several books in the psychology/economics/statistics mould, and thought I'd enjoy this after seeing some of the five star reviews - many of which claim that you don't have to be a massive baseball fan to enjoy the book. However, after grinding my way through ninety pages, I finally gave up.I genuinely found this one of the most tedious books I have ever (tried to) read. The writing style contains no flair or wit whatsoever, and I cannot see how anyone but the most obsessive baseball freak could enjoy reading about an assortment of obscure players, scouts and journalists - none of whom really seem to do anything of interest. Beane himself seems a mildly interesting character, but the dull as ditchwater writing style kills the book stone dead.Don't understand any of the hype over this book. One star - but only because I can't give it none at all."
4,A must-read for any baseball fan.,"How did Billy Beane consistently win 101 games a year with a payroll 1/2 that of the Red Sox and 1/3 that of the Yankees? It couldn't all be luck. According to Moneyball, it wasn't.While it is a must-read for baseball fans, non-baseball fans will enjoy this well-written David over Goliath tale as well."
5,Has This Changed Baseball?,That answer of course is yes. This was a great book that changed how baseball teams are runned. One of Billy Beane's follewers Theo Epstien has just won a World Series with the redsox. Billy Beane made stats like OBP and OPS more popular for teams to look into when putting together teams. now that sounds like a book for just baseball stat geeks but this is a book for everyone.Michael Lewis writes about following the Oakland A's for a season and does it in an entertaining way for the stat geeks and a casual fan. From Billy Beanes new way of drafting to his way of implementing stats into finding cheap talent on the free agent market. It even gets one to know Billy Beanne as a failed baseball prospect turned Gm. This book was a terrific read and I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Excellent read for those who love statistics,"I'll preface this by saying I HATE sports, all sports, but I love this book. The true basis of this book is a story of sticking it to the ""good old boys"" club by using pure hard facts, science, and statistics. It is really hard to believe these people were so dumb set in their ways to try to stop the introduction of fact into the sport of baseball. There's plenty of solid back story and scientific information to keep any non-sports fan interested especially since they approach baseball from an analytical perspective and not a sport perspective."
2,Not really for non-baseball lovers,"I read reviews that claimed this story was great for those who are not baseball fans. I wish I could agree. I'm not particularly a baseball fan, but wanted to know what all the hype about this book (and movie) was all about. I liked the first few chapters, but then very quickly got bogged down in unfamiliar references and statistics. I hate to not finish a book, and I tried for days to get through to the end, though it started to seem very repetitive mid-way through and my eyes began to gloss over the pages without enthusiasm. Ultimately, I gave up a few chapters short of the end. Just not enough here to keep my interest. I think I'll just watch the movie to find out the end."
3,"If you're not a baseball fan, please give this book a pass","First of all, I must admit that I have been one of Lewis' fans since his classic Liar's Poker. How could I miss this one which Tom Wolfe described on the inside back cover as Lewis' grandest tour de force yet? However, being a Chinese trader who's ignorant about baseball, I could only complete the first two chapters (42 pages out of 288) and put it down. The large amount of baseball jargon and player name just stopped me from reading onwards. In fact, this review is written with the sole purpose to warn fellow Lewis' fans that this book, unlike his previous ones, require readers of certain knowledge and interest of baseball. If you're not a baseball fan, I strongly suggest you to give this book a pass."
3,Slightly over hyped?,Started off brilliantly but I felt it seriously tailed off in the middle and only slightly recovered by the end. I think I just expected a bit more. Definitely worth a read though if you are a sports fan.
4,"Hudson, Mulder, Zito are the heroes","Moneyball is a worthwhile read. I found the first half of the book to be very interesting (sabermetrics, Bill James, etc.) However, I found the second half of the book to be insulting- esprcially the way manager Art Howe was portrayed. Michael Lewis made this man with 30 years of baseball experience out to be a puppet and yes-man. I wondered if the book was proof read and edited by Billy Beane himself.I think Tim Hudson's name is mentioned once while Mark Mulder and Barry Zito never were. If not for these three starting pitchers, the A's would have acheived little success and the book would have no basis for being written. Credit the A's winning directly to these three arms moreso than sabermetrics.Intersting book but don't believe evrything you read."
4,Great book about the business side of sports,"I'm what you would consider a business focused person who loves sports. If this describes you, then you will really like this book."
4,Really Good Book (if you're a baseball fan),"Being a baseball fan, I liked this book a lot. I especially enjoyed the chapters on the 2002 draft and the trade deadline dealings for Ricardo Rincon. I thought Michael Lewis had a lot of detail that would quench the thirst of any die-hard fan, especially of a Oakland A's fan. Sometimes I had to read sections twice because there were so many players being named, but I didn't mind that.I did wind up googling all the players to find out where they ended up - I wanted to know how right Billy Beane was. Turns out, he's pretty smart. I would recommend this book to any baseball fan, not just an Oakland fan.And for anyone who doesn't believe in the importance of On-base-percentage....*sigh* you're not a real fan are you?"
4,For 150 years they got it wrong,"I'm not a big baseball fan, but how the Oakland A's were able to beat teams with such a small payroll was very interesting. The movie was excellent, so I decided to read the book and I was not disappointed. They had a secret. The good ol'boys of baseball were doing things the wrong way for 150 years and they refused to evolve. Nerds figured out the best way to put a team together, but baseball hicks ostracized them because they couldn't handle the truth. Moneyball is about the science of baseball, and the struggle to change the culture of an industry. The new discoveries about baseball mixed with conflicts between colorful characters, such as Billy Beane, makes a great read."
3,Moneyball,"A different look into baseball theoryMoney. Wanted to hear more about different players, possible trades, and more about the draft."
4,Liked the additional detail in the book (compared to the movie),"I saw the movie and then read the book. I liked the movie and then really enjoyed the additional detail found in the book. Loved that Lewis features Jamie Moyer during part of the book and thought the author does a nice job with the mental side of the game for hitters and pitchers alike, in addition to the sophisticated statistical analysis he makes accessible. Any baseball fan who also reads should read this book regardless of whether she or he sees the movie. I mentioned Moyer specifically because I was always a big fan of his, but all of the players on whom Lewis focuses have interesting stories and unique styles of play. Meanwhile, Billy Beane was at it again in 2012 with another low budget, lousy-looking-on-paper A's team in the playoff hunt against the odds, even after the whole world had a chance to watch Brad Pitt give away his secrets on the big screen."
3,Interesting read,Interesting read but best if you haven't already seen the movie which is pretty true to the book. Does open your eyes to seeing baseball in a different light.
5,Contrarian Explained,"I was raised and live in Texas where I was a Terrible little league baseball player who watched my friends play high school baseball during off season football. Now as a Dad of several sons, none of whom were devoted baseball players, I enjoy that the Rangers are good, admire Nolan Ryan and Ron Washington and have been to some games. But this book lit my fire. It glorifies baseball and makes it much more relevant to life outside of the game of baseball ,or outside of any game. It glorifies rightfully those who have the urge and nerve to imagine and create despite the resistance of inertia and obstacles. And, coming across it so long after publication enables a look at reaction and rancor of those so bent on a system that they refuse to consider another. This is a wonderful book by an excellent writer!"
4,"Fun, insightful read","I read Moneyball at the suggestion of a respected colleague. My typical choice of books tend to be more technical, and often feels like work. Lewis' Moneyball though was like taking the afternoon off. But don't be mislead into thinking you won't get much out of it. Lewis expertly takes you inside the game, offering keen insight at the same time. I now look at business and government indicators in a new light, and I don't take any of them for granted as I often did prior to this book."
5,Once upon a time in professional baseball,"there was a general manager of the A's. He had all the physical talent he needed to become a great professional baseball player, yet he was defeated by his own mind when he went up to bat. While those around him with less physical gifts rose to greatness, he took the less-travelled road of baseball administration. This book starts by contrasting the man's entry into professional baseball and his entry into a new paradigm in the art of picking the right players for a professional baseball team. It seems to be continuously answering the question: what makes a professional baseball player successful? In this book the author notes the attributes that made the main character falter whereas his peers (e.g. Daryl Strawberry) went on to greatness. Wonderfully entertaining book for which I made time to read every night."
4,From the midwest,"The book is a great read and Lewis does an excellent job describing the situation with Beane and the Oakland team. Beane is a winner and the book justifies his management style and reasoning to achieve success. One of the better books on baseball and the management of people, sports stars to be exact. Not for the baseball lover but for everyday people who like a good read............"
4,I really like this book,"I had the fortune of reading this book a while back and it's great. The epic story of a man versus the world is quite well told and I was gripped throughout the book. Yes, it is a book about statistics, but it's more about taking on the system and changing the world.I especially like how Billy Beane told the old scouts they were being ridiculous by judging ""athlete's"" based on non-statistical principles like girl-friends or looking soft.Good book, I highly recommend it."
5,Incredible. -- epitomology and baseball hand N hand.,"Though I've had it longer, I'm still rooted 'bout 1/2 way through 'The Big Short'; not so, 'Moneyball'.Lewis lofted the ball out of the stadium with one swing of the pen. If you ever wished you took aphilosophy course N college but didn't, read 'Moneyball'. All the philosophy you need N one enjoyableread. I've always thought, but been afraid to voice the intuitive notion I harbor that there exists acollegial affection between these two, seemingly disparate, specialties.Regarding 'The Big Short', I think I need a picture-book 4 neophytes to give me both a conceptualand a perceptual feel viz a viz the subject of financial instruments. Oddly enough, I think I almost graspedthe concept of the 'derivative' when I read 'Moneyball'.gunnerThrax"
3,Very good - too long,Very good book. I love Michael Lewis. My only complaint is that it was a little more long (and in-depth) than I would have liked. I started losing interest. Overall though good book and good movie.
5,Leadership Classic,"Lewis's MONEYBALL is impossible to put down because it is speaks as much to leadership as it does to baseball. The key premise is that instead of worrying about what you do not have, do all you can with the resources you do have.Worthy of its praise and glowing reviews. A great read."
4,Moneyball,Interesting view of baseball mgmt and how in depth analysis is superior purchasing a winning team in the free (?) agent market
5,Myself a ball player,"I could relate to this book because I was the guy who had a knack for getting on base, but coaches overlooked for 'better looking' players. Have an open mind when reading this book and you will enjoy it."
3,Decent,It's a decent book. I like the first half of the book and how they go into the development of looking at other stats. Later in the book it seemed to drag and become a Billy Bean against the world mentality.
4,A very interesting book and main character,"Though I'm not a baseball fanatic, I found this book really interesting from a business management point of view. It makes you think that there is probably a science for everything. I came in knowing little about the characters themselves, who were not as confident as I anticipated, and I even felt bad for some of the major league players."
3,another stupid review,this book was delivered wirelessly to my kindle the book came through just fine the books content was not to my liking
4,"Interesting, but...","As a researcher, I am both interested and biased toward the Oakland A's approach. Lewis, the author, when explaining the approach, does an excellent job for the most part. The emphasis on OBP makes intuitive sense.Where I begin to have difficulty with the book is it's long, drawn-out character development with the major ""players,"" especially Billy Beane as a ball player. Sadly, I started skipping pages to get to the meat.I am not finished with the book yet. I am hoping for more on the system and how the A's make player decisions based on it."
3,Great,Great story of how to overcome the obstacles that you face in life. very well written and a fun read
4,Moneyball,A good read even though I am not much of a baseball fan. I may read more Michael Lewis in the future.
5,Just FANtastic!,Great insight into the mind of a genius GM of a small-market team who assembled a championship caliber team from discarded parts no other team deemed worthy.
1,Figures lie and liar's figure,"There is a saying ""If you torture the data long enough, you can get it to admit to anything"". Michael Lewis starts with the premise that Billy Beane is the best and smartest GM in baseball, then butchers the statistics to make it seem so.It's simple, the A's don't win so many games with a minimal payroll because of their on base pct. or because Billy Beane outsmarts his fellow GM's constantly. They win because they drafted (before Beane) three of the best youngs starting pitchers in baseball.A fact that gets amazingly little mention in the book.Predictions:A) When Zito, Mulder, and Hudson become free agents; Beane will will become a free agent right along with them and leave. B)When the before mentioned pitchers leave, the A's will stink, no matter how many pitches Scott Hatteberg takes."
5,A worthwhile read even for non sports fans,"I've never followed baseball much, but have always been fascinated by the obsession with statistics in the game. The curious disconnect, which Lewis addresses in fascinating detail, is how it's taken so long for those managing the teams to put all of this raw data to use.So much of the spirit of baseball is romance, intuition and emotion. But these days the stakes are too high with many millions invested in a team to compete without every edge available at your disposal. Billy Beane and the A's have forever changed the game of baseball, and it's great to read about when and how the revolution started.A true investigator, Lewis also recognizes the weaknesses of Beane's breakthrough approach to baseball and how, even though it may greatly increase the odds for a winning season, the strategy comes somewhat unraveled at playoff time."
4,"Review Lewis, not Beane","Before I read this book, I came to Amazon to learn whether people thought Michael Lewis had done a compelling job telling Billy Beane's story. I didn't come to find out what baseball fans think of Beane as a GM (which is the substance of many reviews here). Now that I have read it, I can report to the rest of you that it is very worthwhile, if you want to know how the business of baseball is conducted these days.Whether you agree with Beane's strategy or not, this book will take you inside the life of a GM like nothing else I've read. Lewis's past experience writing about tense business situations clearly helps him set the scene for the MLB amateur draft and all the preparation that comes before it. So leave your fan hat behind, and use your reading glasses instead."
1,SLO-O-O-O-W,"Bought one for my Treo 650. Read speed seems OK, but the write speed is horrible! When using voice recording software, the card was too slow to properly write the .wav files, and everything I recorded was garbled and useless. When doing my daily data backup, the process took at least 10x as long as with my SanDisk card. Even the garbage no-name card that I got free with my Treo is dramatically faster.I hate to admit it, but it never even occurred to me that there could be such a dramatic difference in quality in such a simple product. I will never buy anything but SanDisk again!"
4,Great Survival Ration Plus,I made a point of trying some first before ordering enough for my Bug Out Kits. Actually like the lemon flavor and found that they did not make me as thirsty as eating an MRE. Have two packs per car kit and carry them in our ATV's for emergency's. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the packaging has not held up to bouncing around in an ATV box.
3,Better that starvation,"If you have gluten sensitivity or are diabetic, you are out of luck. I am neither, but I did get a bit of a sugar spike when I tried one. I pray I never have to rely on these as my main source of food for any length of time. Its not that they taste bad. Its really like a thick but fairly dense shortbread cookie but not hard to chew. The texture breaks apart fairly easily. So imagine having to live off of a chunky shortbread cookie for every meal. The first one was ok when I was hungry, but meal after meal? I think I would vomit after a few meals of this. But if I was facing starvation, I think I could put up with it."
1,not food,"Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors. For someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic, this would be a poor substitute for real food. I personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing. Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU."
3,Pretty top notch for what it is,"I purchased a packet of these for a lightweight and handy meal for packing in the woods. The taste is fine as advertised. This isn't a three star based on this being just a snack, however. They are survival rations, not just some kind of nosh. I would not choose to eat these as a snack as they are rather dense, and despite claims to do make you thirsty; just as eating anything bread-like will make you thirsty.There is also an aftertaste that, while not strong, will make your mouth continue to taste the lemon-bar you just ate for as long as it takes you to drink enough water to wash it down.I would rather have an MRE, but the compact and portable nature as well as the price makes this a good item for extreme light hiking."
1,They're selling old packets,The five year shelf life is impressive. Too bad it arrived with about 30 days left on that.Why do they think someone would order these and intend to eat them almost immediately?
4,Good Overall,"Overall, this case is pretty good. I like the look of it and it keeps my ipod well-protected. It is very well made and has quality parts (such as the magnetic snap closure.) The only downsides, which are not that major, are that you can't charge it while in the case. But this actually can be good because the hole would have to be large, leaving a large portion of the ipod ""exposed."" Also, the front panel that covers it can occasionally get in the way when playing games and such. In addition, it does come with a screen protector but put it on carefully because once its on, air bubbles and such are hard to remove even after it is reapplied.Great product overall!"
2,not nearly as radical or disturbing as it claims,"While short and fairly entertaining, the author seems to be more impressed with himself than he should be. Many claims are totally unsupported generalizations; the perspective is similar to that given in The Satanic Bible, but I'd say that LaVey said it better and more explicitly. Other similar perspectives may be found in Colin Wilson's writings on crime and the criminal mind."
3,"Entertaining, but hardly enlightening.","Every once in a while, I get sick of the pollyanna and want to read something whole-heartedly negative. This book fit the bill. It is easily digestible and fun.The previous reviewer was right in saying Hyatt is no genius. He is an elitist who, like most of them, can't seem to put his money where his mouth is.The book is not toxic. It is not unbearable. It is not going to shatter your world-view and recreate it in one fell swoop. However, IMO, it is not complete waste. It's entertaining ... in the way the a professional wrestler's rant could be entertaining if he had an IQ and babbled about social psychology from a nihilist's point of view."
1,A deadly book! (Deadly boring),"Frankly I grew very tired already during the foreword and the introduction almost sent me to sleep. If I read comments by the author to the effect that the book is evil and destabilizing etc etc I expect to be in for and exciting read. This was sadly not the case, I'm not sure what I expected but this book sounds more like an attempt by the author at some kind of self glorification. I thought that apart from the turgid sections there were other parts which were just childish and silly! Sorry Mr Hyatt you are not a Macchiavelli or a Nietzsche or a Crowley and never will be. It would have been better stylewise if an expert editor had had a go at it but the author pointed out that no editor would touch it due to its dangerous nature, yeah right! more likely they could smell garbage!"
4,"Well-thought out and expressed, and yet?","I *will* probably quote from this book in the future. I * have * already mentioned this book to my friends. The truth is in there--nasty but accurately expressed. If you're already of a slightly negative bent--this book might straighten you; if you're an incureable optimist, it just might fix you. But all the same, I can't exactly say it's all news to me. Once you read it, you may well find yourself thinking the same--but will you like yourself when you do? It's a thought-provoker, and fun."
4,Effective Chop Saw,"I recently purchased this chop saw and found that it performed as well as I expected. The motor seemed to handle the 2 inch conduit that I was cutting without a hesitation. The model DW871 had a nicer miter setup, head locking system and a clamping handle but for the purpose that I bought the saw and the amount of use it will get, this one for the money should perform everything that I need."
3,Doesnt cut bricks,"I like this saw alot, and expect good quality from the Dewalt name. My only problem is that it doesnt cut bricks well. I bought separately a masonry blade, and it works ok til about 1/2 way through the 3"" brick. Hoping that i dont have to buy an expensive diamond wheel blade."
3,BROKEN PARTS,"The saw appears to be a good one, however, upon opening the original box, found the end of the securing screw/plate for the item to be sawed broken into several pieces."
4,i'm going to buy this for christmas presents!,"how many times have i looked in the refrigerator and wondered what i could possibly fix for dinner? i could already hear the kids---tuna casserole, again? what about chicken? could i bake it with italian dressing again and feel excited about it? this is the cookbook for which i have been hunting. all i have to do is look up ""tuna"" and there are ten new, quick, and good ways to serve it. chicken thighs the cheapest chicken to buy? look under chicken thighs and there's caesar corn crunch chicken, spicy bbq chicken, pizza parmigiana chicken, and, sure enough, chicken thighs with italian dressing. now i know my kids will eat what's in this book and, maybe, i can get them to try something new."
3,Not Great but OK,"I love how the chickens taste with this, but I noticed it took longer to cook a chicken in the Showtime than in the oven. I also had the problem of the leg joints being raw when the rest of the chicken was cooked. It cooked salmon very good.The machine also did squeek after the first few uses but if you oil the sides where you slide the rotisserie part on, it stops making noise. You just have to keep doing it each time before you cook something. I didn't like how it cooked steak. It kind of stewed it.Also Ronco rips you off to get elastic chicken ties. They charge $15.00 plus shipping for a packet of 100 ties. $15.00 for chicken ties? Greedy."
2,Can hear your chicken scream!,"This Rotisserie is a gift from underworld. Despite trying many different combinations we can not make it to operate silently. It creates a high pitch eerie screaming sound that disturbs even our neighbors! Gloves that came with it melted, it is very hard to clean, and definitely not worth the money paid Avoid at all costs!"
2,"OK, But If It Breaks ...","I bought mine years ago. It's a good little machine, and served well, but it just stopped working one day. There were no appliance repair shops in our city authorized to work on these machines, and when I called their 800 number, they were absolutely no help. They had no resources to find repair shops and offered no repair services of their own. So even if the machine is good, if you can't repair it, you might be out a lot of money just after the warranty expires, and filling landfills with small appliances stikes me as wasteful. I'll be looking elsewhere for my next purchase."
2,Might-Makes-Blah,"I just got In The Shadow Of The Sword and have already listened to it several times and I am surprised by how disappointing it is. I was expecting something a bit more powerful but it sounds like the live portion was recorded in the lobby of the venue with the doors closed. The whole thing is just bass, bass, bass. It's all muffled! It's hard to hear the points Boyd is trying to make and when you can understand him he sounds like he couldn't care less about what he's saying. If this album is supposed to be a summation of might-makes-right it falls way short. You're better off gettingStormtrooper Marchesor hunting down a copy of IL DUCE!: Songs Of Italian Fascism, 1922-1943."
4,How it takes me back? How it moves me still?,"I think Stevie Wonder is incredible. This Cd was hard to find for a long time. I love Master blaster( jammin')! I remember going to see Stevie on this tour. He was Magical! This to me is one of the last Chapters of a certain Style that began in 1970. That is an accomplishment in it's own right. Who today has a run of consistent excellence like that! I highly recommend this for any Cd collection, and most definitely if you like Stevie Wonder-"
5,A Classic,"This album is probably Stevie's last great complete album. It is classic--from the love songs to is ode to Martin Luther King, Jr. A ""must have"" for your Stevie collection."
5,Great Album,"While Stevie's Albums at Best since this One have been Up&Down this one was Very Complete.The Music&Lyrics are Solid From Start To Finish.All I Do With Michael Jackson is a Gem.Rocket Love is Great.Betty Wright,The O'Jays,The Gap Band all Sound Great.Happy Birthday is a Great Tribute To Dr.Martin Luther King JR.Jodeci did a Remake of Lately a few years back.Master Blaster(Jammin) a Great Tribute To Bob Marley.Fantastic from The Genius Mind Of Stevie Wonder."
5,WONDEROUS STEVIE! ! ! !,"Stevie the wonderful the delightful and always entertaining, would the world suffer without his brilliance? OF COURSE IT WOULD! In my mind he is without a doubt one of the most gifted musical talents to have ever lived!Hotter than july is HOT period! I love this album, definately one of my all time favourites, Stevie has such a rich powerful soulful and beautiful voice, that anyone with hearing will appreciate it, (and I dont mean with the ears either! )Excellent songwriting and brilliant lyrics give this album a slight edge over his other high quality works, I particularily enjoyed 'Happy Birthday' and 'Lately' which my poor old vinyl record has been mercilessly played over and over for the past several years!In my humble opinion any work with Stevie Wonder has got to be awesome so I wont hesitate in HIGHLY RECOMMENDING this album, it is pure listening pleasure, a worthy addition to anyones collection, SO GO OUT AND BUY IT! N O W ! ! ! !"
3,Below average for Stevie,"This is not the album to buy if you're wanting to have only one SW recording.Good, but not up to the standards of his other works.Do any of the selections seem to have stood the test of time?If so, which one?"
3,Best of,-Hulk Hogan vs. Randy Savage-Hulk Hogan vs. Greg Valentine-Hulk Hogan vs. The Big Bossman-Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant
5,Classic Set,"I got this almost 10 years back.this set has the long Version of ""Just to Be CLose To you""&that alone makes this a Must have.Now I would dig a Funk Set Dedicated to this Group because they could Jam as well.but after Lionel Richie's Slow-Cuts took over they became a Slow-Jam Group.these songs Here Highlight."
3,More for correctional officers than for the layman,"Definitely a good book, but more like a manual for how to deal with prisoners than a lighter pop-psych book. Was interesting nonetheless"
4,Games is right on the money,"I recommend this book to anyone that is thinking about working with inmates, I also suggest that they read the book before their first day of work. It will trully make them aware of how the inmates think. I look back at all of the officer's that I watched get walked off and thought if they had read this book it may not have happened. Even if you are a seasond officer I can promise you that while reading this book, at some point you will realize that you were targeted as a Duck, however if you are still working you recognized the signs. The only down fall of this book is that it is very repetitive, however, I feel it should be in order to get the point across ""Don't play the inmates game, you will lose""."
3,Good info but a little dated.,This book has alot of good information about the goings on behind bars but I found the presentation a little cumbersome and dated (book was originally published in the '80s). Reads a bit like a thesis paper to me but if you can stick to the style of writing you'll be rewarded.
5,Hustler Inoculation,"This book breaks down the most extreme forms of manipulationto their basic elements in a no-nonsense way.Though written for those employed in Law Enforcement, it isenlightening to anyone with the patience to explore generalprinciples of manipulation - familiar, friendly, romantic, urban,provincial, and professional."
3,"""Games Criminals Play""","In style and presentation, as well as the information presented, this book is directed (apparently) at the extremely naive. Is it because persons hired into the correctional systems are less educated, less mature and more gullible then those going into other areas of law enforcement?There was no index, and a glossary of prison jargon might have been useful.The first printing was in 1981. Shouldn't the book have evolved more in the subsequent 31 printings? Where are the sections on terrorist recruiting activities in prison?In the ""About the Authors"" section I was impressed by the experience of Bud Allen, and by Diana Bosta's ability to have her ""social welfare"" viewpoint prevail!I expected more.Warren Franks, CPP, Sgt., LASD, RetiredFormer Fiscal and Administrative Aide to LA County Jail Division Chiefs; at a time when that system was the second largest penal system in the United States."
3,Wish it was more scholarly,"This is truly an interesting read even if you don't work in corrections. Its a unique view of prison life that doesn't revolve around gang violence and prison rape. There are number of blanket statements like ""inmates respect guards who are fill-in-the-blank"". Maybe they do. I'd prefer to see some research into the matter. The book was written in 1981 and there hasn't been an update nor is there a bibliography or footnotes. Lastly, the 'praise' on the back cover is from a Dentist who doesn't work in corrections. Great that lots of reviewers found it helpful, but I want to see a book with some serious research on the topic. I would hesitate to bet my life on this book which this book claims you are doing if you do not follow its advice. Of course its in its 31st printing so its got some part of it right."
5,If you are working in corrections this book is a must,"I've been in the Jail bussiness now since 1996, and I can tell you that a read of this book will instantly give you a years expereince or better in the corrections proffession. It includes all the ""tricks"" that inmates and criminals use to ""get one over on you"" Since these people have nothing to do all day but dream up new crimes and manipulation techniques, the knowledge this book will impart will allow one to ""see them coming a mile away"". Reading this book will enhance ones safety both in the corrections environment and on the street."
4,A cute teddy bear novel,"this book will make you smile and giggle, as you relive moments you too have spent with a teddy bear, or growing up. Comforting and adorable stories for anyone with a passion for teddy bears."
1,Stop Removing Negative Reviews,or I will have Amazon remove this listing !Thank you Driver 9 and everyone else for stating your opinion again after your earlier reviews were removed . I find the fact that they were removed extremly disturbing .My earlier review was also removed because I stated that the books empty platitudes held no value for me . That is my truth . If someone else wants to read this book and say yes to whatever anyone representing MSIA writes that is their right as well .Peace and Blessings to All !
1,i am my true self,"I am so gratefuL THAT i do not need this book to align with my ""true self"" The book was recommended to me by a friend who is part of the MSIA movement(cult to some).There are many books of this ilk,some have merit . I would not say this is one of them but if you are a ""follower"",I can see where it would support that belief system."
3,Fun while it lasts,It was very fun while the batteries lasted. Unfortunately I can no longer find the batteries for this item. Not even from the seller.
1,Lousy,"This item did not work at all. I tried to use it once, was just lousy, garbaged it in 5 minutes."
4,quick start indeed,"This book takes you through the motions of using Visual C++ 6.0 to develop 2 programs - one completely trivial and the other a little more involved. But that's exactly what I needed. I needed to start using Visual C++ 6.0 pronto and didn't know where to start. This is the first time I've purchased a PDF download book. I ordered it yesterday for $2, downloaded it yesterday, and today I've finished working through the 2 examples. Now I'm up and running while I wait for a more comprehensive book to arrive."
2,THUMBS DOWN,"The first rating for this book is correct, but also insufficient.Although it only costs $2, I think this book was better off not being written, or atleast not published until the auther had time to add a bit more to it, and elaborate on what's already there. This is a very uninformative GUIDE TO MAKING A USELESS PROGRAM.I call it uninformative because the author does not explain the purpose/logic of the elements in his examples, only tells you to model your example the same way to achieve the same results. This is basically a How-To guide on making the simplest, must useless of programs. This book IS NOT an explanatory Tutorial.I give it 2-stars because someone who can TEACH THEMSELF from examples can learn A SMALL BIT from this book (not $2 worth). Otherwise, this is basically what should be the FIRST CHAPTER of a C++ quick-start guide, not the entire thing."
4,an invaluable volume for tropical divers and photographers,"I agree with the previous reviewers--an invaluable, scholarly, and readable work that discusses such interesting but poorly understood subjects such as why tropical fish tend to be brightly colored, how schooling fish swim in close coordination, and whether anemones benefit from their relationship with anemone fish. It's a shame that tropical dive operations haven't made this required reading for their dive students."
3,good deal,"the only downside is that a part of the motor fell of and stopped the fan. So when i was drilling, it got really hot and overheated. The motor wouldnt turn after that."
1,Destrucutive Stereotyping,"What a shame to have a ""game"" that perpetuates stereotypes about orphans and adopting.Another reason to dislike the whole ""American Girls"" brand.:+P"
3,"Bram Stoker's Dracula aside,","Arlington Road comes second as the scariest soundtrack I've heard. Although nearly the entire CD is based around a low, monotonous bass that never seems to shut up (reminicent of RIVEN), the recording dishes out several horrifically unpresedented explosions of music that usually forbode an equally exciting chase piece. I can't specify which track it does this in since they all sound the same and never have a very short interval of quiet when the next track begins, but I will say that if the composer were to trim a lot of the pointless themes and parts where there is almost no music (save the ever present bass) he would have a fairly decent soundtrack with merit. Instead it's an occasional thrill here, but not much above watching someone sweep the floor."
3,An OK product,Installed this on a 2001 V6 Camry. The wires fit but not as good as the OEM type. Needs some effort to make a secure connection at the ignition coil end.
3,Meditative and Thoughtful,"If you are looking for an adventure book--something along the lines of ""Into Thin Air,"" this is probably not the book for you. There's not much ""high drama"" in ""Rowing to Latitude,"" as John Freeman of the ""Wall Street Journal"" states and whose review is placed prominently on the front cover of the trade paperback version of this book.If you are looking for a more meditative, thoughtful book with the occasional kayaking/canoeing misadventure tossed into the mix, this is the book for you. Be prepared for a little environmental preaching by Fredston. I would have cut those sections if I had been the editor, but overall I found Jill Fredston's book to be engaging and I would recommend the book to other readers."
3,An Editor's Viewpoint,"I recommend that you take these reviews with a grain of salt. The stories told by author are quite exciting, but I think that some readers have let them overshadow the author's trite metaphors, frequent, not-so-subtle digs at her husband, and self-aggrandizing style that any editor worth her salary would have edited out in the first draft. The author actually compares herself to Mother Teresa at one point.If you are looking to read about adventure, try some real writers. Read ""The Places In Between,"" by Rory Stewart, or ""The Worst Journey in the World,"" by Apsley Cherry-Garrard. These are written with sensitivity, elegance, and complete lack of ego. Perhaps Ms. Fredston should have taken a look at these before dashing off her book."
5,An Armchair Traveler's Delight,"As a junkie of adventure travel books - especially those that feature the polar regions - I can highly recommend this work. I liked the author's intimate portrayal of her relationship with her husband and her refrain from romanticizing places she has visited. Ms. Fredston provides a refreshing view into an ""alternative"" lifestyle. She is one tough cookie."
1,Expecations fall flat,"This book is a great disappointment. It's set outdoors, with the exciting theme of rowing all along the arctic coasts. Sounded like it would be great.Unfortunately, one coast comes across as very much like the others. Despite encounters with whales underneath the boats and foraging bears, there is little excitement or wonder. The author speaks of long days of meditation. Yet none of this comes across. Rather, the impression is long days of boredom.I am left with feeling I know the author no better than before I started reading her book. The story sounded so promising, but it fell flat."
2,Fantastic voyage,"I picked up Ms. Fredston's book becasue I had visited the Yukon river and inland waterways of Alaska. She writes (or is edited) quite plainly and gives a wonderful travel itinerary with little bits of her feelings along the way. What I found most absent is the eloquence of description of the country and her formidable navigation with Doug Fesler, who seems only an appendage, albeit a deeply loved one. If this were only a ""see what I did"" magazine article, it would be appropriate, but not as a book. Perhaps reviewing each experience with more in depth would be appropriate."
5,"Rage becomes ""slow like glass as a verb""","Rage becomes ""slow like glass as a verb"" in this amazing collection of poems. I really enjoyed the insights into both the Korean and American cultures and languages, from a unique perspective. Where do people such as Asian adoptees fit into the narrative of America in general, and specifically Asian America, which has a long history, and isn't going anywhere but deeper? Read this book for beautifully-rendered clues."
3,Non-Score Mark Kozelek Songs,"The 3 Mark Kozelek tracks are available:""Lily & Parrots""""Carry Me Ohio""from the album ""Ghosts of the Great Highway"" by Sun Kil MoonGhosts of the Great Highway""Make Like Paper""from the album ""Songs for a Blue Guitar"" by The Red House PaintersSongs for a Blue GuitarMark Kozelek wrote and sings all 3 songs. He's been a member of The Red House Painters (now defunct) and Sun Kil Moon. I think at least one of the tracks above is available on a solo live recording, ""Little Drummer Boy Live.""Little Drummer Boy Live"
5,Strong and durable Split Key Rings,"These are really strong split key rings. The unit price is quite good when buying this pack of 100.I used to buy these individually from the local hardware store... which turned out to be relatively more expensive. I keep finding other ways to use them. Very handy to have these on hand when you need them.Here are the measurements for the ones I received:------------------------------------------------------------The hole measures 1"" wide.From end-to-end, including the metal, it is 1 1/8"" wide.I don't have calipers, but measuring with a ruler, the wire itself is approximately 1/16"" wide.Hope that helps.PROS:- Stainless steel- Strong and good quality.- Good unit price.CONS:- none"
1,False Advertising,"I ordered these Split Key Rings to attach items to my Scuba BCD because they were advertised in the description as stainless steel - wich they absolutely are not - stainless steel is not magnetic - these stick to a magnet just like regular carbon steel - they might last a couple of dives in saltwater, but a big waste of time and money"
1,flimsy,Broke quickly when cold. The individual sections flexed in relation to the top which held them all together and they broke apart.
4,Decent collection,"Quite a few of these stories are rather unsatisfactory, including the story this book got its title from, 'The Doctor's Sweetheart', a story I actually rather disliked. Other compilations - Road to Yesterday and Chronicles of Avonlea - are more satisfying reads than this. Not all of the stories reflect Ms. Montgomery's best or even usual work, but there ARE a few gems in here, especially 'The Garden of Spices'. For these few wonderful stories, this collection is worth the read, and is a must for any LM Montgomery fan."
2,Some stories are not worthy to mention,"If you have been reading other L.M. Montgomery works, this is definitely not a good choice to invest your money upon. Most of the stories seem senseless and not practical on real world situations. Other few mentionables is the title's short stories, 'The Doctor's Sweetheart' that is endearing as it tells about a doctor patiently waits for his sweetheart to come and 'The Promise of Lucy Ellen', a story about love given a second chance. Another story that is suprisingly fresh and funny is 'By Grace of Julius Caesar' about two maiden ladies who was scared onto roof by a bachelor's dog named Julius Caesar. An unexpected solution make the story sweet and enduring. This book maybe not worth your time, but a few fresh and witty short stories may cover the shortcomings."
4,One of a kind,"This is music that, with the exception of a few songs, did not fit the 80's mold. El Debarge is one of the best writers I can think of, and it's a shame he's not doing anything lately. He is what you call a writer's writer. Just as with other favorite writers of mine, I would sit and listen for hours to songs and pick apart the chords, melodies, and listen for all the little nuances in my favorite songs such as ""I Like It"" and All This Love"". Incidently, I'm looking for the latter, on tape or cd, I have the LP. Bottom line, this is great music."
4,AlmostGreat,"Musically, Debarge were superb. Their melodies were very intricate and vocally demanding. The arrangements were lush, yet very tastefully understated. El Debarge's vocally mastery is only surpassed by his song writing brilliance (chord progressions, melodic construction, etc, etc).So what? Most of that was lost on the world. So please, buy this CD for what it is, some of the most beautiful melodies ever created. These songs make today's typical RnB fare sound like folk ditties. My only small criticism is that ""My Life Begins With You,"" and ""Queen Of My Heart"" are not included. Other than that, Sublime."
5,Forget the reviews in Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews above,"The plotting in this book is absolutely outstanding. When the solutions come at the end, they are based -- as the Inspector puts it -- not on any new information but on information that they had all along.All the hints are there and open for the reader to see. When the Inspector explains all, the reader is left to kick himself for not having caught all (or even any) of the clues.Fair is fair, and this is one of the best."
3,Interesting DVD,Hi I'm 12 years old and have used this dvd several times. It is very informative and funny. There is no way you can learn all this disc has to offer in one sitting. It includes print out science pages and recipes. This program is easy to use and has several optional courses.
3,"Great, but lines are too dark","There's an alternate brand--can't remember which one, that is the same except it has much lighter lines on the pages. That's better because you can see what you write better. But this is an okay alternative--the other was out of stock. It lays flat, folds over, and holds standard letter sized papers tucked into it, which is handy."
4,Where is Sheryl?,"I agree with the review by Peter J. Calabrese. He also was dissapointed that Sheryl Crow's song played during the ending credits was not included in the ""HurlyBurly"" soundtrack. The song ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" is on her ""The Global Sessions"" CD. Great song and a pretty decent CD. Hope this helps."
4,Solid Country Rock Album,"Hadacol's ""Better Than This"" is a first rate alternative country album that unfortunately got lost in the shuffle somehow. These guys have a deft songwriting touch enlivened by a self-effacing sense of humor. The album's standout track is ""Big Tornado,"" in which the twister of the title track serves as a metaphor for a relationship gone bad. Other excellent songs include the redneck anthem title track, the road romance of ""Drive All Night,"" the rocker ""What You Wanted,"" and ""Poorer Than Dead."" The rest of the material isn't quite as strong, but the whole album holds up well. Fans of fellow Missouri bands The Bottle Rockets and Nadine ought to be right at home with ""Better Than This.""Overall, an excellent alternative country album that deserves a wider audience."
5,Outstanding Book,"This book really held my attention. Based on true human courage under dire circumstances, it is well written and hard to put down. The bibliography is very deep and the authors fully researched their topic."
4,Flag Placemat for Learning,"My kids (7 & 5) wanted to learn country flags and I searched for a small poster size color display for them. Happy with the purchase. Inexpensive, colorful, laminated and shows 186 country flags (labeled). The flags are small (size of postage stamps) so it couldn't be used on classroom wall necessarily, but has been useful for our at-home use. Kids like using flag flash cards (purchased elsewhere) & matching them to the placemat. Opposite side has the same flags unlabeled and in black and white. Could be used with dry erase markers."
3,Not quite all there,"It doesn't actually contain all the flags of the world... it's missing a considerable chunk of countries (although it does include some territories). The colors are quite faded, and don't look true to many of the countries' actual flag colors. It is, however, a decently cheap product, so I wasn't necessarily expecting superior color-matching."
1,Placemats--poor quality by Ruskin,Laminate already gave in after less than a month of not hard use. Got 6 in all-re-laminated all 6... Would love a credit-not enough money to go thru hassle of a refund-but buyer beware.
3,Good...but Lie to Me kicks this one around like nothing,"Good read, but i wouldn't call this ""Horror"". In the book, there are few deaths, and only one of them is scary. The sexual scenes really get to be too much at times, but you get used to it in Martin's novels. Nice, short read...but nothing more sadly. If you want something great, read Lie to Me."
2,BO,"NOT SO MUCH A REVIEW AS THE AUTHOR'S ATTEMPT TOMAKE SURE THAT RACE AND CURRENT OPINIONS OF THE OBSERVER DON'TINFLUENCE RESEARCH AND IMPRESSIONS OF OBSERVED GROUPS.WHILE ADMIRABLE, IT DIDN'T REALLY TELL ME WHAT ANTHROPOLOGY IS.IT ALSO SPENT A LOT OF TIME TELLING WHAT ANTHROPOLGISTS DID WRONGIN THE PAST, WHEN INFLUENCED BY RACIAL AND ""CURRENT CULTURE"" ARROGANCE.ALSO A LOT OF DESCRIPTION OF OF BASIC RESEARCH.REALLY DIDN'T GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY AT ALL, ANDCOMING FROM A MATH/PHYCIS BACKGROUND THIS WAS WHAT I WANTED.I AM CURRENTLY READING WINDOW ON HUMANITY BY KOTTAK WHICH ISACTUALLY A GOOD OVERVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY"
3,Sound specs review,"I bought my unit to do live 4 track recording using condensor microphones.I actually measured the harmonic distortion because I could hear it in headphones and on the stereo outs to a backup recorder. Basically the main L/R output level peaks must be kept below -12dB and channel levels below -6dB.The noise floor is below -100dB until the channel trims are past 3/4 of a turn then rapidly degrades. Higher output condenser mics can be directly connected (the unit has phatom power), dymanic mics should be run through an external mixer.The unit has a quirk in that you must reactivate phantom power on power on even though the menu says phatom power is on!"
2,worked for a while,worked for a while then started smokeing but still worked .....looks like a toy acks like a toy .....how cheap do they make recorders
2,Not fine jewelry,I was looking for some nice jewelry to give our 14 and 16 year old nieces. This is not it. This will end up as a present for the 10 year old niece because we got it at the Friday sale price of $12. If I had paid the $30 they ask for it regularly I would have been even more disappointed and asked for a refund.
5,WONDERFULLFILLING!,"Characters comes across right the first time you listen to it whether it is the the soothing melody of social awareness that is found in ""You will know""or the roaring umph that pulls the ""Skeletons"" out of your closet. Each beat of my heart is another one of those beautiful love songs that Stevie will make you sing and cry to. This song will definitley be played or sang at my wedding. The collaboration with B.B.King on ""Come let me make your love come down"" is slammin and rocking. AS so the hook-up with Michael Jackson on ""Get it"". Check out ""Free"" 1000 words can not describe this album it is a ""Galaxy Paradise"""
3,It's Okay,"While this is not my favorite Stevie Album, I love two songs and they are ""Skeletons"" and ""My Eyes don't Cry no more""!"
2,Painfully Mediocre,"Stevie, Stevie, Stevie!! Where has all the brilliance gone? There are exactly 3, count 'em, 3 good songs on this album and they simply aren't enough to salvage what amounts to a piece of pedestrian product and half-hearted attempts at sounding comtemporary. The opener, ""You Will Know"" with it's simple message of hope and lilting fairlight melody, ""With Each Beat Of My Heart"", his least syrupy ballad in years and the skeletal groove of ""Skeletons"" and it's indictment of liars, cheaters and cover-ups (Corporate America should really listen to this one nowadays) are the only worthwhile tracks here and it breaks my heart to listen to the rest of the garbage that makes up the remainder of this release. Filler is one thing, but this is ridiculous."
3,Characters needs soul,"When I read a bio on Stevie Wonder,many made a fuss about Songs In The Key Of Life being overdue since his last album(Fullfillingness..)came out two years earlier.Since then many of his album were years between releases.Characters came out a mere ""TWO YEARS"" after In Square Circle.At first listen it was Wonder-bliss.Unfortunately,repeated listens showed he should have taken more time with developing this one.No doubt Skeletons is a jam & a half,but many songs are mediocre(Get It<w/Michael Jackson>,Dark N' Lovely,Crying Through The Night,My Eyes Don't Cry)as well as downright ridiculous(Galaxy Paradise,In Your Corner).Others are worth a listen(You Will Know,With Each Beat Of My Heart,One Of A Kind),especially the buried nugget Free that salvage this mediocre mess."
4,good disc,"not on par with his 70's gems or hotter than july but still it has good moments such as you will know,get it with michael jackson and my eyes don't cry.steviw wonder is a musical treasure."
3,SSD Bracket,"Cheesy, but so is price. I have installed several SSDs and frankly, Velcro ""dots"" to stick them inside desktop case cover works perfect and is easy to service. They don't get hot, so they stick great."
4,Nice accesory,Worked like a charm. I had a laptop that died but the HD was intact. Added one of these to my Desktop chassis and got an additional 0.5 GB drive for backups. Very easy to install.
4,yoga fit pregnencyit,it is a very good program designed for pregnant women. i practice almost everyday and i have already felt the benefit of practicing. i feel more relaxed and calm during my pregancy.
5,love this,"This workout is mostly easy, but I love it. I don't have a problem doing this workout all the way through, even on my sickest days... and for me that makes it awesome. She isn't annoying at all and is very helpful with her suggestions. I feel a lot better after this workout/stretch."
4,Great for starters and/or 3rd tri,"Decided to purchase this DVD after reading other other reviews. As some have mentioned this is a basic yoga workout, which was perfect for me. I've done yoga here and there in the past, but am not a regular to it my any means. Plus, my first 18 weeks or so of pregnancy were pretty tough with lots of sickness so any exercise was few and far between, but I knew that I needed to get on an exercise program to help me through the rest of pregnancy. This DVD ended up being perfect for me. It's a quick 30 minutes, no worries that I'm doing anything that might hurt baby and I feel a great burst of energy afterward, which is a welcome change from my earlier pregnancy. Would totally recommend to any of my family or friends that are looking for some solid labor prep stretching."
3,It's okay...,"I'm probably going to re-sell the DVD again. It's not great, but just okay. I found a podcast (Mamaste) on iTunes that is much better than the DVD and it's free on iTunes."
3,Okay,"A little slow, only used a few times. Might be good for someone just starting yoga in their pregnancy."
3,Basic Yoga - A Little Too Easy,"The yoga in this DVD is very basic. The teacher isn't too cheesy, which I can appreciate. I have only done the pre-natal workout as I am 8 months pregnant so I can't speak to the post-natal portion. I felt like it was too easy and I get a much better workout at my yoga class each week (granted the class I go to is longer than the DVD). This would be a good DVD if you are just starting yoga and you want a lightweight routine."
4,prenatal yoga,"I have never practiced Yoga before so I wasn't sure what to expect. It certainaly isn't a ""work out"" but it was relaxing, offered good streching and the instruction was clear and easy to follow. I will keep using it for an off day when I just want to strech."
3,Just a good stretch,"This did not feel like a workout to me at all. It felt like a really good stretch. So it would be good for light days or for someone who has no exercise experience, but don't buy it expecting a strenuous workout. The instructor is very soothing and has great cues."
3,Yoga Pregnancy: Pre and Post Natal Workouts,"This is an easy, 30 minute basic yoga workout. Beginners would benefit and it is not too difficult for a woman in her 3rd trimester."
3,Good for the beginner,"I ordered this when I was about 10 weeks pregnant(now 26 weeks) b/c I wanted something slow, relaxing, and easy. It's exactly that. However, the instructor talks throughout the WHOLE video(not so relaxing) and the stretches aren't held for very long. It's an easy routine to remember, so if the constant talking gets on your nerves you can eventually do the whole workout without the dvd."
5,Great video,"Easy to follow, perfect length of time. Helps to get me stretching which is something I never do on my own."
1,Not for people with yoga experience,"I've been practicing yoga for a few years, and when I decided to buy this dvd, I was not expecting a power yoga workout that was going to make me sweat, by any means. I knew this video was going to be ""slow"", and that was fine with me because I was looking for something relaxing and for good stretches. Well, I hate this dvd. It made me feel nothing at all. It is way too easy for anyone with yoga experience and it's boring, but more importantly, it's not even a good stretch, which is what I wanted to get out of it. I literally felt nothing during and after this ""workout"" (aside for frustration), and wish I haven't bought it. Maybe it's good for women who want to start practicing yoga now that they're pregnant, but that's about it. I would not recommend this to anyone with yoga experience."
2,not THAT great,"I am fairly well rounded in yoga and just wanted a dvd to motivate me through my last trimester. This dvd didn't teach me anything new. I feel as though she talks too much, and that (for me) interferes with staying centered in my practice. Also, you could find these poses online and do them.I needed something a bit more centering and challenging. I absolutely LOVE Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1.Hope this helps!"
1,"This is a relaxation video, not a workout","Calling this a workout is a joke. It is very slow paced, with about 10 minutes of stretching, followed by 3 (easy) yoga poses, then 10 more minutes of cool down stretching which is remarkably similar to the warmup stretching sequence. I am 5 months pregnant, was only moderately fit prior to pregnancy, am not a regular yoga practitioner, and this video did not affect my heart rate, breath, or body temp in the slightest. I was far closer to falling asleep than burning calories. That being said, it was quite relaxing, so if you're looking for a pregnant yoga pre-bedtime routine, then this is the one for you. I will not be using this again."
2,Not great,I had given this so many chances and just realized that the instructor talks way too much for me to get into it. :-/
3,exercise,Great stretching tips and moves. Only wish it was a little linger so it felt like more of a workout
2,Not Great,"I bought this in my 3rd trimester and only did it once. I am a big workout DVD fan but this just didn't do it for me. It was boring and I found it to be of poor quality and a little too ""fruity"" for my liking."
5,Very effective video,This DVD is great. I try to do it a few times a week. I am taking a pre-natal yoga class every weekend and was looking for a DVD I could do during the week. This DVD shares many of the same poses and advice as my prenatal yoga class. So glad I got it!
3,nice and relaxing,"I found the prenatal yoga on this video to be very slow and relaxing. Not as challenging as I would have liked, but good for a none stressful workout. For me personally this dvd is not as much of a workout that I was hoping for. The dvd is good for those very new to yoga and working out in general, or to those who are much further along in their pregancy."
5,Great for beginners!,I am currently 24 weeks pregnant and haven't done yoga in a while. The prenatal portion of this video is great for beginners or those that haven't done yoga in a while. It was very relaxing and helped you focus on breathing and the poses helped you focus on the muscles that will be used during delivery. I definitely plan on doing this video several times a week for as long as I can.
3,A bit dull,"I love yoga and was interested in finding something that would work well for pregnancy, so I picked this up. On the plus side, it's only a 30 minute workout and very manageable. On the downside, it's a bit of a boring workout. It will do the job, but I'm not enthusiastic about it."
5,Great for people with low back problems,I recently purchased this workout to increase the flexibility in my low back. I have had low back surgery and unable to perform in the regular yoga classes. This is a great supplement!
3,???,So Im not that big of a fan for Yoga but i thougth i needed the exercise and so I bought this. Ive used it once and didnt finish. It's like i said thought Im not a Yoga fan and i dont like low speed workouts.
2,ok,"To be fair, I'm not a huge yoga fan to begin with. If you feel the same as me, this workout is not going to change your mind. However, I did feel pretty good at the end."
5,way to go sonya,i grew up listening to sonya and her familis music i want her to know i really enjoy her song and wish her the best luck.
5,Love doesn't just hurt... it dislocates,"Y'know, listening to Swans over headphones is like signing up your girlfriend for REAL kickboxing (not TAE-DOH) lessons: your friends think you're nuts, you know it's gonna end up hurting like hell, and yet... you relish the inevitable, you masochist, you. Go ahead... give in."
4,The darkest music you'll ever hear,"If you think bands like Korn and Manson are horrific, you really need to hear Swans (not THE Swans, just Swans). Unlike the bird, Swans were more horrifying than any other band in the 80s. Towards the 90s, they moved into ambient and atmospheric style. You'd never guess that from hearing this album. from the grindcore of ""Half Life"" to the gothic orchestrations of ""Greed"", this is two CDs and over two hours of pure horror. I really can't recommended this for the weak of heart; it's THAT extreme."
4,Festive and spiritual,"The Baluch music is filled with beautiful rhythms capped by the mysteriously transfixing voice of female lead vocalist Rahima. Admittedly, since the Baluch Ensemble's music is an experience involving the whole body (there is an important visual element to this music), the CD cannot prefectly replicate a live concert. Nonetheless, I'd highly recommend it to both music experts and casual listeners who enjoy original, unique, and well-performed music.The music is eastern in the sounds produced by its instruments, but Rahima's voice sounds Andulucian. (I suspect the Muslim link between Spain and Pakistan affects this.) It produces a wonderful juxtaposition performed by people who are the masters of their music."
4,Linux is good,"I am an ""advanced"" computer user. Computer Nerd/Geek in other terms. Linux is usualy more customizable than Windows, if you have the knowledge.Linux is getting easier to use every day."
5,"Great how to, shows that Linux can be fun",This is a great book! It showed me that that everything in Windows is available in Linux and more. I can work on office spreadsheets and listen to my MP3s. I'm going to buy a second copy for my local library.
3,Not Bad but there are better books,This is a good book for instalation and setup.But I feel not enough betail was givin on some topics.The best Book I read for newbies is sam`s teach yourselfunix in 24 hours.It teaches you how to use the shell. That to me is the true power of linux
2,To basic for a prior windows user.,The book went over things that work very similar to the way windows works. I was hoping for a through explination on the install which was not there. The book focuses on how to use the kde desktop (which works alot like windows). I read about half the book when I put it down and just jumped in and tried what worked in windows. Like right clicking on the desktop to custimize it and it brought up a menu with a configure desktop as an option that brought up what I was looking for. I found the jumping in and playing option got me up and running alot quicker than reading the book and following along.I don't think this book would help the prior windows user much. But would be good for a person just starting out with linux without any windows background as it gives basic functons of a few programs usually included with linux.
4,The easiest way yet to switch from Windows!,"The author has a very down-to-earth way of explaining the simplest way of switching to LINUX. I would recommend this book for the person who would like to try LINUX, but maybe feels slightly intimidated. It is very helpful and straightforward without to much command-line usage. Concentrates on how to accomplish things using a GUI interface. Excellent!"
3,Pretty good - not awesome,"This video is OK. It's entertaining for the little ones but I wish it had more ""educational"" aspects to it. For example, instead of just music with videos of animals, it would be awesome if they showed the animal making the animal noise that we all teach our kids. Like the elephant trumpeting, the lion roaring, the monkey chattering, etc. That would help my daughter at least connect the dots between what I tell her when reading books and what she sees in the video. Its hard to find videos like that.That being said, my 14 month old is pretty entertained by it. But she does like her other videos better that have more talking about the animals. Basically I think kids sometimes prefer the educational stuff over just music and video."
2,Baby Genius is NO Baby Einstein,"As a new mother I have a lot of information I must constantly learn...DVDs can be a lifesaver for when I'd like to take a shower, make dinner, do laundry etc.However with the exception of one (I believe it is called ""Baby Genius: Baby Mozart Lullabye"" or something similar) I have been extremely unhappy with all of my Baby Genius products. If you need a DVD for a baby try Baby Einstein, or Baby Signs or something along those lines."
3,Weak program,"Accent reduction needs more insightful advice than what is offered here. I didn't get much out of this program - just some drills that didn't seem to have much of a tie-in to anything of importance. I lost interest quickly and now think that I wasted my money. I highly recommend Sam Chwat's great work for accent reduction of regional American speech, Ann Cook's excellent program for learning the ""music"" of American speech (but watch out for her misguided advice on dropping consonants at the end of words - it will make you sound like a somewhat unpolished and mumbling American), and the living language series."
2,Wasted real estate and not for the car,"The author wastes valuable real estate of cassettes by numbering different sounds for about 10 minutes. During this time the only thing you can do is to listen passively. This part is absolutely useless. Next, the author describes sounds as they are pronounced in different words. But it is exactly the reason why I bought this program in the first place - I cannot hear the difference! - the cassettes are useless without the book. And that is the third reason this program is bad - the author constantly refers to the book and you can't drive and read, if you follow my drift. The program is not totally useless, you may practice in your car by repeating words after the author, but the title ""Learn in your car"" is a misnomer."
2,cheap stuff,"Author has an accent herself , Chinese to be precise. If you want to change your accent to Chinese just get the book! She does not pronounce well some vowels in series (diphthongs and triphthongs), so they are just swallowed. Also she is so focused on pronunciation of separate words that it is hard for her to express the intonation of the whole sentences. She has good English but one can expect more from the teacher."
5,Hard won experience pays off,"eMarketing is a key component of our business and much of our success. Sarah's success comes from helping others, which she does very well! With so much being said about emarketing, often by self-serving authors, Sarah continues to be objective and forthcoming with real-world observations."
2,Not what was pictured.,"I am sure that this gauze will meet my needs, and it is my ""bad"" for not reading the add more closely, but the picture shows individually wrapped packages of fluff gauze by the Kendall companuy with the name Kerlix on it with one opened roll in front of it, and in the body of the ad it states that this is by the Dukal Company. Their ad says that they are ""Kerlix type"" I received 100 pieces as promised, in a box, and those were NOT individually wrapped. They were in a large plastic bag, in bulk in the box. I don't really mind that they are not Kendall, but do not show a picture of one thing and then send another. At least send individually wrapped packages, and DO NOT show another companies photo for a product. It would seem to me that that was meant to deceive the customer. I will keep these and use them, but please change your picture."
3,O.K. but not great,"Starts out really, really good but kind of bogs down after first couple of chapters. Still, the first chapters spell out the problem very well"
1,Confused,"This was a joke, right?I mean, blaming Marxists is so passe. In modern discourse ""Marxists"" may as well be ""Martians."" An absurd, non-existant bogeyman if I ever heard of one. No, today it is not Marxists that threaten to shred the moral fabric of society with their gibberish about ""equality"" and ""justice,"" it's those pesky terrorists!So Dr. Maglio, in order to bring your book up to date, and henceforth thrust it into that elusive realm of relevance, I offer you four simple steps:1. Find & Replace2. Marxists = Evil Muslims3. Fear! Fear! Fear!4. Profit"
5,Invasion Within,I liked the book because it is in line with my values and it also has helped me make a huge decision about my marriage.Good luck Dr. Maglio.
3,Good for Smaller Projects...,"Good for smaller projects. The stickers in this book, though very colorful and historic, are also very small. Averaging about 2"" x 3"" or less. If you are looking for larger stickers of the size they actually used on luggage, this may not be the right fit."
2,Stickers that do not stick,"These look great and would work fine if they could only hold on to the suitcase.I did all I could to prevent it - wore disposable gloves, handled them by edges, cleaned up the suitcase surface even though they were brand new.I then pressed on them so they would stick porperly. THey did. Unitl next morning when I found them almost half off....Should I use super glue now?? naah I don't think it's worth the hassle."
4,Fabulous for a craft project,"This booklet comes with a multitude of goodlooking old style travel/hotel stickers. Each has a white border so remember that for projects. Also, they have almost no stick, so be ready to apply a better paste or glue yourself. i bought them specifically to arrange artfully on the painted black wood frame around a mirro, then I applied decoupage over the entire placement. It made for a beautiful mirror wall hanging for a young person who someday hopes to travel the whole world :)."
5,Andras Rocks,"This is one of the best guidebooks I've ever encountered. Not only was it informative and enlightening, but it was extremely amusing and entertaining."
4,Very informative inside view of a fascinating season.,"An excellent view behind all the press releases and posturing of an F1 team. Matchett gives details of what it's like to live the sport, spending weeks on end away from home, working through the night to prepare the car...and then having to fix it all again when it crashes. If you've ever thought about becoming part of ""the circus,"" this book will give you an idea of what to expect.A big bonus is that Matchett happened to pick the 1994 season to write about, so there is plenty of fascinating information from the team's side about all the accusations and innuendo that arose during Benetton's first championship year."
3,Houdini,We didn't get this in time for a school project as the first one was damaged but Amazon replaced it immediately. It is a good biography and video shows Houdini's life in detail.
1,Won't play on the XBOX 360,"There are no updates to make this play on the XBox 360, really disappointing. I should have checked before I ordered it"
4,"Interesting sampling, cool stuff","I am not a regular fan of this type of music, I just got this CD for free because a record label I intern at had an extra copy. I'm real glad I grabbed it. I can't really say anything intelligent about the music because I'm not too familiar with the genre, but I can say that it's better than most stuff I hear of this type. I really enjoyed the heavy sampling of conspiracy theory and I found it too be entertaining and often humorous. Plus, the last song features samples from King Crimson (!) and Black Sabbath songs, so that right there gives it some merit."
3,This text is excellent for intermediate shotokan karateka.,The photographs of kata and kumite are excellent. The application of kata are also well-illustrated. The major failing of the book is that it relies too heavily on the pictures with little or no explanation. A good intermediate or advanced student will benefit but only with careful analysis. The section on kumite techniques is unique in that many combinations are presented which are not a normal part of JKA karate. I recommend this book to any who are interested in a good technical manual and who are not mentally restricted to karatedo from previous teachings.
2,Needs more description of dynamics,"The pictures are reasonable but the dynamics (steps, directions). This is a good book if you already know the katas. You won't learn a kata from it."
2,Quarks Exist!,"Having enjoyed both physics and philosophy, I thought this volume might give a group of connections and parallels, a new lens. It doesn't work out that way, and I just couldn't get into the book. The analogies were too reaching and the tendency of reductionism in physics clashes with the tendency of expansionism in mysticism. Didn't like the way all Eastern philosophies were lumped together, and didn't like the way early western philosophy was presented.Dealbreaker for me though, was the existence of quarks (experimentally confirmed by particle accelerators) were still questioned in this edition. That felt too much like denying reality for my taste; the idea behind my reading of this book was expanding my concept of the real, not arguing with it.So in the end, I didn't like the book and cannot recommend it."
4,Stimulating food for thought,"I can understand why this enlightening book achieved cult status as it is an excellent exposition of some real correspondences that had probably never before been pointed out. Having known very little on the physics side, it has certainly taught me a lot and I am sure these parallels will become even more obvious with advances in the studey of quantum physics. Tao was a great pleasure to read as the author takes pains to be clear and understandable, and the book is lavishly illustrated with plates and drawings. I fround the section on the I Ching hexagrams of particular interest. Dana Zohar'sThe Quantum Selfis a good choice to read at the same time, whilst ""Tao"" also further stimulated my interest in sacred geometry."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Not Good. This was a real snoozer. I only purchased this book becasue it was referenced in another book I was reading. No truth found in these pages.
5,Eastern mysticism meets Western science,"The Tao of Physics is a fascinating exploration of the parallels between Western Science and Eastern Mysticism. The insights that Fritjof offers does help one understand the similarities among the different philosophical worldviews of the East and theWest. There are many ""gaps"" in Physics that cannot explain the Universe in itself. Fritjof Capra suggests an integration of the two different perspectives to get a better understanding of the universe.This book is very easy to read. This book is a very good starting point if you wish to find the parallels by yourself. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
2,Nothing new,"Capra's physics says virtually nothing about religion or the human condition.Words such as ""soul"", ""spirit"" and ""religion"" don't appear in the index.In the physics sections of the book, religious questions are not addressed.His new physics seems to be no more than an unrelated subjectivism, coinciding with flabby New Age ideas such as creating your own reality.He over-simplifies physics and Eastern thought.His answer is a simplistic ""all is one"", ""go with the flow"" approach.This is re-cycled '60's stuff!I don't see much that is of use in Eastern religions anyway.Their approach, especially Buddhism, is to deny human problems and seek a stae of non-attachment to life.They don't come to grips with living, they say all is illusion,just turn off your mind and deny life.Capra links his ideas with green politics, feminist spirituality and other fashionable trends in a dubious attempt to give his own ideas some credibility."
5,This is a wonderfully profound book.,"The thesis is that quantum mechanics were understood by Eastern Religions (e.g., The sutras of Buhhda, the Upanishads , etc.) 2000 years ago. And that reality is much closer to the Taoist view than the western view. It is extremely profound. Capra explains many basic atomic physics concepts clearly. It does require some discipline to read all 341 pages. It is worth it."
5,The Tao of Physics,I have read and reread this book several times it helps the layman to understand the principles of quantum physics in simple yet adecuate ways.Very goodHilda Pomares
2,"some interesting ideas, but...","Everyone I know in physics, like myself says ""I don't know about the Taoism, but he doesn't have the physics quite right."" Everyone I know from an Eastern Philosophy background says ""I don't know about the physics, but he doesn't have the Taoism quite right."""
4,"Pleasant Transaction, Excellent Condition","A VERY interesting book, I was thrilled to find it at such a good price. The book was shipped the same day I ordered it and arrived within a few days; it was in excellent condition. I'm thrilled with the find."
3,Tough Read,"This is a good comparison of the ""new physics"" and Eastern mysticism, however some of the chapters are hard to read and understand."
1,Do not trust this book,"In the 70s it was an original book.I was amazed to see that today, after the existence of quarks was proven by experiment (at CERN and Fermilab) the so called ""new"" editions still doubt the existence of quarks because they do not fit the grand scheme of the thesis of the book. Better avoid this book. Its not trustable.(The author is a Physics Prof at the Weizmann Institute)"
2,Overrated.,"The subject matter is fine, but _The Tao of Physics_ is dull, repetitive, and superficial. Many of the physicists who developed quantum mechanics had their own highly developed views on metaphysics; it's ironic that so few readers are aware of their writings and that a lightweight book like Capra's is so popular. Read _Quantum Questions_, edited by Ken Wilber, and you'll understand why _The Tao of Physics_ is a weak book."
4,Pretty Interesting.,"This book has had a profound effect on my beliefs-set. Very interesting parallels in this book between science and philosophy have forced me to look at eastern philosophy and thought in new light.The only drawback in this book is that, at times, it delves too deep into quantum physics.At any rate, a book worth reading."
3,Good for the budding young philosophers and physicists.,"Capra gives very good inroductions into the worlds of Eastern mysticism and modern physics. Anyone interested in learning more about these two topics will enjoy this book merely for content. But, Capra tries to draw parallels between the two worlds using very general and obscure arguments. Religion and physics have nothing to do with each other, and in the end Capra proves this, the opposite of which he intended. All in all the general reader will enjoy this, but an educated physicist will either laugh or become too frustrated by Capra's generalities to ever finish the book."
5,Review of The Tao of Physics by Fritjof Capra,"It brings more light about the scientific search for truth of how nature works. This book will stand as a milestone, like a guide to understanding the transformational process from separation to unity that is in progress."
5,The Creator,"If I had read this Book when he wrote it, it would have saved me over nine years of reading and research . I was seeking answers and felt all alone and read and read, when this man had lead the way to an ever increasingly significant change in religious thinking long before I started my lonely search. Poor research on my part. BUT he went ahead before anyone else I know had done a major work of this sort.The best possible book to start in exploring the concepts of Science as the guide to Religionaand Spirituality."
5,Fusing eastern thought with science,"Capra takes a step backwards to get everything into the picture and shows how a selection of eastern schools of thought and modern physics think so much alike. He manages this without shoving religious dogma down your throat or losing you in mathematics. As a physicist, I was sceptical about this book as often modern physics has been taken completely out of its context and misinterpreted. Capra shows a thorough understanding of the quantum mechanical and relativistic principles illustrated in this book. For the non-physicist I would advise reading up some material on introductory relativity and quantum physics beforehand, just as I felt disadvantaged not having a good background in eastern philosophy. This book strengthens my belief that an understanding of the human situation comes not from a single spiritual or intellectual paradigm, but from a unification of the fruits of all human endeavours."
3,Interesting parallels...,"Shows interesting parallels between Taoist philosophy and western science. I've read three different sources in Taoist thought and I have to say that Mr. Capra has done a great job in making this book readable to the average ""joe"". Although I've long given-up my ""eastern philosophy phase"", I would still recommend this book. To put it simply, it's poetry in motion. Whatever your thoughts, I would suggest you read Lao Tzu's TAOISM first, then after reading this book make-up your own mind."
1,I couldn't finish this book.,"I'm an avid reader and tend to finish all books that I've started, be they mediocre, but this was just too much. It severely lacked continuity and substance"
1,A Poor Recording,"This CD was recorded at way too low volume. The CDs in my car play between volume levels 18 and 24; to get the same volume, this one had to play at 40. Then, there were sections that were so quiet that I had to turn the speakers all the way up just to make sure that silence wasn't recorded.When you turn it over it says ""My Fatherland (excerpts)"". This is fine, but it does not deserve the primary title of The Moldau."
5,Truly Terrifying,I first read this book while locked up in 1994. It is by far one of the best horror/mystery stories that I ever read. Scary - There were chapters in this story where I was actually afraid to turn the page. Neither Steven King nor Koontz has ever written a story as intriguing as this. It is re-print at this time. I believe that the re-print is going for $69. I paid under $5 for my copy through Amazon.com. My copy was used. I would have been willing to pay much more for my used copy of this book.
1,Not worth the time or the money,"I recieved this book through a book club that I belong to. I couldn't wait to delve into it after reading the back of the book. Besides, if it happens in the woods it has to be awesome, right? WRONG!!!I oculdn't get past the first eight chapters, I tried several times, just couldn't do it. It was poorly written, moved way too slow, and wasn't enough to keep my interest... keep my interest? It couldn't even get my interest.I love horror, but this one is a dud."
5,The Pines...A must read,"THE PINES by Robert Dunbar, one of the best novels I've ever read,affords its readers a rare opportunity to experience the combination of scary thrills, readability and literary fiction at the same time.This is a book (no matter whether you want to read for fun, frissons, screams or delving into new works) that will utterly astound you. Dunbar has no parallel when it comes to creating characters, scenes, settings, plot and metaphor.Ready to be absorbed?When you step into the world of THE PINES, you will find that you are immersed in an arena that is so vivifying and grounded in our issues and our time that you'll be stunned that Dunbar has created what you could not have possibly imagined even though it seems so real-- and that you cannot let go. And, more terrifying still, that this world he has so meticulously created in the wilderness of the Jersey pines cannot let go of you.This is a must read."
1,"Because of this book, I have decided to become a writer.","If crap like this can get published then I should have no problem. I have read hundreds of books and I'm no expert on literature but I know what I like and this is the worst book I have ever read. It is disjointed, its characters are underdeveloped, and there were parts of this book that I had to keep re-reading because they made no sense. From the beginning, I did not like the characters' banter in the ambulance. I found them to be a flat and humorless bunch. I kept reading though because I love a good horror story and can usually forgive character flaws in a novel of this genre. But nope, it just never got any better and the character flaws began to overpower the story. I wish I could at least say it was a scary story, or even decent but I can't. Sorry. Don't waste your time."
3,A good read,"This book was a good read, but I have to admit it left me feeling a little dirty afterwards. You don't really like anyone, and for me that is very important. You need to want them to live for the horror to work when they die.However, the scenery is, if anything, too detailed, and the attacks come from a source I should have predicted earlier, but couldn't. I enjoyed the reveal."
3,The Pines by Robert Dunbar,"The Pines by Robert Dunbar was an entertaining read, and the first novel I've read by the author.I found it well written, but slow to start and populated by unlikeable characters. It picked up around the half-way mark, and finished well enough. I'll most likely read more by Robert Dunbar."
3,A Decent Product with Some Caveats,"I have this bed in the twin version. I ordered it because of the automatic inflation and the raised platform. The inflation process is amazingly easy and works well. There are three things I don't like:1) The ""dimples"" in the mattress are very deep and can easily be felt. You really need a thick mattress topper.2) The legs of the bed are not perfectly even and had to be leveled by putting cardboard underneath them.3) The mattress ""floats"" in the air so that a flat sheet and blankets cannot be tucked in. I dealt with this by safety-pinning the flat sheet onto the fitted sheet at the bottom of the bed. The blankets placed on top of the secured flat sheet stayed in place."
1,Disappointed in the sturdiness of this bed,"We bought this bed from Frontgate on 12-15-2007. It was a dream come true: attractively packaged, easy to use, and comfortable. We also bought the topper and matching sheet set. Just as I was about to pat myself on the back for a good purchase, I noticed that I had a difficult time rolling the bed back in. We checked it out and noticed that one support had broken on each side. This was the 6th time we had used the bed. The specifications indicated that these were steel supports. IF they are, they are extremely flimsy. Frontgate offered us a gift certificate for a portion of the purchase price, but no exchange. I feel stuck with a broken bed and wonder how to recycle an item that otherwise looks brand new. Caveat Emptor on this item!"
2,Not worth it.,I bought this item from Sam's Club and was very excited to break it out when our dog sitter used it while we were out of town. She said the first two nights were great--but the third day she showed up and the entire mattress had deflated. We filled it back up and it definately has a leak. We are returning this item before the 90 days it up--what a bummer.
3,EZ Bed mattress problem,"I really liked the queen size EZ Bed I bought from Frontgate--easy set-up and very comfortable. Unfortunately, after about six uses (and out of the warranty period) several of the ""dimples"" in the mattress broke apart and resulted in a huge bump right in the middle of the mattress when inflated. This rendered the bed totally unusable. Frontgate would not replace the bed. They requested photos of the problem and sent a gift certificate for only half the price."
5,sensual Deep River Woman,"I tracked this CD from hearing Deep River Woman on the radio one night and trying to figure out if it was Alabama or Lionel Richie. A thrilling song. Through Amazon.com and the review there, I learned it is both. What magnificent harmony -- sends chills -- and such emotion in the lyrics about dedication to your mate. Great song for dancers."
4,Lionel does it again!,"Excellent. It's music like this that puts to shame the dull, uninspiring, and depressing music of the 90's. I did not give this 5 stars because I felt that a couple of songs were a little too off-beat for my tastes. Overall, this was a solid piece of work. I would buy this CD just for the title track- I can't stop listening to it!"
3,Average adult-contemporary album,"Bit of everything on this one: soul (""Don't Stop""), adult-contemporary (""Love Will Conquer All"", ""Dancing On The Ceiling""), country (""Deep River Woman""), reggae even (check out his accent on ""Sela""). Overall, an average, not great white music album. Recommended for anyone who likes music from Ally McBeal."
5,Francis Tucket,this is an awesome book I recommend reading the whole series for a real page tuner that awaits you every page with crisp and vibrant details. I'm a 10 year old and I recommend this to any kids in elementary ages from 6 to 10 because there's some violence and gore.
3,Call Me Francis Tucket,Call Me Francis TucketBy: Gary PaulsenThe book I read was titled Call Me Francis Tucket. The author is Gary Paulsen. This book is a sequel to the story Mr. Tucket where Francis Tucket is captured by a group of Pawnee Indians on the Oregon Trail on his way out west. In this sequel Francis is surviving with a man named Mr. Grimes. Mr. Grimes is a man who rescues Francis from the Pawnees in this story. Mr. Grimes has been with Francis for a long time and teaches Francis lots of survival skills until something comes up and Mr. Grimes has to take care of some business. There are tons of events that happen in this story and it kept me on the edge of my seat. This book made me sad and made me laugh. This was a great book and I encourage anyone who wants to know more about what the west was like and for people who are interested in survival stories.
4,One Great Book!!!,"This is my favorite in all of the Tucket series. You feel as though you are actually riding with Francis! Just the the right mix of action ,adventure ,and comedy.I can't wait to finish this series of books by my favorite author, Gary Paulsen."
1,not worth your money,"i rented this movie from the redbox for $1.00 and im happy i did not pay any more than that. this movie is not funny. this is not a movie with a script. this dvd is filled with clips of mike epps talking to people on street , also clips of him doing stand up at different clubs, and differet skits that are not funny. this dvd is not worth your time, even if your the biggest mike epps fan. i would not recommened this dvd. (sorry mike epps, please come hardeR than this!)"
2,okay,I was kind of disappointed with this CD of Mike Epps. I was expecting to see a 'stand-up' performance not skits.
1,Not funny at ALL!!!!!,I thought Mike was funny. NOT ON THIS ONE! Saw a review and look everywhere for it. When I finally found it on Amazon I was excited for it to arrived. Would like to sell it back!
4,funny :D,"I thought it was very funny. I know some types of comedy aren't for everyone, but I liked it :)"
1,Dont buy this,this is not a stand up comedy dvd its a waste of timei love mike but this time no ....
1,Try Try Again Please Mike,"I've always been a fan of Mike Epps. I love the movies, but I watched most of this DVD on YouTube. There's one sketch in particular were he and a black female are imitating Michele & Barack Obama in the White House that I found totally offensive to our first African American President & First Lady. The skit was full of stereotypes and for Mike to go there, I was disappointed. It's just not funny at all. Save your money. Watch it on YouTube."
1,"""Ain't goin' nowhere!""","I kept waiting for the main point of the book but never found it. There were some interesting historical portions but for the most part this book just did not keep me interested and wanting to read more. It seemed very repetitive, like it was going nowhere."
2,Starts good but then...,"This book was good as a history, but did not hold my attention. I liked the book STIFF much better. The writers sound like they could be fun though."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I read a favorable review of this book so I got it. I havebeen reading obits for a good while and they are a great delight.I thought this book would aid me somehow in this pursuit, butit did not. All it did was to puff up the professional obitwriters, about how interesting they are, unappreciated , etc. I guess I should have gotten a book of actual interesting obits instead. If the author could have cut thebook down to 20 pages, it would have been enough. My adviceto people who are interested in obits,.... is to read obits."
2,Disappointing that the author's politics get in the way.,"It's disappointing that the author's politics get in the way enough to annoy a reader. Example: a firearms owner is described as a ""rightwing lunatic"". (Time Out NY, April 5, 2006.) Certainly, every American is entitled to their opinion...but I'm not going to pay $16 to be subjected to Ms. Johnson's unfortunate politics."
5,a lot of fun with dead people,"Good book. The obits themselves are especially fun to read. I would recommend to anyone who reads the obits in the paper every day in the newspaper, before anything else."
5,You'll Never Think of Obituaries The Same Again,"I have always found obituaries and interesting read. When we got the Sunday paper, I would scan through the obits, read the ages of the deceased and their life achievements. The thought of encapsulating someone's life in 4 to 5 inches of column space seemed like a huge task. Marilyn Johnson's book focuses on the people who do just that, those that write obituaries. She interviews obit writers in both the US and England, selecting ones whose obituaries she has enjoyed reading. It also talks about the different type of obituaries and how the format has changed through time. This is one of those books where I said to myself ""wow, you really CAN write a book on just about any topic""."
5,I don't write reviews.....,but The Dead Beat by Marilyn Johnson has brought me to this. It is a great read ....trust me.
5,David Carter is a pop-up genius,"Haven't found a Carter pop-up book that has not been a hit. Depending on the age of your child, they may not last intact very long.... but I've found them easy to repair as well."
4,Fun for 2-3 year olds,Children love to lift up the hats to see who is under there! Also the rhythm of the words make it fun for the children to listen to the book as its being read to them.
4,an excellent book for intermediate to advanced art student,a well done and inspiring book on illuminating letters. a good read for a small book. the illustrations were beautiful and easy to follow.
2,Useful but has some biased entries.....,"This tome (*large* volume) contains much interesting and useful material but, unfortunately, a very few of its authors have an ideological axe to grind. A publication of this sort should be aimed at objectivity, and not be a forum for certain ""contributors"" to propagate their personal sociological/political agendas.Otherwise, I find this to be a generally worthwhile publication, but do be on your guard. =)"
5,performance--par excellence!,"The unique and fascinating readings of the Beethoven symphonies are what you hear in this collection; it's not saying that it is the best, but I can say, with certainty--one of the most remarkable interpretations out there. Oh, the sound is simply superb--recommended!"
5,Can't Beat the Metropolis Records Compilations!,"I am a die-hard industrial fan, and when it comes to industrial, Metropolis Records knows their stuff! Their compilation albums are hard to match. Metropolis 2003 got me started on industrial. There isn't a song on this cd not worth listening to. The songs are original, inspiring, edgy, beautiful, and so much more. I would encourage anyone to pick a copy of this up, and just give it a try. Outstanding!"
4,Food is my medicine,"My doctor prescribed fava beans for my tremor in June of this year. Since then, I have bought boxes of fava beans. These are the best quality for the best price of any of the ones available and they aren't readily available! I have them on subscription to get the better price and use a package of them every three days or so. I have recommended them to others. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because some of the beans are not completely peeled and I have to laboriously clean them off. Inevitably, there are little pieces of the germ under the ""flap"" of the bean that, for all the world, look like bugs when they're cooked. Otherwise, if you have to eat fava beans on a regular basis (I eat a cup of cooked beans twice a day) you can't go wrong with these."
3,Average performance,"While fully functional, the ""hardy powder-coating"" blistered and peeled off of the ball sections within just a few uses. Still, for the money, a decent performing product."
1,don't shop here.it will cost you,WRONG PRODUCT SHIPPED. DECIDED TO KEEP THE PRODUCT AS IT IS A HUDGE HASSEL TO RETURN. THE CLOSEST UPS STORE IS 60 MILES FROM ME. BUT CAN'T GET A REFUND OF THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE. APROX $60.00 MY TRYS FOR A REFUND GO FOR NAUGHT. SUGGEST YOU SHOP ELSEWHERE.
1,Prayer shawl ministry should be FREE!,"I understand that there is a strong possibility that the contents of this book were taken, without permission, from the prayer shawl ministry website: http://www.shawlministry.com/ The prayer shawl ministry is not meant to be a commercial endeavor, but rather a grace filled ministry to those in need of comfort and solace. Please take a look at the prayer shawl ministry website before you buy this book -- you can get all the information for FREE!"
5,Prayer Shawl Ministry,"Excellent guide to the essence of prayer shawl ministry. The companion books are also excellent. For anyone interested in giving someone ""God's Hug,"" this is a wonderful inspirational book."
5,The book has been very resourceful and inspiring!,Thank you so much I have enjoyed it and will be referring to it a lot in the future! Blessings
4,Motivating Book,"I had alreadey seen this book and wanted my own copy. I don't even knit or crochet, but I was inspired to learn to loom knit and get involved in this ministry!"
4,Not sweet but very good,"I'm prompted to write this review after reading the others. Yes folks, Lansky's topics are crude. Poop figures heavily, as does snot (in fact, that's the topic of my favorite poem in this collection). However, Lansky's poems are both funny and clever. They make my kids laugh out loud (and me too). If your sensibility is to fine to be crude or if you have moral objections to bodily fluids (and I suspect that is the case with the other reviewers) then this isn't for you. But, if you're looking for funny, readable verse that kids will like, this is a great one."
1,A Poor Attempt at Poetry,"I was not impressed by this attempt at children's poetry. This book made me think that an author might consider that writing children's poetry is easy. This book makes it obvious that it's not. Why you would publish a collection of such poorly executed poetry is beyond me. The material looks as if it were written by young children, as opposed to for young children. The illustrations were cute though."
1,"What the heck? No, really, what the heck?","What the heck was the author thinking writing a book this atrocious?What the heck was the publisher thinking?And what the heck was I thinking buying this book for my twin sons after scanning one poem about a dog?At least I can say that I never read any of the ""poop"" poems before purchasing it. What excuse do the other two have?"
3,Time Heals Everything (even memories),"This show's strength was certainly in its music. Its plot was depressing, its required choreography and effects difficult. The music, however, is some of Jerry Herman's finest work. 'Time Heals Everything' is a classic of love and pain. All of the music has a very period feel, appropriate to the setting of the show, somewhat frenetic at times."
2,The plot!,"I've played this game like 5 times all the way through just trying to find out what happens with the Human plot. If you go too fast, it never develops... if you go too slow, you get creamed by the other races! It's so frusterating.Fun to play except for this one little flaw in the human's plot!"
4,Good- almost Great,"I just bought this game about a mounth ago and just now getting it to it. I the beggining there was just so much to learn, but in the end I think it helped the game. Besids being so much to learn i also thought that the unreal in the way of takeing for ever to find stars. If it were more reall you would know the position of the stars, but you wouldn't know what was there. And another good point would be if the story could follow what you where doing, not the other way around. If it would not say ""o no we found anouther dam crystel of our religes beleif that it is reallllllly cooooooooollll, while im trying to stop some other epire from destroying us. all that said this is overall a pretty good game."
3,not too bad,"My biggest complaint is the lack of diplomacy in the game. Your spies are rarely successful. Quality of available spies varies and it's obvious the other races are always better than yours. The other races only seem to know brute force and they're always threatening you until they're about to be conquered by someone else. Alliances are almost impossible to make or if they are willing, they're too weak to be useful. They just want to attack, attack, attack. The only way to win is to kill everyone. It gets old. Messages are tedious once you've played the game a few times......you can't delete them, you can only click on them as they're playing to speed them along."
4,Too tight for my wrist,"The watch is lovely, but the band is too tight for my wrist (6 3/4""). I will be returning it and will look for an adjustable leather band. Timex has always been a good watch for me and I love the Indiglo feature. Just need a larger one."
3,Pretty watch,"This is a nice watch, but the stretch band was not comfortable for me, so I returned it."
4,Better than Old Blue Eyes,"I've known JD for about 25 years, so I'm a little biased. He's always had a terrific voice and incredible range. He makes his songs sound easy. He recently gave me a copy of this CD and I've been playing it in my vehicle. JD takes Sinatra's songs and does his best to sound like Old Blue Eyes, but he falls short. He sounds better! If you like Sinatra's tunes, you'll love what JD Cash does with them."
1,Outdated version.,Item description showed this was version 2.7 which at the time of order was the newest version. The upgrade chip I received was version 2.2 which is not compatible with newer model systems.
2,NOT the Bitwriter...only the chip.,Ordered this and it was only the chip. The picture shows the Bitwriter and the chip and the description says..this is the bitwriter...wrong. this is the chip. lol Returned the product does me no good without the bitwriter.
4,How psychotherapy and science associate.,"André Haynal has produced fundamental books on the history of science. In this books he makes a recent evaluation of the the problemetic relations between science and psychotherapy, focusing on the psychoanalitical context."
3,Skye,"I feel that the character of Skye was not as well developed as the previous characters in this series. It was a light, easy read, and amusing, but I was a bit disappointed. I am a great fan of Linda Lael Miller and was very pleased with the previous 2 books in this series, and am looking forward to the next."
4,Owllady,Linda Lael Miller is a very good writter. This book leaves you wanting to hurry to the next book in this series.
2,Sketchy at best,"The information in this ""book"" is to my knowledge all factual, but does not give much insight into the man. All of this information is available elsewhere on the net... for free! if you want to spend 20 min. searching."
3,Get out the incense and candles.,"Being a casual fan of the goth genre for twenty years, I thought I'd give this album a try. Of course this is no Sisters Of Mercy. Overall, ""As One Aflame Laid Bare By Desire"" is a nice listen. The majority is quite mellow, definitely moody, and for the most part it's rather calming and beautiful. The few flaws are that it can be over-the-top here and there, and the male vocals are.....not the best. I much prefer the tracks with the girl singing, or the ""instrumentals"". To compare, they remind me the most of Dead Can Dance, just not as daring or experimental, or good. I'd say if you think you might like it, you will. I'd call it goth-light."
2,What the hell was I thinking buying this?,"I heard the track ""Given"" on a sampler CD and was intrigued enough to buy this. Not the smartest purchase I've ever made. Can't decide if the artists here want to be musicians or just bad poets and even worse songwriters. The whole is truly LESS than the sum of the parts. It's hard to categorize this ""music"" as something other than Bohemian Goth, whatever the heck that is. Had I heard more of the CD before buying it I certainly would have saved myself [money]. But hey, that doesn't mean YOU won't like it (snicker, snicker)!"
2,Stoppped working,I purchase 3 units and all three stopped working within the first 3 months of purchase target refused to exchange or return and referred me to the manufacter for a replacement. I call to complain and the manufacter said they would send a replacement for 20.00 plus shipping and handling.. Dont buy not worth the money
1,Not for filing,"Dont buy this in place of filing drawers, it does not hold standard size file folders. It will hold regular sized pieces of paper only if you remove them from folders."
3,50% robbed ?,"I would say there are samples of other books, like ""Revolutionary Suicide"", I don't see exactly why, as this book (""Revolutionary Suicide"") isn't out of print...and the fact that you have people like David Hilliard behind this isn't really a good selling point for the true defenders of The Cause. anyways, there are some scoops I would say in this book, and it allows a better understanding of Mr Huey Newton"
1,propoganda,"Newton? Addict, dope pusher, and complicit in murder. Politics? Crap, when he was high and had his guard down he'd remind people that ""Marxism is my hustle."" The BPP is glorfied by white liberal chumps from the 60's and 70's who are too stupid and scared to understand the reality of the BPP. The book, like Newton, is a bunch of BS. BPP was so great? So influential? Yeah? How are all the black folks in Oakland doing nowadays?"
3,Good Looking Shoe,"Looks good, but heel is higher than advertized, and I haven't gotten them 'broken in' yet. The cut-out part for the toe rubs on the big toe, and heel strap isn't tight enough."
3,Informative but Incomplete,"I'm a long time cross country skier working on improving my downhill technique. I found this book to be well written and somewhat useful, but it's only about skiing on modern downhill-centric ""telemark"" skis with little camber and loads of sidecut. The techniques are quite different than those used on classic free-heel skis. If you ski on bog-standard free-heel cross-country skis, the instruction in this book isn't very helpful. The author says that cross country skis are too stiff for making turns, and leaves it at that, nevermind all the cross country skiers who turn just fine. There's a big world of freeheel skiing. This book is great within its limited scope, but doesn't cover all that its title suggests."
3,The basics and that's it.,"This book briefly touches on all areas of telemark skiing, but doesn't cover any of them particularly well. It would be much better if each section were expanded considerably. There is too much focus on beginning parallel techniques which most readers probably have down already."
3,"Good, but not as good as typical Bova.","_Venus_ follows a familiar form; it is easily compared to the Mars (_Mars_ and _Return to Mars_) and Moon (_Moonrise_ and _Moonwar_) series. However, it is both the quickest read and the least interesting of the bunch.I would recommend the above 4 books before reading Venus, and if you like those, I would then recommend Venus. Furthermore, the books are all loosely connected, since they share the same ""universe"" and time. They seem to take place in approximately the order they were written. Venus also has a minor character who I believe was also in _Return to Mars_.However, beyond the throw-away connections, each ""planet"" stands alone. Perhaps in the future there will be a book to tie them all together.[Also note that you must click on ""read more"" to see the _Venus_ review in the above Kirkus Reviews section since it covers multiple books.]"
2,"Scinece OK, Fiction Not",I like Ben Bova's work; just not this time. It may be the characters' fault. There weren't any of them that I'd want to spend time with -- each more selfish and short sighted than the last. Add plot twists that sent more telgraphs than Western Union and it just wasn't a book to ever pick up again. Too bad the flight was so long...
3,"Some original ideas, but a standard SF book otherwise..","Since not that many books have dealt with trips to Venus (unlike the colonalization of Mars), Ben Bova's idea to write about the conditions of Venus & the way to overcome them (while thowing in a few nice messages about rnvironmental conservation) is nice.But other than the destination, the book isn't that different than any other space voyage SF book, and the characters are especially bland & one dimensional."
2,Skip Venus and move on to the next Planet!,"Yes, I know that Ben Bova is a master of Science and usually his books are a treat. But No, Venus is not. I did learn a few things about the hellish planet but couldn't help but wonder if Mr. Bova got bored half way throught the book and ""rushed it out.""I was left with too many questions about the characters and a very disapointing ending. But silly me, I knew a big surprise ending would be worth the effort. Nope! Very predictible."
2,"Boring, predictable Bova cookie-cutter plot","The plot of Venus is very predictable. The Characters are all paper-thin and even the descriptions of Venus and the science of being there is nothing better than what can be found in a book that focuses on planetary astronomy.If you want to read Bova's Tour 0f the Solar System series, then Venus is a required read. If you are looking for Hard SF that will make you think, go read Stephen Baxter, Gregory Benford or Greg Bear. This book will disappoint."
2,Big disappointment,"I loved Ben Bova's ""Mars,"" so I was looking forward to ""Venus."" I was disappointed, to say the least. ""Mars"" was good because it integrated likable, interesting characters into a believable plot, and described both space travel and planetary exploration in engrossing detail that never got boring. ""Venus"" felt like a gyp. Mostly it was just a soap-operaish plot with unlikable characters (even the protagonist wasn't particularly likable) and very little sense of wonder, as there was during ""Mars.""I'm going to read ""Jupiter"" next, and I hope it has more in common with ""Mars"" than with ""Venus."""
4,Venus Envy,"I like this new novel by Ben Bova. It's set in the same ""universe"" as Moonbase and Moonrise. Venus is a fascinating world and Bova captures its mystery and violence quite well. My only misgiving is Bova's preoccupation with murdering parents and envious siblings! Ditto Moonbase. These brutal people are the last kinds of characters we'd want on other worlds. They are amoral and stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Maybe he's too black and white in developing his characters? No matter, Bova has developed a very hard edge although he probably had it all along growing up on the streets of Philadelphia. Still a good book by a very good author."
2,Despicable Characters,"I read the Dueling Machine some 35 years ago (I think I liked it as a teenager), I decided it was time to try Ben Bova again. I read the reviews. Sexist? Well, ok I can live with it like I live with racial slurs I don't like in a Raymond Chandler novel, etc. But what I wasn't expecting was that the novel contains almost no characters that I felt were worth saving. Sure, characters with flaws can make a book more interesting. But here, after reading past halfway, I realized that I wouldn't care much if any or all of the characters died. Actually if all of them died, including the protagonist, it would be fine by me. Hmm......that's not good. I didn't finish the book....maybe I should have. If you think so, read the book. Me? I'm going back to not reading Ben Bova. Two stars because sci-fi ""exploration"" of Venus was fun."
