1,put in the toilet,I have purchased a lot of crossword books and this is the worst. Don't waste your time and money buying it. Try another
3,Save Your Money,Book is very small which makes it hard to hold and fill out crosswords at the same time. Only 42 puzzles-not to many for the price tag.
4,good stuff,"Mastering The Secrets is a great read covering everything from poses to nutrition and lifestyle. Pretty easy and user friendly languaging and helpful pictures to boot. Dougs style has a very natural and invigorating flow which I liken to yoga meets tai-chi. I would highly recommend the book to any level of practicioner! Much like learning from Doug in person, the book has a very knowledgable yet layed back and often humerous style. Enjoy!"
4,loving diet,"Not only are the vinyasas at once fresh and yogically sound, the chapter on nutrition is wonderful. Doug encourages us to move gently into a whole or possibly raw food diet by first starting out with juicing. He emphasizes raw juices and a diet of almost 70% raw foods in a do-able way. How many yoga books have new information in them? They can introduce and inspire us to read the sacred texts, and that's important to us all. But as far as asana and pranayama go, at best, we can discover innovative vinyasas and sequences, and this is what Doug delivers. Plus, he demonstrates them beautifully! Doug has successfully created a whole body system for someone not new to yoga, but possibly new to wholistic health. This is a great addition to my yoga book library."
3,COOL ALBUM BUT TYPICAL,VADER is one of my all time favorite DM bands but unfortunately I did not really get much from this. It is a cool DM album with heavy brutal riffing and blasting drums in various spots but that's what they have always been known for since the early 90's. They are just a POLISH version of CANNIBAL CORPSE - typical and nothing really new or extra-ordinary.I did not expect much from this album nor will I expect more from them for many more albums to come.
2,hardly worth the money..,"Boring riffs and annoying vocals kill this release almost comepletely. The musicianship is generally made up of mid-paced and simple riffs overlaying some of the most annoying DM vocals in the buisness. The vocals would not matter so much if the musicianship was something a little more memorable. For a slightly better display of Vaders musicianshoip, check out the cd 'Revelations'. Only a few tracks on this album save it from being in the 'steer clear' section."
3,"3 1/2 Not bad, but not the same Vader w/o Doc","""The Beast"" is a solid Vader CD, yet it isn't their best effort, and usually Vader delivers 5 star efforts. Its not a terrible CD, but I have such a hard time dealing with the absence of DOC. I understand that there are many bands that have line-up changes are some remain just as solid. But Doc's replacement just isnt the same (Forgive me, I dont have the CD booklet in front of me and I forget his name) ""The Beast"" starts off ripping your head off, but it seems to drag a bit at the end. Please dont get me wrong, its still above average, and a good listen, but once again, its not the best effort, and small part of the band's tightness seemed to die when DOC passed."
3,A good read but..,"I found it really hard to follow his writing style - and also found that most of the book is comprised of emails that he sent out to hundreds of friends and family members to keep them updated. The story is remarkable and Wong is to be commended, but I can't honestly say that I walked away having learned or experienced anything."
5,A Book of Hope & Celebration of Life,"Let's face it, we know the ending when we start. But, once into the book, you are drawn into the world at the NIC unit. You see what is happening as if you were there experiencing it. To see the raw emotion, experience the day to day happenings is to fall in love with the little life that is so fragile at this stage. Then on the other level you see how much love is shared, how everyone is drawn to this family. And yes, it is a family just like any other. I keep going back to the book and reread passages - when after a bath, little Jackson has a breathing problem, you read the ""prayer"" that BD Wong has going through his head. You get so imvolved that you actually feel emotionally exhausted after you put the book down. I so hope for more books by this particular author! Bravo! I am a Foo Follower for sure!"
1,Do Not Buy This Movie,"The Russian mafia should sue these people for bad acting. When the pseudo-Russians are on the screen time passes ever so slowly. Save your money and buy a good movie like Shallow Grave, which covers some of the same themes of greed, friendship, and betrayal. This movie does the impossible and makes Rhys Ifans seem dull. If you like Tara Fitzgerald buy Sirens, but give this sad effort a pass. It is much less than the sum of its parts."
2,Rancid Aluminum,"Didn't like this movie at all, first of all it made no sense. I like Joseph Fiennes, but didn't like him in this movie."
4,Shiipped out of state,I shipped the video to my granddaughter out of state so really don't know anything about it.
1,Disappointed,"I'm so sad. I bought this and had it shipped to my twin granddaughters for Easter. It doesn't play in their DVD player. It just doesn't work, like it had been voided. I'm so disappointed. I've bought so much stuff on this site, but probably won't anymore"
1,A Let Down,"Veggie Tales must have changed owners. I expected more content, spirit & personality, as we experienced in other Veggie Tales videos. The people behind the good videos a couple of years ago must have split up, or sold the company to someone else, or got a board to convince them to water down their message. Don't spend your money on this DVD."
2,A Poor Veggie Tales Movie,"I didn't care for the feel of this movie, and neither did my kids. There was too much violence in it (although mild, my children ages 6, 5 and 3 did not want to watch it again). The angel of Easter past did not display much kindness and had quite the attitude. I was really glad we borrowed it from the library before we wasted any money on it.Yes, it did have the redeeming message of Easter in it, and the end was beautiful. But it wasn't a really enjoyable movie like many Veggie Tales. I wish they would stop acting like they're competing with Disney for entertainment and make more movies that stand on their own merit, like they used to. Sadly disappointed."
5,Veggie Tales,My family loves Veggie Tales..........my grand daughter watches them a lot. She has almost the whole collection and loves them.
5,Great,My daughter loves this. I have it on my Kindle and it occupies her at times. I love the Veggie tales since they teach lessens as well as entertain kids in a positive way
4,Cute,I love veggie tales and so do my kids! We watched this on Easter and really enjoyed it. It was streamed and we didn't have any problems with it!
2,Worst In The 'Tomatoes' Series,"You know a movie is in trouble when its opening credits is the best part. The opening credits of Killer Tomatoes Eat France is very funny, but it's too bad that the rest of the movie is pretty much downhill from there. Things slightly pick up toward the end, when a giant killer tomato appears. Unfortunately, it's too little too late. This is the worst in the Killer Tomatoes series."
5,"The tomatoes ate france, or did they?","I have always enjoyed the silly fun of the ""Killer Tomato"" movies. This last installment (for now?) is very funny and full of satire. I didn't know there were palm trees in France ...The makers of the film continue to produce these beauties with their tongues firmly in their cheeks. John Astin relishes (pardon the pun) his role of Dr. Gangrene.If you loved the other ""Tomato"" movies, you'll really enjoy this one, too."
3,Not as terrible as the 3rd one,"The first two are fantastic. The third one is slightly less fun than filling your underwear with starving badgers. This one doesn't live up to the legend that the first two established, but it is so much better than the third."
3,"""Killer Tomato is A Smash Hit""","I bought this as a joke for my sister.....who is interested in French culture. We have always joked about the Killer Tomatoe Series and It was the perfect ""FUN"" experience for her birthday.Of course the film is campy, silly, weird and amusing....Just what we were looking for in crazy, light, entertainment.."
3,Carrying on the tradition,"Not much one can say about this one other than, it's more of the same nonsence as the others.Only for fans of theTomatoe flicks, which I happen to be. Silly,stupid,and yet funny!A must for all fans."
5,Poetry That Comes Alive,"This book of poetry by Willard Espy, one of the finest writers to come out of Washington, is simply wonderful. His poems stayed with me long after I read them. A must for all interested in the history of Willapa Bay!"
1,Free copies available,"Instructors may obtain a FREE copy of this Solutions Manual from the publisher, Cambridge University Press. Instructors may contact the authors for the Solutions Manual errata, as well as new exercises and solutions."
2,"The book has too much European flair,",but tries pretensiously to be American. The references to American culture are uninteresting and stuck in the '80's. The book is confusing and un-emapthic.
4,Youthful Romanticism,"I liked what this book was trying to do: describe the fleeting euphoria of falling in love when you're young. But there was something wrong with it. The translation maybe? It didn't make sense at times. Some of the most important moments were ruined by the awkward language. A similar book, ""Girl"" by Blake Nelson does many of the same things, but in plain English and with a better grip on the music and culture of contemporary youth."
2,Jack Left & I Should Have Too,"This coming of age tale had promise. But, lost it somewhere in the pages. Alex is sort of the typical kid going through typical kinds of life experiences. Nothing about this book moved me or made me guess. Basically like reading my older brothers journal in junior high school."
1,not interesting - annoying - capitalize on teenage (???) angst,"I've lived in the same city as the one described in the book, i can tell it's the point of view of some uptown snob brat.. He's not connected to anything, but claims the opposite. This guy gets to my nerves. Now, the book. It's a plot to sell a lot (they made a movie out if it too..) becase teenager love sells well..He was followed by others (see: Moccia) but he remains that tortellini, get this girl, i listen to this music, I quote this artist who lived in my town who did smack but I havent guy. He has been a profiquos opinionist (too much)."
1,Baaaaaaaaaaaad bad bad...,"I read this book in italian after a friend of mine told me it was ""beauuuuuutiful""... And I found it just too BAD. It's about preppy people who are trying to act like Trainspotting's protagonists. And they can't do it. I really hated that book. It is the most boring book I've ever read, and keep in mind I'm a teenager myself; but I don't find anything ""mine"" in the world of ""Jack Frusciante e' uscito dal gruppo"", everyone is so fake or wrong... And I'm fascinated by the number of people who thinks it is a really good book. Read Irvine Welsh, it's much more better and it expresses the anger and the pain of living in today's world in a more realistic way. Much more realistic. I just don't like to read the problems of a teenager who thinks he's the centre of the world and thinks he has serious problem when they are just stupid. :)"
1,"Whatever you do, don't buy this.","The Norton program is, as stated above, horrible. It trashed my hard drive. Their tech support is awful. Whatever you do, stay away."
1,Support is a disaster!,"I spent all day trying to get an actual human on the phone after going through the huge maze of options on their automated telephone line. It took literally hours of being on hold trying again and again to get the right combination of options on their list. If you ever need customer support from these people plane to take a day off of work to sit on the phone being frustrated and aggravated and wishing you never bought their junk. They obviously don't care one bit about their customers, once they have your money their attitude is an obvious ""screw you""! Stay way from this poorly run company, stay FAR away!"
1,Don't Buy this Product!!!,"I purchased this product as part of a sales promotion along with TaxCut, thinking I was getting a good deal. Was I ever wrong! Within a day of putting this product on my computer, my computer crashed and had to be reformatted. The problem was it fought with previous versions of anti-virus programs (even though I thought I had completely removed these programs from my computer, remnants of them remained.) According to tech people I know in a major corporation, this happens often. In our department, in the last week, 4 other people also experienced this problem. Don't buy this product!"
2,"Huge resource hog, many viruses unable to delete","I have a 2.4Ghz, 512ram computer with Windows XP. Once I installed Norton, everything on my computer was extremely sluggish. Once I uninstalled it, everything was normal again. I had kept it installed for some time though and AutoProtect was effective at detecting and blocking viruses or potential viruses from entering the computer. That's the only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. I used LiveUpdate routinely and still, many viruses Norton could not delete or fix. Stay away from this program."
1,Cannot uninstall,"I installed the trial version. After noticing that it severely impacted performance, I tried to remove it. The program does not appear in the Control Panel/ Add Remove Programs list, so it cannot be uninstalled using the normal facility. I sent an email to Symantec support, but so far I have not received a reply. I would hate to have to clean this thing out manually.Skip this program. There are definite problems here."
1,Stay Away from Symantec 2004 products,"Let me join the chorus. After years of being a satisfied Symantec customer I am thoroughly disgusted by this ""upgrade"". It will not install on a brand new HP running XP Home. The help is useless and confusing, the most likely result is trashing other applications that previously ran. After several remove and install attempts I am left without any antivirus protection since the pre-installed NAV that ran before the ""upgrade"" no longer runs. This product should be pulled off the shelves until it is safe to use."
1,beware of false claims from this company,"The antivirus protection this product offers seems to be merely adequate. It is a resource hog and will slow you down big time unless you have a fast system with broadband.This firm did not honor their advertised re-bait for my upgrade. I sent them everything requested, and they sent me back a card saying I forgot the UPC. This is false. I am meticulous about these re-baits. Furthermore, I was ignored by their customer service. Amazon censored an earlier review of mine. Just make sure you photocopy everything. I think they count on rejecting a percent of the claims to pad their profits. I for one will look to TrendMicro or McAfee next time around. Very disappointing experience."
1,I BOUGHT IT AND WAS SORRY,I purchased the online upgrade of NAV 2004. It asked me to delete the prior version. I did and now I have nothing. I can not download the new version. I have nothing to show for my $30.00. Customer support is another $30.00. I am sorry that I wasted my time and money on Norton Anti Virus 2004
1,Awful Software,"I purchased Norton AntiVirus 2004 and attempted to install the program on my PC and I got error message after error message. I finally got to the ""knowledge base"" and was informed that the reason it would not work on my system was because I have a Cyrix processor and there was no solution to the problem. Now I have to send it back and wait 8 weeks for a refund simply because it doesn't like my processor, what kind of crap is that?I had NAV 2001 and loved it, but they stopped having the subscriptions for it. I've had enough of Symantec all together, I am never buying another product from them again."
2,Product Activation Sinks NAV2004,"New in 2004 for NAV: A Microsoft-like Product activation scheme.The NAV CD informs that you have 15 days to 'activate' the software with Symantec or it will stop working. Lose your docs and no more product on re-install.The Anti-virus remains top, but there are many others 99% as good.This is an unwelcome feature for me and I will be buying another solution next year."
1,Do Not Even Try,"Do not even try to use this product. I had many problems trying to get it to work. I followed all recomendations on their website. It still did not work correctly so instead of calling a 900 number and paying per minute to have them fix their problems I called my credit card company to reverse the recent charge to buy the software.If a company wants to automate their processes so much that they no longer give one the option to talk to a human being without paying for it, they better $%^&$#^ well sell products that work well.DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE AND DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS!"
1,Beware!,"I still haven't been able to load the software. I meet all the hardware requirements, but the setup program will not launch at all. Not even an error message. Just the splash screen that lets you browse, etc. Click on install, and nothing.Best of all, there is no way to get answers from symantec without paying more @#$%&* money! Unless you are lucky enough to find your problem in their ""knowledge base.""You might be able to figure it out on your own if you are computer literate enough, but I am not that fortunate."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"This is the biggest lie in antivirus software. This program itself is a virus. Stay away from this piece of junk. Norton will only take your money,ruin your system, and laugh all the way to the bank."
1,Apparently the Virus has eaten their support team,"This is one time that the big brand name purchase is a major mistake! After purchasing this product on line and downloading it, I thought I would have protection with the updates, only to find out that when I changed my ISP, Norton Antivirus live updates no longer worked. After 11 e-mails most of which suggested the same failed proceedures, I have given up and will Purchase McAfee. I have McAfee on 4 units at work and they work fine. One of the benifits of spending money on software is the support that goes with it, obviousy Norton misses this point. This is one product that should be avoided."
2,"Buggy, Buggy, sluggish","It will make your overall computer speed look like a snail. You will have to endure an endless booting timespan. There are so many issues and known problems in their library it's not even funny. And you come to think there was a time in which this software was considered actually good. Trust me, there are way better antivirus solutions in the world, too bad they don't have the same fame. Stay away from it, I beg you."
4,Worth Owning,"Despite the numerous bad reviews seen here on Amazon.com, I just upgraded from Norton Antivirus 2003 to 2004. I was expecting the worst case scenario: my computer gets bogged down with a memory hog of a program. I have no idea what the bad reviews are for. It runs just fine on my PC, and seems to even run a bit FASTER than last year's version. It makes me wonder what OS and hardware they're running in their PCs.(...)The software works exactly the same as previous versions: it scans for viruses, installs, scans again, and then runs weekly to keep your PC virus free. It also scans incoming/outgoing e-mails as well as incoming files. In this day and age of viruses being in every other e-mail, you really need a product to take care of it for you, so I recommend picking up Norton Antivirus 2004."
1,Warning: subscription renewal flawed,"My 2002 version of this program recently told me my subscription for virus definition updates needed to be renewed. So after paying online for the renewal (which has worked twice before), I was given a key number that doesn't work. I tried to find tech support for this issue online but it turns out Symantec doesn't support the 2002 version (er, except for charging me for an unusable subscription renewal). And trying to get through to their billing section produces ""all circuits are busy"" message. So I guess I'll have to try disputing my credit card charge to see if I can get my renewal fee back from Symantec."
1,"Slow Down your system, if you want to.","This has been the ""industry standard"" for anti-virus products. I'm not sure why. It slows down the computer so much, that you think you need a new machine. What you need is another ant-virus product (like Avast). The constant updates are extremely sluggish in being implemented. And what it does to the boot-up time is terrible. This is a dog. Save yourself a lot of frustration, avoid it."
1,Norton AV 2003 (with NSW) was a disaster !!,Norton Anti virus 2003 was a terrible product with lousy support. Anybody can post FAQ's on their web site. What matters to people is speaking to a live person that's not going to charge you when you just made your purchase.These folks just don't get it ! So why buy the 2004 product !
3,This software is...,"When I try to scan computer(2.0 GHz)... it takes about 40mintutes to 1 hour to complete full scan.. and I can't do anything while scaning because computer starts crawling as soon as scaning starts..Also, this software doesn't remove most of spywares.. I would recommend Spysweeper for spywares... Norton anti-virus does detect spywares but doesn't usually remove it..I don't like this software.. but.. well... this one is the best one out of all other ones....."
1,Problems,I've had serious problems with Norton products and customer service is of little assistance.
3,Not for all computers,"Norton continually puts out a great product, but the problems begin when the product begins taking over your computer."
1,download problems,I was actually downloading a renewal it took forever 3 or more hours my computer crashed and a large no of spyware programs were included i ended up removing the norton from my system this was original software and installing a different software so not only did i lose the original software but also my money for the upgrade i am trying to recoup the cost of the download thru the credit card co what a disappointment
2,It worked OK till I tried to uninstall it,"I got an E-machines computer with Norton Antivirus 2003 installed and a free trial period. I was looking for new virus protection but when I read the horror stories on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to go with another product. When I uninstalled NAV 2003, all appeared to go OK with the process but the network would not function afterwards. After two days of playing around, I managed to figure out that NAV had killed Windows XP DHCP process which assigns an address to a machine when the system boots. I happened to run across comments from someone else with a fix. Needless to say, I'm more convinced than ever never to install NAV again. Hope I have a better experience with something else!"
3,Has anyone else ever noticed...,"...that all the five-star reviews to date have the exact same writing style, and are written in the exact same way a corporate press release would be written? Hmm."
1,Norton 2004 is EVIL,I suggest everyone to sue Norton 2004 for what they did to their PC's.My friend is gonna sue Norton 2004 big time for what Norton 2004 did to his PC. he had to reformat his whole system and lost his work and time. he is very anger at Norton.Im so glad I never touch Norton 2004.Im giving this very bad review....do not ever upgrade to Norton 2004.
1,This is *the* virus,"First of all you can only install one copy of this bloated program on one PC, and they keep bugging you about updates and otehr subscriptions. Then, it doesn't stop the latest viruses, plus it wreaks havoc on your system. I think this is the biggest virus of all time. Symantec is the most shameless company in teh world. I feel sorry for the legendary Norton name."
2,Spyware Detection Doesn't Work!!!,"I purchased the Nav2004 edition so I could gain the benefit of having background spyware detection.So after installing, rebooting.. I thought I'd give it a test and download some known Gain spyware such as Precision Time and Data Manager.Nav2003 let me do this without any warning!!.. also when I scanned my system, it still didn't notify me of this..After waiting for over 1/2 hour on their support line.. I gave up and requested a refund..Very disapointing.. as I had hoped that I would have a good solution against spyware... the bane of the internet...So if you have 2003, stick with it.. the new version isn't much better.."
3,Not worth the trouble.,"This software is junk. Sure it will catch your viruses. So what? There are DOZENS of better programs out there that will do the same.Fortunately I did not have installation troubles...butNorton 2004 slowed down my pc like hell. It takes an extra 45 or so seconds to load at boot..and this is on a fairly current 1.8Ghz 512mb RAM P-4 machine.To give you an example of how much of a resource hog it is...if youre a gamer, play the game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and watch in amazement as your FPS rises from 50 average to 76 average when you turn off the CCAPP.EXE file ( a norton 2004 file).Summary:Not worth your money. AVOID."
1,Norton Antivirus 2004,"Symantec Corp is a vindictive company! I let my Norton Antivirus subscription expire and the software proceeded to block my access to web pages with an error message such as ""user domain not recognized"". Deleting the software from my computer was no easy task either since the program requires a product ID code to uninstall it!! Since the software was preloaded when I bought my computer, I had no CD and therefore no product code. It seemed the only solution was to renew my subscription. The solution to uninstall was found on a ""geek"" site. I have now purchased McAfee Internet Security Suite 2006. Stay away from any Symantec product."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON!!!!,You can get the same product directly from Symantec and it will include 1 year's live update subscription. I purchased this product for the full price and there is no way I can activate it without having to pay for another 1 year live update subscription which should have been part of the product!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY OR INSTALL NORTON ANTI VIRUS 2004,"I bought a copy of Norton Antivirus 2004 and proceeded to install it on my Athlon based PC running Windows 2000 Pro (Service Pack 4)When I went to install the Norton Firewall that came bundled with it, my CD drive would not recognise the media in the drive. It gave an error D:\ is not accessible - incorrect function.I then uninstalled the product and the CD Drive now works fine again. Symantec technical support charge 29 Euros to speak to you about each technical problem.So their software screws your machine up then they want to charge you for sorting it out. Most would call that corrupt, possibly even illegal.I tried installing Norton Firewall after this (having uninstalled Anitvirus 2004) and it had the same affect on the CD drive.##############PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT################"
1,Pray you don't need support,"All I can say is, pray you don't ever need to use Symantec support. I bought this program and installed it, then decided to upgrade my operating system from Windows 98 to XP. When I tried to reinstall the Norton product, it assumed that the software was a pirated copy and would not let me. Ok, I thought...reasonable...I'll just get on their website and see what I need to do to reinstall my legal copy. Good luck. A maze of questions with no good answers on their website, and support email addresses where you submit problems and NEVER get a response. I guess I could spend $30 for their support line where I can talk to a human, but that does not make much sense for a product that I could buy all over again for about that same price. Dreadful experience."
1,Norton AntiVirus 2004,"The service is terrible, they will not help you at all.It will not delete the viruses, it will not quarantine, it will not fix. I am very upset with this whole thing. Thank goodness for rebates at least I didn't lose all my money."
1,sucked in,product started to work great like other versions but soon started to go haywire. tech support was no help as each step of the repair lead to another problem. load after reload failed to cure what ails it. stick with the older versions this one is worse than junk. other virus programs picked up viruses not detected. they are fully aware of the problem but continue to sell the product even though they know it will fail shortly after 60 days
1,Wish I wouldn't have upgraded,"Have had the same problems that everyones else had.My computer was so slow after installing Norton 2004.I want my money back.It took over 20 seconds to open my browser.Other programs wouldn't open.Thats too bad I had Norton 2002 that came with my computer and worked great.now I have Mcafee Virus Scan, took under 2 seconds to open my browser, haven't had a problem with other programs opening either.Oh well you win some and loose some, just wish I could get my money back though.But I doubt I will."
1,NAV 2004 is a dog,This version slows down everything. Even the hard drive scans are slow. Avoid this version!
1,Anti--virus software that is worse than a virus.,"This awful program caused a fatal crash on my Windows 98 OS and I've had to reformat my hard disk! Thanks a lot, Symantec.Honestly, a virus itself could hardly have caused much more damage.Luckily, I keep back-ups of important files and the PC running 98 is no longer my main system. However, I am now left totally unprotected on this system and will probably have to reformat the disk again or mess around in the registry to get it off my system, as it won't uninstall properly.This is licenced theft and vandalism."
1,Serious questions about Norton 2004,"from what i've read, and what i've heard from friends, nav 2004 only crashes on windows xp, and old comps with windows 98 are untouched by crashes, but still plagued by slowness. and i do not recommend McAfee unless they've rewritten everything since 7.0, cuz that didnt even find one of the 4 worms on my computer. i suggest norton nav 2003, or avg free."
1,Don't buy this product,"Norton Antivirus 2004 should never have been released. You may not be able to activate the license...and once activated it may not stay activated (and Symantec can't fix it). It also significantly slows your web browsing and email, and may make your new system seem like the one you had 5 years ago. And don't even think about doing something else while scanning your disks...it's a CPU-hog.I've used past versions and they worked great (especially the enterprise version of Antivirus)...skip this one."
2,You do have options...,Buy an inexpensive broadband router such as the D-Link DI-604 (this is your firewall) and a copy of PC-cillin from Trend Micro (this is your virus software) and you're good to go.
1,Overrated,"Had Norton AV about a year..it's terrible. Has never caught a virus in advance, despite updates every three days. Takes over your system, nags you to death, and serves no purpose, assuming you don't open executable email attachments from strangers. What prompted me to write this negative review is a ""feature"" where Norton reboots your computer after an update..with no way to cancel after you have agreed to the update. I hit cancel, and the machine rebooted anyway....ugh. get a clue, norton.Poorly designed, poorly engineered, and of little use."
1,Worst antivirus system I've ever used,"I bought this on Friday 9th January and demanded and got a refund the next day (not from Amazon, I might add...but I am posting this review to give a ""heads up"" to people). The Email Scanning didn't work and gave me an error message that Symantec had no info on their site about, and the AutoScan option kept resetting to Off every time I restarted my PC. There was a note at Symantec stating this was a known problem and they posted a ""fix"" for it which I tried a few times to no avail. The direct customer service was less than helpful. They told me immediately that they had to call me back due to a long phone queue and then didn't ring me. When I called again, I found the customer support office was closed.I won't be purchasing anything from Nortons again and have since chosen another company for my PC protection needs."
1,NAV 2004 problems,"After several months of not being able to renew my 2002 Professional Edition NAV subscrition, I bit the bullet and purchased a new 2004 Norton Anti Virus. It initially installed correctly (apparently) but after a week or son I noticed it wasn't performing automatic scans, so I ran one manually. It identified some files that needed to be deleted which I did. Since then the whole system has been acting up. I tried several times to uninstall and re-install NAV 2004 with no luck. With info from the Symantec site (they have been no help at all and are obviously still denying there is a problem), I have tried everything. I have even now returnred NAV 2004 and purchased NAV 2003. This will also not install because of changes to files that NAV 2004 caused. I have serached and deleted all the files I can that were associated with NAV 2004, but still no luck. I recommend using other products."
1,Not Impressed,Like most people I like to have the latest and greatest. I went out and bought Norton Antivirus 2004 and had some problems installing it. Once installed it was hogging alot of system resources. My computer slowed down drastically and my uploads & downloads were slowed down. It seems to be too much in controll of my computer. I tried it on another PC to make sure and same results. I went back to 2003 after having to delete some registry settings as uninstall does not clean up very well. I will never buy a Antivirus product from Norton again and McAfee is looking good right now. Unfortunately I cannot get my money back.
1,"Too bulky, fewer updates than others..Not worth the price",Norton has made good products for many years. Her old Dos Utilities were second to none. I rescued many a disks with Norton Utilities and restored systems with Ghost.Live update is aweful. One thing thats troubling is updates seem a bit late. MyDoom response was far too slow. The nice GUI and buttons and features many are just not needed and more for user entertainment. I guess really novice PC users like it but really it does take a good amount of system resources vs some other solutions. I dont care for McAfee much either. One I found that works well is F-Secure Inc. They dont sell boxes in the stores but its a bit less bulky and they update really often. That lil Finnish company has been first on many of them. They have an auto updates through backweb. Its pretty nice..Norton needs to get back to basics and stop trying to design its Av software like its a playstation game. My 2 cents.. But Norton Ghost is still greatness!-Nate
1,Horrible,I work in a small office and loaded Norton Antivirus 2004 on our four computers. It SERIOUSLY affected the performance of every one of our machines. My PC was nearly unusable so I ended up having to remove Norton. My computer froze in the middle of this process and we ended up having to get a computer expert in to fix everything.I have been using Norton for five years and never experienced any problems at all until this 2004 release. DO NOT BUY IT!
1,Norton A/V 2004,"Most disappointed with this particular version. Have used Norton A/V for 5 years with few problems. Was unable to complete installation of Norton A/V in that I could never get the windows page which would allow one to install the activation code. Had 3 separate telephone calls in the course of 3 days with Symantec Priority Care Support (Ticket # 1637215), each tech advised that I had to re-enter a ""target code"" into the properties code; this coding was a fairly long string of characters and I requested and each tech agreed to send an email with the code string within which would allow a copy and paste. Was assured that the email would be sent within 20 minutes. After waiting 5 days, decided it was time stop wasting time and accept the fact that my money was poorly spent. Now a proud owner of McAfee Virus Scan Pro."
1,really poor product,i am really sorry i did not read the reviews before buying this product. i have been a norton user for a long time but this product has really turned me off. i am running windows xp professional and this product only runs half the time. most times it crashes on bootup and has caused problems with other programs. sometimes the crash also seems to screw up my video memory. a trip to the support web site is no help if you can get it to respond at all. last week it decided i was not registered and then refused to run (anyone have a lawyer handy?). a call (the only way you can do it) turned up product support is closed on the weekend. looks like they spent all their effort trying to copy protect this product rather than making one that works. do not waste your money. if you have norton 2003 stick with it or try something else.
2,Endless Activation,"After installation, I activate my product through internet and the product shows it is activated. However, the product always show it is not activated after reboot and I have to activate it again and again."
1,Save your money,"I spent the better part of a day trying to get this program to work, without success. There was a ""setup error"" that suggested I go to the Tech Support site. I spent several hours following the links and instructions, without success. This included about fifteen to twenty reconfigurations, computer shutdowns, uninstalls, reinstalls and other instruction followings. Automated website troubleshooting (which did not work) is free. To speak live to someone about your new product, you have to pay a fee of $29.95 per encounter! I had NAV 2003 previously, and had no problems with that older version."
1,Piece of Junk,"Absolutely do not buy this product. First, though you KNOW it IS be compatible with your machine it decides to do a system ""check"" to make sure you really are compatible at install time. If it doesn't like you or your machine, it won't install. I can't install it; so I tried to Customer Service to help me get it to install. After almost an hour on the phone trying to get in contact with customer service (which they wanted me to pay for--they should pay for my cell phone bill). They told me in three words or less that this product won't work on my machine. (This was after they spent ten minutes of my time collecting information--after the hour wait on the phone and being hung up on.) Obviously unless you have the perfect PC, you can't have this product and they won't help you--they don't care."
4,Silly Upgrade If You're Happy with NAV 2003,"Norton's AntiVirus 2004 is basically the same thing as 2003 with only a couple of new features, which, in my opinion, are not even worth paying for an upgrade. It's just a 'touched-up' version of 2003. I was hoping for a lot of new features in this one, but they just aren't here. Yes, there is an expanded threat detection and a more comprehensive messenger scanner, but that's it. If you are happy with 2003, I would recommend skipping this version this year and buy next year's version. There is not enough about this product that warrants an upgrade. I gave this 4-stars because it does work well, in my opinion, but I am very disappointed with 'new features'. I almost wished I would have stayed with 2003 another year."
1,Wouldn't work even after a reformat,"I worked on a friend's computer who upgraded from Norton 2003 to 2004 because Norton sent her an email saying her subscription was expiring and 2003 wasn't being supported. She bought Norton 2004 for her Win98se computer and installed it but it would not take her serial #. She uninstalled and reinstalled. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling also. The error was 3030,26. I looked it up on Norton and it's a known issue that they haven't fixed yet. Some people who have First Aid or Help Spot can solve this problem by removing it, but it wasn't on her computer. I reformatted her computer with Win98se (OS only, not a system restore cd with all the junk) and still couldn't install Norton. She called and got her money back. We use Norton Corporate 7.6 at work and have had no problems, but I would not recommend the Norton home edition. Get Grisoft's AVG instead, I've never had problems with it."
1,Norton Delivers Corrupt Files!,"By many accounts, this is the most highly rated anti-virus software out there. I bought it as an act of good faith, but when I installed it, the files were corrupt. I can't return it, because I've broken the seal. Norton, freely admitting that the files are frequently corrupt on even new copies of its software, declares that it is not its problem, but mine. Forty dollars later, I have never been able to run the real-time update feature. Not once. Now I have McAffee. It runs great - right out of the box. Just to be clear, I don't recommend this product."
1,Horrible...and I'm ususally a big fan.,"I was forced to buy the newest version (2004) when they stopped supporting the version I had. Immediatly after installing, my machine slowed to a crawl, and my printer stopped working. I tried to get help, but there is nowhere to get it unless you pay. There's not even a place to complain about that.So, I removed the software and my problems vanished.Quite a scam: create a product that doesn't work then make your money off support.Now Nortons has my money and I'm left with no updated protection."
1,Subscription hassles,I just tried to renew my subscription to Norton Antivirus 2003... what a major ordeal. They send you a subscription key code with a huge document on how to correctly type it in. Doesn't go thru at all. I worked their tech support several times to no avail. Very frustrating. I ended up eating the cost of 1 year subscription and bought McAfee instead. Much better.
1,Can't work; won't work,"As a product, Norton Antivirus makes a great coffee table coaster because that's all it's good for. NAV let a virus eat my laptop. To Norton's credit, the remedy instructions were clear, concise and easy to follow; unfortunately, they just didn't work. Several months of work lost and untold cost was the price. I religiously kept it up to date, scanned every night, scanned all email and attachments and Norton still failed. If you live and work through the internet like I do, put this product back on the shelf and reach for the red box.Thanks for nothing Norton!"
1,Product Activation Does Not Work,"I upgraded from 2003 version - the product activation keeps resetting itself, even though it has been activated already! It is really annoying to keep redoing the activation - I am going back to the 2003 version."
1,Product Activation is buggy - reinstall OS and NAV breaks,"If you ever need to reinstall your operating system, such as when you upgrade or replace a hard drive, Norton Anti-Virus 2004 activation will think you are pirating the software (since you have already activated it once before). LiveUpdate then quits working. I've been working with Symantec Tech Support for weeks (with no virus updates in the meantime), and they have been slow and no help. Best resort is to repurchase the software (or go with McAfee instead)."
1,Disasterous Upgrade,"After having spent over 4 hours trying to get this damn upgrade to install, I gave up. I can't even boot to a ""Last Good Configuration"" in XP because Symantec has taken over.Tried just about all their dead-end online fixes.Over the years I have weened myself from the other all-too-obtrusive Symantec products. I still liked AntiVirus till this upgrade.NO MORE SYMANTEC!!Plus, I have to PAY if I want to get LIVE support! Their online support is useless!Stay away from Norton Products. Look to the many other equal if not superior options!Now I need to find out how to get all their garbage out of my ""previously perfectly"" running system.Fred"
1,Install Bugs after 98 to XP upgrade,"Bought this version prior to 98 to XP upgrade, as NAV 2000would not be compatable. Installed under 98, seemed fine.After XP upgrade, Norton reported license problem, asked meto uninstall. Uninstall had errors, re-install won't work.NAV 2003 won't install because of traces of 2004.Not recommended if you are planning to get it to ""get ready""for XP upgrade."
5,Engendering Powerful Impressions,"Phyllis Davis guides her reader through an endless array of business settings -- from exchanging business cards to global travel -- and spells out proper etiquette for each situation. Interwoven with her clear, concise advice are dozens of thought-provoking case studies that reinforce her message. The result is an invaluable, easy-to-read resource that I'm recommending to many of my clients.E2 goes far beyond mere rules of polite behavior. It focuses on personal success. It shows how etiquette engenders powerful impressions, sustained credibility, and lasting influence. Ms. Davis is concerned with helping readers create impact everywhere in their business lives, from shaking hands to conducting effective meetings to climbing the corporate ladder. This is a book to be read more than once. In fact, it will stay on my shelf as a ready reference for years to come."
3,Unusual,"This one takes 20 minutes to give an overview of the Bolsheviks and Stalin's rise to power before we even get to the Germans. This one kind of wanders along although it does cover what one needs to know. There is also quite a bit of good footage, better than these documentaries often have.Chekist"
2,Terrible narration,"I was hoping for an interesting and professionally-done documentary of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. While this episode attempts to do that and be that, it is greatly diminished by very poor narration. The narrator constantly mispronounces words (evidently his vocabulary is more limited than most 8th graders) and has a dull, wooden narration style that detracts hugely from what could have been an interesting documentary.Go with The World At War and pass this one by. RJB."
5,Well Done,"Eclectic presentation of information, carefully produced photos, and lots of help to make this not just another cook book."
4,A book to dream about.,"I'm not a fan of Moby's music, but I am a fan of tea and vegetarian food. Even if this book sometimes looks like a huge advertisement leaflet for teany, it also has really useful information and recipes that may or may not involve tea, but that are really good. When I read the one for Pan Bagna, I actually dreamt I was eating Pan Bagna that night! That's how yummy everything is! And I've already bought online a large amount of teas that come in the book. Can't wait to get them and do drink recipes with them, like lavender lemonade. Oh the luxury! If you are lucky enough to live in New York City, go pay teany a visit."
3,"An interesting look at tea, but it's not my cuppa either.","This was a book that I really wanted to like, but I found the entire premise and content a little too 'precious' for my tastes. As a devoted tea drinker, I was hoping to find some new ideas for what to serve up to go with my afternoon break -- instead, while some of the stories and touches of humor are funny, the ingredients were just a bit too odd for me to contemplate. Too, the book gets overly cute in spots, and while I do admire the author's stand on vegantarism, his self-effacing manner really begins to grate after about the fifth time that he mentions that he's trying not to be self-promoting. Hm-hmmm -- and what about that big sticker on the cover informing me of the latest cd release? It's nice for a once through, but I won't be adding it to my pernament collection."
1,I survived Y2K!,"Who didn't know this book was a joke when it came out? I never bought it before Y2K, but have it now as a commemorative peice of evidence to prove how wacky most people are.The idea that all our toasters and refridgerators would cease to opperate at midnight on Jan 1st 2000, is something I could never understand how people would fall for. How would your appliances know what year, day or time it was??The cover of this book makes it great for framing and hanging in your Library, or just having the book out on a coffee table is great for endless laughs.Who would ever buy a book from this author ever again after he lost all his credibility with this book?The value in this book is not from reading it, but for display purposes only."
1,Not Exactly.,"In a way, it's worth reading, if only as an example of a really horrendous prediction.Y2K came and went, nothing much happened, and our infrastructure didn't get fouled up any more than usual.Which is what a lot of us predicted all along."
1,"FUD, BS","This is a book that likes to seed ""Fear Uncertainty and Doubt"". The author is not a computer specialist, programmer, scientist or information management expert. His knowledge of the industry is at best questionable. Read his bio and see for yourself. He is involved in Y2K consulting. He does profit from other's fear of the Y2K. Spend your time and money elsewhere."
1,Thoroughly researched,"NOT!This book was full of half-truths, outdated information (even when first published) and scare tactics. He obviously tried to use the uncertainty of y2k for his own financial gain. Do yourself a favor and avoid books by the doom & gloom camp. They'll be back with another catastrophe (e.g. asteroid, aliens, disease, etc.) pushing their books again. Don't bite their bait."
2,Planning for Paranoia & Getting Peace,This book paints a doom & gloom picture of the future and capitalizes on the fear of the unknown. The real message of events that run counter to this book is that our infrastructure is stronger than anyone predicted and there is a reason to be optimistic about the future!
1,One star on principle,"I've skimmed the book at various places on the web (wouldn't dream of buying it). I presume 2012 will put us in a similar place. In fact, I'm thinking about writing my own scaremongering book about the coming apocalypse. Any publishers interested? I promise to pander to the interests of the Conservative Right, as well as the NRA and ATF."
1,The Millennium Hype,"Jan 3, 2000: Well, the author may have made what one reviewer called a ""convincing argument,"" but all that shows is how easily some of us are duped. The author, like much of the press, has tapped into our ignorance and gulliblity, and tried to scare the bejesus out of us. He should be ashamed! The millennium bug was averted not because of scare mongers like this so-called expert, but because the marketplace realized there would be a financial penalty for not fixing things. It's no more complicated than that. So have we learned anything, boys and girls?"
1,Y2K Bug? Was it worth the Hype?,Refile this to fiction as with all the other Y2K fear mongering material... sort of like the book 1984.1 Star cuz I can't get lower...
4,A must read book!!!,"You owe it to your loved one's to be prepared in the event of any emergency, if you are not you will have no one to blame but yourself. I hope all this information is not true , but I would rather err on the side of caution."
1,Author or Opportunist?,"I do not doubt that January 1, 2000 will be an unusual day. But I believe Mr. Hyatt has gone way overboard creating an atomosphere of chaos and panic. And why not? At $25 a book to say nothing of his $80 Y2K Survival Kit--he stands to make quite a tidy sum as a result of scaring a nation half out of its wits. Can you say irresponsible? Already a great deal of this book is obsolete because so much remediation has already been completed. If there is a problem it will be because of books like this that prey on ignorance -- not the Y2k situation itself. But please, Mr. Hyatt, don't feel like you need to write a sequel."
2,Could be better written,"This book would be much more credible if it were better written. Intelligent analysis and conclusions were absent--this book was written as if someone were writing a high-school report.Other than that, I suppose that it is a decent intro to the problem for the layman. The severity level that is suggested by the book would be easier to swallow if Hyatt were a better writer, and the material were more original."
3,Good Basic Book to give to skeptical relatives,"Very good overall basic book, but the language and treatment of the topic could have been less cursory. Would have been nice to see more analysis. Majority of book quoted other references without many conclusions. Not the best written book I've read, but I guess it *is* one of the first."
3,I still have nightmares,"Scared the beejeebers out of me. What I really missed was investment advice. Isn't it true that in times of crisis and confusion wealth often changes hands? I want those hands to be mine. Thanks for recommending The Survivor's Guide to The Year 2000 by David Epp. It really answered my questions on specifically what happens in the markets and how to profit - or at least how to protect what you have. Isn't he a Christian author and editor too? Although except for a couple of references to the coming changes in the world system and Europe, one couldn't tell though. When it comes to money the book is all business."
4,Made me think of vulnerabilities that I hadn't before.,"When I first began reading this book, I was turned off by what I thought was a ""sensational"" tone. However, I became engrossed, and by Chapter 4 ""When the Bottom Falls Out"" and following, I couldn't put it down. His description of arming yourself to protect yourself and loved ones gave me pause, as well as the possible threat of a less computer-dependant country (like China) taking advantage of our (potential) national Y2K vulnerabilities. I find myself coming down on the high end of Mr Hyatt's ""Brownout"" Scenario 1, and the low end of the ""Blackout"" Scenario 2. I would recommend this book to someone who wanted to know more about the potential impact of Y2K on our society."
5,An excellent summary of the Y2K issue for the layman,"Michael Hyatt's book on the Y2K computer problem provides the educated layman with a well-researched, clear explanation of the Y2K problem and its implications for individuals and their families. It methodically lays out the many dimensions of the problem, supported by evidence that can be verified by the reader.Hyatt's book goes beyond most of the reports that have appeared in the mainstream media to date and lays out the logical consequences of the problem for individuals and the society at large, in particular the problem of non-compliant embedded computer chips. The recommendations that Hyatt makes for prudently preparing for the impact of the Y2K problem are useful for beginning to develop a personal strategy for coping with the problem.The book is well written and well organized. I recommend it highly and consider it a ""must read"" for everyone."
2,Not just Christmas from Bobby Vee,"The sound of Bobby Vee lives in his Christmas music. Nothing spectacular here, but pleasant to listen to. A new take on familiar Christmas songs and some ""new"" ones to hear. On the non-Christmas part, the song Charms was the only song I recognized from my youth, and I was amazed that I could remember a few of the lyrics. The other songs were OK, but I don't remember ever hearing any of them. If you are a hugh Bobby Vee fan, you will probably love the entire album."
4,Epic-Length Music Video,"I found this movie when searching for horror flicks. I'm not sure why it was there because it wasn't really a horror movie (however experimental) at all but essentially a very long music video. The film used unique visual effects extensively and effectively to turn even mundane footage of family videoes or ocean waves into something extraordinary and even a little unsettling. The music was experimental stuff consisting of samples, synth, bass, and other elements I wasn't quite able to make out. I want to say it reminded me of Brain Eno and David Byrne's collaboration but that's not quite it either. Good stuff nonetheless."
3,very easy to use,This stylus is very easy to use I havelong nails and it makes work well with the fire no scratches on the screen.
1,Save your money,"Not worth the $8. The stylus works great, but the plug that attaches to the earphone port broke in less than a week and then the pocket clip came off. For $8 it should be a lot harder to break than just normal usage for a week. I get the feeling that the rubber tip may come off in the near future, but that hasn't happened yet."
4,c.clement,I received the stylus sooner than expected and am pleased with the quality. The stylus helps when trying to be more precise than using my fingertip. I love the blue color and would purchase again.
5,very small and short but good item,"Yes, this stylus works great and looks great the blue is modern in look but it's small never owning a tablet(Kindle Fire) I don't know if thats just the way they are there or if there are longer ones out there.I do most of my shopping on amazon and I will look at one the next time I'm out.Bought it used on the Amazon Marketplace and it was new in the box so for exceding my expectaions it's a 5 star great deal"
5,Love it,Works great & it's very light! Got a new Kindle HD 8.9 for Christmas so I had to have a stylus & this one caught my eye & I'm glad it did!
3,Stylus for Kindle touch,I like the stylus it does just what they said it would and it makes printing a word much easier. I was dissappionted in the shipping cost. I ordered 2 at a total cost of $14.00 and shipping was $10.00. I think that was way too high.
5,One of the best!,"This was my first Agatha Christie book, and it is definetely on of my favorites! The plot is excellent, and it is a must for everyone!"
5,Tommy and Tuppence,"I loved this Tommy and Tuppence book by Agatha Christie. Her writing was so prolific and yet each of her stories and books was special. It is fun to see the characters married and in their middle ages, yet as feisty and adventurous as ever."
5,N or M review,"This book, in the Kindle format, is one of the later books in the Tommy and Tuppence series. Agatha Christie does not break up the original grouping of characters, so even Arthur is brought back to play a pivotal role for all that it was not the highlight of the book. Her presentation of the characters at the boarding house where the book takes place does keep you guessing as to who the N or M characters are, in addition to the wandering female and the subset of other male characters that add to the plot. It was a good basic mystery that didn't take too much time to read and ended well, as they always do."
4,N or M mystery,I enjoy a good mystery and this book fills the bill. It is like a collection of short stories that all tie together.
3,A bit transparent - but provides a good wartime perspective,"This story has Tommy and Tuppence serving as spies during WWII. It is the third of five T&T mysteries that Agatha wrote, and fairly typical of the series. In the series, each story has T&T roughly 10-15 years older than the last, so you see how they age and how their adventures change over time. In N or M, T&T are middle aged, too old to enlist and too young to stand by and do nothing. The identities of the baddies were fairly evident to me rather early in the story and Tommy's rescue involves some rather unlikely coincidences (Albert the (former) butler makes a key appearance), but the story has its charms. It provides an interesting perspective on the British view of things during WWII. The anti-German bias is understandable but the characterizations of the Germans are stereotypical and simplistic."
2,Reading with Tequila,"N or M? is my least favorite Agatha Christie novel so far. Halfway thought the novel I realized that absolutely nothing of any importance has happened yet. I pushed on and found that the mystery came together nicely in the end. I'm glad I stuck with the book but half a novel of set-up before any action is pretty extreme. The book had it's rare moments of surprise, but not enough for me to ever recommend it to others."
2,Very disappointing,The first book of Agatha Christie's that I read was And Then There Were None. It was probably the best book I have ever read. I rushed out to get another one of her books and this was it. It ditn't even compare to And Then There None. I was very disappointed.
2,"Umm, not what I expected.","I thought the doll would have Audrey Hepburn's likeness, but it's just a Barbie doll. And the dress fabric is of just adequate quality. It's not fitted particularly well to the doll's frame. I'm fine with it but it is not as nice as my ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" doll. [...]. A bit disappointed in the quality and I'll make sure to look more carefully at the next one I choose."
4,Eliza Doolittle Barbie,"I have always regretted not purchasing this particular Barbie a very long time ago when it was issued. I am happy to have it now... I give it four stars because it is not ""Mint Condition"" like the others that I bought so long ago, but I have taken good care of mine! Nevertheless, it is the Barbie and I am glad to have it."
1,ripped off never got item,never got the item was ripped off no satisfaction from seller never buy again the star rating is ridiculous never received the item
4,Repetition pt. 4,"the music of The Fall is both engaging and off-putting...equal parts clever and brilliant mixed with the confounding and annoying. the casual fan of punk or post rock will probably be confused. and that my friends, may be the point. or maybe not. you decide. take a listen.Slates is great fun...but i'm wondering why it has been released seperately from the A Part Of America Therein, 1981 album. just to make room for bonus tracks? hmmm..."
3,The Marriage of Sticks,"I only gave it three stars because of the way it was written. I got confused a few times as the story changed all of a sudden. In a movie theater, people and places change and you can show it in different ways like fog or fade out. In this book I had to keep reading before I figured out this part wasn't of this earth. It was interesting enough to keep me reading, but it wasn't what my idea of past lives would be."
5,There's a door in the air.,"You are sitting in your chair reading, The Marriage of Sticks, by Jonathan Carrol, and suddenly there's a door flying on air. You don't think twice about the improbability of this strange appearance, but get up and turn the knob. Suddenly an aroma of every Christmas that wasn't spoiled cascades into your room...freshly baked cookies, cinnamon and spice, and everything nice. Now down the chimney comes a nightmare. It pulls up a chair beside you and is prepared to stay.You can put the book down. But memories are whizzing by like traffic on the Autobahn and surely illumination is near.Jonathan Carroll is a box of chocolates, the wind behind the door, the shadow that takes shape and draws you in. The Marriage of Sticks is about so much more than selfishness and sacrifice. If the doorbell rings while you're reading it - answer. It could be wonder come to call."
4,good but far from perfect,"I loved the first part of the book, introducing the characters and their plaes in the world. And the descriptions of falling in and out of love seemed a bit unrealistic but still beautifully written and I couldn't put the book down. And I loved the ending and where the whole book went. The middle section of the book, as the weird X-filesesque events start to happen and you don't really understand why, seemed clunky to me, and was not as enjoyable. In some ways I wish he could have figured out a smoother way to bridge the two wonderful parts."
3,Dazed and Confused,"Thank you for all of your reviews. They really helped me figure out this book. I had never read a Carroll book before. I bought this book because I liked the cover. And it confused the daylights out of me. The beginning of the book, the setup, was excellently written and cleverly devised, but then he seemed to forget the ending. The second half became a mismash of half plots and confusion."
1,Disappointing,"Picking it up at an airport (ok, so I have only myself to blame), the reviews on the cover looked quite good, promising strong plotline. However, it didn't take me long to get bored with a light stile of writing, a plot that never picks up speed (it just plain never gets going), and uninteresting characters. He works so hard describing Hasidic Jews in New York, but only makes it sound like he's trying too hard to make it interesting. Don't bother."
1,Oh dear,"This book starts off quite promisingly, and then descends into the worst trip I have read for many years. I would not be surprised to find ou that this s Dan Brown under psuedonym. I don't particularly like Dan Brown, but if this is him, then he has used the alias because it was not up to even his weakest piece of work. By page 250 I was getting so angry with the characters and plot that I had to give up. Drawn out, over complex, then stupidly simple.I have read some shockers, but always managed to get to the end - until now.I'm sorry Sam - but really."
2,If you have nothing better to do then read this book.,"This book is the equivalent of the movie you should wait to see on DVD, but only if a friend loans it to you, and then only if you've seen everything else.In the hands of a more competent author the premise might have resulted in a fascinating and thrilling story. However, there's nothing more painful than figuring out a story's ending and then reading 200+ pages for the supposedly bright and talented protagonist to figure it out also."
3,"Very far-fetched, mildly entertaining thriller","Like a couple of dozen other books, the blurbs on this book compares it to The Da Vinci Code, and there are similarities, but not many. Say what you will about The Da Vinci Code, it was a fast-paced and fun read. ""The Righteous Men"" suffers from an uneven pace, and if you thought The Da Vinci Code was unbelievable, this one is much more far-fetched. To begin with, the main premise is unbelievable, even supernatural, and then the plot has way too many convenient coincidences.Despite its flaws, ""The Righteous Men"" is somewhat entertaining. For his next novel, I hope Bourne tightens up the pace, and doesn't write long explanations for things we already figured out (this is especially true for the epilogue). Don't put this book first on your shopping list, but if you need something to read on the beach or on a flight, you could give it a chance."
5,very entertaining book,"Similarities to Da Vinci Code do exist in this book, however, the plot is much lighter - despite what it says on the jacket cover. Instead of an inside tour through Catholicism, we have an inside tour through Hasidic life, which I found fascinating. The plot was woven enough that the ending was a bit of a surprise, although one knew with all the pointing of fingers, that the ending would not be what was expected. Character development was good. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to other books by the author."
2,"An interesting concept, but please skip","I bought this because I wanted something to read on a long flight and the plot seemed interesting. But its so poorly written and drawn out that it fell apart on its own. I didnt give it one star because I did finish it (maybe I just wanted to say I gave it a chance. Pros are it flashes to the actual righteous men of the world getting killed one by one and their stories make you feel good and actually want to perform good deeds of your own. The cons are: he does such a poor job of expressing a husband looking for their kidnapped wife and his emotions. He has to write in that he is getting angry he can't find her, are you kidding me? And the whole ex girlfriend thing is ridiculous. He talks about her smell and their afternoons spent indoors about 40 times.As for a spin off on da vinvi code, I dont really see any similarities at all. Including da vinci code was good and this was not."
4,"A Good Read, and Learning for me","Many before either loved this book or just didn't like it for a variety of reasons. I have had the book for sometime, but just picked it up to read because the primise seemed intriguing. I was right about that for me. I learned a lot about the Hasidic Jews, New York, and the legend of lamad vav. For that alone was worth the read. I now wonder ""who are the 36?""."
4,Not a bad effort... entertaining,"I enjoyed THE RIGHTEOUS MEN, for all the Hassidic cultural things the author got right, but one not familiar with Kabbalistic Judaism would miss. Like the DeVinci Code, or The Red Tent -- fictionalizing religious worlds involves arcane vocabulary that requires exposition; necessary narratives that slow the action down. It's tough to pull off, but I think it's done well here. The legend of the 36 Righteous is a good ""what if"", but the way they were found -- gamatria codes, was a stretch; but hey -- it was a stretch consistent with the context. All-in-all, an entertaining read that highlights the joy and kindness within the Crown Heights world."
3,Let down,The first part of the book was very good Liked the characters and the way it developed. Everything came together in the end but the kay was so too unbelieveable.
5,good beach read,"I really enjoyed this. I am sorry butI do have to compare it the the DaVinci Code. I like learning about the 36 righteous men. It held my interest to the end. It gave me something to read and I wondered what would happen next. I rarely read these kind of books. I usually read women's fiction. But, I like the delving into the kabbalah and the righteous men. Something I don't know anything about. Maybe, because I am jewish it held my interest. And you never hear anything about the ultraorthodox(Chabad)."
3,Rabbits pulled out of the hat too many times,"After reading the word ""righteous"" one too many times, I had no trouble figuring huge chunks of the plot, as will anyone literate in Judaism. In short, the plot is predictable, and odd coincidences are just rabbits pulled out of the writer's hat, I regret having to say. This book is good for those who need to pass the time in an airport waiting room; it moves fast, but the characters need greater development than they have here. There are also inconsistencies in the plot--the book could have used some critical copy-editing. The book is is fast-moving, and, I grant, more believable than the Dan Brown series."
3,No DV Code,"Considered in a book review as better than the DV Code, it isn't. Good in parts, silly in others. Might enthral Jewish readers more."
2,Not bad-but not really a Bogie Movie,"This movie is hyped as ""Starring Humphrey Bogart,"" however, when you sit down to watch it, Bogie's camera time last all but 3 1/2 minutes. The premise is interesting though--as it provides a moral dilemma that's still got an edge. Maybe a good candidate for a remake..."
2,Tough Guy,"Unfortunately I quickly discovered that this movie has one major problem, is soundtrack doesn't match the active. The copy I received the soundtrack is several seconds behind the action, which is very annoying, to the point I wasn't able to finish the movie. Classic Bogart."
2,For Bogart diehards only,"First off, I'm reviewing the movie, not the physical DVD product. This is an early film featuring Bogart that would surely be forgotten if he wasn't in it. The other actors are melodramatic and the story, even with its ""twist"" ending, is a bit too mechanical to enjoy. Bogart is the best thing about it, but people didn't seem to realize it at the time and his role is not that big. As usual at this time he played a gangster type, and I don't want to give anything away, but I swear that Bogart got shot to death more than any other actor in the 1930s!I'm a huge Bogart fan and I've sought out anything I could find with him. This is worth seeing once if you also love Bogart, but if you're just a casual film viewer, avoid it. There's plenty of better Bogart films."
1,another Madacy Entertainment ...,"Just like most other titles from Madacy Entertainment, this digital copy is unwatchable. Sound out of sync from video, hiss, scratch and pop sounds continuously, image jumps around and is unsteady. No disclosure of any faults on the dust jacket. Puke in a box!"
3,A women has been convicted of first degree murder. She,will be executed tonight. This much seems certain. The movie is billed as a Psycho-drama. Is there such a genre'?The foreman of the jury that convicts the women is a tortured soul. So is his daughter. She seems to have internalized the condemned woman's plight. The foreman also seems to be very chummy with the prosecuting DA. The daughter is in love with a shady character. That where Bogart comes in. At this point it's really no spoiler to discover he has been murdered. That very night he decides to dump her. She doesn't take it well. She confesses the whole thing to her family. Her father the foreman calls the DA. Still that night he comes right over. They begin to spin her confession. To have a women murder her lover the same way on the same night another women is being executed is very dicey for the foreman as well as the DA. Especially if it is the foreman's daughter. That's it in a nutshell. Good late night fare.
2,"OK, I will: it's murder.","Looks as if it was written and directed by a couple of kids still at school. I can remember being in amateur theatricals like this when I was about 16 or 17. The director has a few visual ideas; eg, the wooden bars of a staircase banister turn into the iron bars of the condemned cell. Not that there's a lot of point to that one. The upshot of the story is that it's right to pursue the letter of the law, no matter how unpopular it makes you, or how strong your psychological empathy with the accused --- even if she's your own daughter. Quaint, in a way. Yes, Bogart is in it, just about. Was this his first turn as a baddie, after playing matinee idols?"
2,Diagrams way too small,"This otherwise very nice and interesting book is made pretty much unusable by the fact that the diagrams are way too small to read, even with magnification."
5,Well pleased with performance of this tool.,"I was having trouble finding a spring compressorto work on motocycles. Rented a couple, had tobuy a few, and fortunately were able to returnthem. I believe this spring compressor will fitevery application if you need to compress aspring with the cylinder head removed. Comeswith five different sizes, fits valves well.Worked great on my Honda Magna VF700C."
3,works on 1.8t vw and audi,"I got this tool to do vw Audi 5valve motors and it works fine, it did bend slightly, but the tool is not real high quality but will get the job done. Well worth the price."
2,Great for small OHC heads but weak for tougher springs.,This worked great on my OHC Volvo cylinder head. However it bent on my stock worn out 80 pound valve springs on Ford E7TE heads.
5,This is a GREAT book!,"I read a lot of mystery books. And most of them are about women and/or by women. And I've read all of the Lee Harris Christine Bennett books. But this book is the best mystery I've read in a long, long time! And nothing against the Bennett books but this one is a cut way above them. It is much more than a police procedural - but it is that, too. Great and evolving characters, good mystery - if this is the beginning of a series, I can't wait for the next one."
3,"Misleading, to say the least.","Jennifer Darling has put together a fine little book, let me say that.... If you've never tossed salad, this book is for you. Darling teaches you lots of wonderful ways to continually keep your salad tossing moments fresh and exciting."
5,Oh Yeah!,"Oh Yeah, this is what it's all about. For me, the best smelling Nag Champa I've used. The real deal. Pure class and the aroma lingers so nicely. I won't buy the blue Nag anymore, the red is so much cleaner smelling, intense and deep."
3,"Good, but not as great as everyone says","So I got some of these because everyone is saying that they're the best. They were ok, good even. I like the Satya Sai Babas better; they have a piquant spice note to them that these don't have.I like the Sairam in the yellow box better too (though they're hard to find). These are more along the lines of Super Hit to me. Flowery and sweet. Nice odor, but without the ""edge"" of the Sai Baba or the Sairam.I don't know what the Sai Baba odor was like before c.2005 when they supposedly reformulated their sticks, because I was buying really cheap stuff back then (I know, the shame). But they work for me.So, in summary, these are good. They definitely have their own aroma, which isn't quite like anything out there. I'm glad I tried them out, but there are other, ""spicier"" sticks that I would go for before these."
5,Better than the Blue,"I love this one, so much nicer than the blue Nag Champa ... hard for me to explain why, but give this one a try if you love the higher end incense.You wont be disappointed !!"
3,I QUESTION,"I fell in love with NAG CHAMPA incense through the blue box. After the blue box incense burns, a pleasant aroma lingers in the home for three days. With this red box stuff, the aroma is gone the day that it is burned. The blue NAG CHAMPA has holograms sealing the box. This red box just has a stuck on NAG CHAMPA label. I am wondering if what I bought, is the real NAG CHAMPA incense."
3,OK,"SMELLS PRETTY GOOD...BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE BRAND IN THE BLUE BOX, THAT NAG CHAMPA IS THE BEST ONE!"
3,"Love original Nag Champa, but didn't care for this","Love original Nag Champa, but didn't care for this. It just smelled too much like the cheap 10-for-a-dollar incense. ."
1,Absolutely horrible,Burned one in my yoga room. I regret doing that very much. This smells like there was a fire in the room. Not a lovely scent like wood logs burning in the fireplace. Rather like pure acrid smoke. Yuck. The package looked like it had been damp at one time as it was misshapen turned hard as a rock in some places. The thin plastic covering over the box was stuck on in spots but dried to a crisp so difficult to remove. Just made me suspicious of the way it was stored. Didn't smell potent and fresh. But I burned it anyway and now have to air out my room for a few days.
3,apron review,"I was not happy with the material used in the making of this apron. This is the problem of buying on-line, you can't feel the material. Must have nylon or polyester in it. I would have liked either cotton or duck.I gave it as a gift.I can only hope the person likes it better than I."
4,"Nice Apron, But A Little Small","The embroidery is very nice, and the quality of the apron is good, I just wish it were a little larger. It works well, but the point of an apron is to protect your clothes from splatter, so the bigger the better, right?"
4,Howard's No Quack--This Is Fine Stuff,"Garageland's follow-up to 'Last Exit To Garageland' isn't quite the fizzy caffeine rush their debut was, but make no mistake: this is great stuff.Songs with more hooks than a tackle box, great playing, great, emotive singing--this is aural one-stop shopping.By virtue of it's tidied-up, more muscular production and more streamlined songs, 'Do What You Want' seems a bit of a calculated attempt to penetrate radio's hermetically-sealed playlists--albeit a very worthy one. Very little would sound better on the drive home than ""Love Song"".I'd recommend this (and their even-better debut) to anyone in love with concise, three minute symphonies punctuated with wonderfully direct guitar playing. All ooze the inimitable, understated charm of New Zealand pop.Garageland is a treasure."
5,This band just gets better and better,"I'll make this short and sweet: I love this album. I love their first album. BUT, their new album ""SCORPIO RISING"" (Amazon--add an entry!) is an absolute masterpiece---Jeremy Eade is one turning into one heck of a songwriter. There are 3 A-1 songs that should be major US hits: ""Gone"", ""Who The Hell Do You Think You Are"", and ""Highway"", accented by a fistful of great rock tracks. As a US DJ, those tunes are already on my personal playlist. A digitally recorded album, it's an absolute MUST for any rock music lover. Anyone who is a fan, pick up the import (via NotLame) or wait for the late Sept release on Foodchain."
2,It's Hard to Be Hip Over Thirty,"I was disappointed because I bought it for my eldest granddaughter turning 30--but it's all about a young married woman--with small children! My two eldest granddaughters commented that that's behind the times--at least for them--not married yet--and for sure no children.Instead I used the When Did I Stop Being Twenty for both, fortunately had ordered two copies thinking I was planning ahead--"
5,A fascinating study,The material in this book is thousands of years old but amazing in how modern the approach is to horsemanship. Most of Xenophon's advice is timely even today. It shows how little has changed over the centuries.
5,Horses beware,My daughter is an avid gatherer of horse information and had been looking for this book but in the wrong places. We went onto Amazon website and found it quickly and for a few dollars less. Very happy with the book and great service--received it quickly!
1,f***in rip off,"if u look under product features...u'll see...""Box of 6 Reebok balls"". i only received one, this ball sucks, the ppl that sell this should try playin w/ it..."
3,Never read it,"Just a free app on my kindle, but the kindle is awesome and comes with several of these like moby dick and such."
5,A Gem If You Can Find It,"I was just looking at the reviews for their first album 'Red And Clear'. Never really got into that- a little too wilfully obscure and lacking hooks for me but this, their second and final album is quite different. A lot more tunes, retaining the rawness and strained vocals but with really excellent musicianship and almost Pixies-like stop/start dynamics this is a great album from beginning to end. Can't believe noone's reviewed it yet.Part of the 'first wave' of emo bands such as Promise Ring, Braid, Christie Front Drive, Mineral etc, Giants Chair never really got the recognition they deserved and I have no idea why. I believe the drummer went on to be in the Farewell Bend."
5,1800's CSI Cheney and Shilo style!,"I waited very impatiently for this newest installment to the Inheritance series and I'm completely satisfied with it! Once again, another great book from the Morris duo. I can only hope for more Cheney and Shiloh books! I'd hate to see them go!Trying to escape the brutal NY winter, Cheney and Shiloh take Cheney's parents and her brother Dev's family to winter in the balmy South. When they arrive at the house that Victoria has rented, they discover a body in the cellar and so much more! I love reading about Cheney's pure enthusiasm when faced with the prospect of doing an autopsy and looking at slides of ""liver juice and eyeball jelly"" (as Minerva puts it). I also thought it was very clever that Grinder's will involved the use of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"". Great book, highly recommended!"
4,There is a Season (Cheney and Shiloh: The Inheritance),"As always the authors, Lynn & Gilbert Morris have done well again. The story holds your interest and the continuing history of Cheney's family enfolding is fun to read. My only suggestion is that I would like to see Cheney & Shiloh's relationship develop more."
1,tried it,"I placed it on a TC 22-250 and took it to the range over a period of two months. I went out at least once a weekshooting a 100 yards. I would make a adjustment, the scope would move anywhere from nothing to 3 inch per oneclick. Never did get it to hold. Put on a Tasco it zeroed on first try and held. Half the price. I have twoother Nikons Pro Staff BDC's they work great. The Buckmaster doesn't work!"
1,defective item and not as advertised,"The item is advertised as the BDC(bullet drop compensating) reticle. The one that was sent is the cheaper version called Nikoplex.After taking it to Cabela's for bore sighting, I went to the gun range for sighting in the scope.After firing a few rounds to get a group starting at 25 yards then to 50 yards etc. I was stuck at the 50 yard target. it was firing to the left by about 2 inches. I made 2 clicks to the right and it still fired into the same group, I made 2 more clicks and nothing.....after 16 clicks, still nothing. The windage is not adjusting at all.I talked to Amazon.com and they said that because it was no longer in new condition, they couldn't do anything for me. No exchange, no return. I recommend purchasing from somewhere like Cabela's where they would exchange it on the spot even 90+ down the road even with no original packaging.**update...after fighting back and forth with amazon, and this review, they agreed to do a one time exception exchange."
4,The Sackett clan rides to the rescue.,"Somebody ambushed Tell Sackett and left him for dead. It takes more, however, than cowardly sidewinders to kill a Sackett. Even worse, Tell's wife is missing. After Tell determines that somebody of Lazy A ranch is guilty, he launches a one-man war against the cowboys. Word spreads of the conflict, and Sackett brothers and cousins come out of the sagebrush to even the odds.Typical of Louis L'Amour, this novel is a quick hit of Western action. The Sackett tales stress family solidarity. L'Amour is adept at writing of the lure of distant trails, the freedom of the big sky country, and the Code of the West. He breathes new life and spirit into the usual elements of Western fiction. This is good downtime reading. Enjoy the ride. ;-)"
2,"Over the top, stretches credibility too far.","Not one of Louis L'Amour's best. He stretches credibility too far. How can a single man, make a woman, a wagon and a team of mules vanish while mustering cattle with his forty cowboys , in country where everybody is an expert tracker. Also our hero, Tell Sackett, hides himself out in this wild country, but gets himself discovered with great regularity by the searching bad guys, not to mention a bad woman. The rest of the Sackett clan are given a great build up, but play disappointingly minor parts. However they come from all over the west and turn up together just in the nick of time to save our hero from impossible odds."
5,Sacketts Brand,"I'll take anything written by Louis L'Amour anytime, especially the Sacketts, I've got them all right from the first one all the way down their line (family tree), if u want a good western yarn I'd recommend this guy,he knows how to tell a imaginable story, I've also got a couple DVD about the Sacketts, Sam Elliot plays William Tell Sackett, which this book is about"
4,Not bad at all,"If you like plentiful angst then this will probably appeal, and it even has some depth. Sunnie grows up in a stubbornly backwards and strictly religious rural community, ignorant of just about everything except his own difference from others. Things go wrong, then an outsider rescues him for less than altruistic reasons. Sunnie has to come to terms with the world outside his own, narrow society. The process is pretty realistic, by the standards of slash at least. So far, so good, but from here on the novel is less well developed. We don't see too much of the guy Sunnie will end up with, nor is there much of their relationship when it finally comes about. Still, I enjoyed reading this and I thought Sunnie was a well-developed character, even if the others tend to be a bit vague. I'm glad I bought it."
4,d-Alpha,"I just received this item today, so I can't speak for its long-term efficacy. I did want to pop in to say that this is d-Alpha vitamin e (natural) as opposed to dl-Alpha (synthetic). The only other ingredient is extra virgin olive oil. I uploaded a couple of photos of the label. The bottle came sealed with an expiration date of 05/16. This was sold and fulfilled by Amazon.I purchased this for use on my skin, but I tasted it. It definitely tastes like a vegetable/plant derived oil, and taste of the olive oil is distinct as well. None of that odiferous, furniture polish scented, lemon oil wannabe crap. I tested it on the inside of my arm, and after it absorbed I feel minimal to no oily residue -- very nice.Due to its obvious freshness, high potency, natural origins, and sealed bottle with a lengthy time until expiration, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and rate it 4 stars. If it doesn't break me out I'll come back and give it 5.Enjoy! :-)"
1,garbage,"i stayed up all night to watch this on the movie channel because i wanted to see fred williamson(i love Him) but this movie was garbage, the script, the color, i thought something was wrong with my tv. the non acting from every last one of the characters. i already knew that jim kelly couldn't act he is a fighter not an actor. but honestly jim kelly probably was the best actor in the film. oh yeah did i mention that the script was horrible. and this is coming from a fred williamson fan."
2,Whoa!,"I bought this(yes) because I wanted to see what Jim Kelly and other looked like goin into the 80's. I see...The picture quality is very clear and clean. The sound is what it is. The dialuoge is hardly there. The plot...? The story setup was not there. You wonder what it's all about and then once you know, you still have a hard time knowing what it is. The worst part has to be the directing. This was direced by Fred Williamson. If you ever thought that there was no such thing as bad directing, look at most decent to great films, then get this.They tried to relive some of Richard roundtree's Shaft persona, but this movie sucks. Not as bad as other say, but bad. I have seen worse. I was wondering where that trailer aired.All of thew stars must have been out of work at that time in order to think that this would work. I wonder how much they got paid.To the guy who said that he was an actor in the film, what part did you play? I am curious. What was Jim Kelly's last film?"
5,One down two to go,One down two to go is a great movie and to those of you that haven't saw it yet please go on amazon.com and order it. It is a great movie.
4,See It,"I thought this movie was a hoot from the start. The opening martial arts scenes look real and professional, but then it goes straight into classic blaxploitation and revenge movie mode: the script is corny and terrible, camera work is strange, the actors sometimes look like they are having trouble keeping a straight face, the violence is cartoonish (except for Kelly's & his opponent's work--he can't help being a pro martial artist), some of looks like it was shot in somebody's back yard and more than I want to write right now. It's not ""Coffy"", my favorite of this genre, but if you like this kind of movie, it's definitely worth watching."
1,One down two braincells to go for this director.,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. If they wanted to make more money they would be better served selling the DVD as a coaster.
1,MST3K HERE I COME!!!,"This movie had to be the worst thing I ever saw ( Next to Pearl Harbor). How this did not end up on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 I will never know! It is the stupids thing ever. The script was writen by a five year old. The acting is horrible. The editing of the film is discusting. They keep looping footage over and again. The cinematography was pale and down right bad. If u want a good laugh rent One Down Two to Go tonight!! (LOL, this movie ...!) HAHAHAHAHA I can't stop laughing.."
4,"excellent book; you will be angry, sad and happy","it's a book that will leave you frustrated and yet somehow elated at the results. Two U.S. Army Generals face off behind the scenes of a ficticous quagmire war based in Columbia, with the lives and careers of Army officers at stake."
5,Excellent!,This CD is wonderful for any VNV Nation fan. I've listened to this album time and time again and truly a great album.I highly suggest purchasing this album!
2,Laughable for VNV,"So this is what goes for VNV these days? there are a few good songs on this album, but it just doesnt go THERE. I'm not just against this album because its not ""old"" VNV, i am a fan of Matter and Form, which after a couple of listenings gets to you. This album however is lyrically depressing, and not 'good' depressing, but dissapointingly depressing. Ronan seems to have run out of inspiration on this one, almost like he knows what will work and just pounds it out of a cookie cutter. musically it doesnt really push hard, but face it, not too many people would listen to VNV if there were no lyrics. Without inspired lyrics, which is what draws most people to them, there really isnt much there to drive the music. sorry, but you should skip this one and put your money into somthing truly inspired like Coded Message: 12 from [:SITD:], which is probably the least known classic of the newer electro-industrial music.sorry Ronan, better luck next time...."
2,Catchy but Boring,VNV are now writing pop songs disguised as EBM. Some of the songs are catchy in a top 40 sort of way but the album is bland and boring. These are also the worst lyrics Ronan has written since VNV's inception. Terribly disappointing album as I rate it as their worst.
2,"Failure,flatline, and with lots of whine","I dunno what to say to VNV. They have let down true EBM clubbers for sometime now. I don't hear much from them in the club scene either. If any songs get played from this yester-year wonder, It's from Pre-Futureperfect era of VNV. I find the Judgement CD whiney and overdone. Maybe VNV needs some cheese with its whine now? I've been active in the EBM scene for over 12+ years now and still wonder how a great band like this turned so bad? Seriously pass on this CD. I highly doubt you will hear any of Judgment or their past few CD releases at any EBM clubs in time to come."
4,Different that all previous VnV,"It is not what i expected, but i grew to love it. It's hard for me to pin down... but i think that its because even though the lyrics are a bit darker, the instrumentals are a bit ""poppier"" I think thats what initially put me off.I picked up the cd the week before seeing vnv live. I will be honest, my initial thought was oh no, what have they done? However its one of those rare cd's that the more i listen to it the more i love it. I also think seeing it performed live that pushed me over the edge.Ronan was fantastic at the show we went to and really made the songs work. If you get the chance to see them live its worth every penny and more."
5,Fantastic and Brilliant !,"This was quite inspiring,I had given up almost all hope in music when this cd crossed my path. You simply must buy this if you want to hear the future of electronic pop music. it seems that Mr. Harris has again outdone himself, from the indie dance (almost rocking) ""Farthest Star"" to the beautiful ballad of ""illusion"" this cd will make you want to get up and dance then sit down to cry. There are a few drawbacks here(seeing as how I have moved passed the whole Goth/dark wave/spoken word of ""descent"" ) however they are not enough to hold the raw power and emotion of this disc back. there even seems to be a bit of Peter Gabriel in ""Carry You""; it's quite possibly the best of their catalogue."
2,Uninspired floorkillers & strangled prose...,"I'm a huge fan of VNV Nation, but this CD was just as huge a letdown. It seemed like they were aiming for a sound that is dancefloor friendly or regurgitating sounds from past songs (one song, ""Momentum"", even sounds like ""Interceptor"" from Matter + Form). Also, these are the worst lyrics Ronan Harris has ever written. When it's not uninspired, it's laughably strangled (from Descent: ""Limitless are the ways of mankind in its virulent capacities"". Huh?). I just hope this isn't a trend, and ""Of Faith, Power and Glory"" proves to be a return to glory for them."
5,Great PC.,I have had this pc for about a week. Its a great machine. Yes it still has the usual lags like most machines every once in awhile but its better than the other ones I've seen. The only drawback that I see is that the hard drive is very loud. It sounds like its grinding all the time.
2,"Manufacturing, Shipping, and Handling Problems","My Hp a350n arrived with its packing material crushed. There is a 1 inch scratch, white on gray, on the top front of the tower and the cd-rom door appears to have not been installed properly. It is hanging open at an angle. I am attempting to bring the computer up now but the flopping cd-rom door, which makes loading software from cds tricky, and the ugly scratch are a distraction."
2,"Cheap, cut-corner design","My employer (a small software company) just bought these for all the developers (including myself). They're barely faster than the Athlon XP 2000+ workstations they replaced. HP cut several corners with this model:- There are no available internal or external drive bays- The power supply is only 250W- They skimp on the RAM, using DDR333 instead of DDR400 despite the 800FSB processor- The hard drive is mounted in a bizarre plastic vertical bracket which isn't very secure and tends to vibrate- There are no CDs included with the system (except one Microsoft Works disc). There are no restore CDs, let alone Windows install discs (but my Pavilion ze4240 notebook I bought a year ago came with both--shame on HP for backing down on that).Since the systems shipped with XP Home and we need Pro, we reformatted the hard drives. And now we have no way of installing the DVD burning software that came with the systems. HP wants $9 for an HP RecordNow install disc."
2,just ok.,"The dictionary has lots of examples. That's good.On the other hand, it is deficient in pronunciations. Also, it has very intrusive politically correct examples (feminist, environmentalist, political)."
5,Fun to read and intellectually stimulating,"Professor Roach manages to keep the topic interesting while actually exploring it intellectually. She is an engaging writer as well as a serious academic. She moves way beyond stripping into deep issues affecting all of us. Her point of view is unusual in a book of this type as she has never been a stripper herself and yet brings a very open mind to the subject. She shares with the reader how a close friend became a stripper and that began her interest in the subject. The book is very well researched and intellectually stimulating. I particularly liked the chapter on stripping and the Goddess, called ""At the Feet of the Goddess"". I imagine that anyone with an interest in Feminism, sexual ethics, sex work, patriarchy or that enjoys original and creative thinking in general would enjoy this book and it would be a ""must read"" for any real inquiry into stripping."
4,Another range war in the old west,"This Louis L'Amour novel is another variation of the familiar plot of land ownership vs. squatters but with a different twist. A ruthless speculator wants to wrest control of an area where a great cache of Spanish gold may be hidden and hires an outfit of hard cases to get rid of the settlers and their town of Yellow Butte. The story is similar to L'Amour's ""The Tall Stranger"", with the same elements of a super cowboy, murdering gunslingers and romance in place. A mysterious grulla, a mouse-colored pony, seems to be the key to the puzzle and points the hero straight to the source of all the mayhem and murder. A nice story in the L'Amour tradition of justice and fair play."
3,Neither Red nor Green,"This book, though a classic regular western as any of the other L'amours is not what you could call the best, like Daybreakers, or Last stand at Papago wells. The action part is not as fast paced as usual, with less emotions emanating in you. Moreover, the courting and love part is also desultry. If you generally like the westerns of L'amour, you can read it in one go, but the high points are few and far apart."
5,Health and Happiness,"An excellent DVD for anyone considering starting a qigong practice, or looking for a simple practice that fits their busy lifestyle. The DVD is very easy to follow, and Mr. Ardo's energy is wonderful."
2,Toy-like,"These looked like a good set of simple speakers for my pc, but the fact that they sound tinny, as well as the issue of having no volume knob, or headphone jack, makes them pretty useless."
2,Do not work with Windows 7,"Samsung Pleomax Digital USB Speaker 2.0Bought new PC with Windows 7. Could not upgrade the speakers driver. Samsung does not offer one, forums did not help either. Speakers are not bad but uselesss now..."
5,Concise and thorough reading for any web designer,"I'm always hungry for new knowledge as a web designer, looking for that one trick to make my site either faster, easier to understand, accessible, and better. Sure, you could scour the web for weeks, looking for all the little tips and tricks that makes a good website great, or you can get this book and discover it all easily. All from a person who has, for many years, made the web a better place.Molly's attention to detail, her teaching methods, and approach to giving these secrets and tips makes is utterly easy to digest and remember. By all means, this book is a treasure trove of knowledge that belongs in every web designer's personal collection."
5,Diamond in the Rough!!!!,"Great book!Very complete overview and many snippets of experience.I only called it ""in the Rough"" because of the paper & binding... it isn't shiney, and no color prints, but the info is the Diamond, and worth much more. As they say, ""Don't judge a book by its cover""!Molly's books are always worth keeping. She delivers. =)Cal"
2,It's ok...,"This book is ok and has a few decent tips in it, but for the most part there isn't anything in here that you couldn't find with a few minutes and Google. I keep it on my desk with a couple pages marked but that's really about it."
3,Wonderful! with gaps :-(,"This is a wonderful teacher's manual with all of the memorable songs, games, and exercises that I remember as a child learning Japanese from my grandmother. It's definitely on the right track! For fluent teachers and those literate in Japanese culture and folk songs it's wonderful. There are complete exercises and photo-ready material for making visual aides or flash cards. For others less fluent or uncertain of their Japanese, there are gaping holes in the material. There is no Japanese - English translation of any of the vocabulary used. Also, there is no music to accompany the lyrics included for the songs. These are unfortunate gaps for an otherwise wonderful book."
1,Small Birds,Bought this for my Umbrella Cockatoo. Within 1 hour it was compltely distroyed.Not worth the money
4,A Completely Different Approach,"This book takes a new approach to dating, courtship and selecting a mate. I wish I had read this before starting to date."
2,"Soft Porn, no doubt about it.","This wasn't bad but be aware that Amazon only sells soft porn, which this is. Save your money and watch Cinemax."
1,Not Very Enticing,"The women were kind of boyish looking. I am not sure where the pictures on the cover came from, because the okay looking blonde was only briefly in the film. Too much talking, and a lot of obviously fake interacting. I guess I don't like to get to know the characters that well... it ruins the fantasy. Also, the characters weren't very appealing, even when they weren't talking, which wasn't often. My husband and I just ended up taking it out and watching something else."
5,Excelente producto,"El producto me llegó en excelentes condiciones hasta Honduras, recomiendo para que puedan hacer sus compras mediante este usuario; no tuve ningun problema en la llegada de mi compra."
4,Fits well,"The mats fit well in the 2nd row area of my Mariner. The mats aren't as easy to clean, it's not really just ""hose it off"" as I thought. You will want a brush to stir up the dirt then it will come off ok."
2,Mixed Results/Botched editing job,"I found this a very frustrating book, because it could so easily have been a first-rate text. It is one of the few in print which includes both classic and contemporary essays by both philosophers and artists, and ""covers"" the basic topics. Unfortunately, many of the texts are cut down to such tiny snippets that major parts of the essential arguments and even some widely-quoted passages (e.g. in Plato, Bell, Bullough, Kant), are missing. On the other hand, there are long essays reprinted, with virtually no cuts, which are not only not ""classic"" but which strike me as quite absurd. For example, there are only 9 1/2 pages from Kant's Critique of Judgment, but 8 pages of nonsense (or, ""postmodern paradoxes"") about ""The Fine Art of Rap."" Disappointing!"
1,Transmitting to another audience,"808 has evolved into something that I can't relate to anymore. I used to love, love, love their ingenuity, but they've cut their cord, and are flying off to the bleeps, whirrs and moans of a horror movie in outer space. I don't get it.... It'd be nice to see them work with more singers on their next try, just to see if that would bring their focus back to this world."
3,808 is back,"Pretty good album. You can still pick out the classic 808 sound, even as it is drowned out by the drum 'n' bassy style that comes with this new one. Been a while since i heard from one of my favorite electronic acts. I like what i har, as always with them. Never a disappointing moment. Beats are a lot quicker than previous albums."
5,Seriously Funny!!!,"I'm so happy this film is finally out on DVD. I caught ""PARK"" at CineVegas (where it won the ""Audience Award"") and let me tell how refreshingly funny this film is! As festival-goers know, the films that are ordinarily programmed at most fests tend toward somber, turgid and suicidal.Not so with ""PARK"". They crowd was howling with laughter throughout the film. The Baldwin puts in a hysterical performance as an Alpha-male who arrives for a rendezvous with the uber-hot Izabella Miko: latex gloves, french maid outfit, say no more. Cheri Oteri & Ricki Lake give new meaning to the term coitus-interruptus. Suffice to say, it's a ""nooner"" you'll not soon forget.Fortunately for comedy-lovers, what happened in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas. This is one DVD I'm going to own!"
5,Delightfully Surprised!,"A friend recommended this movie. What a surprise!I was really entertained by the straightforward storyline. But, most of all, I LOVED the characters and casting. The female characters were smart and witty, leaving the males looking a little like dunces and frauds. Very satisfying.A great look at LA...the real LA....in a real (gritty) LA PARK.Highly recommend!"
5,One of the few movies worth watching these days,"My husband and I sat down to watch this movie, as it came highly recommended by a friend. We both we are little unsure when we read about it, but decided to give it a chance. He is a much tougher critic than I - but we both really enjoyed it. My husband had nothing but good things to say about it (and never said he thought it was a chick flick as it had been called in another review (""quasi-chick flick"")). We agreed that it was a terrific movie and it was one of the better movies we have watched in a long time. I felt that there were elements we could relate to, many times when we were laughing, and it kept us genuinely entertained for the entire movie. What more could you ask for?"
1,"Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of ""comedy""","I watched about 30 minutes of this,(recorded from TV) and then boredom set in. Bad acting and weak attempts at humor finally made me skim through it - something I very seldom do. I finally just erased it and went to bed. I envy the people who find this hilarious - they must enjoy life a lot more than I do. (Just kidding, of course.) For a more sophisticated review of this so-called hilarious movie, check the Rotten Tomatoes review. The film gets half of a star from that reviewer."
3,Something is Missing,"While this book is most interesting , something is missing. Why does Tarasov completely leave out The Soviet Olympic Team losing to the US Olympic Team in the 1980 Olympics? Herb Brooks was an avid student of Tarasov and would often track him down with a bottle of vodka and pry the master for information he could use to develop his US teams to emmulate the great Soviet squads. Could it be the conflict between Brooks and AHAUS that this portion of Soviet history was blantently edited out? Shame on USA Hockey if this is the case!"
4,Wonderful wisdom and insight!,"These audio CD's are excellent. They have brought to the surface questions I had not fully formulated, and helped me to answer them. Very thought-provoking and potentially life-changing!"
3,"Very sharp metal , plastic breaks",Got this for Christmas. It is very sharp. First two months the base cracked and was useless. Next the sides but I could still use it. Finally the ends of the handle cracked and it fell off. I still use it because it is the sharpest grater I have but i wish the plastic parts were sturdier and holding onto the metal edge to stabilize it is a pain. I did put it in the dishwasher occasionally but i have similar plastic gadgets that have not been effected.
2,"Sharp, but doesn't last","I've had this grater for a few years, and recently it has developed a series of cracks in the plastic, radiating way from the seam between the steel grating surfaces and the plastic body: its a total loss.I've always hand washed the item, so excessive heat can't be the cause. Rather, it looks like residual stress left in the plastic from when sheet metal was hot bonded to the plastic. Bad design and bad choice of materialsBox graters are one of those things you should only have to buy once or twice in you life- they really don't wear out. I'd recommend avoiding this one."
3,Box grater,"I dont have much to add as the other reviewers are spot on. I must have missed the fine print because two times through the dishwasher and the handle broke. The base has cracks as well. Excellent grater but mine is now held together with a big blue rubber band. If you buy it, do not run it through the dishwasher."
2,sharp but plastic fails,"Very nice grater until the plastic on the sides starts cracking. Took about 2 years and then it all fell apart, that's too soon for such a high price. Used about once a week at home and always washed by hand. Bought it because of the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated. Big mistake. My mother has a box grater she's used for over 50 years."
2,works well but doesn't last long...,I have had this grater for about a year and yes it still grates cheese quite well but the plastic (acrylic I assume) sides look like crap! The metal grating surfaces flex a little under normal use and it causes the sides to crack at the joint between metal and plastic. It's not falling apart or anything but it doesn't look very nice. I'm shopping for a new grater!
2,Great grater; self-destructs in dishwasher,"Very sharp, produces excellent results. But...the dishwasher will quickly eat away the plastic sides that hold the handle. Why have plastic parts at all? By all means buy one if you want to hand-wash it."
5,Excellent!,"The Cuisipro box grater is easy to hold, with a convenient, easily removed bottom cover so that your grated cheese doesn't fly all over the place. It's extremely well made, and a definite asset in the kitchen!"
3,Basic information.,"A pretty nice read, generally informative. I found it entertaining and a worthwhile read, even if a bit dated.I would recommend it to others also looking for general information on the subject."
1,Not as Advertised,This DVD is little more then an commercial.You learn nothing about actually flying one.It really isn't even a good overview of flying a trike.
5,The window at the white cat,I rate this book highly because it is so well written.THE twists and turns of the plot keep me interested from beginning to end.
4,Not Bad.....,It was a good mystery- especially if you like stories from the early 1900's era. Don't think it was as good as some of her others but nevertheless it will hold your interest. Read it for yourself.
2,Verbose and slow,"I used to enjoy MRR's books very much, but this one was too cute and the characters hopped on trains and went into town over and over. Try one of her others."
5,All Available Boats!,This @mims Twitter post: 'Moving documentary of 9/11 evacuation by boat shows #resilience of cities[...]reminded me of how humbled and impressed I was after reading how successfuly the evacuation was conducted by literally 'All Hands' who came together and made a difference during this crisis!
4,"Pretty, Ugly or Both?","Who is the better choice for a marriage partner? Is it the intelligent, hard-working, unbecoming but sincere office mate who will give a sympathetic ear to a coworker? Or, is it the gorgeous, charming, sexy, mystery person who seems reluctant to commit to a relationship? Those are the 2 opposites that Barbara Mori portrays in this romantic comedy from Latin America.Mori, an acclaimed actress of Mexican telenovelas, and Marcelo Mazzarello, an accomplished Argentinian actor, give good performances in this light-hearted story that will amuse fans of Spanish-language films. The chemistry between these two talented perfomers is equally palpable in both the ""ugly"" and ravishing personas that Mori portrays.There is a good mix of funny, serious & poignant moments in this delightful romantic comedy set in Chile. If you're a fan of this genre, you'll find this movie entertaining, although not original. Enjoy!"
2,Too poncy...,I bought this book based on the positive reviews. What a disappointment. It comes across as too fussy. If this book had been come out in the early 20th century it would have been more appropriate.
5,The Bible of Men's Style,I've now read several highly recommended books on men's style. This book is the best out of all of them. In my opinion 'Clothes and the Man' is a little better than Flusser's more well-known 'Dressing the Man' (seen stacked in Ralph Lauren stores). 'Clothes and the Man' delves deeper into the subject laying out specific guidelines to build season-specific wardrobes. Unfortunately the book is out of print now...fairly easy to find on the net though!
5,A must have book,"Flusser's Clothes and the Man is a must have for any person serious about menswear, and any man who cares about dressing well. But be warned: if you're looking for a book on fashion, look elsewhere, because this book concerns style, and the two are not the same. Once you read this book, shopping trips will never be the same."
1,Lacking basic information,"This book is seemingly a compilation of dive locations frequented by dive resorts, with little independent research or reviews of specific dive outfitters. The book lacks basic information on water temperatures, currents, winds and seasonal influences. The independent traveller primarily interested in snorkeling will also be disappointed in the lack of practical information on the best sections of the main islands for shoreline snorkeling."
3,Forget Snorkeling Info,"I bought this book primarily because I am going to Fiji in two months and wanted info on snorkeling. Boy was I surprised to find only half a page devoted to snorkeling. The rest of the book is a brief description of various dive sites.The book does have nice pictures and basic information regarding the more popular dive sites in Fiji. But as a snorkeling reference, it is worthless."
4,Dreamy,"Some artists make it difficult for themselves by recording such great work at the beginning of their careers, setting the bar too high for subsequent releases. And yes, ""And She Closed Her Eyes"" is such a marvelous, dreamy, haunting album that I never expected Ms N to release anything so good again. And perhaps ""The World is Saved"" doesn't quite send the same chill down my spine, but it is still bloody good. Surprisingly good in fact. Get On With Your Life, Winter Killing, On Falling, The Morning Belongs to the Night and The End of a Love Affair are stand out tracks. But the others are good too, not a dud one on the album. The same cutesy, whimsical fragile voice which seduced us in And She Closed Her Eyes hasn't lost any of its charm. That voice is accompanied by gentle, delicate atmospheric arrangements and most of these songs wouldn't have been out of place on And She Closed Her Eyes. In fact, this is the album which should have followed And She Closed Her Eyes. Charming and dreamy. Again."
1,This CD is a phantom as the label already states,"I'm sorry, but 'The World is Saved'has never been released yet.Cocnerning the Israelian review, I guess he heard the 'Jean Claude' soundtrack -bootleg, which was never released officially and also has a track called 'the world is saved'. So I think he is mistaken and didnt actually hear the new album at all, in fact nobody did, yet.Check for all latest details her official site:http://www.seekyoudanger.comthanks."
4,Great 2nd book in the trilogy!,Thoroughly enjoyed the suspense and the romance in this book. I loved getting another glimpse of Dallas and Genny. Caleb and Jazzy definitely have chemistry as well. The suspense/mystery was great and kept me guessing until the end!
4,Okay Book,"The econd in a series of books located in Cherokee, TN was okay. It was not quite as good as the first. Caleb and Jazzy's tale started off with likable but rather combustible characters in an interesting situation. I was somewhat disappointed with Caleb at the end. He goes off, leaving the woman he loves, when she is in considerable danger. Even though he swore to stay with her, he did not. He has not been honest with her. It made her very angry as she should have been. He leavces with his rich grandfather instead of staying and protecting her. Jazzy should consider selling out and seeing something of the rest of the world. This particular part of it has not been particularly good for her. The end of the book just sort of petered out with Jazzy appearing to lose some of her confidence in herself. I guess the author is going to tie things up in the final book, but she has to make us want to go there. Right now, I am not sure I do."
4,Symptoms by Isadore Rosenfeld MD,Excellent source of information and guidance. Found it to be very helpful and informational. Recommend to anyone looking for quick reference and clear answers!
3,"good book, wherever it is","I bought it, skimmed through it and then misplaced it. Good book for the price."
5,Great party album and amazing live band!,"wow. I wasn't too exposed to Jane's addiction or Nuno's stuff...so my fairly unbias opinion is that this is a really good party album!The tunes are mostly groovy and definitely grow on you. Admittedly, the thought of Jim Morrison's voice on a song sounded way weird to me, but I love that song! Ton's of other guests too.SP is a great live act also! I am super excited to see them several times over the next three months as they are on tour with a band (that I probably like even more :-X) called MINK. Mink is another electric live band that really is great party music, but with a little more rock edge than SP. Two great bands touring for three months, do yourself a favor and see them (Mink's self titled debut comes out late August, don't miss out).Five stars for satellite party's debut."
3,"Hmmm, just ok.","Yeah, I find it a little funny that Nuno is not mentioned. Afterall, he is the reason I bought this. So coming into this as a Nuno fan I was a little dissapointed. Although, there are some moments that Nuno stands out. There is some good listening here. I think as it was mentioned earlier it kinda grows on you with each listen."
2,Come on...,"There are some good moments, but yeach, its offset by some miserable doss, thinly veiled disco, derrivative hooks (you invented a great sound, Peter, but some new rifs are past -due -mate) You want to disagree - play AWESOME track first... really annoying and tragic misuse of talent and opportunity."
4,begining of something,"i hope this marks the begining of a new avenue for perry ...this sound could provide a rich texture much like janes did for all of us years ago . this a good cd more like 3 1/2 stars but not a 3 . not a waste of money . good house party tracks on here as well as some good stuff to add to your playlist . i would recommend it , great summer music....not angry like janes was ...but that fit the time much like this does..."
2,missing part,"I started with Jane Eyre. The formatting is perfectly acceptable, but it was missing half of chapter 25. I reported it and the publisher claimed it was there. Is it only on my Kindle? I returned it and am trying another version."
5,Excellent Latex Gloves,"If you need Extra-Large latex gloves, these are excellent quality. The one-size-fits-all don't! My husband uses these for gardening and other heavy-duty cleaning chores. They could last for more than one job, but once he takes them off, they can't be easily put on again. These are a bit more expensive than the one-size, but they're worth the price!"
1,"Slick, Cannot Hold On To Things","Microflex MF300XL Powder Free Diamond Grip Latex Gloves Size Extra...Not something I will purchase again. Not something I will purchase again. Not something I will purchase again. Not something I will purchase again.Update: After half a box, I now notice my joints hurt after I remove the gloves. I threw the box away, would never use again."
5,Only glove's fit big hand's,"I am a handy man, I use these for all kinds of work, staining, grease I have big hands fit great!!!!"
5,Venerate the Great Old Lord of Destruction (and Warms Your Toesies!),"Seldom do I have the pleasurable chance to review such an item with dual purposes of venerating the vengeful old god of destruction, Lord Cthulhu, and keeping ones toesies toasty warm. Indeed, this fabulous item has been calculated to generate the negative planar energy Mr. Cthulhu requires, while keeping ones feet (or nether tentacle-pods) warm on even the coldest mornings (or even the stygian blackness of the abyss at the gates of madness). Try them today!"
5,Adulation to the Old Gods,"Like many people, I am a secret member of an ancient and evil cult of worshippers of dark and peckish gods. I stumbled across this effigy of the most famous great old one purely by chance, searching for enough wicker to make a facsimile Edward Woodward for a home design project. I have to say I was delighted with what I received; Brilliantly stitched and manufactured, this combines puppet combines lovability of a children's toy with the all out horror of an alien being bent on the destruction of the universe. Well done Toy Vault, since our hand puppet arrived the children have been noticeably more terrified that the Great Old ones will devour their souls. Five Stars!"
2,Strange is right,"Was Kirk Douglas ever more horribly miscast? The man exuded power, decisiveness and self-confidence. I've never come across a tougher-sounding weakling or less convincing alcoholic in any screen presence. Scott just wasn't very good. Nor was Stanwyck. These were unreal, unlived-in performances. Heflin, on the other hand, in spite of the haphazard direction and poorly managed scene-setting, delivered his lines well, in a relaxed, natural and easy manner. He seemed like a professional actor, who knew his job. The story was very interesting, and kept you going until the end. Some of the lines were quite sharp and even witty. The book must have been a good read, even if it was all quite incredible. I can't say it wasn't entertaining"
3,Satisfying well acted melodrama,"Barbra Stanwyck plays a two timing rich bitch with as many faces as the situation demands. An interesting nature/nurture about causes - was it genetic - is she a bad seed? or was it her evil Aunt that drove her her to murder, duplicity, lying, deceit, jealousy? The aunt is played by the wonderful Dame Judith Anderson - how do we know she's evil? She gives a nice pussy cat the what for with her walking stick, again, and again, and again - where are the animal cruelty people when you need them? The two schmucks Ms Stanwyck does over are played by Daddy's boy Kirk Douglas and kid from the other side of the tracks out to make his way in the world Van Heflin. Message - give money the heave ho, be true to yourself and get a job for a living. An enjoyable flick played to the hilt by all concerned though the coin trick carried out by Van Heflin in many scenes pales somewhat the fifth time around. Method acting al la George Raft?"
3,Senseless but Fun,"Barbara Stanwyck does it again. She elevates a ""potboiler' to the level of Shakespearean melodrama. She's killed once, so one more time can't hurt. Here's a girl that knows what she wants. Those kisses are as hot as Satan's mistress. Sure, I'm a little overwrought, but this script is pure comic book, so why not?Kirk Douglas plays Barbara's weak husband, though how weak can Douglas ever play it? Not too weak with those piercing eyes; Kirk shows star charisma, but the hard guy is more on type for him. Van Heflin knows too much or he could be Barbara's new play toy. Either way, he doesn't know because Lizabeth Scott with the botox lips is too close, behind the hotel door close.The ending and most of the script makes no sense, but the actors had a ball."
3,The title is very strange,"and doesn't match up with the movie.Very much of its time and not many surprises.Kirk Douglas, in his first film, is very good.Very pat ending..the bad guys have to pay, right?"
2,I didn't love this one,"...a dark film with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in-scratch that, I think the sink was tossed in there. Honestly, I thought Stanwyck and Douglas's performances were laughable. Douglas looked like he was just happy to be there and I don't know what Stanwyck's problem was. Van Helfin was okay but it's Lizabeth Scott that stole this one. She was the only character that came close to being believable. The young actors in the begining of the film were great, but the adult versions just fell flat. And this screenplay was nominated for an Oscar? Jeez. Must have been slim pickin's that year. Overall: Skip it."
2,Rating poor-quality Blu-ray,"Unfortunately the Blu-ray released in 2012 isn't very good. Its been scanned from not-great prints from the Library of Congress, and then digitally cleaned up a tiny bit, but the result is not remotely up to the level of, say, recent B&W Blu-ray releases of Casablanca or All About Eve. Apparently Paramount itself owns better prints, so in theory there could someday be a better version than this."
3,"Strange title, good drama","Barbara Stanwyck wasn't everyone's idea of a raving beauty but her roles had leading men all over Hollywood wrapped around her finger. This worthy potboiler features a very skillful debut performance by Kirk Douglas as her emotionally tortured, semi-sympathetic husband. Douglas nicely handled what had to be one of the most difficult, unheroic roles of his long career. The real male lead of 'The Strange Love of Martha Ivey' is a young Van Heflin as a sharp-talking, world-weary loner who drifts back to his hometown to learn what happened to his childhood sweetheart--and a lot has! Somehow this dark, episodic movie seems older than 1946 but it has a lot to offer if you like a good time-capsule melodrama."
3,Kirlian computers enforce the law.,"Historically it's interesting that the ""Kirlian Photography"" fad that gave Van Vogt the idea came to nothing. Here ""Van"" imagines a future where computers can stop crime instantly, but there's something afoot they can't cover... It's a scenario where a few resourceful and inspired Vogtian characters quickly analyse a bizarre situation and take the required bold actions needed to solve the problem. Builds on the portrayal of the power and elegance of (real) rational thinking that was a major theme of Van's."
4,Love the Classics,It's hard to top the classics. George Sanders never fails to dissappoint as the villan and Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr were great.
2,Very Dissapointed,"I am so dissapointed in the quality of this dvd. It is very expensive and the only refund I can get is half. The colors are fuzzy,the audio is not clear in some places and there is one scene where the face of Delilah is not clear,but dirty looking because the smoke in the scene is too dark. I remember a movie with beautiful color and sound and music. I am just sick I wasted my money. Sorry for the bad review,but this is the truth."
1,"Great movie, lousy print","One of the great classics. Unfortunately, this import print is horrible. Washed out colors. You need to be really desperate to own this one."
5,One of the best of the golden oldies,I have loved this film since I first saw it. It was release the year before I was Born. Hedi Lamar was a gorgeous woman I am not sure why she wasn't as well known simply for her looks. It is truely an epic example of Hollywood movie making in the golden age. If you haven't seen it you have really missed one of the great ones.
2,why hasn't this great film been released,"This two star is not for the movie but for the poor import dvds it has been released on. Why hasn't this wonderful film been released by Hollywood??? It has everything needed for a DVD or even a BLURAY. Paramount Studios, Cecil B DeMille, Technicolor, Victor Mature, Hedy Lamar, one of Paramounts biggest moneymakers ever????? Why no release? Does anybody know? Can we contact Paramount to at least find out??"
3,samson and delilah 1949 version,I can say that im not disappointed with my purchase of samson and delilah (victor mature) the color was not sharpe as it should be it looked like it was copied from vhs tape. i was just happy to see this old bible story classic again someone in hollywood need to put samson and delilah back on dvd in the remastered form that it should be in. goodbuzz is were i ordered it from im happy with the dvd of the movie and i would order from them again i gave this item 3 star rateing. it would be great if hollywood stepped in on this bible classic. im waiting for a remastered dvd version of samson and delilah (victor mature) 1949 version.
5,Simply wonderful!,"When I saw this film was available I had to purchase it. This is an ""old school"" favorite, and my dvd arrived extremely fast, and was in great condition. You cannot find DVD's of this quality and category on sale in many stores these days. That is why this is such an awesome service! The DVD played perfectly with no problems at all. I completely enjoyed viewing this film. It is a great addition to my growing collection!THANK YOU!!!!!!!!"
1,Awful print,"This review is for the Chinese/Taiwan/Hong Kong import. One of the worse print I've seen. The colors are washed out. Blurry picture, pixelated and freezes thruout the movie. Wish Hollywood would remaster this great classic. Unless you're desperate to see this movie no matter what, I say wait to get the real thing, or you'll be disappointed as I am."
4,Very nice Fostner bit,"Freud, as always, has made another nice product. Only 4 stars because, well, there is probably something nicer out there although I don't know what. Bit is wonderfully well machined and works great. I wish my drill press would go a little slower as I am really (at 700 rpm) turning it a bit fast. Wish all my bits were this nice."
2,It doesn't make the size,"It cut fast and neat, but it doesn't make the hole the size it says it does. I'm really disapointed on the product."
5,Excellent Entertainment Piece,"I have this slate cheese board and bought 2 for friends as presents. They absolutely love them. Every time I use mine, I get compliments on it. Would definitely recommend this item."
5,Great entertaining addition,"This is a great addition to anyone who has friends over and enjoys cheese. It is large enough to hold several cheeses and a fruit garnish. It looks very stylish and fits with any decor. To prevent damage to a table or counter the manufacture has added a felt backing, very helpful and easy to clean, just not in the dishwasher."
3,Awaiting my replacement... arrived with a chipped corner.,"Like many others reviewers, mine arrived with a corner chipped off. It was a Christmas gift and I hope to receive a replacement sooner than later! The board itself looked really nice other than the broken corner."
2,shocked,"dear sir, i was shocked to come to know today that the item was reconditioned.because the info on site where i bought the item was given as new. you owe me an explanation. please clarify."
4,Cooooooooool!,"This film is just great. It's a bout the evil dr. Ganggren who is trying to brian wash people through his talk show, his evil plan is helped by the evil docters killer tomatoes. It is up to a tomatoeologeist and a cop (a dirty harry spoof) to stop the sinister plan. This is a great film, it has lots of great laughs and is just plane entertaining till the end. The one problem is that if the show situation happened I wouldn't watch the show, cause it seems realy boring. Just don't expect anouther [show] and you'll be fine."
3,A stupid sequel...,"Following the infamous Tomatoes Attacks movies, this one is a comedy like Top Secret and Airplane. Well saying, it tries to be, 'cause it's much inferior than that, the jokes are extremely stupid. Even so, it has some good gags, like the English-Tomatoe dictionary..."
1,Too high priced for a paperback,I've played EQ since day one and had planned to buy every piece of fiction written about the world of Norrath that brought the lore of the planet alive. I've rated this book a one solely on the basis of the publishers cheap marketing ploy to soak the Everquest community by charging us hardback prices for cheap paperbacks. $24 bucks list price for a paperback? Start taking the EQ communty seriously and give us the lore in hardback form as they did for The Rogue's Hour. I'll hang onto my money until you do.
5,NY Yankees Classic Polo Shirt,Purchased as gift for father-in-law who is a die-hard fan. Great product!
2,Just another book in a sea of many,"I originally thought that this book would do a better job of addressing the needs of Internet entrepreneurs (emphasis on the word ""Internet""), but it's just another book on business plan writing; the only difference is that "".com"" has been added to boost sales. As a business planning book, it's not that it's a bad book, per se, it's just not an extraordinary one.For starters, it's not 240 pages, as advertised; it's only 190. And of that 190, almost a third is the same list of resources and references that every other book provides. Does the entrepreneur really need to be told ad nauseam that the SBA is a good source of information? And I was really shocked to see that addressing the technology related to running an Internet business was covered in less than one full page.The bottom line is that if you don't already own a business plan book, this is as good as any other. If you already have such a book, save yourself [the money] and skip this one."
2,Outdated and very limited,"This was written at the height of the internet bubble and does very little to help one figure out the specifics that need to be in a business plan, especially in the current market. This is very generalized and is geared towards 2 types of simple mom and pop type internet businesses. I realize one book cannot cover all of the possibilities but this book hardly deserves the subtitle ""Everything You Need to Know..."""
4,Glad to see they cut out the rap!,"Papa Roach's major label debut was a good album for its time:99-00. Back when TRL played bands like limp bizkit, korn, incubus and P.O.D.Papa Roach got tons of airplay for the Last Resort and Broken Home Videos. But, that was then, this is now. Rap Rock is dead.This album really shows Coby's voice. He's a pretty talented singer actually. There is hardly any rap on this record(always a good sign) The only rapping is on the bridge in ""She loves me not""but hey, it's the first single. They have to.All in all better than Infest.I also heard that Limp Bizkit's new album cut out the rap. Let's all hope."
5,Things have changed....,"It started with ""Infest"" and as a fan of Papa Roach I must say their second lyrical installment is by far an improvement not to say that ""Infest"" [was bad], but Lovehatetragedy has up'd the bar. M-80, the only lousy track on the album, is hard to understand but hey, no one is perfect. This Cd then rox its way through twelve kick[ing] trax that leave you thirsting for more."
4,"great cd, but not like infest","This cd is still pretty good but I think it lacks the energy and edge infest had. Some of the songs are a little soft and I can't listen to it all the way through like i could with Infest. This cd is still very good but it's not quite what I was expecting. Songs 6, 7, and 8 are the best"
3,Might Work For Some But Don't Expect A Classic,"I give Papa Roach credit for the first album, Infest, but Lovehatetragedy, not only has a very long title (and odd titles on some songs aswell), but it seemed very rushed, even its singles were rushed. Decompression Period was good, Jacoby had great vocals on that song. But some songs sound too much alike, vocals sound rushed, the tunes sound rushed, and even the seconds in between songs seemed rushed. Overall it is a good album, but don't expect too much with it, just expect good music that is good to listen to every now and then."
5,The other style of Papa Roach,"Following their first release ""Infest"" in 2000, produced by Dreamworks Records. They released their second cd LoveHateTragedy in June 2002, also produced by Dreamworks Records.THis CD is awesome! It displays P-Roachs more mellow sound and feelings more openly on this CD. There's more melodic tunes, if you have ""Infest"", you would find this CD very different from it. There isn't much rapping, other than in the hit song ""She Loves Me Not"". Their first song on this album ""M-80 Explosive Energy Movement"", contains a really punky tune and really fast guitar playing, it still displays some power packed in their first album ""Infest"".In my opinion, ""Time and Time Again"" ""She Loves Me Not"" and ""Life Is A Bullet"" are the best songs on the cd.So, what are you waiting for? Go for it now!"
3,omg!! not at all what I expected,"I really loved Infest. I don't like this CD. It's repetative, more of the same, and very slow. I do, however, like some of the lyrics, she loves me not, and most of the riffs. All I have to say, is get some new material."
3,Maybe 3.5 for their 2nd Major label album,"A little over 2 years since their major label debut, and their best album(of the 3 of their's I own) the Northern cali band is back with my least favorite of the 3 of theirs I own. For starters I like rap and some oldies/Motown more then rap-metal and alternative but I do like some of that but I still think this is an average album. With 13 songs, 5 are good, 8 are ok, none are bad or great. It starts off average, gets good in the middle, and the end return to average. A lot less harder and more songs then the upbeat rap style they used on ""Infest"", which I personally liked. A nice album for their fans but I'm indifferent on if you should add it to your collection or not.#1 - 7.5#2 - 7.5#3 - 7.5#4 - 8#5 - 6#6 - 7.5#7 - 8.5#8 - 8#9 - 8#10 - 8.5#11 - 7.5#12 - 6.5#13 - 7"
3,Good.. not great.. but quite good...,"I just recently listened to this album again after it sat on my shelves for about 2 years. And where I thought it was haunted by a 'sophomore jinx' in that it wasn't a strong disc I have to take that back. This disc is actually really great. There is some terrific guitar work on it. It's not one of my all-time favorite CDs but it's definitely ownable. The single ""She Loves Me Not"" is actually probably the weakest track on the CD. The rest of the disc is *far* stronger and heavier than that tune. The mix is a little 'muddy' in a couple of spots (the cymbals are a bit muffled and could be more crisp sounding) but over all it's a great experience."
2,I liked Infested better than this.,"I didn't particularly care for this album to much. Papa Roach's last album, Infested, was a lot better in my opinion. Lovehatetragedy was boring and not as interesting as I thought it would be. Papa Roach kind of stinks. Every song on this album sounds just about the same and I don't like it. Sorry. I prefer Infested over this one any day."
2,Papa Roach - Lovehatetragedy,"Papa Roach, what can I say? MTV icons, masters of TRL, anything they do will go gold, at the very least, whether they deserve it or not. In the case of Lovehatetragedy it is defiantly a not. Sorry ""Jacoby Shadix"" but this one doesn't make the grade as far as depth. Lovehatetragedy seems to be a very pop-centered album made to attract the 14 year-old girl audience. The rap element is more prominent, and that coupled with, I'll admit, very catchy choruses round out the album. Overall, this CD is too short (time-wise), over priced, and seriously lacks the energy in that of infest; after all the hype, I was very disappointed to find out what I had paid for. Up the vocal levels, get back to what you know, and maybe you'll get the fans back you had for Infest.htp://codeblue.is.dreaming.org"
1,sigh,"the fact is, jacoby cant sing well and the songs are very weak, lacking ear-catching hooks. And the terrible production doesnt help either. They need to go back to their trademark rap-rock style song writing. This album IS A TRAGEDY!"
3,moving in the right direction...,"with the members of papa roach moving toward a sound that contains more honest to god rock than it does rap infested nu-metal(i cringe at the term),this album and the band might just get somewhere. you can't not love the cover, and the music's not too bad, either..."
2,The sophmore jinx?,"To put it simply, this cd is not very good. Every song except the made for radio she loves me not, sounds exactly the same, with no distinct chorus. I was very disappointed in this cd, but at least I can tolerate the one song."
4,Great CD,When I first got this cd I was thinking I would be dissapointed because I thought Papa Roach might not be able to pull of another good cd. But I was wrong right when I put it in. The first time threw it was ok but every time after that it just keeps getting better. It you in anyway liked Infest the buy this cd because you wont be let down.
1,Rocker please.,"The rock/metal arena in the States is getting stale. Bands like this spwan like cockroaches, looking for the same institutionalized white boys as food. Old Jane's Addiction or Skid Row's Slave To The Grind can blow away these players and kids so easily, if they have heard them before."
1,"No, I can't take it...","Believe it or not, I didn't think Papa Roach's major label debut ""Infest"" was half bad, but ""Lovehatetragedy"" is nothing but the same 'ol uninspired, repetitive, untalented, downtuned guitars, and lame lyrics that we're so used to by now with the nu-metal scene. ""Infest"" at least had a hint (and a small one at that) of personality that nearly seperated Papa Roach from the rest of the crowd, but this absolutely kills anything good they had. What is sure to be a commercial hit, I find ""Lovehatetragedy"" best used as a drink coaster."
1,DON'T BUY,"Bought it rite after infest, and my god this is their worse. Buy gettting away with murder or the paramour sessions...this cd is awful except she loves me not. a few others are OK but thats it. don't bother-download thembye"
1,"As far as nu-metal standards go, lame","Nu-metal isn't my favorite type of metal, but there are some bands that are actually good. Papa Roach isn't one of them. The lyrics are unoriginal, the vocals suck, the guitar is one basic riff played over and over and over again, the bass...WHAT??!?!!!?!? YOU MEAN PAPA ROACH HAS A BASSIST??!!!!? And lastly the drumming is simple. You should avoid any Papa Roach album except Getting Away With Murder. It has a few good songs. For good music listen to the following bands:NU-METAL: Scum Of The Earth, Rob Zombie, KoRn, Slipknot, Coal Chamber, Soil, American Head Charge, Powerman 5000, MotoGrateRMETAL: Anthrax, Sepultura, Malevolent Creation, Cannibal Corpse, Testament, Monstrosity, Venom, Six Feet Under, In Flames, ImmortalJust boycott this album and buy GAWM used."
2,Blaaaahhh....,"While I actually enjoyed their debut album (I'd probably give it a 3), the minute I heard 'She Loves Me Not', I knew that these guys had gone downhill. While the guitar riff might be semi-intricate (well, not really), the uninventive lyrics, more rapping, and the 'trying to show everyone we're still heavy metal' scream at the end of the song. Well, I gave them a chance, and listened to the CD at a local shop. It's just more of the same people. I had some hope for them, but I guess this album just isn't my thing. I will not say they sold out, or that this album [is bad], it's just in my opinion, PR could've done, and should've done better."
2,Not as good as any of the other Papa Roach albums,"Not a bad album but not near as good as any of the others by Papa Roach. If you ever get the chance to see them in concert they are incredible, I highly recommend them in concert!"
5,"Thank you, Papa Roach.","lovehatetragedy is completely amazing! For me, the dynamic guitar work really stands out in this album. It feels like it takes each song by the hair and throws them against a wall. It's just pure, fierce power. born with nothing, die with everything is my favorite. The melodies are mysterious and entrancing. Jacoby is brilliant as always on vocals and the lyrics are thought-provoking. Papa Roach just keeps getting more and more awesome."
1,Disappointing,"A long awaited album for Papa Roach fans being one my self, I am very sorely disappointed.This album is lacking in orginality and all the songs are pretty much the same. If you are intrested in Papa Roach, a much safer bet would to buy the first album ""Infest"" which is a success in Rock Music. To all you Roach fans I would suggest leaving this album and wait to see what else the band attempt."
5,The New Papa Roach Album,"Papa Roach has rocked out loud for the 2nd time! It is the best rock album this year! It has lots of new tracks including the hit She Loves Me Not. Instead of Jacoby rappin' all the time, he is singin' straight melodies! Try songs M-80(Explosive Energy Movement, Singular Indestructable Droid, Life is a Bullet and Born With Nothing,Die With Every Thing!"
4,Not bad... I expected more though!,"I had high expectations for this CD, they were somewhat fulfilled, but it sounded too much like Drowning Pool. Another CD that I didn't enjoy much like this was Slipknot's ""IOWA"". That album...! I hated it! I sold it and got $8 for it! But anyway, we're talking about ""lovehatetragedy"", which pretty much describes my feelings for this CD! I don't exactly love it, I don't hate it, but I feel like Papa Roach has become a tragedy! What happened to the hardcore-ness of ""Infest"". It is missing here. Plus, are there any songs that they play on the radio from this CD. That was the problem with ""Iowa"", no songs were played before the release to highten excitement. But hey, this is a great CD. I liked it, but why couldn't it have been crazier! Oh well, for people who are desperate and need something hard and heavy (you don't exactly have to like Papa Roach to enjoy this CD) get this album!"
4,"Not Impressed, Not Disappointed","This CD isn't as good as Infest. I didn't expect it to be. Infest was a wonderful CD. I loved it, and I still do. Nothing beats ""Snakes"" or ""Between Angels and Insects,"" not to mention the rest of the songs. However, this CD is still worth owning, and defenitely pretty cool. Which was exactly what I expected. The truth is, this CD is just a slightly less cool version of Infest. The songs sound about the same, but a little more melodic. There are some great songs like ""Life is a Bullet"" and ""Born with Nothing, Die with Everything."" Even though this is nothing really new, Coby (Jacoby now) still sings more melodically than the 20,000 other metal singers, and the lyrics are pretty good. This CD is for Roach fans. For new listeners, get Infest first, and if you like that, get this. It's not perfect, but its worth owning.Closing comments:Youve got to love the cover. The video for ""She Loves Me Not"" is pretty cool."
5,And who said sequels suck?,"After getting huge radio airplay and mtv airplay with ""Last Resort"" Papa Roach returns with a much more mature album which explodes right from the start with M80 and keeps it up through the whole album. Those who said Infest wasn't a complete album and had too much filler will find nothing to complain about here. The artist formaly known as Coby Dick has matured to a different level here and leaves behind the raprock genre to find his own voice and it is a great one. Check these guys out on Anger Management 2.0 and check the website...to hear some samples. This is a must for any fan of Papa Roach."
2,weakkkkkkkk,they've gone soft. at least i think. the songs arent hard enuff......she loves me not? come on now think of some better lyrics than that. still depressing and they still put in a bad mood. good job papa roach. cant wait 2 hear the next album....ah we can only wait.......
2,"READ ONCE, THEN DIVORCE YOURSELF","A volume of (mostly)amusing quotes and engaging nuggets about hubbys and wives, guys and gals ... dating and mating, sexing, marrying, honeymooning and divorcing. You've read them all before (the quotes have been lifted from other books and published interviews, and many taken out of context), so think twice before saying ""I do"" when the sales clerk asks, ""Do you really want to buy this?"""
4,"Unusual music, but very complex","Rudess's new solo album has a certain quirkiness, but delivers a large progression of music. Some songs are soft rock, some are more prog metal, while some even are really jazzy. The drumming and keyboards are excellent. However, I thought Rudess should have kept this album totally instrumental. The two tracks with singing are a bit weaker than the other songs. Besides that, I really liked the songs ""Insectamongus,"" ""Ra,"" and ""Barhopping with Mr. Picky."" Rudess may have been a little rushed when producing this CD, which could have hindered its potential to be better. If you're a huge Jordan Rudess fan or love Derek Sherinian's work with Planet X and would love to hear a CD that's practically all keyboard work, I highly recommend this album. Otherwise, if you're just a Dream Theater fan, you may dislike some of the songs."
4,State of the art virtuosity,"On Rhythm of Time, Jordan Rudess collaborates with some of the more accomplished guitarists working; Steve Morse, Greg Howe, Vinnie Moore, and Joe Satriani. There is technique galore on this CD. Rudess is a keyboardist of stunning technique and astonishing musical breadth and depth. Rhythm of Time contains the expected elements: tricky time signatures, complex arrangements, and high level virtuosity. What separates this CD from many other chops-fests is Rudess' overall musical sense. Despite the often monstrous displays of pure virtuosity on songs like Time Crunch and Screaming Head, the music never degenerates into a display of technical excercises, the musical integrity is always maintained. Rudess uses his fluency with different kinds of music to create a new kind of 21st century fusion. In addition, any chance to hear Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, and Greg Howe is always welcomed."
4,Great album,"Great album, I enjoyed it. Lot of different layers to listen to, and it takes a few cycles through before you catch all of it."
4,Very complex,"this album is very good to expand your muscial skills and thinking and feeling in terms of time and scales. On the homepage of rudess, you will find an online magazine, which talks sometimes about one or two songs on this cd, even with transcription!For me, the grooviest one is track #5 for which I don't actually get the rhythm. It's something like 15/16 or 5/8, 6/8, 4/8 but there is missing on 16th note. Try to jam along - it's not so easy! Who cracks this nutshell?Because of this, I think the album is too complex for many people and also too nervous..."
4,He could've done better though =/,"I can't deny his skills for being a complete virtuoso with the keyboards but...sometimes his stuff gets a little repetitive after a bit. His solo project ""feed the wheel"" was 70 minutes with crazy variations of songs.On his latest album lots of it is literally ""crunching"" type of sounds...I think he could've done better especially since he picked up guitar god/legends Joe Satriani with his funky riffs and cool solo lines and Steve Morse with his...well his godly guitar solos/contribution...blah...Oh well"
2,a big let down,"im not sure why most people like this cd. to me it sounded like some kid messing around with his dads keyboard. the music seems unscripted and does not flow. maybe its just to weird or ""out there"" for me."
1,Sucks,This sounds like background music to a soft drink commercial directed towards teens who are interested in extreme sports.
3,Asi-Asi,"I gave Mrs. Brown 3 stars for trying though the plot did drag. However I've read some pretty bad books and this was, by far, NOT the worst. I did not like the book myself, but hey, don't take my word for it. Try it yourself!"
1,Would rather watch paint dry,"After completing construction on a luxury resort on Parrish Island, engineer Scout Ritland is ready for a break - and he finds just the person to spend some time with at a party, sexy French siren Chantal DuPont. When he finds himself waking in a strange place kidnapped with a gunshot wound, he's a little angry. Chantal explains that the reason he is needed is to help her tropical village build a bridge, and he reluctantly helps out the locals. Of course the two engage in hot jungle love before proclaiming their undying devotion to each other.This book was a real chore to finish. In fact, if this was my fist SB book, it would also be the last. Poor writing, lame dialog, and a generally uninteresting plot make this a pretty poor entry in Brown's list of hits. I find it hard to believe that she would allow it to be re-released and just proves that you can publish anything with the right name attached to it.When will I learn not to read Brown's ""classic"" romances?"
1,Disappointing,I have read almost all of Sandra Brown's books and have enjoyed just about all of them. This was by far the least entertaining. I actually disliked the heroine of this book.
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"This is such a big disappointment after all of her other books. I usually can't wait to read a new Sandra Brown book, but this time I could hardly finish it because it was so boring. Sandra Brown can do better than this."
2,Stupid Stupid Stupid,"What was Ms. Brown thinking? This was one of the stupidest books I've read! (well, I gave it two stars, so there are worse books out there to read) I don't recommend it. Ms. Brown writes MUCH MUCH better than this!"
5,Accept No Substitutes,"Many years ago, for about eight bucks more than this bit cost, I bought a complete set of Fortsner bits in a nice wooden case. When the time came to actually use them, they were quite handy for determining the exact size I needed. Nothing else. Except for woodburning, they are essentially useless. It amazes me how they can produce a piece that looks exactly like the real thing, and then make their money by failing to put a worthy cutting edge on it.This was before I truly learned about inexpensive imported cutting tools. When I had some serious paying work that required a few accurate borigns, I unhesitatingly bought Freud- while not a woodworker geek's ultimate high end, they are easy to find in big-box stores, and as I have learned, nothing cuts like a Freud."
1,Methinks he doth protest to much,This book could have been a tender and healing accounting the changes which aging brings to relationships. It could have been a thoughtful discussion of the practical aspects of nursing home decisions. However Taylor clearly considered it all an inconvenience and a hassle. I suspect he wrote the book as therapy. The woodblock prints were the best part.
3,Not quite sure where this was going...,"If the writer of this movie had a story to tell or a point to make, it got lost or distorted in the mix. There appears to be no clear purpose for the story needing to be told. The one stand-out was the actress who plays Raven, though she appears far too late in the movie. This is a good movie for people who like to say ""what the?"" as the credits begin to roll."
5,Master Songwriter !!!,"Rodney Crowell should be spoken of in the same breath as Bob Dylan & John Lennon, Leonard Cohen & Tom Rapp, Joe Ely & Ray Wylie Hubbard, Eric Andersen, Townes Van Zandt, Jackson Browne, John Stewart & Guy Clark, Van Dyke Parks & Phil Ochs or anyone else you'd like to insert in this long list of gifted & brilliant songwriters. Why he isn't is a true mystery. My God the talent this artist is !!! Run don't walk to your nearest music store & buy this CD to begin with & then get everything else."
2,Got two different hinges.,"Ordered this based on the picture, seeing that it appeared to match up perfectly with the Amerock hinge that I was trying to replace. Pulled one hinge out and tried on cabinet door. It matched up with the previously drilled holes with plastic inserts. However, the overlay did not match up perfectly with the other hinge on the door that was not broken (unable to adjust it to match). So I decided to just change out both hinges, but when I pulled out the second hinge the holes were towards the back of the hinge instead of being towards the front of the hinge like on the first one. One package, two different hinges! So now I will be ordering again, hoping that I get at least one hinge that looks like the picture!"
1,No qc at this company,Had to order two sets of hinges to get a complete set. Had two different hinges in each package. I guess that QC person had a rough night before he came to work that day!
5,The hard to find replacement I needed.,"After several wasted trips to my local stores, I found the exact repacement I needed here. I wanted the holes to line up from my previous broken hinge so I wouldn't have to drill more in my cabinet. As a bonus, two hinges came in the package."
1,Lounge gown,"The item is too short for me. I like my gowns longer. I am only 5ft.9inches, so I am not overly tall. Also, it is rough on my skin and needs ironing, which I am not really happy with. In other words, for the cost of it and the quality of it, I am very disappointed! Ruby Collins"
1,I hate it,This was not what I expected. It is not soft material and the neck is too high. I feel like I'm choking. I'll never wear it. It does seem to be pretty sturdy however.
2,Not Impressed,I am relatively new to the advertising field and was anxious to receive this book to broaden my knowledge. Even as a novice I found the information to be most basic and without much substance. Fortunately I purchased several college textbooks and found what it was I sought when I purchased this book. If you desire to use this book as a way of gaining true insight into media planning there are much better choices available to you.
2,Thoroughly mediocre,"As a regional media strategist with 25 years experience, I found this book useless when synthesizing practical experience to teaching at the University level. It's not organized well, and it's too brief to fully give the student proper knowledge of this field. At this point, it's also outdated."
3,"Get the book, not the CD!","I bought this CD for my hubby, who has decided to get back into meditation. He also bought the book, which is wonderful and highly recommended.The CD? Not so much recommended. For one thing, Victor has a speaking voice that is a bit grating for a guided meditation CD. I have nothing against NY accents but a more soothing, lilting voice is definitely preferred if one is leading a guided meditation.A better meditation CD would be Rod Stryker's ""3 Meditations to Live By"" (this is one I swear by). Rod's voice is much more soothing.Another issue with this CD is that during the actual meditation, Victor will pop up and start talking at the most inopportune times, startling you out of your meditative flow.Get the book instead, which hubby says has completely changed the way he looks at meditation (for the better)."
2,A brief collection of commonly known old facts,"This book was a quick read and was disappointing. It claims to enlighten the reader to the world behind the scenes of the amusement industry and carnivals but in reality it is nothing more than a few well known facts compiled into different chapters. It is very shallow and although I did get a couple of laughs out of it, it does not delve deeply enough into the subject matter to reveal anything ""secret"" or previously unknown. Having worked in a similar industry for over a decade I know there is much more going on behind the scenes.But you wont read about it here."
4,A good introduction,"The use of stock footage from the era gives the viewer a ""feel"" for the times. Mr. Gilbert's visits to some of the locations in which fighting took place was also interesting and I hope to visit some of these spots myself before I return to the United States."
1,Okay - But -,"I suppose you're reviewing this and considering buying something that'll give you some worthwhile history. Well, here's the ""bottom line"" - pass on this one and get a copy of ""Israel - A Nation Is Born"", which is narrated by Abba Eban - ""A Personal Witness"". Take my word on it, that DVD stands head and shoulders above this one!"
4,Good Stuff,It doesn't have as much functionality or user friendliness as an iPod but it's battery life more than makes up for it.
2,Sony Network Walkman Disappoints,"I believe this MP3 player is above average in terms of features and capabilities. However, its two main weaknesses are the horrible software that is needed to install on the PC for the music transfer (you have no choice but to use that program), and the screen which is not as legible as the Ipods. As a result, I cannot really give this unit a positive recommendation until these two issues are addressed."
3,Volume too low,"This is a really nice unit. Handsome, small, easy to use.. but.. the power cord must be plugged in behind a very flimsy door on top of the unit (use primarily in the car, plugged in) and when connecting it to the car stereo the volume was half of what my previous Archos XS200 was doing..... Went back to the Archos and returned the SONY"
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent product.It is built sturdy and does everything that I ask of it.Many have complained about the software, I downloaded the most recent version imported all of my 3000 mp3 and then ripped about 100 cds.It imported well, converted well, played everything I put on and even was pretty easy to pick up the free songs that came with the unit.I have used this as background music at several church functions, just used a patch cord and pluged into the building's speaker system, put the unit on audio out and people were indeed impressed.I am looking to purchase 2 more for my girls."
2,bye bye Sony,"It is very user unfriendly thingy. You have to use the Sonic Stage that comes with it. I bought it in 2004 to avoid iPod. I put up with it for a while. The player itself is fine. Very flat and sleeky, stylish looking. Only the software is stupid.The audio out jack stopped working in 2007. so no more music for me. It cost me a lot of money when I bought it in Europe.Now I went iPod. Great accessorizing opportunities unlike Sony. iPod works great with many car audio. Alpine that I have let me press menu of the iPod on the reciever. iPod stays in the Glove box. Nothing like that happens with Sony Walkman (not that I know of).Byt he way, I now use it as an external hard drive. :-)"
5,Absolutely Love This!,"Sound Quality is great, despite other reviews I have read the Sonic software works great also. My children have I pods but I reccomend this over the Ipod, much easier to use. The gapless transfer is great for us that love live recordings. Works easily with your stereo or car system. This is breakthrough tecnology, I love it!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Sony NWHD5 great player,"Got this player in early December and thus far it has exceeded my expectations. Enough has been said in other reviews about the negative aspects of the software, so I will stick to the player itself. The sound is very good for a portable player. I really like the push button navigation on the Sony vs. the flywheel found on other devices. Hey, call me old fashion, but I just find pushing the buttons easier. The battery life on this player is just awsome. The fact that the battery is removeable is a major plus. The only negative that I can find, and it is not a major one, is that the volume on the MP3 player must be turned up to the maximum when connected to external speakers such as home stereo or in the car."
1,Horrible overpriced player,Only someone who is from another planet would buy this player. It has problems playing MP3 and WMA files. It forces you to use the dumb Sony software. It costs more than an IPOD.. In short.. buy something else. Sony get your act together.. You invented this category and now you have lost it
4,good ol' sony,"this is an outstanding player. the sound quality is best rated [...] and the removable batter that has a rated life of 40 hours!!!! and a feature that no other player has, is that the screen is bi-directional. what does that mean?well you know how some platers are held in the upright position (like the ipod) and some are held horazontally (like the rio fordge) well, this player does both! a very nice feature.also the buttens are all tact-tile, meaning that you actually pres down to move the curser, (unlike the ipods touch wheel) some people like this, some people dont, i do. it is very handy and the buttens dont accidently get pressed. i took of 1 star on this review because of the price, 280 american for a black and white mp3 player! heck, now you can get the 20 gb ipod photo for 30 bucks less! so the price does bring it down a notch.but if you have the money, and arent looking for a color screen. then this is the best SOUND QUALITY player you can buy."
2,Lacks detail.,"This book is supposed to be for beginners, however, it barely touches on the basics (a mere 20 pages). It does contain a 100 pages of examples of textures, but the instructions are practically non-existant. It does give you a list of colors used to achieve the look, but the book does not explain why these colors are used. This makes it difficult to adapt the instuctions to work for a different color flower, for example.A MUCH better book is ""Colored Pencil Solution Book"". I bought both, and the ""Solution"" book has a very extensive explanation of techniques and how colors work (Such as, when applying a color from the opposite side of the color wheel on top of another, it will neutralize the bottom one, making it grayer and more muted. Layering green on top of red, for example).Colored Pencil Solution Book"
3,Unmet potential,"As is the case with most Torchlight films, this movie fails to meet potential. You pretty much should know by now what you're getting: $100 budgets, single-source lighting, 70-minute run times, shoe-string plots, players who cannot act, awful dialog, wall-to-wall sex. So that's this movie in a nutshell. Where it fails to deliver is in explicitness. A couple of the sex scenes were OK, and others were bad. None was good. The nudity was ho-hum and, infuriating as this always is, we hardly ever get to see the actresses naked from behind. Laurie Wallace has a bang-up bum and we see hers for a total of about a second, if you put three different shots together. Nothing at all of the other actresses.So, it could have been better--probably not the best Torchlight release, definitely not the worst. Average from this studio. Not recommended."
4,Very Hot !!,if u like lesbians and cover story thats it ilike this movie soo mush very nice ladies ......
2,I expected some humour,more along the lines of Topper. But it was really sort of depressing. The characters learn things about their lives they would never have known otherwise. Can't say that worth watching though.
5,Where anger comes from and what to do about it,"A clear, simple, compelling, true story that will lead a thinking Christian reader to challenging conclusions about where the anger comes from in his or her life.I don't want to spoil the story--the conclusion follows so naturally in the story line. However, I would heartily recommend this book for any Christian struggling with anger. Once I had read a borrowed copy, I chased down a used copy."
2,Could've been a contender,"There is a riveting book to be written about the odd, multi-faceted triangle shared by Woolworth heir Jimmy Donahue and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Unfortunately, this book only skims the surface. Rarely do any of the players come to life. More examples of Donahue's supposed wit and cavalier charm, in lieu of his often grotesque pranks, would be welcome. The writing is prosaic and plodding. I often had the feeling the author was writing under the gun of an impending deadline -- there is a rushed quality to much of the book. Still, worth reading if you're fascinated, as I am, about the Windsors, a fascinating era, and great wealth and opportunity squandered."
1,"I'd had hopes, but...","This book doesn't do much more than re-hash rumor, gossip and innuendo--and some facts--that I've already read in better-written, more thorough and scholarly biographies of the Windsors. I didn't notice any glaring inaccuracies; on the other hand, I didn't notice that the author broke any new ground. He seems to have relied heavily on previously published biographies of the Duke, the Duchess, and the British Royal Family in general, all of which a serious Windsorite will have already read. Also--let's face it--we read books like this one to be titillated, and the author fails utterly to titillate us. Save your money."
1,"Juicy subject, Pedestrian treatment","You'd think an author couldn't go wrong with this cast of characters, ultra chic jet set locations, and deliciously lewd sex play. But Christopher Wilson took all this potential and and threw it away with the writing style of a schoolboy whose book report was carelessly dashed off before class. Repetitive adjectives, lackluster prose, and unintelligible chapter beginnings and ends - I was hollering for the editor the entire read. I kept saying aloud ""OK, that's a start, but now let's unearth some real dish, and show me the proof!"" Gossip CAN be transformed into history with proper scholarship. This promising biography of three fascinatingly spoiled and twisted people disappointed me."
5,Best thing I've ever tried!!!,Have tried lots of soaps in my 50 years and would not use anything else!
3,PRICE INCREASE NO GOOD,I've been using this soap for years. I have always ordered it thru Amazon but the price has now gone thru the roof. Sorry guys....I'm done with it.
1,Bad fragrance,This soap is mild like it was advertized but it's light fragrance is so bad that I am going to throw it away. I have never before been told that I don't smell very good until I bathed with this soap. JLA
2,"Canus Goat: A Stingy, Smelly soap","I recently received this soap today. I was like ""Wow, this Canus soap smells good! I don't know what other reviewers are complaining about"". The soap smelled pretty okay inside the box, BUT.... when I lathered it up to wash my face, the smell seemed to change and it wasn't ideally pleasant. Also, this particular soap left my face feeling tight and somewhat stingy. Canus needs to really upgrade their product to have a much better fragrance that is rich and long-lasting with better moisturizers---put more goat's milk in it! Do something that's a lot better than this!"
4,Scent is strong for my sensitive nose,"I've used the Canus Goat's Milk Bar Soap in the unscented version and really liked the long lasting, not over-sudsy bar that was quite solid in the hand. I recently purchased a few bars of the original scented version and I personally find it to be a strong scent. My bathroom smells like the soap and the closet smells like the remaining unopened boxes of soap. Although I would give the unscented option 5 stars, the description led me to believe that this would be a very benign scent and it's not. I would describe it as a healthy smelling soap as opposed to an artificial or flowery scent, so it's received a full 4 stars from me."
1,Good price / Poor quality,"The product was priced right but the quality of the product was extremely sub-standard. Not only did the product not last as long as the OEM pads, the setting on the stimulator had to be set at an extremely high reading to get the proper results, thus reducing the battery life to less than half when using the OEM pads."
3,"So- so, works but won't last long",This product doesn't last long in hot and humid environments. The adhesive starts to look like it is melting and it gets pretty messy.
1,THESE ARE TERRIBLE,"These pads retain stickiness for one or two uses and that's about it. In addition, the gel sticky surface comes off on your fingers when you try to put them on! These are the WORST brand I have ever used and do NOT recommend wasting your money!!"
1,Missing the elephant in the living room,"Rampage misses the elephant in the living room.Although the public schools account for about 85% of the student population in the United States, they represent nearly 100% of the fatal shootings. This is statistically significant and is no accident.For although the authors fail to mention it, the main reason for this discrepancy is that the public schools are basically amoral. God, prayer, and even american tradition are absent from them.The separation of church from state has not kept religion out of the public schools. Far from it. Rather amoral secular humanism has become the de facto form of worship there.Among other things, this has removed much of the inner self restraint that traditionally kept students in line which in turn has lead to school shootings."
4,Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shooting,"This book, gives a new perspective on school shootings. The author creates a new theory behind the roots of these happenings. It gives the background, accounts of students, faculty, community officials, and community members perspectives to these shootings as well. Overall, it helps the reader to put school shootings into perspective."
3,Great on Statistics,"I don't want to say ""I'm a big Fan"" of this genre, But I do my fair share of reading about school shooters & Rampage Killers.This book does not really bring anything new to the table, but is worth having if for no other reason than it has a history of shootings that stretches all the way back to the 70's. (All trends, graphs and studies usually start in the 90's when the killings reached their appex.) It was interesting to see thatback then the trend tended to be ""Shoot Authority Figures!"" asopposed to today's killers who tend to hunt their peers instead.Makes the book worth having, buy it."
1,Very Bad,Very bad product. Not work. The company say that is a new tecnologic but is not a good equipment. I will not buy again.
1,Not Voyeuristic,"This film plays like a poorly written late night cable movie or an R-rated soap-opera. One reviewer claimed that it was slightly more explicit than a standard ""Playboy"" film. It is not. It is less. There is no more explicit nudity than what could be found in a rated-R movie. It's just more frequent. This is also not a good movie for couples since it involves arguments and cheating. Only one scene was related to voyeurism."
3,Still worth reading,"For someone who is interested in recent European History this book seemed ideal. And I admit - it is well written, comprehensive and told me a lot about the last 1,000 years of Europe.However, its obvious disadvantage is that it was written over 110 years ago - omitting all historical facts discovered since.But the main problem - and it's a very basic and important one - is the total absence of dozens or more maps - it is difficult to visualize Austria ruling The Netherlands without a visual image.The best part about it is the price - $0.00 - thus making it well worth reading with all the caveats I've said above"
3,History,"Book is only mildly interesting without the maps. Too bad they did not come with the digital version. Hard to tell the history of Western Europe without maps and other graphics. It is, however, concise and well written."
1,move inn,i like the fast and the furious movie bikous its amizing you could even see nice cars so you could have any idea of cars you can even learn about cars.
4,"Fun moive, looks and sounds great on HD DVD","This movie is pretty brain dead, but a fun ride anyway. It looks and sounds phenomenal on HD DVD--a bit step up from the already decent DVD release. I now have the other two movies in the series on order on HD DVD."
4,Surprisingly Good,Fast paced with lots of action. Way better than the first one. Tyrese and Paul Walker have great chemistry together. If you liked a movie like Cradle To The Grave you are going to love this.*Wanted to give it 3 and a half stars not four.
5,Can't wait for 3 Fast 3 Furious,"This is the best movie ever. Fast cars, more fast cars, and then EVEN MORE FAST CARS! Does not disappoint."
5,very good,I love this series. It keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen next. I was so surprised when I saw the price. Amazon was the cheapest.
3,Click Click Boom! I mean Gas Gas Vroom!!,"Click Click Boom! Does this story make me get excited and giddy, well the answer is nah the only film worse then this with Paul Walker is ""In to the Deep"" but that's another story. What really excites me about his film is that it's a sequel to one of my favorite films of all time. This movie is defintely cheesy and very very unbelievable. But hey I still enjoy it, it's refreshing seeing Paul Walker still young not like in the 4th movie and now 5th movie that's about to be released. Overall it's a fun cheesy film. Enjoy!"
3,Not as good as the first,"I'm not implying that the first movie was a masterpiece, but I do think that the first part was better. Still, its a good sequel and follows the storyline well, without any continuity errors."
3,Not as good as the first,"Could be better, some one told Paul Walker he could act and they keep paying him for it. Way to go Paul."
3,A Worthy Sequel,"Pretty good flick. Much better than I expected. Pretty decent story line. Fans of the first will definetely enjoy this. Tyrese Gibson can act...Who knew ? Great action, and all the car chases you can handle...probably more. Eva Mendes is nice to look at...as always, and Cole Hauser is cool as hell...as always. If hot cars, hot girls, great action and a better than expected story are your thing....Give this a look. A generally good film. 3 Stars."
5,One of the best movies ever,I normally prefer romantic / comedies but this movie is definitely one of my favourite movies ever. This movie has a bit of everything in it. My entire family loves it.
5,Best fun is you're own!,"I found this movie to be worth a lot of fun before it was a lot of fun, and that is because everyone in the movie got along so well. The leadership behind the movie shows through in a-typical ways lending a deafening mode to the good beating out the bad guys. You can't say that it is loud justice, because you would never hear it; but in never betraying sophistication, it makes a towering intellectual victory. All of the scenes and stunts are absolutely devouring and the attention paid to the plot by the actors is at the very least a true marvel. And everything else is what happens when everything I just said, happens!"
4,out of the country seller,The movie was in good condition. My problem was that I needed the item by a certain day and nowhere did it say this was an OUT OF THE COUNTRY SELLER! I think that needs to be posted somewhere so that you know before you buy your product. I contacted them and they had slow contact time so of course it was already sent out and too late.
5,PERFECT CONDITION AND VERY FAST SHIPPING,ITEM CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION AND THE SHIPPING WAS PRETTY FAST. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE.
3,Downshifting into the next Level!!!!!!,"2 fast 2 furious was indeed good but not so good I mean The reason I went is to see the Nissan Skyline!!!Overal the street racing was cool just to much special effects.Lets get real vipers,corvette,s281 saleen stang cant catch 2 imports?@ imports beatinging up Powerhouse muscle.Dont get me wrong Im a huge import fan but the whole movie doesnt make sense its just loose you from the beginning like whats the whole point.Dont get me wrong the racing is cool but the plot is corny."
1,worst sequel of 2003 if not the worst movie of 2003,this movie was the biggest waste of time and money.bad acting bad script bad actors bad directer bad producer this movie is the worst sequel of the 2003 if not the worst movie of 2003 If you are lookng for laugh go watch this garbage I this soap orphras have better acting then this movie I have no idea how movie got 4 stars because it stunk please dont wast your time or money on this movie this movie doesn't even deserve a 1 star
3,Tyrese Did It For Me,"I might potentially have groupie tendencies when it comes to Tyrese. Pretty much any movie that he's put in, I'm going to track run to the show to see. To put in one of my other favorite things to look at (cars) only complimented the movie more. The cop in ""The Fast and the Furious"" is on the lookout to arrest some dealers and needs some manpower to help him out. He comes up on an ex-con and a past friend, Tyrese's character, to help him fight the bad guys. Again, I don't get into action movies, but pretty much every time Tyrese came on set, I was all eyes and ears. I didn't really get into Eva Mendez's character and the end of the movie was way too Hollywood for me, but the building of the plot, and again the cars, helped it out some. I was also delighted to see Ludacris in this one."
2,"""Entertaining, But The First One Is Better""","Come back Vin Diesel. Diesel turned down this film because he wanted more money, bad mistake. ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" made almost as much money as the first one in the box-office. This film was entertaining, the girls were hot, but I left the theater, wanting more."
3,Better than the first!,"I liked this movie. I didn't like the first, so i thought this one was better. I recommend it to anyone who loved the first one.MPAA: PG-13Running Time: 108 minutesYear released: 2003"
2,I just didn't get it!,The whole film just felt like a waste of time. What was the moral of the story? Many scenes were done with beautiful photography and some of the car chases were great. Maybe I just missed the point of it?
1,So-so sequel,"This movie wasn't much without Vin Diesel. Tyrese was funny, but Paul Walker should have had Vin to back him up in his acting. The cars were great, but Eva Mendes can't make up for the abscence of Vin and Michelle Rodriguez. Better luck with the next movie, guys. Make it more worth our time to watch."
2,lame sequel to a great movie,"Vin Diesel was right to stay out of this one. It flopped big time when I watched it in the theaters. I was so bored. yeah, ok, cars speeding there, he jumps a gap in the bridge, ok. lame action. not even close as better to the first one. the first one had style and ok Ludacris is in this one but who cares about him, hes not a good actor. Ja Rule outacted him in the first one, Ja Rule was way much better then him"
2,Not quite what I thought,"When I rented Fast and Furious, the Tricked Out version, I saw the Turbo trailer. I thought this movie would involve all that was in it. I would've loved to see what happened right when Vin Diesel left. How does an LA cop make it to Miami? Where does the hot chick fit into all of it? How did Brian manage to get away from the cops over and over again? Why did the guy decide to get a right wheeler car?That would've been enough for me to recommend buying this thing. There are plenty of bikini and fast speed scenes. But other than that, snore snore snore."
1,If I could only find the words...,This movie has set a new degree of boredom for me. Why is it that this year seems to have had a bunch of really bad films. All I can say is that I didn't like this movie at all.
3,2 Fast 2 Furious,"This was on my grnddaughter's wish list. It is certainly not my kind of entertainment, but she loves it.Your service, delivery and ease of shopping made my holiday less work and more fun, thanks.Bettie Btodka"
2,Garbage compared to the first.,Paul Walker can act as well as a brick wall. He is that bad.But beyond that the movie is semi-watchable.The Skyline race at the beginning was the highlight of the film and the rest just went downhill. The cars rocked in the first one from old school muscle to tricked Civics and Supras. What do we get in the sequel? Two Mitsubishi stinkers.Did Mitsubishi pay off the director or something to have their dying car lines in the movie?All in all it was an ok popcorn movie but it is a total waste when compared to Diesel and the first movie.
2,Where is Vin!!???,"This film seriously lacks the prescence of Vin Diesel. It gets by without him, but most of the coolness that was Fast and Furious is gone. Paul Walker can't carry the film, and Tyrese is a substandard Diesel replacement, he's okay is his part, gets a few laughs, but he's got nowhere near the presence, nor the wry smile.The plot, well it's just a silly drug runners and cops story that becomes ridiculous by the end, heck even Tyrese said as much in the outtakes.The cars - They suck, I'm sorry but the Supra in no.1 kicked [rear] over the big Mitsubishi product placement that is 2Fast 2Furious... I mean the Lancer EVO 7??? hardly gets the blood running, it looks like a compact family car.The girls - There is a well freaky looking chick in this film that drives the Honda S2000, sigh, where is Michel Rodrigues, she was kewl (and a great match of Vin).Anyway, it's still ok, but they should have just paid Vin whatever he wanted, it would have been a better film for it."
3,devon aoki is hot,"I give this movie 3 stars because some of the cars are cool and Devon Aoki is very hot. The things that suck about this movie are the acting, (especially Paul Walker, it makes me cringe to watch this guy act) Ludacris (what a clown) and all the moronic rap music. Isn't this garbage out of style yet."
3,2 Little 2 Late,"I would have to say the glamour and glory of this film was great, flashy cars, fast women, drugs, money, etc. Besides Paul Walker, the rest of the cast was 2 lack of acting and screen friendly. Should have knitted a sweater instead of watching the movie"
1,BOOOOOOO!!!!,when i recieved this in the mail and opened it up there was no movie in the case only the bounus disk
5,2 fast 2 furious,this was a christmas gift to a family member and she loved it. bought this and tokyo drift...she loves the trilogy! can't stop watching. recommened to those who like these types of movies
4,See It For Hot Stars And Hot Cars,See 2 Fast 2 Furious for hot hunks Paul Walker and Tyrese who both are shirtless in this movie. Check out the cool rides as well. For us boys check out Eva Mendes...
3,Not as good as the First.,I think that 2Fast2Furious didn't spend to much time on the moive. The rush everything to make sure when it was time to release the movie it would be done so the views could go out and see it. There where only 2 races in the whole movie and not to many cars to look at. To me The Fast and Furious kills this movie by far.
1,A great comedy,"I never laughed so hard until I saw 2F2F. While in the theater I accidently stood up several times, pointed my finger at the screen and yelled something to the effect ot ""HAHA you stupid ricers"".The movie is so unrealistic I have no clue why the liberal media is moaning that this movie is promoting street racing, that's just Darwin at work.Why is it unrealistic? Why would people put 800 pounds of junk like stereo equipment and playstations on a race car. Weight robs speed.Also I love the ricer graphics. If you need a good laugh, see this movie!The acting was ok, the stunts were ok, the women were ok nothing spectacular except the nice, huge & comfy leather seats at the cinema."
1,Just stupid,"I saw this movie at my friend's house, and it was terrible. Stupid movie. Unrealistic, stupid, pathetic movie. Part one was alright, and I was expecting something a little better. Guess not."
3,Paul Walker can't speak 'ebonics'...,"Let's face it. If you saw the first installment (99 out of 100 of you), you didn't watch the sequel with anything in mind but more hot chicks, more kick ass cars, and more spectacular race sequences. From the moment the drawbridge went up in the first race sequence I knew this movie wasn't going to dissapoint (from those perspectives, of course).The plot is textbook. The cops are stupid (INCREDIBLY stupid). The 'lead' actors are laughable (Paul's 'cuz-talk' actually makes for some of the most hilarious 'I'm trying really hard to sound like I'm from the hood' dialog I've heard in awhile!).BUT...There is eye candy everywhere. The cars kick ass. The special effects kick ass. The races kick ass. Anything to do with driving in this movie kicks ass.Then, who really went to see this expecting anything but? The movie delivers exactly where it's supposed to. Defenitely worth the rent.Let's see the '455 Rocket' as the star of #3!!!"
1,So bad I'm almost speechless.,"We got this as a gag gift for X-mas. Yes. It's that bad. I Don't know anything about cars, but I do know that the dudes shift gears like 20 times in one straighaway and I don't think cars have that many gears do they? Also - there are many scenes where people aren't wearing seatbelts. This is supposed to be marketed to young people, and I don't mind the illegal racing, but at least wear your freakin seatbelts people! I know street racing is alive and well, but the movie doesn't seem very realistic - they weren't even winning enough money to cover the damages on their cars from the race! Anyway - the acting is bad, as to be expected in a movie more about cars than people. And I was a little dissapointed that dude didn't get the girl in the end - what's up with that?"
1,Oh please....,"One day, some brainwashed, MTV moron came up with the idea to mix rap and street racing and put it in a movie. He gave us The Fast and The Furious. Boy, that movie was terrible. Now, he decides to make a sequel(Why?) and puts more rap in it, but this time, Ludacris shows up. I hope this Fast and The Furious trend dies off along with that dumb, ""gangsta"" rap trend."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"Its da best ever, for da first one i went to da movies to watch it like 5 times then brought it its alsome , and da second 1 is spose to be even better with ludacris and hes not a cop no more :D , i would recommend it to anyone who loves der car and anyone who wants a good action movie."
1,This is your mind on ethanol,"Talk about a crummmy job. It's hard to decide which is worse - the acting, dialogue, photography, sound, ""plot"", or racing. If you are a racing addict and want some perky babes at the same time this may fill the bill for a few minutes. But that's all there is.The plot must be the product of a ""Movies for Dummies"" book, some mixed-up story about crime and racing and deadlines and gals and friends. The only thing more predictable than the plot is the acting which is straight out of Central Casting. Even my son who loves this type of movie admitted it was a ""dog"" which, in any generation, means bad. Avoid at all costs."
1,What in the Hell is this? this deserves no stars what so ever!,"One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed!"
1,ABOUT AS ENTERTAINING AS WATCHING MICHAEL JACKSON DRY-HUMP HOWDY DOODY,I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT.(...)
1,Complete Crap,"Should have been called ""The Bulls**t and the Horses**t"", basically just a stupid movie for stupid people."
4,FORGET THE STORY... LOOK AT THE PICTURE!!,"When I first seen 2 Fast 2 Furious, it wasn't all that to me. I first watched this movie with my old tv so that can be called ""480i"" television.By the time I got an new HDTV from Wal-Mart, it an Sanyo model: DP26746 Integrated HDTV.. I had my Playstation 3 hook up to that HDTV with HDMI cable and play that movie in the slot and the quality looks so good, I had to adjust my brightness a little dark. Well thats all I can say about this movie, it has the best picture and the story is just average but fun. So, if u get the same device i have.. you will see what I am talking about. My HDTV display resolution at 1366 x 768 WXGA screen, so you know it is above 720p and less than 1080i/1080p but great picture on screen."
4,Es muy buena,"Es una de las pocas secuelas que me gusta, por lo general las segundas partes no lo son. Sobre todo la introduccion que hace el DVD sobre como sigue la historia despues de que Vin Diesel escapa. Excelente!!"
4,okay,"okay movie, the case was broken when it arrived, so the cd was loose inside, it doesnt look as new"
4,Much better than the 1st one,"I am ""NOT"" a MTV person, or a Vin Desil triple X fanatic...but I can honestly say that this sequel is a very good movie.I hated part 1, so I was very surprised by enjoying this movie. The sepecil effects are better!!!! And the racing scenes seem more realistic.If you like fast cars, then you should buy this DVD."
3,"a little cheesey,yet awesome","2 Fast 2 Furious was an awesome movie,simply put.The race scenes were the coolest.Making the camera shake when the cars go by was a cool effect.That Suka girl is mighty fine,too.;-) The dailogue is kinda cheesey,but the rest of the movie made up for it big time."
4,THE BOMB,I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I LOVE LUDACRIS AND VEN DISEL THEY ARE SO CUTE .I LOVE RACING AND CARS. I DONT GET ENOUGH OF THIS MOVIE.
1,i'll make this nice and short...,a better title for 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS is 2 DUMB 2 STUPID! a total yawner from start to finish. the MIAMI VICE pilot episode is better than this garbage!
2,Horrible,"Paul Walker returns in this sequel to 2001's The Fast and the Furious. Brian O'Conner (Walker) has left L.A due to his illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami making money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes (Mendes), Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by Agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Hauser)in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barsto, Arizona where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese) to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With the help of Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. This was a horrible movie. There was no reason to make a sequel. They should have stopped after the first one."
5,Great movie,"Then is must-see fot the summer 03. this movie has everything fast cars,beautiful women,and non-stop action.I think that Tyrese fill the role of Vin diesel nicely. This movie is kick ... all the way. Can't wait for fast and the furious 3. Go check it out this summmer."
3,Fast trip to the bank?,"John Singleton steps in for directing duties after Rob Cohen's free-wheeling FAST AND THE FURIOUS made a sizeable dent in the summer box-office back in 2000 despite luke-warm reviews. But the question remains: Will this be yet another notch in the long string of thoughtless, cash-in sequels? Probably, since the notable lack of Cohen and Vin Diesel this time around. Sure, it'll clean up in cinemas, and who cares if whats-his-name isn't in it as long as it's got enough hot chicks, cool car chases and an ear-splitting soundtrack right? Yes, lower your expectations and it's sure to be a blast."
1,Horrible,"I was absolutely SHOCKED when I saw that a director with the ability of John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood, Poetic Justice, Higher Learning) had crafted this mess.There is just no plot, no script, sub-par effects, and atrocious acting. When are people going to learn that Paul Walker's hair can't carry a movie. If I heard him say ""'bro"" one more time I was going to throw my TV out a window.If you have the option, just lay out the money to go to a car show. You'll get to wander around as long as you want looking at all the tricked-out super-cars without all that annoying ""movie"" thing to get in the way."
2,Listless after reading this,I just finished this book. It was a very irritating read. The mother was hysterical half the time and the daughter...some of the drug passages seemed a little shallow and undeveloped. The rape scene seemed fake. The skinhead episode seemed overblown. She never seemed in danger with these people.I did however liked reading about Morava.
4,"A little wordy, but good overall","Very gripping story, I didn't want to put it down. Claire is a little wordy at times and I found myself skipping paragraphs, but overall I loved it. Really makes you feel for the authors and understand their pain from each side."
2,Brainwashed authors?,"This is a strange memoir written by Claire and Mia Fontaine (not their real names) about bizarre WWASP schools (prison-like residential teen boot camps) and how they helped Mia conquer drug addiction. However, this book almost seems like a pro-WWASP book to counter all the negative press WWASP schools receive. A lot of this book was unbelievable, too. Weak writing. I'm not sure I believe that Clair Fontaine actually is a screenwriter, either. Could be the next literary hoax....."
3,Offers Perspective you might not otherwise have,"Comeback was an engaging read. A troubled teenager is sent away to a rehab/school. The mother & daughter individually write about their encounter enabling the reader to learn each of their viewpoints. It was interesting to see how they each went through different but similar experiences throughout the ""process"" and end up at a mutual place. I was uncertain about liking it in the beginning but overall I learned from the book & found myself thinking about it in applications to my life & others' too. I felt the daughter's writing was more sincere & the mothers's was more forced - as if she was writing to write vs writing honestly about the experience."
5,"Wonderful book, lots of lessons.","What an amazing book,it is so honest and raw, but also funny and up-lifting. The way Claire and Mia repaired their relationship was so illuminating for me. Even though my life is very different than Mia's, I saw myself in her in ways that made me realize how easily I blame my mom for a lot of things instead of seeing some of my own responsibility. This book makes you see how much power we have to change our lives if we have the courage and the love. It is also a joy to read a book so well written.Highly recommended for anyone any age!"
4,Hopeful,"I found this very true to life. Although the circumstances were different for me, Claire described my feelings perfectly. It was nice to know that someone, somewhere, really understands what I am going through. It gave me hope."
2,You should know,"I bought the book because i have a 3 year old daughter and i was excited to read a book about a mother daughter relationship, especially one that covered the difficult teen years that I have to look forward to! What I didn't expect after just reading the first chapter was all the disturbing parts regarding her 3 - 4 year old being sexually molested by her drug addict husband who obviously grew up in an environment that made that horrendous behaviour seem permissible. Had I known I was going to be subjected to reading that, I would not have bought the book. I understand that if you have a child going through drug issues it is probably an insightful book to read. But I would have liked to have known that there was incest involving a toddler in this book before I bought it. I found it too troubling to read. Just a heads up. Maybe it wouldn't offend others as it has me but I thought I would at least put it out there. I am returning the book tomorrow as I can't read anymore."
5,"Amazing book about love, life and relationships","I loved this book from page one, word one. It really does prove that love can conquer all and that there is always hope. You don't have to be a parent with a child going through similar things or even a parent to benefit from this book. A must read!"
4,Heavy subjects but very interesting,"Although this book touches on some very serious and heavy subjects (incest, drug use, run always, rehab), it does do in an interesting format. I found myself looking forward to the parts written in the daughters ""voice."" This was a very quick read for me."
4,Ashdown Academy,"This is a book about life in boarding school. Elizabeth Norah Chapman is going to Ashdown Academy, a boarding school where boys are forbidden, for the school year. As soon as Eliza meets Helen, a sneaky, mischievous girl,the story takes off. Before I read this book, I thought boarding schools were only for boarders. When I read ""The Daring Game"", I thought, ""What? You can go to a boarding school without boarding? That's outrageous!"" But this book was so good, it only took me three days to finish. I definitely recommend this book for girls interested in boarding school."
1,"Daring Game, The","This book is the worst i've ever read. It moves much too slow and doesn't live up to its title, The Daring Game. It should have more 'dares' if you ask me. It only has around three dares.The Daring Game does , though , have a sensible problem and characters."
4,"Great product, horribe assembly","This sliding table is like all Exaktor products I've come across. Its well built, well designed, and brings some assembly required to new heights. Imagine your new car came in 50,000 parts, with an incomprehensible instruction manual. That's exaktor.I'm mechanically talented. I own lots of tools. I've assembled lots of tools. I can't imagine what putting this together would be like for the average person.Once assembled - 5 stars. Great product, nothing cheap about the parts. I have some design tweaks I'd make - square the table to itself, then make it parallel to the miter slot, THEN do what they say and adjust the outer rail, as just taking the alignment of the inner rail to the saw could result in the hell of being 3/32 off - pretty much unsolvable the way they want you to solve it. Try to get that inner rail as parallel as possible...The assembly process gets one star. And doesn't deserve that high a ranking. Try it. You'll see..."
3,No better than drug store brands,"I bought this product because it was advertised as sweat-proof. It is not. I work out regularly and this self tanner, like the drug store brands, streaks and blotches when you sweat.. even mildly. It does give you a nice base tan with in a few hours. However, it does have an orange tint in the daylight, and isn't any better than the drug store brands, of which I have tried MANY. It also fades blotchy. For this quality, I would suggest Loreal Sublime self tanner which is my favorite of the drug store brands and is a fraction of the cost."
5,Larry Pontius shines again!,"Larry Pontius shines again!This time he has created an incredible heartfelt collection of poems in his new book, Lyrics of Life, In Four Part Harmony. This collection is a treasure to own and a great way to immerse yourself. Larry is a writer's writer who penetrates your heart and mind.Soliza... ""The Legend of the Dream Castle"""
2,Considering the cost it is a poor quality product,"I was really excited to have a plunge drill. The concept sounded great. The tool store I shop told me it is made by a company from down under.Upon purchase, I found out it is made is China. The drill is very heavy and when it comes to power it does not come close to other expensive drills. The first time I tried to use it I found the plunge locking clamp to be very stiff. So I used a pair of pliers to gently tighten it and it broke instantly. It seems to be made of pot metal. There is a lot of thin plastic on the body also. One of the batteries would not charge when I first brought it home. I left it alone and the next day it started charging on its own.I would have expected more for the money. Great concept but poor manufacturing."
1,"Good drill, awful batteries and charger","Battery charging is a nuisance in that you must power down/power up the charger prior to recharging a battery. Since there's no power switch on the charger this can only be accomplished by unplugging waiting 10 seconds and replugging the charger. On top of this, the batteries give very short run time and a full charge barely lasts 2 days when left unused in the drill. The LED is easily turned on with the user being unaware and will run down the battery in a short time. Drill works great, batteries/charger do not."
2,A collection of marriage jokes grounded in bitterness,"This book is another one in the very long line of lengthy jokes about marriage. Many common words are ""defined"" in the context of marriage and to maintain the joke, they are almost exclusively negative. Some examples are:Imaginative - Any idea you come up with to enliven sex which your spouse funds too gross.Jello - The only food that your husband ever learned to cook.Joint bank account - Checking account which allows you to spend your spouse's money any way that you want.Period - The five days of the month when your wife does not have PMS.While I acknowledge that some people will find these jokes funny, I did not. I find marriage jokes to be grounded in a sense of bitterness that removes any humorous aspects that they may have."
3,Should Have Been Much Better,"Other than cost, no reason to choose this set over the old ""30th Anniversary"" collection on Rhino. With only 20 tracks and certainly room for 7 or 8 more, it's missing plenty of Victor and United Artists hits. Also, although these are the original hits, the sound quality is not quite up to the 30th Anniversary set or the Taragon ""Essential RCA '62-'68"" disc from the late 90's. Also, ""Steel Guitar"" is mono here, stereo on other collections. It makes me wonder if the Aussies had access to the first generation master tapes."
3,Wrong Diana version?,"I brought this CD after reading all other reviews on Amazon.Most songs sound good except for the first song Diana.I'm sure this is not the original hit version,Tony"
1,The Most of Paul Anka,Buyer beware! I thought I was buying the two cd set but got a single disc. Not bad as one but not what I thought I ordered. Bait and switch?
5,An Informative & Enjoyable Read! Recommended!,"Byock has done it again! This is ""a must"" for any person who has any kind of interest in the sagas of Iceland, in Vikings, or in medieval Europe. Highly informative, yet a pleasure to read! Bravo!"
5,Doo-Wop Acappella,"Interesting set of Doo-Wop styled acappella takes on a wide range of material (some classics, some popular and an originals).Tracks are:Stuck With You (from: Huey Lewis & the News)Hello City (Barenaked Ladies)I've Gotta Get a Message to You (Bee Gees/arr. Moxy Fruvous)Melissa (Allman Brothers)Off and OnThe Lazy Boy (Moxy Fruvous)With or Without You (U2)Can't Help Falling in Love With You (Elvis Presley)You Can Call Me Al (Paul Simon)In the Still of the Night (arr. Boys II Men)Kokomo (Beach Boys)One (U2)"
1,Serendipity,"I was sad & disappointed to find out that her idea of ""serendipity"" is to receive more than you have paid for. Isn't there enough dishonesty in the world already? I quote, ""Serendipity is putting a quarter in the gumball machine and having three pieces come rattling out instead of one--all red."" Does this mean when I pay for my groceries with a $10 bill and the clerk gives me change for a $20 bill it's ""serendipitous"", and I'm not supposed to point out the mistake and return what's not rightfully mine? Teaching ""those only knee-high"" that it's their right to get more than they deserve will only lead to more dishonesty and ""you owe me attitude"" in the world. What was she thinking? Honestly?"
5,If only American television could be this good,"Shown on BBC America a few months ago, this is a series worth owning. Based on Val McDermid's book series, the shows are a trimmed down version of some of the stories. I recomend the books and the television series as they both hold their own.The Wire in the Blood television series is dark, creepy, gritty, and compelling. These are psychological dramas that don't sugar-coat the crimes, the people, or the situations. They're not for everyone, but the majority of mystery/crime drama fans will find them more than satisfying. The characters are well written and acted without being standard or cliche and the stories, while dark, are a compelling look into the psychology of criminal profiling and anaylysis.Good characters, strong writing and high production standards is what really sells this series."
4,For Every Nerd With Dreams of Grandeur,"I found this series especially delightful because Robson Green's character lives within the confines of his own mind. Though he shows remarkable insight into the actions of the violent and deranged, he also displays that phenomenal lack of social consciousness that is particular to geniuses and artists (as in ""Yes, I just invented nuclear fission, but no, I didn't know I was supposed to wear socks and shoes to this award ceremony.""). This makes for some truly unusual and amusing situations, that help bring levity to the gruesome crimes he investigates. If you like Touching Evil or Monk, this series may be for you."
2,Way too graphic....,"I must admit that I only watched about 45 minutes of the first episode, but that was because the torture scenes were WAY too graphic- hence the low review. I love BBC crime dramas and am not squeamish at all (loved ""300"", ""Prime Suspect and ""Cracker"" for example) but some of these scenes were so over the top that I was unable to enjoy the movie; it made me sick to my stomach. I realize that the episode was about a serial killer, but I have watched many other movies with similar themes that did not cross the line like this one. I do wish I had sampled one of the other episodes to see if it was a little more watchable. I did like both the leads."
5,Wire in Blood first season,Robson Green is mesmerizing as the socially inept and eccentric clinical psychologist. The character is a departure from Green's usual more forceful commanding charaters. I was spellbond by the story plots and watched the series in two evenings. If you like psychological thrillers or are a fan of Robson Green this is a must see.
4,Additive!!,"Shorted this series one star for one reason - Cost vs Amount. The price is a bit steep for the amount of episodes you receive, but I must say that Brits can really put together a very entertaining drama. I have already ordered Season II, despite the cost. The price of addiction...."
3,Big Fan of Series,"Not as many episodes as I would have liked. This DVD only contains four episodes would have liked more, love the series."
5,Exceptional show,I just discovered this show a few months ago on BBC America. I'm totally hooked on Robson Green. I've just ordered Touching Evil as well. This is quality adult television.
5,Intense,This is very intense and has you sitting on the edge of your seat. Its very good writing and the plot is one I could never fathom. It actually scared me and makes me think there are some very psychotic people in society today.
1,Graphic torture and terror murders,"I found the Wire in the Blood series too graphic and full of torture for my taste. Homosexuality and torture are parts of every story, and mystery is overshadowed by a sense of deviate behavior. Not good viewing for healthy minds."
5,Wire in the Blood,"Gritty, graphic, brilliant and mesmerizing. This series is very smart. If you have the stomach for this, it is addicting."
5,Wire in the Blood,This is an outstanding series with Dr Hill being so unique. Its hard to tell sometimes whether he should be a patient or the pyschologist. His relationship with Carol is warm and thier friendship is beneficial to both of them. Its nice to see a woman actor play a script where it is written for a women. In American series the woman's role is written for a man and just play by a woman. It really makes it cartoonish. Wire In the Blood's characters are complete people with faults and emotions. I love this series and hopefully everyone will get a chance to see it.
3,Wire in the blood,"The serie is completely perfect, amazing actors and all season are amazing, but terrible for latin people. English subs at least we need. thank you"
5,I love this series!,"Robson Green is a gem. Besides inventing some weird murders, this series has created a really interestingly torn character in Dr. Tony Hill. He is drawn like a moth to flame to these creepy murders even though it is obvious that the police dept. is ambivalent about using his services and even though the work takes an enormous psychic toll on him. I heartily recommend the entire series. Liked the first three with the original female detective."
1,"Cheap Photocopy, Not A Poster","This product is advertised as a ""poster"", but in actuality it is a cheaply produced scanned photocopy on HP photo paper... You can find the picture online and do it yourself for a buck. With the cost of the ""poster"" and outrageously high S&H charges, I paid $21 for an 8""x10"" blurry photo that when scanned was extremely digitized. I was ripped off."
3,Kontor 14 - Top of the Charts,"Out of all the KONTOR CDs that I own, I say that 14 is the best. Disc 2 has the best tracks and music that you can actually get down and dance to. But as always with KONTOR CDs 1 CD is [not good] and the other is fairly good."
4,quick read,"This book had a different take on fturistic societal living that kept me reading. The plot took several twists that, for once, I didnt figure out in advance. Well written. I would like to see a follow-up book by this author taking up where he left off. Interesting ideations and new plot for a change."
3,Entertaining but...,"Good ""page turner"" and entertaining.I however think that this book is a bit overrated. The plot is quite predictable and the writing not that good.What however bothered me the most is, whithout spoiling anything, the banalization of rape, sex with underage girls, omnipresent tobacco use, etc. Some would say that's because this book was written 40 years ago but I don't think that pedophilia and rape were useful in this story. Some would argue that the author wanted to show human weakness... However, the main character seemed to condone these acts and even did it himself... Those were only very small parts of the book (a few lines, really) but they left me a sour taste..."
3,Haven't We Seen All This Before?,"The resemblance to Huxley's ""Brave New World"" is so marked here that one can't help feeling just a little disappointed with Levin, who is far too good a writer to have produced something so derivative.Not that the book is badly written or fails to entertain; Levin is much too good at what he does for that to happen. It's just that this is old territory, and Levin (uncharacteristically) does not really bring anything new to the subject matter.""This Perfect Day"" is a good read; all of Levin's work is good reading. But if you read Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty Four,"" Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" and Zamiatin's ""We,"" you might be surprised, for Levin appears to have lifted ideas from all of these novels. I suppose the genre itself is somewhat narrow, but Levin's other work is much more original than this one."
3,Over Rated By Amazon Users,"I just completed This Perfect Day and I will admit that it was a ""page turner"" and ""hard to put down."" I would wholy recomend this book to night time security gaurds who are tired of watching Three Company re-runs. However, TPD is not a 5 star book. The quality of the writing in mediocre and the plot is recycled. This book reminded me a great deal of John Christopher's ""Tripod"" series, just that Levin is bold enough to use foul language and include a rape scene in his book. Also similar is Peter Dickinson's ""The Changes"" series. TPD does not offer any new insights into the human conscience, only reminded us of our flaws."
4,Great story about a bleak future,"A fantastic tale of the horrors of a future society that abdicates freedom in exchange for efficiency. As with The Boys From Brazil, Levin's ""This Perfect Day"" would seem prophetic if written today, and is astounding considering it predates 1970. Before picking this up, I had no idea Levin had written any science fiction, and was pleased to find this book as thought-provoking and thrilling as his others. The writing was tight, the characters realistic (even for the future), the tone modern, and there were twists throughout. It also ends on a happier note than do many of Levin's other works.Incidentally, ""This Perfect Day"" reminded me a little of (Heinlein's) Stranger In A Strange Land in terms of its sexually cavalier mores (it is surprisingly passionate), and- as with Stranger's ""grok""- in the way some of its catch phrases should be (are (?)) a part of the science fiction vernacular (""Fight Uni""; ""Christ, Marx, Wood, and Wei"")."
3,A little disappointed...,"But, it was definitely food for thought as to what a futuristic society could be like. Just wish the author had developed his characters a little bit more. But, I got this on sale in the kindle store so I am not upset over the $2.99 I lost in purchasing this book."
4,Bingo!,"This is exactly what I was looking for.Fog lamp Switch for 1"" dia. bar.Quality you can trust. US made."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"The other reviewer must be related to this director.This is ONE of the worst movies I've seen, though right now I can't think of one that ranks below it.I was just about to shut if off at one point but made myself stick with it because there wasn't anything on TV.The acting was laugh out loud bad, the business about the shooter going insane went on and on and on. Yeah, beat the viewers over the head since they are too stupid to get it that he's traumatized.Several scenes started or ended without explnation. Scenes of, say, a card game, a game of catch with a soccer ball, and others - were supposed to be on different days but were clearly all shot the same day with actors wearing the same clothes, positioned the same and with props in the same place.I could go on but why bother.The story concept was a good one and needs to be told, but this was an embarassing attempt and casts a terrible light on Korean cinema."
2,It's okay,"It's a nice book and easy to read. However for me, I found it to be a bit ""lightweight' and was looking for a bit more information."
2,THE FAULT IS WITH ME,"UP FRONT---I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED """"THE KNOWN WORLD"""".THAT SAID--I THOUGHT THIS BOOK READ LIKE AN 800 PAGE BOOKIN STEAD OF A 400 PAGE BOOK. OF THE 14 STORIES--I ONLYFOUND THREE OF THEM OKAY--JUST OKAY--SORRY. I GUESS--I AM JUST NOT SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH."
4,It is a good CD for Kent Starters,"This is a nice double CD with many musics from Kent, who is introducing it self in their music this is a good option. Definatelly they are as good as any British/American rock band."
1,"Adorable, but immediately broke","I'm a loyal Fedex customer, and my son loves their trucks. Bought this for Xmas. Two days later, the axles broke, and the wheels fell apart. We were all disappointed."
4,Can't beat the Price!,"If you find yourself interested in using Sonlight or other expensive social studies curriculum for homeschooling, this will definitely save you a lot of time and money! You can get all the books from your public library for free. This book has essay questions about each book, as well as comprehensive questions to go with each chapter of the books. So nice to have everything all together in one book. If you need something flexible and literature based for US History -- Get this!"
2,"This book is more of a curriculum guide for teachers, not a history book for kids to read.","I thought this would be a good book for my boys to read, based on the title. Good thing they allow you to peek inside.This book is definitely a guide for teachers and parents to use to teach history to your kid. I want a nice history book written for a child reader who is interested in reading about history. The title of this book should let readers know this is a guide."
2,looked better in the box,my six and 1/2 year old boy used it once and then lost complete interest. There are stencils and extras in the box that were not worth it.
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"Looked high and low for this cover for my husband's truck. Price was right, shipping reasonable, and it looks great!"
5,Blurred Vision T-Shirt,It is a nice T-shirt and I get a lot of comments about it from strangers. Overall the shirt is nice made of 100% cotton and is pretty good quality with no shrinking. Transaction was smooth and fast delivery.
3,Author's ego intertwined into a fascinating book.,"This is a book that will appeal to many readers in New Zealand, not only because of this famous murder trial but because it will take them back to the age of country innocence that they remember.David Yallop's ego is overpowering within the text to the point where one begins to doubt his own convictions, however most readers will feel vindicated when Arthur Allan Thomas is finally pardoned.Along with a lot of other New Zealanders I am convinced that Len Demler and his other daughter were involved in the Crewe deaths however, David Yallop himself is a main character in this account so it is a little difficult to feel as though you are really reading the facts.For those too young, whose back doesn't shiver when they hear the words 'Crewe murders',I would recommend taking a look at Yallop's fascinating and well-researched account of this 1970's double homicide and try and decide for yourself!"
2,Time will tell....,"The problem with a discussion of this book is that anyone who goes outside its parameters risks court action. Any bdiscussion while pricipal actors are still alive, which might seriously challenge Yallop's assertions must therefore await untill the hand of God permits a more open discussion of what did, and did not, what might, and what might not, have taken place.certainly, to dismiss the ""dead cartridge in the magazine"" theory out of hand as the one person Royal Commission did (and he was a person not without controversy in his own right) is hardly fair to anyone involved."
4,not bad at all,"the basic plot of this story is our heroine, courtney, is rescued by the hero, slayde, after almost being killed. the story goes on to reveal that there is a plot against slayde and his family that revolves around a curse.the story isn't bad at all. i like the hero and heroine, although slayde seems EXTREMELY overbearing towards his sister. however, it apparently isn't unjustified, as she is made out to be a flighty thing for the most part. i like both courtney and slayde, although sometimes courtney seemed a little too soft or something to me. however, she is very smart, and not hesitant to fight for what she wants. slayde also has no problem fighting for what he wants, and is an enjoyable character.all in all, it was a good read for some reason that i just can't articulate. definately a book to pick up if you have the time, as are most of kane's books. enjoy :)"
4,Low Carb Tortillas,My family really enjoyed these tortillas. I thought I had ordered the low-carb...but i received the regular ones. My family thought they were quite good. I might try again...but I am a little nervous about it.
5,Great tortillas,"These are not only great tasting tortillas, they are the only ones that I can find that do not have hydrogenated vegetable oil in them. They are the only ones we eat."
2,state of Japan's parties 1960,"The book provides a usually rather dry snapshot of post-war Japanese political parties, stopping at 1960. There are some prescient statements, ""...the Liberal Democratic and Socialist parties are likely to dominate the national scene for the forseeable future."" Not a bad prediction, considering the Liberal Democrat takeover was only three years old in 1960, and the ""one-and-a-half"" party system lasted another 24 years after 1960.It's hard to get a lot of post-war Japanese history in English as ""history"" rather than ""current events"" (John Dower's excellent Embracing Defeat is an exception) so I like to pick up outdated current events books like this one -- unfortunately, the book is awfully dry and technical, lots of raw data and charts. Some interesting analysis, but I ended up skipping a lot of pages. Cut to the chase."
2,Losely Understood,"As much as I want to rave about Tertium Organum, I can't. The early chapters of Tertium Organum build such a grand beginning with expectations that a deeper understanding would be found. What I discovered is a light weight conclusion that gave way to a religious experience that only suggests the author couldn't answer his own question. I can not recommend Tertium Organum. The author is well educated and has a talent for expressing his opinion in lanuage easily understood. Yet, what he promises for the reader at the begining, is not what the conclusion resulted in. I advise caution when attempting to embrack on this quest, and warn that though the author makes strong points, I felt less sure of my understanding of what I read and more upset with the lack of ability to end the conversation strongly."
1,This is indeed pseudo-science,"I agree with the previous review. The math is faulty, the philosophy the same. Ouspensky is a hack. This book is a mere curiosity, nothing more! Reader beware: The Fellowship of Friends, an international cult uses Ouspenskian philosophy as its centerpiece!"
5,"Understanding oneself, time and space","I cannot say it better than the American Prophet ""Edgar Cayce"", therefore I will Quote Mr. Cayce's Source from another wonderful book ""The Edgar Cayce Companion"" from the A.R.E. Press.Q.- How may I better understand myself, time and space?A.- The ""application"" brings consciousness to the individual and it must be of an ""individual"" application for an entity to ""gain"" the consciousness. Such lessons may be gained from reading ""Tertium Organum"".Seek, and ye shall find....."
2,dissapointing,"The book came from amazon took almost a month which is far too long compared to similar sites, the sleeve was dirty and looked like it had been sitting in a warehouse dusty corner for years, that wasn't the disappointing part the book has no images just recipes, for an amateur cook it's very annoying and hard especially for new dishes I have never tried. Probably wouldn't recommend it but there are a few good recipes such as fresh ravioli etc"
2,Not something I would buy again,I find that while I love the front closure bras because of having fibro this one just isn't quite as comfortable as some of the others. The straps never have felt really comfortable and for this reason I won't buy another. I also feel that the posture support it claims is not really there.
1,Ouch,You get what you pay for. In this case it is a very uncomfortable bra. It reminds me of something my mom probably women wore in 1958.
3,Good fit,Was a good fit but think a DD cup would have been better but non was available in my size also wish there was other colors
3,Ms. BC Tibbs,I found this bra to be a pretty good bra. I got what I paid for!! The only prob lem I had with it was the material under my arme kept rolling up. I found it to be very comfortable. A whole lot more than my other bras.1 White Front-Hook T-Back Bra by Instant ShapingAmazon Order #1o5-9523896-38-0017
2,Insightful but too soapbox-ish for me,"The book came out swinging! Pow! Strong statements and serious accusations about how ""the man"" wants to keep us all dumb. Ok, you've got my attention. But it never really stopped. I understand that the Internet is all about discussions... about disempowered folks trying to break free from corporate oppression. Now what? Maybe I would have found out if I finished the book. But I couldn't... it just became too difficult to hear so much ranting... almost yelling! It's bulletinboard roots style is showing. However, I would recommend this book to quite a few ex-managers I can think of."
1,prepare to be under-whelmed,"A tour de blase that left me wishing I could get back the time I wasted reading it. The authors seem self-absorbed and must think that everything they say is really cute and dripping with insight. Maybe ""cluetrain"" would have been prophetic had it come out 5 years earlier, but I was left feeling ""so what?"" and ""that's all you could think of?"". And if it was all they could think of, they were successful at delivering in the most stupefyingly annoying way. Reminds me of some over-the-hill pot-bellied geezers who hobble with their guitar to the stage with the assistance of walkers and beller ""ARE U READY TO ROCK?"" and fall down. A joke compared to truly visionary and skillfully crafted works like Gilder's ""Telecosm"", this sad drivelly rag should be propelled to an obscure cut-out bin and their website disbanded."
3,A clue too much,"Chapter 1 which I read at cluetrain was incisive, thought-provoking and entertaining. I bought the book on the strength of it. Trouble is the tedious repetition of the rest of the book. For me, Locke's writing is top class, that of the others, fairly pedestrian."
5,Turning Marketing on its Head,"Read this book, then read this book again. If you think the world we live in is still about big companies spoon feeding us what we want...WAKE UP! The web has changed everything and these four authors offer clear insights about how to cope. Throughout the Cluetrain, you will read things that somewhere deep inside you already knew to be ture, but corporate America has fought hard to supress. Buy this book and help put the future of your company and career back on track."
2,I'm Sorry...,"This book was incredibly naive and juvenile in it's tone and I just couldn't help but wonder if these guys have some kind of victim complex. They make a few interesting points, but the way the message is delivered (and I agree with most of the other negative review on this site in that the real messages could have been done in 20 pages) just makes you not want to listen. There is a real us/them tone to the whole thing... Reminds me of when I used to be a Teamster (no offense to my Union brethren...)"
2,Interesting but repetitive,"This book definitely opens up one's eyes to the way the internet is changing business and communication. It puts into words what many of us have understood, but up until now have been unable to articulate. The problem I have with this book is the tone that assumes that no one else is smart enough to have figured this out and their continual references to ""scared middle-aged white men"" is boderline militant feminism and racism. One last comment is the fact that they act like they have all the answers and the way current business is run is all wrong. Well companies have been doing pretty good long before this book came out, so they are doing something right. Lastly the way they promote openess to information amongst people and companies borders on communism. ""Let information be free"" they cry. Well why don't the authors donate the money they make from the book to the readers... Just a thought."
1,Pardon me while I get a new AOL account.,"For anyone who was actually around when IRC was just starting to take off c.1993, this book from its onset takes on a tone that reeks more of an AOLer than someone who even knows what it's like to dialup to a unix box. There were some interesting conclusions about the nature of relationships in B2C, but nothing deep or inspiring. The writing style is more like a rant than an actual intellectual discussion. Sentences and ideas are strung together like something out of Walden Pond. Skip the book and get a subscription to Fast Company or something."
2,The book is more entertainment than anything else,"While there are some interesting points in this book, it seems that the authors have spent more energy on ""sounding cool and fresh"" than on writing a book that can give interesting thoughts and insights. It is very annoying when sometimes, page after page is filled with text that would fit more in a poem than in a book about business.Furthermore, while the authors do have some interesting points, there is no valid research behind their thoughts. Basically, they have sat together and brainstormed some ideas, which they have then put in this book."
2,Ad nauseaum,"I get the point. I got the point at about the 35th entry in the 95 points. After that, reading this book was like listening to a Dennis Leary monologue. If my college English professor were reading this, he'd give it an F for 'Fluff'."
3,"Workers of the world unite, rant, and rave - feel better ?","Long on hyperbole, short on answers and advice. The cluetrain manefasto is a great wedge book to open up your eyes and think about the new econmy. The 95 theses are terrific, I only wish that the text dealt more with the implications of these theses.Instead the text rages on about how the status quo is going to be overwhelmed by the new economy. It is fine to rant, however, there is little value add after you have vented your frustration. You will feel better after reading Cluetrain but you will still not have a clue.If you want to do something in the new economy, go to the website and print out the theses. Use the time you would spend reading the book addressing the issues raised by the theses."
1,Can I get my money back?,"This repetative, poorly written book was a waste of money, offering little in the way of useful insights. In the book, the authors constantly slam Corporate America for overpromisinng and undelievering -- which is exactly what this book does. The dust jacket promises much, but this book never delivers anything valuable."
2,"If you've been asleep for the last four years, read this","I think the target audience is somebody who completely missed out on the late nineties, but who would like a very light read to understand the change in openness and freedom in conversations that most folks now take for granted. There's not a lot of content here -- you can skim about 10% of the book and get seemingly 99% of the content. If you're really ""clueless"", hit the web version instead and save the effort of grabbing this book."
2,The Clueless Manifesto,"I was really disappointed with this book. It seems more like a plea than an analysis. It's obvious that the authors would prefer a world where they can just work at what they think is fun, chat with folks online and not deliver anything that the customer cares about.They do make a few good points, but, unfortunately, that's overshadowed by the incredibly stupid remarks that they toss in frequently. It's very clear that they have no idea what management is really like, or what the real purpose of business is. It's too bad.My recommendation is not to waste your money. I was hoping for more insights, but what I got was mostly immature garbage."
1,same as it ever was,"One of my employees bought some copies of this book for his department and I was pretty excited to read it, I'd heard about it a lot from him when it was a webpage.I finally got around to reading it, and sorry, it really wasn't that hot. A lot of rhetoric that sounds great, and it may make a lot of managers happier to read this and think they're suddenly savvy 21st century marketers, but I think all in all maybe you should just get the less pretentious Tony Robbins book that this so desperately wants to be. That's the category this book fills for me: Books people read to feel smart, that don't really have insights that are as great as they think they are.After all, if this book really was revolutionary, would it really be selling to the very businesspeople it aims to educate as much as it is?"
1,""". . . fatuous . . . buffoonery . . .""",Four dot.com gasbags make a couple of simple-minded observations and then pound them into the ground with sledge hammers for 190 excruciatingly tedious pages. Don't waste your time or money on this fatuous exercise in internet buffoonery.
3,"wonderful message, excessively long","The main two points of this book are these:#1: Any business is for, by, and of people.#2: The internet re-empowers individuals to take advantage of #1.The message of this work is awesome and right on. Unfortunately, the book is about 8 times as long as it needs to be. Created as a series of essays by four authors and pundits, this book gets irritatingly repetitive by halfway through. You'll wonder, ""How many different ways can these guys think of to say the same thing?"" The original 95 theses from their www.cluetrain.com website is too little to get the whole message, but 183 pages is too much. This would have been perfect as a 20 page article.If you buy this book, read the first chapter. If you ""get it"", then skip right to the last chapter."
3,Interesting thoughts but repetitive content,"'The Cluetrain Manifesto' consists of some interesting thoughts from the 4 authors, but the content tend to be repetitive thru out the book (given the 4 authors may have similar point of views). I believe it would be more appropriate to have the content condensed & published in magazines. But I do enjoy the blunt writing style, especially the chapters about the evolving role of marketing in the business world."
5,Worth both the Time and Money,"Very good book. It had my attention the whole way through it. It offers a unique perspective of what the Internet has done to change the landscape of 'traditional' business. Their words need to be heard by those running today's businesses, agree (with them) or not. I happen to agree with much of what they say."
4,Re-think before you Re-tool,"A great book for those that want to come to some conclusions about social media and a web-driven world before they start down a misaligned and/or ineffective path. This book, written almost a decade ago, helps establish the new ground rules for community and conversation (including marketing and advertising) in a transcontinental-internet-connected world. I love things that make me think, that compel me to fill margins with thoughts and notes. This book did just that."
4,Markets are conversations,"Having grown up with high-speed internet as an expected must have, this book serves as an interesting reminder of the days I have missed. Multiplayer games, cross-referencing product review on web forums, asking other internet users for advice on products, all the things that seem natural today are in many ways changing the rules of the marketing game, and Cluetrain is all about this dynamic: markets are conversations. Broadcast media is once again being replaced by an older strategy of person-to-person contact, instead of a one way marketing stream.Some of the information is slightly outdated, some of the sections are plain wacky, but it's an interesting work nonetheless, especially if you're into marketing."
3,"Very insightful, but very repetetive....","This book discusses some of the fundamental foundations of business and how the Internet has once again returned us to these foundations. It is very anti-establishment.I enjoyed the insights. They definitely got me thinking. But the text was very, very repetitive in driving home its points. But the text was very, very repetitive in driving home its points. I found myself skipping pages because I had already read the same thing in the last chapter.I would not recommend this book to my friends or colleagues, but I would gladly discuss what the book is about with them. It is quite interesting."
3,Good not great.,"This book was insightful at times and over the top often. The book gives a good look at changes that need to take place at the heart of every business and why this is the case. The Internet is for communication. As this book gets older some of the things they observed early are coming true, while others are not. A good read, but slow and repetitive at times."
1,Tulips,"This book is useful only if you want to understand the delusions of true believers in the Internet mania. Otherwise, don't bother. As dated as Y2K."
3,outdated,Good Overview of where things are coming from and a good couple insights. Concepts are not outdated but some of the information is.
4,work fine for me,"These work fine for me. I had purchased both, these 3/4 length as well as the full length ones. The reason for the 4 stars (vs. 5) is that I like the full length better (in shoes that provide the extra room needed)"
2,Too bulky,"While the product itself is sound, it's much too bulky to fit into all my existing shoes. Basically, I'll have to upgrade my entire shoe collection and get something wider or longer in order for these to fit."
1,hurt my feet more,"I really wanted to like these 3/4 orthodic inserts, I wanted pain relief from having flat feet, and based on the reviews, it seemed promising, however i should have read the negative reviews more closely. They are really bulky and while the arch seems sturdy, it is way too hard, and uncomfortable, after wearing it for one day, I wish I had not purchased them, my feet hurt more! so i am back to the 3/4 dr sholls 6 dollar inserts I purchased at walmart. they relieve the pain a little, im still looking for a good pair of inserts."
3,"Good, nothing great","I have plantar fascitis and was hoping to be able to mold this to fit high arches. I still haven't figured out how to do that- I tried boiling and bending them but it didn't seem to want to bend. When I have them in my shoes, I can feel they are there, but when my weight is on them, they just seem to flatten out since there's no actual material keeping the arch there (just hard plastic bend upwards). They are better than nothing, but not as good as orthotics from the walking company or doctor."
1,Useless - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The things are ABSURDLY too wide - makes my shoes look like clown shoes - what a stupid product. It seems that the footbed was just modeled after a man's foot. These things are sitting on the floor, totally useless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Too big for Asian lady ?,"i am wearing US 7 shoes and i order the insole according to the shoes size, ie. women US7-8. When i received the product, it is too wide and too long, i cant use it at all ... not sure if this is not suitable for asian lady's feet ... ?"
4,SPENCO Arch Supports,"I had some foot trouble and my foot doctor started me with a pair of these SPENCO Arch Supports, but he warned me that they were temporary. I found them on the Amazon.com website for less than half of what the doctor charged me and bought two pair. My feet are better now and I no longer need the arch supports. These saved my feet and saved me cash..!!!"
1,No rigidity means no support,"I ordered a pair of these Spenco orthotic arch supports after reading all the great reviews.What a disappointment! I don't know if they've changed the design recently, but the plastic arch support is so soft and flexible you can squash it flat with your hands. Of course, when you put your full body weight on it, it flattens out completely, meaning there's virtually no arch support at all.If you have low arches or flat feet, my advice is to look elsewhere for an orthotic with more rigid arch support."
5,An inexpensive cure for pronation,"As I have gotten older, I've found that I'm beginning to over-pronate, leading to pain on the inside of my knee, especially during lateral movements during workouts. Before spending the money on custom orthotics, I decided to try these. They have been immensely helpful; the pain in my left knee is gone and the right has improved considerably. They fit into my athletic shoes easily, without removing the lining, and don't make my shoes overly tight. I have only used them in my gym shoes so I don't know if they would fit as well in street shoes. I have a high arch and these inserts give me the support I need."
2,Not bad....if you're putting these in tennis shoes,"I bought these to put in my work shoes -- plain black flats. The problem is, now with them inserted, the height of the orthotic makes my shoes not fit worth a flip. They won't even stay on my heel now because I can't put my foot deep enough in them. So, in short? Useless."
5,Have used these for years,"Helps my arch problem and always comfortable, my husband also has a pair and he uses for his work shoes and for running shoes. They last for years and are affordable.. we have used them since the early 1990's."
2,Not long enough,"I ordered the 3/4 to try them, as I always use the full length. I didn't like the 3/4 length because if you put it in your shoe with the insole of the shoe left in it takes up too much room. If you take the insole out there is room in the shoe, but you don't have any sole or cushion in the front of the shoe, and the transition from the orthotic to the sole of the shoe is uncomfortable. So I returned them and reordered the full length instead. Other than the length, they feel and do the job as the full length. Oh, by the way, I love that you can mold them to your specification."
3,Nice Arch,The arch part of this does help if you have arch pain. The trouble is that it is a little bulky and won't fit in most shoes.
4,"This textbook is a good reader, but not the best reference.","This recent offering in the field of Esperanto textbooks for English speakers tries to fill many roles. It gives a history of the language from its introduction in 1887 to the late 1980's. It also has a textbook for learning the language and a small, but good dictionary. Perhaps its greatest strength is that it combines these other elements with a selection of short readings. If you are only going to buy one textbook on Esperanto then Teach Yourself Esperanto or Step By Step In Esperanto would be a more complete choice. However, you should strongly consider this book as a second one to complement either of those."
4,Sensible approach to learning Esperanto,"This is my favorite beginning Esperanto book. The vocabulary choices are good, with more difficult words being introduced in a logical manner (not all at once!) The excercises are at a good gradient - not too hard -- and the words a new Esperantist would need are introduced early on.Within just a few days I was able to correspond with Esperanto speakers from all over the world.I highly recommend the language and this book!"
4,A good choice for your _second_ Esperanto book...,"This book is divided into four parts. First is an extended essay on the language and the movement, past, present and future--good information for the newcomer. Second is a ten-lesson ""basic course"" that covers the gramar and hits the high points of usage--the lessons are acceptable, but not outstanding. Third--and the real strength of the book--is an intermediate-level reader of texts, with notes and commentary. Last of all, a word list that makes up a reasonable ""my first Esperanto dictionary"" before buying, say, the Wells dictionary. There are better choices for a first book on the language--in particular, the Teach Yourself entry--but I think this book is hard to beat for the _second_ book you put on your shelf, to expand your skills and deepen your understanding. That's how I'm using it right now, and I'm quite satisfied."
2,A Major Disappointment,"The Bible series is one of my favorite series of technical books due to it's usual great presentation of the data and the sheer volume of information presented. I'm a very careful shopper and usually research the books I'm going to buy. However, due to the high quality of many of the other books in this series I purchased this one on faith. This turned out to be a big mistake as this book is poorly laid out, covers some topics to a depth that seems ridiculous and other topics are just barely touched. There are not nearly enough examples and the chapter on ADO.Net is woefully inadequate. The book works as a high level overview, but there are much better books out there that work even better as a high level overview. If you want a better book then look at Wrox's ""Beginning Visual C#"" ISBN: 0764543822 or Wrox's ""Professional C#, Second Edition"" ISBN: 0764543989."
3,"You may buy, but look around first","This is my 6th book on C#. I have hard core C++/Java back ground and use most of the programming languages. I got this book to use it as a dictionary or desk reference. The book I bought does not have a CD, and the site for bonus companion for sample code is missing. I was directed to Technical Support by the authors. Thanks. If you are my style, prefer to see in depth commenting or code discussion, then don't buy. Buy only you know and used these dll/namespace/keywords/interface/delegation/indexers, would be a quick guide for you. Goodies: codes looked simple ch 7,ch 16, ch 33."
4,Very Good! But a cd for the fan only!,"6 great song(rarity song)!!! and 2 video, Wishmaster (Original version), Sleepwalker (Heavy version), Passion And The Opera, Nightguest, A Return To The Sea, Once Upon A Troubadour, 2 videos!, Sleeping Sun, Sacrement Of Wilderness(Live), if your are not a fan of Nightwish, is not a cd to buy !! just buy Wishmaster and Oceanborn first and if you like it, buy this album..."
2,Did they change the formula???,"My dogs used to eat this and it did wonders for their coat. BUT they were regurgitating it so i stopped. I thought I would give it another shot but even with a gradual transition, my dogs never got used to it nor stopped having loose stools.I notice it is a much smaller kibble than the older formula AND smells absolutely horrible now, like s--t, no joke.Nature's Variety is usually tops when it comes to ingredients and manufacturing guidelines but can't tell you what happened here."
4,Excellent starting point on this dynasty,"""Licentious or bigoted, noble or ignoble, there has seldom been a dull Bourbon,"" wrote Nancy Mitford. The Bourbon kings of France and Navarre ruled for more than two centuries and made France the greatest power in Europe -- but they also ended the monarchy in France, first by being one of the major causes of the Revolution and then by refusing to rule by constitution after their post-Napoleonic restoration. Seward is a Paris-born, Cambridge-trained historian who succeeds in combining scholarship with lively readability."
5,Sani-Flush,Have used this product since 1970 and have found none better! Have contacted manufacturer and it is no longer available. Sorry to see it go! Does anyone have a replacement?
5,Amazing jazz...,"This album is good. I wish all the original albums from which this one was complied were available on CD.If you get this CD for no other reason, take a listen to Road Time Shuffle, which was the title track of a another album by the same band. Road Time is a fantastic chart that was played amazingly well and recorded live. This is probably the best recorded live jazz performance I've ever heard. This band was on fire, with some of the best jazz talent at that time in the band.I don't understand why Toshiko and this band haven't gotten more attention. Take a listen and tell me if I'm wrong."
4,Works,I purchased this to replace my current element in my water heater. I feel it works just fine and no issues. The reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because when I was tightening down the power screws the plastic felt cheap and moved a lot. Needless to say I didn't tighten the screws to tight or I probably would have broke the plastic housing.
5,Gorgeous worth every cent.,"A lot of these card guards are not made well. This one flirts with being ""very expensive"". The photo here doesn't do it justice. Wonderful present for any amateur to pro card players. I got this for quite a ""princess"" and she is particularly picky and hard to please and she loved this. Good solid weight, thick, bright, enamel paint it has it all. I don't have one negative, would have happily paid twice as much as I did for this. You won't be sorry."
4,"For the price, it's amazing.","Not that I'm a bit expert, but I've been using this 3/4"" Forstner bit to inlay magnets in maple, and it just doesn't seem to dull. I've used it in a drill press, in a cordless drill, and even in a pair of vise-grips for cleaning up. I've paid more for Philips head bits. It's dead on straight, with NO wobble, hasn't tarnished a bit in 4 months, and makes me happy every time that I chuck it up. In a drill, I mean. I didn't eat it."
3,Jerri from Little Rock,"This is a sci-fi movie which I usually do not like. An interesting premise, a new unapproved drug tested on an innocent bystander by a huge drug corporation. I liked it but thought that the editing was not very smooth, obviously a foreign production. I had to watch it about three times before I caught all the jumps, which had at first viewing seemed to not make sense. I bought it to see Stephen Tompkinson's performance which was good in some places and seemed melodramatic in other places. Of course, the story of traveling back and forth between the living and the dead made it unbelievable. The director was also the writer and this was his first effort at directing which probably accounts for some of this."
1,Makes Me Sick watching this Garbage.......,"In a few short Min's of watching this TRASH it made sick,other than 1 kid who at least seems to be trying to act like he has a disability by ""Moaning""the other kids to Me seem more like they are just making fun of ppl -w- disabilities & that makes me Very Up-set,I worked at group home -w- ppl who did suffer awful conditions & to me this movie is mocking them & I don't find that funny at all but plenty of young kids I bet would find disabled ppl funny even Sadder IMO & they should go volunteer,spend time -w- them & there family's & re-think what they think is Funny,I'm glad I didn't waste Money on this garbage,more hurtful than funny."
5,Touching,This story is touching and true. This book lets the reader into the mind of a person fighting a parilizing disease. To have fear of confrentation and fear of rejection all at once! wow! a must read! another great book about a man with Muscular dystrophy is:Not All Prisons Have Bars
4,"Funny as hell, and beautifully moving","A ""little"" movie definitely worth watching. The cast are all pros, and while the story is a bit predictable at the end, it is most definitely worth your time. 'Nough said."
5,excellent story,This is a fast moving story with issues that remain timely. The characters are intersting and the images are powerful. I couldn't put it down!
5,This is a GREAT book!,"I finally received my copy of this book and immediately made some home made chili powder and had friends over for dinner the next weekend. Although some have made statments on how complex the recipes are, he is famous for a reason. AND, he has chosen to share some of his recipes that have made him and his restaurant famous."
3,Toboggan,Loved this especially the strap to secure our little guy. Problem was it came cracked and it was a Christmas gift. They we out so we couldn't get a replacement in time. Amazon was great and credited me and told me I could reorder when they were available. Got to love Amazon!!
3,Where's the rope in the picture??,We like the sled especially for the price and think it will be useful this winter helping our 2 year old not to fall back when pulled along. However the rope in the photo was not included. Just kind of deceiving. Luckily my husband is handy and will be able to take care of this no problem.
3,Padded Seat?,"When the item arrived, it did not have a padded seat as described. Also, I think the cord intended to pull the boggon is far too short. However, since I gave this item as a gift, I can't comment on actual usage. Finally, the item is shipped in an Amazon shipping box, with no additional packaging. I had to turn the boggon into a ""gift boggon"" filling it with other gifts and wrapping it like a gift basket."
2,Not at all as advertised,The sled that I received does not look like the photo at all! The one I received is bigger and less supportive. I purchased it for my 9 month old so I am hoping I can pad the sides up enough to allow me to pull him through the snow.
1,tippy in snow deeper than an inch,"I was very hopeful about his sled, since it seemed a good size and ensured my two year old wouldn't be falling backward off of the sled. It works fine if I'm pulling her along on the ice, or an inch or less of snow, so we use it on the sidewalks around town. But it seems to not spread out weight evenly - or something - and so it gets bogged down in any depth of snow and just tips over on its side, making for a very unhappy toddler."
2,Plastic has a crack in it just after opening out of box,"The price is good on this sled, but the plastic cracked on the front of the sled already and we haven't even taken it outside, my boy only sat in it so I don't know if it came with the crack or if it happened after he at in it. I don't have the time to return it either."
3,WARNING !!! THEY ONLY SHIP IN SETS OF 6,"I thought I was buying two toboggans for my grandkids. When the 4 X 2 X 2 box arrived, I had no idea that there were 12 toboggans. On the Amazon web page, down deep in the Product Description, it states ""Packed 6 per poly bag.""Deerso would refund my total bill, including their $11 shipping costs.HOWEVER, IT WOULD COST ME $146 to return them to Deerso, more than I paid for the 12 toboggans. I did not request Amazon to pay for return shipment costs, even though Deerso states they are not responsible for the web page development.I am going to sell them on EBay."
4,great toddler sled,Great toddler sled! Sturdy and offers protection for toddler sitting in sled! Great for pulling child in snow - not for sliding.
4,"Ordered 2, but one was different","One sled arrived as pictured. The other came at a later date(back ordered ?). I didn't open the box immediately (it was for a birthday present). I assumed it was the same sled as it was in the same type box etc. When it came time to wrap the birthday present, here it was a different sled, similar but with flanges on each side and not quite the room to sit. I was disappointed. :("
2,Tips over in deeper snow - Crying bundles of joy,"We live in an area where we can get over 8 inches of snow. When it gets that deep, this product tends to tip over.We've used this for when our kids were like 1 year+ and we had to go around the yard and pack down the snow in a path or else it would tip over, putting our little bundles of joy face down in the snow!If you're only going on a packed snow paths, it's perfectly fine, but we go on the sidewalk then into the fresh snowfall in the backyard, and it never fails to tip over crying, freezing toddlers.Really surprised it's not mentioned in other reviews."
2,"Tips easily, too small","Based on another review, I got this boggon for my 3 year old and 17 month old. It's way too small for both of them. It tips over very easily and the cord is too short as other reviewers mentioned. Neither one of them felt secure in it. I don't think it'll get much use and will probably end up collecting dust in the attic while we search for something more suitable."
5,GREAT,"I love this sled my daughter is 3 months and i put her in it,,, with a pillow behind her but its a great but"
3,Like it but no padded seat,"The item I received is just red plastic. No padded foam seat. Overall, it's a very simple design - molded plastic with a simple ""seat belt"" threaded through 2 slits in the back. My son loves this. We haven't had much snow yet, so I pull him around the carpet in the house. He loves it. He's in the waddler stage, and he likes to stand up and push this. The back is the perfect height for him. As other reviewers have said, the rope is pretty short for an adult to stand up and pull the sled along."
1,Good sled for wee little ones,"I got a picture of my daughter in law pulling her 2 littlle girls on this sled, they were all smiles so I guess I got my monies worth."
1,Poor Quality,"Ordered this sled for my 4 month old's first winter and was very excited to receive it! We got it and it had nice high sides and supported him well when the buckle was attached, however, the minute he squirmed to look around, the buckle let go and he fell out face first into the snow. I am really not impressed with a produce designed for an infant that would have the SAFETY harness be so unsafe."
1,spoiled by the last chapter,"Boteach's advices are often presented in pretentious manner, but many of them are quite reasonable (not to say too obvious). No-one would argue that parents should avoid fostering their children's intellectual curiosity, or discussing with them such topics as dignity of every human being.In the last chapter (about God), Boteach disregards other religions and world-views in favour of Judaism. To make things worse, he includes lenghty political tirade praising America for being ""quick to take its vision of faith, democracy, and government to all corners of the globe, by force, if necessary"". I cannot understand why the author's political statement found its place in a book about parent-children relationship."
5,"Mystical Sheep, Perfect Ears, and an Extraordinary Adventure","This is the first book of Murakami's I've ever read, and if they're all this fun and bizarre, it won't be the last book I read. I can't say I fully understand this book (in fact, I'd be pretty suspicious of anyone who said they did completely understand it!) but it was fully enjoyable. The ending was certainly unexpected, it definitely left me wondering what would happen to the protagonist.An ordinary man experiencing an extraordinary adventure ... his quest to find a mysterious sheep ... if I had to describe this book to someone who's never read it I wouldn't be able to do it without explaining the entire book! All I can say is this: READ THIS BOOK! You won't regret it!"
3,"Good, but not Murakami's best","The book is good, but not as good as Murakami's Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (WBC). WBC is a thrill to read and the writing is beautiful, and after reading it I was compelled to go and buy ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" . This book is good as well, but I am disappointed because the tone and tenor of the book is very similar to WBC. I just wish there was more variety to Murakami's writing."
2,Poor Story,"I previously read 'The Wind Up Bird Chronicles' which I thought was great. So I knew what to expect with the 'Sheep Chase' but I was terriblly disappointed. The writing seemed amateurish throughout most of the novel. The 'Sheep Chase' has characters that seemed to just drop out of the book suddenly for no plausible reason (The Girl with the Ears). And the strange power of her ears is never fully explained or even demonstrated in the book. The first chapter of the novel doesn't really seem to have anything to do with the rest of the story. Several of the characters seem to do things that are 'out of character'. For example, the mysterious 'Boss' Assistant' who is so powerful and rich (with a host of servants) and demanding agrees to take care of the protagonist's cat. This just seemed somewhat peculiar. Also, the 'Sheep Man' is one of the most unconvincing characters I've ever run into in a book - even one of this type. Overall this is definitely not one of Murakami's best."
2,Wild Sheep Chase,Recommended by a reading maniac friend.Start was good but it's been all downhill from there.Very disappointed.Would not recommend.
2,What's a sheep chase good for?,"The writing style to start with felt very ordinary and not extremely imaginative hardly managed to keep my interest in the story line. It takes some time to adjust with it.And eventually it does, it starts flowing imagination wise. The descriptions become more capturing. But what for. Not being able to explain why chase the sheep, is there any other reason, except for the obvious reason - to write for the pleasure it gives.It left me feelin cheated. Empty. And not wanting to read this book ever again - I thought maybe I ought to just in case I had missed any page!"
1,too strange,"Both in English and Japanese, I find Murakami's writing too strange to enjoy. I not only cannot relate to the stories, but they are just too whacky. I don't know how people can rave about him as one of the rising stars of Japanese writing. Frankly, I think it is a disgrace. There are so many more talented and wonderful Japanese writers out there - Endo, Matsumoto, Natsume, Miyabe, Takagi...."
4,A minor 'Wind Up Bird Chronicle',"I came to this book fresh from reading Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, which entranced me. Whilst I enjoyed this also, it is more lightweight, and also more linear than W-UBC.I loved the idea of having one's personality enslaved by a malevolent sheep ('en-sheeped'?), but on the whole, the book is somehow lacking. I found some of the more obvious Americanisms of the tranlations irritating. But then, I suppose I would do as a limey...A great author, but not his best work"
4,A Wild Sheep Chase = goodness,"Haruki Murakami hits another home run with A Wild Sheep Chase... Well, maybe an in field home run. His effortlessly fluid voice and cross-sensual similes will satisfy your brain. I will say though, The Wind-up Bird Chronicles was a little more ripe than A Wild Sheep Chase. I'm not sure if it's the writing or the English translation (Wind-up Bird translated by Jay Rubin; A Wild Sheep Chase translated by Alfred Birnbaum). If you want to read your first Murakami novel, I'd recommend The Wind-up Bird Chronicles to start. Also, his short stories are equally cathartic."
5,Murakami does it again!,"Fabulous! Picturesque, dark, with much of the same melancholy as ""Norwegian Wood,"" and told in the same offhand style. Murakami is a novelist with the heart and style of a poet, and the dry wit of a satirist. His stories, told in this loose, comfortable style seem to slip lightly along, until you are sucker-punched with tragedy or insight, related in the same voice. Once again, I can only describe Mr. Murakami's work as deeply haunting and memorable"
4,Fantastically Odd,"This gem of a novel was required reading for a world literature class I took. I waited until the last minute to read it, but it ended up being a breeze to get through because it was so fantastically odd. I would not be the least bit surprised to find out that Murakami was a Stanley Kubrick fan. I fully intend to check out the rest of his work."
4,weaving new fairytales with the mundane,"murakami almost wrote a flawless novel in A WILD SHEEP CHASE. the typical murakami elements were there: a centralized character confused, but yet accepting of their own mediocrity. throw in some telepathic supporting cast, a mythical/mystical creature that supercedes space and time, and the sound of one hand clapping. it's the latter zen-like quality that takes murakami's craft above other modern day cult writers like amis and welsh. but in this book, i found that the quiet, reflective qualities helped create its biggest weakness: scale. maybe i am too used to western literature's climax. but i felt that the peak was a little too close to the end of the book. still, 4 out of 5 is damn good. i will read it again."
4,Who Knew Sheep Were So Interesting?,"While I didn't like this novel as well as IQ84, which I read first, I did enjoy the novel. It was especially interesting to see how the newer novel emerged from similar narrative techniques and to some extent similar themes. For Murakami ""beginners,"" this novel gives glimpses into a world that sits in the nexus between reality and fantasy, which is right where the author would want us. The story does include a wild sheep chase. Forget about geese!"
3,A Wild Sheep Chase,"I didn't think this was as good as the other two Murakami books I've read (1Q84 and Kafka on the Shore), perhaps because it is an early work of Murakami's and he hadn't developed his combination of fantasy and realism that made those other books so intriguing. The first part of the book was not very interesting and didn't seem to tie in very well with the main plot involving the sheep. I didn't get the ending--I'm feeling maybe I'll reread the book and see if I missed something."
4,"Peculiar, different, reading experience",Murakami's gift is a powerful imagination to conceive magical surrealism and crackerjack observations out of our daily drab ordinary reality
2,Too slow and weird for its own good,"This book was so unwieldy I had to force myself to read it. I realize this is probably the Japanese version of magical realism, but for some reason it was a tedious read. I think part of the reason why it was slow is the typical Japanese insistence on describing boredom and the mood of ""what good can possibly happen"" a little too well.The only other Murakami novel I have read as of now is Norwegian Wood, and that is a wonderful breath of fresh air in comparison. In fact, Norwegian Wood is one of my favorite novels in general - check that out if you are just starting with Murakami."
2,Major Disapointment,"This book contained far to many loose ends, extended descriptions of scenery, unrelated characters, to be a satisfying read. Even when the plot should have been reaching a climax, you'd have to drudge through three pages describing how much snow there is. There were some beautiful passages, but the story was ridiculous, and not in the good way. I'd be willing to give Murakami another chance, but on the whole, I consider this book to have been pretty boring."
4,Exactly what I needed,"Easy to install and resolved the issue I had with horizontal lines being printed on the edge of every printed page. Lower price would be nice, based on the cost of new color printers."
2,"Yes it's a multicolored tambourine, but it's not the item pictured!","I ordered this Hohner Kid's Tambourine along with several other instruments for my daughter's preschool after her teacher explained that the school didn't allocate any funding for music instruments for the classroom. Yes it's a tambourine. Yes it's multicolored. However it is not the item pictured and I'll have to admit that this item's build quality looks far cheaper than the tambourine in the photo. The item I received is blue, red, and yellow with a clear plastic drumhead. On the flip side it was relatively inexpensive and if I wasn't trying to get these instruments to the classroom by tomorrow I would have returned this item."
3,Tie Down Engineering,"I don't know who told you Tie Down Engineering was out of business but he was totally wrong. They had a fire last fall in their axle plant, but the other 4 or 5 buildings were not damaged and they are very much in business.[...]"
4,Architectural graphic standards,"Very good book, it has a lot of useful information. Would be good if there was more metric conversions"
3,Don't Be Fooled by the Enclosed CD-Rom,"While the Architectural Graphics Standards book is as good a reference as always, the enticement of a CD-Rom is a false promise. You have to purchase an unlock code to access the Rom. Said access code is available for a fee of $425.00. That wasn't disclosed before I purchased it."
3,the encyclopedia for architects,"I find this book is so powerful, because I can find any things for a architect want to know from this book. I call this book is the encyclopedia for me. I really want to buy this book, but unfortunately, I am a Australian architect, and we are using metric unit (metre), and it is quite trouble to understand the inch dimension for us. So editor, Could you please publish a ""Architectural Graphic Standards in Metric"" in the following edition, please."
2,Ambush,"In ordering this movie, I was hoping to see something in the scale of ""Cold War"". That expectation was soon to be misconceived as the movie's opening 15 minutes was much less than expected. ""A big sweeping war Epic"" it was not. ""Packed with rousing battle scenes"" hmmm..No!! The only large battle scene, if you could call it that, was at the end.The movie was however well shot and well acted. It was let down by the weak plot and very average attempt at portraying the Finnish Army struggle against a superior numbered force. It showed nothing of the expertise of Finnish troops defending their own country and there knowledge of local terrain that was a distinct tactical advantage to them against the Russians.I was not impressed with this movie, it could have been so much more."
2,Locking hubs,I ordered for my vehicle and they didn't fit so I had to return them at my expense. Total BS.
5,A product every car owner should have,"The product was exactly what I observed in offer to sell. The wheel locks fit my vehicle perfectly and look outstanding. No one is going to take the wheels off that car without the corresponding McGard key. Excellent price, fast shipping. Plan to buy another set for my other car."
5,mcgard wheel locks,i've been using mcgard wheel locks since the 1980's and they are very good.the price from amazon was 1/2 what others wanted. good investment!
5,Great buy!,"Great purchase, I never have a problem with these discs, always work for me, and I got them very fast. Great product!"
5,Great so far!,"I got a new Panasonic DVD/VCR combo with DVD burner, so I researched blank discs and this seemed the best choice of brand. I have Memorex blank CDs for my computer and they are terrible, I end up with more coasters than good discs so (along with the bad Memorex DVD reviews) I knew to avoid those. These DVDs are working perfectly so far. The picture quality is good, and I love the movie spool design on them.Update: Not a bad one in the bunch. These DVDs are more expensive than plain white but I like how much nicer these look."
4,These Always Work Well,I like to put old home videos and TV movies onto DVD. These Verbatim movie discs always work well. I would recommend them to everyone who is transferring video to a DVD.
1,"Coasters are good for drinks, useless for data storage","I bought these disks for image file backup.Every single disc in the spindles of 25 DID NOT work.They would neither format nor accept any file transfers from my computer.The entire package was useless.Verbatim discs around 3 years ago had this same problem when they changed their disc production factories. Then, after so many complaints, they did some serious and effective problem shooting.It looks like the same ugly problem is back.When they work, Verbatim discs are the best. These discs are a bad return to the days of error-ridden production.Avoid and look for other media for storage."
4,On a whim...,"On a whim, I bought this ring for myself because I thought it was different from the usual assortment. Throughly enjoyed it!"
3,Light and Sometimes Humorous,"Offers practical test taking tips and is a nice first read for college students. If you enjoyed this book, you'll surely like ""Major in Success"", by Patrick Combs. I teach at a University and this book changes lives."
2,Not that great,I paid $2 & felt ripped off. This is the worst study guide/self help book ever. Don't waste your time.
1,do not buy,"I was not satisfied with this product at all. I paid $5 and I got what I paid for. The very first time I plugged in my mp3 player the sound quality was awful. My music sounded like it was coming through a walkie-talkie. there was no bass and very little treble, even after turning both up. Also, I had to crank up the sound on my car and my mp3 player. After about 2 minutes of playing around I knew I bought junk. This product did not let me enjoy the music. It's in the trash."
1,Implausible and inaccurate to the point of distraction,"This is one of the most implausible, poorly researched books of this sort I have read. Skeet ""rifles""? Quail hunting in Rockies? If you have even a passing familiarity with weapons, hunting, or geography, I suggest you pass on this one. It appears the author did little, if any, research, and just assumed the reader would would share his naivete. Even if you can tolerate a fair amount of fact-stretching, by the end of this novel you will think the author's dramatic license should be revoked. This author needs to do more research, and/or a better editor."
4,Suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride,"Jones' breakneck-paced ""Maximum Velocity,"" takes place in the Colorado mountains near a remote hamlet. Chris Neilson and his wife Matty and their toddler son have just moved there from a California suburb when a relative of Matty's turns up in his red Lamborghini and, after a few deft maneuvers, leaves Chris for dead and takes over his life.From the beginning, Jones manages an off-kilter tension, an unpredictability generated by the Springer character, which grows helter skelter as the novel progresses.Essentially a chase, with a number of outlandish aspects, the novel only flags when Jones pauses to develop character. A former screenwriter, Jones' forte is action and his best character is the larger-than-life villain. Springer is a sadist who enjoys himself, a highly trained CIA killing machine who increases in invincibility as Chris' efforts become more desperate. Suspend your disbelief and you're in for a high-speed roller-coaster of a ride."
3,Not there best collab but still good,"This is a weird one to be honest. I only kept reading because I was waiting for something awesome to happen, and there's a few instances where it does. But overall I felt a little let down story wise, which is more of the spiritual on this go around than the normal sci fi awesomeness, this duo is known for. Art wise moebius does not let you down and there are no instances of rushness or lazyness in his work and infact seems to have really enjoyed himself while drawing this book.A good read but nothing great."
3,"Admire the craft, but not my cup of tea.","I'll be honest, I picked this up based on my love of The Metabarons and some great reviews, and didn't worry to much about what it was about. After reading it, all I can say is ""whuf"". I might have gotten more out of it if I was a philosphy professor like the storie's protagonist, but as a humble member of the seething masses, I was left in the dust while the narative took off on a surreal existential rollercoaster. I risk sounding like a semi-literate baboon here, but I might still have loved it if Moebius had drawn us some crazy aliens or something, but the rather mundane terestrial setting for this book really left nothing to focus on but the obscure religious analogies that, to be perfectly honest, I didn't get. Oh well, I'll just chock this one up to ""lesson learned"" and read some Incal."
3,great for fans,This is a great looking hard hat. I was very pleased with the look of it. The design however is decals and is not painted on hence the 3 star rating.
5,"I may be a kid, but please take my advise!!","This is a romantic emotional read. It shows what familys are for, and what sacrfices people made to defend us in the war. It had me in tears by the end (which is unusual as I can never seem to find deep emotion in normal books),it is as if you have known the characters all your life, and I for one will never take soliders for granted, it told me that being part of a country is like being part of a family, just because we complaine about them dosn't mean they do not have a warm place in our hearts."
5,private peaceful,"Private peacefulReviser Big TonyThis book is a good book if you like to read war books. This book is about the adventures and experiences that a person had when he went to war. The bad thing about this book is that it is a made up story but it seems like it could have actually been somebody's life story.Michael Morpurgo wrote the book and he did a good job at writing it because when he describes the war and some parts of the war, you feel like you are in the book with the characters and fighting with them in the battlefields.The only thing I really didn't like about the book was that it had butterflies on the cover of the book. I thought it made it look like it wasn't going to be one of the better war books, but I was wrong. It was a good book; so don't judge this book by the cover. Pick it up and read it because if you like fiction war books about people's lives then you will like this book."
4,I cant believe it!!!,"I cant believe that this man is still doing his thing. And he never puts out a bad album. Like a fine wine, Joe Sample gets better with age. This album proves it all. And the wonderful voice of Howard Hewett is just the icing on the cake. Thanks Joe for all the good music you have given us with The Crusaders, all all of your solo work. Carmel, Rainbow Seeker, The Hunter, Ashes to Ashes, Invitation. The list goes on and on. Keep giving us more. Once again.....""Real music 4 real music lovers!!!"""
4,More Lizz!!,"I'd probably like this CD more if he had only featured Lizz Wright, instead of her and Howard Hewett. I can't get past the first 5 songs, because I only want to hear Lizz. Anyway, if you're a Joe Sample fan, it's worth the money. By the way, is it me or does ""The Texas Two Step"" start off sounding like ""A Night in Tunisia?"""
3,harsh unit,This is pretty handy for people who have issues shuffling but it tears the cards up so we went back to hand shuffling our canasta cards.
4,Automatic Card Shuffler,"We play ""hand and foot"" which requires one more deck than there are people playing. This necessitates a lot of shuffling. My old thumbs can't take much of that. The shuffler does a great job very fast. It seldom jams and lets us focus on the game and not the preparation. It was eay to buy, it was priced reasonably and it works great! Also I received it in a timely manner. I've had good results purchasing on Amazon.com and will continue to do so."
5,6 deck automatic card shuffler.,"I really really really like the prouct. I have played with this brand before, maybe 10 years ago. And still good quality."
4,Good Card Shuffler for Multiple Decks,"Noisy, but very good at shuffling 6 decks of cards. It would be nicer if it had a wood frame, but then it would cost more."
1,broken card shuffler,Shuffler would never work even with numerous new batteries. Sent item back and did get refund on item but not shipping. Just not meant to have this item and another that I ordered at same time. The other item also broke. First time ever for having problems with something ordered from Amazon.com
1,DOA - Broken on Arrival,Cheaply made product... No instructions on how to put it together... Plastic gears on one side were jammed and broken...
4,Happy with product,"The shuffler performed as expected. We play in a monthly card game with three other couples, this particular card game requires five decks of cards can't imaging playing without this device."
3,Hand and Foot group,"There are two vendors on Amazon for this product with slightly different pricing. A group of us have purchased half a dozen from the other vendor over a period of about 2 years - 2 failed and had to be replaced within the 30-day period, one failed a month later. Some work better than others - 2 still work very well. The picture on this one looked different and the reviews read better, so I ordered one thinking it was made by a different manufacturer. Wrong - it's the same manufacturer. So far, so good, but it's not been quite 30 days yet.We need to shuffle between 5 and 6 decks - the hints in the reviews have helped: Shuffle maybe 3 decks at a time rather than all 6 decks; tap the cards together so the edges are even; be sure the clear plastic plate is held firmly against the outside... Most of the hints are to help guide the cards so the leading edges are even and parallel.We'd still like to find a shuffler of better quality...but it sure beats shuffling 6 decks by hand!"
4,6 Deck Card Shuffler,We have had several of these. My wife uses one to play Hand & Foot twice a week. They do wear out. Her experience is expect about two years. At her rate of usage that works out to about 4 shuffles per game x twice a week x 48 weeks/yr x 2 yrs. = 768 shuffles before it is time to replace it. About 2 cents/shuffle. It is worth it!Also note above comments re more errors with older cards.
3,Six Deck Automatic Card Shuffler,"For the price, this was a great value. My only complaint is that the ""follower"" in the recepticle for the shuffled cards descends in a canted manner, thereby causing a few cards to slide off the pile and become wedged between the shuffled cards and recepticle."
2,Better than shuffling...sometimes,"If your cards are getting a little old, it won't work well at all. With new cards probably 90% effective. Sometimes cards get caught on the sides and don't get shuffled with the rest. Can't say that I would have bought this if I had tried it first."
4,Good for the price,I bought this for a friend who loves to play Hand and Foot. It seemed like card shufflers were either $15 or $200 so I took a chance on this one.So far it's held up well and shuffles the cards very quickly. We try to use newer cards and give it only 2-3 decks at a time to reduce the chance of cards flipping. I'll update this review if we encounter any problems but on the whole I'm pleased with my purchase.
2,Battery placement a problem,"While this card shuffler did work well, it was very tempermental because the batteries were not well seated and moved out of position after just a few uses. Batteries were hard to insert and had to be teased back in place frequently."
2,mediocre,"one of the little plastic clips that holds the card return bracket in place was broken upon receipt. unit still works but bracket has to be held in place. occasionally one side of shuffler is used faster than the other, leaving a portion of the opposite side un-shuffled. other than that unit does what it's supposed to."
1,Missing Parts - Did not work,"The product was missing the electrical contacts for one side of the batteries so we couldn't even get the unit to operate. I ordered the Casino 6 Deck shuffler and it worked well and had much better visual quality, too."
1,card shuffler,"The item requires 4 C batteries, which are not included. It is built of extremely flimsy plastic and when I tested it I found out that the left wheel (which has to spin to shuffle the deck on the left side) was jammed and could not be fixed. I returned the item and would not recommend it."
2,Does Not Work Well for Magic: The Gathering Cards,"Bought this shuffler to shuffle Magic: The Gathering cards, which are slightly smaller than average poker cards. The product is lightweight and felt very cheap. Very easy to use. Just put cards in each half and push the lever. It shuffled about half the deck, and then the last half just kind of flopped over on top of the shuffled cards. I don't know if this is because I wasn't using regulation-size playing cards or if it's just a crappy product, but I am returning because it's more of a hassle than shuffling by hand for my particular needs. The shuffler is not too noisy though, which is nice."
4,Much better than the older one we had,This shuffler really does shuffle 6 decks. It is slower and more efficient than the one we bought a couple of years ago. Works well.
4,Better than most,One of the better 6-deck card shufflers I have bought in a while. The springs are tight and the motor seems to be working great.
1,CARD SHUFFLER,"PURCHASED 6 DECK AUTOMATIC CARD SCHUFFLER BY BRYBELLY HOLDINGS, INC. THIS PRODUCE WORKED FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES BEFORE IT STOPPED WORKING. ONE SIDE WORKED BUT JUST A NOISE FROM THE OTHER SIDE. TERRIBLE PRODUCT."
2,Poor Quality,"The spring-loaded balance plate/tray in the center which is supposed to catch the cardsis not connected properly or the spring is too weak. When the shuffled cards fall onto the plate, the front hangs down and the cards bunch up. Therefore one has to hold the center plate while shuffling so the cards aren't a mess."
1,Only worked for 3 uses.,"Only worked for 3 uses. After the third, it stopped working. You cannot easily take this device apart. I am too late into the process to get a refund ... do not recommend purchasing."
1,Piece of junk,I ordered 2 of these shufflers and they both broke after using them 5 or 6 times. The little black insert that is supposed to keep the cards straight broke.Now the cards shuffle in all directions.A waste of money.
1,"Typical, poor quality card shuffler","Typical, poor-quality card shuffler. Easily gets off track, cards don't always lay flat, takes a lot of tweaking to get it to work each time. Storing it on its side in a box seems to throw it off for the next time it is used. Boy, if someone could make a decent, moderately-priced, multi-deck card shuffler there would be a huge market. It is so frustrating to buy these ones that are chintzy to begin with and way to expensive to buy the ""Vegas-quality"" ones that seem to be the only alternatives."
3,Fun to own,This card shuffler is great for it's intended use. We play cards with seven decks of cards about once a week and this shuffler saves us lots of time and wear and tear on the cards. Not for heavy daily use.
4,I love this sequel,"I loved this movie as a kid. Grew older and preferred the first Caddyshack and spit on this one. Now, I'm back to loving this one more.What I love about this film is the old-school humor of physical slapstick, cartoon surrealism and character-driven story. Jackie Mason is great as one of the 80's weirdest protagonists. Robert Stack tops Ted Knight's sarcastic straight man. But the characters of Randy Quaid and Dan Aykroyd steal the show.Summing the movie up: The last shot is of an animatronic gopher poppin' and lockin' to impress a poodle. Classic comedy."
1,A Compelling Argument Against Sequel Movies,"I absolutely loved the original ""Caddyshack"" from beginning to end. If I had to choose the top 10 comedy motion pictures of all time, it would definitely be on my list.....and then there's ""Caddyshack 2"".This sequel picture brings none of the characters from the original ""Caddyshack"" back except for the gopher-and even he has gotten a little full of himself. The acting is terrible all the way around. Jackie Mason is not funny (and in my opinion, never was), Robert Stack eschewed whatever dignity he had left when he agreed to take the part of a snobbish country-clubber, and one gets the impression that Dyan Cannon is only there for window dressing-or to make a few bucks. Dan Ackroyd was somewhat funny, but that doesn't redeem this worthless, bloated carcass of a movie in any respect.I'd give that fetid piece of dung of a motion picture zero stars if I could. Since I can't, the only thing I can say to prospective viewers is to avoid this one at all costs!"
2,They tried too hard!,Bad Sequel! They tried too hard! The writers overdid it with their attack on the snooty rich. Dan Arkroyd's character could have been better.
1,not that into it,I am a big dumbie. I am a movie fan. I order movies like crazy from Amazon. Even if I don't care for the movie. I still want to add it to my movie collection. I ordered the first Caddyshack even though I didn't like the movie when I saw it on tv or on my mom's VHS. Since I have the first movie I went ahead and ordered Caddyshack 2. Even though I never seen it or don't care for the first movie. I just finished watching it and my feelings didn't change about Caddyshack movies. It's not for me. But they got money out of me any ways. Because I'm a big dumbie.
4,Good Movie (Contrary to Popular Demand),"This was a really funny movie with most of the comic moments provided by ""smooth talking"" lawyer, Randy Quaid. All lawyers should be like him in this movie!"
2,"Not the worst movie of all time, as some would suggest...","but still pretty bad. As others have pointed out, Jackie Mason is the only reason to see this movie. The rest of the movie falls flat. Still worth sitting through once, just to enjoy Mason. His years of being blacklisted really deprived us.The other comment I wanted to make is that most people miss out on a great joke -- Jackie Mason's character in Caddyshack II is the same character he plays in The Jerk."
2,"NOT ""ON PAR"" WITH THE ORIGINAL! NOT EVEN CLOSE!","I remember the first time I saw this uneven and mostly unfunny sequel to the classic original. I felt violated and wanted redemption for the injustice that was bestrode upon me! I must admit that I have mellowed over the years on this movie and I feel it does have a few moments. Randy Quaid is by far the best thing in this movie and his negotiation scene about the(The Peter Blunt System)zoning laws is hysterical. Jackie Mason is no Dangerfield,but he does have a few moments. This is not essential viewing by any means, but if you have seen the original as many times as I have, you may be able to find some redeeming moments in this luke warm sequel."
1,Worst sequel ever,"I can't believe I actually paid to see this in a theater back in the day. It is not only the WORST sequel ever made, it ranks in the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen (and I saw The Box)."
1,99 minutes of my life wasted,"My mama always said, ""If you can't say anything good, say nothing.""Nothing."
2,rodney Dangerfield maid the right choice !!!!!!!!,what can you say about a movie that is so bad rodney Dangerfield would have no part of it.well chevy chase was great as ty webb but thats about it if you really need to see this movie see it for chevy chase I guess he did the film makers a favor by being in this stink bomb thats why i gave it 2 stars for ty webb..
2,Not bad but.....,"So, just see this one for Chevy Chase back as Ty Webb and that gopher. It was also co-wrote by Harold Ramis (He directed and co-wrote the first one)."
1,AN ABOMINATION,"This film deserves no rating. It is quite possibly the worst sequel of all time. It was an insult to Bill Murray to have Dan Akroyd carry on his character.This movie sucked and sucked bad. Bad acting, bad plot, and not even close to being funny. They should find every copy of this movie ever made and build a massive bonfire with them."
1,CaddyshackFan,"Why would the exploding golf ball blow up when it apparently hits the melon and when it is struck by a putter, but not when it is hit by a titanium driver? Why would a gopher want to have sex with a poodle? You'll be asking yourself questions like these and will curse losing 99 minutes you can never get back if you watch this total waste of a movie. Worst...Movie...Ever."
1,Quite possible the worst and most unfunny sequel ever made,"Avoid this movie like the plague. I can't think of one funny gag throughout the whole movie, and you can't help but feel sorry for Jackie Mason who is so much better than the script.It must have been desperate times for Chevy Chase and Dan Akyroyd to even consider appearing in this abomination of a movie.Simply a disgrace to the original."
1,A Hole in None,"What a horrible movie. Not even funny. You can tell Chevy Chase is embarrassed to even be in this suck-fest. They had to re-work the script and hire Jackie Mason at the last minute because Rodney Dangerfield backed out of the sequel...and it shows. Nice (horrible) rip-off of Bill Murray from the ever-so-lame Dan Ackroyd.PGA caddies were asked what the best movie about golf ever was...their answer, ""Caddyshack"". When asked what the worst movie about golf was...they said unanimously, ""Caddyshack 2"". Don't even think of wasting this hour-and-a-half, when you could be doing something productive. Like PLAYING golf."
5,great classical movie,"I saw this movie on tcm last month and had to get it. It is a bit like ""Gaslight"" but in my opinion better. I thought the director did a great job with the scenery and setting the tone. Like others, I thought it was expensive ( I paid 20) for a classic movie. Plus the remastered copy was nothing special and had no extras whatso ever. That was disappointing since I was looking forward to learning more about the movie. Tmc at least gives a little history of the film. But if you love good classical movies, this one is a must see."
1,Comfortable but poorly constructed/designed,"Great look, very comfortable, but big problems with the design and material used in this model. I purchased these shoes on August 23, 2007 in time to take them with me on vacation to Italy. I did a fair amount of walking through multiple cities and towns, probably more than two hours each day, always on pavement and in dry, mild weather. After the third day the metallic-style mesh on the side panels began to tear and unravel. After the fifth day the panels had multiple tears and stress lines were forming on the plastic cross-straps. After the seventh day a plastic cross-straps on one of the panels had parted, and others were cracked. The shoes were amazing in terms of comfort, ventilation (obviously), and grip. However, I am sending them back to ECCO for evaluation of the disintegration."
1,"Poor design, fell apart!","Our family LOVES ECCO shoes, but this is not a good shoe. Bought a pair for my husband who has problems with his arches and requires shoes that support his feet. ECCOs are the best fit for him. He wore them to work, which consists of him sitting in front of a computer all day, so no wear and tear on them. Within two weeks the mesh was torn and coming apart. Called Amazon, they gladly sent a new pair and we sent the old ones back. Within a few weeks, the second pair was falling apart and had to be returned for a refund. Amazon was awesome to deal with and we had no problems at all, but now we are shopping for a new pair of shoes for my husband. Too bad because he said that they were really comfortable shoes, just like you expect from ECCO. But this shoe was poorly designed."
5,Among the Author's Very Best!,"Step into Gotham City circa 1947 where you take a few steps into a local pub to get away from your wife, and by chance meet an interesting young lady, take her a few other night spots, then come home, and bang, your wife is dead! Not pleasant, especially when you can find no one in the great city to vouch for your alibi! The police arrive, and their suggestion that you may be the culprit is enough to give you the creeps. And the police detective in charge happens to be a good friend from way back, who also does not seem convinced of your innocence. So, you have 24 hours to prove yourself and the clock keeps ticking into the moment when your life may very well be through! This great thriller/ noir author spun many hard boiled tales where the lead character seems guilty, and has to prove his innocence, a nice twist on the ""innocent before proven guilty"" idea on which our system is (supposedly) based. PHANTOM LADY may be his best!"
5,Excellent Product,This is an excellent product. The book is well-written and explicit. The cards and cd and box are all beautifully designed.
1,Redundant,"This is the 2nd ""kit"" I've purchased whereby everything but the book and CD are superflous. The information placed on the flash cards could've been included in the book. I'm assuming this is a maketing trick to lower cognitive dissonance when purchasing shlock like this. The oil...no where does the kit tell you what's in the bottle. And forget about the ""dream diary""...wasted pages with not enough room for notes, and the same ""inspirations"" on every page of the journal.It is insulting to produce material that is clearly...CLEARLY...designed to create barriers for consumers to return goods. You see, once you remove the packaging...there's an open CD...oil...you're stuck with the kit regardless of the contents. You've been warned."
5,Book with shape sorter included...what a GREAT idea!,"For any child who loves books and shape sorting, this book is the BEST! My 2-year-old son's speech therapist brings it to his sessions, and my son loves it! What a great idea to combine two of the best kid activities - reading & shape sorting! Very creative! Cute, Cute, Cute!"
5,A Toddlers Dream Toy,"My son got this last Christmas when he was one and hasn't quite playing with it. I know I will get him the Christmas one this year. He literally plays with it again and again and again. It is very sturdy and has so far stood up to him. The only challenge is keeping up with all the pieces, but it's his favorite so I make the effort. BUY THIS!"
5,Very original...,"This book was great because it was very original and just...cute... There are a lot of books based on journals, but to have credit card statements tell a story makes it all the more interesting."
3,Cute,"This was a cute book. I enjoyed the stories and the writing style was fun.I am glad that I don't have her credit card debts! and it is amazing how much of your life you can reconstruct based on old credit card receipts.Some of the stories were a tad boring, but overall the book was funny and I would consider purchasing other books by this author."
4,Interesting but dulls near the end,"I thought this book had a very interesting, fresh concept. The author kept my attention in the beginning. However, near the end, she seems to be trying too hard."
4,A book for all disciplines,"This amazing little handbook is the perfect quick reference for nurses, physicians, and drug abuse counselors. Thank you, Dr. Gitlow."
4,Aircraft Carriers,"I enjoyed the History Channel's subject on the origins of the aircraft carriers up to the present day. It was an eye opener also that some of the innovations of the modern US aircraft carriers were designed by the British. However, I noticed that the jeep carriers of World War 2 were not included and that although the Forrestal class was discussed at lenght, the Kitty Hawk and JFK class of aircraft carriers were not part of subject. The Enterprise is a class of its own and the Nimitz class ships were very detailed. I would have preferred though that the latest and most modern and recently commissioned Ronald Reagan included in the film. The LHAs and LHDs were also not brought out when one can see that they resemble the carriers, they still are by and large aircraft carriers. Otherwise, the documentary was very good and I look forward to other films about modern ships not only of the US but also with the former Soviet Union."
4,Alistair's Yoga Sutras,"This little gem is a great beginning for a newcomer to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. It is easy to read, and organized in a nice way. It can aide the study of the sutras when studied along with other more detailed Sutra translations (such as BKS Iyengar's Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.) My husband, a non-yogi, picked this book up from the bed, whereas he never picked up Iyengar's version. It is easy to read, accessible to a novice, and a more poetic and simple to understand translation. For those diehards who are studying every translation on the sutras possible, I suggest Prof. Edwin Bryants'new translation on the Sutras."
2,Pretty but I would pass on this,"My husband and I thought this bassinet would be perfect for our new baby--not too frilly and with a classic look. We were very disappointed. The only thing that is machine washable is the pad cover. Everything else must be hand washed! Also, it doesn't rock automatically, a feature that was somewhat implied. So I can rock it myself right? BARELY! It has very little motion and when it reaches its furthest point it makes a knocking noise that is sure to wake napping babies. While it is still a good-looking bassinet, it is must less functional than they would have you believe. Pass on this until they can improve on it."
5,A Very Big Book on Goethe,"This book is undoubtedly the best book on Goethe available in English. Boyle's descriptions of Weimar and Jena bring the late 18th and early 19th century to life. After reading the book, I had a much better grasp on Goethe and his contemporaries. I recommend the book highly to anyone seriously interested in understanding German literature. My one complaint is that the book is almost too unwieldly to read in bed. It also took several months to digest. (But well worth the effort!)"
3,Great film. Poor DVD.,"Like all of the Fox/Lorber releases of Eric Rohmer's ""Six Moral Tales"" film series, I'd give this film 5 stars for content, especially if you enjoy writer/director Eric Rohmer's subtle, deliberatly paced, conversational style. His films crawl into your consciousness slowly and before you know it you're hooked. Unfortunatly I'd give the DVD transfer 1 star as it looks and sounds no better than Fox/Lorber's currently available VHS version and there are no extras to speak of except for incomplete director and star filmography listings. The film is not presented in its original aspect ratio and the French subtitles are burned into the print and so are not removable from the screen. Final rating: 3 stars END"
4,"Really, really interesting","Eric Rohmer's series of Six Moral Tales is best represented by Chloe in the Afternoon, IMO. Filmed in 1972, the movie is dated now, populated by women in ultra-miniskirts, guys in tight suits with flared jackets, weird hair...you get the picture. But the focus is timeless: sophisticated bourgeois married couple with children nearly ripped asunder by threatened infidelity. Chloe is the bohemian outsider, a seductress with an agenda, and Frederic is her intended victim. The ending is sort of a shocker, a little over the top, but otherwise, wow, it's a corker."
3,A bit tedious,"Yes, this 1972 classic does deal with big issues between men and women, but must it be so boring? The characters spend the film seemingly going in and out of office and apartment and coffee shop doors. That passes for the action. The rest is dialogue. Paris looks dismal, and the suburbs especially so. The two women, the wife and the would-be mistress, are still attractive by today's standards. One wonders what the plotting Chloe really sees in the dull hubby after all. There is no soundtrack. There is little at all to distract from the script. Very French, I suppose."
2,Chloe in the Afternoon,"The lackluster direction of Rohmer doesn't match the intensity of the themes involved. It's like he's trying to imply a movie instead of making one. Everything looks frayed, but it goes deeper than mere understatement: nobody in the movie has a spine and it's as if they're being held upward by strings. The movie has such a soft mushy feel to it that the erotic scenes don't feel erotic. It's like he's trying to take away all the fun, but wants to tease us at the same time. And that's okay in itself -- Bergman's Persona is the ultimate tease -- but here you're not sure who is in control, and the experience just becomes tedious."
3,"Good for beginners, but really out of date...","I found that the one chapter on the Direct3D Imediate mode ok, but slim. The rest of the book was very simplistic. Most of the samples are very basic and never cover more advanced topics in full. Not recommended for serious developers looking for a Direct3D Imediate mode book. This is for the beginner, looking for a quick way into 3d graphics and not interested in many of the details of DirectX. Regardless of quality, it still only lightly covers DirectX 2, 4 versions out of date. Wait till the next pressing..."
3,Look at the title folks...,"The book's title accurately describes its contents. It teaches ""3D Graphics Programming"" (not Direct3D) using ""C++ Programming Techniques with Direct3D.""Portions of the Direct3D Retained Mode API are encapsulated in MFC-savvy C++ classes (e.g. C3dDevice, C3dViewport, etc.). These classes are used exclusively in the examples to teach the ""basics of 3D graphics programming."" (Also, there are weird pictures of Nigel in an odd duck shirt.)If you are a professional SWE/Programmer looking for a book on Direct3D, keep looking... THIS IS NOT IT. (But like I said, if you'd read the title, you would realize this...)"
1,Waste of money,I foolishly bought this expensive doorstop thinking I might learn something about Direct3D. Unfortunately all it really tells you about is how to use the author's own wrapper library. (Which doesn't compile with the Direct X 5 SDK... you have to use Direct X 2 on the CD. Obsolete or what?)
2,Not his best,"Vidal has written some of the most engaging and impressive works of historical fiction ever put to paper, but this one is not one of them. The characters are flat, and the Europeanized American protagonist makes it difficult to finish the book. Indeed, Vidal's leftist commentary on American history gets tiresome here. For better Vidal, try ""Julian""."
2,reads like a newspaper article,"I approached this book hoping that Vidal's writing would make it a worthwhile read; nothing bores me more completely than politics. Unfortunately his writing rarely rises above the level of mere journalism and a passionless chronicling of powerplays undertaken by tedious old men. It was impossible to really care about the narrator and his hopes for his daughter for he was as shallow as anyone in the book (which is to say appalingly shallow) if only slightly more intelligent. Although the initial descriptions of New York City being remade were fascinating, the rest was simply tiresome to read and completely lacked vigour and narrative drive."
2,Blue Blood Conversation,"If you move in high circles and/or want to sharpen your conversation repertoir, this book is for you. If you want to learn how the rich and influential lived in New York in the 1870s this book is for you. Otherwise you will find this book boring."
3,For US history buffs only,"I started in on this book after finishing ""Burr"" and reading the reviews on this site (choosing to skip ""Lincoln"", for the time being.)After enjoying ""Burr"" so much, I had high expectations for this, expecting the same humor, insight on US notables of the time and their era and solid character development.My review however is not so enthusiastic. Granted, I knew next to nothing about the election of 1876 and the characters who played the major roles in the election, and now I know a great deal. But if it is sheer enlighenment on an important,but not vital to know, part of US history, consult the history or encyclopedia.I found the characters to be fairly one dimensional and, in the end, not that interesting (unlike the characters in Burr.)Plus, Gore's sly humor, so evident in ""Burr"", seems scarce in this book."
4,Anything New Out There? Look Here,"R U WONDERING about (i) the future of music, (ii) whether rave/trance has anywhere else to go, and (iii) just where the latest digital music-making technology has gone? Well, here, we have - from Luaka Bop Records (David Byrne's label) - a compilation of musics (from the recently liberated eastern bloc) which may have some answers. Trance has never sounded so... freaking trance-like. Don't be fooled by the post-hip suspiciously David-Byrne-sounding oh so detached description on the back of the CD. This compilation is NOT machine-like. It truly reflects the human emotions behind the various projects - playful, hypnotic and, at times, truly sublime (if somewhat repetitious ONLY if you are not REALLY listening). The future of music may be found here. As musical wallpaper, or as an intense listening experience, these layered, poly-rhymthic, musical adventures will amuse, mystify, and entrance your mind. Welcome to the New World!"
3,Could have been better,"All of the artists on this CD are talented, but the tracks seem to have been selected to minimize their differences, which results in a surprisingly bland offering. If you're interested in this whole blip-hop, glitch, IDM-thing, there are much better places to start (such as the ""Clicks + Cuts"" series, ""Electric Ladyland Clickhop V.1.0,"" or even Warp's ""Compilation"").The essay (by David Bryne) included in the liner notes is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek anthropological analysis of the influence of cold climates on people and their technology, but it comes across as sloppy and trite. It is doubtless intended to be a not-so-serious analysis of what Bryne thinks is a not-so-serious genre, but his writing is littered with repetitions of the same stock phrases and lacks focus, while the artists on the CD are very focused and precise (however playful their sounds)."
2,Fails to showcase a fascinating genre,"David Byrne's good taste and perceptive commentary introduced me to Brazilian popular music, and for this I am grateful. But his take on 'blip hop' -- these days, most people are calling it 'click-hop' or 'glitch' -- is surprisingly weak. There isn't a single track here you can't do without. It fails to show you why you should care about this really amazing sub-genre of electronic pop music. For a much better introduction to the genre, buy anything by Andreas Tilliander, who also records under the name Mokira."
5,Best baseball book I've ever read!,I was given this book as a Christmas gift from a friend. Talk about a great gift! Daryl Brock masterfully spins this tale of fiction mixed with fact that makes it difficult to put down. My favorite part was the invention of the bunt. My only problem is I lent it out and haven't gotten it back and now I can't find it. I want to pass it along to my father(after I read it again of course)who I know will enjoy it. Any suggestions?
5,Great Time Travel Book for Baseball Lovers,"Is this science fiction? It is science fiction in that If I Never Get Back is a time travel book like you have never read before. This book takes Sam Fowler from modern San Francisco back to the early days of baseball (post-Civil War) and the newly formed Cincinnati Red Stockings. What makes this book so interesting is the description of how baseball was played in 1869 - so different than what it is today even as to the way pitchers pitched.Sam Fowler begins riding the rails with the fledgling Cincinnati Red Stockings and their trip around the U.S. to play other early baseball teams. It also goes into the atmosphere of the time, as in the description when the team played in New York City in a park that now is no more in these modern times.Ah, but then it is also a love story. But is it unrequited love? Is it a lost love? And does Sam ever find her again?Great baseball book and would make a great movie also."
5,"A very gripping book, makes you feel you're actually there.","I read this book when it first came out and itgrabbed me,making me interested in a sport that I had never really had any interest in before. The author makes you feel that you are right there, playing along with the characters."
2,Only if you appreciate fantasy,"The device used in this book to recount the saga of the Cincinnati Red Stockings is a good one, I suppose, if you gobble up fantasy. But the idea of present day person living in 1869 and knowing all that has happened since is a difficult one. Conrad Richter uses a similar device in The Waters of Kronos and I liked that book. But the author here did not succeed in making me believe in the scenario, and this got in the way of enjoying the book. But I suppose the scores and the like are authentic? The author could have at least given us a bibliography, if there is one. Thus those who wanted to know about the winning streak could check on it."
4,"Great book, cheated on the ending","I just got done reading this again and like most here, I think this book really captures the time period with an engaging story. However, the reason for only 4 stars is that the book jacket lied about the ending. It said something like a 'climactic ending' with 'answers to why Sam went back'. I disagree, the ending was anti-climactic with Sam only guessing as to why he went back (didn't know if he was Colm or not). Therefore, the reader is left not knowing why as well."
5,I man goes unconsciousness and finds himself in 1869.,"The book, If I Never Get Back, is an extremely excellent book that will leave you at the edge of your seat the whole time you're reading it. It is a mind-blowing novel about a man from modern day San-Francisco with a horrible life. One day at the train station, he falls into deep unconsciousness and finds himself in 1869. He meets up with America's first all-pro baseball team, The Cincinnati Redstockings. He meets up with some pretty odd characters and even meets his hero, Mark Twain. I highly recommend this book about a man and his travel through time."
5,Must Have,"Everyone who believes in God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit should have this excellent book in their homes. It is beautifully written and illustrated. It is able to put into words some of the things we feel but can't begin to express!!!! It was recommended to me by a neighbor and I would recommend it to everyone."
2,Returned it,Bought revitol and returned it since i didnt like it. I am buying another product instead....maybe dermafreeze or rejuvinol
5,buy this album now!,"I bought this album after hearing only their split 7 inch w/ the stiffs and The Curse Of The Hearse cd compilation. The quality of ""Creepy Crawly"" was 1000 times better!It has a definite Misfits-like,horror genre feel to it, but Corey Gorey mixes an element of personal experiences into the spooky imagery in a way that the misfits never did. It is really catchy in a tragic, heartbreaking way that anyone who wishes it was Holloween everyday can relate to.The songs are much more up-beat and melodic than you would expect if you've only heard ""funeral drive"" or ""Satan Takes a Holliday"". It's not your classic ""goth"" dribble.It's an album you NEED in your record collection if you like good music that happens to be made by witty dead boys. It's fun. It refuses to be classified. Buy it. You won't regret it."
1,Useless except to beginner VC++ 6.0 students,"The authors of this book clearly have no experience in modern C++. Even considering the book was written in 1999, it is woefully outdated. No C++ strings, no C++ standard headers, no STL. Further, the book clearly targets Visual C++ 6.0 users. It has little value if you use a modern C++ compiler, whether that compiler is a more recent edition of Visual C++, or whether it is gcc, Borland C++, or any of the other options.Even ignoring those problems, the book claims to be for intermediate or advanced programmers. This is a stretch. Beginners may find some information they did not already know, but the concepts are entirely too simplistic for advanced developers. There are far, far better C++ books out there. Stay away from this one."
4,Dickies knit shirt,"size good, fit good, confort good, ease of care good, overall satisfaction goodintend to purchase two more for general wear"
5,Book Review,My son likes the Hardy Boy books. They are priced low and they are in good condition. I really like ordering from Amazon. I always find Amazon prices to be much better than the stores. The books come promptly after I order them too. Thanks Amazon. I will continue ordering from you.
4,Story is Good (4 stars) - Kindle Version is Bad,"My oldest son read this book when he was 8 and enjoyed it (didn't love it). I just bought the Kindle version for my youngest, who is also 8, and he's enjoying the story, but keeps pointing out all the typos in the book. For $6.99 I think they could have done a better job!"
4,Great Classic Nature Documentary,"For anyone who loves the outdoors, this is a bit of nostalgia. This takes you back to a look at the state of the wilderness in the early 1970s, when folks first began to take notice of the harm that man has done to nature. I am not a tree hugger, but someone who has kids of my own, and realizes that driving two hours to work and that there are few places left to hunt or fish pretty much sums up the sad state of our environment these days. This documentary is in the fine tradition of classic outdoors features such as Virgil Ward and the American Outdoorsman. Sit down with your kids and watch this! Then ask your local authorities why that new subdivision HAS to be built..."
3,disappointing,"I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED THE ""LET'S GO"" CD. THIS ONE IS DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE SUSIE DOES NOT SING ENOUGH. I REALLY LOVE HER VOICE AND DON'T ENJOY THE CHILDREN'S VOICES."
3,Not classic renditions of these songs,"I was searching for a CD that had traditional renditions of these classic songs. Some of the songs on this CD sound traditional, but many are very strange. One song sounds like a ""rap"" version, others sung in a ""classical/operatic"" manner. I think it is harder for a child to recognize the music and sing along with these strange arrangements. I would not recommend this CD if you are looking for traditional sounding songs."
3,Read this to gain a balanced perspective on your musically gifted kid.,"This mom struggles with what to do with her musically gifted kids. She becomes pretty consumed with developing their skills. This book encouraged me to take a more active role in working with my own musically gifted child. However, it also vividly illustrates the dangers of becoming a ""music"" mom. Overall, I didn't enjoy the book but think it gave me new direction and perspective to my own situation."
3,handy guide for nursing students,"Only 3 stars because the information seems to be a little outdated and there is a lot of information that seems to be geared more toward PA or MD students. For example, the book goes into detail about inserting a picc line, when, for nursing purposes all we need to know is what to look for before we give meds (placement confirmation) and dressing changes."
5,Wonderful work,"Mr Schonberg demonstrated expert musical criticism and personal devotion to his difficult subject. Biographical information is plentiful and accurate, including insight into Horowitz' everyday life and manners. Musical comments on recordings are somewhate more controversial, with a bitterness in respect to Horowitz' last recordings that I find hard to understand. Anyway, an indispensable book."
4,You don't have to watch their show to enjoy their music!,"The Canadian group ""Barrage"" describe their violin/fiddle project as exploring musical styles tracing the roots of the violin in different cultures and bring forth the ethnic components in a contemporary theatrical way. Their goal to create something unique, something that you haven't heard before has been successfully achieved with their self-titled album. It's an interesting blend of energetic fiddle playing, foot stomping percussion, dynamic guitar work and vibrant vocals. While listening to this album you eventually think (at least subconsciously) of Celtic songs,Michael Flatley(Lord of the Dance),Stephane Grappelli and John McLaughlin. (Well I did!)Their music is a combination of traditional and modern sounds that will appeal to many people with very different tastes in music.(Although being a Rap/Hip-Hop fan myself, I enjoyed ""Barrage"" a lot) :)"
5,"Amazing, Wonderful, Inspiring","I have been a fan for 2 years, and I recently saw them live. As a violinist, I have never been more inspired by any one group than Barrage. They show that you don't need to be a star, and that everyone has talent that needs to be showcased. They work together with such teamwork while feeding the audience and springing off of their energy as well. I would highly recommend this CD to everyone-you don't have to be a lover of the strings to be awestruck with their talent. They combine all sorts of music including Irish, Ukrainian, and much much more. [URL] to check them out. [URL}"
5,Fiddle sensation!,"Being a violin player myself, I am always on the lookout for good violin music. I am open to all styles of music, from classical and jazz to rap and heavy metal. One day, I picked up the remote and started channel surfing. I stopped when I saw this group of musicians performing really catchy music. I fell instantly in love with them. As soon as I could, I bought the CD and DVD, and did everything I possibly could to see them live! I bought the Barrage sheet music, and was first in line to get autographs. I was so psyched to meet them. Most people heard the word 'violin' and they think, ew classical music ..., but this is quality music. It's a fusion of everything you could possibly do on the violin. I highly recommend Barrage to anyone who is a fan of music!"
5,Barrage at Epcot,"I recently had the good fortune to ""happen"" upon this group at Epcot .... purely by accident, and it was the best experience of the day. They were entrancing. I wanted more when it was time for them to end their performance. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a perfomance, and the performers like I enjoyed this group. You could see that this group of young people were enjoying themselves. Their CD is just like their performace, alive and toe tapping. I look forward to hearing more from them. Anyone who enjoys ""fiddling"" will not be dissapointed."
4,Evil Aussies!,"I saw this not long before visiting Down Under and going to Uluru (Ayers Rock). I was amazed to read that, in spite of this film, in spite of the fact Lindy Chamberlain's conviction was overturned, a THIRD inquest was held into the death of poor little Azaria in 1995, and you know what? THEY STILL DON'T BELIEVE LINDY! The coroner would not hand down a verdict stating that a dingo killed Azaria. And I read a statistic that 1 out of every 3 Australians still think - that is, still firmly believe - that Lindy Chamberlain murderered her.This is a heartbreaking film, especially given that it's a true story. Streep and Neil are superb."
5,a cry in the dark,my girlfriend saw the actual people depicted in this movie on television and wanted to see what everyone was talking about ... she said she enjoyed it very much.
4,Sooo It really was a DIngo.....,Not a review for the movie but I heard of the movie. This should have never took so long to solve this case. When your in the outback what does people expect to happen with poachers and dingos running around oh and crocodiles' as well. Instead they charge a mother with murdering her baby??!! Five stars for the mother but 0 stars for the police. And 30 years later the mother was found to have been telling the truth confirmed by the coroner...Wow what else could I say but... DUH!!!! A Dingo is a wild animal did they (cops) think it would carry the baby off and raise it?? sighs
1,Can't review movie A Cry in the Dark,"I cannot review this movie because I was not able to watch it, but you at Amazon should be aware that I was sent the wrong code for this country. Had to return it, and your customer service department did that for me nicely. I still haven't seen the movie and I really wanted to watch it."
2,how much is that doggie in the outback? the one with the waggly tail?,"this is probably the funniest movie i have ever seen. meryl streep is a laff riot as a kooky aussie gal who rises to fame as a star of her own sitcom with the catchphrase: ""a dingo took my baby!"" i havent laughed this hard since the first time i saw a marx brothers movie, and ... oh wait. im sorry. someone looking over my shoulder read this and just advised me that this is NOT a comedy. sorry, dont pay attention to anything ive just said. mine bad!"
5,Amazing cd!,"Note: This review is for the first disc, as I have not yet listened to the second disc.Let me start of by saying that this is one of my favorite cds. I have been listening to it non-stop since I got it, which was a week ago today. The opening version of Passion was in Japanese (unlike in the game), but is was good all the same. My favorite songs are:1. Dearly Beloved3. Passion-opening version-4. Lazy Afternoons8. Fragments of Sorrow10. Kairi12. The 13th Struggle13. Roxas24. Organization XIII36. Fields of Honor38. Vim and Vigor39. Cloudchasers50. Winnie the PoohThe overall best song was Organization XIII."
4,Almost Perfect!!!!,The CD has everything. From the tracks from every part of the game to the Songs Passion and Passion(after the battle). The only thing that I would say disappointed me was that it didn't have the english tracks Passion and Atlantica Songs. Far from that its an awesome buy.
5,Thank You,This was one thng my son really wanted. Thank you for having it in stock and getting me out of the hot seat!
2,just not enough,"Okay, this is a nice little dictionary if you want to be a tourist in Wales. It has handy pronounciation guideds and easy quick find phrases. The problem is most people in Wales speak English and so this book is really no use to a serious learner of Welsh. Its vocabulary is limited, the selection poor, and it does not explain enough of the grammer. It would be much better to spend more and get a really good, complete dictionary."
3,ending the 60hz ground loop hum?,"DID not get rid of the ground loop problem , thought it would with the faraday cage and isolated transformer. dont know what else to do as this is usually the way to go. my tubes are still buzzing like crazy and the sound went down by only a fraction.Not worth it for me but maybe to someone else its going back"
4,great backgrounder,"If you're one of the few actually going to Antarctica, this book will give you an excellent background on the White Continent. It's not necessarily the best for planning a trip -- you'll get more up-to-date cruise ship info. online. But Lonely Planet will tell you all about the different possible landing spots, which can help you choose which tour to take. There's also good details about the most common embarkation points for Antarctica cruises. This book was handy when my husband & I planned our trip to the peninsula, which we chronicle in our DVD ""T&T's Real Travels in Antarctica"" (also available on amazon.com)."
4,Textbook Delivery,The book was delivered in a timely manner. Packaging was good as well as condition of parcel.
2,I pretty much hate this book,"This book has a terrible layout. Some of the clothes are nice, but they are shown on wire forms which make them look awful. Not an eye pleaser at all, but it serves as an ok reference."
2,Not impressed,"I make bed frames, production-style, for a living. I drill lots of 1 inch diameter holes to countersink the bolt heads that hold the rails on so I figured that it would make sense to get a carbide Forstner bit since it would last practically forever compared to the regular steel bit I use.I used this bit once and then put it away because it left a terrible, jagged edge on the hole and seemed to tear, rather than cut the wood fibers. I'm giving it two stars because the wood I use is fir which is quite prone to having long fibers tear all over the place so it's likely that this bit works great with hardwoods and the like, but really, my regular steel Forstner bit cuts a MUCH cleaner hole than this fancy-pants carbide door stop. Your mileage may vary."
3,Needs YKK,The jacket is nicely styled and generally well constructed. My only complaint is the zipper. It is lightweight and cheap feeling and mine sticks at the bottom when opening and closing. A few extra cents for a better zipper and my rating would have an extra star or two.Overall a very good deal for ten bucks.
3,Hamburger just like fast food,"My grandson likes this hamburger which seems just like the fast food ones. However, Grandma was not too thrilled with all the pieces of french fries which are all over the house.Otherwise, it is fun for my grandson when he is playing in his kitchen."
2,"DO NOT EAT, WARNING, DO NOT EAT","THIS IS NOT A REAL FOOD. My son tried to eat these the other day because they are so realistic looking and he almost choked. Thank god he has a tiny mouth (it's rated in the 4 percentile for his age) and couldn't fit it into his mouth, but he tried to eat it!!!!If you want realistic looking food to fool your friends with on April Fools, buy this, because they will totally try to eat it (I was tricked twice myself this past April Fools) but if you want your kids to be safe, do not buy this because they might choke and die."
1,Watch OUt,"This is a three volume set, and its excellent. Unfortunatley, when you order all they send you is Volume 1, and they never mention its a three volume set or that you are only getting volume 1. Amazon acts like its one book not three."
5,One Size Fits All,"My review title may seem a bit odd, but it has significance to this work. The Used 911 Story is indeed a book for all Porsche enthusiasts--not just for those looking to buy their first used 911. Although having owned Porsches--mostly 911s--since the late sixties, I found lots of things in Peter's book I never knew about. He is very, very knowledgeable with regard to these cars and he has a unique and very readable style by which he shares this information with his readers. In short this is a great book if you're buying your first used Porsche, if you already own a Porsche, or if you're just interested in the marque. I recommend it most highly."
4,"GREAT book, but some of the older models need updates","This book has a TON of GREAT info from an EXTREMELY knowledgeable author. He doesn't hold back and identifies all the weaknesses in addition to all the positives regarding evry model 911 up through 2005. It's even got a section on the 914 and Boxter. My only complaint about the book (and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars) is that it's obvious that he didn't ""touch"" some of the chapters on the older models (this is the 8th Edition). References to prices and styles compared to ""modern"" cars were obviously written in the 80's and he just left the chapters as is. Other than that, it's a GREAT book. If you're considering buying a Porsche 911 (and please, start pronouncing it correctly.....""porsh-uh""), you HAVE to buy this book."
5,The first Porsche 911 book to buy,"If you are thinking of buying a Porsche 911, or already own one, Peter Zimmermann's ""the Used 911 Story"" is just as valuable as the owner's manual. Read this book before negotiating a purchase and it will save you untold hours, days, years of frustration with a lemon. If you already own a 911, be prepared to find out more about your car than you know now--guaranteed. Just get it--you won't be sorry."
4,good practical information,. Good practical infomation. Well organized by year. Wish it was bigger with even more info. Probably not that useful for the advanced Porsche owner.
5,Don't buy a 911 without it,"This is a great book, both for people who know 911s and those who don't. It gives a clear year by year description of pros and cons."
2,Marginal Info,"This book has next to no valuable info on late model 911's. If you're in the market for a 997, 996 or 993 I would look elsewhere. Overall, I would not recommend this book as there really doesn't seem to be any useful advice most buyers of this car already wouldn't know. Not sure why it received so many ""must have"" reviews as the book itself isn't very impressive, photos are black and white and the amount content is equivalent to a magazine."
5,Mulligan At His Best.,Mulligan had an excellent back up band for this live set and the music just rides along on the energy of these muso's all enjoying themselves. Highly recommended.
3,Love the color,"the one size fits all runs on the big size for sure. I purchased this for my 15 year old son, he has to fold the hat to fit his head."
3,Concrete Cowboys,"A review and a request! I was an extra in a ""Concrete Cowboys"" episode filmed in New Orleans. Our own Rhonda Sheer had a small role. I would like a copy of this episode as I keep buying the pilot over and over because of re-packaging. It is a cute, fun show. Entertaining. Jerry Reed and Tom Selleck are two guys getting into trouble and catching the bad guys. Smokey & the Bandit days, sure, but those were fun! I would REALLY like to have a copy of the one I was in. Anybody?"
3,Concrete Cowboys,Kinda of cheesey 70's style movie. But I wanted to complete the cowboy part of a Tom Selleck collection. Funny but cheesey!
1,Don't bother with this one!!!!!,This is a really stupid movie--acting is fair at best and the plot is very routine. I love Tom Selleck but it is better not to waste your time on this one.
1,Not really worth it........,Very campy but a treat seeing Jerry Reed and Tom Selleck together. Crazy stuff. Not worth paying full price though.
1,Unwatchable bootleg,"Packaging was homemade. Unwatchable bootleg copy. Tried watching on three different DVD players and a laptop computer, but would not work. Now I am worried about buying any DVDs online."
2,Pre-Magnum Sellick; best forgotten,"This 1979 made for TV film preceded Sellick's great and deserved success in the long-running TV series Magnum, PI. It recounts the adventures of two ex-cowboys who have left their ranch to see the world.If you are a fan, you might well enjoy this routine plot as they are mistaken for detectives and agree to search for a missing girl in Nashville. There is as much country music flavor to the film as can be fit in between episodes of their misadventures which may please lovers of country films.All in all, not a positively painful film to watch for someone trying to fill part of an evening, perhaps more enjoyable for someone with a particular interest in the star or the setting."
2,"Poor script, direction, and acting",Some well liked actors not doing well. Poor direction and script.
5,Great Movie for a $1,I bought this movie for a dollar at walmart and I just simply loved it. I can't believe all the bad reviews it's getting. I totally disagree. I love Tom Sellek in this film. To me this film was total gem all the way to the end.
1,Concrete Cowboys VHS,"Bad Acting, Bad movie, Cool Car and some scenes, too bad, I should have known!!!!!!"
2,Lots of big stars but ....,"This movie has lots of big stars, but I barely managed to stay awake to finish it. Tom Selleck makes a great cowboy, and Morgan Fairchild was good. But the movie was boring - I had the plot figured out halfway through and I'm normally not good at guessing - it was that obvious. Sure glad I purchased a used copy so I got it for cheap. I'll give it to Goodwill ... you couldn't make me watch this movie twice."
3,Very little combat,"What i liked about ""Guadalcanal Diary"" is that he was present at the big battle's like Hell's Point and the battle of Edson's ridge. He arrived in sicily after the landings and he saw little combat before being wounded."
4,Satisfied,"WYSIWYG - item received is what was described and pictured on-line. Shipping was timely. No surprises or complaints, very satisfied."
4,"Master of mood, location and dialogue","Towards the end of the book there is brilliantly crafted dialogue between the two sisters, back and forth: make a point, loose a point on the counter attack. All in front of their dying father leaving one to wonder at the inherent selfcentered cruelness of these siblings who have taken so much. Not only that, interplay between the other characters is also well drawn as is the description of the boarding house guests and in particular one who ...but that will give too much away.Open the book at any page to browse and it will not be put down but turned to the front to begin the tale.Poor translations can at best be pedestrian and loose the sparkle of the orignial. The edition I read did not suffer from that defect but planted me squarely in Paris, its social machinations and mores, and the fasinating very human characters, flaws and all."
2,"Please, don't feel compelled to read the classics","While Balzac is clearly a genius and Reed does an incredible job translating, this book is not a good story, but just a platform to get the author's views on society and human nature across. There are exhaustingly long descriptions of places and characters, and endless monologues. In the end we don't find out what happens to one of the key characters, and it just seemed like a grand waste of time to me. Also, some of the prose is written in an unnecessarily flowery way making it a slow read where you are not even sure what he is talking about. I would have preferred to spend my time bouncing a ball off a wall."
4,Worth owning!,"I read all the worst reviews about this CD before buying it and I must disagree with them. I have been in Godspell and am currently directing it and this CD is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a recording that wasn't 20-30 years old but still kept the show accessible to the masses and this version is it. I also own the 2001 Touring as well as the original Broadway and Movie Soundtrack. This recording is actually quite good. The things that I like best is the band and the arrangements of the songs. They are fresh and new but still use an orchestration that can be reproduced by a community theatre. The 2001 was so far out there and ""techno"" that it is next to impossible to duplicate that in a smaller theatre without major sequencing. This CD feels new and updated without destroying the music that Schwartz wrote. I like it a lot. It is perfect for a director trying to get a feel for the music and wanting someonething new at the same time."
1,Anemic.,"Alright, the singers hit every note perfectly, and it's ALMOST a complete recording, but this is one of the least moving recordings of Godspell I've ever heard. ""Tower Of Babel,"" the opening number, is particularly lifeless, especially compared to the version from the 2001 National Touring Cast CD. Get that one instead of this and you'll be a lot more satisfied."
1,GODSPELL... a (...) amateurish production cd.,"This is the worst recording of GODSPELL it has ever been my misfortune to own. I listened to it once, and promptly threw it away. I LOVE this show, and the new touring 2001 updated show... but this one. Did people get paid for this? It's so amateurish, it's .... Music Direction is non-existant, accompaniment is sparse and awkward--- and the unabashed lack of vocal talent makes this a PLEASE DO NOT BUY cd. Really, this is awful."
4,very cool musical updated for 2000!,"this is a great version of this show. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that traditionalists who are enamored with the original ""sound"" of the show may not like it. The voices in this cast are truly amazing. This is not a basic piano accompaniment, but a true rock band. Some of the songs are done in really unique styles as well such as calypso, reggae, gospel...There is much more dialogue then in other recordings of the show as well. Definately worth getting if you're a fan!"
5,haven't listened to the whole album....,"I have listened to sound clips online, and I was telling my bro: ""You have to listen to this! Aren't they great? etc, etc!"" Shoshana is great at ""Bless The Lord"", Capathia sings a killer ""Turn Back O Man"" and Catherine sings probably the best version of ""Day By Day"" I have ever heard. (The rest were good, too, but I cant really remember them all.) Believe it or not, I'm working with Catherine at the Bass Hall in GODSPELL, ironically (im a kid's choir role, im way too young to be pro), but in this she plays Peggy. She's great anyway, though!So, that's all I have to say."
5,Amazing Recording - Nothing Missing,"I saw this revival of this musical and was amazed. I had to go see it, like, 10 times. I just got the recording of it and am just amazed that this cast was able to still convey the energy (which is at a very high-level) that they gave on stage to this incredibly modern version of a fun show like Godspell. Leslie Kritzer's ""Learn Your Lessons Well"" and Shoshana Bean's ""Bless The Lord"", are definitely the highlights. Also, this is one of the first times that the Prologue (Tower of Babble) has been recorded. Buy this album if you are a Godspell fan or if you don't like the music from the original because it is updated and completely NEW. Buy it now."
2,Not a particularly good RTS game,The controls are difficult to use and the game play is not up to the current standard for this genre.
2,Poorly Concealed Sales Vehicle,"I respect William J. O'Neil and his expertise. ""24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success"", however, is a poorly concealed sales vehicle for his ""Investor's Business Daily"" and his previous books. I'm disappointed and would not recommend this book - especially since much of the information Mr. O'Neil emphasizes as his alone through his own publications is available through so many other sources, most of them free and online. Buy his other books, by all means, but not this one."
2,Great Advertisement - poor book,"This book covers a lot of the fundamental basics that other books contain, but the recurring theme throughout is, ""If you really want to learn how the market works you should subscribe to my newsletter"".I don't know if the Investor's Business Daily is any good, but certainly the credibility of the author is damaged in my eyes... IBD should have paid me to read this extended advertisement, rather than the other way around."
2,Ad for O'Neil's IBD,"Bill O'Neil is certainly an experienced Wall Street trader, but he, talking bussiness, ""tends"" to use his books as an advertisement campaign for Investor's Business Daily, a newspaper he created and own. To have an idea the book offers 2 weeks free of Investor's Bussiness Daily, wich you also can get on it's website at [URL].The book has certainly good tips and some others not that good. For example, he suggests that a broker is only good if it subscribes to the Investor's Business Daily. He could be a little more discreet! Some of the 24 lessons are only helpfull if you subscribe to the Investor's Business Daily, so unless you subscribe or plan to, this book is not worth the money."
1,It is not needed,"I loved O'Neil's first book ""How to Make Money In Stocks"" and is required reading for anyone who puts money in the stock market through individual stocks or mutual funds. So, I wanted to be able to pick his mind as much as possible. However there is no new information in this book and does not go into as much detail his first book. So buy ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" and read it a couple of times and then you will not have to spend your money on this one."
1,"If you like infomercials, then you'll love this book","Supposedly, this book is about learning to invest wisely. What it actually is, is a blatant infomercial about the author's own daily newspaper. If explained at all, the financial metrics for evaluating stocks are generalized to the point that they are absolutely useless. The whole book can be paraphrased into one sentence...""if you want to be a successful, you should subscribe to his newspaper."""
2,There is a free lunch,"New investors should simply go directly to Fool.com, the home of Motley Fool, and read the 13 steps to successful investing. It costs nothing. There are message boards teeming with information about every security. If you like, MF has books for sale too. But in the end, you;ll learn more from the community of people like yourself than from any one salesmen of a system or idea."
2,It is good but....,"This book is actually a good one, but the problem is that a similar content can be accessed on the internet. Investors.com in the IBD learning center section have a simplified version of the book. This is actually disappointing."
3,Extended promotion for Investor's Business Daily...,"Just finished ""24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success"" by Bill O'Neil, who happens to be the publisher of Investor's Business Daily. Consequently, the book is more or less an extended commercial for the paper -it is an investor's guide, but an investor's guide as applied to using Investor's Business Daily.However, there's a good balance of information here. If you can steer past the obvious bias, he has some good tips I'd like to try out some day. He presents a formulaic approach for success in the market - not too conservative nor too risky. It certainly makes good sense. And it's obviously worked well for him."
2,A Great Commercial,Some of ONeil's 24 Essential Lessons are good if you can decipher between the actual lesson and the advertising for his Investors Business Daily publication.
5,The author keeps educating individual investors,"This is a short and easy-to-read book that provides individual investors with essential lessons to find investment success. The author says that the most important lesson that investors should follow is to cut investment losses after an 8% decline.Unlike other investment books that either preach following fundamental or technical analysis, this book recommends using both before making purchasing and selling decisions. Fundamental analysis tells investors about the quality of the companies and technical analysis explains price movements. For those who master these lessons, investment success is more likely to happen.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
1,Horrible Book,"This book is nothing more than a 160 full-page advertisement for ""Investors Business Daily"". It contains a lot of buying/selling rules without any explanations as to why these rules work or as to how the author came up with these rules. Maybe I'm just not the person who would buy a stock solely based on the shapes of the stock and volume charts. (As an example, only 7 pages of this book are devoted to the fundamentals of companies. The remaining 150 pages are all about the shape of the stock chart!).If you really want to buy a good book, go and get ""One up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch and you'll know what I mean."
1,148 page advertisement for his daily paper,"I felt that this book was a 148 page advertisement for his daily paper the ""Investor's Business Daily"". Every page in the book mentions charts, graphs and information that could only be found in his paper, an order form for the paper is in the back of the book. I did get 3 or 4 pointers from the book but tired quickly of the constant reference to his paper. If anyone wants my copy its yours."
2,Nothing More Than a Poor Sales Campaign for IBD,"I purchased this book, hoping to learn more about technical analysis, and get some good investment tips. Instead, I found that the author does nothing more than try and sell his publication, ""Investor's Business Daily."" The entire book consists of references to IBD, and tells you how to utilize the newspaper. I am very disappointed, and would not reccomend anyone purchase this book."
3,Reviewed,I fortunatly read teh book and as a student studying finace I was able to learn a few things from teh book that they don't teach you in school. He did push his paper quite a few times. It did get a little annoying. I receive stuff all the time from his company in the mail trying to get me to buy a subscription I don't care to read about it. That was the only down fall of the book. I have found soem of the tips very useful when looking at annual reports.
4,You can get it free however...,"You are paying with your personal information. Name, Address, Phone... etc... who needs the hassle? Also, your mailbox is full of the newspaper daily for at least a week! Save a few trees and don't give out your personal info just to get the book free! Any costs associated with this book are well deserved for enduring the hassle in receiving it!"
4,Part Of Your Education,I read some of your reviews of this book and alot of you seem to express the view that this is just an advertisment for his newspaper. Your a little misguided. What you lrean from this book and his other's is that investing is a DAILY lreaning process. No one book (or CNBC) is going to give you all the knowledge. You must devote time daily to the markets and company's where you aim to invest your money. That is what this book is trying to tell you. If you paid attention to O'Neils CANSLIM Method over the last two years you would be in great shape now and looking forward to the next bull market with cash in hand!
1,"YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, SALES PITCH!","I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. MR. O'NEIL HAS A BRAND NAME IN THE BUSINESS OF INVESTING IN THE STOCK MARKET AND HAS MADE A FORTUNE OF IT. AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I CAME TO ONE CONCLUSION. IT WAS WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR TO TRY AND KEEP HIS NEWSPAPER BUSINESS ALIVE. WITH THE GROWING POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET, THERE IS A WEALTH OF FREE AND UP TO THE MINUTE FINANCIAL INFORMATION WHICH WILL MAKE PUBLICATIONS LIKE IBD, A THING OF THE PAST.IN ANY CASE, THIS IS A GUIDE OF HOW TO USE IBD (INVESTOR BUSINESS DAILY). IF THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN, THEN BUY THIS BOOK. OTHERWISE, AVOID IT. SHAME ON McGRAW HILL FOR PUBLISHING IT."
3,It was an Ok Movie,I liked it.. Nothing too scary but good. arrived on time in great condition. No complaints Just not a 5 star kinda movie.
2,NECESSARY NONSENSE,"POOR LANCE HENRIKSEN..ONCE CONSIDERED A TOP NOTCH ACTOR, HE FINDS HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN IN A REAL LOSER. A PLOT WITH MORE HOLES THAN SWISS CHEESE, A LEADING ACTRESS WITH LITTLE TALENT, HORRIBLE FX..IT'S NOT EVEN CHEESY..IT'S JUST BAD. I LIKE CAMPY BAD B MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE STINKS."
3,"Beautiful bright colors, but it stains your hands!","This is great clay, but it stains your hands immediately. The colors are bright and the clay is easy to use to create little sculptures. Unfortunately, my 7 year old will not use it because it stains her hands for days."
5,An spellbinding page turner that you won't put down.,"A intresting insight into the callousness of the human soul and our blood thirstiness for power. It shows our kindness and love can come from another part of the galaxy and that human nature is corruptive and blind. Well written from beginning to end, you are likely to stay up into the small hours of the night reading every page."
4,interesting...,I enjoyed the idea that we are the bad guys. I think that writing a whole 300 something page novel is a pretty fantastic feat in itself. Also the thought provoking philosophical aspects really were great.
1,"Awful, just awful!","Was looking forward to this for some time and hoped there would be SOMEthing to enjoy, but my worst fears have been realized. A washed-out print with what looks like video credits - in French; just hit play and you'll get a German soundtrack - has a hard-to-navigate menu which makes it difficult to find the English soundtrack. Trying to watch this on a 110"" screen was impossible, in all respects. What. A. Disappointment. Where does the line form for refunds?"
1,BE WARNED,"Unfortunately I did not have a chance to check out other customer comments concerning this DVD. So, for those who do check first ....be WARNED. This is the worst DVD I have experienced to date. The quality is similar to an EP recorded video tape. The sound is terrible, and to be honest I had to shut my unit off after enduring only the first 5 minutes of the movie. Too bad, for the original VistaVision , Technicolor print was a gem when I ran it in the theatre. I'm disappointed in Amazon, for allowing such a slimy Company to sell their obvious duped product, on their web site. I have learned my lesson, and will not buy another (BARGAIN DVD) from an unknown company."
1,"Great movie, terrible DVD","My first DVD ripoff. I wouldn't think Amazon would even carry...like this. And one of the great American classics, too!"
1,Poor quality for a blu-ray disc and it's GERMAN!!,Just popped this Blu Ray into my player and the movie is in German. It looks like the titles are in French! The quality is very poor. This film was directed by Marlon Brando and I'm pretty sure he didn't make it in German with French titles! I have returned the Blu-Ray for refund. Glad that Amazon had pulled this product!
1,Such a waste,"Such a great movie but such a poor Blu-ray image. No closed captions, only stereo sound and with poor vocals. Pastel colors. Picture about like a standard DVD. Apparently a foreign transfer."
3,My Digiview version is NOT anamorphic,"After reading some reviews which praised the Digiview version of One Eyed Jacks, and having seen many bad releases in the past, I took the plunge and bought the Digiview release. Unfortunately, while the print is in widescreen, my copy anyway was NOT anamorphic. It is also still a poor quality copy with soft, faded edges and weak color. I suppose its the best version of the ones I have seen but a long way from being acceptable viewing on today's Hi-def TVs. When will someone get hold of the original negatives of this film and produce a quality release? Criterion, TCM are you listening?"
3,husband likes it,Everything with the order was fine. I can't really rate it because I don't watch it. My husband does. ok?
1,Trash posing as Blu-Ray,This supposed Blu-Ray disc of One-Eyed Jacks is nowhere near as good as my VHS version in EP. It is a joke. Amazon should remove this junk from its normal excellent selection. I'd prefer watching a full screen version on tv with commercials to this travesty.
1,Wow was the DVD bad!!,"I didn't think it would be possible to destroy a movie I so thoroughly enjoy. The soundtrack was so full of unbearable high pitched noise I had to struggle to watch the film. The reason this film is so exceptional is the beautiful panoramic shots of the Monterey area, but all of that was cut out. This DVD was many notches lower quality than any other version I have seen. Do not buy this!! What a shame to destroy such a grand western...."
4,It IS widescreen,"I also have the $1 DVD from Walmart, and the back is mislabeled. Don't let it fool you, it's widescreen and the transfer is great quality."
2,"Great movie, Horrible transfer!","Can't say enough about this movie. It is a favorite of mine. Brando's portrayal of the old western gunfighter is classic. This transfer on DVD is the worst I have ever seen. You dont buy a DVD player to watch movies like this. Better transfers are out there. Cable has aired crystal clear versions of this film in letterbox format, another weakness of this rendition. The video store was kind enough to refund my money. Buyers beware, if you haven't already you will soon discover not all DVDs are created equal. You may think 10 bucks is a steal for a DVD movie only to find when you get home the video tape is much better. I am still waiting for the definative DVD rendition of this film from Paramount."
1,Awful Picture Quality,"The picture quality on the Entertainment One ""Blu Ray"" disc is awful. Don't waste your money on it. To date, the best image quality for ONE EYED JACKS remains the Tgg Direct DVD released in 2003."
2,a tough watch,"OEJ is my favorite western.I think it is one of the best ever made...so when I heard it was coming in Blu Ray,I preordered a copy from Amazon,and could hardly wait to get it.I got it,and played Blue Ray OEJ that night.The transfer is a little better than TV,which makes for a transfer from hell.It looks to have some kind of 1080 seive over a previously bad transfer,the only digital remastering I saw was no remastering at all,the closer you get to the screen the blurrier the images get.This transfer is almost without color.The sound is OK.I don't really know how to describe the horrid opening titles(german i think).OEJ should be a Criterion project if ever there was a Criterion project or what about Coppola,Speilberg,and Scorsese,who loved and were affected by OEJ.I'm surprised one of them has not took on OEJ as a restoration project.Last but not least what happened to the director's cut which IS out there,I watched it while I was stationed in Vietnam at our outdoor theater(circa 1969)."
1,terrible transfer,"Don't get me wrong, One Eyed Jacks is a great film, but don't even consider buying this DVD. The transfer looks washed out, as if it had been done from a 15 year old betamax copy. The sound echoes badly from beginning to end and worst of all the picture breaks up completely about two thirds of the way through the film. Even though it's not a lot of $'s I beg of you don't buy this DVD."
3,This blu-ray is an exact transfer of the previous German release...,"...complete with poorly-rendered French main titles and consistently dull color. This is now a public domain title, so getting a good VistaVision version will take some doing. Only time will tell, but even a good print will probably require an expensive photochemical restoration to get a decent HD master."
1,Awful Product,"This is an awful product. The quality of the movie/image is very bad, like an illegal copy of a DVD copied million times and almost destroyed. The image isn't sharp at all and the colors are very bad quality, very watery. The cover of the box doesn't contain any traditional information about the movie aside from a very short synopsis; it lack absolutely any information about the director, names of the actors, year of production, etc. This is an awful, bootleg-quality like product, and I would never buy it had i known it earlier.Regards,Sylvia Stachnik"
1,"Beware! Great movie but ""Pain-staking remastered"" was a lie.",The master source for the Blu-RAy is the same old crappy picture quality that's been put on the DVD for years..Maybe One Eyed Jacks will be honestly re-mastered properly someday. Amazon was nice enough to send a return label.
1,Pitiful Blu-ray,"The qualility of this ""Blu-ray"" is not acceptable. It is awful. This isn't a review about the movie which is what Amazon wants. Amazon doesn't want a review that says the qualility is unacceptable. Don't buy. ""Remastered"" is a misrepresentation and Amazon should return all buyers funds."
1,Horrible Blu ray Quality,"First i have to say, i like this movie very much and i was so glad to hear it comes in the blu ray format.saying shortly, its horrible, catastrophal,just terrible.Picture its like an old vhs tape twenty years old and whats totaly wrong isthey wrote the sound is dts hd master 2.0.Forget it its a simple stereo no nothing Hd Master Audio.the movie itself earns a 4 star but this blu ray just a half star."
2,Great movie very poor video,The movie had it all and then some. Very interesting. My one big complaint is the very poor video quality. Don't know why but I would not recomend this version of the movie.
4,"a great western, good transfer","Five stars for the film ,three for the transfer. these comments are for the platinum disc corporation edition and thats important to know because while i have not viewed every dvd edition of one eyed jacks, you might be able to guess as i did that they are not all equal. As one reviewer noted, this one is a little soft and slightly dark but the images are clean and the color while slightly muted , takes on a kind of rembrantian hue and darkness; but not so dark as to spoil the color or mood. in some odd way it improves on the theme of the film.But it is not sharp; i dont think you will find that anywhere you look for this gem. If the definition of a classic is a film with at least five memorable scenes in it, you cannot deny ,one eyed jacks, though over long and uneven in parts, is a true american classic, with our finest modern screen actor at the top of his game."
5,BANDO!!,Brando is at his best in this film he directed. Karl Malden is wonderful as Dad Longworth. I love the expressions on their faces and the dialogue is great!
5,Visual Study in Betrayal and Revenge,"This moody Western is a film about betrayal and revenge directed by Marlon Brando. Brando's focus here is on characters. The way they walk, talk, eat, drink, dress, kill and die is poetic, enigmatic and disturbing under Brando's direction. This film is filled with overly beautiful photography and highly detailed sets.The film's opening credits seen over Hugo Friedhofer's score seem very traditional. As the camera moves into the bank it soon becomes apparent that images can be quite deceiving. In a film full of deceit and betrayal Brando's allegorical style slowly becomes clear. A strange and uneasy film it is remains offbeat yet very captivating."
1,This is NOT a widescreen version,"The reviewer ""B. King"" cites this version as ""letterboxed"" and the reviewer ""Michael C. Glancy"" says that it is widescreen. I ordered just this version, with just this cover picture, and it is NOT widescreen. Right on the back cover it states ""Standard Full Frame."" I did not punch open the cellophane to verify, in order to be able to return the item, and I suppose it is astronomically possible that the item was mislabeled, but I doubt it. The cover boasts that it is ""Digitally Remastered,"" and it may indeed be a better transfer than the other versions, but I shall have to forage further for the widescreen. Meanwhile, dear browser, be advised that your humble servant went to the trouble of ordering this item based on the testimony of the two gentlemen cited, and it arrived with ""Full Frame"" blazoned on the back cover."
2,One eyed Jacks,"I remeber the original and it was black and white,the color waspoor and the sound track,especially the dialog was very spotty.Ididn't realize this was colored over."
1,One Eyed Jacks,"The movie you sent me was in German. So I had to throw it away, and lost my purchase money. Someone screwed up right?"
3,This Version Of One Eyed Jacks 3 star rating!!,"I love This Movie! And always have, since it's Release in 1961.But It is in need of a restoration Badly. We are film lover out here, and like to see quality Films. Do not insult our intelligences by trying to sell use junk. This film is a classic and it deserves the best care you can provide."
1,A classic Brando western on a terrible DVD.,This video looks as if they recorded it off of a TV. I have Night of the Living Dead by Madacy and it looks about the same. DVD.Express would be well advised to take the Hollywood Classics collection out of the company inventory. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,....the first Italian western,"This fine film was taken away from Brando & butchered by the studio when he dallied too long over the editing. One Eye Jacks may be the first Italian western. The pace is leisurely; the scenery awesome; western cliches are dwelled upon & turned upside down (Slim Pickens drawls, ""You ain't gonna get any older than tomorrow."" Brando's Jesus-as-unredeemed-outlaw character is horsewhipped, crucifixion-style, by the hypocritical Karl Malden. Hugo Friedhofer's score is one of the finest ever composed for a Hollywood movie - he clearly admired Brando. Somewhere out there is the director's cut. Let's see it!"
4,One of a Kind Western,"Brooding outlaw Marlon Brando seeks to even the score with the former partner who double-crossed him (Karl Malden). Though a little disjointed at times, this film is otherwise so well crafted and performed that one easily can forgive any minor shortcomings. The supporting actors are uniformly excellent, the tension well-sustained, the setting beautiful, and of course, nobody else can be Brando. Highly recommended."
1,Don't ORDER THIS MOVIE,"This movie itself is an good movie however I ordered this movie in DEC. and it's now APR and it still was not sent, I don't know what the hell is up with amazon but I would never order another old film from them ever since they seem to never get them in stock anyways.Peeved off"
5,"Second only to ""On the Waterfront""",Excellent performances by both Brando and Karl Maulden combined with a very interesting story make this a must-see for all Brando fans.
5,Very Good DVD,"Too many customers have complained about the video quality of this movie. It is not top quality, but that is because it has not been digitally remastered. So this is the best that can be purchased. And in truth, it is not bad. It is very ""watchable"". I enjoyed it without any complaints. To top it off, this is one of the best westerns ever made. Most westerns are corny and trite; not this one."
1,One-Eyed Jacks,"The print on this dvd couldn't be any worse than it is.From the beginning the whole thing is so blurry and made worse by not showing it in the wide screen format as it was filmed but on a bad full screen version.Even the print on the dvd case is hard to read I tried using a magnifying glass to no avail.I wouldn't buy any other dvd from ""Synergy"" as I don't want to waste my money as I couldn't even continue watching the movie and threw it in the garbage can where it belongs.G. Gonzalez"
2,St Clair aint Clear,"My review is of the St.Clair Vision DVD. My copy is a turkey; better yet a jackass. Keys segments of the film are missing. I know cause I've seen it a few times before on a bargain basement DVD version that I lost. Based on my experience you'd be a lune to buy the St Clair version. I trust Amazon will do the right thing so I don't have to make a Federale case of this. The film is great, this purchase a no eyed Jack."
1,One-Eyed Jacks DVD Review,"I have purchased more than one DVD of this fine movie; however, each DVD has had terrible picture quality, as confirmed by a couple of other people. I wish other reviewers would also write something about the quality of the disk."
2,Don't buy the Madacy DVD,"As many reviewers have noted, the video quality is terrible in many editions. I have only experienced the Madacy edition -- that's the one where the cover has the original poster, surrounded by a white outline and the actors' names below -- and it's terrible. I will be sticking with my laser disk until (or if) Paramount releases a studio version. My two star rating is therefore an average of a ""zero"" for the technical quality of the Madacy DVD and a ""four"" for the movie itself (which features some of the most memorable dialog ever in a western, which I understand was in no small part due to Ben Johnson -- Brando would ask him, ""Ben, what's a better way to say that?"" and Johnson would come up with some wonderfully colorful expression like ""I hear there's dirt between ya"" or ""Don't be doin' her like that""). So pray for a studio edition, as this movie certainly deserves first class treatement."
1,Classic Western - problem with remastered copy,"I already own a DVD of this movie but ordered a Blu-Ray copy thinking that it will be a lot better product since it is remastered. It is not any better. It seems like it was produced out of the U.S., possibly Germany. The credits are in German, except for the names of course. The problem is in trying to navigate the menu to go to the English language version. The cursor just will not go where it needs to go. Unless my DVD player or remote is defective (I don't think so), the movie will start in German captioned in English. The set-up process left me frustrated I consider the item a rip-off."
1,Mastered by Clowns,W A F J .Grab a VHS copy and smear Vaseline on your screen to replicate the effect of this Blu Ray
3,Uneven biased coverage,"The author states clearly that on the Russian Campaign, this book will focus on the Northern and Southern flanks, mostly ignored in other books on Napoleon's invasion of Moscow. This coverage based on new and sometimes unfamiliar eye-witnesses' accounts constitutes the good bits about this book.The bad part is the clear anti-Napoleonic bias throughout the book, sometimes well-presented but at other times, made as sweeping statements without basis. It devalues the contents.This book would have benefitted from a strong editorial input."
1,The Californian Wildlife Region,"I certainly wasted my money on this one. No color photographs, only black and white drawings. Little useful information. Of no use to me at all."
4,good stories,"This dvd starts out with some info on the ""perfect storm"" incident in 1991 concerning the Andrea Gale fishing boat, but it is not all about this particular storm, it kind of generalizes other hurricane like storms,but seems to concentrate very much of the story on rescue missions for other smaller boats and with the ANG folks doing their thing, which is in itself, quite fascinating,and interesting, but the dvd is not entirely about that unusual phenomenan in weather that occured on 10-30-31-1991.I think they should've put more info and made more of a story about that storm than they did here."
3,The formula was changed and it isn't as nice to wear.,"When I original bought this product, it was cucumber and aloe vera and nothing else. When I bought the same product again, it had more unnecessary ingrediants than before, and I was not happy. I will be looking for something else."
4,Frickin Awesome,"Since the first time that i heard the single ""These Days"" off of this CD i was amazed at how good it was. I haven't heard but three songs on the Cd but they were all good so I'd say this is a good buy."
5,Awesome,"Ok, here we go, the first review for the long awaited sequel to ANThology. There new CD truANT sounds so good, whether your one of those people who dont like the popular songs on CD's but the more underground ones or the kind of person who enjoys the popular songs on CD's, I recomend buying this CD. The first single of this CD: ""These Days"", I will comfortable say this will be a classic song. truANT is one of those CD's that you can keep playing in your CD player and wont have to change the track. A must for alternative fans. Thanks for your time.If you would like to contact me my SN is JohnyQ10. Thanks"
2,losing it,"aaf has obviously rushed this cd because of their accident. besides for these days, this album is much worse than what i expected."
5,DIFFERENT / BUT STILL GREAT!!!!!!,"The first time I played this album I was a little scared that AAF has lost thier kick, but after a few plays I fell in love with it. This is a must buy for any rock fan PERIOD!!!!"
3,Not a Sophmore Disaster,"Alien Ant Farm's second release ""TrANT"" does not cross into the ""file under sophmore jinx"" albums. It was produced by Robert & Dean DeLeo of STP and you can definately feel the influnce of the DeLeo brothers on this album. Continuing where ""ANThology"" left off, AAF produce catchy, up beat rock songs that reflect a new polish thanks to the DeLeo brothers. This album will prove that there is more to this band than a Michael Jackson cover song!"
2,ehh,its weak compared to their first album. glow and these days are as best as it gets. Rest of the album is much filler and really lacking that emotional punch that was strive for on classics like calico and attitude.
5,Underappreciated Album,"This album is amazing from start to finish. Heavier than the first even though the lyrics are sometimes odd but that's what they are. This was the last to feature Corso on guitar and it was spectacular. TruAnt is definitely their best album, better than the first in my opinion."
2,Average Let Down,"I bought the album truANT thinking that it would be as great as ANThology. Was I wrong. The lyrics were absolutely ridiculous!'We'll take a trip for..around the world', 'I'll be the bumblebee behind you, baby' and 'I'll think of something positive and negative too'? What was that? That made no sense, and if it does to anyone out there, good for you. Alien Ant Farm went to pop, and badly too. What happened to this album?!"
1,What?,I want my money back. It must suck to be in a band that will be remembered only for its Michael Jackson cover. Pathetic. Go buy a Tool or King Crimson album.
3,AAF comes back with a good album,"After recovering from a tour bus crash, AAF release their second album, TruANT, which I have to say is not as good as ANThology, but almost as good. With the single These Days, and the opening guitar chords of 1000 Days, and some acoustic tunes make this album worth purchasing, especially for the bonus DVD with concert footage. AAF takes a step back from the limielight and plays music in a more non-commercial way. After banging up the charts with ANThology, and it's extreme popularity, these guys are ready for a low profile album, which still rings the tunes of AAF's signature sound."
5,Best wiper blades,"These have to be the best wiper blades on the market. I had purchased them for my previous car a couple of years ago, and now that my newer vehicle was needing wipers, of course I wanted Bosch Icons. But, they must be pretty popular, because they are always sold out at the local retailers. Luckily for me I found them here on Amazon, ordered them Sunday and they arrived today (Friday), even after the seller said there would be a delay because they were awaiting their shipment. I put them on right away, and they work like a dream. My windshield is so clear it looks as if it has been replaced as well. Don't waste your time or money on other wipers, get these and rest assured that you'll always have a streak free finish on bad weather days. They were super easy to install by myself, and I am girly-girl. Didn't even break a nail!"
5,Sweeeet strong blades,"Just awed by how strong they were. I dont usually buy the Icons, but I have heard so much about them. When I saw the rebate I just had to try.These blades look good, do their job well. No streaks, and when they go to work, they leave a clean windshield and a satisfied driver.I would buy them again!PS - if your car has a hook as the holder, this blade is for you. Installation took 30 secs in the dark. Just snap, shut and you are done. This fits the Passat 2002 V6 contrary to the guide Amazon has."
4,"good yarn, but dark","I'm really very happy with this yarn. I'm a beginning knitter and was a little nervous about purchasing a yarn without much direction, but I'm very glad I did. The yarn strength, width, and softness is perfect. The only reason I rated it 4 stars and not 5 is because the yarn is so dark it is almost black. You can't tell that it's blue."
5,why oh why,....have you stores stopped carrying this color??!!! I LOVE this color! It is soooo beautiful! I wish the stores would carry it again.
4,Great Bag,I have this bag in purple. I have received lots of compliments and people do stop me to ask about it! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that I think the handle or strap is too short if you need or want to put it on your shoulder. The bag is well made and attractive. Be aware that the bag is a bit heavy--so if you carry a lot of junk it could get really heavy!
5,"Beautiful, elegant, and eye-catching!","I bought this bag in Razzleberry. It's a gorgeous pink - not too bright, the photos don't do it justice. I'm in love with it! I've always been a seatbelt bag fan and this one takes the cake! The chrome hardware is so shiny and this bag is the strongest bag I own. The only thing I would mention is the zipper is a bit hard to use because of how heavy the seatbelt material is. I prefer to simply use the latch across the top to hold in my items. Great bag, though!!"
1,Waste of time,"This review of Laurell K. Hamilton was a waste of time, and less informationa dn more out of date than her website."
1,Disappointed,Christmas 2008 I ordered the Green remote control dragonfly for my neice and she loved it. It was not very durable and only lasted about 2 months but she enjoyed it so much I thought it was a fairly good 'disposable' Christmas gift.This year I ordered the Red Hornet for the same neice and my granddaughter. BIG MISTAKE. One of them would never charge enough to actually work and the other wouldn't fly (not even across the room). It seemed the body was too heavy and just pulled it down. Both girls were very disappointed because they had truly enjoyed the Green one I got last year (even though the wings tore up after a couple of months).Not recommended - and too bad because it could be a really fun toy.
3,"Fragile, but fun","The toy is a lot of fun to fly, but the wings and tail are somewhat fragile. The metal rod in one wing broke after a a bad landing. After only ten minutes of flight, I had to replace the wings. There was an included set of replacement wings, but I can't find an available source for future replacements.If WowWee doesn't start providing the replacement parts, I wouldn't suggest you buy this for your child."
3,Boa meets Python,"Although they make a small reference to Greg Larson from Python and Python II, they were unable to take it farther because Boa vs. Python is a Columbiua Tri-Star release and Pythons are 20th Century Fox, so the film really has no connection, not even to Boa, which is distributed by Columbia Tri-Star as well. Since Python II and Boa were released in 2002 they're CG effects are a little outdated. Ok, alot outdated. Now it's 2004 and the snakes are a little more clearly generated, but they're not up to par with modern effects. The story is a little different from the other three entries in the series, but nothing too surprising. Nudity, blood, violence, and bad language are all prominent in the film, so keep it away from small kids. It's not the best, and the ending is pretty abrupt. The movie is technologically better than the other three movies, but it's not a better movie."
2,For boys of all ages,"My 9 year old son picked this out from the video store and begged me to rent it. I kept my finger on the ""off"" buttom due to the R rating but I never had to use it. The movie was way too stupid to be offensive. I really don't understand why the producer didn't shade the few nude scenes and tone down the four letter words. He should have aimed for a PG rating because preteen boys seem to be the target audience for something this juvenile."
3,Another Snake Feature,"First off let me say that I'm a big fan of the big snake movies, but this movie was kind of dissapointing. One reason, the CG was odd, the snakes looked cartoonish with their huge bulgy eyes and their bright color. Another reason was the corny taglines the character Broddick kept saying like, ""We're in Python country."" and, ""How do you like you meat?"" Last, the python looked no different from the boa other than their color. If you, like me, are a fan of snake movies than you might want to give this movie a chance, but if you aren't, then forget that you ever even heard about this movie."
3,Dated Account of the Reformation,"Chadwick's perspective on the Reformation Era contains a lot of great material for those interested in learning about the important and notable historical factors in the Age of Theological Reform. His work is dated in number of respects however, and should be read in conjunction with a more recent work of scholarship. Chadwick is also rather hard to fact-check in his own work, as he fails to directly cite sources for a number of his claims. His overall perspective is solidly historical; however, this book should not be read and understood as a critically-accurate account of the Reformation."
2,Looking for a balanced study of the Reformation?,"Don't look here.Chadwick's book is steeped in the conventional and now-discredited ""Whig"" view of history, which posits that the Reformation was both inevitable and progressive. It is typified by sentences like the following from Chadwick: ""The Reformation came because limitation of the power of the Church was necessary to the further development of efficient government.""This view has since been demolished by the likes of Eamon Duffy, who has shown that much of the Reformation was a violent, top-down imposition -- a ""revolt of the rich"" as another scholar put it.Readers are advised to consult Diarmaid MacCulloch's masterful ""The Reformation: A History,"" a book likely to be the standard work on the subject for years to come."
3,"Adequate, but...","The only other short introduction to the Reformation that I've read is the one by G.R. Elton, and this one is not as good. Chadwick treats his subject casually and judges movements or people without making us privy to the reasons why he does so. There are also inexplicable biases in what is treated: for example, he gives us quite a few pages (a chapter?) on the religious life of England under Cromwell (1640s and 50s), but barely spends more than a sentence or two on the religious wars in France (1562-98).On the whole, the tone wasn't my thing either. On the few occasions he referred to women (remember them?) it was in an casual and sometimes apparently joking way. Not quite sexist, but it makes you wonder.Skip it. There are hundreds of histories of the Reformation. Most will be better than this."
2,Slow,"I've tried to read this, but made little headway. Like many books written in that era it seems to take a lot of time to get to the point of the story. I finally gave up and deleted it from my Kindle."
2,Deathrider,"This is one of those albums that sometimes is trendy for people to claim a thrash classic. After the first track there is nothing really to praise whatsoever. I never really cared for this and much preferred ""Spreading the Disease"" and ""Among the Living."" And don't get me started on Neil Turbin, it's not like I really ever was a fan of Joey either, but this guy is so far from satisfactory. He sounds like a bad Paul Baloff, and since every thrash singer typically sounded like a bad James Hetfield, well you get the idea."
2,pure thrash... oops i meant trash,"this thrash metal or whatever it's called is disgusting. it shouldn't be listened to! these guitar...um.... riffs are sorta fast so it isn't memorable. and the drummer only uses double bass drums which get boring real quick. for real music you gotta check out eminem. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because anthrax was in taht one chappelle show episode. I dunno what you metal heads like to listen to, but for ppl like me, avoid this! the only reason i bought this is because anthrax's and public enemy's ""Bring the noise"" was good. i guess i was wrong...."
5,[...]kicking album,"I am by no means an Anthrax lover or follower. However, I rank this album up there with ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Rust In Peace"" if I want an album to get my adrenaline up. This is a [...]-kicking, awesome-sounding heavy metal album. It is guaranteed you will lift 10 extra pounds more in the weight room or not need your coffee in the morning after listening to this album. Every song is great except ""Eighteen"" (which I skip over).Warning though- this album does sound way different than many other Anthrax albums, including there more popular album, ""Among the Living"". That is probably why I like this album ;-)."
4,Classic Thrash in the long hair days,"This album is awesome overall. I liked several songs on this album. My favorite was the Alice cooper remake ""Im eighteen"". Anthrax definitely sped up the song and added more guitar solos in it. theres several good songs on this album i would recommend this album to anyone true to the roots of true metal."
1,"Great Albums, Horrible Release","Classic albums, unfortunately, the quality of this release sounds like it is sourced from very low quality mp3s. Buyer beware. Look to buy the original releases instead. You will be more satisfied."
3,It's a beginning,"The truth is somewhere in between the last 2 reviews. I wasn't exactly floored the first time I heard this album. It this is a really strong musical effort suffering from subpar production and subpar vocals. I can't really fault the band for either, since they were pretty broke when they released this and the vocalist was gone after this album, but those still keep this from being one of the band's best IMO. That's what makes the new ""Greater of Two Evils"" compilation worth getting. Just check out the video for the new version of ""Deathrider"" (available free on launchyahoo.com) and see what good production and John Bush's vocals can do for this album's material. And if Jillian can see that hear that new version and still say Anthrax sucks, he/she is as tonedeaf as the last reviewer said."
1,Horrid Remaster,"The reviewer James Prosser stated that it sounds like mp3's were used when doing this reissue. I have been thinking the same thing the past year or so that I've owned this.It makes me think that we are truly living in a sad age when music is done on the cheap, and that fans seem to be just as apathetic as the musicians themselves.Not all is terrible, at least metal is on the upswing again, but its releases like this that are truly showing its a scary time in music.The album? Its classic early thrash seasoned with some incredible hooks and vocals.This ""remaster""? It seems like they took the original songs, compressed them into mp3 format (or similar) and smooshed them onto the cd.I am 100 % serious with this assumption. As someone who has downloaded thousands of mp3s, but also owns thousands of cds, tapes and records, I know the difference between the two.Too bad the people behind this rerelease pulled a fast one with this."
4,Their 1st and their best...,"Pioneering early 80's thrash metal from Anthrax that, while lacking in the production department, exudes energy, excitement and power. Original singer Neil Tubin's only disc (before being replaced by Joey Belladonna), his vocal performance ranks up their with the genre's best. Also in the band was bassist Dan Lilker, who went on to to form S.O.D. Nuclear Assault and Brutal Truth. The disc is a thrash metal classic with balls to the wall tracks ""Deathrider"", ""Metal Thrashing Mad"" and ""Anthrax"". Maximum damage done despite the terrible, hide-the-guitar production from Carl Cannedy (who at the time was fronting his own band called The Rods). Without question, this was Anthrax's finest hour (""Among The Living"" running 2nd) and an essential disc to have in your thrash metal collection."
4,great re-package of the vinyl version of the beginnings of anthrax,"This review is for the Vinyl 3x10 inch version of Anthrax-Fistful of Metal. What this truly is the same as the 2000 Fistful of Metal/Armed and Dangerous re-master CD that came out, but spread across a unique approach to vinyl, three 10"" red vinyl records. The sound is what one expects from how they recorded back in 1983, loud, fast, and with a lot of treble. Overall, though, classic songs like death rider, metal thrashing mad, and soldiers of metal never sounded better. The Armed and Dangerous is also the same as the CD listing, and I really like this version of armed and dangerous on this album. Finally, the package on this I though was cool. It is a bit difficult to get the vinyl to of the slip sleeves, but the head with a fist coming out of it's mouth is cut out on the first flap and overlaid onto the anthrax logo on a black background, very cool. Overall, a good price that Amazon is selling it at for a unique item. Thrash on."
3,5 star album..,"However, the 92 re-release has crappy sound quality with cracking and popping nice during the songs. So, three stars for this version of the album."
5,I'm loving it!,"Anthrax is one of the greatest thrash bands of all time. And, although, they debuted in 1983-the same year Metallica and Slayer came out-they never were as good as them. In fact, Megadeth, who debuted a year later, were probably a little better. Nonetheless, I'm very content with this album. I think Neil Turbin's vocals are awesome and unique. I think Thrax always had good singers. I'm glad they became who they are today."
3,Good But Not Great,"This album would have the makings of a classic if it were not for the poor sound quality. Although this album is good, and I do recommend picking it up, get Volume 8 first."
5,"A pain to install, but a good filter.","Had to buy an icemaker installation kit from wal-mart to install, but works great after that. Water taste slightly distilled and ice is squeaky clean."
4,Costly cartridges.,"I've had mine for about six years, without problems, and the water tastes better through it. I don't know why the replacement cartridges cost more than the whole filter unit, $2 more at last check. My unit is actually a countertop filter (hole drilled through sink, chrome spigot) that no longer seems available, but it uses the GXRLQR filter cartridge and the same GXRLQ housing (mounted under the sink)."
3,Good tasting water but replacement design flaw,"The water tastes great and according to the fact sheets filters out some particles and spores. However, there is a design flaw with this model, after a couple of filter replacements, the nubs at the top of the filter do not reach high enough to trigger the release in the manifold to release enough water and it dribbles out.This problem happened to me too, but can be fixed with a garden hose plastic washer inserted at the top of the filter. Use a thin washer or a used washer for best results. See the discussion at ""FixYa"" site, search for ""GXRLQR"""
4,Simple and Good,"Ignore the games. Ignore the cutsey stuff. Most especially ignore the ""journal"" parts. (I don't know about you, but I don't need to keep a diary of ramen moments!)All this aside, please go ahead and buy this book. The recipes are simple and good."
3,Not so great,"I bought this book thinking it would be fun. I know how to cook and can easily concoct my own recipes, so I wasn't looking for something that would teach me how to cook. Actually, I think this book is designed precisely for that group. I was expecting some really novel ways of using these little noodles, but I was disappointed.If you don't know your way around the kitchen then this could be a great buy for you."
5,Excellent story,"The video is an excellent true documentary. A true documentation closely related to Remember the Titans. Whether you are a sports fan or not the story passes on a powerful message of hard work, dedication and humanity."
3,Good casual ring,"The sizing of this ring ran a bit small. I actually had to send back and reorder a larger size. This could be because the ring is rather wide. It is nicely made and has held up for over a year of near constant wear. Be aware that the space between the links is a dark and the overall look is rough, not a smooth link. This is more of a ""tough"" style than a polished finish look."
2,Misleading,"I have just received this ring today and upon opening its package my first thought was: ""Is this a joke? Did they send me the wrong ring??""Take a close look at the picture and what do you see? You see a very, very heavy looking ring that looks like it can take a beating. What do you get when you actually get this ring? You get a thin little band that is slightly less then 7mm wide. 7 millimeter = 0.7 centimeters!! How do I know this so easily? Because I have rings that are 7mm wide and this is not even that wide in comparison! So thats right! You get a ring that is less than 1 CENTIMETER WIDE!My advice, look elsewhere for a ring. This thing is so frail that I could snap it between two fingers. I have had this ring in my wishlist for almost 2 years now and when I finally break down and order it, I find out that it looks absolutely nothing like the picture advertises. Talk about severe disappointment. Old Glory, you have lost a customer today with me."
4,Excellent Primer,"As a storage novice coming at storage with a networking background, I found this book to be an excellent introduction to storage. The book is particularly effective at illustrating how intertwined storage infrastructure can be (you can solve the exact same problem with fundamentally different approaches - application, volume, array-based solutions). Networking is relatively straightforward by comparison."
4,A great reference book,"Reading this book I have learned as much on file system, volume management, database I/O as I have learned on SAN. It gave me a better understanding of the storage problem I was trying to solve and great pointers on the pitfalls to avoid and where focus should be when building a SAN.A ""must have""."
1,good TOC but no content,"I bought this book because I needed to figure out what problems SAN can solve for me, and how exactly to solve them in a cost-effective way using products available today. I found no answers to my questions in this book.The table of contents lists all the important topics, but the content is, well ... missing. What you find there is ""general concepts"" that you probably already know.This is not a book for enginners or system designers. It is probably good enough for a sales person or an IT/PR type. She can pick all the right buzz words from the book but will know no meaning of them.Needless to say, I returned the book. I still give it one star because it is well manufactured and has good illustrations - a lot of work must have gone into it."
4,what's left after cant,"Its true. Reading Markson is like a validation of one's education. The reader encounters the known and the faintly known in precise, almost monadic, moments. There is a sly narrative behind all this but it's a non-event- the real stuff is the telling anecdote, the revealing humaness and culpability of the living and their witnesses: artists themselves. Everything pushes towards annihilation, except pleasure. This book is a one of many."
4,Solid hardcore band,"These guys rock out. A mix of melodic lines and screeching vocals make the singer sound like he's suffering from a great physical pain. Great guitar riffs. Reminds me of the Deftones a lot. If you like a heavier P.O.D., check these guys out!!!"
1,It was falling apart!!!,"I bought the book because it said it was in good condition. I expected it to be used and maybe even have some writing in it but the book was in shocking condition. As I read the book, it slowly broke at the binding and was in pieces. I couldn't believe this is the book that was considered good condition. I will never buy a used book from amazon again. Not worth the money you save when the book is falling apart."
4,Educational Psychology,i can't submit a review for this book because i re-sold it the instant i got it
4,"wonderful book for Christians and ""seekers""","If you are a Christian female or a female curious about Christianity, I highly suggest you read this fine piece of fiction, which is both highly entertaining and educational as well. I plan on rereading it soon. It is about a young woman who grows up when her family moves and experiences many struggles. Julie learns to make her faith in God her own (instead of just relying on her folks' faith) and falls in love for the first time. This is definitely a coming of age novel, although I think most females ages 13 to 80 would enjoy it. My mom recommended it to me when I was about 17.I can't help wondering why this excellent book wasn't made into a movie or tv series like Christy was. I hope someday soon it is. It has to be true to the book, thought, like Christy was. Otherwise it will fail."
3,An okay read,"Julie is a young woman who falls in love for the first time, while her family faces many problems. While the book is interesting, it's also a bit preachy, and I quickly tired of hearing about the Promise Keepers. And now that I think about it, Rand was really kind of a creep, leading Julie on. I didn't think that their love story was very romantic...it was more annoying to see how bipolar he was.Having said all of that, it's not as good as Christy, but it's not a bad read."
3,A bit disappointing,"This book was a bit of a disappointment after reading Christy. Christy is so well written, and Julie just didn't live up to it. It's ok, but not great."
3,fast delivery,it was ok I thought it would have been a bit more exciting. I thought that she could have put a bit moe action in the story.
2,beautiful but difficult to set,"This watch is beautiful, but not very functional. In an effort to make it water tight Momentum has made it very difficult to set the time, date and alarm. First you have to unscrew the crown. After that you pull the crown out to the first position for date/alarm or second position for time. Unfortunately, the positions are difficult to find and the first position overlaps with the screw threads for the water seal. What you'll find is that the date will get messed up whenever you attempt to make any adjustment -- time, date or alarm -- and it's very difficult to set and keep the alarm setting, because when you attempt to tighten down the crown it changes the alarm setting.Cute watch. Just don't try to set the time, date or alarm and you'll get years of happiness from it."
4,Stretch,"I bought this book because i hate to stretch. I am liking it so far, because it is helping me with many Stretchesand my flexable."
5,Pratical help that works,"It is a very simple book; if you are looking for an in depth scientific or technical book you are looking in the wrong place. This book tells you what you need to know to stretch any area in your body, and tells you how to do it simply and properly. It has helped me to be more aware of muscle tension, and it has made a noticeable decrease in overall body tension in just a week. I would recommend it to a friend."
5,Excellent guide to flexibility,"This book is a great ""how to"" for warming up, fitness, and flexibility exercises. It's diagrams and quick, simple instructions make it very easy to use.After about three weeks of using the various exercises my body feels better than it ever has!"
3,Nice reference but not instructional book.,"Very good illustrations, but pretty poor content, nothing revealing, no new ideas, just the same classical stretches.It does not even make any difference between a stretching to flexibility training.I do stretch my facial muscles but I dont really intend to make them more flexible, so author's instructions about ""easy stretch"" phase and the building phase are not relevant in the case of simple stretching designed to warm up your muscles.Nice reference but not instructional book."
4,Love it - I would only change one thing...,"I LOVE this book! Great stretches, great diagrams. The only thing I would change (and I thought they did this at one time) would be to add a spiral bind so that the book lies flat when you open it."
3,It's a replacement of a prior edition that I loaned out.,It's not as well laid out as the prior one. The illustrations could be clearer. I wouldn't buy it again.
5,Classic,"This book has been offering people stretches forever!So many to choose from and the reader is able to hit every major muscle group in thier body. Easy to follow and useful for all fitness levels. Sports related stretches for all types of events so you will never get bored. Also recommend The Backsmart Fitness Plan by Dr.Adam Weiss- great stretches, dumbbell workouts for a full body workout, I combined these two books for great results."
4,the best source for stretches,Well organized and written. Simple examples to follow based on activities.
5,good for those who use computers all day long,"I'm a computer programmer, and the pain in my hands had gotten quite severe, to the point of considering changing careers. I thought it might be arthritic, but the doc disagreed, and ""prescribed"" this book for me. The three pages on finger, hand, and office-related stretches were worth the price of the book to me; 95% of my pain has cleared up."
4,Stretching made simple!,"This book has great drawings of showing you the correct and incorrect ways of doing the different stretches. I only wish this version (20th anniversary) was put in a spiral binding, so the pages would lay flat when you're trying to do the exercises!"
1,Didn't help me,"I got this book soon after it first came out and I got nowhere with it. The book uses static stretches. Static stretching has since been shown to actually tighten muscles - in fact, worse than ballistic stretching. And you should never stretch before an activity beyond a few dynamic stretches.The stretches in this book hurt my muscles and definitely lowered my performance in sports. I kept on doing the stretches anyway because it seemed like it should work. I regret that.I would recommend a different technique over simple static stretching - either active isolated stretching or relax-contract stretching for real results."
3,Stretching: 20th Anniversary (Stretching),"Well I really would like to review this book, it seemed excellent and I had heard really great things about it - even from my gym instructors.However after over a month I still havent received and now I have to haggle with Amazon about it. Boo !"
1,WORTHLESS!,"This book rarely mentions specific muscles. It teaches you to stretch certain areas of the body: lower back, front of shoulders, etc.IF you are looking to stretch SPECIFIC MUSCLES, this book is totally worthless. For example, because of a medical problem, I need to stretch a specific muscle, which of course is not to be named or found anywhere in this book.IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL PROBLEM AND YOU NEED VERY SPECIFIC INFORMATION, YOU WILL NOT FIND IT IN THIS BOOK.This book is written for children or the general population looking for a General Stretch in general areas.IF you are looking to stetch specific muscle groups, do a search on the internet, don't waste your money on this book!! On the internet, there are videos and pictures that are much more specific and helpful than this book."
1,"book ""Stretching"" by Bob Anderson","This book was recommended by my physician and he told me I could order it on Amazon.com. I was so looking forward to receiving it. The book arrived yesterday, in good condition, but in a foreign language. It should have been noted on my order that this book was not written in the English language. It's useless to me. I hope The Book Community can fix this problem."
5,Recommended by Physical Therapist,I suffer from major low back pain. This is the book my physical therapist used to show me different stretches to do. I decided why not buy the same book for myself. I am very pleased.
5,great book,"Book has tons of great sretches available to try. It is very comprehensive and is well researched, written with understanding."
5,Excellent Book,"I purchased this book after having borrowed an older version of it from a friend.This edition is updated, and even more wonderful than its' predecessor. It includes stretchesfor computer users.I love the way the author has broken the exercises down into categories of activities (sports)that people play.This book can help anyone; From the least active to the most active.The illustration is marvelous, and the explanations easy to understand.This book helps to make me more limber, and care for my back. I would recommend it to everyone!Athlete or couch potato, if you want to move better, buy it!"
5,One of the best fitness book,"It is one of my preferred exercise books. It's very easy to follow the routines, due to a very good structurated combination of excercises instructions and drawings. I ussually run and I used to make certain stretching exercises, however now that I have tried the book guidelines of how to stretching and the routines included in the book, I realized that I was stretching in a wrong way. I ussually stretch in the morning, after been seating for a long time and before going to bed and I feel really great!!"
1,TV @nywhere Plus,"Like Toby's review, my card also had a European PAL connector. Although they included an adapter in the box, it reduces the signal quality causing the reception to be snowy and not sharp. With that said, I had problems getting a refund from the merchant ANTONLINE. Stay away from this card. For a few bucks more you can get and much nicer TV tuner card (Happauge 1600 PCI)"
1,Part did not fit my computer,Product did not fit my computer. Returned product. Company has had product now for two weeks and I still havent seen my refund
2,TV@nywhere Plus,"This card came with a PAL (European) connector, not an NTSC (coax) connector. I had to purchase an adapter to make it work. When I finally got it working, the quality of the recording was far below what I expected. Perhaps it was caused by the PAL/adapter connection, but there was no way to tell. So I returned the card for credit. I had been using an older TV@nywhere card for about 4 years with no problems until it stopped recording audio for some reason. I'll probably purchase a replacement, but this time I'll be sure to get the NTSC connector."
5,Very simple to use. No problems at all.,I purchased this tv tuner to convert/backup VHS tapes to my hard drive. Installation was simple. Install tv tuner card into pci slot. Install software and that is it. It worked perfectly using windows vista. The recording software works well. I had to choose the directory that I wanted to save the video to and the quality setting. Press play on the VCR and push the record button on the software. Once completed a instant backup that will last forever.
3,Gets the job done,I bought this so I can watch cable ready on my pc at work. That's about all it's good for. The software and the remote control don't work very good.
2,MSI TV card,"Wasn't impressed with this card. The controller software looks like it's designed for a pre-teen, and it's not easy to set up (It could be that a 5th grader is smarter than I am!). Great if all you want to do is watch TV on your PC (recording showss another is another thing). I ended up giving this one away and bought a Hauppauge PVR350 (sp?) which does everything I want it to, easy to use and doesn't make me feel embarrased when friends see the interface in my screen"
4,Good enough for the price,"As many people said, disconsider the included CD if you are planning to install it on Windows Vista. Download all the drivers and software from the MSI website. Works fine, good picture quality. Works well with Windows Media Center."
2,Pass...,"I bought this because it was cheap, and use it in a linux computer running motion connected to a security camera. I could never imagine using this for tv. The quality is that bad. REALLY. It is. For the purpose I'm using it for it's ok. Mine came with an adapter from the PAL connector to regular coax, check the box."
2,I expected more,"Schiffman does a good job of outlining the dos and don'ts of starting your own business. As a small business owner, I was looking forward to reading the book.However, like many business books, this book disappoints. All you get is common sense solutions and advice. While I did manage to get a few pieces of advice that I can use, I didn't snag much more than that."
5,Great Device,I should have purchased this years ago. This is a great accessory and is built VERY well.
1,don't waste your money,I bought a set of these using a amazon $20 gift certificate so I thought I would be getting a great deal. The knives I received were so dull I could run my fingers across them length wise and not even start to cut my skin. I returned them and ended up being charged for the return shipment. No bargan here. I ended up with no knives and being out $10.00 I don't know if this was just a bad set or they had been damaged at some point as they were out of their Freud box but still wrapped in the protective paper inside the Amazon box. I will be buying a set of Amana from a local supplier. They will cost more but at least I know that they will be sharp.
1,The ads list Wrong size,"I ordered Freud co12 planer knives they came 12inch long not 13inch like the ads says. I called Freud Mfg. they said they don't make a 13""x7/8""x1/8"" planer knives just 12inch long in that size."
4,Simply funny,The other rules is one of the best books I have ever read. And even though I wont pratice all the rules(but some of them) I think it is quite good book for entertainment and it gives a lot of great tips for women.It's definitely worth the money i spend for it
1,UGH!,"I am absolutely disgusted by these so-called ""Other Rules""! I am a strong believer in the real ""Rules"" (by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider)! This offensive book should REALLY be called ""THE RULES FOR GETTING H.I.V.""! By the way this horrible book does not even deserve one star but they made me fill out the field!"
4,Great Insights into Enterprise Security Concepts,I really liked this book for following reasons:-Content is well organized-Lots of diagrams showing different network toplpogies-For novoices and experts
2,NOT FOR ME.,"I tried using Profibe for two weeks. I didn't think I would have an issue since I use Metamucil 2-3 times a day. Unfortunately while taking this product I was NOT able to be in public, if you know what I mean. Maybe they should change the name to Clear the Room!"
5,One Of The Funniest Movies Of All Times.,"I would have to say that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.Of course you must be a fan of slap stick/misc comedy. This is a very silly/quirky/weird film.If you like films like Airplane or Mel Brookes films , etc then you will most likly find this film amazing."
5,Great for kids who are between Barney and Bond,"This movie was great for my 8 and 10 year old boys. The extent of the profanity was a three letter word for backside. There were no four letter words, and no frontal nudity, and the most sex we saw was a tongue 'fight'. Bloodless violence. The sight gags and jokes were totally at their level (we, the parents, were cracking up too, but only because the kids were belly laughing the whole time). I recommend this for kids who have outgrown the Disney type flicks, but whose parents are not quite yet ready for them to watch James Bond. Well, OK, I cheated, I let my kids see 'The Matrix' last year. Good thing it was spoofed in this movie too, as it helped them get the cow scene! A thumbs up. Borrow a kid to watch it with. 'So cute...Bye Bye!'"
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Kung Pow has got to be one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. This movie is the true definition of ""stupid."" Now, some movies are stupidly funny (i.e. Austin Powers), but this movie is just flat out mindless. I'm even in to idiotic movies like these, but this movie disgusted me. I highly recommend you don't see it if you don't want to lose IQ points..."
1,sucked,"This movie sucked big time. I watched the whole movie and couldn't wait for the ending. I know they got a chines movie and changed it, but it just sucked."
1,Painful,"One of the worst movies I have seen in awhile. I laughed maybe a handful of times at best. I would never have rented this, but was corralled into watching it with some friends. Everyone thought it was terrible... which is saying a lot for some of my amigos."
1,TERRIBLE,This is one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life(ive seen A LOT of movies) It has about 3 funny parts and the rest of the movie is just ridiculously stupid. dont waste your money on this.
1,Ugh.. Bad bad bad bad^2,"Steve Oedekerk should stick to short films and writing. This movie was just horrible. If there was ever an option to vote no stars, this movie would be it. Sure, it's cool to see some modern movie effects in the movies, but the talent is wasted for this movie. This is more like a ""joke"" movie to put on your resume. The jokes in making fun of old kung fu movies works for the first 15 minutes, but then they just get old.I say save your (...money) and wait for the movie to come out on cable. At least then you could change the channel..."
1,So Bad It's Bad,"You've heard of movies that are so bad they're good? This isn't one of them. This movie is wretched. A couple of eighth-graders with an Imac could have done at least as well. It's like they painstakingly went through the film frame by frame and removed anything remotely humorous. At the end of my life, when the Grim Reaper comes to take me, I fully expect to ask for and get this hour and fifteen minutes of my life back."
2,it has its moments,this movie has its moments. but the stupidity of this movie is unbelieveable. if i seen this on cable i would have no trouble going to the restroom or answering the phone. because this movie suckkssss
1,Saying this is terrible is being too nice to it,This is a waste of the space time continuum. If you liked this you are as stupid as you are dumb.
1,My IQ has been lowered because of this movie,"I did not watch this movie on my own free will, I could not even sit through it. This was the only movie that I left the theatre half way through. The plot is horrible, the dialouge is atrocious, and the acting is even worse. Normally I like movies with subtitles, but the way they dubbed over the voices is just too annoying. The parts that were supposed to be funny were too dumb to laugh at. This movie needs to enter the ""Crap Movies Hall of Fame"" next to Showgirls."
1,SPARE ME THIS MOCKERY OF THE MARTIAL ARTS!!!!,"Kung Pow: Enter The Fist? Oh, bruddah! As if it needed a review. I mean, Toungie, Moon-Yu the Cow, MASTER ""BETTY"" PAIN?!?!?!? Please don't buy this wanna-be martial arts movie."
2,As silly as they come,"When I first saw this advertised I thought, ""Oh great, another stupid movie that goes for cheap laughs"". And I was right! The jokes are VERY silly, predictable, and I don't think they worked very hard on them. The only reason I saw this movie is because my friend kept quoting from it and telling me I should watch it. So we did. It's a good idea to edit the actors into old footage of kung-foo movies, but the parts that they made themselves (i.e. when he fights with the cow...) are very dumb. Obviously the people that made this have brains that work like this:FALLING DOWN + STUPID FACE = FUNNY. I don't agree with that logic. I mean, just look at the cover of this! Gopher-chucks? Why? I just don't get it! Really, don't waste your time on this movie unless you like really goofy and predictable things."
5,Movie is a classic. . .,"Movie is so funny, I can't get over how classic this is . . . Needs to be on Blu Ray, real talk mane ."
2,"Has a few laughs, but not worth the $20","The previews made it look funny; but ofcourse, the previews show the best parts! You don't have to be a kung-fu movie fanatic to get the jokes, you just have to appreciate a satire. Some people who don't understand satires and just saw it as a regular comedy will laugh but they will find the wacky antics a bit strange. The movie pokes fun at the voice dubbing by having annoying, high-pitched and deep voices replacing the actors own, but the joke gets tired halfway through. It has all the obligatory kung-fu characters: the old wise man, the evil, snickering enemy and his backup enforcement and a brave man avenging his master's death. The play on stereotypes and fight scenes were the funniest elements, but the film soon runs out of gas and ends up mocking itself. Not the worst movie but not worth the $20."
3,FUNNY..But No Kung-Fu Hustle,"After putting it off, I finally gave in to purchasing a copy of Kung-Pow, and what can I say...the clumsy Bruce Lee-like main character, the 70's chop socky spoofs, Matrix rip-offs, kung-fu cows,GOPHER chucks, and French aliens ALL made this film a worthwhile last, one of the craziest of it's kind since the Kentucky Fried Movie...but nothing that would hold a candle to the likes of Shaolin Soccer or Kung-Fu Hustle in my opinion. FUNNY..but not a classic, buy Shaolin Soccer and/or Kung Fu Hustle instead for something more potent and a lot less stereotypical."
4,YOU WILL LAUGH!,"KUNG POW is one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen, and it's also sidesplitting. Writer-director Steve Oedekerk has taken an old Japanese kung fu movie, and using digital wizardry has placed himself in it and added new footage to come up with a movie that is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Just when you think the movie's overstayed it's welcome, Oedekerk pulls out another hilarious moment and you find yourself both impressed and entertained by his silliness. With none of the dialogue in synch with the character's mouths, it's just proof at how campy and bad these earlier Japanese movies were. Most hilarious are some of the noises that the characters make, especially Ling, the heroine. A sequel is coming out next year and I'm sure it'll be just as insanely hilarious. If you're in the mood for a silly silly movie, but one that is undeniably entertaining, KUNG POW should fit your bill."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"Ok, I'm a huge fan of Monty Python, Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the ""Naked Gun"" movies, so you can imagine how easily entertained I am. This movie is dumber than anything I've ever seen before. Yes, there are a couple of laughs in it, but they are few and far between (seen the trailer for this film? Then you've seen the laughs). The only funny part throughout the film is the fact that the bad guy insists on being called ""Betty"". Save your money and wait until this comes on late night cable and you left the remote on top of the tv while you're laying on the couch...that's the only reason I can think of to watch this waste of film."
1,The worst movie I've seen in a while....,"It was a bit funny in the beginning, the fight with the baby, the fight with the cow, and the use of gophers as weapons... all of those scenes will make you smile. It's also a very creative idea of how this movie is blended in with a few old Kung Fu flicks. But, after about 15, 20 minutes tops, all of the jokes get old, especially how all of the characters' mouths move after and before they're talking. Funny at first, it continues throughout the whole movie, and becomes very annoying. After some good jokes early on, it all just goes down hill, making you wish the movie was only a skit on Saturday Night Live. It had its moments, but in the end, it just isn't worth watching."
1,I really wanted to like this . . .,"... but it was just too stupid. Few things are more annoying than a great idea that's as poorly executed as this.I agree with the spotlight review that the best jokes were in the trailer. Yes, the digital work is quite well done, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the dialogue sounds like it was done by a class clown from the 3rd grade. Oedekerk had a great idea - he just should've had someone else write the screenplay. He has a good feel for sight gags and physical comedy, but he doesn't have the chops to make anything SOUND funny. A complete disappointment. Martial arts parodies abound, but a thoroughly successful one has yet to be made."
1,99% not funny,"Dont' buy or rent this movie. I can't think of a stupider movie which I've seen than Kung Pow. I would rather watch an hour and a half of the Golden Girls. I rented it after reading the good reviews on Amazon.com; these reviews were misleading. The voice-overs were occasionally funny, but they got stale and begged to be stopped. This movie is not funny to sensible adults, It wasn't even cheesey; Kung Pow was pitiful. Be warned."
1,Reviews by FreaK,"This movie doesn't even deserve a star. It deserves 0. It was so pointless...I fell asleep. About half the theater left in the middle of the movie (i'm serious) and my bro just rented it and could only stand to watch 15 minutes of it. You must be pretty messed up to give this movie 5 stars. I didn't smile once...it isn't my kinda humor. Sick, disgusting stuff isn't my kinda humor."
2,Knock off,The movie is hilarious but this is not in the case pictured and is only playable on my laptop. Chum!
3,Memento,This is just a bad movie that my siblings and I love to watch together. We watch it every few years.
4,Justice!!!,"Justice, indeed, for Kung Pow. The critics were horrendous when the movie came out in January. I'm gald to see its better graded here, because this is one heck of a funny movie, especially if you know a bit about kung fu action flics and are ""mentally askew"". I don't buy many DVD's (i currently have 3), but this one, i'll be sure to buy."
4,Funny,"I have read a few reviews about this film- most of which thought it was stupid and not that good. i thought it was hillarious and the stupidity of it made it that bit more funny. The way it was done was great, with the vioce over the old movie. My favourite character was Betty- he had the funniest voice and had some great lines. My favourite line is when the Chosen One says: ""I'm sure on some planet your technique is quite impressive, but your weakness is: This is Earth""There were many funny lines and i loved the Mushoofasa thing.This is a great movie for those who like a good parody."
5,THE KING OF CHEAP LAUGHS,"I am a lover of comedies with cheap, cheap laughs. I loved movies like scary movie 1 and 2. But this movie is the king of all cheap laughs, every thing from the intentional bad dubbing to the one titted chick.My fave line in the movie is ""WOW THATS ALOT OF PEANUTS!!""it isnt funy reading it, but trust me..."
4,"Some spoofs get it right, and this is one of them...","If you don't like this movie then simply turn it off, it's not your speed. If you're a fan of films like `Scary Movie' or better yet `Monty Python' then this is a movie for you. Dubbing himself into a 1976 Hong Kong film, Steve Oedekerk gives us one hilarious acid trip of a film complete with quirky dialog and hilarious special effects. Spoofing everything that makes classic Kung Fu films so funny in the first place and adding a touch of modern cinema like a Matrix fighting cow, `Kung Pow! Enter the Fist' delivers laugh after laugh after laugh. So little tonguey may be ridiculous, but renaming the villain Betty was a classic stroke of genius!"
4,"""STUPID-FUNNY!""","THIS MOVIE IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR EVERBODY!It is about as stupid as stupid can get, but very funny.If you like old kung-fu movies and ""stupid-funny"" type humor, you should pick up this movie. It's crazy!!!"
5,"I'm a man too, you know...I go pee-pee standing up!","To describe Steve Oedekerk as a brilliant comedic genius would be a gross understatement. This is without a doubt the most hilarious film I have seen in my entire life!! I could not sit through this movie without laughing out loud incessantly, so much so that I was bawling out in pain afterwards from the continuous laughter. Thank God for Steve Oedekerk.Enough said."
4,Double bill w/ Woody Allen's What's Up Tiger Lily..,"Stupid and funny. My 12 year old son and I (47) laughed alot and then I put on What's Up Tiger Lily.-A sort of original version of this type of film but with out much ""new"" footage. Both really funny. Woody has the better script but we laughed at both!"
5,What most people don't realize...,"This film was actually created using old footage from a previously unreleased chinese karate movie! The director (and star of the movie) Steve Oedekerk goofed with the original footage to create Kung Pow. Watch the film with this in mind and you can really appreciate the humor! The way he manipulated the original story and scenes into a slapstick comedy is either genius or insane...Either way, it works!"
4,What is it with discs anymore??,"When you look at reviews of DVDs have you noticed how many complaints there are about DVD quality? Half the DVDs I buy anymore are plagued with skipping and sticking. I have a brand new player and had to stop the disk take it out and clean it before it'd work correctly.The movie itself is very funny and the grandkids enjoyed it. If you like sick PG-13 humor, this is a good choice."
3,Great Movie but Amazon needs to update this listing!!,"Definitely a must see comedy movie if you like films such as team america, family guy, robot chicken, etc. I received the regular dvd of the movie while this is listed as The Chosen Edition. Not a big deal for me but just be aware that you may not get the chosen edition if you are trying to get that specific version"
5,Hilarious,This is very easily the funniest movie I have ever watched. My friends and I were laughing almost the whole time.
2,So Horrible it's actually kinda funny,"This movie is best enjoyed after a few Budweisers on a late saturday night when you have absolutely nothing better to do. It's dumb that it actually is too funny sometimes.In this Kung Fu movie spoof (it's actually played within an old movie) he fights amongst other things a cow and guy, done in Matrix Style.That tongue thing.... nasty."
5,Awesome video.,I love all kids of girls but I truely love this Chinese girls. How in the world do they get these ... girls. I laugh so hard when he said It Hurt ... Man. Aslo like when the evil man said I like girls. Who don't like them. I will get the DVD soon. I'll watch it until I can't take it anymore. When is the next movie showing? The cow was awesome but need more partice makes perfect. Thanks a lot. Mark Putnam
1,"DON""T BOTHER TO SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN",There is no reason to see this in a theater. If you do see this movie make sure you watch most of the credits - there are some good laughs in the making of and out takes. The out of sync audio goes a little far when the dog's bark is delayed nearly 2 seconds. While the Cow wushu and the baby wushu were entertaining most of the rest of the movie was disapointing
1,This was bad!,"This movies was so horrible! I cant believe I sat through the whole thing. I am a big fan of Steve O's thumb movies so I thought this movie would be great but it was just a big disappointment, the dubbing over the real voice just gets old, stupid and boring. Save your money and buy a thumb movie you will be glad you did!"
1,This movie has no point,"This movie is just not funny and stuff. For one thing, there is some lame kung-fu cow, supposed to make us laugh, I guess. Steve Oedekerk does NOT know how to act, nor does he know how to fight. I had to waste good money to go see this movie, which I thought would be cool. Well...it wasn't. Of all the movies I've seen that tried to be funny, this was one of the most miserable failures of any of them. This movie [stinks]!"
1,Supremely Awful,"This film was not even funny. Anything that you saw in previews or ads was the best parts of the film. Please, don't buy this film. It would only be advancing the cause of idiocy everywhere.If you have extra money to get rid of and can't think of anything else other than this film to buy, just throw the money away. That would be less of a disappointment.It needs negative stars, not one star..."
1,"No Game, Just Lame!","This movie was so lame. I recently picked up a dvd titled ""Kung Faux"", which ended up being one of the funniest things I have ever seen and is now one of my favorite dvds of all time, and then when I was telling someone about it, they asked me if it was called ""Kung Pow"" or ""Kung Faux"", which is when I found out about this dvd, so I thought I should check it out too. Man, what a waste of money. This movie has got no game and is content to serve up the same bad gags over and over again to fill up enough running time to be able to call itself a movie instead of the lame one note wonder gimmick worthy of only maybe a short web clip on a cornball website that it really is. If you want to see a truly hilarious dvd of dubbed kung fu flicks that you will want to watch over and over again, do yourself a favor and pick up a dvd titled ""Kung Faux"" and get lifted for life."
1,Tedious and Tiring,"This is first time I have written a review for the deliberate purpose of giving a movie a one-star rating. Normally, I simply forget about the movie and move on to the next one. But this one really irked me because I had expected it to be so much better. The ""dubbing"" grows tired very quickly as a gag, as do the repetitive fight scenes that employ the ""thousand meaningless blows"" kung fu fighting style. Some of the sight gags and dialogue are a bit amusing in the beginning, but I found myself waiting and waiting for the real humor to begin. This type of concept is more deserving of a 10-minute SNL skit than it is of a 90-minute movie. It's sort of like eating a bowl of pudding. If it's for desert, then it can be a joy. But if you're served it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, then it very rapidly becomes something you want to walk away from. Unfortunately, since I rented it, I can't 'walk away' from the money I wasted to rent it."
4,HILARIOUS!,"This movie is ridiculous. And SO funny! Basically Steve takes two old Kung Fu movies from the 70's, mixes them together, takes out the audio track, inserts himself and a few others via greenscreen, and then adds the audio with himself back in. With the delay and everything, haha! The storyline is absolutely absurd, and the computer animations and dummies horribly obvious, but it's all meant to be part of the fun! This is not a movie to be taken seriously. A classic for anyone who likes classic Kung Fu, or just silly, stupid movies in general! XD"
4,Holy cow! I mean... That hardly even seems possible!,"This has to be one of the strangest, funniest spoofs of martial arts I've ever seen. I watchedKung Fu Hustle, but really didn't find it especially funny. Kung Pow, on the other hand, had us laughing just about from beginning to end.The long and short of it, for people who don't know the schtick, is that the movie's creator basically found an old 1970's kung fu movie and either used green screen or reshot parts of the movie to put himself into the action. He also revoiced much of the dialogue to completely remake the movie into his own twisted vision of a kung fu spoof. The end result is occasional hilarity, occasional groans, a few slow moments but an overall great spoof.If you love kung fu movies, you'll probably appreciate this spoof of the 70's revenge genre. If you haven't watched any good martial arts movies, why are you watching this? Go rentCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,House of Flying Daggers,Hero,Iron MonkeyorThe Forbidden Kingdom."
4,"You're going to think you won't like it, but YOU WILL...","This movie was loaned to me, and the only reason I ever put it in the DVD player was so I could watch enough to return it. A martial arts movie spoof? No thanks. But I was completely in weeds on this one, and it stands now as one of my favorite goofy comedies. You don't have to have even seen a martial arts film or be into the numerous spoofs that are always being released. This movie is funny as a stand alone experience, and even the special features are a hoot. You won't think you want to see this, but if you like comedies in general you'll enjoy this wacky movie."
5,Steve does it again!,"This movie was stupid but still very funny. It includes, a woman with only one boob, a tounge with a face, numchucks made from gophers, an evil dude named Betty, a karate cow, french aliens, and a girl that sounds like a whale. They used footage from a 1970 Hong Kong flick called Tiger & Crane Fists but put Steve in it. It's a laugh-out loud karate flick! And if you like this one go see Kung Pow 2: Tounge of Fury!"
5,HILARIOUS!!,"I saw this movie in theatres & found it hilarious. As for those who didn't like it because it was stupid--well, it's SUPPOSED to be stupid! That was the whole point! Badly dubbed dialogue, Kung Fu fighters who didn't know how to fight, a one-breasted woman named ""Whoa"", & a bad guy named Master ""Betty"" Pain. You can't get any better than this! The humor was juvenile, but its perfect for those who love to make fun of all the Bruce Lee rip offs made during the 1970s. oo-WEEE-oo WEEE-oo WEEE-oo!!"
4,Kung pow: stupid but funny,"Yeah the story [was really bad], but if you ever pretended to be talking for someone and thought it was funny, or you like mystery science theater 3000 then this is hilarious."
4,tHiS mOvIe iS HILARIOUSLY FUNNY!,"At first, when my best friend and I saw the cover of this, we knew instantly we were going to rent it. We had no idea that we would laugh so HARD! It was a hilarious movie! It's pretty dumb, stupid, pointless, but that's what makes that movie so funny. It's this old japenese movie, only they add all this 'stuff', which makes it funny. Beware of all the funny surprises you definitly won't expect!!!"
4,"Great, funny, enjoyable movie, with an original theme.","Despite what others say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm a fan of the classics, and I own over 100 DVD's, done by the likes of kubrick, spielberg, etc. But I can still find enjoyment in silly comedies. There was really nothing bad about this flick at all. The jokes were funny, the dialogue was hilarious, and it was overall very enjoyable to watch. There were a few moments when I was insanely laughing (Like when the dog barked, and the sound of the barking came three seconds later). However, there were also moments I thought were a bit too cheesy or unfunny. For the most part, they were the cow-fighting scene and the whole Lion King parody. The graphics on the Lion King parody part were a bit too unrealistic to even be enjoyable. Despite small flaws, I would recommend this film to anyone who has a sense of humor and isn't anal about ""wasting 85 minutes of their lives"" on this film."
5,Great movie to make fun of its genre.,"I saw Kung Pow recently. I almost fell out of my seat on acount that I was laughing so hard. Each joke fell into place at the right time. I've heard that there might be a sequel. Some of the gags were new and some were recyled but overall it was great way to kill some time on a Saturday night. If you thought that the previews were funny, wait until you see it at the theater!"
3,"Two extremes, pointlessly stupid and hilariously funny","Ok when i first saw the trailer of this movie with this guy fighting the cow, i was sure this was going to be a bad movie. However the more you watch this nonsense, you begin to realize something....it is actually pretty funny! You have ""the chosen one"" with a magical tongue, a strange woman with one boob, and what i thought was the funniest part..... a villian who calls himself Betty! And also aliens are in this. What is great about this film is how it seeks to add humor to a serious martial arts flick, because we all know how serious they can be. I can't give this movie a great rating because some of the jokes are ridiculous as hell..... but if your looking for a movie tha is just for laughs, hey check it out. It is funny like Airplane funny or Kentucky Fried Movie funny, which is still very funny."
3,It has funny moments.,"Like it was said in many other reviews this movie belongs to the category of so-called 'stupid comedies'. If this was all it was I wouldn't give it more than one star (and it will still be probably too much - well, I don't like stupid movies). The movie has very funny moments (not so many though to really recommend it): its spoof of sillyness of Hong Kong movies of 70s that anybody who watched a few of those will definitely appreciate it, references to some of modern movies, etc. Overall, be prepared to sit through typical 'stupid comedy' with some gems here and there."
3,When the box office turns it's back for one moment...,"An absolute genius piece of work, for those who have mind numbingly sophomoric senses of humor. I did chuckle to a few scenes, for which I am thankful. Have laughed a least twice, it justified the $$$ rental and 60+ minutes of my time that I might spend staring at web pages.If your idea of entertainment is getting loaded, popping in a Kung Fu tape, turning the sound down and goofing on all the characters...then you're in for one hell of a ride bucko, as it seems the entire film is based on this premise.Should Mr. Oedekerk release anything in the future, I'll have to remember to keep my expectations low....then I might enjoy things more."
2,"Good ""B"" movie if you like Ed Wood","I saw ""KUNG POW: Enter The Fist"" last night. It's so bad it makes it as a good ""B"" movie. It is very predictable so go with no expectation, and you will find some good laughs. I caught the last show there were five people in the theater and we all had a good time. Also what helps is if you find a really good matinee in a tacky theater. I will add it to my collection when it's released on DVD. It's mindless fun.Mooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
3,"Simple, Fun & Entertaining","""Kung Pow - Enter the Fist"" is simply goofy fun. I'm not sure what the negative reviewers were expecting?Basically Steve Oedekerk spliced up, redubbed and added some new footage to an old kung fu flick to create a fun little comedy that will get you chuckling.Oedekerk stars as The Chosen One who sets out to avenge the murder of his family by the evil Master Pain, along the way he has to fight a cow, meets a one boobed mystic, and trains himself to fight in some unusual ways. Oh, and I forgot to mention that his tongue has a face?!Again, if you are looking for high comedy, this ain't it. But if you want a fun little movie that will get you chuckling, then give ""Kung Pow"" a try."
2,"a spoof of a spoof, and a bad one at that","This movie is not just a spoof of some old movie, it is a spoof of some old spoof. A few scenes were laughable, though most of them were thoroughly silly. Did you see the trailer for this movie? If so, you've seen it all.There is nothing more you need to see. I suggest you spend your time on something better."
5,WEEEEOOOOOWWEEEEEOOOOWEEEEEOOOO,OOHHHH EEEEE OOOOWWWEEEEEE OOOOWWWEEEEE WEEEEOOOOOOEEE OOOWWWW EEEE OOOOOHHH WEEEEEE OOOOHHHH OOOHHHHH WEEEEEEE OOOHHHHHHHH WEEEEEEEEE OHHHHHHHH WEEEEE OOHHHHHHHHH WEEEE OOHHHH :GRUNT:
5,Weeee-ooo-weee-ooo-weee-ooo!,"Oh boy, is this one goofy movie! It's a parody of poorly dubbed Hong Kong action films created by taking one of said films, the 1977 Jimmy Wang Yu movie Savage Killers, and sticking in a goofy white guy in a bad wig as the lead and some other new actors into it to interact with the original characters. The whole thing is dubbed, badly of course, with goofy voices saying ludicrous things. There's also a fair amount of goofy CGI, although I wasn't so into that. Anyone who's seen the movies this is ripping on will get a big kick out of this one, as will anyone who enjoys parodies in general.I saw it on DVD, and the extras were on par with the movie-unbridled silliness all the way. Probably my favorites among them were the two alternate soundtracks, one is what they were really saying before the dubbing, and the other is a books on tape style narration by a pompous British guy. Very funny."
4,See it twice before making any decision!,"This ridiculous movie had me laughing the first time I saw it, but seems to get a bit more laughs from me each time I see it. Take some old Kung Fu films and wipe the sound. Then redub the sound with some nonsense, inject yourself into the film and viola! --you have some hilarious results. You must watch this film without expecting primo acting and plot although my standards are such that I was able to see both shine through in this comedy. (I'm kidding). Just watch it. I can't even believe I am taking time out of my day to review this thing. Also if you can find the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" film which was the first film I saw to receive the ""Dub over treatment"", I recommend that highly. You might find it on the net as a bootleg and it will be called something like ""Night of the day of the dawn of the return of the bride of the deadly alien...etc"" It is similar to Kung Pow..."
4,They stole my idea!,"I actually came up with the idea of over-dubbing to create a movie like this two years ago. Oh well, Odekerk beat me to it.Anyway, this movie is very offbeat, so most will not appreciate it. I liken its creativity to the Mystery Science Theater series. Pick it up if your sense of humor tends to go against the grain.Have a great day!"
1,Humorless and painful to watch,"I now regret having wasted five dollars renting this movie. There are a couple of funny parts but most of the film is just plain irritating. It makes fun of every crummy kung-fu movie on earth with silly martial arts battles and terrible dialogue. Personally, I would rather watch the old kung-fu movies than this one. I was hoping for an Austin-Powers type of comedy. Instead it was rather like watching a bunch of home videos strung together."
1,Worst movie ever... uggggh!!!,"There was only a very few movies I wanted to walk out of and this is on top of the list. Sure its cool how they got an existing movie and threw in a few characters, but thats the best it gets! The voices get really old and stupid quickly. I laughed, then I... thats it. Funny for the first 5 mins."
5,You people are ignorant!,"You didn't get it. I mean you're watching a movie called Kung-Pow what did you expect? Of coarse it was stupid, it's a spoof! Morons!"
5,Great,This book shows Myron's advanced view on interactive art. Just essential for anyone interested in digital culture. Myron is a true great!
5,Interesting and unique,"This is an interesting book that helped me to understand why accounting and Wall Street have grown corrupt. Along with caveats, the author describes changes in accounting and finance that would help to improve the performance of the finance community in meeting investor's needs."
1,REALLY INFERIOR,"Respecfully I submit that this is the worst of the late Whimpering Heap.It should not have been released. Woody was struggling, but the big band era had already ended.Buy the Woody Herman Golden Greats instead."
3,WOODY HERMAN FEATURING BILL CHASE,"Classic jazz album from 1963 has the distinction of featuring the high wailing trumpeter Bill Chase, who went on to form the rock group, Chase in the 1970's, (""Get It On""), and who died tragically in a plane crash along with several members of his band in 1978. It includes a Chase composition, ""Camel Walk"", along with several, familiar modern jazz numbers. Pretty standard stuff with by-the-book interpretations."
1,Scan Soft PDF Converter 4 Professional is a nightmare.......,"(1) This software interfers with any direct download of a .pdf file from the internet. On some internet sites, the .pdf file may be copied to your desktop and opened. If the .pdf save option is not available on the website, the PDF converter software has to be removed and the windows re-booted before accessing the website .pdf files.(2) The PDF converter download wizard automatically sets their software as primary to open .pdf files.

1,Don't Waste Your Money On This Product,"I might as well have taken my money and flushed it down the toilet. This program works as good as garbage. Yes, it converts PDF files to Word Documents. Only problem is they don't look anything like the original. Then when I tried to open and print existing PDF files that I have saved, or that come in as faxes via efax, all it does is print a blank page. There is not one feature I tried or needed to use on this product that worked. It should be taken off the market. Am I angry? You bet I am!!!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I have used this product in the past, version 3 and purchased the upgrade thinking it would function a little better. When I constantly had issues with it not working and printing too many copies I contacted Nuance and found out from them they were aware of the problem, there is not a fix and they had no idea when there would be a fix! I would think next time it would serve the customers a little better to put a product out that works we kind of expect that when you spend a lot of money on a product."
2,Just Fair,"Product works on some of our machines and crashes others. Tech support was not good, with a Canadian who barely spoke English.We've made a company decision to move back to Adobe."
1,Think twice,You must be kidding $9+ to report a problem with their software???? I really must consider this 'scam' when dealing with my clients.Unable to register the ocx to allow simple viewing of pdf's on web pages. A simple task that has become a nitemare.
1,Very poor product and support.,"I ran this program with some success on Windows XP for two years. I say some, because at times it was slow and crashed often. I have also experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. Still I was able to finish the various tasks for which I used it. Recently, it stopped working altogether: it crashes before it can even open. Reinstalling the program has not fixed the problem. A ""fix"" recommended by the technical support staff for Nuance has been a waste of time. I do not recommend this product or the company."
2,dissapointed,"3.0 worked well, 4.0 has bugs and customer service for this product has not been helpful"
3,"Some good points, some bad.","I installed PDF Converter Pro 4 and was generally pleased with its performance enabling me to edit PDF documents. The big problem I have with it; however, is that in normal Internet browsing, when I click on a PDF document, more often than not, the document does not come up on the first try. It freezes my browser (Internet Explorer) and I have to go to Task Manager to shut it down. Repeated attempts at opening the document have to be made, but eventually the document opens. Because of that, I uninstalled PDF Converter. On the occasions that I will want to edit a PDF document, I will reinstall it, do what I want and uninstall it again. It is quick to install and uninstall, and since I don't do a lot of editing of PDF files, it will do what I want from it. As a previous review stated, tech support is very expensive; however, customer support is free and they are responsive."
1,Deserves a Negative Star - No Hyperlink Conversion,"I would rate this a minus 1 star but 'tis not allowed.1. PDF converter does NOT convert Word hyperlinks into the PDF file it creates2. There is no customer support available for simple questions, like ""why the heck aren't my hyper links converting?"". (Unless you want to pay $10).3. There is no meaningful content in their so called ""knowledge base"".4. There help documentation does not match the application. They instruct you to click on menu options, etc. that do not exist.I suspect they do not have a support forum, or decent knowledge base, or documentation, so that you are forced to subscribe to their expensive technical support plan.Stay away from this piece of junk."
1,ScanSoft PDF Converter Professional 4,"I deinstall the product after two weeks of use. It did not allow me to select Adobe Reader as my default program and was not able to open many PDF documents. If a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing. Also, the feature to allow editing of the documents in Word or Excel was most often non-functional."
1,Stay away if you use Office 2007 or Vista,"This has caused serious technical errors on my systems--all new laptops, desktops. It will cause MS Word 2007 to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system, possibly requiring you to re-install your Vista OS.Worked well in Windows XP and Office 2003 environment, and they claim this is Vista compatible, along with Paperport 11.The company will not offer me a refund. I will pursue."
1,There's a free alternative that's better,"I tried this product at work for a while. Fortunately I didn't have to pay for it. I found the open source PDFCreator to be superior. You can download PDFCreator for free from SourceForge. PDFCreator just installs like a printer, so you can create PDFs from any application that supports printing. I've never had a problem with it."
1,VERY ANGRY EX USER,"I bought this product in March 07. It loaded and worked great till 3 days ago. I woke up to find all my PDF's unusable. The program was unusable and just like others I quickly found that there was no way to get answers or a fix without spending money...19.95 or 9.95 to email tech support. The one free call got me a tech who had an accent so strong I could not understand him and when he couldn't fix my problem (after messing up my registry) he told me it was my spyware that was to blame...""disable your spyware and reinstall."" I tried ...no luck. Funny the parent company Zeon who is holding everything up, is offering an upgrade,hmm! more $$. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!! I wish somebody had warned me."
2,says it embeds fonts but doesn't,"I make books on Cafe Press and they require the document to be uploaded as a PDF, but must have all fonts imbedded. I've put three books into Scan Soft for PDF and the files work great - till I try and upload at CafePress which says the fonts aren't embedded. Reading and reading and reading on Soft Scan, since I can't find any support/help for it, it says all fonts ARE embedded BUT English Times. Well, I don't use English Times in my books for that very reason - yet the PDF does not show up as having embedded fonts. I can find no way to affect embedded fonts on Soft Scan. Every time I need a book PDF, Cafe Press has to make me a PDF that can be uploaded. Grrrr. (and soft scan is terribly slow)"
3,"OK. Note, version 5 comes in march 2008","Works OK. Some of the reviews compared to open source programs that are less expensive. Often they do not have an ""EDIT"" feature, not even for highlighting in yellow or making marginal comments. Note, version 5 ships in March 2008."
2,No compatibility with IE 7,"Freezes IE 7 and you have to close out and restart...besides that, the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the ""Print as Image"" selection for anything that is scanned. Overall it is OK, and with the vast price difference with Adobe, I can live with it. BUT, make no mistake, this program is far inferior to the Adobe products"
4,Finally Standing On Its Own,"With this volume, Zegapain finds some direction. With Kyo now given a strong sense of purpose, the story is starting to come together... albeit a little late. While the series is certain have lost at least a small percentage of its audience with the first two volumes, it will be interesting to see where the staff takes the series from here. With the enemy armed with a new weapon and the heroes on the defensive, what used to be a terribly below average mech series just redeemed itself just enough to get me excited about the second half."
3,Aromabar - Milk & Honey,"Seems like the Aromabar boys liked the vocals on their first album, 1!, that they decided to put them all over their second album. The music is very much like its title, smooth and sweet, but it's also much less differentiated -- the tracks blend together in a pleasurable flow. A few stand out, like ""Cupid & Orlando"" and ""Some Didn't Even Know My Name,"" but the majority of the songs put a smile on your face then fade from memory."
