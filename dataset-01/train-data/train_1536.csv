5,So easy to keep the microwave clean,Better than a wax paper covering ! Foods don't splatter or pop out from this cover. I pop it in the dishwasher on the top rack or hand wash. Love it !
2,"works, but poorly designed","How hard is it to design a microwave cover? Not that hard, I would imagine. Just design a round cover that fits over most plates and bowls. It seems pretty straight forward.Progressive manages to botch the job by making a grip that depresses into the top of the cover, rather than extending over the top. Because the cover is so shallow, this little depression dunks itself into the food about 80% of the time, sometimes smooshing the food and always making a mess to clean up afterwards.This cover gets the job done and saves me money on saran wrap, but I can't help but feel that the designers worked overtime to build a flaw into a fairly foolproof concept."
1,Too small,"Nice idea, but too small. Not wide enough for my regular dinner plates, and not tall enough for my salad or pasta bowls. As a result, they get almost no use. Two inches wider and taller and I'd be happy."
2,Not large enough,"This only barely didn't fit my dinner plates (which are 10.5"", fairly standard, I'd think), which was frustrating because it always had to sit on the plate crooked. Seems like they would make it large enough to cover a regular dinner plate. Other than that, it did the job well enough. I have a Sharp Warm and Toasty oven, and I accidentally toasted this cover instead of microwaved it, so it's toast. I'll be replacing it with a larger one that fits my plates."
4,Does What It Should,"Bought this for my mother and I have used it myself at her house. My mother seems to like it and she uses it all the time. It does what it should. It covers the plate, bowl or dish of food while you heat it up to prevent particles or liquid from spattering the inside of your microwave.It features a ring of ventilation holes around the top of it and a handle molded into the center of the top. It doesn't seem to get too hot to handle when you take it out, but I haven't used it that much and I haven't heated anything for very long periods of time with it.Possible cons:- It could be a bit taller and wider to better accommodate larger dishes.- The hard plastic construction could be thicker for extra durability.- Would be best if the plastic Contains No BPA and the company advertises that. (As it is, I am not sure if it does or doesn't, but most likely it does.)"
1,Flimsy cheap plastic,I was ordering a different product and I changed it last minute to order this. The quality is terrible. It is made of cheap plastic. It is very low in height. Much less than my previous one. It was described as 3 inches height which is not true. I can't send it back since it will cost me more money than to keep it.
2,Cheap plastic and goes out of shape,Though it does the job.It is made of cheap plastic and goes out of shape quickly and bends easilyIt does not sit on any dinner plate properly
5,I am happy,"Sturdy, works as advertised. Easy to wash. I didn't encounter any problem. Dishwasher safe.As i have to write 20 words so the main function is to protect microwave from splatter and warm food evenly which it does without any problems."
1,Steam burned a hole in it,"Worked fine for about 10-20 times in the microwave. However, after that the steam melted the plastic in the middle (where the recessed handle is), making the cover useless. It should have been made of a plastic thick/hardy enough to withstand steam..."
5,Love Only Sucks When You're Doing It Wrong.,"I pretty much only rate books I think are fabulous. This one is tops it in dating. For once, a real love book that stresses what men are thinking and feeling--instead of making everyone cardboard characters (All men cheat. All women nag). I absolutely adored this book and can't believe how well it hit the real relationship problems (and how to cope) head on, so perfectly explaining how to tackle the big ones and work them out. Bravo."
3,Love Tactics needs updated manuevers,"Love Tactics is written by two capable gentlemen for other gentlemen, but it seems to recommend planned artifice over honesty. If you are a guy in need of some carefully crafted dating strategies you should buy this book.The book is careful not to insert gender into the text, but it is so obviously written to men that women could use the book to decipher their boyfriend's every statement or action.Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate game playing when it comes to courtship.Finding Your Sweetie After 50"
2,"""OK""","Really learned nothing from this one, but better than some. Basic info that may be helpful to others, just not me. Way better books out there, but it's decent if someone needs very basic information... ""OK"""
3,Interesting Read,"This book had some pretty unorthodox ideas. I think that they will only work on someone to get pity from someone. One ""tactic"" is to be silent on a date that isn't going well. haha Then the girl might be like, ""Is everything okay?"" and spend a bit more time with him. Other ideas seem good, like having confidence. I prefer ""The Rules"", since it's hard to tell which ideas are for boys or girls. The Rules have helped me date a TON, so much that I'm taking a break (only 2/week). Good luck. This book is written by guys, so it might be more helpful to them? I'm not qualified to say."
2,Good try,"Yes,its a good try,but either I am too much of a connoisseur,or this book is really too simple.There were a lot of things,but I knew every one of them.And I dont consider myself really successful with women.I have read another book which is great,as a matter of fact I went online just to write a 5 star review for it.As a matter of courtesy, I will not tell you what it is here,but,to be fair to the readers I will tell you that the first name of the writer is Leil.You will also find my review there."
4,Simple stand to avoid messes,"When a larger table isn't available, this little stand works great. The design is simple and the funtion is useful. I've stacked 3 12"" ovens on this thing without any problem."
4,Just what I expected,This stand is perfect for getting the Dutch oven off the groung. It is compact and disassembles to make it easy to to pack.
3,I'm A Bit Disappointed...But It's Still L7....,"Well this album definitly wasn't as wonderful and fabulous as i expected it to be, being a huge L7 fan...there are just a lot of blah moments on this CD you could say. But it is not totally hopeless- for instance, ""Lackey"" is a great song (who wouldn't want their own manservant?) and ""Crackpot Baby"" has a great driving riff...but there is just not enough traditional L7 attitude in here to make me listen to the CD without skipping any songs."
2,Very awkward.,"I bought this for my mother, who is in her 80's and has knee problems. Unfortunately, it is too awkward to be of much use and overpriced for what it is. She can't use it on a sofa or recliner, where the real knee problems crop up. It's only functional on a hard chair. But getting up from a hard chair isn't the issue. It also slips around so it's hard to get it set just right. If you set the spring too low, it doesn't help you. But if you set it a tad too high, it will cause a loss of balance getting up (and may cause a fall)."
3,Nunn Bush shoes,"Shoes look really nice and seem well made. However, they are still extremely stiff two months later and are still very uncomfortable. I have to walk differently in order to avoid pain. Would probably buy something else next, which might be a long ways away, since shoes appear durable, too!"
4,Daughter of Joy,"Great story and plot, makes you think and philosophize. Well written and can't wait to read the other books in the series."
4,Daughter of Joy,"I'm looking forward to the next saga in this series, life & times were hard for women in those days & sometimes they still are today. It took great strong women whom I admire very much. You will be caught up in a real time saga & look forward to the next book in this series as I am. Gail"
4,Good story,"I dont read religious books in general but im a big fan of kathleen morgan. iv read a few of her other series, (i love her syfy) and this book compared to the others, is on the preachey side but the story is just as good as the others and it has a well thought out message"
1,Never received,"never shipped. Because I hVE BEEN quite ill, I have not paid attention when things I ordered were not received, unless this was a Kindle book. Please look into it."
4,Good but Predictable,"I really enjoyed this book, which I downloaded for free onto my Kindle. Definitely worth the read if you enjoy Christian turn-of-the-century writing. In my opinion the book was fairly predictable but lays a good foundation for the series."
5,Very well written; excellent story,"I loved this story. It was a classic not only because the story was set in the 19th century, but because of the story line. It was touching and inspiring but never boring. It is a great story that is based on having ""faith"". I can't wait to read the other books in the series."
4,daughter of joy-good read,The story in this book is very inspirational. It touched my heart and reminded me to do what is right in the sight of God.
5,DAUGHTER OF JOY,"Well written, difficult to put down, would make a great Hallmark movie. Each chapter leaves yo wanting to read more. A great parable for challenges of Christian living coupled with God's plans for each of us."
4,Daughter of Joy (Brides of Culdee Creek Book #1,A well written book. I am a Christian and appreciate the moral values versus worldly standard decisions that occured in many situations.
5,Great book!,Well written and engaging the whole book! I didn't want to put the book down! I am excited for the next book in the series!
4,Good book,God's ways are not always easy to understand until we can look back later in life and see how He worked everything out for the greater good. That builds faith and trust. Good book.
4,Cute,Good for a religious reader. It was surprising and sweet to read. I may not read it again but ...
4,Daughter of joy,thought it was a period story. And it was like It .I was like there the whole time. Better than a movie.
4,Daughter of joy,I enjoyed the book and will read more books by Kathleen Morgan. Brides of children creek may be my next one to read.
5,Daughter of joy,I loved every minute .MsMorgan is an awesome writer and really showed how inspirational she is in telling a story.
4,Not an Oke...,But I did enjoy the twists and turns in this novel. I never expected the obstacles boatload before our heroin. I was disturbed at the spelling errors throughout the digital copy...
3,Hmmmm!,"Read it, but it was slow in sections. Would not recommend it to my friends or family, but maybe to a young reader."
4,Okay,It was a interesting love story n God's passage for them to forgive. Dislike the repeating of thoughts of love
3,Review Daughter of Joy,"This was a random selection for my first book download, so not much thought put into it, I was very excited about purchasing my Kindle and wanted to fire it up straight away. It was OK but I was looking forward to a lot of better books but unfortunately my Kindle died and I had to return it for a refund. I tried to troubleshoot on line but this was most unhelpful so I had no option but to return it. Will I get a refund for the Elizabeth George book I puchased but will now not read?"
5,Lesson in making the best of life!,Abby came to Culdee Creek so broken and found her way back to love and so much more! The characters are worth getting to know.
4,Nice Book to curl up with,"This was a great book about love, life, and forgiveness. Although a little preachy at times, overall a very enjoyable read."
5,Daughter of joy,"I really enjoyed this book, a gave it 5star rating. It was so good I did not want to put it down."
5,Daughter of Joy,"This whole series is really good. The characters find themselves in very real situations where things are hard. While I enjoyed the entire series, I particularly like this first book. I love the story of Abby and Conor and I would reccommend this series to someone looking for a romance story that is grounded in the love of God."
4,Bride in waiting,Enjoyed this story very much. I thought the story was a little drawn out. It also needed to tell how Ella s birthing ended. I will pass this book on to a friend.
1,REALLY?,"I wish I had known that this was a proselytizing, religious book masquerading as a romance before I got involved with the main characters. A major waste of my time!"
3,Interesting read,"Interesting to read a romance story that uses the Bible as a guide. At crossroads in the story where it is so much easier to go the smooth path, we sometimes need to take a hard look and make a choice that doesn't seem to make sense. Reminds that we need faith in our life. Would recommend to those who are looking for a non-trashy romance!"
3,A SWEET READ,As a Christian it is always nice to read a book about faith.It was a nice read and I quite enjoyed it.
2,Very good,Beautiful!!! It brought focus to my walk with the Lord and when things seem still and silent God is still there loving and guiding me if I will trust and allow Him to guide my path. He is always art work in the lives of His children.
3,Enjoyable but preachy,"Typical love story --amid bible lessons. Well written, but a couple of historically inaccurate terms found. Refreshing to read a novel sans the vulgarity. I was also distracted by the numerous misspellings and punctuation errors, which suggests lack of good editing."
3,exhausting,Trials after trials for the two main people in this book .It shows d courage of one woman and the compromise of one man .god is in control
3,ok,this book was fine. the writing was pretty good. thought there was too much time spent on the beginning and then too many twists and turns in storyline thrown in towards end. storyline kind of dragged out.
4,Read in Two Days,I read this book in Two Days. At first I didn't think I would like it but it turned out to be a great book.
5,Daughter of joy,I was immediately drawn into this story and found it very difficult to put this book down. I loved the way Kathleen Morgan gave a glimpse of her characters and then began to peel back the layers of their personalities. I'm sure each person that reads this story will find their heart touched by one or more characters in this book. I also enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns in the story. I feel like I have just devoured a big meal and it was delicious.
5,Great insights,Scriptures quotes were insightful enhanced book.Great first book on kindle. Love that it was free. Can't wait for next one.
4,M. Skinner,I enjoyed this book. The story flowed well and it was clean. I will be looking for the other books in this series.
4,Daughter of Joy,I like to read about the more laid back and simple times of yesteryear. Daughter of Joy certainly personified that.
5,Classylady60,Daughter of Joy was a very romantic uplifting and spiritual read. The story reached readers to. Hold on to your beliefs and always trust God. Trusting him will always make everything come out for you great.
3,Daughter of joy,"I am little disappointed in the soap opera tells in this book. While the scriptures used were well chosen and developed, I thought too much context on sexual feelings was used."
3,"Nice story, but most people don't actually stutter that much.","I enjoyed this story well we enough,, but the thing that bothered me most was how all of the characters stuttered when they were nervous. It made the delivery much less believable to me. People can actually convey nervousness without stammering."
3,"Grieving, and essential aspects of self and humanity","It was a good story. But it was a little slow, and yet a little to wanting. I did appreiate the care she gave the young girl."
3,Highly recommend this book,This book kept me entertained from the first chapter. The more I read the harder it was to put it down. I enjoyed Abby's character. Even though she had tragedies in her past she didn't let them defeat her. She stood up for what she believed even though for a while it cost her happiness and joy. But in the end it paid off. This is truly a good inspirational book.
3,Good but wordy . . .,"Good story, but took entirely too long to get to the point. Too much analysis, story COULD have been told in half the time. Unexciting ending, nothing unexpected."
3,Medium,Nice writing by author and the story was nice just not my top favorite. A little to much religion based. Mom would enjoy.
2,Bleh,"This book was just boring, like so many other christian books I've read. I find it hard to believe that anyone actually thinks talks or acts like that. It's not believable. There wasn't much of a plot. I found myself skimming through quite a few times. I kept reading just because I don't like to leave a book unfinished. I'm not trying to slam christian books. I'm a christian and I would like to see more books out there that are actually fit for innocent eyes. This book was just bad writing."
1,couldn't get into it,"It was free, but it never caught my attention. I suspect it to have strong religious overtones which totally turns me off."
2,Review,It was a good story if you are looking for a religious romance. I won't be reading the rest of the series.
5,Sweet Book,I enjoyed reading Daughter of Joy. The book was sweet and had good life lessons. Im christian but it did get a little too religious for me at times. I sure i will read more books from Kathleen Morgan.
4,Clean but good reading,I enjoyed this book! The story line was like any other romantic novel but I appreciated this one because it was not steamy about sex. Any parent can read this in front of their teenager.
5,"Powerful story, rich characters!","This is book is excellent. The characters are complex and believable. The basic storyline may have been spun hundreds of times but this by far outshines all the ones I've read, and I've read a lot. When you get to a book like this you realize this is ""Fine dining""! Ms Morgan obviously incorporated and instilled her own suffering into a beautiful book."
4,A Nice Read,This story of a couple who had lost touch with God then found Him again through several trials and even separation was very uplifting and was written in such a way that the reader could apply some of the biblical passages to their own lives or situations. A story to make you think!
4,Daughter of Joy,"I liked that the story showed ""true"" life struggles of ""Faith"" of feeling doubts and questions to God when situations happen in our lives that hurt and disappoint us. As in ""real"" life, Abby took a step of ""Faith"" in taking one step, one day, into her obedience of God's will for her. She even became stronger and the woman she desired to be. First time reading Kathleen Morgan book and look forward to reading the rest of this series and more."
4,Sweet book.,"I haven't been able to read a lot lately, but it is very interesting. I can almost tell how it will end."
4,Daughter of Joy,"This is the first book by Kathleen Morgan I have ever read so I wasn't sure what to expect.Recently I have read several ""Christian"" books that I don't think deserve a Christian label. They throw in that the characters go to church a couple of times and I assume that is the ""Christian"" part.The set-backs in the relationship between the two main characters is not a new story line as, of course, there must be conflict to keep a story going. However, Ms. Morgan does give her characters depth and many of the readers will have faced similar real-life struggles.K. Morgan's book not only kept me interested in story line but had portions that I would label as inspirational. I have yet to read Book 2 but I am looking forward to Book 2 as well."
4,Daughter of Joy,"I enjoyed taking a step back into the 1800's for this tale of a woman searching for peace in her life. Her interaction with the rancher who hires her to school his daughter and take care of the house was absorbing.The writer's ability to walk us through this lady's day made me aware of what a long, tough day the women used to have...from before daylight until dark."
4,Great series!!!,I started reading the series with Daughter of Joy because it was free. That is how they suck you in...I read the rest of the series..loved the book..couldn't put it down.
4,Forgiveness,I always battle with anger and forgiveness and this story was a good lesson and reminder. God`s will is always the right way.
4,"Love is a powerful thing,",I really enjoyed reading this book. The writer did a wonderful job creating the characters. I liked that there was only one bad scene. Forgiveness is is a very loving thing if sins could never be forgiven we would be a very ugly place.I'll be reading more of her books!!!!!
5,Outstanding,Five stars all the way. Great book and some strong life lessons we all could stand to learn. Can't wait to get and read book 2Enjoy.
4,Daughter of Joy,It's a great story about getting through tough times and the importance of keeping your faith in God during these difficult times. It also is a great lesson on forgiveness. This would be an inspiring book for anyone to read.
4,Enjoyed,I love this time period and focus on christian morals. I admire Abby' s courage and faith in God. Her compassion for people who have made wrong choices is something we all should strive to do.
4,Daughter of joy,I thought the revealing of how important forgiveness is for healing our hearts and spirits was very well expressed in this love story. I really enjoyed it.
5,Great buy,"Purchased this kindle book for my mom; easy buy, delivery, set-up and readibility. Great buy, price, seller, overall good experience"
2,It was kind of...meh?,"The story line had me interested at first. As the story went on, however, I got lost in all of the predictable plot twists. The main character, Abby, was always so weepy and I had a hard time following her logic behind the decisions she made. I can say that it was written tastefully and an easy read."
3,Daughter of Joy,This book was amazing and i cant wait to read the rest of the collection and i know who ever else read this book you will love it :>
3,Too much religion,If you like constant reminders about faith it's fine but the charecters become annoying in their choices and their constant I can't do it's because of faith.
5,Daughter of joy,Daughter of joy very well enjoyed will try others in this range of books a fine series i surley hope the author contuniesher storyies of this book.
4,Daughter of Joy,I had never heard of either author or book but I enjoyed it and Jessie came through all her own troubles whilst helping others.
1,Didn't Like at all,"I read christian fiction all the time, but I hated this book! The main character knows not to be equally unyoked with her love interest, but it doesn't stop her from accepting his marriage proposal. I felt like while the main character had strong faith, the author was sending mixed messages."
2,Not a page turner.,"Nothing exciting to write home about in this book. The story has been done before so there was no suspense. In fact, throughout the book I kept getting the feeling I'd read this book before. I love books set in that time period though, so finished it even though I wanted to quit half way through. The characters were boring."
2,A lot too preachy!,"This book is is over the top preachy, I actually considered not finishing this book, and skip numerous long winded sermons. Will not be waiting for book two of the series."
3,Daughter of joy,"I enjoyed this book because it is a story about values and doing what is right. It is a story about strength.courage LOVE, obedience to our Lord and faith that he truly loves us. It is speckled with romance and an overall good"
3,Christian romance,"I chose rating this book a 3 because it was truly just ok. I liked the story - the characters were good and the trials that they were put through were huge. The part of the story I loved was watching the characters come to grips with what they had to do to forgive and leave behind the hurt and anger. However, it seemed like the story went on and on when it really didn't need to. It was a good story, but not one that I would rush out to read again."
3,"Slow start, unexpected twist, yet predictable","The start was painfully slow. By slow, I am referring to the number of pages it took to cover the first three days in the book. I started to think the book would only cover the span of a week. It was clear from the beginning that time was needed to deal with the pain in the lives of each character, yet time was crawling by at a snail's pace. Changes don't happen overnight, and the book needed to pick up the pace in order to keep my interest. I am not especially inspired to read another book in the series, yet I was intrigued enough to finish this book."
3,Enjoyable,This book takes you back to a time that is long gone. I have read better books and also worse books.
4,Good read,Good story line about forgiving others and listening for God's plans for your life instead of doing things your way.
4,Inspirational,A beautifully written love story that deeply probes using Christian values to make the hard decisions in relationships. Told with love and gentleness by an author who has lived with and carried her own personal crosses with grace and faith.
3,Daughter of joy,Enjoyed the setting of the book--western time frame. The religious reference became a little tedious by the end of the book.
3,My thoughts on the book,This was a good book and so filled with God's presence. It was a JOY to read. It kept my interest to the end.
5,Excellent book !,"This is book is excellent. I've read, and I've read a lot. When you get to a book like this you realize this is ""Fine dining""! It's a wonderful book."
5,Loved it!,"So many times in Christan Fiction a story line can be so predictable, but not this book! The author kept me gasping and enjoying every twist and turn. And the underlying story of forgiveness and healing is beautiful. I'm so glad I discovered Kathleen Morgan and this series!"
4,Good read,I enjoyed reading this book. My only problem was the last part where you had to read what happened next through her letter. It would have been nice if you had experienced their reconciliation before the end. It felt a bit rushed.
4,Enjoyed the book but abrupt ending,"I really enjoyed this book and all of the characters and the story. However, I was disappointed in the abrupt ending. When the characters finally find their way back to each other the story just ends with an epilogue. It really needed another chapter to talk about how they get back together and then, of course, their wedding. I'm hoping that if I read more of her books that they don't have similar endings. When you spend so much time getting to know the characters in a story, their feelings, struggles, etc. you want closure at the end."
5,Culdee Creek series,"I love the Culdee Creek series, I am trying to learn how to walk as a woman of God and these books set awesome examples...impressed and really enjoy!! Wish I could be as the women in these books!!!"
4,A light story about restoration,"As with any of Kathleen Morgan's books, I expect an enjoyable story more than some great work of fiction. As a result this book was exactly what I expected - A heart-warming story with characters you connect with and get to watch grow and develop. :)I agree with some reviewers that the Christian elements read more like a sermon at some points, it was definitely done more heavy-handedly than the These Highland Hills series (which I enjoyed more). However it IS Christian fiction, so I didn't object to it since frankly I want those elements albeit prefer them done with a bit more finesse.The reason I gave the book 4 stars was that my heart simply didn't connect with it as strongly as with the last two books of the Highland Hills series. All that to say I liked it and will undoubtedly read it again, but it's not in my top choice."
2,Subtle as a Neon Sign,"I don't think Kathleen Morgan gave her readers credit for much intelligence at all. We weren't allowed to draw any conclusions, but were beat over the head with everything. Including the heavy-handed religious messages. She even had to add an epilogue with the main character writing to a friend about how she had learned and changed over the course of the book. Uhh...we got it already. Several times.I agree with other reviewers that sometimes characters did things quite out of character. I cringed when (brave, strong, manly) Connor sent his farmhands into the burning building to rescue Abby's stuff, instead of going in himself. And poor Beth just disappeared from the story as soon as she abruptly stopped resisting Abbey.Many of the plot elements seemed contrived.And it was very preachy.The premise was interesting, and some of the scenes were quite good. I like the historical details.If you want more subtle Christian historical frontier reading, I'd recommend Janette Oke."
5,Loved this!,"I enjoyed this so much, I am now reading Book 2 and have purchased Book 3 also. I love anything that is Christian, romantic and set in Scotland!"
5,daughter of joy,Enjoyed the book very much and reading it was a pleasure. Kept your interest and there was anticipation as to what would happen next. Very different from other books regarding the amish.
2,Christian Romance,"It wasn't what I expected and was not well written. However, it was a happy, sweet story. Most of the book is about the happiness that comes from accepting God's will. I didn't realize it was a religious book when I picked it up."
2,Iffy,This book made me feel uncomfortable. The way the love was being described from a far (third person) made the whole interaction between Connor and Abby just awkward. I couldn't really get into it. It felt flat and redundant. The couple would make progress and then regress just as quickly when some unexpected thing was thrown at them. Easy read though. Not a favorite or a life changer to say the least.
4,Good readable story,"The storyline is nothing new: The two main characters being in love, the male difficult and inaccessable, countless ups and downs in the relationship and one misunderstanding every ten pages. The characters are however well presented and the authoring is stylish and enjoyable."
3,OK but a bit slow,"I liked the main character Abby, but found the read a bit too slow for my liking. The ending was a bit predictable, despite the twist of Sally's reappearance. The dilemmas were realistically described though. A quick read for someone."
5,Wonderful!,"I have never read a book by Kathleen before, I loved this book. I finished it in 4 hours then downloaded the other three.I loved the characters, who seemed so real. I'm giving this book to my pigheaded brother and hope it helps him."
4,Interesting,This book is breath catchingVery interestingYou can not stop reading itLoooovvvveeeeeeee itI recommend this book is great
5,Good,I really liked this book.It was hard to put it down once I started reading. I would recommend to others.
4,Inspiring,"This is a book about a woman who stands firm in her convictions, from start to finish. After losing her husband and son, she decides to become the woman her husband never allowed her to be, and she learns to open her heart again."
1,THE WORST BOOK TO EVER BE PUBLISHED IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY,"This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. The plot was disturbing and complicated. The book was worse than a never-ending Sunday sermon. This was just plain in-your-face proselytizing, the kind that makes your skin crawl because what is being said is, ""If you don't accept Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you will go straight down to the fiery pits of Hell.""I only really purchased it because the Kindle version is free. Is it any wonder it's free? It is a bunch of Christian Propaganda labeled as Historical-Fiction/Romance. Be warned readers, if you don't like Mormon's showing up on your doorstep and asking you if you have found Jesus Christ then you should not even remotely think of getting this book. Yes, even if it's free.People who rated this book more than one star, I wonder what they have been smoking, they probably shouldn't take it on a plane."
4,great read,I really enjoy christain romances and this wasnt any different. I would recommend this book to a friend if you like that kind of book
4,Daughter of Joy,I enjoyed reading this book although at times it did get slow!! I will read the next in the series if I can find it
3,Nobody is this nice ...,"While I do enjoy this particular genre of book, this one went a bit over the top. I've met some wonderful and forgiving people in my life, but nobody as 'nice' as our main character here ... nor will I. Christians are still human beings, with feelings. The forgiveness and 'turn the other cheek' formula can only go so far. At some point you simply become a doormat, and that's how I felt about her by the end of this story. It's not a bad book, but a little more reality and honest feeings would have been better."
3,"Good, but not great","This book had lots of potential, but about half way through I realized that I knew the entire plot. There was not a protagonist, unless you can consider circumstances protagonists. It just kind of fell flat for me. I did not feel it was preachy as some low raters felt at all."
4,Very good,I enjoyed the story very much. If u like this type of books I would recommend it as a good pick.
5,Great Style,"This book was a delightful read. Kathleen Morgan has excellent character development and creates endearing characters foibles and all. If I was Conner she(Abigal) would've tried my patience way past it's endurance but then again I'm not the man who desperately loves and desires her. She definitely fulfills her Christian duty, follows the Holy Spirit and is a healing balm to herself and those around her.The later chapters still held surprises and unpredictable twists and turns. I'm looking forward to continuing the series. If you read Christian romances I highly recommend it."
2,forced read,I thought I was getting along fairly well with this book until I realized I was only half way through it. I forced myself to finish it but towards the end I got the image of God hurling lightening bolts at the main character. It just got too heavy and depressing then throw in the first wife. I barely remember the end besides thinking the last minute conversion was fake. Normally I love just about every book I pick up but I am sorry to say this is not one of them.
4,"Powerful Read, I couldn't put it down","Set in 1890s Colorado, this is the first book in the Brides of Culdee Creek series. Abigail (Abby) Stanton has lost nearly everything important to her firt her husband and now more recently, her five-year-old son. Deciding she needs a place away from those memories she takes a job as a housekeeper for obstinate rancher Conor MacKay and as schoolteacher for his equally-as-difficult daughter, Beth. It's a good thing Abby hasn't lost her faith as she will need every ounce of it to deal with these two! I absolutely could not put this book down and can hardly wait to read book 2. Morgan is a gifted writer."
1,Tried to finish amd just couldn't,"it's been mentioned already but this story line is so predictable and boring. every possible scenario is introduced. too much ""flesh struggle"" going on. i want more to read than just the romance aspect of the story. i honestly just gave up trying to finish halfway through the book."
2,Not for me,Felt like something my grandmother would have read - and I am a grandmother - didn't excite or interest me and in fact I stopped reading it and deleted it. Safe but not stimulating story telling.
4,Good Book but a little preachy,"Very good book. An easy read. Good historical fiction. Good Christian book. I like Christian books, however it was a little to preachy for me ( thus a 4). Saying that, if you are picking up a book bcause you wanted the Christian read... lose your way from God, find your way to God, save those who have lost their way. put your faith in God with a historical fiction theme it is a 5."
4,Christian,I liked this book because it was based on Christian principals. It verifies how important forgiveness is. Also how much we need God in our life.
4,Aimee,"I enjoyed the story line in general. The author's prologue provided insight for the plot, but really had me thinking and questioning my own faith-or lack thereof."
4,Another story of redemption,"This book made for easy, enjoyable reading. It had some unexpected happenings that kept my interest. The Christian story was uplifting."
4,A very well written story with many twists and turns. Belief in flowing God's will is the main theme.,"This book was especially interesting to someone who is a Christian. The story illustrates how following the will of God is not easy , but the only way to be truly happy and content."
4,Daughter of joy,Wonderful. Easy reading. Good for reflecting. Just could not put it down. The ending is exactly what I hoped for.
3,Daughter of Joy book review,"Overall, the book was simple and entertaining. At times the author demonstrated good word-craft but frequently she labored to tell the story in a manner that was all too predictable. However, a casual reader would probably find Daughter of Joy to be a nice little read."
3,Ffor Women ONly,Book has a great start and middle. Ending semes contrived and rushed (Did all single women work in cribs in thoise years?)Finally disappointing
3,Historial Christian Fiction,I enjoyed reading this book. It is easy to follow and a good read for relaxing. Plot is fairly predictable.
3,An easy read,"A good story with lots of happiness and interaction.I usually read more intense books, so this book was a refreshing read."
3,An easy read,It was fine. Again a bit predictable . A bit too much sex detail in it for me. I actually found that a bit boring it went on so much.
3,Predictable,It was a cute love story but a hair too predictable for my taste. I appreciate it though and would recommend it to someone not as picky as me.
3,Okay,Okay a little long for me and dragged out. Found myself putting it down and forcing myself to finish it
3,"Good, but hasn't held my attention................","Good story, but hasn't really held my attention. I'm not quite finished yet, so it may surprise me yet... Only OK for me"
1,Too much God,I don't mind God being involved in books but this just went too far. The caracters all doing everything right and being perfect all the time annoyed me.
3,A very absorbing story.,I was hardly able to put the book down . good Christian reading. Thank you for good clean Christian theme.
3,Enjoyable romance,"This is a story of a young widow who, in attempt to move on with her life and escape her sorrow, takes a position as a housekeeper and teacher for a single father. The characters are pretty well-developed, but I did feel like the personalities were a bit exaggerated, and both main characters didn't really seem to have a definite personality. For example, the male character was bitter, hateful, and mean in the beginning, but by the end is very tender.. The female character was a bit preachy, but was often pretty hateful towards the male lead. It didn't seem that realistic. The plot is good, but some things were a bit disturbing, such as the visits to the brothel that seemed to be pretty normal for the men. Overall I would recommend this story for those who like an entertaining romance.This story is fine for teens."
4,Great Christian book,Love this genre on books and I can really loose myself in them. Kathleen Morgan has a brilliant way of writing about ordinary people and their lives froma christian perspective that is able to be appreciated by all
5,Very refreshing,It is so nice to enjoy a romance novel that is wholesome and uplifting. I could not put it down once I started reading.
3,Good but predictable story,I liked the story and it was easy reading. The plot was quite predictable but there were some surprises that kept it interesting and fun to read.
4,Good read,"A well written Christian. Book , nicely bringing in a story of life's decisions and love with forgiveness . A d God's mercy"
3,Food Stories,This is a fascinating collection of heartwarming Latin American stories. After each story is a recipe. They look delicious - I'll let you know when I've tested them!
2,What's up with pricing!!!,"I just purchased this set..which is great no complains, since I love this show. But I bought one month ago for $125, and now, only one month later its $87 !!!! What's going on with pricing up there..how much will it cost next month. Show's great, just feel I payed overprice and not even on Christmas rush!!"
2,"great show, bad seller",I would love the set as the office is a fave... the set I got used was in very poor condition and I question if the set is the original... would hesitate to ever buy used dvd's here again.
1,Buyer Beware - Not New As Advertised!!,"Just got this delivered today, and it appears that this is some sort of repackaging scam; where items returned to vendors are bundled up and sold as a ""collection"". All the seasons boxes were dirty and or smudged, including most of the DVDs. In one of them, the plastic DVD holder was completely detached from the cardboard, with the DVDs just floating about. I'm not even going to bother to play any of the DVDs. I payed for new, and that's what I expect. It seems I'm not the only one with this problem. Other reviewers have alluded the same. I've just sent an email to the vendor, so let's see how this is handled."
3,Mostly Satisfied,"I was upset that the discs were all supposed to be NEW, but 2 of the 4 discs in Season 2 were so scratched, I could not watch a whole episode on those discs. The other seasons were fine, I checked them all and there were no scratches. Overall, I am pleased, but Amazon really needs to check their products before shipping them out."
2,Probably should have just spent a little more.,"I ordered this with the impression that it was in good quality but when I received the discs a few of them were unplayable. The seller was quick to send me a replacement after I found the first disc that was unplayable especially when it you are watching one season after another, it takes awhile. It was just too much hassle to ask for replacements for every disc that wasn't working so I didn't contact the seller about it. So the condition the claimed was a little deceiving. Some times it is worth a little extra to get what you want. I will say that the seller was very pleasant and easy to work with."
2,Not new.,"I did read the reviews, so was taking a chance on great price for a used product that is advertised as ""NEW"". All were not damaged when I watched, but looked it in the re-packaging."
2,Deep scratches,Three discs had very deep scratches. This made the discs skip or time out. Very frustrating! Will never buy from this seller again!
3,Love the show,I didnt by this box set from Amazon or any store instead i was at a pawn shop and bought it for only $40 which was way cheaper then what amazon had it for. Now i started watching it (I love the show) season 1 and season 2 nothing was wrong with them they played all the way through the disc were not ruined. How ever i looked at the other season and season 3 and 5 are missing the plastic case that season 2 had that holds the dvds. Insted they have the dvds in a plastic back on on a foam circle which is glued to the cover. Now im scared that the dvd in season 3 and 5 are ruined. I am just about getting ready to start season 3 so i will see of those dvd plays in the mean time i have to get a cd case to hold the cds from season 3 and 5.If your going to buy this see if you can buy it at a regular story
2,Far better than others in the series (but still bad),"When I first started watching this, I assumed it was a later version of the show because I enjoyed it so much more than the others I have watched. I was surprised to see that it actually is copyrighted a year earlier, so it must represent the quality work that gave the producers the license to turn out the later schlock. Not that this is of high quality; the cartoons are still incomprehensible, and the Henry character is still annoying rather than hilarious. But the nature segments were longer, more educational, and also of a high quality, although the subject of insects may have had something to do with it. The storyline between Henry and the narrator is diminished, and rightfully so. This is still far from a quality show though, with lame jokes and an insensitivity to footage that might be scary to toddlers (such as a seemingly giant tarantula squeezing into Henry's house, with the explanation that mini beasts love to live in our homes)."
3,Not as good as other Moon handbooks.,"This is an OK all-around guidebook on New Mexico, its geography, and some of its history. Thank goodness, Moon wised up and included a full-color map of the state in the latest edition. However, the information for an area which I know quite well, Carlsbad, is poor--did the author actually check out his recommendations? For example: he recommends you stay (and eat) at White's City outside of town (a local laughingstock in some quarters); he makes no mention of the Stevens Motel, which is the most popular hotel and all-around restaurant (where even locals enjoy Sunday dinner); and no mention is made of some of the best day-trips. Inexplicably, the author felt compelled to quote some of the Santa Fe's nuclear-storage political views _twice_ in the course of the book. Contrast this with Don Pitcher's flawless Moon handbook for Wyoming."
4,Good for small children,Legends of the Bible is a good series. Will work as an addition to Bible story time ina children's church or VBS setting.
4,Well done.,"Although my 5 year old grandson was impatient for Charleton Heston's recap of the story to be over (which I enjoyed), once the cartoon portion began, he was enthralled. Good animation and a story well told. Could have done without the hokey song about dreams, which was repeated throughout."
5,Great Christmas Present,"Using this video as a Christmas present for the kids. Although I haven't seen this video yet, I'm sure it will be a great addition to the other videos that we already own from this series."
1,THIS IS NOT THE PLAY,"This page describes the NOVEL by Clarence Day written in 1920, not the PLAY by Lindsay & Crouse written in 1948. The ISBN is for the play but Amazon does not recognize that these are two completely different works and what is described here and what you get if you order is Clarence day's NOVEL (not written or collaborated by Lindsay & Crouse). Barnes & Noble has the PLAY by Lindsay & Crouse, correctly listed as a distinct work from the novel written by a different author 28 years earlier."
3,Eh,I started reading this play to see if I would like to direct it at my nearby community theater. It just didn't grab me. Perhaps in the right hands it could be quite entertaining - I just couldn't see myself bringing these characters to life.
4,Good GPS system but some slight issues,I purchased this about 6 months ago. I have had mixed feelings about it. When it works it's great (which is most of the time). Others when it fails to function is most always around loosing GPS connections. The software has improved drastically. When I purchased it initially it came with the old software which has the same version # as the new software so it was a bit confusing. If you purchase this unit verify that you do have the latest version of software. It's maps are more up to date and you can tilt the viewing angle of the map. But it hangs more often than the previous version.
5,A GPS for driving on and off the paved highway,"I use this item for rental cars without a GPS. I also use this item with my HP5555 with My Topo topographic maps when 4-wheeling in remote locations such as Utah where we have been as far as 70 miles from a paved road. The positioning is accurate but we do not use the voice commands with the street atlas. It is reliable and rugged. We take it on hikes with the topographic maps.One suggestion, use it with a CompactFlash card as the HP PDA's only read regular SD cards not the High Capacity type so you are limited to 2gb with an SD chip if you can't find the standard ""Low"" Capacity larger ones. The CompactFlash memory slides into the rear of the Navman. I use an 8gb CF card with all my maps for the USA and Canada loaded plus all the topo maps for Utah also loaded."
2,Routing issues with Navman,"I have the Navman 3450 for the IPAQ and I agree with the other reviewers who habed questioned the application's routing abilities.One major flaw I found is that the Navman mapping software has confused a major thoroughfare with the wrong US highway number. Since this thoroughfare MUST be taken in order to get to my neighborhood, anyone using Navman's routing would never get there.I also noticed that the Navman routing seems to avoid highways when they are both the fastest and shortest way to get there. I inputted a local airport as my destination from my point of departure, and Navman on either ""quickest"" or ""shortest"" settings, always maps through a maze of local streets, when anyone would know the quickest route is a particular local highway.I have used Hertz Neverlost GPS when I have rented cars, and I never had this problem with whatever mapping system they use."
1,Defective out of the box,"I just returned my Navman 3450 because it was defective out of the box. I strictly followed their instructions and sat happily outside for about 45 mins. as the Navman waited for GPS, which of course never happened. So I called Navman Support and they e-mailed a small program to me that was suppose to resolve the problem. Question number 1, why is there a separate fix program available - why not fix the problem within the installation software? Anyway...I installed the fix and received a communications error. After another call to Navman, they determine the unit was defective. Having it in my possession for all of 24 hours and the best Navman could offer was a RMA # and a promise to repair the defective unit. I thought they might just send me a new one while I shipped the defective one back to them. No such luck. So I don't trust Navman reliability, support, or service. I think I'll try the Garmin iQUE."
1,BAD BUY!,"Routing - very poor. It told me to get off a major toll road in the middle of my jouney. What because there was some dirt track which was shorter? Another thing it did was tell me to turn right, make a u-turn and turn right again instead of just continuing on the same road. That's just mad!No way points - It would make sense to plan a long journey in advance on a PC and put in a few way points. No chance with this Navman.Unstable software. - requires frequent rebooting.Destinations - Ahhh this makes me mad. I even struggled to find Miami International airport. If you don't know the zip code finding a street is very difficult and frustrating."
2,A Disappointment,"The sleeve looks great, the car holder is solid and well made, but when it comes to accurate directions . . . Navman is often WAY off. I live in Miami, where major road building stopped years ago. The mapping software is about 3 years behind! The software crashes often, requiring reset after reset. Also, the directions don't tell what side of the street the destination address is on! I'm switching to CoPilot. Although CoPilot doesn't have the awesome 3-D mapping that Navman does, I'd rather know where to look for an entrance and not have so many crashes (PocketPC crashes that is)."
4,GPS 3450,"I've been using this GPS about 1 week now, and I find that it works splendidly. I've been able to program it with different maps and it always get me to my location without trouble. The re-routing feature is very helpful whenever you wish to avoid traffic jams and deviate from the current GPS route.I gave it only 4 stars because it does not have the 3D map feature as the more expensive units have. All in all I find this to be a very good buy for the price."
1,BAD STUFF,"Arrived broken. Horrible suppport fomr Navman Co.The product often looses position, maps in my neighborhoob are off by more then 800ft.BAD BAD BAD STUFF."
1,My Navman GPS suddenly stop working,"Problem: I used to have this product for 4 years. Time to time, it requires to activate Software. Suddenly, software is no longer able to be activated. Navman Tech support said my software (SMART ST 1.90) is outdated and their servers do not recognize it. They said that I should purchase latest software in order to continue using this product. I do not understand why my GPS suddenly stops working until I buy new software. I am not downloading/adding any new feature from server.Conclusion: My Navman GPS is suddenly not working without any notice, and Nanvam company asks me to purchase upgrade software. And, even though I purchase upgrade software, I might use it only for a while."
2,It's OK given the relatively low price,Just got back from my vacation using the GPS. The software required reboot frequently. The map in some area are not accurate. The routing didn't give the fastest route sometimes. You need a real map as a backup in case the software fails on you - it happened to me on my return trip.
3,It's okay but I have nothing to compare.,When it works it is fabulous and accurate. It does take some time to warm up so be patient. I did not need the antenna on a 2000 BMW...and on a 2003. Navman tells you that in some cars (BMW being one) the windows do not allow good reception. Mine went fine. For some reason the first one stopped and I had to get a replacement. Navman USA was okay with the exchange and it went smoothly.I would recommend it because it has a good screen and is very much on target... it also corrects if you make the wrong turn.
1,Average product,"I decided to buy this Navman product despite reading many negative reviews about the product, because of two reasons. Firstly, this was the only product, I could use with my HP IPAQ and secondly because of the rebate that was promised while purchasing the product. I feel really cheated because I bought the product in March and the rebate form I printed after buying the product said it was good for February purchases only. The product itself is really average too, but I am more disappointed about not getting the rebate I thought I deserved."
4,Great accessory for the Ipaq,"Works quite well. Comes with a suction cup for your windshield, power cable to work with car lighter, map software. Easy to install. You can set up favorite destinations or go to the map, click on map and select any spot as destination. Can include or exclude restaurants, hotels, etc. Turn on/off the verbal instructions. Tracks dead-on on the map. Can scale map up or down for details or big picture of where you are going. Pretty fast, usually only has to think 5 to 10 seconds to figure out new route. Will auto reroute if you don't follow directions exactly. Only downside is that the screen is a little on the small side, and not quite bright enough in sunlight. Takes about 15-20 seconds to acquire satellite signals. Sometimes I have to soft reboot to get it to work. Better than buying a new car to get navigation."
1,"Navman Discontinues Smart ST Pro for iPAQ H5400, H3600, H3700 & H3800",Just got off the phone with Navman support. They asked me to buy a latest iPaq and buy new Navman. Since they stopped supporting the old and the old one does not seem to work with their server for registering the software.
4,For the money--this thing is fantastic.,"I wanted a GPS for occasional trips (especially when traveling in new cities) but I didn't want to spend hundreds to get one. I was thrilled to stumble across this, which also offered the chance to get some use out of my dusty Ipaq 3670. As GPS's go, it's definitely at the low-end, but it works just fine. And for the money it's unbeatable. Even if you have to buy a used Ipaq off Ebay, it's still a great value. The suction-cup mount that comes with it is excellent, and the car charger works great. There are a few minor downsides: (a) It's running off however much RAM is in your Ipaq (mine is 64mb), so it starts a little slow. (b) It can hang if you try to move around menus while it's calculating a route. (c) You really need CF memory if you're going to load more than 1 state into it. 256mb will get you half of the US. All in all, an excellent value and a solid product."
4,Excellent Anime Drama,"This is a very engaging and accessible anime drama. The plot device is great: an ex-S.A.S. instructor and part time professor, Keaton travels the globe and gets involved in adventures while working as an investigator for LLoyds of London.No giant robots or super-powered martial artists are in this series but there is alot of realistic action. The animation is not ""Macross Plus"" or ""Spirited Away"" quality but it is very good.Keaton's understated character should appeal to anime fans and will probably create some new ones."
5,This is an ABRIDGED VERSION,"My nine-year-old daughter loves this book, but I just want people to be aware that this book is a ""specially adapted version by Lucia Monfried."" It has 238 pages of fairly large type with illustrations added. I just saw that another version of the book (most likely the original) has 464 pages! Just wanted you to be aware and purchase the book that's right for you."
5,Great !,"It is a really expressive Cd... The popsongs are quite good,Brilliant lyrics, but the instrumental track ""Music from the Balcony"" is just really weird and wonderful.......and It makes this work complete as an whole."
3,The worst album of the best musician,"Mike was about to leave Virgin where hed had stopped being free to create his music. They only wanted him to make pop hits and this record is as a whole a big parody of all that. The title of the tracks says everything about it knowing it was the last record of the deal. He must have had a lot of fun making it, and the long instrumental 'Music From the Balcony' is as chaotic and loose it can be, which had to be really liberating and therapeutic for him. Although the quality of the album is very affected by all the tiredness Mike had at the time, I love 'Music from the Balcony' and 'Heaven's Open' reminds one of his best vocal songs to the date. Another interesting thing is Mike's the lead singer for the 5 vocal tracks for the only time. A funny album to listen, and with a very clear concept: the liberation from the meanness and materialism of this world."
2,1907 adventure,"The Austrian Archduke Karl is dead. His eldest son and heir, Frederick Augustus, is also presumed dead. Or is he? A mysterious young man becomes involved with a dangerous cat and mouse game with powers behind the Austrian throne. Who is John Armitage? Is he the long-lost Frederick Augustus, or is he a notorious con man? Can American heiress Shirley Clairborne trust him? Will he break her heart, or worse, get her killed!"
4,If You liked Ralph's Party,"After reading Ralph's Party I came across this book. It's a love funny story between childhood friends.Both characters realize they are meant for each other at different stages of their lives. The descriptions and the things that the characters go through are very funny. After I finished reading, it left me with a good feeling. I recommend this book for those who are looking for something fun, light and with love in it."
4,Tracklisting,1. For Tomorrow (Original Single Mix)2. Science Fiction (Remember Of '89 Mix)3. Crescent (Moonlit Mix)4. For Tomorrow (Silent Poets Remix)Toy's Factory Japan 1994
3,It's ok....,Its just a shirt w/ a iron-on....sort of cheap looking... It's not worth the money... Should have cost like $7.
3,Inconsistent,"Moodorama recorded two albums in one; first, you have a great mix of good electronic vibes and new sounds, that put you on a tripy mood, then they experiment a lot with latin genres, which are good as well. But both just don't get along so well, so I would say that each part of the album is very good, but at the end you don't feel a message or a continuity to it."
2,A very light work out,"I agree with the review that only gave it one star. It is pretty light for a 25 minutes workout DVD. If you are new to Pilates, you should pick a real Pilates entry level DVD such as Pilates for Dummies. If you are not new to Pilates, you would find this DVD to be too easy and not a complete work out. I would recommend the videos made by Anna Caban (Pilates Intermediate Mat Workout). I give it two stars because I use this video as a supplement to my workout routines from time to time."
1,Don't Bother with This One,"It is less than a 25 minute ""workout"". Most of the routine consists of old standards from high school gym class, like bicycling and leg lifts. There is no incentive for me to do this workout again- the instructor's legs are not toned at all."
3,Uneven Recording,"Although the performance is good, the recording is lacking brilliance and a bit muddy sounding. (Although I really like Hyperion as a rule of thumb, I seem to run into this problem from time to time with their recordings) .Also, each piece sounds like it was recorded at a different location under differrent circumstances so that there is no real continuity throughout the CD. So if you don't listen to your discs straight through or you are not too much of an 'audiophile' then it shouldn't be a problem."
4,This is a pg13 movie,"This movie was not rated and while it's interesting, I was a bit surprised by some of the scenes in it.This is certainly not for kids, it's more pg 13 rated."
4,Great cheesy 80's flicks,I am a 'child of the 80's' so these two movies really take me back. These are nowhere near acadamy award winning movies but they are guilty pleasures. Uma Thurman makes her acting debut in Johnny Be Good. She has come a long way since then! Youngblood was the movie Patrick Swayze was in 1 year before his big breakout in Dirty Dancing.
1,Great Book Ruined by Publisher,"Across Mongolian Plains is one of the classic accounts of early 20th Century Hunting in Central Asia. It is also an excellent account of Mongolia prior to the Communist takeover in 1923. I can find no faults with the book as written by Andrews. However, my personal opinion of this edition is that it is not worth the money asked for it. It is a poorly made paperback, and the publisher has not reproduced any of the original photographs with the one exception being the frontis, which in my copy looks like a cheesy Xerox. This book is still available in the 1920's Blue Ribbon reprint, in hardback with photos for less than this ""new"" paperback. I am VERY dissapointed with this edition. Save your money and search out an original copy, you will find it far more satisfying. The first edition D. Appleton & Co. edition is still available as well."
5,"It must be good, because it taste bad","Don't like spinach? Well, it's good for ya! I just took my first pill and it tastes bad, but it is supposed to be good for you. I'll come back later to let you know if I feel it worked. The other type B-12 sublingual at 2mcg tastes ALOT better by a mile, but I made the swich due to reading more info on B-12 and figuring if I was going to take it, then I should be guaranteed by taking the right version."
1,Would not buy again,I didn't even finish taking these. I could not even tell a difference from when I wasn't taking them. I would not recommend them to you.
3,So far no difference,"I have a problem with feeling mentally sluggish all day. Concentrating only makes it worse. I call it having ""sawdust brain"".I was hoping these would help. Been using 2 a day. So far no difference at all. Also do not feel any additional energy. May help others. Nothing for me."
2,Haven't noticed any difference,"This product sure gets some raving reviews, so I guess it depends on your system. I'm 47, 5'7"", 168 lbs. I have been taking this for several months after trying the liquid version of a different brand. Personally I think the effects are largely psychological unless you have a poor diet and are not getting enough B12, then you may notice a difference."
5,A good supplement,I use this product in combination with other B vitamin supplements to help alleviate foot neuropathy associated with my type 2 diabetes. It appears to be working well.
4,Great value.,This is a great value. I am enjoying it. It's hard to find a b12 vitamin methylcobalamin and with 120 tablets for this price.
5,Methyl cobalamin B12,Wasn't sure about making this purchase but I'm glad I did. Can really tell a difference in this product with your typical b12 you buy in the stores. Energy level up and no longer in a funk.
5,"Great product, great price!",The product is great and is listed at a great price. We were looking for the 5000 mcg in sublingual form which is hard to find. My husband loves the cherry flavor!
1,Doesn't work -- Don't bother,My Canon S9000 printer uses BCI-6 ink cartridges. These cartridges do not snap in properly no matter how much youtry and cannot be used. They are not compatible with myprinter.
4,Cafe Brazil,"One of the better cds in the Cafe Roma series. The majority of the music and performers are Brazilian, not Italian. But the bossa-samba beat is great! The performances have crossed musical borders in a very pleasing way.The Italian numbers Senza Fine, Vorrei Che Fosse Amore and E La Chiamano Estate are super interpretations that add color to the palette. I like the two disc album very much as lounge music; not Italian Lounge music."
5,Very sensal film,"If you like story lines where girl meets guy, loses guy, then girl finds girl--this is the one. Very sensual film that makes me wish it was NC-17.... (Borat accent) ""Niiiiiiice"""
4,Well written book on knowledge creation,"Professor Barton has written an extremely readable book on a very imporotant topic, knowledge creation. Now a days, knowledge has become a buzz word in alomost every sphere of economic activities. But what does it mean? What does it take to create knowldege? This book addresses such questions. Barton has done important research on the subject and has produced the book with some new concepts that are extremely important in management. Her idea of ""core rigidity"" is indeed something every senior executive should think about."
1,High but dry,"This is a coffee-table book for climber wannabe's who might want to pretend they're going to climb some of the great ridges of the Himalaya. Most of the photos are pretty good, but the maps are sloppily drawn, and the writing style is about as bone dry as you can get--it's hard to make routes on the overwhelming ridges and cols of the high Himalayas look and sound dull [...]"
2,Ho-Hum,"Yet another coffee-table book on climbing the Himalayas, this time with a purported ""Alpine-Style"" aesthetic binding it all together. Unfortunately, many of the photos tend to be a bit amaturish, the writing uninteresting, which is saying alot given the fascinating subject matter the authors had to deal with. The gung-ho climbing aesthetic is also questionable, given the authors' own backgrounds. Plenty of other excellent coffee-table books have been written about climbing the pristine parts of the high Himalaya, in terms of photo quality and relevance, this one doesn't really compete."
4,This CD Has My All-Time Favorite,"I have had a cassette of this for over ten years. Track four, ""Bring a Torch, Jennette, Isabella,"" is my favorite Christmas song ever recorded, and we have about 100 Christmas CD's. I am going to by a CD copy of this in a few days. Check it out if you like comtemporary/smooth jazz."
2,Can barely hold Tilt,The bag is very small and can barely hold the tilt phone i have. The only good thing is you have some extra space to hold your cash and credit cards.
4,This album.....,"is my Saturday morning mood setter. I like to get up before sunrise, and put this album on to listen to while having coffee, and a smoke, watching the sunrise. The mood it conveys is of dark desolation, but not played at a slow pace. I always lose track of time while it is playing, and too soon, it is done playing. Despite being rather busy, it still manages to convey a depressive mood effectively, with the production."
2,"Lies, Lies, Lies!","Yeah, you might get a few rarities here. And it's neat to have a lot of these short tracks in one place. But the idea of chopping up Oldfield's long-form pieces, which on a collection calling itself ""The Complete Mike Oldfield"", should be treated as a criminal act! To comply with FTC Truth In Advertising laws, this should be retitled ""The Hacked-up Mike Oldfield, With Loads Missing That Should Be Here, But Which Isn't"". Not even useful as an introduction to Oldfield's work. Stick with the original releases, and come here only if you just HAVE to have those rare tracks. You'll be glad you did."
5,Este libro no es un MANUAL DE WINDOWS,O DE MICROSOFT.. Es un manual de carcajadas donde nos podemos ver retratados con nuestra ciber locura !
1,La peor compra que hice en mi vida !,"Esta lleno de imprecisiones, no aporta nada nuevo en los topicos que toca.Pareceria escrito por alguien que nunca tuvo acceso a datos actualizados y mucho menos que haya usado una computadora de manera profesional.La peor compra de mi vida..!"
5,Great bar for low sugar tast,I like this bar for the lack of a fake sugar tast I recomend it for anyone doing body for life or any high protien diet.
4,It's Away!!!,"Fans have long said there were 3 great writers of Star Wars: Zahn, Anderson & Stackpole. While I wasn't sure about the X-Wing books, I now have to concur with them.This was immediately an enjoyable book & if the others are as good I'll be happy for a few weeks. The action's as fast as the hot-shot pilots & the relationship between them is equally enjoyable. The characters fit right in the SW galaxy especially Corran Horn. If you're a Wedge fan this book's a must have.Stackpole's writing style is very readable, the chapter average about 10 pages each. You'll have 6 chapters read before you know it. The next 3 books are by him as well, almost guaranting more enjoyable reading."
5,']['his is a great book for Star Wars fans.,"This is a very good book. I think that anyone who likes Star Wars a lot should definetly read this book. It starts out anonymous, you don't know who anyone is, but eventually it gets easier to understand. This is kind of good, because then you can read any book in the series, but not neccesarily in order. The books explain what happened before (in the previous books) so it all makes sense. I highly recommend it."
4,Review,"Rogue Squadron is a fairly interesting book on Wedge Antilles forming an elite x- wing squadron. This squadron will help take over a secret planet that is heavily defended. It is basically a suicide mission. During this whole time the squadron must deal with having a traitor among them. Could it be Tycho Celchu, who escaped from Imperial captivity, or is it someone else..."
4,okay,"this book was okay, even though i sort of got sick of corran horn. what i didn't like was all the talk about the ships. i don't know what yaw or roll or pitch is....i can't even remember if portside is left or right (same goes for starboard). whistler reminded me of artoo in a way. overall; it was an okay read."
2,Waste of time,"As a long time sci fi and SW fan very disappointed in this book. Shallow characters, childish simplistic storyline and ineffective storytelling. I expected so much more.. time wasted on the read."
2,X-Wing Series,"This series takes a couple of things that work in the Star Wars movies and unsuccessfully converts them into a book. The dogfights are often long and drawn out, unfortunately, due to the innordinate amount of data that is required for the reader to be able to track just two ships in three dimensions often makes them seem slow. Also, for some reason the authors of the series find some inexplicable need to find a new way for every ship to blow up. The series also suffers because of too many characters. A squadron is made up of 12 pilots, plus support staff. Often many of these pilots never do anything but sit in the briefing room. Also, the handling characteristics of the different ships are often mismatched. This was particularly noticeable when an X-wing manages to outrace an A-wing. The Imperial commanders must never have graduated from flight school, and their tactics match such a profile. This series had a strong idea, but an incredibly poor execution."
3,Bre's,"I found this book just a little to sci-fi for my taste. I am a firm believer in that the clash of personalities makes a bigger noise than the clash of sabres. However, this book moved through the story nicely, and if some of the characters tend to get a little unrealistic at times I guess I can put up with that."
5,"Die Hard Star Fighting, with a few other elements,","X-wing is a wonderful idea, with very little flaws. I enjoyed it more than quite a few Star Wars novel"
5,Woah!,This book is a must read. The whole series is very interesting. The opining chapter does a wonder for creating the theme of the book. All in all I liked Wedge Antillies. I'm one of his fans and in this book (and the others in the series) no Imperial pilot can get near him without becomingfree-floating space junk. This book is one of the greatest. I'd recomend this book to one and all
5,In the tradition of Star Wars Dogfights,This book and the other three that I have read pointed out a lot of things I missed in the movies for example I completed didn't notice the A-wing that entered the seconded Death Star's exhaust port until I read that Tycho flew throught the Death Star to keep several Tie fighters and Tie Intercepters off of Wedge's and Lando's bask so they could destroy the Death Star. And the detail the Stackpole put in to the dogfights is the reason that I went out and bought Star Wars Rouge Sqaudren for Nintendo64. For those of you who watch Return of the Jedi just to see the Dogfights this is definetly the series of books for you.
4,a great start,"I was rather dubious about this series just because I figured it would be battle to battle with no plot or character development.I was wrong. Rogue Squadron is the worst of the series but only because it is the first book. Characters must be introduced and we have to get to know them. Wedge Antilles has always been one of my favorites. This book let me get to know him better and introduced to others who are know on my top ten list: Tycho, Gavin, Corran and my personal favorite from this book, Bror Jace. The people are so real and the comradeship is amazing. Stackpole is the best."
5,Thrilling,"This is an excellent book, combined with the usual magic Star Wars always contains. Michael stackpole is an superb author.The other 8 are also good."
4,a great book!,"I thought this was a great book exept small but important reasons like how the storys mostly about corran horn and wedge antilles and hardly has any of the other cooler charaters in it like nawara ven, and the space battles were so confusing I didn't know what was going on, and ysanne isard seemed like a really interesting charater but she was hardly in it. Other than those I thought this book was cool"
5,A fast pace book. Stackpole is the best author in the galexy,From the first page to the last there are no slow points in this book. The dogfights are easy to follow which has been a problem in many SW books. I just hope the rest in the series are this good.
3,Read it on the beach,There's not much thought provocation in this book but when has Star Wars ever been considered deep? It's fun and you can put it down and pick it up without forgetting what's going on. Don't expect a whole lot of witty dialogue or unseen plot twists. Just lasers blasting and bad guys gettin' what for!
5,"Exciting, and that's good enough for me","When dealing with Star Wars literature, you pretty much have to go into it knowing that it's not going to be made up of classic literature. It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be a fun, sci-fi romp through a galaxy that we have grown to enjoy. And this book is a perfect example of that. This book follows the exploits of Rogue Squadron a few years after the Battle of Endor.Unlike other star wars books, this one doesn't include any of the main characters. Wedge and Ackbar, being minor characters in the movies, are turned into main characters along with a host of new faces that are all enjoyable. Tycho, Corran, and Gavin are a few favorites.If you like Star Wars, and you like action oriented books, then this is for you. There is a little politics, but most of that is rushed through to make way for more starship battles. I'm looking forward to the rest in the series."
3,"Action packed, but confusing","I began to read the X-Wing series because I am a Star Wars nut, but most of the time I didn't understand what was going on. I didn't know what many of the words meant,(Like ""klicks""), but I'm glad I kept reading because the rest of the books are really good!"
2,Not consistent with the other three,"I really liked the last three books of the X-Wing series, which dealt with the overall destruction of Ysanne Isard, but the first book was really sort of detached from all that and dealt with a completely different thing."
5,A great book,From the beginning this book had me hooked. I found myself being drawn further and further into the life of Rogue Squadron.It was a welcome change that all the characters are new and that there was a lot more space combat. A great book and a must have for any Star Wars Fan
4,Star Wars,"This is an interesting series of books. Even though most of the time Luke, Leia, and Han are not a big part of the books. This series introduces a lot of new characters, including Corron Horn, who go on to become important to other Star Wars books."
3,Excellent Battle Scenes,"Stackpole deserves a great deal of credit for his writing of battle scenes. Not many readers think well in 3-space, and Stackpole has made complex space battles understandable to those of us who have never left the two-dimensional world of the surface. Ooryl and Corrin Horn are great characters, and the analysis of politics are helpful if not especially insightful.Thanks to the author! I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,One Of The Best Star Wars Books Ever!,"When I first saw this book I wasn't sure if I would like to read it. But I was wrong! Michael A. Stackpole did a great job with the details in this book. The best part about these books are that there are tons of dogfights.Wedge Antilles gets picked to be the commander of the revived X-Wing Rogue Squadron unit. He picks eleven hot-shot pilots to go on these near-suicidal missons. They asist on an assault on the Imperial stronghold of the Black Moon.They do this to get closer to the planet which is the center of the Empire,Coruscant."
5,EXCELLENT!,"OKAY, i agree with that guy from Los angeles. I saw this series a while back and i thought, ""ew that looks lame."" but recently i purchased the game X-Wing v.s. Tie fighter, (which is also EXCELLENT) and got interested in the concept of the book so i decieded to give it a shot. well, my review is EXCELLENT. i couldn't put it down. I am now currently reading the second of the series called ""Wedges gamble."" that is pretty good so far too."
5,Victory Again!!!,"Get all these seasons! What a freaking great show. I'm a girl and I love it. It really is more of a guys show, but I get it and appreciate it too. Ari is hysterical, and I just love me some Johnny Drama!"
4,The mysterious elephant,"I enjoyed this book. The author discusses his encounters with elephants over the course of his life in South Africa. Lurking beneath the surface is the possibility that the elephant's existence may go beyond the physical level. Elephants appear where they have not been seen for years. Lyall Watson encounters men whose life seems strangely connected on the spiritual level with the elephant.At times I was not sure whether Watson was sticking to non-fiction or whether maybe he was twisting the facts a little to make a better story. Perhaps, as is often the case, truth is stranger than fiction. Nevertheless, the case is made that elephants are sensitive, social, and mysterious beings who deserve a place to thrive on Earth."
5,Mix of mystical and factual thoughts on elephants,"Marvelously written with elements of mystery and science. This is well worth reading, along with To the Elephant Graveyard, which is somewhat similar."
4,good deal,The DVD's came fast. A nick jr. DVD was in with the 2 sesame street DVD's. No biggy...the kids love it all.
1,Soles SPLIT after a few uses,"I wrote the company after a second pair of their loafers soles SPLIT due to poor Chinese rubber. They IGNORED my emails [twice] at their website. I had bought one pair which split after about 20 uses and thought it was a fluke. I really found them very comfortable. So, I bought another pair which split about the same. I now use them for everyday use BUT I cannot go outside when it rains because water gets into them via the split soles. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. Don't buy them."
1,"a stiff, crude chinese shoe masquerading under an old American name.","The old saw ""You get what you pay for"" was never more true. I am wearing a pair of these shoes AS I TYPE THIS, and can tell you that you would do better to spend a bit more, and buy some better shoes.Update: These shoes made it all of 9 months before the uppers began separating from the soles. The shoes remained stiff, and really never did break in. Perhaps the shoes I received were the exception to the rule, but they have proven a very poor value for the money."
1,Oh Please!,I agree with Meray Wastwater's expert opinion. This stuff is just awfull and Coombs stinks.
4,Somewhat dull,"This is good for those who don't really know much about nutrition and want to start anew. For anyone else who's already learned the basics but wants extra information, see if this is at your local library first. I was disappointed."
1,"Information is outdated, therefore a danger to health","A lot of information in this book is more than 20 years behind the current research data in nutrition. For example, it advocates 30% fat diet, that level of fat is shown to be dangerous and cause diseases. For people who are interested in updated knowledge in maintaining health and reversing disease, please refer books ""Eat to Live"" by Dr. Fuhrman, ""China Study"" by Dr. Campbell, and books by Dr. McDougall, Dr. Ornish, etc."
1,left wing propoganda,"I'm watching this now on c-span and I am disapointed. This isnt about bringing us back to a constitutional republic. This isnt about representatives representing us. This is about getting liberals elected. This is a guy who wants ""honesty"" in politics. He basically wants Kerry to be president. All he talks about is the greatness of Dean, Kucinich, and other left wingers who didn't talk to us like children. The tone is all about conservatives bad/ liberals good. He is preaching to the choir with the audience. All they can say is: Haliburton, Iraq war bad, ect... This is dishonest he needs to be like that ""Whats the matter with kansas guy"" He needs to just say he believs conservatives are dumb hicks who are manipulated by Karl Rove. And liberals need to save the poor people who dont understand the process."
2,really weird,"this book was about this old guy named sadler and his life as a servant and all around nice but poor guy, and the very few people that actually came into his life. i gave it a chance because i loved Rose Tremain's Sacred COuntry, but this book was soooo different. it just kind of trudged on through, and i pitied the old guy but at the same time, i hated having to read about it. i felt like not a lot happened, and since i never cared about the characters to begin with, i didn't care about the story as a whole. i finished it because i'm one of those people who has to finish a story once it's started, but it was pretty dreary throughout the read."
3,Nice but...,"This is a well made cutting board, however the size is a issue.I wanted a small board for cutting fruit, however even that is achoir with this board. It end's up being a better hot pot holder, in theend."
2,Tiny!!!!!!!,"Now I know why the size was not listed anywhere in the item description. This is hilariously small - not sure what you could consider cutting on this board, maybe a tiny wheel of cheese :)It is beautiful though....."
3,Too small,"If you want a small board for an RV, boat or wet bar, this might be the one. It's too small for a kitchen."
3,great music bad presentation,"There is no doubt that the music in this so called boxed set is very good and for further info I humbly refer you to previous reviews. My disapointment comes in the destruction of the artist concept and display of the product. After reading the reviews I realized that most of you recall the album release, the albums came in a box format hence the title. But i do not know if the same people recall the original release of the cd which came in a clam shell box cleverly reproducing the album presentation. What is being past as a box is now a jewel case inside a flimsy slip cover the title should now be changed to Mike Oldfield jeweled cased."
2,Better bars out there,"I like Kashi but I was disappointed with these. These are more like cookie dough than cookies'n'creme. The nougat tastes like paste. Has more fat, sugar, and calories than other Kashi GoLean Roll bars. Get those -- they are a lot tastier!"
1,"Bland, dry, doesn't taste like chocolate at all","I love the Kashi brand, their cereals are awesome so I thought this would be good too. I was wrong, the bar is incredibly dry and the ""chocolate"" tastes well...not like chocolate, more like a cheap carob knock-off. The other reviewers mentioned the sweetness of this bar, I suppose there is some sweetness to it, but I'm the kind of person who goes for the corner pieces of cake for the extra buttercream icing so to me this wasn't very sweet at all. As for the ""cookies"", I couldn't get past the awful caroby coating to notice any cookie flavor.Bottom line, in my opinion, if you want something that is healthy, fills you up and flavor isn't all that important then this is a good choice. If you are looking for something healthy, tastes good and will satisfy a chocolate craving, eat a fudgesicle."
3,Not Your Standard Historical Fiction,"This is a strangely-told Civil War novel. It's the remembrance of Willis Carr, who was drawn into the war at 13 in the hills of East Tennessee. Many localities from that area are mentioned in the story. Sharpshooter is strange because it is told by the narrator many years after the war and he doesn't seem to remember actually being a part of the events. It's a good effort, but could have been even better. Madden's work is pretty well received by critics, probably because he does such a nice job of making ""history"" readable."
5,Rischard Simmons exercise tape,"This is a good exercise tape for older people or for people with any health problems, anyone can do this , & you get a good workout."
3,Nicely oversized pictures.,"This book isn't very thick, but it provides a good selection of many Art Deco images and products. I found it particularly useful when examining posters and artwork because the book is oversized, and this allowed the publisher to put in larger images."
4,Its a Bargain,"Not the complete Art Deco encyclopedia, this book is a great glimse of the American style. I found the right amount of narrative and photos and I for one appreciate that some are in black & white. If you are gaining an interest in Art Deco, this is a fine start. A good brief summary with a excellent price point.American Art Deco"
4,A Visual Feast,I enjoyed the book; the only reason that I didn't rate all five stars is that the book left me wanting more.
4,There are other limitations to worry about aside from PCI,"I rated it 4 stars because it does what it is supposed to do in windows. Also, a past reviewer was not entirely correct is his review... a PCI bus at 33MHz can transfer 133MBps (that's megabytes per second). To get Mbps (megabits per second) you multiply that by eight... giving you just over 1Gbps (gigabit, not gigabyte). This is a card designed to do just that.In real life, you won't get that much throughput, because of shared bus I/O and other limitations. On the flip side, most home systems won't require this much bandwidth, even for file copies. Most hard disks cannot transfer 1Gbps sustained, which is 125MBps...(megabytes), unless you have newer SATA drives on both ends, you might get close. In my experience with this card running in PCI mode, I can transfer as fast as my disk can output, including RAID striped disks."
4,Works Great With Newer 2009 Realtek Driver,I bought 9 of these cards at auction. All have been installed on XP machines. I only had one recent problem. My home XP computer could not log into my DGL-4100 router with the factory 2003 driver. I downloaded the latest driver and diagnostic utility from the Realtek website today and presto...I can now log into my router. Thanks to all previous posters. This issue has been nagging me for months.P.S. The new drivers say they support Win 2000 and Server 2003.http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid;=13&PFid;=4&Level;=5&Conn;=4&DownTypeID;=3&GetDown;=false&Downloads;=true
4,Problems with driver but able to download for other source,"I also got the Blue Screen crash with Win2K Server, but was able to find a newer driver from the link below. The newer driver (dated 2005Mar04 versus a 2003 version from Netgear's website) seems to have support for configuring the Jumbo Frame size from 3KB to 7KB. Unfortunately I got the NETGEAR GS608 8 port switch which does not support Jumbo Frames. Throughput is still less than 100Mbps with peaks at under 200Mbps. On big file transfers and Jumbo Frame the throughput should be better, although I can't test it out for now. The low performance is probably due to context switching for CPU between kernal and user mode and the none-zero copy of buffers. Hay, for the price of about $12 a NIC it beats a regular 10/100BaseTx card.http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloads1-3.aspx?software=True&refdesign;=True&spec;=True&other;=True&series;=2003072"
1,Doesn't come with low profile bracket for your Dell Optiplex,Enough said - Netgear can't add 5 cents to the their cost to provide a low profile bracket? Every other major 10/100/1000 brand includes it.
1,Does not work with Windows 2003 Server,"This product does not work with Windows 2003 Server, and it doesn't call that out on the box. This is 3 or 4 years after 2003's release and they need to indicate it on the box or customers like me will bring it home and it won't work."
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7,"The box says ""For Windows 7 updates visit [...]. But that web site doesn't have anything for the GA311. I searched online and found that some people were able to download Realtek drivers and get it to work. But that didn't work on Windows 7 either. After a couple of days, I gave up and returned the card. Maybe it could be made to work, but it isn't worth the hassle.Oh, and when it is installed, it prompts you every time you log in, to allow Netgear to make changes to your system. It didn't matter if I answered Yes or No, it still didn't work and I hate the prompts."
1,NetGear Support Zero,"Purchased two Net Gear GA311 1g network cards. One came in DOA. Called support, and support said they could not help me. The card is ""end of life, and therefore no support is available.""No support in spite of Net Gear upgrading the drivers for Win7 recently. If Net Gear can't support their products I will never buy Net Gear again."
5,A Classic for the Viennese Baker,"This is a rarity in terms of Austro-Hungarian cookery as it has a plethora of elegant, savoury recipes as well as an encyclopaedic chapter (actually huge) on Viennese tortes and other baked goods. If you want to master Viennese baking, my choices would be (in this order):THE ART OF VIENNESE COOKING by Marcia Colman MortonGourmet's Old Vienna Cookbook: A Viennese Memoir by Lillian Langseth-ChristensenKaffeehaus: Exquisite Desserts from the Classic Cafés of Vienna, Budapest, and Prague by Rick RodgersViennese Cooking by Olga HessThey are all priceless, and very worthwhile. If you must limit yourself to one, I reluctantly would recommend the Morton book over the others because it is the most 'foolproof', but if you know how to bake you should be comfortable using any of these."
4,Old Classic Austrian Cook Book,"This is an excellent book even though the recipes are done in such as way that already knowing how to cook will be helpful. There are a lot of recipes in this book. The book is lacking a bit in supplemental information. There are also very few pictures. Overall, given that there are not many good Austrian cook books around, this is a good one to have. It is very complete and has the names of the dishes in German. That is important, I think."
1,1 star is too many,"If you like ink leaking and decorating your printer and desktop, by all means, buy it!!!"
2,check this out in the store before you buy it here,"These really are super tiny. I think they would only be of use for campsite marking if you attached them to the top of your tent or the car antenna of a nearby vehicle. Of course, if you have something as big as a vehicle near your campsite, you probably don't need these.However, I could see them being useful in a group of people, if you were hiking late at night and without any headlamps. Attach one to the leader's backpack for ease of tracking them in the darkness."
1,Worthless... not worth the postage!,"I purchased this book for my wife and to supplement our other training books. One of the suggestions for handling a puppy that is ""mouthy"" or nipps or bites was to shout into its face.Absolutely Ridiculous!!!This may have worked once on the author's pup, but having grown up with herding and hunting dogs all of my life, I have never heard of such a thing... dogs aren't people, and one cannot anthropomorphise.This book was a waste of money!I'd recommend getting one of the other books like Cesar Milan's."
4,help! my dog has an attitude,"I thought the book would be for ideas on puppies , how to make them behave, i was disappointed with it."
4,"Fun, diverse, and completely worthy.","I might be biased since I received this for a gift, but I found this CD pretty damn cool. Unusual Ben Lee track and Julia Ferreira who I hadn't heard before. It's definitely a CD for people who like to be kept guessing ""what's next?""I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it, but worth a listen. Creative packaging [hey, I'm a designer]."
5,top quartet.,"I have known the guarneri quartet since 1969 !!! they wher and will be always my favorites.i know them all personaly,so my review cannot be subjective.Mr Steinhardt is a poet on the violin.Mr Tree in agreat musician violist,teacher and a friend. Daviv Soyer in one of the best cellists i ahve known,he understands as nobody else the function of a cello in a string quartet.Very deep and warm sound,present ALL the time,holds the sound of the entire quartet within the cello resonanse.MR J.Dally is the best supportive person in Chamber music i have known and when needed even as a 1st violinist of the quartet.long live the Guarneri Quartet !!!!"
2,not terribly useful,"I teach English as a Foreign language and I bought this book hoping it would provide me with a stimulating way to get younger students motivated. It isn't something I'd use.I'm mystified as to what the target audience age is for this book and it is fairly useless for learners who aren't conversant with English language culture references. Therefore, any humour misses its mark.This book may be helpful for teachers who teach native speaker children (very young because the jokes and characters are so lame they'd insult an older learner) the finer points of English but it's worthless for ESL or EFL teachers.Lastly, at just 64 pages the US$10.95 plus shipping cost just isn't worth it. If anyone would like to have my copy, email me and I'll send it to you for the cost of postage. I can't use it at all."
4,A fun read!,"John J. Gobbell's ""The Neptune Strategy"" is another great read that follows three previous books featuring war hero Todd Ingram. The action and suspense never stops. And the historical setting, in this case the Normandy landings and the Battle of the Philippine Sea, gives the reader a great history lesson. Compared to the previous books, ""The Neptune Strategy"" contains more international intrigue. I would not have thought that Gobbell would have ventured to Europe, but he does with a gold-hungry Nazi submariner who finds his way from the Pacific to the Atlantic. And Ingram is along for the ride! I hope that Gobbell has enough ideas for a final installment for the war's finale. In all, a really fun book to read!"
3,Partners in Crime,"This is entertaining, light fare. The two discs include: The Sunningdale Mystery, The Ambassador's Boots, The Man in the Mist, The Case of the Missing Lady, The Unbreakable Alibi, The Crackler."
4,Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime,"The quility and sound are first rate.. I bought these Videos, as I could no longer find them on cable. They must take place in the 1920's. Because of the style of clothing. Tuppence's hats are just too much....This is a light fun type of Mystery. Nothing to make you cry or bite your nails... About on the order of Hercule Poirot. For all of you who are fans of this type of Christie mystery,I recommended it.."
4,Tommy and Tuppence,"Clean, sophisticated British comedy. Set in the 1920's. Francesca Annis and James Warwick make a great team of private investigators. Based on stories by Agatha Christie, but without the convoluted plot twists."
3,bottom end of the Christie quality scale,"The married couple solve crimes by blundering onto the solutions. You should be able to get the solution to several of them within one minute of hearing the initial clues.Once that is understood, the acting and sets are first rate. If you are into cultural anthropology, you will like the series. If you are into crime detection, you will be disappointed."
1,Solaray Bio Zinc,"There is only 1 star checked, as this product was returned. I purchased it for my husband and it gave him an upset stomach. However, Solaray does have very good products, as there are others of this brand that I use. There is no fault here, to the product."
1,Just Say NO!,"This toy, and I use the term loosly, is a disappointment from start to finish. Not only is assembly conceived by a sadist on some really good drugs, but after 45 minutes of assembly which required four hands, it didn't work at all well. Sponges fall off, the elevator comes off its lift mechanism and gets stuck between floors, the sliding doors come off the hinges... In short, the assembly stage never stops. An easily frustrated child will become homicidal trying to play with this, an easygoing child will be bored within a short time. Either way, you're left with a giant heap of plastic you wish you'd never set eyes on."
5,Inspiring Interest in a Future Believer,"This DVD production of the David and Goliath story has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him. My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale. One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of David and Goliath. I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture. There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference. As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord and building a faith in the Lord."
4,Great for the kids-5,Another great video for teaching Bible stories to your kids and grandkids. I can highly recommend it to parents and grandparents for this reason.
3,a dissapointment,Sad to say this dvd covers only a small section of Anna Russel's talent the first section is sadly a let down there are far better showings of Anna's talent than the ones selected the second section in colour is slightly better at least one gets to see her humour this section is far too short again they could have chosen a better segment of her send ups eg the ring cycle the last section the interview is a saving factor with this dvd still one must be thankful that you have a record of Anna's amazing talent inspite of the let downs it is still worth having
5,"Excellent, easy to read, common sense approach","This book is an excellent book on the foaling proceedure and what you have to do, and know. What I most liked about it was its common sense approach and though the problems that the mare and foal can encounter were mentioned, advice was given on how to handle these problems. Some of the other foaling books on the market emphasis all the problems that can occur to the point that one feels that a mare should never be bred. This book is not at all like that."
3,Bronze medal,"Well if you are going for the gold medal for chair exercises then you will want to skip this video. Don't get me wrong - it is okay. I appreciate the good effort here especially with using various people in the video that have physical disabilities as well as those with weight issues. Of course Richard is encouraging and compassionate but the moves are a little too abrupt and there wasn't any introduction. It would have been helpful to demonstrate the moves or sequences prior to each section or more slowly. I was left with wishing ehat there were more songs on the tape as well. Again, it's ok. But for exercise videos, Jodi Stolove has the gold medal!"
5,It is a ball,Pretty much everythign I was going to say has been said already. I love the game and have spent hours playing it. Plan on playing for hours to come. As far as i cam concerned it is one of the best games I have ever played.
5,Contemporary classic 9.5 / 10,"This game is like Galaga meets Asteroids.For anyone who enjoys the classics this is a must have. The overall concept is simply an arcade classic space shooter.Advancement is purely how many geoms you collect, which can be earned by shooting them and achieving high scores.Despite it's simplicity the programming of this game is fairly deep. The intracacies of the design can not only be found in the cool visual effects of the background and sprites but also its strongest performance is in AI. The enemies all have different behaviours as well as your ""drone"" wich you can unlock up to 8 different behaviours for it as well. This is not a cheap knock-off game. This is one for the ages."
4,Asteroids on Speed,"Fun game, frenetic pace... not much replay value, though. Kinda gets tired, like the person playing."
4,I like it,Has helped very much with my job and when working from home am glad I made the purchase and will help with future employment.
3,Master of none,This is very much a book for beginners. What areas it does cover are only done on a superficial level. Anyone that has any formal training/education in technical writing will find very little in this book that is not either basic information or common sense. Important areas are covered in such a way that you know that you have to go elsewhere for the full story. There are too many better books out there.
4,"My first technical writing ""how-to"" manual","I took my first technical writing job in August, 1987 and I've been a technical writer ever since. I came across a copy of this book at a book store in Kansas City, Missouri, shortly after the book was first published. (The book store may have been a Barnes & Noble outlet.) I bought the book and read it through and through while we were on vacation in KC and I found the ""style"" information (Chapter 19) the most helpful. I purchased another copy of the book just a few weeks ago to refresh my memories and I find the content still useful primarily in renewing the fundamental concepts of the technical writing I want to accomplish in my daily work. I agree with other reviewers' stating the book is best suited for beginning tech writers while I add my own comment about refreshment of wonderful memories of projects past."
3,Killer price increase,"Naxos has always been known for its reasonable prices, but apparently no longer. This particular CD is a really nice offering, but the price has increased by $3.00! since last week. I suppose Naxos couldn't hold the line forever, but a 40% increase is just too much. From here on out, I'll buy 'em used."
1,"Good series - but REALLY BAD version of ""Adam and Eve""","Just about all of the editions in the ""Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible"" are excellent - good story telling and they at least attempt to stick to the Biblical script and scriptures - NOT ""The Garden of Eden"" - YHVH as the sun in the sky and the ""all seeing eye"" - and then a very silly, bizarre, and uncalled for section with Eve and the Serpent - not to mention the just plain disregard for the Bible. This is supposed to be ""safe"" for kids to watch. We just threw this one away - time to watch Joshua or Moses or Daniel or Sampson...but not this poorly executed edition.What were you guys thinking?"
1,Not what i thought it was...... AT ALL!!!!!,"I got the cartoon becouse the cover of the movie looked good and becouse Charlton Heston was on it. but the Video was far from the truth of what the bible says.... It is innacurate and can mislead children. i shut the video off and did not finish the cartoon. i am very dissapointed!!. the person i got the video from gave me good service and it was brand new and i recieved it very fast. thats the only thing good. Besides that. i was left with my mouth open the whole time in disbelief!!. Horrible whoever put this together.. i dont think they know the story of creation correctly at all!! as for charlton Heston, he was either tricked, or he is just strictly a good man and i give him credit as far as the movie TEN COMMANDMENTS goes. Thats all i have to say... But please, Avoid this movie for your childrens sake. Thank you"
1,Very Scary - Do not buy,"I was very, very disappointed in this video.Consider the following:1. It has God depicted as a triagle with an eye in it hovering and floating.2. It has fish coming out of the water, growing legs and turning into animals (this is certainly not biblical but the Evolution theory at its best)3. Adam and Eve are depicted as crazed in a dramatic storm in the middle of a lake up a tree.It's a shame that Charleston Heston's name is associated with this junk."
3,Boring and over-dramatized,We didn't finished this movie ... the splitting in bad and good ape groups with the dramatizeing music was getting on my nerves. Oscar started as a baby and was a young monkey in few minutes - for me it looks like he was changing age in different scences ... I have seen better and more thrilling documentations about Chimpanzees. You don't learn a lot about their social structure and about the characters. I couldn't bond with the characters. Making it between non-fiction and fiction didn't worked well.
5,Heartwarming,"This was really a great movie! I got it for my 6 year old (he loves nature documentary type movies) and we both loved it. It was a little sad, but it was really neat to see what happens and how Oscar perceivers. I would recommend this to anyone who likes nature movies. I've read reviews putting the narration down, but I honestly liked it."
2,Beautiful film ruined by the narration,"The filmmakers behind ""Chimpanzee"" should be pissed. Clearly, they love their subject matter and worked extremely hard to create this gorgeous film. When placed in Disney's hands, however, it became a caricature of a nature film. The poor music choices, awful writing and Tim Allen's hammy voice work really wrecked it for me and my family. I'm tempted to replace the film's audio track with some classical music to see if that solves it.What's good? The photography is fantastic. The film mixes incredibly intimate shots of the chimpanzees at work, play and war with stunning slow and fast shots of the surrounding nature. It's a visual treat at full 1080p on a big screen."
2,Should have just rented,"OK movie, way over-priced.....rental is better. Didn't like having to buy BOTH the DVD and Blu-Ray disc. Probably won't watch it twice."
3,not what i expected but cute and somewhat entertaining,"why i was happy to finish watching this film, I was disappointed with the middle to last part of the film, it fell apart and lost its focus."
5,Beautiful movie,"Amazing cinematography and nice music. Love seeing how they made the film, which they show during the credits. Captures chimp life so well."
5,Great product,Very good story that I am sure will be watched many times. Tim Allen does a great job as narrator.
2,Better in commercials,"Seemed like it was gonna be better in the commercials. Video and audio quality is great, but movie didn't keep my interest."
2,Boring,"Nothing you've not already seen in Discovery.The story about the little orphan chimpanzee not that original either.Save the 2 hours, go to the park or something."
3,Fasinating,"I wasn't as impressed with the story as I had expected to be. Photography was fantastic, good story line, but I was a bit disappointed overall."
2,Not as good as advertised.,"I was expecting moving and tear jerking, but was just sad and cutesie. Disappointed and wish I had not purchased."
2,Kind of dry and slow...,"This is a great story, and very moving. But it isn't nearly the movie I expected. It feels like Meerkat Manor more than a feature length movie production - with voices (unknown) letting us know what the various characters are thinking and feeling. And for younger children, it is definitely too slow-moving and dry to hold their attention. My five and three year olds will watch most movies all the way through - especially my five year-old who devours movies. But this just didn't hold their attention and barely held my attention. I was honestly disappointed."
2,Not enough cute baby chimpanzee,We rented this movie to watch a cute baby chimpanzee but instead watched a lot of adult chimpanzees with a small amount of baby chimpanzee footage.
2,Grainy and blocky,"The movie was good, its the video compression that stunk. Any time the screen moved the image was very blocky."
3,Some trouble viewing.,"The movie experienced a couple of interruptions during playback which was annoying. The movie was nicely done and the production really captured well, the chimps, in their natural habitat."
5,The way we were....and still are it seems,I was also reading a book on technology and human evolution at the time. The movie really helped me imagine our own history and the origins of our own culture that are readily evident when you observe nature. Technology may have changed us as we diverged from the common ancestor with chimps but you can still recognize our common heritage.
4,Great movie for me and the family!,Seriously....this movie was so great to watch with my kids. A great story about life and wilderness. And who doesn't like seeing chimpanzees in their natural habitats!!!
4,Chimpanzee,All I can say that it was brillant and the children loved it and I would recommend it to anybody
4,Great,The only problem I had with the film is it to short. I could have watched two more hours about this family. It's a great story.
3,Chimpanzee,I happen to like primates and viewed the film just because of my interest in primate interaction. For most adult audiences the film is a bit too ? childish perhaps. I enjoyed it and found the camera work to be outstanding.
3,not bad,Interesting and entertaining little flick. Tim Allen unfortunately ruined it for me. Otherwise I recommend for anyone who is a nature guru.
5,Just beautiful,"This movie was just plain wonderful. Sweet, funny, moving, and absolutely gorgeous. The amount of hard work and love put into this project is obvious. It's a little sad at one point, but if your kid was ok with Bambi, they'll be ok here. And the movie as a whole will be a great experience for both adults and kids alike. I was still smiling when I thought about it days later."
5,Chipanzee,"Clean, heart warming, and great footage. I also learned a lot about chimpanzee's that i didn't know before. Good for any age.."
5,Fun,My Grandchildren loved it and so did I. It was a great story with a wonderful ending.I recommend this video.
2,Slightly entertaining,"Educational, questionable. Entertaining, a little. I found it hard to believe this was not a documentary editted to look like a anthropomorphic story of the adoption of an orphan. The story was cute but more than likely the chimp would have ended up dead without its mother. I'd like to know what Dame Jane Goodell thinks about this movie."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I waited so long to receive this documentary, expecting something on par with the great animal documentaries shown on PBS. Not! I can't tell you how disappointed I was by this Disneynature Chimpanzee film. The narration by Tim Allen was dull and slow. His comments were stiff and overly-orchestrated. Not in sync with what we were seeing. The comments lacked substance and did not complement the scenes. As to the scenes: the majority of the shots taken of the Chimps were veiled by the trees and shadows of the forest. There were no sustained closeups of the Chimps' activities and daily lives. The camera seemed to jump around a lot. I would not recommend this film for purchase."
1,Not much for storyline,Story would better serve as a documentary on animal planet. Not much detail and a sudden ending. Glad I didn't pay a theater price to see it.
5,Great story,A beautiful story and footage. My 8 year old and I loved it! Its rare to find something to watch that isn't infiltrated with filth....even children's films are sometimes questionable. This move was a gem.
3,Good movie but nothing speical,"This movie would make a good TV special, but it's not good enough for a movie. It has very stunning senery. The primates were interesting, but the movie seemed really short."
4,Good for one viewing,"I don't think I would sit through the movie again but, excluding a couple occasions of slowness in the story, I did enjoy the film. Of note though, I am a fan of Animal Planet and other nature shows and that, obviously, affects my opinion."
3,Good for young kids,"Although I did enjoy it as I enjoy documentaries of that sort, it was kind of slow, but nothing wrong with that. It's just one of those movies/documentaries that you want to see at least once, but probably never again."
5,Awwww.....,"I love chimps so it was almost a given that I would love this movie. It isn't an in-your-face loud movie buta thoughtful, reflective portrayal of a chimps life. Sweet."
2,A patriotic and insightful view,"If you were only to read this book, you would get a very twisted view of the RAF bomber offensive against Germany. This book suggests that by the end of the war Bomber Command had perfected its techniques and were able to accurately bomb specific targets, in large part thanks to ground-terrain radar. The book goes so far as to claim that Bomber Command accuracy was greater than 8th Air Force's target accuracy.However, this book does succeed in demonstrating British Bomber's heroism (such as a crewman crawling out onto a wing during flight to put out an engine fire); and it also discusses the evolution of Bomber Command tactics and strategy.Martin Middlebrook's books, however, are collectively more detailed (Nuremberg Raid, Battle of Berlin, Battle of Hamburg, etc.) and much more insightful."
3,Nice Filler,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE Madness. Their music is smart, catchy, and fun to listen to. I'm also glad to have this collection. All the music sounds like it's been remastered, and the reproduced artwork is great for completing a collection of Madness paraphenalia.There are two problems that I have with this collection. First, it is INSANELY expensive for what you get. Second, for all the cost, you don't get any music that you can't get somewhere else (although you don't get the interviews bleeding over the music like you have in ""The Business"" collection). The only thing you're really paying for is the artwork.That having been said, I'm waiting for them to release Vol. 2 so I can finish my collection. It would be worth it if it cost about half of what Vol. 1 cost."
5,Four corners of the Night,"Compare this to what? Chagall dreaming at dusk near a pasture? . . . Kelly's poems paint their way into your mind through your eyes, in short, brush-saturated strokes of paint. Her short lines, full of amazing enjambments, lull you out of adulthood. But it's not all pleasant. There's a lot to be afraid of. But there's so much beauty (in all that mystery) after you catch your breath. Kelly's poem-paintings are dripping with nightmares and dreamlight."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Wonderful new album showing Bowie has not lost his touch!This may be a great year for music; next on my list is Peter Gabriel's ""UP"" album, which should be released around September, if all goes well...!"
3,This is not a 5 star album,"Well admittedly, expectations ran high after reading the positive previews of this album. But I'm not sure it's such a tremendous disc. I agree with a yahoo review that Bowie's voice sounds rather dry rather than dynamic.Should we be complaining about the lack of verve? To be quite frank, what I miss about Bowie is the range of his voice - which used to work better as an instrument. Older rockers tend to lay back though and I guess the Dame has reached that stage...to a degree. He's simply not as iconclastic as it used to be, and as the cover suggests. Fans expecting Heathen will find Brethren instead.The extra disc is nice to have. Panic in Detroit is a parting shot at what was. Fans of Outside will probably like this disc.But it's still kinda Bowie bland for me."
3,3.5 stars,"This CD is good, and a lot better than anything else he's done in the last 10-15 years or so, but he may never be able to surpass ""Scary Monsters"" or ""Let's dance"", or pick any of his early to mid 70s masterpieces. Having said that, he continues to be a giant in the world of pop culture, and always will be. It's interesting that he's hooked up with Moby on the current tour. I had someone who knows Moby tell me he thinks Bowie is kind of interesting, and wanted to know which album might be a good introduction. I didn't know what to say. I was just thinking the question was analagous to ""I like the ocean...where should I get in?"""
5,Reinvents himself every time!,"Excellent CD. Did not expect one out so soon since the previous release, I believe, less than a year ago! That means TOUR soon ~ This music is high quality... and modern pop. Bowie's still got it going on to be sure. An avid follower since 1974, this is one of his BEST newer type stuff since his radical departure when he did LOW, another excellent album. Enjoy... I'm buying it!"
5,cerca del espacio,"execelente disco para turistas espaciales, de seguro estuvo puesto en el cd player del endouver, cover de pixies, neil young y demas amigos...... bowie esta de vuelta en este planeta, bueno para flotar entre las estrellas."
3,Not all that,"Sorry, but this CD is a quite a letdown. Forget all that drivel about this CD being a ""return to form"". (his last two CDs were quite good, I thought)This CD certainly did nothing to put me in my mind of some of his older, better music. For one of the few times in his career, Bowie seems to be foundering- not knowing which direction to take. The songs are substandard for Bowie- none of them really stick in your brain. This being a Bowie album, it still gets 3 stars, but this one's got to go on the ""minus"" side of the ledger for Mr. Bowie along with ""Outside"", and ""Never Let Me Down"" (which let everyone down). Too bad."
4,The Thin White Duke,"David Bowie has made more great albums than almost everybody in Rock and Roll except for Bob Dylan. His music in the 90's has continued to be challenging even if it has not been very popular. Of all of the rock and roll stars of his generation, Bowie continues to challenge his audience and himself with various levels of success. Bowie's new CD is a very good record and at times has some great music on it. It is not Ziggy Stardust or Low, but it is worth having. 515 is perhaps the stand out track. With this new release, it seems that Bowie has finally mellowed his sound a little but that does not hurt the records strength. Perhaps Bowie will not make another record that is a classic like Ziggy Stardust or Low. Bowie is however still very capable of recording some very worth while music."
2,"Inexpensive, bright bulbs but poor quality","These bulbs are certainly a good deal and they do produce an adequate amount of light but they did not seat properly into the standard plastic instrument cluster mounts for my car. I inspected each one of the 10 bulbs and found that there was a wide variation in geometries of the mount interface area: not only were the metal conductor wires flimsy and out of place, but the glass itself in that area was not held to close tolerances. The end result was a blob of glass with two wires strung around it.While I was able to get 8 out of 10 lights to work after jamming them into each mount, I'm not certain they wont just pop themselves out while I'm driving. I will be looking elsewhere for 74 series bulbs in the future."
2,quite limited,"From the size of this book, I expected a great selection of names. But not even my becoming-very-trendy name was included. If your name is Jennifer or Michael, you might enjoy this book. But other people, even if you have a variation of a common spelling (such as Ysabel) will not."
3,I couldn't find my name in here!,"Okay, I couldn't find my name in here, and there wasn't any other alternatives. So, if your name is Miles - or something close to that, don't expect anything. The accuracy was disappointing for the most part. I have to believe that these profiles fit for a lot of people, but I would put a little caption at the bottom of the screen saying, ""for entertainment purposes only"" just for those with my such luck. It is a pretty fun entertainment idea if you know some people who aren't ADHD."
4,fascinating!,"i found the book to be really entertaining and informative because they were pretty accurate. to everyone i shared the book with, they are quite taken with their interpretation because they said the book really described them well. i really enjoyed the book because it's fun to read something about yourself and find that it's true!"
2,Hidden Truth,I was surprised at the condition of the book when it arrived - the edges were turned and the pages of the book were old and worn. I put the book to the side because I felt cheated. I am accustomed to much higher standards from AMAZON purchases.
4,Bomn it out,This book is terrific and has all sorts of great nthings about names and cool stuff to read qbout. Guess WHAT INSTEAD OF I TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS BOOK BUY AND READ IT YOURSELF BECAUSE IT'S MUCH BETTER TO FIND OUT ON YOUR OWN THAN RATHER SOMEONE ELSE TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS BOOK.
2,A little disappointed,"Received this anklet very quickly and liked how it looked but a few hrs after wearing it for the first time, the clasp came apart so i will need to use some pliers to open the ring and reattach it."
1,Yuck!,"Love malted flavor, do not like the Kashi GOLEAN bar. Not tasty and takes forever to chew one bite. Hard, hard, hard."
3,Great tasting protein bar,"The bar itself is pretty tasty. Some people may not like the soy chalky taste, however, I find this one better than the average protein bar. For those who lives in the hot climate, I would not recommand ordering this product during the summertime since it arrived half melted from Amazon. I live in AZ BTW. Overall, great tasting bar!"
2,Kashi Malt,Not a very strong malt taste like I was expecting. Overall taste is somewhat artificial. Very filling and easy to grab as a snack.
2,"Bland, very little flavor.","I bought these because I wanted an energy/meal bar that tasted good. I love malt flavor so I was really excited to try these. There's a very light hint of chocolate/malt flavor but if it wasn't written on the package, I wouldn't have thought it tasted like malt at all. Basically, if you really like malt, this doesn't taste like it. The only upside is that it's a little larger than most energy bars and it's filling but the taste is pretty bland. The search continues! I think I'm going to try a oat and fruit bar next."
2,Book should be renamed Java for C programmers,"This is an OK Java book for most cases. I think the author got lost in the world of updating a piece of work he has already spent countless hours in and just wanted to get this one more revision out the door. Oh, yes, this book will be completely useless to you if you are not a C programmer. I have programmed in MANY languages for the past 15 years, and I couldn't find another reference book that does so little referencing to the language itself and so much to how it compares to C. My verdict go with some other Java book if you are not a C guru."
3,Essential but flawed reference,"Java in a Nutshell is still a definitive reference, but it is seriously flawed by an inadequate index and the (apparently) accidental ommission of thumbtabs. The author, on page 272, suggests we ""use the tabs on the outside edge of the book"". There are no such tabs. Two stars.On the other hand, the book gains a star for its first 200+ pages, which serve as a concise and very accurate overview of Java."
2,hard to know who book is geared to,The textbook chapters appear geared to someone with no programming experience but who may have designed some web pages?So a mix of not enough explanation and examples and too much explanation. I'll keep for the references which will be useful when I am basically familiar enough with the packages to know what I am looking for.
2,Dang,"I think it's been said too many times already, but I found it unbelievable that the tabs and class diagrams were left out of this edition. As with all the other incredulous reviewers, there's little choice: it's the definitive quick reference, but what in the world were the people at O'Reilly (not) thinking when they made those changes?"
4,An amazing reference,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to try serious Java programming. All languages have a single de-facto reference and this is it. Loads of information on anything you would like to look up, although it is NOT a tutorial.The one problem I have is the lack of referencing for about 600 pages of the book, which is frustrating to say the least."
2,Ruined a great reference,"The java in a nutshell series was the most often used book in my arsenal off reference books. That was until now. Many of the most useful features of the previous three editions have been removed.First the ""tabs"" printed on the edge of the book which would help you quickly find a package are now gone... so now I have to flip through MANY pages just tho find tha package I want...From there I now have to find the class I am looking for, but the are not necessarily listed alphabetically anymore either. For example java.util.prefs.Preferences is on page 710, and java.util.Set on 677... ordered by package, leaving you with more to page through. Not exactly intuitive.And the package heirarchy diagrams are gone now as well.Its a reference book, but certinaly not a ""quick"" reference. I highly reccomend buying the third edition, but stay away from this one, at least untill they put the tabs back!"
2,Way too terse to be useful,This book is way too terse to be useful. Modern Java development tools will help you use the correct class method signatures anyway. Buy the posters instead and give yourself a visual overview instead.
1,clogged printer,"I discovered the Amazon Imaging ink constantly cloggs my Canon printer. When I first installed it, I experienced clogging, but Amazon stated this was a common installation problem and recommended cleaning the ink-head. After doing so, the problem was solved ... until the next day when my printer became clogged again. Too much hassle for the cheaper price"
3,Good.,"Good book for referencing and commentary on verses. He tends to go on and on about a verse. It would take you 5 years to read it all thru. He could tell you an hour long serman on one verse. But, you should get it just to see for your self or keep it in your library. It will look good in your libary."
5,Glad I got this,"I had been dragging my helmet along with my without a case and I'm so glad that I got this one as my first helmet bag. Its bright colors really stand out in a room full of show clothes, and and bags. I have been able to fit my spurs, hairnets, two pairs of gloves, a pen,and extra shoelaces all at the same time in the front zipper pocket. When I'm walking through the rain with it my helmet stays dry and the fleece on the inside is really nice. I would highly recommend this product. I also have the saddle cover and am going to get the garment bag and boot bag because I love their stuff so much."
5,An exquisite doll,"All I can say is this doll is exquisite! She's really too pretty to play with, but my daughter begged for her for Christmas so she got it to play with and not to sit in a box! You won't be disappointed with this lovely doll."
3,Kandoo wipes review,"I have tried several different wipes in the past few months since DD has potty trained and I find these....o.k. It's better than the generic store brands, but still not as thick as the Huggies version and I sometimes find myself using two wipes held together to get the job done. For the price, I think I would stick with the Huggies wipes and use less each time."
4,good quality,"very durable. the sneaker has different color cards to slide into the circle, nice added extra.my daughter loves this shoe- thanks"
3,General overview of the XK series,"This is a decent general referience to the Jaguar XK series, but does not go into much detail about the various models for the restorer. It does provide the development and race history and a summary of what to watch for if you are thinking of purchasing one, as do a number of other books on the XK series."
5,A rug that stays nice!,"I bought this for our guest bedroom that has a sleigh bed and mostly burgundy and beige colors. It matches beautifully and looks great.It looks exactly as you see it on the website. If you like braided rugs, you'll be very happy with this one."
1,Can't skip the beginning crap,"The DVD would not let us skip to the main menu or even fast forward through the ""ads"" at the beginning. Having to sit through several minutes of commercials with no way around it is enough to make me want to rip the darn thing and remove all the extras."
2,Not an accurate depiction,I ordered this for my kids thinking it would be nice for them to see the Miracles of Jesus visually. The graphics are poor quality and the message is not accurate. The disciple Peter is made out to be an angry person and they include things that are not stated in the Bible. I would not recommend this video.
4,Good little Kit,Could go camping a hundred times and not miss the kit but its nice to have. Heavy duty stakes are better then what came with my coleman tent which is good cause the NC mountains are a little rocky. Stake puller is similar to a paper clip and fairly useless. Mallet is better then I expected but isnt that solid and will eventually break. Would Def recommend the kit.
4,good tent camping companion,"This kit's mallet is heavy duty and much more useful and sturdy than those plastic mallets that come with the purchasing tents. The spike puller makes packing the tent a delight with ease; and the dust pan and little bloom are handy to sweep the tent interior and door mat. All in all, this kit is worth carrying along a tenting trip."
5,Great camping accessory,Definitely a great addition for camping. We use these stakes to hold down the corners of our Coleman Insta-tent when the ground is harder than normal. Whisk broom is great for sweeping up debris tracked into the tent and doesn't take up much room in the trunk. Also use it to sweep up floor in the sedan.
2,Broke the first time in use.,I use this kit this weekend and when i was setting up the tent is work good. But when I was pulling out the pages from the ground with the tool i was given in the kit the plastic on the pages broke. I had 2 pages broke. I do not recommend you buy this item.
1,For Extremely Soft Ground Only!,"If you plan on camping in places where you have fresh sod and soft dirt, these might work. I don't camp in the back yard, so when I took it to a sand based camping area just off a lake in Utah, the rubber mallet broke while I was pounding the first stake in. The plastic piece attached to the stake also failed on 2 of the 4 stakes when I pulled them out. Stakes themselves are pretty good but the rest of this kit is just plain cheap crap."
2,"Good hammer and stakes, but . . . . . . .","The rubber mallet and stakes are good. They both worked more than adequately even in the rocky ground where first used. Remainder of the items are really not worth the price. Broom/pan are really small and cheap plastic. Stake puller may be OK in softer ground, but easily bent the first time it was used pulling stakes. Should say, though, that stakes were driven in pretty rocky ground and rather hard to pull, so puller may work OK in softer ground. Overall, item is probably overpriced for what you get."
1,Not really worth it,"buy yourself a mallot and a small dust broom/pan, the stakes work, but if you get in something deep, you're gonna break the plastic and the stake puller bent. I'm keeping the mallot and the dust pan, trashing everything else. And the mesh bag gets caught on the brisiles of the broom."
3,Meh,The dust pan and stakes work great. The mallet handle is made of low quality wood. Save yourself the weight/space and pack a hatchet to do the hammering. The stake puller seems useful only if you're feeling lazy or don't want to put your fingers in dirt/snow.
4,worthwhile tent accessory,"A worthwhile tent accessory that doesn't take up a lot of space or add a lot of weight to your bag. The mallet is on the heavy side but does the job; the stakes worked well enough, but the stake remover is on the cheap end for quality purposes (it bends a little too easily); the broom and dustpan help in a pinch, but the mesh bag is on the small side and kinda cheap. Overall, if the price is right (i.e. on sale) it's worth the purchase and it'll make the camping experience a little easier too."
3,"Convenient, but cheap","I'd say the most useful pieces are the stake puller and the mallet. The dustpan just fits into the bad, and the corners catch on the mesh, which is a bit annoying. Didn't use the stakes, but I suppose it's handy to have a few extra, and they would do the job of replacing OEM stakes. The whisks on the broom are a little stiff and cheap. Personally, I'd get better components individually (my wife bought it), but for the price, it's a decent value."
3,Not really necessary if you prepare,"This cute little kit is certainly convenient, but as others have said, you're better off just getting the pieces separately and packing them in your own bag. The rubber mallet is the reason I bought this kit, but I should have just used a regular old household hammer. After all, the claw end makes the stake-puller redundant. The stakes themselves should only be used in an absolute emergency - they are really poor quality. The plastic heads break easily and the metal hardly grips the dirt. The broom thing is cute, but it sheds bristles easily. I'm going to just buy a handheld brush from Home Depot and use my own dustpan in the future. If you want to buy the set for convenience and not have to think about remembering to pack a hammer, etc., this kit is worth it, I guess. But if you already own a hammer and dustpan, just buy a packet of nicer quality tent stakes and a nice handbrush and you'll probably end up saving money in the long run!"
2,Not really worth it.,"This kit seems like a decent idea. While some of it is, the stakes (specifically the tops) just don't hold up.The spike part of the stakes is fine. However if you're just a hair off the cheap plastic tops will snap off in a heartbeat. Whether staking down or pulling out.To be honest, the generic, full plastic stakes that came with the tent held up better. They may not last real long, but for how quick these can break you can buy a couple buckets of the general plastic ones.Naturally if you are camping in more rugged environments, you'll be spending the extra money for the really good stakes. However for the general use car camper, I'd look past this set and load up on the cheaper, heavier plastic ones. The lack of quality in the hook/eye portion of the stakes with this kit just aren't worth the price."
2,Coleman tent kit,"This might be useful for someone who has never camped before and doesn't have a broom, a claw hammer, or access to a Wal-mart store. Go to Wal-mart and buy some tent stakes to replace those bent wires that came with the tent, buy a cheap broom and shorten the handle, get a cheap dust pan, and use your hammer to pound and pull the tent stakes."
1,UM,not much you can say about cleaning supplys for camping it is what they claim but the tent spikes make it worth it
2,Stakes are better at holding down than the plastic head and stake puller are at getting them out.,"Bought this mainly for the stakes and stake puller. Needed more heavy duty stakes for my Coleman Sundome tent. Stakes will hold your tent down like a rock. Unfortunately, the stake puller is too weak to pull them out of the ground. The plastic top of the stake will also break when trying to get these out. The stake puller is simply a metal (aluminum maybe?) rod bent to a W shape with a handle on one end. It will get a stake out of soft wet ground, but will bend in drier harder soil. I'm not talking rocky soil, the stakes went into the ground with the help of the rubber hammer that comes with the kit. Getting them out first bent the puller, then broke the plastic end of the stake, finally required a camp shovel."
5,This is a must-have for camping with small children!,"Wish we would have had this during our last camping trip! Once the kids got over the excitement of a big, brand new tent and running back & forth inside to outside ... boy did we have a dirt mess. I am really looking forward to using this (oh, and the rubber mallet would have been nice too)!"
2,Not Sure,"I am really supprised that Coleman put thier name on this kit. Well, sorry two pieces in this kit. What I am talking sbout is what they call a dust pan and dust broom. These items should be included in a childs tent kit. The dust pan dosen't even measure 5"" X 5"". Same with the dust broom, if that is what it is. The mallot seems to be really sturdy and well made. The tent stakes seem alright considering they have a plastic top. We will see how the stake puller works when I tear down the tent.........update commimg. All in all I am not really happy with this kit, but I guess it is Ok for the price."
1,Mallet is no good,The mallet broke the first day. I like Coleman products but I'll never order something like this from them again.
2,"ehh, usefull but could be much better","Okay so this little item was cheap but....Pros:Heavy duty metal in stakes.Nice little removal tool.Cons:Plastic heads on stakes spin and slide on stake shafts. (They don't feel like they will last very long)Bag is mesh and the broom gets stuck when putting it in or out,a pain.Only 4 stakes. (I know, I know that is what is pictured. But if your buying a tent at the same time it might catch you off guard. Just sayin...)Hammer kind of on the lighter side. (If you have hard surface might be a problem)I would just go buy stakes at the store next time."
3,The deal is in the pegs.,I got this because of the pegs.As for the peg puller it's pretty much useless.Hammer and bag helps. Haven't used the broom.Did I say the peg puller is useless?Maybe I just don't know how to use it.Wish I had some instructions.
5,Very handy to have,Very handy kit to have for tent setup and cleanup. I love all parts of this kit except that the bag is too small to easily put everything back in. Not a huge deal b/c I just put the broom & dustpan in the tent bag itself.
1,this stinks!,"Seriously, it stinks. The head of the mallet is made of plastic that smells absolutely horrible. I didn't even take it out of the packaging. This will definitely be returned!"
5,Tent Set,I haven't had a chance to use it yet but it feels like a quality product because of the sturdy material.
4,For the Elk 'Buff',"I am grateful for the informative nature of this book...if one can be a 'Civil War Buff', then I suppose that I am an Elk Buff, as well. A Buff is a newcomer, a pilgrim...and that is what this book is aimed at. The author has gauged the greenhorn pretty well and anticipated questions about the animals, their smells and foods, and the details such as the weather and terrain in which one finds the giant creatures.Because 'The Elk Hunter' is in my mitts, I feel a a tremendous weight of ignorance lifted from my shoulders about my upcoming elk hunt. I just pity my three companions, who don't have this book in their backpacks.Laubach and Henckel are not necessarily great writers, but pretty straightfoward communicators about the subject on which they can lecture in their sleep. There is a credibility that seeps out of the covers of the book, that this is the real deal. When the cover wears out, tape it back on and keep it handy.Thos. B. Fowler"
4,Very sensitive,These binoculars are much too sensitive for the casual viewer wanting to catch a glimpse of a star or a bird in a tree. They have to be held very steady. I need a tripod.
4,good stuff,"This sorta music has a very, very, very, VERY small ""niche"", but if you're into beer, metal and all things Germanic then this is for you. If you're into Sodom, thrash metal, hard punk rock or German beer-drinking songs turned up 11 notches then you might have to get this. Or maybe you're just totally politically incorrect. Whatever, Tom Angelripper pulls no punches whatsoever. Motorhead fans, and those fans of Die Toten Hosen and the Sex Pistols should take heed.Get this album, get totally drunk and rock the ... out!!!!!"
5,Woody would be dancing the hora!!,The Klezmatics have made a superb record here. I highly recommend this CD to anyone with an interest in Woody Guthrie's Jewish connections and inspirations. Fans of the Klezmatics will love it as well...
1,Caps were swelled up,"Called when i recieved the mother board and tod them i had a md just like the one they sent, they replaced it."
2,"Not a ""How to book""","I read several critics reviews before making the purchase and was very excited about an instinctive method book. I read it from cover to cover over a weekend. I then went out Monday evening, full of warm and fuzzy feelings about dog training, to apply what I thought I learned and found myself staring at the dog not knowing where to start. I understand that the books overall theme was not just about yard work but I found the book more philosophical about the method and fell short where the rubber meets the road. I did use some of the material to tweak others teachers methods (Tarrant, Long or Smith). The book reads like a compilation of magazine articles that are loosely related and rambles a little to much for my taste(side bar information about his favorite dogs). It is a good winter fire side read and I highly recommend it as that, but not as an owners first hands on training reference."
2,Don't be fooled!,"Don't confuse this book like I did with We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell. Same title, different authors. Having accidentialy ordered Cormier's, I read it. It was Ok, a descent enough suspense novel, although honestly, nothing much more than that. Caldwell's novel, though is a brutal, wrenching, disturbing exploration into evil and the end of the world. It's the kind of book that'll keep you up nights and stick with you for the rest of your life. Cormier's novel is good for passing a Sunday afternoon, Caldwell's is the kind of book that makes you look at who you are and the way you live in a totally different light."
4,We All Fall Down,"This book is a very good book,because the author get to the heart of being a teenager and how easily a teenager can get caught up in a situation that they no longer have control over. He also makes very vivid the pain and angish that all of the kids felt."
3,Kindle edition-numerous typos,"I did enjoy the story itself, however, referring to the Kindle edition, the typos were ridiculous. Obviously this edition was not proofed. I stopped counting after about 40 typos. While I did enjoy the book, the typos are very distracting."
4,Great plot!,"I liked this book; it's a mysterious story about action and its consequences.Jane falls in love with someone who is also responsible for the fact that her sister Karen is in a coma. The Avenger saw everything and he knows everything; he wants to take revenge....Cormier takes you into a world of teenagers dealing with issues like growing up, making decisions, love, alcoholism, regret and lies. It's a compelling story and it's thrilling to find out who The Avenger is. The plot will surprise you!"
2,A huge dissapointment from a great author,"What was Cormier thinking? I loved all his books up until now. This book was pretentious, unintellegent, extremely self-reightous novel that was unfocused, unfulfillig, unrealistic, and just plain bad. Cormier did propose some good ideas, and somehow got me through the whole thing. The idea of the avenger was okay for a while and what it turned out to be was neat (I was almost afraid he was blaming violence in television...close one). But the characters were very manufactured and contrived, and the book was just a disspointment.Now let's analyze the allegory. That's right. Robert Cormier, an awesome awesome writer, uses metaphors to compare...alcoholism and the Black Plague? What the heck? Look, alcoholism isn't good, but it isn't the Black Plague! I all around do not recommend this book. Instead, read Fade or After the First Death or I am the Cheese or In the Middle of the Night because...sorry Cormier, this one did not work out at all."
1,Not worth the time,"I read this book for school last year, and i was pretty excited to start it because it sounded like it would be good. By the time i got past the first chapter, however, I could tell that I was going to be disappointed. The author introduces a lot of issues into the book that he never really follows up on. For a book that is only a little over 100 pages, he shouldn't have included so many tangents that never seem to have any closure, and leaves you wondering what ever happened. The build-up to the climax, to find out who the ""avenger"" is, is the only good part about the book. I got a shock when i found out who it was, but the climax ended way too simply and way too early to keep me from being disappointed. It took me much longer to finish this book than it should have because I never wanted to read it. If i hadn't been forced to finish it, i probably wouldn't have. It's not worth the time it takes to read it."
1,This is another bad book by Robert Cormier!!,"This book is about a girl who moved to anotherstate, and her house gets trashed. Mr. Cormierstretches the plot to the point that you want tothrow the book away and never see it again.I believe that all of Mr. Cormier's books are bad,and he is not a very good author in my opinion."
1,NOT for Children,"The book was given such a low rating from me, because how can this book be advertised as been appropriate for children under 15 or so? It's readily available on middle-school library shelves, where unsuspecting children, expecting a book in the vein of ""The Chocolate Wars"", pick up this book, and are left with more questions than answers.How many parents have been forced to deal with the issue of rape with their child due to their unintentional reading of the subject. Not to mention drug use, vandalism.Ugh. The system should be ashamed of putting such a book in the hands of children unprepared for such adult topics."
2,Movie message: Aliens are your gods & you're all goin' dowwwwn!,"Warning: I have to pretty much tell the end of the movie to give my review. So you can skip this or read it later I guess.I remember the first disaster film I saw, Towering Inferno, about a skyscraper going down. Now there are so many movies about the entire planet going down!Some people say this is Hollywood, using their frequent device of ""predicitive programming."" Interesting concept.I just ""love"" how the aliens look with so much compassion on the human beings that they know are in imminent danger of obliteration. 'Course with all their incredible technology they don't bother to save more than two of them, children they place on another planet that is obviously meant to be a sort of garden of Eden, complete with what must be a Tree of Life.If you want to believe that aliens are your gods, & that they are going to sit back and watch while the planet is destroyed, wow, what fun. Bring extra popcorn!"
2,Nicholas Cage plays the same character in every movie.,Length:: 1:41 MinsThis is our review of Knowing.
4,This movie was crazy!,"Knowing is about a widower named John and his 9 year old son, Caleb. Caleb's school dig up a time capsle from 50 years ago and each child gets a different envelope with a picture inside(drawn by the children 50 years ago). Caleb's envelop has a page with numbers written all over it. He takes it home and after he goes to bed John is looking at it and figures out there are codes to major disasters that have happened in the past 50 years and there are only 3 in the future.This movie is intense. Lots of action. There are a few parts that scared me too. Nicholas Cage did a great job.**************SPOILERS**************I was just wondering if I missed something with the whole alien thing. They didnt seem to explain where they came from or why they were helping us."
2,Childish but not a children's film,"Nothing hung together! Watch it to see some Cage high anxiety facial expressions and a couple of scenes of him running. But then once you have the idea that he is stressed, fast forward to a couple of good disaster scenes. Then maybe look for another film to watch.I won't bother to list all the ways that the various parts of the film did not hang together LOGICALLY because with hundreds of reviews and comments before me surely these must have been covered and I don't want to be here all night just to defend saying that this was a silly film. I am pretty forgiving about big-buck films and small-buck films. But this one was a bomb across the board however one want's to classify it. Even seeing it largely as a religious film it falls quite short of the average ones that make the big screen. Of course it is above Bibleman, even though Bibleman does actually does move some viewers and get a few high ratings."
5,Great Video and Audio Quality. Great Movie,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was excellent, like it should be for a Blu-Ray of a new movie. 2.35:1.The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was excellent also.I watched this movie on satellite, and just had to have it. It is great, especially on Blu-Ray. You must like movies that have deep thought to them. It is not a comedy."
2,Good special effects,"I bought this movie because (1)I am a Nicholas Cage fan,(2)The idea of the film is great and (3)The special effects in this movie were outstanding. That was the good part.For the most part I was bored with the story hoping that it would pick up. The actors (Cage too) were dull. The worst Nicholas Cage movie I have seen."
3,Great Special Effects,"This movie was good, until the end with the aliens. What I really liked about this movie were the special effects. Excellent with the subway disaster and the crashing plane. I was blown away by the special effects and I love the acating of Nicholas Cage."
4,DEJA VU,"I've only just got around to seeing this film/movie (March 2010). A competent film of its type. The CGI was not too cardboard and generally realistic. This story is not an uplifting one but then it could never be. I haven't read all the reviews - too many - so someone else might have picked up the flavour of Childhood's End by Arthur C Clarke. I read it years ago so I can't remember if there was the prediction element, but I certainly remember being very depressed by it for some time. But, hey, if we expected every film/story to be jolly, we'd all be deserving of deletion from the planet.Stevie"
4,KNOWING IS OK,"FIRST I FOUND IT MORE SCI FI THAN SPIRITUAL. HOW? WELL FIRST OFF SINCE WHEN IS GOD AN ALIEN BEING WHO COMES IN SPACE SHIPS AND TALKS TO KIDS IN WHISPERS?I SAW AT THE END HOW SOMEONE COULD GO SCREAMING OMG ITS THE GARDEN OF EDEN WITH KIDDIES.BASICALLY THE EARTH IS GONNA GO BOOM.AND ALIEN RACE THAT IS KINDER AND GENTLER THAN WE ARE DECIDES TO GIVE US A SECOND CHANCE.UM WHERE DOES GOD COME UP? HE DOESN'T..... IT'S ET, MAYBE THE VULCANS WHO KNOWS WHAT RACE BUT IT ISN'T GOD IN ANYWAY.I WOULD HOPE IF WE EVER GET ADVANCED ENOUGH IN TECH WE WOULD FIND OTHER WORLDS THAT ARE POPULATED AND GO HOLY SMOKES THAT ONES IS GONNA GO BOOM AND RUN OVER AND SAVE SOME OF THEM... BUT HUMANS ARE NOT KNOWN TO BE NICE.I LOVED THE MOVIE AND IM NOT A FAN OF CAGE! I AM COMING AROUND NOW THAT HE DID THE MOLE ON G FORCE .BRING ON THE HATE MAIL I KNOW ITS COMING BUT IF YOU ARE SO INSECURE YOU HAVE TO FIND GOD IN EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH ALIENS GET OVER IT"
2,Decent B movie. Ending makes no sense.,"***MAJOR SPOILER WARNING***For those who have seen this movie, isnt it a little funny that they are so powerful at the end and yet can't just fix the problem or deflect the blast? lol."
3,Great Premise Fell Apart 1/2 Way Thru,"I will not post any spoilers here, but what started out as a great 5-star music fell apart about 45 minutes into the film when too much was revealed and the main plot and susequent ending became exposed....... then for the last half of the movie it simply got a bit silly waiting for what you knew was coming."
2,Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be!!!,"It started off pretty good. I liked the beginning when it showed the classic 1950's. It was kinda scary a few times with those 'Whisperers' The things that got to me were seeing the people burn after the plane crash, dying in the subway, and the depressing ending. Nicolas Cage did a really good job, as did everybody else, and thought the special effects were pretty cool, but toward the end seemed silly, involving some kind of alien/angel/demon thing. It was confusing toward the end. I probably wouldn't recommend KNOWING!!!"
2,Terrible movie... prepare to be bored and little intrigued,"This movie was intriguing in the beginning, but the whole movie is rather monotone. There isn't any real action and the plot develops really slowly. Nicolas Cage gives us a rather boring performance with emotion that doesn't make you believe it's reality.Skip this movie."
2,Pass on this one,Just not a great movie. The characters' actions and motivations often don't really make sense and the overall message is about as subtle as a sledge hammer. There are too many good movies (and books) out there to waste an evening on this one.
1,Not even a good sci-fi film,"I just watched Knowing and was actually relieved when my dvd started skipping at the end.This movie was just bad all around. The acting was sub-par and there was no character development at all. Situations happened in the movie where there was no explanation given at all. An example was that the leading lady (I can't even remember her name) shows up at Cage's house, yet he never told her his name or how to get a hold of him.I felt no emotion for any of the characters and was actually happy to see the almost ending (I saw up until the last scene and figured it wasn't worth it to try to get my dvd player not to skip).I do not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,"Cheesy FX, uncomfortable Cage, & goofy script","I gave this 2 stars only for the depiction of pandemonium towards the end and the fact that it's mildly entertaining. Otherwise....spoilers below......Most of the FX are incredibly cheesy, the woman turns out to be an idiot, Nicolas Cage seems very uncomfortable the whole time, the dialogue is mostly pretty bad, and the script is definitely on the goofy side. At least there isn't a total deus ex machina, but where the kids end up--with the implication of a new Eden--is just plain silly.Good thing I had this one as a free rental."
1,Creepy and poor,"As someone who does not enjoy scary movies much, I would normally pass on watching this movie. However, I went to the movie with my boyfriend at the time (he persuaded me enough), and I sat with my eyes closed the majority of the time. If you do not like scary movies, poppy scenes, religion, or sci-fi, you probably won't like this movie. It was a very disturbing movie to say the least, but I will admit that it definitely makes you think. Had I been a fan of scary movies, I would say this is a decent movie, however the ending is just absolutely dredful. Both my boyfriend at the time and I walked out of the theater absolutely disgusted by the ending. Definitely not one of Nicholas Cage's best works."
1,"Nicholas Cage tries to Channel ""Signs"" - fails","Nicholas Cage tries to Channel ""Signs"" - fails, ""I tried to make sense out of it"" - but he didn't!Odd music and strange happenings do NOT make a movie, I used to want to see anything he did, no longer."
3,Good movie up until the last 10 minutes,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good sci-fi, but I personally don't care for sci-fi's that end like this one did. 90% of the movie = great as far as the CG, the acting, the script, etc. I'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan and normally enjoy his movies, but this one, at the very end...very disappointing. Maybe some will like it more than others, but I won't be buying a copy. Not worth it in my opinion. I think the movie would have had a much better ending had it wrapped up in a more interesting man-driven conspiracy."
5,One of my favorite movies.,"I loved this movie, I have watched it many times. I believe in Aliens, physic happenings, so for me it was an awesome movie. It very spiritual, but it made me feel just how small and vulnerable we are in this universe. THAT'S OK THOUGH."
3,Reasonably good until the end,I rented this movie to watch and found it reasonably entertaining for most of the film. However when it came time to start tying up loose threads at the end it turned cliche and left me unsatisfied and disappointed.
1,TOTAL WASTE OF EVERYTHING,"This was the most absurd, horrible, retarded, ludicrous movie created. Nicholas Cage was the only good actor and this wasn't his best acting and probably was his worst script. Drama led nowhere. I never leave reviews, BUT IF MY REVIEW SAVES SOMEONE 2 HOURS BY NOT WATCHING THIS THEN THIS WAS WORTH MY FEW MINTUES after wasting my 2 hours on this junk! DONT GET DRAWN IN BY THE BEGINNING. IT STARTS OFF LOOKING LIKE SOMETHING MIGHT TURN OUT, BUT IT WON'T. The pseudo-spiritual overtones could make an agnostic and full-blown believer sick and throwing up over each other. The suspense is just annoying. way too long. cheap ending. need i say more??? stop reading reviews for this movie and go watch any other one and you will guaranteed be watching a much better flic! oh, and this would have gotten 0 stars, but amazon makes 1 star the lowest rating..."
1,promising... but......,"this movie had a lot of promise. there was some really great intrigue that could have been built up.I even didn't hate it until the last half hour - forty five minutes.But it passed by all the possibilities for intrigue, for really unique things happening, and then jumped completely to (SPOILER ALERT) ALIENS. In the last fifteen minutes.it's yet another end of the world, we're all going to die, movie, with very little to recommend it. The interesting parts or the potential for itneresting things are bypassed and ignored, or not developed enough.Don't bother. You're better off not Knowing."
1,Disappointing,"Perhaps I was expecting too much. I thought this would be a good science thriller, and I really like Nicolas Cage. Instead, I found aliens and an ending with an idea that's already been done sooo many times. And a tree of knowledge thrown in at the end to make sure we knew what was being portrayed, in case we could possibly have missed it. I found Cage's acting to be stiff and equally disappointing. Actually, the entire movie seemed stiff and contrived to me, a hodge-podge of ideas from other movies, and totally predictable about half-way through."
2,"Special-effects movie, nothing more, move along","The movie would have rated 3-stars except for the silly ending. I weep for the reviewers who found this movie ""profound"". On the other hand, loved the Beethoven 7th. Even a bad movie can't keep B down."
1,"Nice visuals, bad story.","The story doesn't carry well. It could've been better if the movie didn't have an 'unknowing' ending. They leave a lot to the imagination of the viewer, but far too much for us to guess at."
1,"THis movie is so bad it should have it's own category, lame","This movie really starts out very interesting, then it takes a dive into the dark side of spirituallity. If you are looking for a depressing movie with a dark outlook and no sense of humour or hope then this is for you."
1,What a disappointing and dumb movie... Read why without any spoiler...,"In one word, if you don't believe in Darwinism, you'll love this movie !!!In another word, it's quiet a stupid movie... Unfortunately, with N.Cage in it.Like so many great actors, he 's in this stage of his career where he seems to be choosing pretty bad projects one after another.This movie is quiet entertaining at the beginning but then, starts to drag, and drag, and drag and then explodes in a terribly stupid ending (with a minute of pretty good CGI effect I have to say) that makes you forgot the - few - good things about it, including this 1 minute of pretty good effect...I am a big fan of Sci-Fi & Thriller movies, and this one will be forgotten very soon, trust me...What a waist of time... In the making and in the watching!"
1,Only about 10 minutes of special effects!!,"Some people claim to have gotten a religious experience from watching this turkey. These must be the same people who invested with Bernie Madoff or who bought stock in AIG. This end of the world film has only about 10 minutes of special effects. There is a passenger jet crash, a subway crash that looks like it was done with miniatures, and some quickie scenes of cities being consumed with flames during the last 7 minutes. The rest of the film is a total bore. Some people HATE Michael Bay, but at least when you watch a Michael Bay film, it's not going to be boring. (Okay, Transformers 2 was a little long)."
1,"horrible, awful movie","I was amazed to see ANY positive reviews for this terrible movie. It was a total, eye rolling disappointment--made more so by having a cool premise. But in the end, it was a cheesy let down--even before the end, actually. It took itself so seriously it was almost funny, in a groaning sort of way. How could you not laugh at the classroom scene, when he suddenly gets all pensive in front of his class. So Hollywood fake. Don't waste you time with this."
2,Eh...,"This movie was predictable. And, when it tried to shake things up, I though the storyline disappointed.It seems like it didn't know what type of a movie it wanted to be. It started by trying to be a thriller/drama that turned into an apocalyptic Sci-Fi movie (and a not very good one at that). It failed as a drama because it never developed the characters enough to make you care about them. The sci-fi elements were predictable. I believe that the scene at the very end of the movie was added only because they wanted to add some special effects. I'm all for special effects but not when they don't help advance the storyline.All in all, I'm sorry I bought the DVD."
2,VERY disappointed....,This movie had so much potential - it started off kind of good - i was really getting into it - very cool special effects - but of course it had to take a cooky hollywood ending that made the entire movie STUPID. i was very disappointed. I'm sorry I wasted my $4 on renting it. Maybe if it was $.99 day or something - but I could think of a thousand movies that would have been better than this.
3,"Not Bad, But Ending Stunk","I really enjoyed this movie right until the end. Hated the ending.It has a kind of M. Night Shyalaman (sp?) feel to it and Nicholas Cage does a good job not being Nicholas Cage, with some of his usual acting quirks. There is a lot of mystery as to what is really going on, and I even like the alien angle. However, I'm not too hot on the blatant bible Armageddon track of the story. Though they didn't quote scripture, per se, that Ezekiel drawing kind of nudged one in that direction, along with a few other subtle references. I don't think this was necessarily a religious movie though.Overall, I enjoyed it right until the end, then it let me down. Otherwise it would have got more stars. Recommended for fans of bummer endings."
5,Pleasantly Entertained,"I don't comment too often about movies, but this movie was absolutely enjoyable from beginning to end. I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews. Watch this film with an open mind and expecting the unexpected. As other reviews have stated; if you don't care for religeous symbolism or Nick Cage, you probably won't like the movie. Otherwise, enjoy the apacolypse!"
4,Unusual:,"Where many other movies are cookie cutters of previous films, this premise is completely new and the action scenes mix territory with though processes as the mystery unravels."
2,ITS STARTS WELL! BUT THEN...,"I liked the start very much - the film about predictions and the end of the world was riveting to begin with...until the last 45 minutes when it completely fell apart...and when that happens I get very annoyed. I take back it was good from the start...it had a lot of very stupid NOT communicating all throughout the film, especially Nicholas Cage. And the over-dramatization was merciless. All that said, if you like sci-fi and are willing to forgive the many pregnant moments, you will probably enjoy the film."
1,How can a studio spend tens of millions to produce,"such crap? It's unbelievable.The ""whisper people"" aka aliens, aka angels of some sort came to the doomed humanity with the sole purpose to save two kids and two bunnies. Even if you presume there were more of these aliens all over the world and they had planned to save more kids and bunnies (maybe some other fauna, it's hard to find any sense in this devastatingly stupid story.Fifty years of whispering to no end. They might have just landed and grabbed those kids. It would have taken a few minutes at best.while watching this ""movie"", if you didn't feel the weight on nonsense descending on you and squeezing your brain out of your skull, then you are a buyer fit for wasting your money on more of the similar nonsense.Good thing I didn't buy it."
2,"Bad script, Bad story","Unlike National Treasure and Next, Cage finally fell flat on his face with this one. The movie is slow. -Spoiler warning- Secondly, the banter between cage and his professor colleague is horrible, these are brillant minds? Thirdly, the coincidence of the plane landing almost on him, please. Fourthly, the ending was totally lame and the mystery was never explained, not even attempted. Spooky guys walking around in suits that later dematerialize, with nothing explained, just stupid. Oh and of course we find out Cage is widowed right off the bat, way to use the easy sympathy card there. So many places the script just stank, and the story the same in the end. Stinker!"
2,worst plot since the happening,"this movie sucked so bad. i saw the commercials and thought that it would be interesting and good, and it was, until the aliens showed up in the last half of the movie. i dont regret watching it though, cause now my family and i can talk about the ""the whispering people"""
1,Wow. This was just....awful,"The premise wasn't bad really. A time capsule buried by a middle school and then dug up 50 years later contains a mysterious page filled with numbers. The child who discovers it in the capsule shows it to his father, who starts to see patterns in the numbers. Patterns that aren't real nice.Lately, we've seen a lot of movies which have 'surprise' endings that make you think 'Wow, never saw THAT coming!'. This tries to be one of those but not in a good way. After moving along one path, the movie suddenly turns into 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. It's jarring and frankly it gave me a headache.When I was a kid in high school creative writing class, one of the things we learned was 'Never write yourself into a corner that you can't get out of without pulling a rabbit out of your hat, because that's cheating!'. Too bad the writers of this script didn't take that class. They even included the rabbit!"
2,Hokey movie,"I just finished watching this absurd movie that ends with two little white children with two white rabbits being left off to repopulate a new planet because the old world burned up. I thought it was one of the dumber movies I've seen. It did have some intense disaster scenes and was kind of creepy at times. Funny how Nick Cage can always find a parking space even when an entire city is in a state of mayhem because the world is about to fry. Oh, and he has nice neat religious conversion at the end too. Whoopee."
4,"The Ending Asks ""Why""?","Without going into all the details, the ending of this film begs the question of why the events of the film were even needed.Well, beyond that, this film had some great action scenes that you would not expect. Good acting and a fairly good script. The ending will make you ask yourself, ""Why?"""
5,Really good!,"I see some haven't given many stars here...However, I loved it. In fact, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is. In fact, I was crying at the end! I know some folks didn't like the way it ended...Yet, I can see that it is a plausible possibility...if one wants to ponder such things. For me, it had a lot of depth and meaning...I would like to know this author better...I didn't see he had a book on it...but he is listed as being the one who wrote the story...Ryne Douglas Pearson. Again, it far surpassed my expectations! I'd give it ten stars if I could. If I am wrong about the author, I hope someone will correct me..."
3,Fine movie,I am not a Nicholas Cage fan but I decided to watch this movie because of the subject. It was okay though A LOT of segi affects. I didn't care for the ending. The acting was relatively good though I wasn't familiar with anyone in the cast but Nicholas Cage. I would recommend to watch this before purchasing the dvd.
5,Effects of Knowledge on People,"This movie shows a variety of effects knowledge has on people. they react in different ways towards the information they have received. Fear, anger and irrational behavior are typical when dire prognostications are believed.It also points to 2012 solar storm and what happens leading up to the apex of the event and how it would look on Earth as it occurs, how the media reports and how government agencies respond all the way to the end.The cast works well with nic and his portrayal of the central character, they add to his emotioal portrayal in subtle ways that the audience is always able to follow what is going on in his world and his current and future choices."
3,"4 star movie, 1 star ending","The first 45 minutes of this film was worth the money spent to view it. It begins as a taut Sherlock Holmes mystery filled with some dynamite special effects. The crashing of a large jet passenger plane outdoes the plane crash scene in Cast Away. Sadly, there was no way to explain the strange happenings without employing a very dissatisfying ending. When all was said and done, no explanation was given for anything that happened. Why was the child that started the circle of events chosen to do so? Why was it necessary for Nicholas Cage to figure out the meaning of the list of numbers? What good did it do? It seems that the mysterious strangers had power enough to eliminate the need for all the hard work. They actually eliminated the need for the making of this movie. Watch it until the plane crash, fast forward to the special effects showing the total destruction scenes. You may think the movie wasn't bad at all."
3,How to kill a movie in the last 20 mins,"Great movie with top action and a fascinating theme on numbers !!! We were riveted to the chair right up to the last 20 minutes !! Sadly the movie faded and dribbled away into a whole load of garbled Googah !! But it is definately worthy of watching the rest so why not !! buy it and switch of the last 20 minutes and your own imaginated generate the end outcome !! "" That's All Folks"""
2,Wish I'd Known,"The movie begins reasonably enough. A primary school class prepares essays for a 50 year time capsule. One little girl is seen busily writing a stream of digits onto a page which is snatched from her before she can finish and goes into the capsule. Enter Nick Cage 50 years later whose son becomes the recipient of this seemingly incomprehensible missive. The rest of the movie is a discovery of what this mysterious writing means and how the principal characters deal with the implications.A great hook, to be sure. However, if you are looking for an uplifting movie, I'd recommend you'd pass. The special effects are disturbing, graphic, but not necessarily gory. There is a certain detachment throughout which mollifies some of the impact of the concluding, fantastic ending.Not quite as big a downer as Kubrick's AI, ""Knowing"" probably merits at most one viewing. Wish I'd known."
2,"sorry, wrong number","has the feel of a movie that might have been based on a really good scifi story, and then thoughtfully developed....instead, knowing has far too much difficulty deciding what it is about, and leaves that onerous task to you....oh yes, i regard it as the beginning of an explanation that k had no less than 4 writers; and what is infinitely worse....cage was one of them....actors are almost equally infallible at ruining movies they produce and perform in....dude, this just usn't your metier....ciao."
3,Cage decodes a prophecy of disaster..,"Fifty years after a time capsule was buried at a elementary school, professor John Koestler discovers a pattern to the numbers written on a sheet of paper.When he tells his family and a colleague about this, they are convinced he's crazy- that is, until the events he predicts come true.There are a few other predictions yet future, and most of the film is consumed with his efforts to stop them from happening.Cage is convincing in this film; the other secondary characters though seem lifeless (under-developed, under-written) compared to his character.The overall theme of the film seems to be trying to find meaning in the seemingly meaningless events and random tragedies that occur to the human race daily. How you (the viewer) interpret these events depends on your world-view and spiritual belief system."
1,I'd prefer a colonoscopy,"There should be a money-back clause for movies that cause temporary insanity in the form of deep depression about American culture...Nicholas Cage needs to expand his repertoire of expressions to, let me see... TWO! My son and I had a bet on how long it would take him to get back to the broom closet...I lost. I couldn't believe it would take the whole movie! (I can't believe I saw the whole movie!) Conclusion: Don't know how to spell that sound..."
1,Try 0 Stars,"2 hours of my life that I will never have back. So bad that I'm not even going to waste any more time discussing it. Just avoid this. If you want to see it, fine, go rent it for a dollar or so."
4,Gives you something to ponder concerning the nature of reality.,"Personally, I found this film to be a worthwhile effort. I did not feel like I had wasted a couple of hours of my life. In fact, I felt that something whorthwhile had been added to my life to contemplate.Without giving anything away, there is a big concept at the heart of this script- it takes direct experience of the so called impossible to break through the modern materialist mindset. That is what astrophysicist Cage must contend with- the absolute shattering of his preceived image of how the world works. You can't get much more dramatic than that.As for the secondary theme of the end of the world, it is more than mere sensationalism..."
4,"Good Movie, have to pay attention or you will get lost!","I had to watch this movie two times to really figure out what was going on. I really did enjoy it, even though I prefer movies that make me feel good at the end, with this movie I was left going "" huh? "" I had to watch it again, and then the plot made more sense.I gave it 4 stars as I really do like Nicolas Cage, and this movie did have suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat in many parts. If I would have paid for it at the theater, it would have been worth the $9+ bucks for me."
2,"Good subject, poor writing.","I was very disappointed in this movie. I purchased it based on the commercials I saw on TV, and because Nicolas Cage was the main actor.The story line was good, but it lacked a good ending. Obviously, the writers didn't know what to do with it.This is not a good movie for Nicolas Cage credits. I expected much more from it.Too bad DVDs can't be returned - this is one that I would have returned post haste.Before I purchase another DVD I will pay Brighthouse for the money first to see if it is worth it or not."
3,Creepy,"I'll pretty much watch anything with Nicholas Cage... This one ventures into territory which has been extensively mined in the past. Still, a good flick!"
3,"Good movie, a more science fiction shot of the Bible, I believe.","This movie was good, the story was strong, I felt. The acting was well, all tho I'm no fan of Nic Cage. I think this movie gave it's own interpretation of the supernatural, the spiritual and the Bible. I feel that people may take it all to seriously and see it for more of a message behind it. I didn't see it that way, I saw it as a fantasy, based on it's own interpretations. I myself am a Christian, all tho I think it's arrogant for someone to assert that Christians are unreasonable and unintelligent, as I'm often told. I come from a well educated family and have studied religions for 17years. I feel that if someone used this movie as a truth for what the Bible says, doesn't really understand it possibly, I could be wrong. But getting back to the movie, it was good science fiction for me, would I own it? NO, rent it again? Sure. Red Box, 1 dollar, why not? Again, good story, good acting, good directing."
2,In the end a whole lot of nothing,"This to me was a film that aspired to be many things yet ultimately left me feeling indifferent. I liked some of the concepts the director was playing with yet it all ends up falling apart into a sort of occult mish-mash, which is poor form given that the film is an attempt at science-fiction. If you're into astrology or a big Nick Cage fan (I've never met one personally) then there's probably enough going on here that you'll enjoy the ride but if you're after a sci-fi fix I wouldn't bother."
5,KNOWING-movie,"I am so glad I found this movie, been wanting it for a while. It was well worth the wait. This was a terrific movie but I would not want to know the dates on which disasters are going to happen and certainly would not want to know the number of how many died. Nick Cage was terrific as always. It was an edge of seat type of movie. It was a very good movie and one that I've seen no other like. It's worth the time to watch."
4,Knowing Was a Really Good Movie,"Knowing was really good. The end is kind of weird but for you religious folks out there, if you think about God making a revelation with the new world, the end is kind of like that. But you other not so religious people, its still a good movie with a weird ending."
3,Better than I expected,"After seeing the trailer and seeing that Nicholas Cage was the star I thought ""here we go again"". I think he is a very overrated actor who has really put out some garbage lately. That said, this movie was not that bad and kept my interest. Cage was not bad in it."
2,Been a fan for a long time . . .,"I have been a fan of Nicholas Cage since ""Raising Arizona"" :Trapped in Paradise: and ""The Rock."" As you can tell a long time. This movie just was plain weird. You can probably tell by most of the reviews that the movie is pretty cool, yet predictable up until the last half hour. Cage plays a good role, but the script is crap! You might recognize Chandler Canterbury from Benjamin Button, or that really creepy episode of Criminal Minds; He plays a naive boy that can't figure out that the voices that are whispering in his head are aliens. Overall the movie sucks, I only give it two stars, because Nicholas Cage did a pretty good acting job in it."
4,What sci-fi used to be,"While not a perfect film, I really enjoyed how this film hearkened back to the science fiction of old. Modern science fiction has simply become action/adventure in space (or wherever) and when you find a classic sci-fi film being made (i.e.Contactor Knowing), it's a good bet that most modern audiences aren't going to enjoy it.This isn't a bad movie, it's a great movie (poorly marketed) looking for an audience. If you enjoyedClose Encounters,Contact,2001, or similar flicks, I highly suggest you at least rent Knowing and give it a shot."
3,I just saw one about 2012...,"Apocalyptic sci-fi with aliens are pretty popular withthe global warming happening before our eyes.I kind of enjoyed this ""whispering"" predictionand calling of the chosen type movie.The Mayan calender with it's 2012 date is basedon a long term observed solar cycle.There in no real evidence that there will be aspike in activity at that date. Actually we seem to bein a time when the solar cycle is resetting to a low point.If such a movie makes people think,it may well be a good thing,like the flying saucer movies of the 50's."
2,Bad video in DVD ...,"I think that the industry should stop to make DVDs. This film is good, but the video on DVD is bad. I'm waiting to see it in blu-ray ..."
4,pretty good but not the best effort from proyas,"good camera work and great soundtrack,plot could have been more weird for my liking.Nic was Nic as always which is not a good thing."
1,The worst movie I have seen this year-- maybe even the worst in 5 years,"A friend of mine said this movie was, ""okay,"" I'm still not speaking to him. I had to watch it to the end out of morbid fascination. What is WRONG with Nicholas Cage?? How could a guy who did Raising Arizona allow himself to be in such garbage?? (don't answer, I know-- money)This was a jaw-droppingly stupid film, even the computer generated imagery was poorly done. Cage looks like he is undergoing a painful dental procedure throughout the entire film.Maybe it was made for kids? I don't know-- I don't have kids, but I think they may get scared by some of the scenes (not to mention the idiotic dialogue and plot).I don't think it HAD to be this bad, even though the plot frequently snaps temporary disbelief suspension. It certainly didn't have to be this schlocky! The ending was so sugary it was actually vomitrocious."
2,"Not sci fi, but decent plane/train wrecks","Nothing to spoil here...This is a poorly written (religeous-like) prophecy/salvation flick disguised as a ""science fiction"" movie. The only redeeming qualities (the second star) are a couple of nice CGI wrecks. The Spielberg/Rapture ending is unbelievable."
2,Nope!,"This movie seemed to entertain Roger Ebert and so I gave it a shot even though Nic Cage's acting hasn't been worth anything since ""Birdy"". In any event, the story and logic behind this film are both quite lacking. Things just don't make sense on so many levels. And more than this, what is up with Hollywood's love affair of the end of the world? Its seems to be a very common theme these days. Perhaps they sense that their civilization is coming to an end when this is the quality of art it produces? The ending, and its aesthetic beauty and meaning was probably the only interesting thing about the movie. That and the minimal parallels to 20th Century Boys - a much better film and interesting read. Failure again Cage-san!!!"
1,Knowing Movie never received,"On August 26 I ordered the DVD Knowing, with Nicolas Cage.I never received this DVD. One month has passed and it has not arrived."
1,Warning: Not for those who like happy endings.,This is not for those who watch movies to feel good or who like plausible storylines.
2,"Exciting, scary and sad but worth watching",Totally depressing..don't watch this movie. Father not allowed to go with his son to anotherplnet to survive the end of the world. Childrem selected by dark suited men running around at night...not sure what the point of this movie was except to create depression to those who watch it.
1,damn,nicolas cage is my favorite actor..his acting was perfect as always but...the movie ? coM'on i understand the meaning of the movie and everything but...to me its a waste of time
4,Edge of your seat Drama,"This is not my usual kind of movie to watch but I like Nicholas Cage. It is very exciting and you never know what is going to happen next. It's not predictable like many.I'm not going to spoil any of it for you. It's a mix of science fiction. suspense, drama. Scary to the point it could be real, erie.Don't watch it before bed. :) But do watch it. Hold onto your seat."
2,a mixture of old plots,"Watching the knowing was like watching Final Destination, E.T., The Number 23, and Armageddon all at once. There is nothing new as far as the plot, the special effects were decent, and the acting was decent. The movie overall was a total waste of time and effort. Nick Cage did a poor job in picking a script in this movie due to the plot has been used and abused in many different movies (besides the one's I named) over and over again. Don't waste your time nor your money on this release."
3,I Wish I Didn't Know,"Elementary school students open a time capsule and in it contains a piece of paper with a long list of numbers. The list falls into the hands of a scientists (Cage) who discovers that each set of numbers are the dates of disaster both natural and man made and the amount of people who will lose their lives. But what happens when the numbers end?Though in other reviews that lauded this film, I saw it in the theaters and found it to be visually fantastic and yet overly preachy. The ending was weak and the acting was very wooden and predictable. There were too many plot holes in the story that made it hard to really keep you into it. If you like films about disasters this movie is for you. But there's a caveat, I'd rather rent this than buy it."
3,Know you're in for an eventual payoff to the story,"Nicolas Cage plays a man who comes across a set of numbers that predict ""major"" disasters. Who (or what) is truly behind the prophetic numbers is a question the film leaves open, somewhat, for debate in the final act. Director Alex Proyas tries to make a film that on the surface seems to pit religion and science against each other, but his final message is, ""Yes, Virginia, there is a purpose to everything."" That message comes in a bold and cinematicaly pleasing way in the last 20 minutes of the film, unfortunately it is almost lost amidst a muddled mess for the first hour and twenty minutes with poor pacing and a surprising lack of suspense."
2,Sub-par all the way,**SPOILERS**Apocalyptic tragedy spares the chosen kids but everyone else gets roasted by sun flares. Bizarre alien-like beings transport the chosen kids to a new planet and they run toward a magical glittering tree.That's the movie in a nutshell. It wasn't very exciting nor was it original. The acting was sub-par. The special effects were also below standard.
3,KNOWING,"Interesting and good for a great scifi thriller. Thought it was put together ok. Of course, you having Nicolas Cage as lead actor, it has to be a good film. He was very good in National Treasury. Good Film, I would rate this film a 3 or 3.5. Less language, more action. If they ""Hollywood"", would acknowledge the real truth about prophetic words and the Bible, this could of been rated a 4 or 5 or even higher in my opinion.. I think people should realize that we are living in our last days upon this earth and should know the real truth and gospel of Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. But, of course this is up to the individual if they want to know more about the prophetic words of the Holy Bible. The book of Truth, the best book to start with. The book of Revelation, has it all sbout the future. May God Bless each individual who reads this review."
5,"Suspense, Apocalyptic, Sci-Fi, Dramatic Thriller","Another one of Nicolas Cage's best works because it has Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic story line, prophecy, end times, numerology puzzles, mysticism, eschatology, and end of the world type stuff to keep the viewer in suspense and on the edge of your seat. I would watch this movie over and over again."
3,"Good Beginning, then Slow Moving, then Unsatisfying Ending","This moving starts off good and interesting, but then slows down and becomes hard to hold your interest. Then gets better near the end, but when it finally ends it leaves too many questions unanswered and is very unsatisfying. I like a movie that has some finality and closure to it. This has neither."
4,Better than I thought.,"This movie really was better than I thought. I also agree that if you don't like Cage, then don't watch this movie. it's his typical acting as always. but the movie it's self was pretty cool and suspensful. This might be a renter for most people but I got a good price for it here on Amazon."
3,Cage,This movie had me on the edge of my seat!!!! Untill the Aliens ! Then I became dissappointed. The ending was cool. But should have left aliens out.
2,Ideas seem to be stolen from the Bible just not as interesting.,"I watched this movie without ""knowing"" anything about it. If you don't know anything about the Bible you may like the film. It was very predictable in that it steals ideas from the Bible, and twists them with SCI-FI wierdness. If I was going to see an end times movie this with themes close to the Bible I would rather have seen it be more factual. Maybee Nickolas could have done his finger thing from Gone in 60 seconds, at least then I would have laughed at it more. If you were going to steal ideas might as well be from your own work!"
5,drama/sci-fi,"It is a very good story keeps you intreasted , Nick Cage is one of my favoite actor . purchased the movie ,I like to watch a good movie more then once"
4,Worthy of resurection!,"This obscure work by Cherubini is a vocal masterpiece. It's beauty is enhanced by the fine performance of the Clarion Concerts Chorus and soloists under the direction of Newell Jenkins. If there are conductors looking for a spetcatular peice to program, listen to this recording and you will surely find it compelling to produce yourself. It is a clear, virtually untouched 'raw' performance of a work that has only been performed by three orchestras to date in the United States. The Missa Solemnis, in d minor is certainly worthy of adding to any music lovers library."
5,Excellent Bargain,An excellent set of knives for the price. Very nice wood case with high quality knives. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
5,I like them,Got a great price on a good knife set. The knife feels good in your hand they cut very well. The wood case is nice because you can leave it in a drawer and not worry about it.
2,ALWAYS THE SAME ...,"SHores ( and also his partner Brian Cull ) always write their fighting aviation books in the same style: boring day-by-day descriptions of squadron's activities, with no human inside or a pleasent style of writing. THis one here is no exception. The research is tremendous but the writing is ...."
5,George Dyer a Great Talent,"I came across George Dyer singing on an FM station about 3yrs ago. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. His renditions on this CD of some really well known religeous songs/hymns is wonderful and he has quite a very fresh approach to these songs. Some of my favourites on this CD are, How Great Thou art (you will not believe his interpretation of this song), Lord Make Me An Instrument & Father In Heaven (Ave Maria). They are all treated with the reverence & respect we have come to expect from this wonderful artist. This is once again is a very thought provoking album."
4,complex rules,"The rules on this are quite involved, but the theme is great and still well worth playing! I would recommend."
4,John Deere Country,My husband loves this series and so does my son. I got this for him for Father's Day and it arrived on time and in excellent condition. I would use the vedor again in the future.
3,Gift for husband,Will probably watch again this winter when snowy and cold outside. We are true JD farmers and he loves the old stuff.
3,Good for Older Kids,"This video was interesting to my husband, but it didn't hold my 2 1/2 year old's attention. It would be much better for older kids."
5,no one can eat just ten... or twenty,"Absolutely delicious and unique flavor-- unlike anything else. Everyone I know loves Swedish fish. :)Unique consistency, too. Not a gummy candy, but not overly chewy. Just a great candy!"
3,Cute but very small!,"I received this as a gift from my wish list. I collect coin banks and really like shamrocks--so this is a perfect gift for me--but it is too small to be used as a bank, nnless you only want to save a few dimes! It is cute!"
4,Love Ya June,"June goes through a nice set of old standards in her typical great style. Nice mix of small group and orchestral arrangements, bright and bouncy. June could make the best of any tune. If a Christy fan you will like this ""older"" stuff that sounds great without the benefit of today's tech advances."
3,bad night,"I was expecting much more.I eagerly anticpated its release.This appears to have been a very ""off"" night for leslie.I was expecting a performance equal to the Live CD released a few years ago. Its phenominal. Why wasnt somebody videoing that night?The trick video camera angles I found here were annoying.The energy just wasnt there this night.For a West fanatic like me, still a must have.For newcomers to the genius and uniqueness that is Leslie West......by the live CD.Lets hope something better gets recorded and released soon."
2,"Mountain ""Mach Two""","This was a big disappointment. I wish I could believe that it was an off night, but it looks to me like they did not even rehearse for this gig. Spinal Tap's ""Free Form Jazz Odyssey"" sounded better than parts of this DVD. The transitions between the songs are sloppy and fumbling, West keeps fiddling with his settings on his guitar which he seemed to have problems with. This is probably a matter of taste, but I didn't like Richie Scarlett's bass playing on most of the set. The great Mountain comes off like a bar band not the great powerhouse that they once were.That being said, Leslie is in fine voice on the set and he can still scratch out some sparks. I wish he would go back to his signature sound though. He has mucked it up quite a bit.The real crime here is that the group put this thing out. It's a sub par product, that will probably only be watched once by Mountain fans (of which I am one). Have some respect for your fans and rehearse."
2,It's A Crying Shame,"Terrible, is best I can describe this. Corky does a good job, but West is sloppy. I could not finish watching it."
1,What happened to Leslie and Mountain???,"I was really looking forward to this DVD, but man, what a disappointment. I have seen Leslie about a dozen times through the 70's and he was one of my all time favorite guitarists. He got all kinds of sounds out of loads of wattage and minimal effects pedals. I loved the clean gut-wrenching cords and middle neck leads. Definitely the best as a live band. What happened??In Sea of Fire he's fiddling with all his effects through the whole show. He had a totally different sound than he used to. Every once in a while he would hit a cord that would make you flash back to an old show, but then I would snap out of it on his next cord or note when his digital delay crap kicked in. The show looks like it was taped in a Jr. High school gym with about 50 people in the audience. I have to agree, about the only good thing was some of the pictures of the Mountain of old. I would like to see the old footage/concerts on DVD."
2,Mountain DVD,"Leslie!!!!! Get rid of your octave divider & the rest of your effects!!!!! You had one of the best natural tones & vibrato in rock/blues!!!! Crank that Eddie Van Halen Peavey amp clean and lets hear your real magic!! Personally Freddy King smokes your ass, but you used to be number 2!!!! Get back to the real and give us all a thrill!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"Awww... I SO wanted this to be a worthy successor to another brand who changed their formula, but it's not doing it for me. I don't think the aroma is particularly bracing, it's a mere hint of mint (better,in my opinion than a flowery or fruity aroma)but no ""zing"". Also it does not lather well (and no...we do not have hard water). I'll keep looking for something that replaces my much beloved Kiss My Face Early to Rise (which no longer smells like much either)."
3,Almost perfect,"After receiving my body wash and tearing off the lovely wrapping paper and seal it was covered with, I discovered the pump didn't work. So I use my body wash in the shower without the pump and wonder why Archipelago doesn't spend their money on a pump that works instead of all that lovely wrapping paper!"
5,Fresh and clean,This is the one bath product I never run out of. I have used Morning Mint for over ten years and have never gotten tired of the fresh clean scent. My skin is sensitive and Archipelago products have never irritated my skin. This body wash lathers well and a little goes a long way.
3,"Comprehensive, but out of date","This book covers a lot of ground, but is out of date with the newest Netscape servers (just try and use SiteManager). I'd like to see a 2nd edition with less intro on Javascript and Java (I think there are over 200 other books that cover the same introductory material) and more in depth coverage of advanced Java, JavaScript, and server-side programming."
2,Not a good reference - disorganized,"This book fails to meet some standards for a reference it assumes to be. The source codes and examples are not in accordance, the book is full of useless examples and errors are abundant. Of course it is superior to ""Dummies..."", ""Idiots ..."" and similar books but I expected more."
2,Upside Down and Disorganized Overall,"This book is supposed to be a reference but since it suffers of many errors and tend to be overall confusing - for example it is trully unbelievable how the authors, writing such an exhaustive treatise, could not figure out better way to match source codes and topics. Some examples really make no practical sense at all, other are unclear or unprecise, the reference is incomplete or mistaken and in general it is hard to count on the book as a guide. I believe the second edition is badly needed to improve the style and clarity of the first."
5,Interesting. A refreshing change from the norm.,"I learned something (well a lot of somethings) from reading this book which is definitely a welcome change. Never the less I don't agree with all the praise for this book. To me the book is a practical handson guide to learning JavaScript, LiveWire, Netscape IFC, PlugIn Programming and LiveConnect. I liked it for its practicality and applicability to my development efforts."
5,My favorite Stanek book!,I picked up this book back in May. I've read it cover to cover many times since. Wonderful! I wish more books had this many insights..
3,Good overall but weak in javascript syntax,"My 3 stars might be a little low for a review of this book - Its a good reference for everything Netscape. Having bought the book for Javascripting help, I was a bit dissappointed with its handling of syntax. The Javascript object model provides a logical way to access most any element within an HTML page but the Netscape ONE book failes to specifically cover the object hierarchy syntax. Events and Methods are listed but very few of them are fully described with examples. Also, although some thought was given to cross-platform compatibility, there are some glaring problems that don't seem have solutions. One such problem involves Netscape's method for checking if windows are open and giving them the focus if they are instead of attempting to open a new window. While this works in Netscape, it does not in Internet Explorer - a fact not touched on"
4,Comprehencive Book,"Very good book, interesting history review of the past, but a little bit PROPAGANDA sounding end, anyway, the excellent source for those who is interested in Estonian history."
5,A Must Have!,"This book does exactly what it promises to on the cover - get double the work done in half the time. Its been my constant resource since it arrived at my doorstep and I look at it every day. The chapter on working faster in Camera Raw alone has saved me hours! If you're at that point in your Photoshop career where you need to start working smarter, not harder then add this one to your shopping list."
5,Toestomper Rules!,"My 3 year old ""discovered"" this book after I heard about it on NPR. After previewing it at the library it was at the top of his Christmas list. Ever since, we read it daily with him demanding that I ""do the voices"". For parents who like to dramatize their readings, this book is a treasure. Colorful characters and excellent illustrations bring a funny tale of a tough guy who finds his soft side and learns to be a friend to smaller animals. Others may question the look and attitude of Toestomper and his cohorts, but I judge books by the reaction of my child. We've read it at least 50 times and so far the only change in his behaviour I've seen is that when he sees smaller children or little animals he says ""We should be nice to them...like Toestomper."""
4,Pay no attention to that ranter behind the curtain!,"I read this one to my approaching-40 husband, the closest I come to a child. He thought it was fun. Asked for a message, he came up with: ""It's okay to change. It's okay to stand up for the people you love."" It seems to me that getting into questionable situations is how you learn/teach your children to make good choices. Pay no attention to the ranter behind the curtain.The illustrations are very expressive too."
1,Disgusted at the lessons being taught young readers,"This book is a fake. It purports to teach that compassion is all, but the compassion the ""Hero""(?) demonstrates serves merely to advance his position as head of a gang. Those saved are taught to cheat and the ending is that now that they know how to cheat, they always win. Is this what we want our children to learn? If so, why are we surprised when they act this way?"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I have owned a similar product by the same company in the past. I had that for years and it worked great. After I got it wet trying to clean it and ruined the motor, I purchased this model. I hadn't even had it a month before it started giving me problems. It just doesn't have the power to push the litter chunks into the bin. I know I am using the proper clumping litter as recommended by the company. At this point I have turned it off and it just acts as a very expensive regular litter box. I really wish I had paid attention to reviews!"
1,BAD UNIT,"Have had this for about a year now and twice the rake roller has broken!!It took LiterMaid 2 months to get me a replacment rake, and now after about 5 more months, it has broken again. If you are thinking if LitterMaid, buy only the LM950 model. Had one for 5 years, before it wore out from use. Best unit LitterMaid ever made!!"
2,Who still spends more time cleaning the litter - me of course,"Some days it seems to work fine and others it doesn't, it never sweeps once but 3 or 4 times which gets extremely annoying. There is always litter spilling out of the sides when the comb reaches the receptical. It gets everywhere. The tent after only 3 months is splitting, I need a replacement, can't do without it otherwise we would have litter all the way down the hall way. Not good, needs lots of refining and cleaning the litter box, what a rotten job that is, tried doing this in the sink and resorted to using the bath, at least the bath is easy to clean afterwards."
2,Requires Extra Effort,"While the litter maid is large and looks capable of handling the ""mess"". We still have to clear clumps that stick to the bottom, otherwise the unit just keeps trying to run over and over to do what it can't."
1,Broken in three weeks,"I purchased a Litter Maid self-cleaning box just over three weeks ago. For two weeks I hailed it as the best product ever made. However, I did notice it had trouble once in a while continually raking. My cat always utilized one side and pushed most of the litter to that side (that's what cats do). I purposely filled it well below the fill line and this seemed to help. The problem is the self-cleaning system does not appear to recover when the cat pushes most of the litter to one side, because of a design flaw. The system continually rakes back and forth, never able to reset, instead of passing over to recover and re-raking. Thus, in three short weeks the system has already broken; the motor continues but the rod and wheels do not. Worse off, the rack was stuck in the middle of the box, motor running, leaving my cat no where to go, expect on the floor next to it."
1,Unhappy Cats,"We have been using a LitterMaid cat box for over 3 years. Our first box was a differnt design: larger litter area, plastic rake, and no timer/clock. It worked great; we had no issues at all but the motor finally gave out after 3 years of service for our 2 cats.We replaced it with this newer model and have had nothing but trouble since. It constantly jams, collects small pices of waste behind the rake, and the plastic waste container gets snagged by the rake on a regular basis causing the unit to stall. Also, if the power goes out or even flickers, the unit turns off. If we are traveling when the box turns off, it fills quickly due to the smaller box design and the cats begin to leave little surprises outside the box.Our cats became use to a clean box and now they are very unhappy. Me too! I encourage you to pass on this model: The LitterMaid Elite Mega Automatic Litter Box."
4,Still working great!,"I bought one of these several years ago. It worked great then and it's still working great now. And I've done precious little maintenance on it.But pass on the tent, it's a waste and neither of my cats ever liked it. I'd be happier if they sold a hard plastic cover for it instead.Here's a suggestion, get a boot tray and put it under the box. I did this a while ago and it's great. It keeps any accidents or spilled litter from getting onto the floor. I had an older cat that seemed to ""miss"" the box now and then. The tray kept the problem from ruining the floor."
3,Pricey,"Cons-it takes a huge amount of space, it makes noise. If the cat prefers one side of the box, the litter bin will fill up quickly and not close. The rake will sometimes make little pieces out of the clumps. That all said, I would buy it again because it keeps the box always clean if we are away or if I 'forget' to clear the box for a day or so. Cheaper than boarding for the cat and it made our cat happier with her indoor situation because her space is always clean. To the manufacturer-I wish it had a solid cover instead of the tent. I wish the holding area were larger and the side walls thinner. The bags to use in the holding box are a great idea."
1,needs many logistical improvements,"I was quite disappointed w/ this LitterMaid purchase. I had had the Litter Maid Plus....that was a bit smaller, (didn't have to assemble it) for 2yrs and loved it. With all the fancy adjectives, i was sucked into thinking it was larger and more effecient. Wrong....lots of chinks. Unfortunately i had already disposed of my old one. I should have returned this thing......but i kept thinking, surely this will get better if i have the right litter....or i do this or do that....wrong. I do not recommend this product! I am a cat lover w/ 2 himmi's."
1,Broke Immediately Poor Warranty Support!!! Don't Buy,"I have two cats, so I thought this would be a great timesaver. Instead, it is a very expensive non-operational litterbox. The rake broke off within one week of purchase. I called littermaid to request another. It was backordered. After a month of not receiving it, (and scooping poop), I called back to be told it was still backordered, and I should just keep calling until they have it.Cheap plastic. Company won't repair or replace parts."
2,did not work very well,"the product did not work that well, it tried but didnt do its duty, i ended up scooping after it didnt work every time, i gave it a few days but didnt work as i expected"
2,Eh,It is nice not to have to scoop all the time but this thing ends up cutting the things into little pieces that it can't push into the bin and so you still have to scoop all the time. Also the litter from the box gets everywhere. Totally NOT worth the money.
1,So NOT worth the money,"I have had my LitterMaid Elite for about 2 or 3 months now and it has never worked right. It gets stuck even when there is barely anything there and the roller on the rake has already busted off and now I have to use it like its a regular manual litter box (a manual litter box that cost me $170.00)! I read up on this and there are 100s of complaints about the same thing happening to MANY MANY people. Plus, half of the litter falls all over the floor and even under the box and when you go to clean it out you have to touch way more yucky stuff than if you where to just use a scoop and a regular every day litter box. The LitterMaid company also does not offer replacement parts so when something does brake, good luck! You have another useless thing in your home!"
4,"Good tuna (not the best, but good) and a great value","This is not the best canned tuna I've had--that is sold by Ortiz and is more expensive. I save that for special dishes. This is what I use for tuna salad. It is good, comparable to Cento tuna, and far superior to anything I can buy in my small-town grocery stores. The 6-oz. can is a nice size and the pack of 24 cans is a superb value."
1,Tuna is critically endangered species now :(,"DO NOT BUY THIS! SAVE THE TUNA.We are scooping fish out of the oceans at such a diminishing rate, there will be oceans with no fish in 30 yrs timeAct now, it's now or never."
3,Oil packed tuna,"Fantastic delicate flavor, great in tomato pasta sauce...or on Italian bread directly from the can with American cheese.. Delicious!!!! In Antipasta it adds such a flavor to the meats and cheeses already there..."
4,Overall pretty good film.,This movie didn't receive much promotion so going into it I didn't know really what to expect. While watching this movie I laughed more than a few times and think if you give it a chance and are not easily offended you will too. Watch this movie and give it a chance and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Seann William Scott is a great actor and this movie once again shows his incredible comedy skills and the rest of the cast is great also. I was entertained the entire length of this movie and think it would also be good for multiple views. Something to watch with friends and get a good laugh or perhaps a few.
4,Pretty Funny!!!,"This was a very funny movie about a janitor named Gary Houseman who helps coach a Tennis team who haven't won a game in a long time. Gary has very funny and unorthodox ways of helping his team. There were some hilarious secondary characters like the laughing grandpa, and the 8-year-old named Amy who is pregnant and needs money for an abortion. Will Gary lead the team to victory? I highly recommend BALLS OUT: GARY THE TENNIS COACH!!!"
3,Funny Enough,"If you liked Stiffler in American Pie, you'll like this. It's funny, but not hard to see why it didn't make it to the big screen."
2,Sean William Scott is so good.....,but this movie is bad.Acting - goodPlot - clichédScript - horrid
1,Awful waste of time,"While browsing through the video store for a comedy, I ran account this and thought sean williams scott & the direct of Harold & Kumar...MUST be hilarious. Well was I horribly mistaken.There was only one part in the entire hour and a half that made me laugh out loud. Such a disappointment, not shocking we never heard of it before."
1,Nothing funny about children being abused,"I am not a prude, but how Ryan Simpkins, a then 9 year old actress playing a 8 year old child, was treated by adults involved in the movie, including her parents, is morally off the charts. The lines she has to say are initially shocking to garner some bad taste humor and it just gets worse. A scene where she comments on the dogs in the movie ""we went dry hump daddy"" while wiping her face was the most terrible thing I have seen in a movie. All involved including her parents should be under investigation for child abuse."
3,Decent but not great,"Typical stupid comedy. If you are expecting a diamond in the rough you are looking in the wrong place. If you want a movie to pass the time, then this could be a choice."
1,Horrible,Whoever made this series should never be allowed to make children television again. Avoid at all cost.

3,Underrated liitle gem,"i could watch Steve McQueen in anything but this is an underrated little gem. Also, the directing was wonderful. Loved the score."
4,McQueen at his best...,"if you watch Steve McQueen's performance in this piece you will see what true ability he had. the nevada smith character is out for revenge and nothing more. he is cold and calculating and will not stop until he is sated. you can actually feel the underlying rage of the character. karl malden, nose and all, has a stellar performance as the baddie....great film...highly recommended...."
5,A young McQueen at his best!,This is an engaging Western with high emotions and finally a lesson in revenge. Hey I bought this movie! It is in my amazon cloud and downloads frequently into my Fire to be viewed again. Strap on your gunbelt and meet Nevada Smith!
5,ULTRA QUALITY MOVIE TIME,"it is a must see.one of the best,most overlooked westerns of all times.the cast alone, speaks for itself."
1,Not so good.,"You're supposed to believe that Steve McQueen is a ""kid"", because everyone keeps calling him one. This is despite the fact he's in his mid 30's. In order to provide more cover for this blatantly obvious problem, McQueen acts like a stupid kid. That way we'll believe he's young and naive, right? No, he just acts and sounds like an idiot. I don't get this one."
5,A Unilateral Cowboy,"Three terrorists torture and murder a young man's parents. The young man then behaves like a cowboy, unilaterally determining to kill the terrorists and erase them from the world as a threat to anyone else (in addition to punishing them for their evil deed). The cowboy does not seek to form any sort of coalition. He does not consult the United Nations. He does not ask, ""Why did they hate my parents?"" He does not appear to know anything about the concepts of tolerance, diversity, inclusion and compassion. There was never any mention of passing resolutions or sending inspectors. He merely rids the world of the terrorists (except for the last one, who just wasn't worth it). By the end of the story, these are certainly three terrorists who will never again terrorize anyone. Now, what sort of message does this send, regarding the best way to deal with terrorist/killers?"
1,Oh dear - this was bad,OK - I was wondering why I'd never seen this movie as it had such a high rating. It was impossible to get through more than the 1st 20 mins as the acting was so unnatural. It reminded me more of silent film stylized acting. I'm a bit stunned that every raves about SM's performance when it is horribly stilted and crude. I really struggle to understand the reviews based on the the acting.
2,Nevada Snooze,"Hard to believe there was ever a fuss made over this film. I kept waiting for some great dramatic moment but it never came. Steve is wasted in this flic, barely making an impact despite his iconic status. This dvd was a waste of money, best just rent it."
4,Breakout Performance from Steve McQueen,"I had just watched this film on TCM before Amazon offered the movie for sale. ""Nevada Smith"" is a minor character featured in the book and movie, ""THe Carpetbaggers"". McQueen really is compelling to watch in this revenge Western. I found the movie very entertaining ."
5,Great to read aloud!,"Teachers and parents - here is a great book to read aloud to your kids. I have read it to my 3rd graders 2 years in a row and will read it to my 5th grade this year. Its a great adventure and holds their attention, as well as teaching about some local native american traditions. The 2 main characters get into a couple of interesting situations, leading up to the big camp-out and the accident. They figure out how to help each other and how to be friends. The kids loved it and I love it too. Teachers - works great with Native American Units or as adventure literature."
4,Spirit Quest,"There are not many books about Washington state that I can use to connect Social Studies and Literacy. This isn't a great story, but it's realistic and helps my students understand Native American culture somewhat. The books were in very good condition and arrived quickly from the seller."
2,It'll do.,"It works, but I'm a bit concerned about the noise it makes. You pulg it into the wall and it sounds like a thousand little beads are rolling around inside. The noise stops when you hook it up to the phone. The prongs seem to be almost too wide for my v8300.Point: It does its job, but I don't use it as a primary source for phone charging."
4,Best fit for your car,This mug is the best mug I got. It has a design which fit my honda's cup holder. And it keeps my coffee really hot and keep me awake for my daily long commute. I highly recommend this product to all LA commuter.
2,UNFORTUNATELY MISTITLED,"The title is misleading, probably deliberately. This book isn't about Hitler's attempts to sabotage America during WW2. While that topic takes up about one-fifth of the book, that topic is only used to introduce us to the topic of how enemy combatants are treated in the war of terror.If that's what the author really wants to write about, that's what he should write about instead of pretending he's writing about Hitler's pathetic attempt to sabotage America in 1942."
1,Title is a Subterfuge,"The book was presumably written solely for the purpose of attacking the Bush Presidency, rather than advancing our knowledge of a WWII event. While struggling to stay on his subject initially, he soon switches to his real reason for writing it......to attack President Bush. His choice of the flaming ""liberal"" Anthony Lewis to introduce his book is evidence enough as his true purpose.There are other true historical accounts of the German landing in New York and Florida if readers are looking for an historical perspective. They won't find it in this untruthfully entitled book."
4,Pretty Decent Set for the Money!,"While these knives are not as good quality as the Henckels Pro-S knives my husband uses at his restaurant, the Sabatier Copper Balance is a good set for the price I paid. I actually bought a second set as a Christmas gift for my parents and they love them!"
4,Great value for the price.,"The value for price was good, but I still use myHenckels 4* more - this was just to have the extraknives and steak knives, which are great for dinners.And the block alone is worth all the moneyAs starter set it is unbeatable - is is good set of knives toget used to good knives."
2,I love the Gold Box! But I hate these knives!,"I've modified my original comments. Anything in [] below is what I think after having the knives for 4+ months.I got these knives for 30 dollars SHIPPED, and [I thought] it was a GREAT deal.The knives are VERY solid, and feel very sturdy. They didn't come as sharp as they could have been, but it did come with a nice sharpener, which did the trick.[This is NOT an] Excellent set of knives, even for the normal price of 60 bucks.[Over the past 4 months, they have rusted to the point where they are almost unuseable. AVOID THESE KNIVES, and don't be fooled by a cheap price into thinking they're worth the money.]"
5,"The book to have, just don't buy it here...","This book is a definite 'must-have' for anyone who wants to undertake the study of quantitative genetics. However, I would not purchase it from Amazon again.I paid $110.00 for the book as 'new,' and it arrived so beat up looking that I had to double check my order to make sure I hadn't purchased it as 'used.' Every corner is dented and worn looking, the finish on the cover is scratched and cracked, and some of the pages are scuffed and stained. I really need this book right now, so I'm keeping it - but I definitely feel I got ripped off with this purchase."
4,"Good Book, Pretty Old At This Point","It's a good intermediate book, and the 150 or so solved problems are very useful.Although it is ""Quantitative Genetics,"" there isn't any statistical genetics in here, which is pretty odd. Just a passing mention of things like chi square testing of the null hypothesis would be helpful. Maybe it's because this book was first published in 1960 and the 4th edition came out in 1996.I happen to have the 1960 edition, and parts of it are unchanged. I compared the 1960 version to the 4th edition where the new one awkwardly referred to a recessive allele as a ""gene."" Well, that page had not been revised since 1960! A little editorial housekeeping would go a long way.It's hard to give 5 stars to a $115 paperback that will end up in a zip lock bag with the pages falling out. And it's pretty thick at 450 pages, so the spine will definitely crack over time if you use it very much. Although I like the content, when I opened the box it was like getting socks at Christmas."
5,A book that you must have,"Basic concepts of population genetics and quantitative analysis, the authors show you how the concepts are created and connected, very good examples and exercises."
5,Quantitative fish,"This is an excellent book, that content the basic of the quantitative genetic and provide a comprehensive interpretation of the genetic action and interaction. Its price give the possibility the student having his own copy to introduce to a simple and deep view of the quantitative genetic."
3,Dissapointed just by Playlist,"The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because with or without this CD, gospel is wonderful. Otherwise it would be a zero.My questions are, where is Byron Cage's ""Presence of the Lord""?Why did they put Kirk Franklin's old ""Brighter Day"" song on there? ""Presence of the Lord"" could have been there opening song.Alot of the other artists were old timers... Shirley Caesar, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Beverly Crawford, and Lee Williams & the Spiritual QCs. And most of them aren't really my favorites.Who in WORLD are TonHx (or do they mean Tonex?), Joann Rosario, Lamar Campbell & Spirit Of Praise, Ted & Sheri, Harvey Watkins, Jr.(feat. Doug & Melvin Williams), and 7 Sons Of Soul? Truthfully, I've never heard of either of them, not even on BET's Lift Every Voice.Now I see why none of my family members have this CD. WOW! Gospel 2003 was much better. Save your bucks!"
5,Great!!,"Well, where to start....Hmmm....OK, this is easy. Any Dr. Who with Tom Baker is simply great! His series saw some of the best script writing and stage play that any TV series could ever hope for (exception being Babylon 5 and remake of Battlestar Galactica). Special effects are horrible, which is great because if forces you to follow the story line and not get overwhelmed by the ""bling"" of the scene. Also, it promotes a healthy use of imagination as your mind fills in the gaps left by the low budget effects.I loved the Tom Baker years as a kid (had to hang aluminum foil on the rabbit ears to pull in the PBS station that aired them), and I find that this series still has the same effect now without all the hassel. :)"
4,Better With The CGI Enhancements,"The Invasion of Time has always been one of my favorite Doctor Who stories. Unfortunately, the nasty special effects that were created for the Vardans really ruined the story for me. (Well, maybe the clumsy Sontaran trying to leap over the chaise lounge chair was pretty lame too.)However, thanks to the advent of CGI technology, the viewer is able to replace some of the bad special effects. This helps the story immensely.I recommend this story for the tried and true Doctor Who fan."
5,Notes Alive Dr. Seuss's My Many Colored Days,I rented this from our local library and found in one week both my children wanting this video over all our other favorites. It highlights the wonderful book by Seuss but also presents the Minnesota orchrestra. The music in this is so wonderfully done and Holly Hunter's narration is perfect. This truly brings to life the different moods color can play in our lives. There is additional footage on the making of the video and a look at the author seen in the eyes of his wife. Enjoyable for the entire family. My 2.5 year daughter has been reciting lines from this story. It has been so much fun and I just had to buy a copy!
5,A fantastic and captivating movie for all ages,"The quick and at times slow pace of the music and animation grabs, and holds the attention of even very active children unlike anything I have ever seen. The vast array of emotions expressed and portrayed by the boy illustrates reality. It shows children that it is OK to not have ""pink days"" 24-7. The interactive games teach about the animation, music and instruments used in the production and promotes interest in these topics in all ages. The games also promote excellent observation and comprehension skills. It will be a family favorite."
5,Five-Stars Doesn't Begin To Do It Justice,"I think I love this video as much as does any child who has ever seen it. It is just wonderful! Taking Dr. Seuss's last completed book, My Many Colored Days, and making it into a short three-dimensional movie with colors that leap with absolute beauty was a stroke of genius. And I love the music that accompanies it, too! Holly Hunter is a perfect choice for narrator. This video is a rare example of how magical a project can be when everything is gotten just exactly right! No matter how many times I watch it, this video still reaches something in me and makes me happy."
2,Unfortunate portrayal of the book,"Like other concerned parents, we own only a handful of videos for my daughter. I bought this one specifically because I think very highly of the book of the same name. I am a musician, and I was drawn to the use of a real (not synthesized) orchestra. The original classical music is wonderful! However, the animation and overall ""look"" of the video is quite disappointing. It bears no relation to the beautiful illustrations in the book (other than the colors!), and has a very ""computerized"" look to it. I find the face of the boy to be harsh and expressionless, and there is nothing about the animated characters that is warm or appealing. The art in the book is an integral part of its appeal, so it is unfortunate that the art in the video does not do it justice."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is scary the kid is always smiling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Except when he is lost on purple days! i would buy this movie just to make fun of it. Suess would be ashamed
3,Lint Magnet,"This shirt fits well and is comfortable, but it is a magnet for lint and animal hair; if you have animals that shed, I would reconsider."
2,Needlessly Interactive,"This is basically just a book of terms you have to click on constantly. In that respect it is a very poor use of technology. There are some topics in here you may wish to learn about but they are presented like a series of definitions with no narration or literary flow at all. There is nothing to entice you to seek out the next chapter. Then you have to click on the pictures to see the illustrations of what they are talking about. People today are also fond of multitasking, Click away from this CD and the program closes. I quickly tired of it."
1,What was I thinking?,"The book started out with good, clear descriptions of Indian Sacred Literature; and fooled me into thinking this was worth reading... then things started to get flakey. If you like UFO's, New Age Spiritualism, and Grand Cosmological Conspiracy Theories you may like this book. If you are interested in the actual culture, history and relgion of India you won't find it here."
4,I find this album seriously wonderful.,"""Seriously wonderful?"" Well, yes; the album is both. Recorded long before the current flood of ""mystic"" albums, the music is both soothing & stimulating, & ideal for a meditative state. The long surge of the developing melodies seem to echo the flow of an unspoiled, archaic landscape.I had heard and enjoyed ""Tubular Bells,"" but it was ""Hergest Ridge"" that turned me into an Oldfield fan."
4,As good as tubular bells.,"Like most people, the only Mike Oldfield album I knew of was the one from which they lifted the theme for The Exorcist. But then in 1987 I was sharing a place with this Chemistry major in Santa Cruz who turned out to be crazy, BUT, he had a huge collection of music. I heard him playing this album, and got an immediate rush. Tubular Bells, but different. If you loved Tubular Bells, get this one too. I highly recommend it."
4,Green Bay Packers Fun Pack,"Buttons were a little smaller than I thought, but still satisfied. Priced right. They added a liitle something fun to our superbowl game party hats. Yeah for the Packers!!!"
1,Ummm... full screen?,"Let me check, what year is this. Oh yeah, its 2008! Why in heaven is this not offered in Widescreen format? What were these people thinking? Im def not going to get this unless it comes out in widescreen. Just another example of a bad decision by execs who are not in touch with the customer."
4,Quick coverage of condensed matter,"This is another Dover publication, for the student on a budget. It was first published in 1967, and has not been updated since. But its material is correct. Discoveries in physics since 1967 have not refuted the analysis here.It is an easy introduction to theoretical condensed matter physics. Subjects like second quantisation, superconductivity and superfluidity are explained. If you have read Kittel's book on solid state physics, that is adequate preparation for this.Understand, though, that the superconductivity described here is that of BCS; the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. The standard model. It does not treat the high temperature superconductors, as those hail from 1987 onwards. But that field is in tremendous flux [pun intended] and if you are interested in that, seek out a text devoted to it."
1,Hollywood Goes To War 18 dvd set,"I bought this dvd set from Costco and had it several months before I opened it. To my surprise, all the dvd's in the set do not work on my dvd player. The information and tag for the company issuing the dvd set is there but nothing else. I also noticed in looking through the dvd set is one has to do with ""December 7, 1943 which documents the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor was bombed in December 7, 1941. I wonder who collected these videos and now I am hoping that Costco can look up this sale and refund my purchase price. I am a WW2 fan and would have loved to seen this set of WW2 videos. I have a Sony BluRay player and this dvd set should have played on it and I also tried it on my computer. There are just no movies on the discs."
5,Another page turner.,Gilbert Morris continues to keep the Winslow family encountering all kinds of this life's problems and always gets them through them. Very interesting.
1,Poor Quality Video. Not worth purchasing.,"I recently purchased this item from Sharper Image and was very disappointed.The video is faint, grainy (even in strong lighting), and out of focus once you are more than 2 feet away from the camera. Colors all but disappear. It's practically black-and-white video.The power supply weighs more than the device itself (one pound, including cord) and is HUGE. It also gets very warm after an hour or so.I've tested this product in every type of lighting situation and the results have been unsatisfactory in all cases. The only thing the device does well is detect motion."
5,Simple and they work,"I have used these on a 1992 LS400 and on a 1992 Corvette and now ona 2006 MB E320. They are an extremely simple device (a thin aluminum dish with some slits cut in it) and they work. They really should cost about $20 a pair for what they are, but there is no competition, so Kleen Wheels can gouge and charge up to double that. Amazon has the best price. Some claim that they cut down on brake performance because they restrict cooling, but I haave never found that to be true. Maybe on a race track there might be an effect, but not in normal driving. They keep brake dust off your wheels and their finish lasts longer and they stay clean, as a result. Only negative is that if you have cool-looking brakes like Brembos, you can't see them."
2,"Great idea, bad product.","Do not buy this sink. I bought this sink for the room it provides. It is large and deep and I can wash almost anything easily in it. Within months though, the bottom looked terrible despite our efforts to follow all maker recommendations for care. Within a year the white finish was completely worn away in places leaving black areas showing through. The best I have gotten from American Standard is that they will give me $100 credit toward another of their sinks."
1,Americast fails,"I've had this kitchen sink for a few years and consider the surface a complete failure. Within a couple of months of installation, scratches appeared and the surface stains easily and is very difficult to clean. If you follow American Standard's instructions of using nothing stronger than Bon Ami cleanser, you'll waste a lot of time to no avail. I finally gave up and went back to Bar Keeper's Friend, which does work. Americast may work for a bathroom sink, which gets little use. But it is a total failure for any ""working"" sink and the list of complaints about it on the Internet supoort that. Avoid it."
3,"Pretty, but...","This ring is very pretty, but the silver setting over-powers the stones. They aren't as bright & noticeable as in the picture. I did order a different ring from the Eves Addiction and I am very happy with it."
1,Don't do it,"I purchased this ring directly from Eve's Addiction. To begin with, the stones are a dull translucent almost periwinkle, but not really pretty. I wore this ring 3 days and a stone popped out. I've bought a few other things from Eve's Addiction that I'm very happy with, but not this. It's definitely going back. I'm not bothering with doing an exchange. I wanted it to have the bright teal stones. All in all, a big flop."
4,JAN MARSHALL SHOWS LIFE IS REALLY FUNNY!,"STILL HANGING IN THERE is the perfect title for this book because it is about hanging in there through all the tribulations in everyday things. If you have ever been in a relationshhip or had kids or attempted to lose weight or wanted to take charge of your life or couldn't find your keys or anything big or small in your daily living, this is the book to read. It is very funny and I enjoyed it and would recommend it."
1,Not universal,"Claims to be universal but isn't.Does not fit a Ford Focus... not even close. Poorly designed product.Requires you to fit a sticky pad to the pedal and the new pads and bend, yes, bend, some 'brackets' to hold it to the pedal.Simply put... poorly designed (brackets) not universal, either. Look elsewhere or check locally if these will fit your vehicle."
1,Cheaply made pedals that loosen under normal driving conditions,"The brackets provided would barely grab on the very edges of the stock clutch and brake pedals of my 1999 Chevrolet S10.I installed as per the provided instructions, but every other day or so I would have to tighten the screws because the hardware would loosen and the pedal pads would begin to rotate.After repeating this for over a month, I got sick of having to constantly tighten the screws. I removed the pedal pads and put the stock ones back on. They are useless to me now."
4,Pedals,"wasn't disappointed but wasn't extremely impressed either. the pads are nice considering what the price is my only critique is the installation L screws are to short for most pedals especially if you put the sticky pads that are included to bond the old pedals to the new ones, took me about 5 minutes to open and install, I would recommend this if for the budget consciences."
2,"Well Made, Except for the Sound","I've really grown to hate this radio. It has all the features I want, it is solidly built, it looks great. But the bass level is cranked up to the point where it distorts the music. And, no, there is no equalization or bass/treble controls. So, if you want *all* of your music to go thump-thump-thump, it's a well-made shelf stereo. But if you want to listen to music the way it was originally recorded and performed, this thing will drive you nuts."
2,It'll get you by.,I didn't like the flow of the book. I found it hard to read and to keep my interest. Glad I sold it back. This book just skims the surface of the subject. I'm grateful to have an excellent instructor on the subject. She makes it interesting.
3,bleh,"like some other people my spray was GREEN but it actually didn't turn my skin green. i don't notice any tan at all actually after my first application, and i've waited 24 hours for it to appear. this thing isn't that great. won't re purchase but won't return it either."
1,you get what you pay for,"At first when I used this product I LOVED it. It does give a great color and is super easy to use. HOWEVER, when I ran out of the first cartridge and purchased another one(from sally's),the results were totally different. Suddenly the spray was drippy streaky and cheeto orange. I have absolutlely no idea how the same product with the exact same packaging can be so different. Each cartridge I purchased after that was never even as close to the firsts quality. I ended up just buying the air flow air glow gun and using ocean brand sunless tanner with it. This is a far better product with consistant results."
1,Be aware who you buy this from!!!,"i bought the airbrush gun and two cartridges from ""deals2thedoor"" and a refill cartridge from ""sally's beauty supply"". The plastic container from ""deals2thedoor"" that held the gun and two cartridges arrived slightly open, exposing the two cartridges and the when I went to use the cartridges from 'deals2thedoor"" the tanner came out bright GREEN, dying my skin a bright green, kinda like a frog. so i checked the refill from ""sally's"" hoping it was supposed to be green...NOPE the refill from ""sally's"" was a great bronze/brown color, which gave my skin the color i wanted....after that is, i had to jump in the shower and roughly scrub off the BRIGHT GREEN color. Needless to say don't buy products from ""deals2thedoor"", who know what color they will give you, stick with ""sally's beauty supply"" they now what their doing, they get 5 stars!"
1,Salon Bronze isn't worth the money,I purchased this for my daughter to use and it is NOT worth $1.99 let alone $19.99. Not only was the color uneven as it came out but the gun dripped horribly if you didn't keep it completely upright. If you get too close to the skin it comes out really dark and if you aren't close enough it comes out with splotchy spray marks. HORRIBLE!!!! We finally just sprayed the product on make-up wedges and sponged it on. Even then it was too dark in spots and too light in other. The self-tanning products that are lotions are a much better buy and cheaper to boot!
1,I dont know why anyone would purchase this...,"completely disappointed the tanning cartridge was either replaced or incorrect to begin with , before i received it. i turned lime green .. because it sprays lime green.despite the picture, you do not get 2 tanning cartridges only 1 . the facial applicators are triangle make-up sponges . the gun is generic plastic and you dont even need it honestly.I would strongly suggest buying sally hansens spray tans ."
4,Great product for the price,"It's o much better than lotion!!!! I've been using lotions and going to tanning beds for a while, I decided to try this just because it was on sale and it turned out to be great!!! YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS to get expected results... and everytime you apply it you get better at it. I like to apply it right after a shower (use lotion before applying). Great natural color, dries quick, no weird smell, doesn't turn pamls orange, doesn't tranfer to clothes"
3,YOU PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE TURNING GREEN. UR BUYING FAKE PRODUCTS ONLINE,"If you're going to buy Salon Bronze buy it from Sally's Beauty Supply in your local area. That's where I've always bought mine. It has never been green LOL You're buying fake products for way more money. The system is only 11.00 and some change at Sallys. The cartridges are 9 something. This stuff is good for the price but the catridges do run out very fast,the tan doesn't last long,and it is very messy. Will have your floors and walls dark brown and nasty. And your feet will be super brown and ew on the bottom. But for a quick cheap tan it is ok"
4,Pretty good!,"Well I just bought this self tanner at Sally's Beauty Supply and I must say, I was a little skeptical but it turned nice and brinze. I'm not sure what you people are talking about a green product, are you buying it from eBay or something?? Quit trying to save a buck and go to Sally's! It can be a little messy so follow directions as states, make sure to moisturizer elbows, knees, and feet..I use Vaseline to keep from getting to dark in those areas. But the color is pretty nice! Would definitely recommend!"
2,Wüsthof Gourmet 8-Inch Flexible Fillet Knife,"I have a number of forged Wusthof knives, and I love them. Until I ordered this knife, I did not know that Wusthof had a line of relatively ..., stamped knives. The difference in quality between this knive and my forged Wusthof knives is significant. I must add, however, that the superior forged knives have prices to match. A forged Wusthof fillet knife would be three times the price."
5,The Inside Scoop,"In this insightful and yeomanly researched book, Karen Donovan paints a vivid picture of a man who has achieved iconic status among America's trial lawyers. Thanks to the access granted the author by David Boies, we get not only a ringside seat for some of the last decade's most high-profile trials, including, of course, the one that put the current occupant of the White House in office, but we're there for pre-trial strategy sessions and post-trial dinners as well. Throughout, Donovan maintains a keen-eyed objectivity and isn't afraid to deflate balloons of bravado when need be. All in all, it's a compelling read."
5,Engrossing Read,"It is hard to believe that a profile of one of America's top lawyers could be so engrossing, but Karen Donovan has written a superb book on David Boies. This biography of Boies reads like a novel and really gives one a window into his life and approach to the law. I found it to be, as one reviewer put it, ""unputdownable."" I highly recommend this book for lawyers and non-lawyers alike!"
2,Poor Audio,"The reason I buy concert DVDs is for the sound quality of 5.1 surround. The sound quality of this DVD is sub par. Way sub par! The only reason that I give it two stars is because it has decent video of the original lineup of Black Sabbath with Tony Iommi in the center of the stage like it used to be. Otherwise, it is a waste."
2,Sounds like this show was recorded through a pillow,"I am a HUGE black sabbath fan, but this show is really disappointing. The sound quality is awful. It sounds like it was recorded over a cell phone or something. I can't believe that this is the best quality show existing from the time period. Why would they release such a poor quality recording? There have to be better ones in existence. This could have been remastered or something to make it sound better. I was excited when i first saw they had released this because I was itching for an uncut Black Sabbath concert. I suppose die-hard fans will have to check it out, but it may make you angry."
2,It's a shame....,"First of all, you'll be cheated by paying this much for a DVD with only 56 minutes and no extras. Second, I dont'know what they mean by ""1984"". This show is from 1978. Third, the record quality is awful, because this was translated from the VHS days, and it seems it suffered no digital remastering process.Anyway, it's the only official thing you can get of the legendary ""Sabbath / Osbourne"" line-up."
1,Bad Sound,The sound on this Sabbath DVD has not been remastered. I would recomend looking for another DVD. Very poor sound
1,Why people think that this DVD is good?????,"This Black Sabbath's dvd SUCK'S!!!!!!!!!!!The audio is TERRIBLE!!! you can almost hear the songs because of the annoying bass of the autohorns, (to much bass!! you can't hear well the songs).The video quality is also a problem. Most of the video is clear but there are times that is distorted and is pretty hard to see the images because of the annoying lights of the distortion.Buy the Black Sabbath Story vol. 1 and Last Supper instead, witch are the the best dvds until now.DVD: Is a shame that Balck Sabbath never had a great complete DVD with their greatest hits.Adios."
1,The sound is awful,"This would be a great DVD if they remastered the sound. The video is good, but I am not exagerating on the sound. The sound is mono x 2 and there is no bass at all. For Sabbath that is criminal. The dynamic range of the music is so compressed that their seems to be nothing below 3Khz or above 7Khz. No base, no highs, just monotonic mid-range.I hope they go back and remaster the sound. I would gladly pay $50 or whatever for this DVD if they did. I did watch it, but it was so painful I went with live sound from memory and watched the video with the sound down.I have never played it since."
5,Black Sabbath's last Triumph as the Original 4.,"Five stars. Only a few slips in Ozzy's voice but you'll have that. A great perfomance. No one gets a crowd going like Ozzy. Of course I can't leave Geezer, Bill and the Riffmaster out of it. They did well. All in all, this is a great buy."
2,aa re u forreal,"i realize this is an old concert but are you for real. this is like someone took a camcorder to the concert and shot it. i own alot of concerts but this is by far the worse audio i own. ive got desent stereo eqip and can usually fix most stuff to sound allright but there is no hope for this concert. was really lookin forward to watcin this, very, very disappointed"
1,"great show,horrible sound","the concert is great,the band kicks a**! but the sound is pathetic! i have to turn my tv up to 100 just hear it"
2,"Should have been great, except..","This would have been a great concert to enjoy, except the audio is extremely poor.On a 1 - 10 scale, the loudest you can play this disc is a 3. After that,the sound breaks up.How can you enjoy a Sabbath concert and not play it LOUD!..."
5,BLACK SABBATH NEVER SAY DIE 1978 LIVE,BEING AN ADVID SABBATH FAN I HAD TO PURCHASE THIS. ANYONE WHO LOVES SABBATH WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. A DEFINETE PLUS FOR YOUR COLLECTION. MUCH BETTER THAN THE BOOTLEGS THAT WERE GOING AROUND.
2,below average DVD,"This is a below average DVD for the concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. The length is only 1 hour whereas the actual show was likely over 1.5 hours. I bought a bootleg of a concert for this tour (recorded in Glasgow May 1978). That show ran over 1.5 hours, and included lengthy, interesting solos from Bill Ward and Iommi. Every song on Paranoid was played, albeit not each one in full. Why the entire show cannot be put on DVD is beyond me. I really hope that in future a full length concert DVD of Black Sabbath will come out. Hopefully this would come from the Sabotage tour which is Sabbath at their peak."
2,Proven to be historically inaccurate!,"I was thrilled to purchase this book, only to find-straight away-inaccuracies in its claim of Tudor history. Queen Elizabeth I was not bald, but rather wore wigs and many women shaved their heads, to give the appearance of a high forehead, a sign of high intelligence during this period. The claim that Smeaton was Elizabeth's real father is also a falsity. While this may have been titillating during the past 20 years, it is now just disappointing."
5,Robertson Brothers Are Back,"The Robertson Brothers possess that pure vocal blend of brotherly harmonies found uniquely within a family.The Last Love song represents a change in life for lead singe Geoffrey as the song is close to his heart at the break up with his fiancé.The new album ""Here"" (CCBK7048B Transistor / BMG Music) is being re-released on 21 April in time for mothers day with some bonus tracks also included - this is the definitive adult contemporary album - a must buy for music lovers."
3,Incredibly loud,"This is not a complete review because I returned this saw after turning it on one time. It's VERY loud. I've used circular saws that weren't this painfully loud. The lower speed settings were also badly regulated, the tool surged until mid-range. I'd rather pay a little more for something that is more refined."
3,OK not great,"We do not listen to Raffi, but I was looking for a book that I could sing with and do actions. My toddler loves songs. The first and last verse are fine, but the middle verse is ""If you are bananas and you know it, ring a ling.""What is that supposed to mean?? My kids and I tried to think of an action to go along with that, but ended up marking out those words with a marker and replacing them with stomp your feet.The board book is ok, but very long and so bends easily.Overall I would not recommend this book unless you really like Raffi."
3,"I don't dislike it enough to return it, but I don't love it either.","My youngest child's favorite book is a board book of The Wheels On The Bus by Raffi so I bought this book for her thinking she might enjoy it, too. She doesn't. This book has a completely different style of illustrations than in The Wheels On The Bus. It is a board book, so that's nice. But I don't like Raffi's modified song lyrics (i.e.: ""If you're bananas and you know it"") so I don't sing it as written in the book. It isn't as fun as TWOTB and the pictures aren't as pretty; there isn't as much to look at. In almost every way it's an inferior book to Raffi's TWOTB. If it wasn't a hassle to return it, I'd return this one."
1,not the traditional song,"My kids love this song so I thought I would buy the book. Sadly, the words are not the traditional words...""If you're beautiful and you know it..."""
4,The Lonely Man,"Jack Palance portrays a reformed gunfighter trying to live down his past and forge a relationship with his bitter son (played by Anthony Perkins) all-the-while being tracked down by a gang of killers out to test his reputation.Neville Brand,Lee Van Cleef,Claude Akins and Elisha Cook are fitting as the stalking gang. Another must have for us 50s Westerns fans."
3,"Good for reading, not for a course","Its a good read, but its a shame if they are still using this book in school, so much more about quality is discovered every year. Great for basics though."
5,Perfect,"This Coleman stand is perfect for lamps, and it is very sturdy and compact that you can use for other things other than a lamp."
4,Works well and has more than one use...,Initially bought this for a Coleman lantern which has failed twice. So I would like to congratulate Coleman on this product even if I can't for the lantern. It collapses into a small enough package similar to a camp chair. The bag is comes with is a bit thin and the feet have started to poke through but I drive on some pretty bad roads so the jostling in the back of the truck may have a hand in this.The second use is as a flag pole. I like the small flags made for boating. These flags usually come with rivets so you can put the top one on the same piece which the lantern is hung from and use the flag clip or anything similar to connect to the upright pole. Works great.
5,Great stand,"It is easy2use & has been very useful, but sometimes I wish the arm was just a tad longer for my use"
2,Unusual owl,"I put this ""owl"" on the fridge. So far, no one has recognized it as an owl. It is kind of a disappointment for a Wild Republic product."
3,ANGELA!,"Angela! Please e-mail me at tuba@nbc-2.com. I am 35 years old, and grew up worshiping your father and uncle. When I was 19, I drove to NO, and was appalled at what had happened to the Dukes. I know the true story about how John Shoup stole the name, and want to help. I am in the media in Ft. Myers, FL and have contacts at the Today show, as I have appeared on it twice. PLEASE CONTACT ME!"
4,FAST~,The package was processed and arrived extremely fast! I appreciate the quick service! Item was as described in the listing
4,Application of Petri net in Flexible Manufacturing Systems,Application of Petri net in Flexible Manufacturing Systems modelling and perfomance analysis
2,Does not fit 2009 Ford Focus gas pedal,"I bought this item for my 2009 Ford Focus. The product advised that it fit this vehicle. The break pedal pad fit okay. The gas pedal pad however does not fit. I have tried to get it on the pedal several times and it just does not fit the small curved gas pedal on this vehicle. I can get one end or the other on but not both. I have a set on my 2007 Ford Focus, from another manufacturer, that has a metal strap that goes around the underside of the pedal that fit fine. They have worked for over two years now. I would not recommend this product."
5,Works wonderfully,"Nothing to say here, installed it onto the pedals with relative ease and have been using it since the purchase. Would recommend this product to others ;)"
3,doesn't fit!,"This product is great for the price but after i had put mine on the brake it didn't fit over my accelerator. I drive a 96 silverado which is an insanely popular model so i think ""universal"" is a pretty inaccurate description and from the looks of the other reviews it doesn't fit either. they also squeak against shoes when they're wet and the screws might come loose but they are a pretty cheap product"
5,Nice,"Nice and stylish, but beware if you drive barefoot! The petals do get a little toasty when parked in the sun for a long time"
4,CHA CHA CHA,"JUST LIKE THE COMPANION CD, MAMBO AT THE PALLADIUM, THIS CD DOES NOT FEATURE ANY ""LIVE"" MUSIC. BUT IT IS A GOOD CD NEVERTHELESS. SOME OF THE CHA CHA TUNES ARE A BIT SLOW AND DRAG A BIT, BUT THE MUSIC IS GOOD, ANYWAY, THE MUSICIANS ARE SUPERB. THE MAMBO CD IS BETTER, THO'."
5,"Difficult poems much of the time, but worth the effort even if the reader doesn't understand everything--hint: use a dictionary.","Hill is a magnificent poet who wrote very little poetry for many years. Then, as self-admitted, he was given Prozac for depression and it liberated (and lubricated) his poetic talent. His longer poems are Nobel-prize worthy (others have noted this same level of quality). As a life-long reader of poetry from age 16 to 62 who especially prizes the uusual greats, e.g., Keats, Shelley, Yeats, Eliot, Herbert and of course Shakespeare, his poems compare favorably with these poets and are far better than virtually all poetry/fiction written in the last 50 years. He resides on a high plateau with Elizabeth Bishop and Flannery O' Connor. His poems are serious, but humor infuses most of his poems and adds to their high quality. Anyone claiming to know the poetry of the last 50 years must familiarize themselves with these wonderful, magical and often-profound poems."
4,Absolutely Not Nonsense,"At first glance, this book might be mistaken for ""Chariots of the Gods"" hokum -- it's about pyramids, it suggest prehistoric connections between widely scattered civilizations, and it has an entire chapter on planetary catastrophes. However, this is a very serious effort. Granted, it raises a lot more questions than it answers, and can be a little monotonous in spots. But as a former geology major, I didn't spot any pseudo-science (which is not surprising, given that the primary author has a Ph.D. in Geology from Yale) and I found much food for thought.Sure, if it turns out that the whole theory of cultural diffusion is wrong, (similarities in disparate civilizations are due to migration and interconnection rather than parallel developoment) this book will be little more than an amusing footnote in the history of science. But then, plate tectonics was once a crackpot theory. This is a serious book that deserves to be read."
3,Pardon this interuption,"After reading the reviews for this book, I just had to interject this bit of advice: If the idea of communication between, or common origins of, pyramid building civilisations turns you on, then by all means buy a used copy of Cyrus H. Gordon's Before Columbus. You will not regret it."
2,Good fiction,"The science is tenuous and some of it sounds like fiction. If you want a good bit of fiction and alternate view of civilization read ""Fifth Age of the Maya""."
5,Life saver!!,"I want to say that I was so close to putting my sony camera on ebay because it didn't come with a rechargeable battery. Then I ordered this battery, just received it actually and it works!! I am so thrilled that I can finally stop paying $10 for each duracell battery!! This battery is a life saver!!"
3,Interesting but of limited use and there are much better,"Although this book has been feted by many there are frankly better, more interesting and more scholarly works availible. Alison Plowden does not really give any good idea of the structure and organisation of the English Secret Service, and she fails, on the other angle of making it seem interesting to non historians. However if you are a historian (as I am) this is a useful book to read but there are other books that are equally or more useful. Examples would be Conyer's Read Biography of Sir Francis Walsingham or (and this book should appeal to the non historian as well as being very useful to the historian) Charles Nicoll's 'The Reckoning'."
3,"Enjoyable, but nothing really special","Brust is another one of those authors that I somehow managed to miss, even though he has quite a few novels to his credit and a sizable fan following. I was wanting something light and adventurous, having gotten bogged down in the middle of Durrell's Clea. Jhereg was what I expected. A clean, no-frills adventure of an assassin who might have taken a job that was too much for him.I sit thinking about that last line and the possibility that I may have offended the Brust legions, for it is true that Brust's world is unique and interesting. He also does a good job of avoiding info-dump, letting the reader slowly discover his world and its rules. But, after acknowledging his creativity in society and planet-building, when it comes to plot, there's not much new. Like Bujold, may be I'm making a mistake by reading these early, journeyman works and trying to match it with their reputation that is instead based on a larger volume of work or a later, master-level effort."
4,Fun and action-packed fantasy for all,"I have read all but the latest installment of this series (Issola), and I have to say that they're all fun to read. I equate the main character, Vlad Taltos, with James Bond. Charismatic, intelligent, dangerous, with enough high-powered friends to fill a small warehouse; this guy has it all. Intrigue, violence, and magic is the Taltos series in a nutshell. No prose or flowery descriptiveness here, which makes each installment a quick and easy read. Great stuff for someone with limited read time, or for someone longing for some fast action."
2,Amateur and Badly Placed,"Brust's style in Jhereg is conversational, sarcastic and annoying. The main character's best friend, a tiny dragon with poisonous venom, exists to make sarcastic wisecracks that only the main character, Vlaad, can hear. On the whole, the chracters are uninteresting and flat. Vlaad is supposed to be an assassin, but he doesn't assassinate anyone in this book. The book also falls into the amateur fantasy novel trap: consant allusions to previous events and/or other people and locations that sound infinitely more interesting than the goings-on depicted. Brust's world is hardly as interesting as the multitude of other post-Tolkien fantasy universes; there is little to differentiate it from all the rest.Badly placed because it seems like the fifth or sixth novel in the series, not the opening.I give him two stars for effort."
1,Don't waste your time,"Alot of people have given this book glowing reviews, and I really can't understand what they see in it. The characters are bad stereotypes, conflicts are resolved too easily, and the dialogue is flat and awkward. The humor that so many of these readers have raved about consists mainly of uninspired wisecracks. One thing that I particulary disliked was the way the author would continually allude to and explain events that had happened before the story took place. He did this ALOT. It felt like this was the 3rd, 4th, 5th book in the series and the author was trying to remind you of what had happened in previous books. But this was supposed to have been the first book in the series, the first book set in this world. The most annoying part was that the backstory that he describes sound infinately more interesting than the events in this book."
3,Look closely,"These knives may have ""ergonomic"" handles, but they look really strange in a place setting. I do not like the handles, and I think they are too big compared with the blade. The blade is serrated. It works like most other serrated steak knives. Another reviewer mentioned that the fat handles do not fit easily into the drawer, and this is true. The blades will get spots if put into the dishwasher. Not bad for the price, but not something that looks good on the dinner table."
3,Lemony!,"The lemon flavor is a little intense for my liking but I still enjoy this blend. When I run out of this package, I'll go back to the regular green tea."
1,Very bitter,"This is one of the most unpleasant teas that I have ever tasted. It is bitter, with none of the zippy flavoring that lemon and green tea are supposed to have. The Celestial Seasonings version of this tea is much better."
2,Mediocre at Best,"Mike Oldfield is a very talented musician, but unfortunately, little of that talent shows up in this album. It's just your standard issue acoustic new age relaxation fluff. Check out Tubular Bells II or The Songs Of Distant Earth to see what this guy is *really* capable of."
1,Approaching rock bottom,Mike Oldfield launched from the summit of Everest (Tubular Bells)and has been descending in quality ever since. He was a brilliant and innovative artist with a legacy of several classic CDs. Occasionally there is a surprise improvement but the prognosis is terminal. Purchase Oldfield's albums in chronological order and you won't be disappointed because you will only buy one too many. The title says it all. Mike is on an astral voyage. The album is ear-wash. Genius has become medeocrity. So sad.
5,Brilliant,Another brilliant Mikes album. The album with tradicional Celtic sound. Very calm.Wonderful
3,Occasionally uplifting,"New-aging Celtic fusions can suffer sterile pratfalls of the elevator-minded mentality, but more often pulls through with enough instrumental and compositional integrity to make this voyage worth taking."
4,Nice !,"This is a pretty good record.It can however be a bit boring, if you are not in the mood to this kind of music.I think it is worth a buy."
1,damaged items,one bottle was dented and the second bottle was opened and spilled inside wrapping. I tried contacting someone about this but have yet to get anything back.
2,Wrong version,"I was just given the name of the book, not the version or ISBN and apparently I paid quite a bit of money for a book published in 1985. Since it's a textbook on Neuroscience it is quite outdated and not at all usable."
5,Excellent Hex Key Set,"This set is a quality product and is highly recommended. It comes with both English and metric tools along with the pictured plastic organizers. The organizers help keep track of the tools and makes it obvious if a tool is missing. The ProHold is nice and works well but the polymer tab that holds the screws does wear out over time and does not work as effectively. The ball end is very nice if you need to remove a screw with the hex wrench at an angle. Overall, this is a state-of-the-art tool and I know of none better. It is an excellent value and is highly recommended.Pros:Cost, quality, full dual English / metric set, organizer, ProHold, coated for corrosion protectionCons:ProHold becomes less effective over time"
2,"As someone else said, typical DePalma...","meaning it starts with what's an extremely interesting plot, loaded with great possibilities, and instead of becoming a great film, sinks into illogical sludge. It's a shame, too, because DePalma obviously has talent...he just seems to lack follow-through. The ending isn't wry or clever or cinematic art -- it's senseless and leaves the viewer feeling cheated."
4,The Prelude to the 2005 Butterfly Affect,"This is not for the underaged due to the same sex scenes in the beginning scenes, otherwise it is an excellent drama. It is about a ruthless thief who finds redemtion after she and her partner betray their gang. Excllent twists and turns with a curious and amazing ending!"
1,Another DiPalma Disaster,"Don't get me wrong, I have liked DiPalma in the past; Carrie and The Untouchables come to mind as fine films he's made. This film though is a disaster. First, he falls into his old trap of trying to do Hitchcock better than the master. He clearly isn't up to the task. On top of this he has pasted on every cliche of French art film. But the real annoyance is the numerous times he resorts to cheap tricks for his suspense. You will not see the twists coming because they are so painfully illogical. And then the final insult...The ""Dallas"" trick. It was all a dream.Or a nightmare."
5,great exotic fantasy thriller,"perhaps a very european movie, I love european movies coz it shows a lot of landscapes, of all the Antonio Banderas movie, this is his finest, he shows his acting skills here, he's not just and action star but also a good actor"
3,5 Stars If Lead Could Act,"The story line of this movie kept you guessing. The plot twists were many and kept my attention. However the lead was played by a model. While she looks sexy most of the time, her lack of acting ability detracted from the enjoyment of the movie. I would have given the movie 5 stars if the producer had used an actress for the lead.If you want to watch this kind of movie I would suggest Body Double instead. The lead actress is just as sexy and she can act. The movie has the same kind of plot twists."
2,Get to the ending already!,"I tried to enjoy Femme Fatal, I really did. But this movie seemed to just drag on and on. Not only that, the plot of the movie was not really made clear until the end. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and the other woman making out at the first of the movie was just plain nasty. Rebecca's good looks is why I give Femme Fatal a second star and I would give it 2.5 stars just to be nice. I don't understand why so many people raved over this movie unless they just liked seeing Rebecca almost nude. Still, I would recommend seeing Femme Fatal at least once to see what you think of it but don't watch it if you're feeling sleepy or just not in a good mood."
2,Ugh,"Maybe it's just me. But I found this movie's plot very hard to follow. Only after it was thoroughly explained to me (as thoroughly as possible, since it leaves room for ambiguity) did I realize how truly awful and dumb it was.I won't give away any plot points here, but in my opinion, it relied on some cinematic devices that aren't clever - they're outright cheating. There are no likable characters, and I still don't understand what motivated them--nor do I care, anymore. The visuals were fine and there was some eye candy (excluding the pedestrian and plot-unrelated voyeurism, whose effect was more boring than beguiling), so I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Overall, I really wish I could have this two hours of my life back."
3,"""Femme Fatigue""","When I saw this movie in the theater, I thought I was in France. It felt like one of those erotic thrillers you'd see at Cannes Film Festival. Really, ""Femme Fatale"" is insanity. A dream within a dream? Laure or Lily (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) was a jewel thief who robbed a film festival and cheated her lover in the process. After she left to France many years later, a photographer named Nick (Antonio Banderas) believed that the rich wife of an important invidual was in fact this jewel thief. I forgot to mention that her partners in crime were after her. Understand? The movie should've been called ""Femme Fatigue."" It's that tiring and you'll probably stop concentrating after ten minutes. Of course I get it, I'm brilliant. People may have more fun studying for the SATs than to watch this movie. I have to point out that the cinematography is eye catching and mesmerizing. I'm giving it three stars because it was something fresh that was released recently and it deserves to be seen."
2,more like Femme Fatality,"maybe my expectations were too high but this movie just didn't get my attention very much the movie is slow and deary throughout as well as confusing, one word to describe it is well uninteresting."
2,Review for Theatrical Release,"The new de Palma movie tells the story of a thief who steals a jewel at the Cannes festival, switches identity and flies to America, only to return and be caught by a paparazzi's camera. Then a cat and mouse game begins, and the thriller is good. In the end, de Palma refuses to abandon the femme fatale, and remakes the story to give it a different ending. The plot is weak and the acting is far from good. For good de Palma see Dressed to Kill."
3,erotic,this is defenitly erotic and it has some seamy moments including the beginning with Rebecca Romijn Stamos and that one girl and when Stamos does the little dance for Banderas. Antonio must of loved that and must of made Melanie jealous. also theres a nude scene involving Stamos in the water(John Stamos im jealous of you) a little confusing at times and a little off kilter. but all in all it was enjoyable and it was a nice treat
1,Bad !,"I have not missed much of Brian De Palma's movies. In fact, I can say that some of his earlier efforts like Dressed to kill, Blow Out, Body Double, Carlito's way & Untouchables....just to name a few are examples of fine motion picture making. But, what we have here in FEMME FATALE is an absolute mis-mash. The opening sequence has got to be one of worst ever. The dialogues are lame. The camera work is similar to De Palma's earlier work Body Double...so nothing new there either. Critics say that the first 15~20 mins holds the key to a film's success. Femme Fatale loses it in the first ten minutes itself. Until a better effort....."
1,I guess a bad movie has to be made every year or so....,"I haven't seen many downright bad movies in my lifetime and if I do I usually don't comment on them but this movie just gave me absolutely no choice. It had a very promising title and with Stamos on the front how could I resist it. Halfway through the movie, I was thinking of all the other things I could be doing with my time. Plot is horrible, acting is horrible, and the cinematography made me feel like I was seeing double the entire movie. Don't get me wrong, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is a work of art but I just don't think her acting can fill a lead role. Please don't waste your money."
1,What is the french word for (...)?,"Im glad of one thing after seeing this movie. Im glad the manager of the theater was nice enough to give my $8.00 back when i walked out. I must say i enjoyed the first 10 minutes of the movie. A few people got shot, there was an excellent lesbian make-out scene and a lot of nice (...) shots... in the first 10 minutes. After that it was filled with all the charm of a second rate French Film, brought down even more with a ""Pretending to be Gay"" performance from Antonio Banderas. This movie is (...), in french subtitles. If you ever rent this movie, watch the first 10 minutes, and be kind enough to rewind it so the next person doesnt miss the only good part."
1,Theatrically Challenging? Please!!!,"Well, this movie tries to transport you between different times and end up confusing you. To some, this is called theatrical challenge; to me, however, it's a plain dis-organization. The participating actors are talented, but the disinteresting nature of the story makes me to give this movie THREE THUMBS DOWN."
4,Well Worth the Price of Admission,"It was interesting and fun. In particular, it was a kick to see a strong female lead character whose eyes are wide open."
3,okay,"The visual sense is probably the best part of the film. It has some really silly Hardy Boys type plot twists. After the biggest twist of the film was revealed, a guy near me got up angrily and walked out. I did feel a bit cheated at that point myself, but it wasn't enough to sink the film for me. I didn't look at my watch once, and so that says a lot. With all its flaws, it really kept my attention."
1,"Antonio, definitely not Desperado!","Really, just because 2 women get it on in a bathroom stall doesn't make this a great, ground-breaking film. So what?Antonio, I love watching your more gritty or your more humorous films. This story line really doesn't compliment your diverse acting abilities and it only tends to pigeon-hole you to specific roles. Bad move.Didn't like the female star in this. All fluff and no substance.Isabow"
2,Only one scene worth watching.,"One great striptease scene, but even then you won't see any full flesh.Rent it if you have to watch don't buy it."
1,Maybe the Worst Movie Ever Made?,"Boy, Jeff Shannon is really off with his editorial review here. This movie is a real stinker, and fails on every possible level, beginning with the acting, the characters, and the story. Here's the catch: you have to see it to believe it, so how do you do that? Buy the DVD? Rent one? You've already lost by giving the filmmakers your money.IMHO, Brian DePalma lost his mind around the time he directed Bonfire of the Vanities. The most amazing thing about Femme Fatale is that anyone financed it!"
2,little hit&alot of miss,this film was interesting for a minute then it lost me.the story writing was a bit under developed on a whole&after a while the pacing of the film got fragged down.it had a few moments but not enough to maintain my interest.
2,"BORING, GOOD MUSIC AND BAD ACTING","Straight to the point : excellent beginning (5 stars).....pretty steamy (in my opinion almost rated X). The plot is confusing when DePalma plays with backflashes (it needs more structure) and at the end theres is a twist. Some scenes are too hard to believe, the script is weak. Antonio Banderas needs to transform into the character he plays."
5,Truly erotic and truly thrilling,"I thnk Brian DePalma invented the erotic thriller.I don't mean the lamers that substitute blood for thrills and flashes of skin for eroticism. This film defines the genre.DePalme weaves and intricate and initially confusing and incredible plot line then sprinkles hints and giveaways throughout the movie that leads to a wonderful surprise that will have you wondering why you did not guess it.I love DePalmas blend of imagery, score and dialog, as another reviewer mentions, the score alone rates this film at 5 stars.The story is mesmerizing and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos does a remarkable job in the dual role of Lilli/Laure.When you get to the end you will want to watch it again immediately and if anything it is more enjoyable the second time around - can't say that about many mystery thrillers.Buy this movie and enjoy.I would buy the soundtrack CD in a heartbeat."
3,Dallas,"While there was some enjoyment of the picture, the plot twist left me disappointed with the resolution. If you've ever seen the old tv soap-opera drama, ""Dallas"", then my title says it all regarding the final plot twist."
4,Typical De Palma,"My title says it all. This is a director who has a groove, has his audience, and has his story-lines, each and every production. He is one of my all time favorite directors of all time, perhaps second only to Alfred Hitchcock.The story, yes, is a bit confusing at times, but who cares? The mesmerizing story-line and wonderful soundtrack are what makes this movie so wonderful!I give it two high hard thumbs up! WAY UP!!!MC White said: Check it out!!!"
2,"Interesting on the way through, but bad ending","Exciting in the beginning, real suspens in the middle, but ending to nowhere. It's like missing a penalty kick."
2,FEMME DEJA VU,"FEMME FATALE (Warner) contains every element you'd expect from Brian De Palma: Hitchcockian twists, voyeurism and a misogynistic sub-text.Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is the film noirish bad girl who brings men to their doom and Antonio Banderas is a photog ensnared in her fatal mystique.Spoiler warning: the long dream sequence left me feeling betrayed by the filmmaker after I was enticed by the story of the jewel heist during the Cannes film fest.Is De Palma toying with self-parody?Limited extras and, sadly, no commentary."
3,Average - good value when Amazon offers Lipton on sale,We combine with decaf Large Lipton Ice Tea Bags to make iced tea. Good value on Amazon when special (happens aboug 2x per year) on Lipton purchases $15-$20 off. We drink a lot of iced tea in Florida so quantity is no issue for us. Besides keeps fresh until you open the package.
1,exchange alley,"I spent a week of backing up, losing which russian character with simular names were which, what the main characters name was and came away totally confused. How ""exchange alley"" in New orleans or Lee Harvey Oswald became even a part of this book was to entice readers to a subject that wasn't really relevent. I was left in a cloud of confusion at the end with no justice for the evil doers."
2,"Well Written, but Why?","Good writing, lots of plot twists, but in the end it was a pointless long book marred by unneeded extremely graphic violence. As another reviewer noted, the author never ties the book's title to the story other than a few offhand references. Things that should be explained aren't, and when I finished the book I felt that I had nothing to show or value for the time taken to read it. And yes, the typhos were extremely irritating."
4,"Intelligently written, good read, but somewhat flawed","I read this through to the end - it starts out as an interesting cross between police procedural and international espionage novel, then ends up in almost a ""Manchurian Candidate""-like family melodrama. Although the author is very knowledgeable, and weaves in all sorts of interesting allusions, and is a much more creative writer than you find in your general airport bookstore, the whole novel is somewhat of a tease, files never revealed, the title location (Exchange Alley, New Orleans)never visited, certain potentially intersting sexual liaisons between main characters that are raised as potentials but never consummated. Kind of an odd book overall. But I give it four stars, and, like I said, I read it through."
1,Eew Gross,"Love Mr. Walsh's writing, for example, his column in the New York Post. But this novel is just gross. I kept thinking there was a purpose for the depravity. Alas, the gross depravity just gets worse. Was not able to get through even half.Sorry, Michael, I love you, just not this novel."
3,COMPLEX READ,"This book is not for reading piecemeal. I found it most confusing because of the series of plot lines that we followed, slipping back and forth between. Nothing unusual there. I'm not certain but we were mostly moving through time lines that eventually brought us to the ""present"". The author was perhaps too clever with this device. Did he write the multiple stories and then just cut and paste them together? I have never read chapters that changed timelines every paragraph as they did at the end. There was a lot of bigoted characters -- at first I thought the author himself might be reflecting his own thoughts -- but the the characters were just mostly unsympathetic. No one was clearly heroic. First novels are a mixed blessing. I am happier with my current Cornwell."
5,Very Handsome Cover Photograph,"This calendar has a daily format. The photograph changes each day of the week and once on the weekend. The cover photograph is especially handsome - appears to be a male golden retriever. The 2006 edition is scheduled to be released on or about July 1, 2005. This calendar includes over 300 different photographs of golden retrievers."
4,The Carpetbaggers,"Although fictional, the story is obviously a take-off on Howard Hughes well before the ""Aviator"" and other non-fictional stories on his life were produced."
1,The Carpetborers,"This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish. It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp. Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot. George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on ""The A-Team"". Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture. It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill. Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy. The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular). If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow."
4,Terrific Movie,"This is a great movie that captures the dynamism that must have driven Howard Hughes, which Peppard's character is clearly modeled upon. Made many years ago now but the characters are still inspiring."
5,"Classic ""bio-pic""","One of those morally objectionable movies of the 60's that seems mild today, but stilldepicts a shameless narcissistic view of America and especially Hollywood. Entertaining no less becauseof the narcissism and vanity. In the context of a character like Howard Hughes no wonderits seems All-American. The climax in the movie with the show down of Nevada Smith and Cord is perfect cinema closure."
5,"Excellent ""Old Movie""","The Carpetbaggers was a movie I remember years ago, It was excellent then and it still is!"
2,not too great,"sure after the first one or two it's ok, but after a while, there's not much texture too it, the tastes meld together, it gets bland,.....I still have most o fthe box left if anyone wants them....."
3,Mediocre protein bar,"Fabulous ingredients and great nutrition, but not that good. Somewhat of a chore to eat. It is very thick and takes a long time to chew. This is surprising, Kashi's other products are so much better!"
2,Disgustingly sweet,"I wanted to like this bar because it's high in protein and fiber, but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars (31g!). It's much too sweet. If they took away some of the sugar, it might be edible."
2,Not so good.,"I got these for my daughter who prefers chewy to crunchy. I generally love Kashi stuff, but these were a disappointment. Even my daughter said yuck."
3,golean,"I liked these bars,but got tired of them after the 3rd one.They are ok once in a great while,but not often."
3,Prefer GOLEAN rolls,"I enjoy GoLean rolls and ordered a bar by mistake. There is no way the bar even comes close as to taste, but there not terrible."
3,Too sweet,"I like the chewy texture of this bar and that it fills you up and has a good amount of fiber. The problem is that this bar is too sweet. Believe me, I love sweets, but this is just over the top for a protein bar."
2,It's too sweet and no crunch,"I like Kashi products in general, but this bar is too sweet nor was there any crunchy bits of anything. It is a chewy bar, but does not give your jaws the same workout their turtle bar does which was a relief. I think I'll stick the their cereals and granola bars. As for protein bars, I much prefer Balance bars."
4,Hofner Violin Bass,"I was very disappointed in this book. After waiting 26 years for more info on Paul's bass, this edition is pretty thin. The author has many good pictures of vintage instruments, but he could have included so much more. There is no info on current players, construction details, care and maintenance, or tips and techniques. The author is obviously a Paul fan, which is ok, but their are other dimensions to this story. If you are looking for a ""owner's manual"" for your Hofner, this isn't it. If you want pictures of your bass, you will be happy. Go on and buy it!"
2,Hofner 500/1 by Joe Dunn,This book could have provided the Hofner enthusiast with more. There is just basic information on some of the models and some pictures. It is missing so much on the bass that was made famous by McCartney. It was kind of a let down but if your happy with some basic info and a few pics then this book could be for you.
2,Good - should be 4 stars (but I cannot change it...),"Immediate first impressions: 1) headband is neat - very comfortable, 2) driver efficiency is very high - these headphones are much louder than any others that I have.After trying these headphones on several different sources, I determined that they actually sound quite good on an MP3 player (sansa e-280). I recant my earlier criticism about their muddy bass - apparently, my PC or my media player was not up to par."
2,"They work, but sound quality is not good","The sound is very thin. I am not a fan of booming bass, but these sound very thin and wimpy compared to my Sennheiser PX100 headphones which I use at work. Not recommended."
5,cool,"bought this item for myself, used it loved it..pretty light weight, easy on ears, my friends found it cool too so i bought two more and its also cheap so sure worth of money.."
3,It is fine.. not great..,"After using Creative HQ 140 for 4 years before it finally broke,I bought this headphone. I have to say I am not much impressed with this. The style is fine, but it is not comfortable around the neck. I would definitely recommend Creative HQ 140 than this one."
3,"Great sound quality, not comfortable for physical activity","The Good: Decent sound quality.The Bad: Don't stay in place for running. Band is not tight enough.These are probably good if you have a larger than average head, or are wearing them on your ears but somehow over a hoody."
2,Actively uncomfortable on my head,"I bought these and the Sennheiser PMX60 Headphones at the same time for comparison. The sound was equivalent as far as I could tell, but the Sony headphones were really extremely uncomfortable in comparison. The Sennheisers only press slightly at the top of each ear, rather than making me feel like my head is in a vise."
4,Just Love them,"I already had a pair of these headphones, but accidentally broke them :( I looked everywhere for another pair I'd like, but had to buy these again. They look awesome, sound quality is great. The cable is twice as long of any other headphones (great when working at your computer). The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is that they're a little uncomfortable when you have to wear glasses. You won't regret buying these!"
5,One year later and still pleased,"I've used my Sony MDR-G54LP Street Style Headphones daily for over a year now. Completely pleased. Here's how I use them and the features that work for me:- Daily bike commute. Open back let's me hear what's up.- Skiing and biking. Street style rides comfortably below my helmets- Listening. Good sound for pod-casts and music on the move.- Travel. Tangle free cloth covered cable, foldable.- Computer or stereo. Removable extension.Getting another one incase this one ever wears out or gets lost.-Mike"
4,good but not perfect,"Bought this pair of headphones about 6 months back. The headphones are good but not perfect. They look good and the sound quality is good too for such a low price. I use the headphones rough and are normally stored in the front pocket of my backpack. They lasted long (none of my prev. headphones lasted more than 2-3 months) and I'm still using them.I wear spectacles and at first they were a little uncomfortable around my ears but now I got used to them. One major irritant is the v-shaped frame. It doesn't sit properly at the back of the head and frequently touches the collar of my shirt. I have to readjust them every time the frame falls down between my neck and the shirt collar.Overall, 4/5 . Good sound, nice looking, durable but with few drawbacks."
2,Not worth it,"I bought these because I was looking for something I could use while jogging. These are not good for jogging. They get really uncomfortable to wear after about 30 minutes. Also the cord is way too long. I had to loop it several times so that it wasn't hanging ridiculously low. I thought perhaps if I used them when I wasn't jogging that they wouldn't be so uncomfortable. But I find that even when I am just sitting on the sofa with these on that my ears get tired from the weight within about 30 minutes. They sound ok (decent amount of bass), but since I can only wear them for about 30 minutes before they get uncomfortable, I don't find them worth owning. TheSony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)are way better for jogging and cost half the price. For inexpensive general use I'll stick with myV-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black."
3,A Blaxploitation Farce Of Note,"Not to be confused with the 90's Wesley Snipes vehicle, Sugar Hill is the story of a woman seeking revenge against the gangsters who stomped her boyfriend to death after he refuses to sell them his lucrative nightclub business. Unlike the shoot 'em ups ""Slaughter,"" ""Coffy"" and ""Truck Turner"", this film takes on a supernatural bent when the vengeful woman solicits the help of a voodoo priestess (played by Zora Culley, best known for her role as Mother Jefferson on the sitcom ""The Jeffersons"") who summons zombies to carry out her deadly desires--in exchange for her soul, that is.The zombies are outlandish and the death scenes hilarious, some I think which are unintentionally so. Nonetheless, this quirky mix of farce and blaxploitation anger is one of my favorites of the genre and is one no viewer will soon forget. Got a little extra cash? Pick up ""Sugar Hill"" for a ninety-minute good time."
1,Sugar Hill (1974),"Except for the Leading lightskinned honey,(Although I'm more into the lovely and darker Pam Grier and Tamara)This movie is so utterly cheesy and yes what did I expect? on the contrary to other movies of the genre of the era which are more entertaining,this is such a snooze,the acting is so bad you'd think I had made it with a couple of friends.It is just like Blacula and the sequel it really blows chunks."
3,"Night of the Living ""HO""","Alternate Title:""Live and Let Dog""Cheesy, Cliche-Ridden, Campy, In Yo Face...Hilarious"
4,For any of those wondering........,"The DVD for sale is an Asian import...the picture and sound quality is quite good for what it is, but alas, it's presented in full screen. For those who want a copy of this ""classic"", this will do just fine until one of the major distributors wakes up and releases it, in widescreen, one can only hope."
4,That's Entertainment,I bought this one less than thirty minutes into streaming it . It's the sort of film you can't really properly explain to another human being . I mean that in the VERY best sense of the words . It is a very funny movie . It's also delightfully well made . Check it out if you can . Suger is a true honey as well . Groovy gas of a pic . They don't make um like this any more .
5,UN LIBRO ATERRADOR PORQUE YA ES UNA REALIDAD !,"...y quien sabe que consecuencias tenga sobre La Humanidad: Con la clonación, se podrían ""fabricar"" ejércitos de soldados fuertes, sin miedo a la muerte y sin compasión!No sabemos, hasta el momento, si la ingeniería genética es una maldición o una bendición:Pero este libro nos da LAS MEJORES BASES PARA COMPRENDER EL PROCESO DE LA CLONACIÓN...

3,is as described,"It would be great if this toy came with some Tangram patterns to do that this set would be able to follow. That being said, they are very inexpensive, so maybe a book could be recommended that would go with them. My biggest frustration with tangrams is finding puzzles for the kids to lay the pieces on top of to give them an opportunity to figure them out a bit.The puzzles are exactly as described. Good luck."
3,Caveat Emptor,"Be aware: this is disk has software specifically intended for Dell computers - would not work on my Toshiba, even though it also uses Windows XP Tablet PC edition"
3,Very Good but Flawed,"Lots of good and very interesting information. I will try the cleanse; however, the book has a big flaw: it has no references to back up medico-scientific statements made about the liver or other bilogical functions. The few footnotes refer to the author's other books. There are two unrelated chapters at the end of the book written by scientists & duly referenced. Plus, a vegetarian diet is recommended; this can be ignored if you're not into that."
2,Don't waste your money,"I was disappointed by this DVD. The narrator had a very flat boring voice and the DVD was fairly short for what I was expecting. Tried to get my son and husband engaged to watch and they were both underwhelmed. I also bought ""Kiwi Country New Zealand"" which was far superior and contained alot more quality video and exciting narration and video."
4,Enjoyable read...,"Trey does a good job of covering most aspects of how fly fishing for steelhead ""feels."" From the best anglers to the best water to the general methods/gear he gives a good overview of steelhead fishing in general. I enjoy sitting down and reading his observations. If you are looking for a tecnical ""how to"" book, this probably isn't the one (get Dec Hogan's ""Passion for Steelhead"")."
5,But there IS ONLY ONE,"I can't believe that these guys aren't hailed as gods and then put to the ritual sacrifice. 20 years after my first hearing of the only ones, I'm still stuck on their channel."
5,Transformative Book!,"Wow! What a book! This book is an astonishing work. Not only does the author cover all that is necessary, she actually taught me to create an eating plan that works right for me - for my body, for who I am. Talk about customized! I felt like I'd spent hours getting a personal consultation from her by the time I'd read the book. The information is worth the effort. Her website supplemented what I learned in the text and I find myself feeling better all the time! (And looking healthier, too!)"
1,This book was not well researched!!!!!,"I was throughly disappointed with Dr. Axelrod's book on Fraternal orders. I am an educated man, and a member of over 25 friendly socities. Axelrod definately read Schmidt's 1980 book Fraternal Orginizations. This is illustrated via his reporting that ""this groups has not been heard of since 1980."" What he is actually saying is ""that the group has moved headquarters since 1980(when Schmidt reported it)and I do not want to take time and research the new location."" He declares several groups to be long since dead, however they are very much alive. I wish Dr. Axelrod would have looked for sources better, he could have had a better book. This information takes a little bit of hard work to find, however it is easily accessable. after reading various texts I am able to see how Axelrod merely copies their work. I would suggest buying this book, it is fairly interesting, however it is full of inaccurate info."
5,so hot u had to ice me down! J.K.,"I love all of Diana Palmer's books! What draws this reader to her book is i love when the characters have a misunderstanding and share conflicts between them that they have to over come.This one is no exception.Bestselling author Margie Silver has a battle royale on her hands with the older brother of the guy she hoped to marry.Cal Van Dyne is determined that the wedding never takes place.So determined that he sets out to prove she's not good enough for his younger brother that he unexpected finds he wants her for himself! Good luck on that,being that he's an arrogant man!Fire And Ice"
5,Silicone Spatulas,Love the pastel colors and various sizes of the spatulas. There's a size for each cooking need. They are sturdy and stain resistant. They wash great in the dishwasher.
2,Cute but not durable,I've had these for two months and with appropriate use two have already broken. I'm disappointed with the quality. Maybe they work well for people who only want to use them for occasional baking and things. I use my spatulas frequently for cooking.
1,Poor quality,"I bought these about a year ago. I loved the colors and the size of all of these. I was so happy with them at first, but after a very short period of time, they started to fall apart. Little pieces of the silicon part started to fall off and the pink one just recently cracked and broke in half. It was really random and unexpected. I was scooping food out of a bowl and all of the sudden I noticed that the bottom half of my spatula was missing. I had to dig around in the bowl of food to find it. The yellow one is now cracked and I'm thinking it's not going to last much longer. I really liked this set so I am very dissapointed at the poor quality and durability of these. On to find a new set..."
4,New Spatulas,I like the pastel colors. They not quite as stiff as I prefer for scraping cans or bowls but they do the job.
3,Title for review,We purchased the spatula to make fudge. It worked as good as eexpected. I was hoping the heads were going to be a little bigger. The blerb about the product was exactly as written. Good product
2,Just ok,I only give it two stars because the spatula can come out. It can easily trap leftover dough or food in it if u don't pay attention cleaning it.
5,"Best of the best of the best, hands down","Best of the best, have used many brands over the years and none have lasted as long as this brand. The MIU France spatulas are the best, hands down and we are extremely pleased with this product, you will not go wrong in buying this set from this maker."
3,Not very sturdy,"I wanted spatulas with a silicone handle so I could put them in the dishwasher. The ones with wooden handles have to be handwashed, and that can be a pain. These are heat resistant and dishwasher safe, but not at all sturdy. The heads of the spatulas are too soft and bend a little too much, and they also slide off of the handles. If you're mixing a heavy cookie dough, these won't get the job done. They are fine for stirring some veggies in a non-stick skillet or for scraping cake batter out of a mixing bowl, but that's about it."
3,"useful, but there's better out there","These are perfectly useful spatulas, but what makes them NOT spectacular is 1)handles are not heat resistant and will melt if too close to a heat source 2)the raised area in the middle can be difficult to clean, if you don't get to wash them right away, things stick, you have to work to get dried on ""stuff"" out from around the raised area.Otherwise, nice colors, function as you need a spatula to."
3,Ok,"The smaller one is great for cleaning out jars of food, the other three can function pretty well for cake batters and the like. For cooking, I don't think so... They are heat resistant but the are not strong enough, not at all like my other more expensive one (you know the most expensive ones!). I have one of the other kind, which I bought as a tester. That one works great and is very reliable for everything, but too spendy!That is why I opted for these. They work OK, but I wouldn't buy them again, nor really recommend them for cooking."
2,Don't like it at all,"I use silcone spatulas for baking almost everyday and like to try different new spatule.I order them due to the cheap price and muti-size. However; I was disappounted after try them out.First, the tip is too long from the handle; therefore, the tip is too weak to get nice control.Second, it can not scrap bowl clean like my old OXO does due to the long tip.Third, the whole tip is easy to come out from handle."
3,Just ok,these spatulas work fine but you have to be careful what you use them on. The large purple one got all stained when I used it to clean out the bowl containing my sauce for lasagna. I have others that don't do this.
4,Scrapers rated high !,3 sizes: 1 large2 medium1 small (Very useful size)They all do the job & do it well. Color coding is good if using several in food preparation (IF you can remember what color you used for what!)
5,just great!,"i can't believe i waited so long to get silicone spatulas!! they make a WORLD of difference! i have ruined many a spatula stirring (e.g.) chocolate over the stove. no more! i even started using them in my savory cooking, to push around the tomatoes, chicken, mushrooms, whatever i'm cooking--they won't melt, and they won't scratch the pan!!i've had them for a few months and haven't had any problems, so i can't comment on the durability complaints."
2,ok but not great,"These are a little flimsier that I would have liked. They bend too easily and are hard to use to get things out of the pot. Also, they bend too much to be able to use as a mixing tool. I was disappointed in these. But, since I got them, I'm using them until I can find something better. The reviews pointed out that these were a bit flimsy. I should have listened to them."
2,Disintegrates after a while,"I loved these spatulas and I had them for a while but I had to throw them away because they got so bad. Don't expect them to last more than a year or so. I have a LOT of spatulas so I wasn't always using these constantly but these are the only ones which fell apart, literally."
2,Acceptable spatulas,"Four of these cost $9.99, plus they were further discounted by Amazon's 4 for 3 sale and super saver shipping. At $2 a spatula, they are worth a try. I like the pastel colors, and they are four different sizes. The handles seem sturdy, but reading another review, I know to keep them away from the heat. The handles easily separate from the tops, so they will go in that way in my dishwasher. I use spatulas every day, so if they don't hold up, I'll be revisiting this review.September 12, 2011 update: Well, over time, these did not hold up. Although they appear to be warranted for high, cooking heats, mine fell apart. I do not have a single one left. It is possible, however, that back in 2007 they were not made to withstand high heat."
2,Germs get in and never come out.,"I'm satified with the funtionality of these spatualas. However I was disapointed to see that as soon as I unwrapped them, the silicone heads came off of the handles quite easily. I had hoped to avoid this problem.From an everyday cooking point of view It's not really a problem but if you are at all concerned about food born illness, then you might pass on these. It's arguable thoguh that because you can remove the heads so easily that one can clean in the crevices thoughly. For the record I have never gotten sick from using any spatulas of this type but the point is made nonetheless."
3,removable heads not that good,"they are cheap, but the only thing is the heads are removable, so if something gets into the hole that the handle goes in you might as well throw them away since cleaning that inside of that is practically impossible."
2,Inconsistent in their quality,"As far as they go, they're okay spatulas. But I found that while the pink ones were best for stirring, say, light batter for pancakes, the yellow spatulas were more prone to actually violating the space-time continuum - I had some good pans ruined by tesseracts while I was trying to make scrambled eggs, and I don't need to tell you how tough that is to clean up! Also, the lavender and the blue spatulas tended to cancel each other out - I used the lavender one to stir up some cookie batter, and I dropped it on the floor. So I switched to the blue one, and next thing I knew I had four discrete lumps of sugar, butter, flour and baking soda sitting on my kitchen counter. All I need is a spatula, not violations of causality!"
4,Excellent CD of rare early '50's Doris Day recordings,"This CD of rare radio transcript recordings features some of Doris' most seductive and sultry singing. She performs each song superbly, but standouts are the achingly beautiful ""Stardust,"" in which she performs the lovely, but seldom heard, verse and an utterly simple version of ""I Could Write A Book,"" which highlights the song's poignancy more than any other version I have heard. There are also several truly fun duets with the wonderful Page Cavanaugh Trio, while the remainder feature Doris and a solo piano. While a few of the songs themselves are mediocre, Doris' vocalizing is top notch on all tracks. She had the ability to make even bland songs sound like potential classics. The sound quality is superb, if not the lush sound of her Columbia records. Great liner notes by Dave Dexter, with a paragraph written by Doris herself. Perfect music to cuddle by in front of the fireplace. Intimate and a bit sexy."
1,Don't do it,Looks good the price is right but have had nothing but problems with it since we bought it. ths batter never stays charged says 2.5 hrs and only gets 1 hr plus after you charge it it goes dead in a few hrs of not even using it
1,GARBAGE,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY SONS 1ST BIRTHDAY IN MARCH. WE WERE GOING ON VACATION IN APRIL 12 HR DR. IT WRKS GREAT IF ITS PLUGGED IN BUT TRY TO UNPLUG IT- COMPLETELY DEAD BATERY CHARGED AND ALL. I RETURNED IT 3 DIFFERENT TIMES EVERY ONE WOULD WORK GREAT FOR A WEEK THEN THE SAME THING HAPPENED I CANT BELIEVE THIS PIECE OF CRAP IS STILL ON THE MARKET. SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A GOOD ONE
5,This was my best investment yet!,"I bought one of these while I was on vacation and it has been working for me ever since. It works the same as any top brand name portable DVD player, but I'm glad I saved this much money. Easy to use for you or the kids! I hope this review helped. I know I'm happy with my decision."
1,Terrible! - Beware!,"It's sad, really. I liked the player. It had a lot of features for the price. Got it home and charged it up. About a week later, went to play it off the battery. Nothing. Tried recharging. Nothing. Contacted the company via email. Waited one week with no response. Packed the unit up and returned it. Bought a different brand I'm much happier with. Will never buy another CyberHome product, no matter what the price or features. Terrible support. The stereotypical cheap overseas product. Buy one from a known manufacturer with a good reputatuion."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Bought the unit, battery charged the first time after 4 hours. After that, tried to play unit for first car trip. The battery is dead and does not recharge. Defective battery. I've had no response from manufacturer after two attempts via e-mail, tried customer support hotline.....cold. No answer after on hold for 45 minutes. Beware. Buy a famous name product. Their support should be better. Any support is better than none."
1,No charge,"I waited a week to get this item with a raincheck. Once home quickly realized we could not charge the player! Tried to exchange today only to find out that there are none in stock. Based on the reviews I have seen since, I think I will return for money back and spend more money on a better player. The price seemed too good to be true and I guess it really was."
2,Battery charging problem ruins it all,"First I was very happy with this player: amazing LCD picture quality, plays everything (including my DVD+Rs & DVD+RWs), runs from foreign electricity, carry bag included. I tested it and put it away for a month. Next time I tried, it didn't run from the battery and didn't charge it either. Soon it didn't even worked from AC when the dead battery was in the unit. I returned it and then learned from the CyberHome website that the battery should not be left in the unit. But they don't say if you leave it there then it will never work again. Having read tons of complaints about battery problems I decided not to give this model another try."
2,Battery Charger does not work,I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for car rides. I have had it less than a week and it will not charge. It works fine for car rides with the adapter and when plugged in but will not charge the battery or work without being attached to a power source. Not too portable. I am returning this to Walmart tomorrow. Buyers beware-price looks good but you are not going to get a lot of use out of it. Also gets very hot when plugged in!
2,Worked great - for a month,"When I purchased this DVD player, I found it a great combination of low price and excellent features. I used it for a couple of weeks and the picture was crystal clear, and the sound delivered. I was not thrilled with the quality of the car kit, and would recommend that you buy one separately. There are several good ones around. All of a sudden, the picture just went dead on it, and that's when the trouble started. Despite repeated calls (which always went to Voicemail) and Emails (all unanswered) to the technical services people at Cyberhome, i was never able to get an answer for either technical support or customer service. I finally gave up, swallowed the loss, and bought a polaroid. I have another Cyberhome product, a DVD recorder, and I am very pleased with that. I just hope it never needs warranty service."
1,was not happy,I was very happy when I got this dvd player home pluged is in and the player worked just fine but when it made to the car It worked for couple seconds you can hear the sound but no picture when i final got it to work it for 15minute then no picture again and it was like that for rest of the night I end up taking it for another but the store did not have any more so got another brand but i will say this it great price and it perfect for a small child on a road trip if you can get it to work right
1,Many problems!,"I plugged it in and charged the battery, removed the battery after full charge and put the machine away for our trip.We watched 1 movie on it and the second movie had trouble getting started. That night I could not get it working at all in the hotel. It seems that the battery would not hold even a little charge and when it was plugged in the machine could not find the menu section of any disk. After some struggling I got it started again and it would only run for about 20 minutes at a time. Needless to say, I was happy to return it. (The battery never did recover even after several recharge attempts)"
1,its no good dont buy it,please dont waste your money on this piece if crap..it has barely any volume but when you use the earphones it blasts in your ear but when the earphones are removed to listen to it in the car you cant even hear it ...this product sucks
1,Total Waste of Money!!!,We bought this at Christmas time on sale and have used it very carefully for less than 10 times and suddenly the screen will not come on. I contacted Cyberhome and they made a couple suggestions which did not work. Now they want me to send it in and pay for repair. A total waste of money and quality. Shame on you Cyberhome! Save your money and invest on a quality name and product!
2,Cheap but served a purpose,"I didn't expect much from this product, but after testing it seemed comparable to other low-end players.<br /><br />Knowing that Thanksgiving would include 20 hours in the car with 2 kids my only hope was that it would last the duration, and it did. Forget the battery - use the cigarette lighter adapter or power outlet in the vehicle. Get a headphone amplifier, because it's not really loud enough, but otherwise it works fine for what it is.<br /><br />If you want something durable with a long life expectancy that can survive being dropped by a child, then be prepared to stump up a few hundred more dollars for a name brand. But if cheap and cheerful is adequate for your needs then this should fit the bill."
1,This thing is junk,"Do not buy this horrible product. I got this as a present, and I was thrilled to get it. I try to use it in the car, and it will freeze and the screen will go black all the time. The battery also holds a charge horribly. I can not stand this product. I am happy that someone bought me one of these, but I wish they had bought a different brand."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!,We have exchanged this dvd player for the THIRD TIME. Every time there seems to be some sort of problem with the monitor. The dvd will play for a short while then it will suddenly shut off. Cyberhome should recall this dvd player. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE HAVE MADE --- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD PLAYER!!
1,DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN 1 STAR,"VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS DVD PLAYER AND EVEN MORE SO IN TARGETS RETURN POLICY. THEIR RETURN POLICY IS 90 DAYS. WE USED THIS 2 TIMES WHEN WE 1ST BOUGHT IT, WORKED OK WITH A FEW PROBLEMS. THOUGHT MAYBE THE BATTERY WAS JUST GETTING LOW. PUT IT AWAY AND JUST TRIED IT AGAIN A FEW DAYS AGO. UNFORTUNATELY, PAST THE 90 DAYS. TARGET DOES NOT CARE. CYBERHOME DOES NOT ANSWER THE PHONE. ON THE PHONE WAITING RIGHT NOW. SO FAR 50 MINUTES. WEB SITE I WAS GIVEN DOES NOT EXIST. PLAYER KEEPS SAYING READING AND INSERT DISC WHILE DISC IS IN THERE. BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER PURCHASED. SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY. NOW KNOW WHY IT WAS SUCH A GOOD BARGAIN. WILL NEVER PURCHASE ELECTRONICS FROM TARGET AGAIN."
1,Awful Awful Awful,Don't waste your money. Didn't work the minute I plugged it in and spent 45 minutes futzing with the settings thinking it would help. Go with a brand name - ANY brand name - except CyberHome!!
1,a serious piece of junk,"this is a huge and disappointing piece of junk. i've bought tons of consumer electronics products, including some from cyberhome, but have never purchased a lower quality, cheap, chinsy product ever.read the reviews...do not buy this product."
1,Thanks for your comments,"I have been looking for a Portable DVD player to buy the family for Christmas. My brother in law called me and told me that he had one where he worked for a good price, came with all accessories, nice leather carrying case, etc. I decided to go online and see what one cost brand new. Glad to say that I did and I found this website. Needless to say after I read everyone's comments here, I called him back and told him that I didn't want to invest my money into one of the Cyberhome DVD Players. I would keep my eyes open for another one. Thanks again for this website. Might have saved me a lot of money....."
1,I returned it too!,"I got this as a Father's day gift. The first time we used it on a car trip the player overheated after 45 minutes and the picture and sound started skipping. I thought it might only be due to the travel case but no, it did the same trick while sitting on a tabletop. After reading the reviews AFTER having this problem there was no question I would be returning this. Target was very good about taking return. I replaced it with the Mintek from Costco, which cost less and has two headphones."
1,BAD BAD BAD!,"3 of these failed within a two week period, (screen failure). Finally decided to trade up to Eddie Bauer 7&quot; which also happened to fail, (drive motor). I gave up and got my money refunded!"
1,Awful,"After the first one these I had to return the day after I bought it, it would not read DVD's... The 2nd one the same thing happened only after using the unit once.. But we did not try to use it again within the 90 day return Target policy, so now we are stuck going through Cyberhome.. Target should definately pull this product.. and stand behind it for their customers... They would not exchange it for me because it was longer than 90 days..but my kids only use it on long car rides, and we hadn't taken any long rides.. so now, in our traveling time they are without it, because Target will not work with us.. Hopefully Cyberhome will do the right thing.."
1,BUYER BEWARE! STOP and read before you buy!,"We bought two cyberhome DVD players for our children to watch movies for our 8 hour drive to see family. My son's broke within days, the screen went black. Not because the battery pack was drained because it was plugged into the car. Returned that one a got another one. Again, the screen went black. Cyberhome was of NO USE at all. Finally got one that worked for more than 2 movies and my daughters broke. Not dealing with this company or product anymore, refuse to give them anymore of our money. We will purchase a Sony or other name brand BUT will definitly check customer comments before buying."
1,What a headache!,"This product has been one headache after another. First, the monitor didn't work at all. After I exchanged it, the new DVD player had a battery that didn't work. When I tried to contact CyberHome about the problem, I didn't get a response. Do yourself a favor and get a different DVD player."
2,Disappointed,"This was given to me as a gift and I was very pleased at first and then I put in a classic movie and got no sound after the introduction. I at first thought it was the disc so I returned it and then got another. The same problem. I finally called customer service and was informed that they were aware of the ""glitch"" and that they had a problem with the chip no being able to read the way certain audio tracks are laid out. This problem should be fixed in the next year. I was not pleased, as how would I know which disc would play and which would not? I returned it to the local store and got another brand and now I am much happier.It does have a great carrying case though."
1,Learned My Lesson!,"I brought this useless dvd player for my 7yr old and have returned it 3 times for all the reasons listed in all of the other reviews. I wanted to save someone else the hassel of buying a pieace of junk and having to return it, Buy Name Brand!"
1,BAD TERRIBLE AND AWFUL!!!,They don't even deserve a star at all....This Portable DVD player is probably the worst thing I have bought in the past few years....After only using it a couple of times the volume cut out and now it doesn't work at all. Tried calling Cyberhome 3 times for warranty & service.....and they are no help at all!!! Don't waste your time or money on this machine.....get something else!!! I plan on reporting them to the Better Business Bureau!!
1,Piece of Junk!,Got it as a gift- NO JOKE --watched a total of 3 movies on it before it conked out!! Absolute disappoinment. Even when it did work- the battery life barely made it through 1/2 a movie. Buy name brand.
1,buyer from PA,"On third return in 90 days. This time they can keep rather than exchange. I DID read the directions and followed them so let's not assume otherwise! Won't hold battery charge, first time also had red spot on screen, can't remove battery easily in an attempt to reserve charge, on most recent exchange the open button works when and if it feels like it. Second try the dvd mechanism wouldn't stop spinning and screen couldn't be read to even try and adjust with menu. Spend a few more bucks and get a name brand. This is probably the worst electronic purchase I've ever made."
1,STOP! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,I bought this for the reason everyone bought it. It was on sale and you get more options for the money! The offer was too good to be true. First it would only spin the dvd. Then it wouldn't turn off. I bought it today and am returning it tomorrow. Spend the extra money. Your time and families happies is worth it. We are about to go on a trip. I can't imagine taking this piece of junk with us.
2,Wonderful Picture - If it is Plugged In.....,"I purchased this unit after having a 7"" Panasonic product for many years for the kids to watch when we travel. My complaints with my previous units were that the controls were difficult to work. This product is vastly superior in that category. The controls are well placed, easy to read, work wonderfully and the picture is better than my laptop and several of my televisions in my house. However, the battery is woefully inadequate. The charge will last 30 minutes, if you are lucky, even when I recharge it between flights at the airport. It is just horrible. If you are using this in the car or plugged into a socket at home or in a hotel, this is a terrific unit and the picture is phenomenal. However, if you ever want to watch it using the battery, you are better off buying something else."
2,BETTER OFF SPENDING A BIT MORE MONEY,"I bought this unit and loved it. The image quality and ease of use were terrific. It was easy to unzip the included travel bag and use it in the car for my kids to watch. I also liked that it came with a car charge, which most do not and that I could fast forward or rewind without using the remote. Unfortunately, when I had it for four days, it stopped working properly. It had trouble reading and playing discs. If I went to rewind or fast forward, it would freeze and I needed to remove the battery and unplug the unit in order to use it again. Needless to say I returned it and bought the Panasonic which I both recommend and love. The accessories that are included with this unit are great but they serve no purpose if the until itself is not reliable."
1,Thing is a no good!,"My mother boyght this DVD player for my son because we were going on a trip to Hawaii. The first one we had would stop playing for no reason. It would indicate that the battery was completely charged when in fact when I turned it on and checked the battery status, it was only half charged. In fact, the battery would never completely charge at all. So we returned that one and got another. SAME THING! So this time we are going to return it for a full refund. DO NOT BUY! You've been warned."
2,Lacking Emotion,I would like to recommend this CD single but my taste in Metal is largely that of a progressive kind. I would consider this as power metal and not particuly good power metal at that. The songs are lacking emotion and i would much rather just put on a Blind Guardian CD like nightfall in middle earth any day.
5,The best!,Judith Miller has the best antique pricing books available. I love the wonderful color pictures and the easy to read pricing! Highly recommended!
2,"One works, one failed","Purchased two of these Power2000 branded batteries for my Nikon D-40. Had both for a year, but were lightly used. One appears to have shorted as it has stopped charging (charger light doesn't even illuminate); the other is still working. Cheap - yes, but reliability in question!"
2,Not impressed.,"The story line had potential, but I wasn't impressed with this anime. My boyfriend and I bought the first volume just to see if we'd like it, and we didn't even finish it, and ended up selling it on ebay. It's not often that we won't even finish a series."
3,Mermaid Forest- Quest for Death vol. 1,"Mermaid Forest- Quest for Death sets the stage for the saga. It introduces the two main characters and their backgrounds. The history of their pasts becomes apparent in the first five miniutes of the film. More importantly, if you like eating mermaid flesh for lunch, this dvd is for you."
4,"easy to install, great lamp","Wall lamps are hard to find these days -- I only found one at Lowe's, but when I unpacked it I saw I had to hard-wire it with electrical tape (which I didn't have). So I returned it and got this, which is just what I wanted -- very easy to install (just screw it into the wall with the 4 supplied screws, add a 3-way bulb, and plug it in). It looks great and is the perfect reading lamp for over the bed."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"The very low price of this item should have been a clue. The lamp, while decently constructed, is made of extremely light weight, dare I day cheap, materials. No wonder it is priced $100 below competitors."
5,Seasons of love,"Michael at his best. Powerful voice, great lyrics, and a very dynamicentertainer. Just love this CD. A must to own."
2,Not what I expected!,"Since Michael Ball is known to me through his singing in Les Miserables (in which I thought he did a great job), I thought I would like his singing on this CD. Frankly, his rendition of the songs chosen for this CD is a bit cheesy, hard to describe but not with the emotional range I expected of him. I don't think I will ever buy another of his albums as a result."
3,Thick and thirsty! But sheds like a dog in heat...,"These are BEAUTIFUL towels--deep, rich colors! Talk about thick! For the price and free shipping, I can't believe Amazon.com made any money on these! Whenever I step out of the shower, I have a thick, thirsty, and luxurious towel awaiting me. Wow! I wish I'd gotten more of other colors.But I do have one complaint: these things shed like there's no tomorrow! I washed them twice as soon as I got them. Then I tried to use them and ended up with towel-colored fuzz all over myself. So I washed them another two times (and with some dark underwear, which was subsequently covered with towel-colored fuzz) and dried another two times. Again, I got covered with fuzz. So after a total of 6 washings and 6 dryings, they're finally tolerable. I'd hate to not have an in-home washer and dryer with these things!"
5,"Great price, towels are very big; cameo color is thicker than sage","At this price, you can't go wrong. Even after reading other reviews about these being larger than regular hand towels, I was surprised at how VERY much bigger they were. I got the cameo and sage colors. I was really surprised at how much thicker the cameo towels seemed in comparison to the sage ones. So I've ordered another pair of cameo towels."
3,Worth a look,"This is a short book helpful in small ways. Lomask has a decent popular style, although he's overly enamored of the one-sentence paragraph and the rhetorical question. Occasionally he gives questionable advice, such as when he suggests filling out a subject's early life with guesses concealed in the subjunctive (99). Lomask is best at incorporating the advice of other biographers; in fact, the reader is often left with the impression that he could have done better by reading Leon Edel and Catherine Drinker Bowen in the first place."
3,Could have been better,"I found the premise of the book to be rather intreging, but the actuall book left me with more questions than answers and left me confused.I have read some of Jude Deveraux's other work and I was disappointed with this one. The mystery I felt was really interesting, but the conclusion left me puzzeled and I felt that it could have been written better. Also except for Eden the characters where not as fleshed out leaving questions about their past through to the end of the book and are never really concluded."
2,Was this THE Jude Deveraux?,"What happened to this great storyteller?She is still a good writer, but there is no story. Since the plot is outlined elsewhere, I will detail my problems with it herewith.I was not engaged by the heroine, Eden, I strongly disliked Melissa, Eden's daughter, and never felt I got to REALLY know either of her suitors. This plot drags and stumbles and leaves the reader asking more questions than are answered! Who in their right mind would NOT dig up the buried treasure, WHO? Then the silent hero finally comes to her, after waiting a year and six weeks, why bother!Waste of my time, Montgomery Hunk or no."
4,Plenty of undocumented formats,"The description leaves some things out. A remote conrol is included, and it will play VCD, SVCD, MP3-CD and music DVD formats in addition to the ones listed. A fine unit for under $100."
1,It's Rubbish!,This is a nicely designed product and easy to use with almost no mess but the colors are terrible. If you call Dataproducts they will send you instructions on how to clean the cartridge nozzles but are not interested in the poor color quality. Save your money and buy a new HP ink cartridge as I had to do after using this product. Don't buy this product unless you enjoy disappointments and poor customer support from Dataproducts.
5,Great gift for the holidays!,My brother-in-law was thrilled with this gift (and he's Italian!).> Superfast shipping!
5,"Works Well, No Problems","All baby bottle supplies fit fine with no issues. Seems sturdy, items come out clean. No complaints."
4,good product,"I like the idea of using this in my dishwasher to keep the baby's things separate, but to be honest, I usually on use the bigger basket.."
2,Bottle Parts Don't Come Out Clean,"Why use these baskets if I have to hand-wash all the parts again? I suppose you can load a couple of items at a time and then the baskets work. The oversized nipples do not fit in the appropriate compartment. If you use the standard size (which seem to be rare nowadays) you can load 10 at a time. And if this is all you have, 10 nipples, 10 rings, the basket will be great for you. But then why would you need the extra ones? The baskets' sizes are odd to me. They don't really fit well on the top rack of my dishwasher (Bosch), widthwise. The round basket was never even used. All-in-all, I end up with washing all the parts by hand to make sure they are clean. I was tired of taking out caps and rings with milk spots, as I use Born Free bottles, which happen to have ""too many parts"" (see my other review)."
2,Not so happy,"I use Playtex DropIns bottles/nipples, which are larger than average nipples. These nipples do NOT fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket. I can only wash 3 nipples at a time in this basket. The latches to open the different compartments are very snug, making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand."
3,Works Great If You Know How to Use It,"I received this from my Amazon.com registry before my son was born. I have been using it more and more recently. At first I was confused by the medium basket and how to place the nipples into it. I use the Tommee Tippee bottles with the wide neck so I couldn't fit more then 3 across the bottom.Then I had a DUH moment and went directly to the Prince Lionheart website. [...]I was laying the nipples in the basket incorrectly and now that I see how to do it, I think I'll be able to fit more in there.The big basket works great for bottles, tops, pacifiers, small toys, etc. The valve basket is great for those small valves in sippy cups. It keeps them all in one place so that they aren't flying around.My one gripe is the lack of any kind of instructions or pictures which has led to some confusion on how to place items in the basket. The medium basket isn't intuitive at all with the nipple placement."
3,Good quality but dimensions are TOTALLY off.,"I had seen other wooden knife storage trays in stores but didn't buy because they were too wide for the drawer space I had. The dimensions stated in the discription worked for what I needed, but unfortunately when it arrived it was WAY off (try 4 1/2 inches). I ended up carving up my drawer organizer & making it work, but still I wouldn't have ordered it originally if they had supplied the true width."
1,Quality Item Now Defective,"I bought one in oak months ago that is a quality item. Perfect for a few knives in a drawer or for moving knives safely. The only drawback is that knives with a protruding lower finger guard do not seat correctly. However, another one I ordered recently in Beech was obviously defective: slats were not spaced correcly on the dowels and a jagged knot would scratch your hand (I sent it back). It is too bad that a company like Wusthof that has spent years building a good reputation would ruin it by putting their name on items sold with no quality control and that Amazon would ship such an obviously defective product."
5,great knife block,I really like this in the drawer knife block. I switched to this from the regular counter top block because my littlest kid is a serious climber and way to interested in things ;) So I put this one in the drawer and then put a child safety latch on the drawer. Works great!-Happy Mama
3,Pretty nice...,"It was 1/4"" too long for my drawer so i can't use it where i wanted to. Make sure to check your dimensions. Otherwise the material and quality seems pretty good. You can put virtually any size knife in any of the various slots."
5,"And ideal solution, compact and well-made","Like many others, I have seriously limited counter space and prefer not to use up real estate with a bulky counter-style knife block. When I ran across this storage tray, I worried that the knives wouldn't be as accessible or well protected, but figured it was worth a try. And it really is a great solution - this tray fits perfectly in slim drawers, the knives nestle perfectly in the slots, and it's still very easy to grab just the knife I need at a glance. Given the high price of Wusthof knives, I was happy to see a tray that was reasonably priced and yet stored and protected the knives so effectively. Highly recommended."
4,Most everything you'd expect,"What you see is pretty much what you get. The dimensions listed seem accurate and it nicely holds a chefs knife, carving knife, paring knife, and 4 steak knifes. Its attractive and seems stable as well. My only issue is that the inside of the groves aren't sanded smooth. This can cause some catching and dulling of blades."
4,Knife Organization - Safe and Easy,"I use this product in my kitchen drawer. It replaced the snap open knife sheaths that I was using. I can readily get the knife I need and don't have to shuffle through a pile, etc. Fits neatly, great quality."
4,"Quality product, as expected","Nothing to get too excited about but this fits in my fairly shallow knife drawer, does the job very well. Solid, smooth wood."
5,Great!,"This fit perfectly in our drawer, and was exactly as described! Our knives are fitting well in it, and I LOVE the freed up counter space that it provides."
1,Wrong size,"Product info said that it was 15.9"" long, but it's actually 17"" long so it didn't fit in my 16.5"" drawer. I ended up returning it."
1,BOO!!!!!,"I think that this is the worst book that I have read. This story was crappy. It had some potential, but nothing came of it. Vanessa is whiney, immature, childish, annoying and selfish. The problems that she had with Parker to make her so scared are never clear. She never wants to talk about it or even think about it, so you never know what happened and what whe did talk about was not really all that bad to actually scare a woman. I though Nick was areally good guy. Why he stuck around for any of that is anyones guess. I liked Rodney. He was cool. And being that this is the first book that I have read by Linda, it does not give a good out look. The other reviews say that this is not her usual style and usually her books are not so crappy. I hope so. This wins the award of ""Worst book read....EVER"". Yep, its that bad."
1,A little light,"An exploration of the deeper differences between two men (ex-husband and new lover) who were externally the same (jocks and playboys) would have been interesting, but this book offered no insight and was very light on character development. As a baseball fan I was also disappointed that Ms. Miller did not seem to do any research. The sports press always identifies a major league picther by handedness -- it's as natural as breathing, 'Lefty Parker Lawrence' or 'big right-handed Parker Lawrence'; plus she had the press comparing him to ""Hank Aaron and Pete Rose"" -- both known as hitters which an American League pitcher would not be: How about pitchers like Sandy Koufax or the more modern (and American League) Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez or Dwight Gooden? Ms. Miller, don't forget women readers can be baseball fans too."
1,love the author; hate the book,"I normally love Linda Lael Miller, but I really hated this book. I thought it was totally unbelievable. How could the heroine, who's so fearful of men in general and professional athletes in particular, sleep with a football player almost immediately? The dialogue between them was just silly. There was no ""get-to-know-you"" chat. The hero started talking like her therapist right from the beginning, telling her to take it easy, go slow, don't be so afraid. Anyway, I ended up just skimming through the book, skipping page after page. I would have rather reread almost any of her other books than waste my time with this one."
1,one of the worst!,"I started reading this book earlier today, I thought it was going to be an enjoyable read seeing that I liked other Linda Lael Miller books, but this one was a total washout! As another reviwer points out the main charecter, Vanessa, who just went through a horrible divorce and is fearful of all men slightly resembling her husband in any way immediatly falls for another Jock just like her ex. The next day they are joging together and are acting like lovers. This new man, Nick, is the one that is in controll of the entire relationship. Vanessa is shallow and has no charecter at all, all her friends seem to know what is best for her and she follows this, she has no backbone, or should I say brains at all! The converstation was dull, the charecters shallow, and the plot was horrible. I would not suggest this book to anybody!"
1,Pass on this,We love good tea and coffee. This product was nasty. I used four to five bags in each cup and still counldn't get a strong enough taste. I am used to drinking anise tea. This is not worht the price. Pass on it.
2,Meade Astro Finder,I purchased this kit to use with my Meade DS 2090 AT-TC Telescope. I also purchased the Meade USB to RS232 Cable since my laptop does not have a serial port. I have tried multiple times to get the AutoStar software that came with the telescope to recognize the the computer without success. I called Meade's customer support and they indicated that I need to 505 cable kit even though the information on Amazon's site said that the 506 cable kit is for the DS 2000 series telescopes. The customer support person did make some suggestions that I will follow when I get home from work. The software that came with the 506 kit is not that easy to follow and unfortunately Meade does not include a written instruction manuel with the software. They could have done a better job if they had provided comprehensive instructions with the 506 cable kit. I will follow up once I try the instructions given to me by their technical support staff.
2,Not too hot,"Ok, maybe we're spoilt a bit by the great early music ensembles around today, but I have to say thatthis recording is very disappointing and doesn't come close to ones by such groups as Pro Cantione Antiqua. It features Alfred Deller at his most idiosyncratic, which is fine in his best repertoire (lutesongs, etc.), but which can be quite excruciating in ths recording. It may not be helped by the way thay were all miked, as there is a lot of Deller and a bit of a mush made of everyone else. One plus to come out of it, though, is the voice of his on, Mark, singing alto and tenor at different times (made possible by transposition from the usual keys). It sounds like a lighter version of Alfred at his most lyrical and smooth. One wonders why he didn't make more of a name for himself as a countertenor."
3,Videonow Jr Video,Was a great deal. Just didnt come with the videos that I expected and were on the cace inclosed. Because it was for a gift and in good shape no reason to send back or complain. Just would have like to get what I thought I was purchacing.
5,We all need to learn more about enzymes,"We can all use help in understanding enzymes. They control every aspect of our body from the digestion of our foods to the loss of our hair. For years i have been taking food enzymes with my meals. I really feel like they are helping me.This book claims that the older we get, the less enzymes our body manufactures. This being said, i feel like we need to help our body with this problem by taking supplements.There is is talk that enzymes might prevent cancer since they help us better handle our foods. There still needs to be more research on cancer, to determine what role enzymes play in the prevention of it.I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
2,not worth the minimal cost,"Buyer Beware. This is a pamphlet, not a book, and contains information readily available on the internet, but not the information I was looking for. I paid little for it, and am still sorry that I paid anything for it. Wish I had looked into my purchase more carefully."
1,UNSAFE for Small Animals,"::PLEASE READ::I don't usually review products but this made me infuriated. I own two chinchillas and I was looking for a new hideaway for them. I was really excited to receive this product because of the design with the little windows. Upon opening the box I was disappointed. If I could give it less than one star, I would.First, the Prevue Hendryx website advertises this product as ""solid wood."" LIE. This is made of glued together particle board.Then, there is the issue of the glue. Tons of wood glue and some of it exposed.The ""wood"" around the edges and holes was so rough and splintered and needed sanding.The worse part of all is that the entire thing is put together with metal nails. In fact, my hut has two sharp metal nails exposed on the inside.IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR ANIMALS - JUST A LITTLE BIT - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
5,THE MOST AMAZING COOKBOOK I'VE EVER SEEN,Not only are the recipes easy to follow but the book is beautiful! The stories of Ms. Abadi's family are heart warming and funny. I have two - one to cook from and one to put out on my table. A must have for anyone who loves cooking!
5,One of Sally's Best!,"This is truly one of Sally's best full albums. Produced by Gunther Mende, who was hot at the time producing for the Superstar, Jennifer Rush.Power of Love: Best of Jennifer RushHe also did a fantastic comeback album for Helen SchneiderBack On Trackaround that time. Sally's music has magic in it. Mystical in content, sweeping, layered vocals and intense depth to her lyrics. There is a lot of old-world charm in her delivery and her serious spirituality is evident. This is my favorite CD, other than Three Rings, which is a masterpiece.Three RingsIf you like, Sally, be sure to check out Maggie Reilly, Mike Oldfield's session singer. Same producers.The Best of Maggie Reilly: There and Back Again"
4,Reminiscence of 1978,"We can consider Three Rings as the remix of Water Bearer. Words and music seems to be a new version of that wonderful album, but, of course, the result is different. The Blessing, Survival, Summer In My Hand are very beautiful songs, and Digging For Gold or Summer of Love are commercial track released as singles. Is a good album but not the best 90's work for Mrs Oldfield."
4,Childhood memories of Sally Oldfield,"My dad recently sent me this album from the UK to remind us of good times. We listened to Sally Oldfield when I was in primary school (in the 80's) and ""Three Rings"" is about as close as we can get to ""Waterbearer"" on CD. It's wonderful - full of soul and very soothing. I play it in my car as a remedy for road rage. Listen especially to ""Summer in my Hand"" and try and stay in a blue mood (it's impossible). Thanks Dad!!"
5,Energizing club track!,"This sleeper hit has an incredible ten remixes. Probably the best mix is ""Stoney's Lesson 4 Radio"". When I play this towards the end of the week it definitely gets me ""Ready for the Weekend"". This is club material that is definitely worth mixing in with other house anthems. The different remixes can be used for different club settings. Get it!"
1,torture device?,"Buy these if you never want to where them. They hurt. Get the previous version, more comfortable MDRG56V model while sellers still have them."
5,I love these Headphones,I don't know what I'm going to do when the supply runs dry. Don't have the ears for plugs and I love having the volume control at my finger tips.
1,"be carefull , this it for turbo model ( GST AND GSX )","i bought this fuel regulator and didnt work on my mitsubishi eclipse 99 rs(420A), so i wrote to standard motor products and they told me that some mitsubishi eclipse use a standard fuel regulator PR328.I wought the PR328 and its exactly like the oem part , so be carefull when you are buying replacement parts for your car."
4,If you like Lilecks...,"Finally got around to reading Lilecks early novel and I really enjoyed it. I regularly read Lilecks' blog, so the writing style was very familiar. If you like Lilecks, you will like this book."
3,PLEASE fix the formatting problems!,"I liked the story, the characters, the writing... but the abysmal formatting made liking a struggle. I would read the book again and would probably enjoy it much, much more if an updated version with reasonable formatting were made available. PLEASE fix the formatting!"
3,Good Read but Rife with Typos and Lacks Paragraph Formatting,"A very funny and enjoyable read but it (Kindle version) is full of typos and has no paragraph formatting. Some of the typos are so severe that the meaning of the sentence is lost. In addition, the lack of paragraph formatting often has me struggling to follow conversations."
4,Story - great. Book - not so much.,"I have been a fan of Mr. Lileks for several years and I follow his blog and his Newspaper work. He is a funny guy with an irreverent attitude, a keen eye for human failures, and a refreshing lack of whatever it is that caused most writers to believe that they are sitting (or should be sitting) on a pedestal far above the common crowd.a funny, well written story.Unfortunately the e-book is full of misprints and glitches. A little more care should have been taken when it was converted from print to electronic media."
4,Wusthof Ceramic Sharpener,"I have had this sharpener for over 5 years. It keeps my knives sharp, it really just takes the burrs off that a steel would and only works on good edges. Don't expect it to make a mistreated knife into a superb cutting instrument."
3,Two different sounds should have been layed out better,"For the most part Damned fans come in two flavors. We have your ""punk"" and ""gothic"" fans, both with great love for the group. This Cd tries to fuse both into a greatest hit package, but for the most part fails.The actual compilation isn't bad, but the songs are scattered leaving no good transition in between songs. Having a classic like ""Neat Neat Neat"" followed by their most sophisticated (in my opinion) song in ""Alone Again Or"" is just plain weird. A personal beef I have are the new ""mix"" versions, they ruin the original sound I grew to appreciate. What should have been done was to split the compiliation into their early punk and goth era's. Disc One would cover the early work, while the second disc will feature their later more polished sound. The CD and it's songs earn a 4.5, but the actual compilation's arrangement erases a star or two."
3,Scattershot Collection,"There is no rhyme or reason to this collection. If it was in chronological order it would at least make more sense. I think I got mine when there still wasn't much out on CD yet, at least domestically by the cool underground groups, so having any Damned for my newfangled CD player (all us real punks still love our vinyl best!!!)was better than no Damned at all. Of course the early stuff is still the bomb and all the fans know Machine Gun Etiquette was their zenith. In fact, if you pick up the first 4 albums, that's really all The Damned you need. Their later cheesey attempt at goth yielded a few good numbers but pales (no pun intended) in comparison. There are too many weak later cuts on this collection. They should have stuck to the real meat and potatos."
5,Looking for a CD to add to your swing collection? THIS IS IT,"My radio show features swing music and this is one of my favorite CD's. There are a lot of fun tracks on this discs from excellent originals to jazzed up standards. The tracks I play the most are Angelina/ZoomaZooma, I have a Way with Women, and Givin' Up Givin' up but all the tracks are strong. Ray has been putting out good music for quite a while and this disc is no exception. If you're looking for another disc to add to your collection or want to give swing a try--pick this one up...you won't be disappointed."
4,I'd buy it again,"I know Kashi advertises this bar as a cookie, but I use them as a meal replacement when I'm in a hurry and can't eat a regular meal and want to stay away from fast food. This bar keeps me feeling full and satisfied until my next meal, and unlike many meal replacement bars, this one has very good flavor and texture so you really feel like you're eating something substantial. It contains 280 calories, 5g fat, 13g protein, and 6g fiber which I feel is a good combination. The bar does contain 49g of carbs and 33g sugars which is much higher than I would normally eat for a meal (maybe that's why they call it a cookie bar), but that fact doesn't bother me since it is full of healthy ingredients that are good for the body and I'm not eating a bar every day. I have turned into a big Kashi fan and buy quite a few of their products because they are natural, taste good and are good for you. P.S. If you haven't tried their new trail mix cookies, you're missing out."
5,One Of The Few Good Kashi Bars Left,Healthy ingredients and value for your money. The oatmeal bar is healthy and fills you up; same amount of calories as other bars yet satisfies your hunger. If only Kashi would change the recipes back to the original quality for their other bars.
5,Yummy,I recently discovered the Kashi GoLean protein bars and as far as protein bars go they are the best tasting IMO.I especially like the oatmeal raisin one as it reminds me of the oatmeal raisin cookies I had as a kid witht the frosting on the bottom. Of course these are a bit healthier for you than the cookies and maybe they don't taste quite as good but would you really expect a protein bar to taste like a cookie? :)
5,If you like Oatmeal Raisin Cookies you'll love this!,"I love chocolate, but this bar is really very good. Much better than I thought it would be. My 2 year old son thinks it is the most delicious thing he's ever eaten!"
5,great tasting -- very sweet like a cookie,these are really good... taste is like an oatmeal rasin cookie covered with a white sweet frost...
1,Wave a skunk in front of these bars!,THese bars were horrible. The worst tasting and looking bar that Kashi makes. I would suggest buying any of the other bars but not these.
5,Great tasting protein bar with solid nutritional profile,"I like using protein bars for breakfasts on the go and as meal supplements, so I'm always looking to find new ones that are healthy AND taste great. Kashi's GOLEAN bar in the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor is my latest discovery. The tasty bar really is reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie, with a similar chewy texture. It also offers 13 grams of protein--not as high as some sports-marketed bars, but still very good--and a whopping 6 grams of fiber (more than All Bran bars!). An added bonus is the 10% RDA of Calcium, and finally, like all Kashi products, these bars are made with seven whole grains. Definitely a recommended addition to any healthy diet!"
3,Cookie Dough Yogurt?,"I was not expecting it, but this bar has what seems to be a watered-down yogurt coating.The bar tastes fairly decent, but I wouldn't exactly call it oatmeal raisin. It has a distinct raw cookie dough flavoring to it. There doesn't seem to be much oatmeal taste.There are plenty of other bars out there with less fat (and FAR less saturated fat) that actually taste better. This is a quality bar, no doubt, as are all Kashi products, but I would not care to use it as a meal replacement on a daily basis."
3,OK,The flavour and texture of this is just OK. Nothing great but not bad either. It tastes somewhat like raw cookie dough with yogurt coating. A little too sugary for me personally.Cheers
3,Not as good as others,"This particular GOLEAN bar is not as good as the others in my opinion. It has too much of a spice taste for me. That mixed with the signature sweetness of the GOLEAN bar doesn't make this one my favorites. It is, however, full of plump raisins and is soft and chewy like an oatmeal cookie. If you like really sweet spiced oatmeal raisin cookies than you would enjoy this, though."
3,Not size stated. Kashi Golean Bar,Kashi Golean Bar Oatmeal Raisin.This product was advertised as 2.75 Bar. The bar size I received was 1.94....Big difference.The bar is the one that I have ordered from a different site and the one I really like.Just disappointed in the misstatement about the size of the bar for the price I paid.
2,Not Helpful,This book might help k-6 graders but is too basic for much older than that. It really doesn't help much with standardized testing. It's more about basic ideas like getting a good nights sleep and being organized. I skimmed it and haven't opened it since.
5,Most Helpful for My Accounting and Auditing Groups,As the CFO of a privately held company looking to go public in the next few years this is what we needed to focus our compliance and governance programs.
2,paper soldiers,"the movie was a bit childish, but amusing. very disappointed that staceydash is suppose to be a leading actor and yet i don't believe she has more then a total of five scenes for about four minutes of acting.overall would not purchase this film."
4,Kevin Hart is Hilarious,"I actually give it 4 and a half stars. I love Kevin Hart he is a funny dude. I want to see him more in a lot of more movies. I have him on comedy tapes because he started out as a stand up comedian, but if i could write some stuff for him I would cuz he can bring it to life. Paper Soldiers was one of the funniest movies that I have seen with a lot of rappers in it. It had a lot of cussing but besides that I was crying laughing. If you like his stand up comedy then you'll like im in this, soul plane, and anything else he play in. Watch and I guarantee will will find a little humor or funny laugh to it."
2,BEANIE NO ICE CUBE- THE OTHER DUDE NO CHRIS TUCKER,"Wouldnt we all love to make a ghetto movie as funny as Friday starring a hood comedian as funny as Chris Tucker? but instead of that formaula, dude was straight up annoying! I would even take mike epps. save yourselves. there are no worse actors than at da roc!!and please get bleek in the studio!!"
3,PAPER SOLDIERS,"KEVEIN HART IS A FUNNY DUED. THAT'S JUST MY OPINION, BUT PAPER SOLDIERS WAS A OKAY MOVIE. IT'S NOT THE BEST BUT IT'S JUST OKAY.DON'T LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIE "" TOO MUCH CUSSING""BEANIE SIEGEL WAS HILARIOUS. BUT THE GUY THAT KEPT SWEATING IN THE MOVIE HAD ME ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING, HE GOT HIMSELF IN TROUBLE. BELIEVE ME YOU GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE IT'S GOT SOME FUNNY PARTS IN IT."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!,"This book is one of the best books I have ever read! Being a rodeo girl myself, I enjoyed the truth to the storyline and the excitement! If only there were more books like this one!"
1,Shipping rip off...,"$1.99 for the ink cartridges, but $25 for the shipping? This is not even over nite. It's standard shipping that will take 12 days to get to me. I should have suspected something when I e-mailed tdp_ink, and never got an answer.Bad on me for not following my instincts, bad on tdp_ink for gouging the customer.Turns out they list each cart as one pound each. A pound? A full soda can is 12 ounces, and there are 16 ounces in a pound. If I had a pound of ink, I could go a year or two without having to buy ink for my home printer. Can't recommend tdp_ink. Take your business elsewhere."
4,Fun Animation Yet...,"a tad more brash than Girlfriends. This is a great formula, if only it was longer; even if each episode was 15 min. as oppose to 5 min. A couple of years ago I enjoyed viewing Sista 'N the City on-line. I am most happy now to see just how far the creators have expanded. Showtime playing this right after Soul Food is great timing for those who never saw these ""shortakes"" before.Although each Sista brings here own brand of politics to the table (man problems, career issues, family drama, etc.) they are always there for each other in the end. Even at 5 min. a piece, you will definitely laugh each time!! :-)"
2,I Could Have Watched Commercials,"I purchased the DVD and wish I had purchased the worlds funniest, longest, most boring commercials instead. The episodes were not well thought out and extremely short, the animation was one step above stick figures and claymation, and the dialog was choppy. Each teeny, tiny episode had some sexual innuendo to it, even where there was no need or interest. I would not recommend this to anyone, not even to borrow. If the author should by chance read this, please recognize the average adults' attention span is longer than five minutes. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I am glad someone recognizes black women would like entertainment that reminds them of self."
4,LOVE IT or...HATE IT!!!,"Wifey and I was definitely feeling Sistas 'N the City. This is not an Academy Award feature and nor do I expect it to be. It's entertaining black female urban situations that you can relate to in your professional and social interactions. It's real, it's raw with a comedic twist. What I hate about Sistas 'N the City was the ending. The ending wouldn't be so bad if there were a sequel? Lighten up, think outside the box, and enjoy it!"
4,Great Send Up of Those Other Women in That Other Town,"My only complaint about Sistas 'N The City is that the episodes are too short. I always enjoy this raucous take on city life from the perspective of a few black women. They are not archetypal black women, nor does the creator try to make them so. They are just four sistas whose worldview is featured on this hilarious DVD collection."
1,Nancy Drew~ Mystery of the Diamond Triangle,I didn't like it at all! I hated the ending. I thought it could be so much better. It is so bad compared to all the other ones in the series.
4,Very watchable,"very watchable in this episode Nancy (Pamela Sue Martin) sees a car go off the road into a ditch from a glider she is flying, but when the police don't find a car Nancy with the help of George and Ned (Jean Rasey, George O'Hanlon) investigate and find them self's in trouble with a stolen car ring"
4,The Diamond Triangle with Nancy Drew and a Pick,the children of today are still reading the material of yesterlorn and i am Thrilled. I grew up on this work and amgoing to furnish it for my grand daughter as she will beschooled strick Catholick and a small mixture of jew.I think she will enjoy the relationship of the Doctor Fatherand the excitement of friends and adventures.
5,Get lost in the Bermuda Triangle . . .,"Though I don't usually read Harlequins, I've always really enjoyed the 'More Than Men' series of books they publish. _Neptune's Bride_ is one of the best I've read from this series! Not only does it give an interesting explanation for the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon, it has two wonderful characters who play well off each other. Jase is wildly sexy and mysterious and Geneva is so funny as the scientist who tries to analyze the unexplainable. And, the sea creatures with their *very* unique personalities will leave you smiling! I was hooked from the first. It pulled me right in and wouldn't let go. You'll find yourself finishing this easily in one sitting."
4,Good first effort,"This is a pretty good book. I found myself drawn into the characters, and as a single Christian I found a lot of Ashley Wilkes Stockingdale's misadventures very familiar. A lot of the negative reviews seem to be from people who were not aware that this was a Christian chick-lit book, which is unfortunate. It is not perfect, the writing is at times clunky and unnatural. However, I can see both Christians and Non-Christians liking the book if they are into the genre as a whole."
3,Something to think about,"I found this book on a news website and thought to check it out on Amazon. I was amazed to find the first 2 chapters on Amazon and read it right away. I immediately found myself laughing at the people and scenarios because they could easily mirror my life right now. That being said, I am grateful for the time to laugh at myself and my friends through reading the first two chapters, but if you are looking for an excellent book on being a Christian woman who's single, I would recommend Carolyn McCulley's new book, ""Did I Kiss Marriage Goodbye?"" She's honest and she's real about living the day to day life of faith in God who is sovereign and good."
3,Not bad but not great....,"This book was fairly entertaining, but I must admit that Ashley's snottiness was a problem for me. She is so convinced she's the world's greatest Christian, but she seems to look down on everyone, including everyone in her Christian singles group, the secretaries at work, and anyone who drives anything less than an Audi. That doesn't seem too Christian to me. The book is fairly funny, not laugh out loud hilarious but amusing enough, but the main character is just a little bit too snobbish to really make it enjoyable."
2,Ashley is the World's Greatest Christian,"Ashley is The World's Greatest Christian in Silicon Valley! She will tell you so herself within the very first pages of the book - and keep telling you how wonderful & Christian she is as she shops at Prada & Ann Taylor in her Audi TT convertible.I got very tired of the snottiness, hypocrisy, and very superior attitude of Ashley. She judges everyone in her life as inferior while she's God's Chosen One. So shallow and critical of others - what a great example of a Christian in the world."
2,"Cute, but...","I like chick lit and I've been reading more Christian women's fiction lately, but this book just left me cold. I felt like Ashley's Christianity was just kind of ""tacked-on"" like that was supposed to be her quirk - some heroines are heavy, some are klutzy, and she's Christian. I don't think that a Christian has to wear sackcloth and ashes, but the constant name-dropping and looking down at everyone didn't seem very Christian to me. By the way, I don't think anyone in the Silicon Valley would be that surprised that her brother met a Chinese-American woman - last time I looked, Northern California is a pretty multi-cultural place. Some of the book was very funny, but overall it just didn't work."
4,Fabulous!,"I loved this book and can't wait to read the others in the series. A friend gave it to me as a gift because the main character's name is Ashley just like me. Anyway, it was a super funny and easy read -- I finished it in one night. It is definitely similar to the Shopaholic series, which I am a huge fan of -- but it is nice to read a funny and entertaining story with a Christian perspective. I would recommend this to women of pretty much any age, either single or married."
3,a fun but fluffy read,"If you're looking for good literary Christian fiction that's spiritually deep and makes you think, keep looking. If you're looking for something full of fluff and fun to read in the bath or on the beach, this novel and its sequel are great.I could sometimes relate to Ashley and enjoyed the book and getting to know the characters, but all the obnoxious brand name-dropping and pop culture references really got annoying and made Ashley seem incredibly shallow and superficial, not to mention vain and self-absorbed. Maybe that was the point, but I expected that at some point she would realize the conflict between following Christ and following the world and that she would be more concerned about being a slave to righteousness than a slave to fashion.In the chick lit genre, I prefer the Robin Jones Gunn's Sisterchicks series and Neta Jackson's Yada Yada Prayer Group series."
3,This is book #1!,"First of all, this is book number ONE.NOT book #3. Read this one first.The book's cute. It's /not/ heady or intellectual, per se, but it's cute and fun. Enjoy!"
2,Lacking...,"Despite clever and witty writing, the story line lacks much to be desired. A woman who is absolutely desperate to be married is not exactly my cup of tea. I love contemporary Christian fiction, but this was just LAME!!!"
5,"What a minute, this is wrong!","Hey,They put these books in the wrong order!1: What a girl wants2:She's out of control3: With this ring, I'm confusedAnyway, It's a wonderful book, none the less!"
3,What a Girl Wants,"Apparently I have read this book and didn't remember it, so that's probably not a great sign.It's not a very exciting book, and there is not a whole lot that made me want to keep reading. I like books that are so good I can't put them down. This definitely was not one of those. Part of it may have been because I've read it before, so I remembered random parts.However, it's still a cute storyline. I enjoyed the book, and actually look forward to reading the other two books in the series.The book is kind of frustrating, because it seems very drawn out. She is constantly gong back and forth between guys. It does have a cute ending that makes up for it though. I'm interested to see how the next books will continue the story."
2,Always complaining,"This character is so whiny that I wasn't even able to finish the book b/c I found her so annoying. It wouldn't even had mattered if she did redeem herself at some point in the book b/c I found this character so unlikeable that I couldn't root for her. It made my stomach churn with disgust as every sentene was complaint after complaint. Save yourself the time and money and skip this book and it's series as it will only make you feel depressed that this ever made it from the editing desk to be bought buy readers. I have to cheer myself up after reading such a horrible book, this is disappointing b/c I liked this authors spa girls novels. Very sad!"
3,Sort of snobby and aggravating,"i thought that the description of this book made it look so cute -- i am also an attorney so i thought i would really relate. i was willing to give the whole christian genre a chance...let me just say the book was pretentious. i was annoyed by all her high powered attorney references and the fact she seemed really hypocritical. still, i read the book and thought it was okay/cute, but not okay enough to read any other books by this author or in this series. i gave the book to my friend from mississippi, who is actually a more devoted christian, and she couldnt get through the book because she was soo annoyed. if you read this, expect to ignore your annoyances and just read it to pass the time while laying on some beach somewhere...You will want to know what happens, if you can manage to get into the book."
3,Great book for single Christian girls!,"I really enjoyed What a Girl Wants, and found myself sympathizing with Ashley in her challenges as a single Christian woman. I myself am young and married and liked it, but I have single friends I would more highly recommend this book too. The book didn't just enrapture me and pull me in to where I couldn't stop reading (but maybe that was because I couldn't relate as well). Still, it was cute and light-hearted. I might read the second one, just to find out what Ashley's up to now."
2,Weird racist overtones?,"I too am excited about the burgeoning genre of Christian Chick-lit, and I did enjoy Ms. Billerbeck's work. But what troubles me is the racist comments included throughout the book. When the older brother announces he is marrying a woman from China, the main character makes a crack to him saying, Did you meet her at the Immigration office.This kind of comment is not acceptable, ever. But particularly not so for a Christian. I was disappointed."
3,?Christian novel,"This started out being a fun novel about Christian dating. But, as I read-I don't see what makes it Christian. Other than a casual reference or two about a Bible study, the main character-Ashley-is very superficial & materialistic. Other than that-there didn't seem to be any depth to most of the characters in her book. I'm just glad that I didn't spend full price for the book."
3,Just okay,"Glad I bought it...like my more expensive ones better.PROS:Its the only yellow set in my hospital so nobody will steal it without being caughtReally easy to hear heart, lungs, gut sounds.GREAT for tiny patientsCONS:Its uncomfortable for the earsIt looks cheap (Mostly the metal parts)"
2,i dont like it,this phone the lg ke780 shine is indeed a pretty phone but.internet dosent work.you can not send or recieve multimedia messeges..no sending pic or recieveing them either .it is an international phone so the service sucks..i never have any bars i go into my bathroom and it says no service emergency calls only.i have at&t my old motorola crappy phone has better reception then this brand new lg shine ..hey it has some cool ringtones though.
2,Not compatible,Great looking phone and nifty features. Too bad it doesn't work with my AT&T service. Good thing Amazon accepts returns.
5,Happy Customer,The phone is good looking and the product is good.Amazon's customer service is excellence - five stars.
2,not for U.S. market,"this is a good phone except its designed for the over seas area, itdoesn.t work well with at&t; does work better for t-mobile, phone will roam to t-mobile network"
1,khoi from Dallas Tx,"I purchase this phone for my friend and just have it almost 2 two week .The phone start having trouble when you push it up to talk ,the power went off and i have to turn back the power again ,just happen very often .Phone look nice but i very disappoint the way it happen.I would not recommended buying this product ."
3,Just okay,"While I wouldn't say this phone is bad, I don't love it. When talking, I often hear feedback, or myself echoing back. Also, you can't set the alarm, turn off the phone, and have the alarm go off. Therefore, the battery drains faster if you want to turn it off at night. The joystick is hard to use to maneuver through the menus. I do think the camera works fairly well."
1,LG Shine KE970,"Weak. Overall poor performance with voice, text and total functionality. ""coolness"" of shine-- not worth it. LG phone not good"
4,verry good but,this is a verry good deal it does work with my network (t-mobile) the only thing is the internet needs to be set by your carrier. the camera has a great picture and its a good phone to use. the roller bar is a little sensitive and you cant change it either. the mp3 player is great. all in all its a good phone for the price.
4,A good probability and stats book,"There really are only a few connections to baseball, and even fewer on the field. However the author does a good job of explaining basic principles of probabilty. There are some good chapters about lotteries and other random games. Overall, a worthy book."
2,Swing and a miss,"Useless if you are looking for a book about sabermetric analysis. The first chapter starts off great, explaining basic tools to evaluate hitter performance. From there, the book does a 180 and instead focuses on an introductory to probability theory, with little to no tie to actual baseball. It's disjointed and has little to no human commentary (it almost reads like a textbook for many stretches). If you're looking for sabermetric analysis, there's many better sources, and if you're looking for a probability theory textbook, there's many better sources.Chapter One was useful though... only reason this gets 2 stars."
3,Not enough baseball to satisfy...,"I seem to recall taking some freshmen math class from Professor Ross back in my days at the University of Oregon, but the details of that class remain as unmemorable as this book. If you already have a reasonable knowledge of basic probability, it's unlikely that you'll learn much here. His treatment of baseball betting in Chapter 4 is just about the most obvious idea imagineable (bet on underdogs) and not suprisingly doesn't work all that well. His analysis seems just to skim the surface of a very deep and complex game. There just isn't much to satisfy."
5,A purposeful introduction to probability,This book perpetrates a wonderful trick. The author presents a number of engaging questions in the context of baseball and gambling. Then before you can put the book down you have been taken through some fundamental concepts of probability without being aware that the book is teaching something that looks suspiciuosly like math. The concepts are presented at a level that requires some focus but challenges the reader to come away with a real sense of accomplishment. I enjoyed the book thoroughly.
3,Uses baseball to illustrate freshman statistics,"Not intended as comprehensive statistical study of baseball. Rather, its goal is to teach a few of the freshman probability-statistics concepts via baseball examples. This may be too narrow a niche to appeal to many readers. But if you want such a book, this is a well written and easy to read one. Has several useful nuggets for the teacher (Derek Jeter and David Justice exemplifying Simpson's paradox; analysis of streaks data; analysis of a cute gambling strategy ""bet on underdog whose fan base is relatively very small"") and useful references to further statistical work on baseball."
2,Too Little Baseball,"Only about 20% of this book is about baseball. If the author didn't have his own agenda, it could have been closer to 80 or 90%. The best parts of the book are Appendix 1 (almost all SABR material) and the annotated bibliography. A good idea squandered."
2,Not sure who the intended audience is,"I have an extensive math background and found this book tough to read. Not because the math described is particularly complicated (it is most definitely not...high school algebra is sufficient), but because Ross' writing style is too verbose. 99% of readers should know the meaning of ""average,"" yet Ross devotes a lot of text to explaining this concept. I'm not sure who his audience is. Math-savvy people may feel that concepts have been dumbed-down and over explained, but math-phobic people may be scared off by the use of formulas...and the majority of times they aren't really needed anway."
4,"No-frills, straightforward guide.","This handy, concise manual helps those interested in brushing their writing styles to build reference lists of common proofreading adjustments. First the author covers daily writing problems related to fat, inconsistency and failure to keep parallel grammatical constructions. Then, in part II, he presents an A-Z word and phrase list to cut, change and compare. ""Edit Yourself"" is a must-have desk companion."
1,Not worth the money,"This knife set is not worth even the discounted price and should be rated less than 1 star! Knives that you can get at the ""dollar store"" are better than this set!They do not hold an edge, are impossible to sharpen and rust horribly even when dried immediately after washing. I have even taken them to a professional sharpening service and they could not get a good edge on them! The blades of the larger knives are too thick to be useful. The shears were rusted shut out of the box, had they not been a gift I would have returned them immediately.I do not suggest you purchase this brand of knife even for the good price as you will just be replacing them shortly anyway."
3,Not a bad EVERYDAY SET,"I got this set through a Gold Box deal on Amazon. I have a large set of Wusthof that I baby all the time. My wife is not a ""knife person"" and uses glass cutting boards, tosses my Wusthof's in the bottom of the sink(!), etc.I'm giving this set to her, so I don't have to worry about them being abused.As for the knives themselves, they are not up to the standard of say Henckle International (consumer line) or some of the other lower end, department store lines. But, I paid under the cost of a burger combo meal at McD's for a 14 piece set. So, for that amount they are a GREAT value.BTW, there is a difference between honing steels. Just like blade steel, handle material etc in cutting utensils, there are high and low quality honing steels. To handle soft metal like this set of knives is made of, the hone doesn't have to be and isn't as good of quality as an F. Dick, Wusthof, Henckles, or even a higher end Sabatier knife set."
1,Not the Sabatier I know,"Caveat emptor.This is a very inexpensive knife set, some would say cheap. The knives are made in China and are not the same kind or quality of knives I have bought from Sabatier before. The manufacturer's box (not the shipping carton from Amazon.com) came with a large hole in it and one knife had a rusted scratch on it.If you want or need inexpensive, this is surely that, and you may be satisfied with the set. But if you want Sabatier's fine knives, these are NOT them. In this, as in most else, you get what you pay for. A single fine Sabatier knife would you usually run the same price they ask for this entire set.To iterate, if you just want some inexpensive knives, you may be satisfied with the set. If you want and expect more from Sabatier you will most likely be disappointed.P.S. Personally, I am returning the set. I don't need cheap."
1,This is the worse set of knifes I have ever bought,these were dull out of the box and they are all rusting. Very disappointed in this purchase save your money and get a better set.
1,Why only one star?,"I usually hesitate at giving out a one star rating because nobody takes them seriously. But this product really deserves the worst possible rating.I started off cutting vegetables. The blade was so dull I applied more pressure than I was comfortable with, and was afraid I would slip and injure myself. Paring knife could not peel fruits at all. The handles were plastic and seemed like they were glued on. No rivets.I paid $14 for this product. And my ulimate impression is that I paid way too much."
1,sabatier knife set,i was very disappointed with this item......all the knives rusted within a months time.
3,"Knives are ok, but the block is like a second.","The knives in this sets are fine for the money spent, however, if you like a good presentation, don't buy this set. The block is not well finished and the knives don't fit properly. I gave it 3 stars because the price was so low. If I had spent more, it would have been 2 stars."
2,Disappointed,I find the paring knife awkward to use. The handle is longer than the blade. I have a small hand and I don't have good control of the knife. The steak knives are not sharp and it is like using a dull saw to cut the meat. I like the large knife for chopping vegetables. The bread knife doesn't cut as well as the one I threw away when I received my new set of knives.
1,"Very dull and rusted, the absolute junk pile of steel","This knife set is very dull in cutting, and by the way...stainless steel (?)... ha...ha...ha...Simply put, do not buy this set. It's an waste of your money. My set ended up in the recycle bin."
3,What you pay is what you get!,"I was expecting a little more out off the purchase considering the original price and the brand. However, I can't complain considering I only spent $20 for a 14-Piece Block Set."
4,Worth the ($),"I think that you can't go wrong for ($) with this knife set. The steak knives alone were worth it. I found them to be sufficiently sharp. I haven't had a problem with rust like some of the reviews I have read. The larger knives I found to be not as sharp as I would have liked them to be. They are not the Sebatier Cuisine France line which are made in France. I have a couple of those and find them to be of superior quality. These are made in China. But I liked these enough that I bought a set for my son and his wife. I wouldn't give them as a wedding gift, but as a shower gift, possibly. Overall, I would say they are a good value at ($)."
1,Free is too much to pay!,I would rate this set no stars if the option was available! The retail price of this is almost $$$$? Give me a break - these knives are not of a good quality and I wouldn't recommend them at all...they are already rusting on me and the block has one slot more than the knives that came in the set. Don't waste your money!
3,(One knife is missing) Only received 13-piece knife set,"Set is missing one knife (slicer); otherwise, it's ok."
3,Not what I expected ...,"Given the extremely low price of this product, I guess I shouldn't have been suprised that it wasn't perfect. When I first opened the box, I discovered that, instead of six steak knives and a paring knife, I had seven steak knives and no paring knife. It didn't seem a big enough deal to be worth sending everything back (I already have a decent paring knife); however, a couple of weeks later, I noticed that the kitchen scissors included with the set bear the logo ""Martha Stewart Everyday,"" rather than Sabatier. Again, they're perfectly fine, but it does make me wonder whether this is the only product apparently patched together from the spare parts of others ...Having said this, the knives themselves are quite well-balanced and lightweight without being flimsy. And I like having a sharpening tool included in the set."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,I can't even tell you what the quality of the knifes is because I had to return them TWICE. Both sets I received were missing the exact same knife. I experienced the same problem with another Sabatier set I ordered at teh same time. Save yourself the frustration and pay a few extra bucks elsewhere!
1,Simply Cheap Quality,"1. The handles are atrocious-- slippery, awkward, uncomfortable, at a bad angle.2. The blades easily rust and arrive very dull. They require constant re-sharpening. Furthermore, they are at a horrible angle with the handle, making it awkward and uncomfortable to chop easily or fast.3. High maintainence. The only way to preserve the blades is to hand-wash them, dry them, and immediately oil them.4. These knives are too light and flimsy. The chef-knife is not full-tang and does not have a bolster. Therefore, it is difficult to mince and dice.These are not a decent set of knives. If you spend twice as much or more, you'll get far better quality. Definitely DO NOT buy these knives if you are looking for just one good decent set of knives for your kitchen."
3,Decent set with so so quality,"I got this set few months ago. The knives are decent but the handles do not have a good feel to them. Quality of the knives are so so. Some of the handles are no very well put together. However for the price, I am not complaining."
1,TO ADD TO MY PREVIOUS REVIEW,"Which I still don't see listed at Amazon, I returned this knife set because the wood block was very poorly made and there was a knife missing. The box was torn as if someone else had bought and returned it already. Well, today I got an e-mail saying the return was not an error on Amazon's part and they were only returning $4.64 of the $12.99 price! So if you want really crappy knives that will cost you more to return than to keep, this is the set to buy, but before you do, try your local 99 cent store first - hey, whatever they sell there can't be any worse!"
3,It's only $19,"What can you expect for twenty bucks? You get a full set of knives, and a decent - not great, not beautiful - block. For $20, I'm quite pleased. I bought this for the block primarily. I gave the knives to my callege daughter and she was very happy (but how discriminating of tastes can a girl who has trouble boiling water have??) It's just not that important that I spend $100 on a knife block. This has lots of slots and works just fine, thank you. As for these dolts that put their knives in the dishwasher, well you deserve to have rusty knives. Hand wash them."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"You get what you paid for, this is really a piece of junk. And don't believe the list price of $240. Nobody in his right mind will sell these knives at $240, not even $24. I ordered these knives as a Christmas gift for a friend and I am too embarrassed to give them out. I think I will just throw them away."
3,Good quality considering price,I wouldn't recomment it if it wasn't for the price. The blades are pretty good and balanced but the finish is not. Anyway for 10 bucks it hard to beat.
4,Finally.. new knives,"I gave this to my dad for Christmas.. mostly because it was a great deal. We've had our knife set for 12 years but the knives finally just about had it. We haven't used them on any food yet, but they seem to be good when I examined them."
2,Lacking a piece,I purchased the 14 piece cutlery knife set. It came with 14 slots in the block but only 13 items to put in the slots. It looks like one is missing but they count the block as one item. Makes it hard to give as a gift when one slot will always be blank.
5,Great Deal,"i'm a little surprised that people have had a bad experience with this Amazon product. I had a ""Gold Box"" offer for these knives, they were exactly [$$$], and I had already bought the PerfectGrip set at the incredible bargain price of [$$$] or something. IT'S NOT TRUE - these knives are a GREAT deal, they are perfect French cutlery, and I'm buying more. You should, too. (And the blades are wonderful!)"
4,Dennis the Hackmaster.,"Are you tired of those serated knives that cut in a curve and cannot be forced to cut a straight line and leave a sawed or chewed up appearance meat that you have slaved to make right and look good for your family?Me too! The knives in this set have a straight ground edge that can be sharpened with a stone or have the edge re-aligned with the included knife true included with the set,( They call it by another name).Professional chef's the world over use a ""true"" to keep their knives cutting their best and only use a stone when the edge is worn down too far for the true.Most true's cost more than the original price of this knife set and that is all you get, a true.If you dine with the Rockefellers, Kennedy's or the Bushes then you can afford to pay $500.00-$1,000.00 for your knives, but if you are like me then this set is a double bargain.Your decission, Your money, Spend it wisely."
2,To clarify for those who are confused,"ALL knife manufacturers count the KNIFE BLOCK as ONE piece of a knife set. Wusthof, Henckles EVERYBODY. This is a common practice not only for knife sets, but tool sets where a case is included or any multi part item. Check it out.Thus on this set:1 chef's2 bread3 slicer4 utility5 paring6 steak knife7 steak knife8 steak knife9 steak knife10 steak knife11 steak knife12 honing steel13 shear14 14slot hardwood storage blockCheck out the other manufacturers block sets, this isn't an expensive set of knives or even a quality set. BUT THERE ARE FOURTEEN PIECES AS ADVERTISED."
1,How is it possible that the list price is $240???,"I think the list price is off by a decimal place. It would make more sense if the list price was $24. I think Amazon would be taking a huge hit if it was actually selling an item that some people value at over $200 for only $19.This isn't really a review, I just want you guys to double check this. Thanks!"
1,DON'T BUY!!! SCAM!!!,"After reading all the good reviews, i was so excited to get the knife set. when i got it, the surprise came:1. amazon deletes what i have to say about the scam bc they have poor customer service in dealing with my problem as well as making sabatier look bad.2. it's a bit on the cheap side. you can tell the quality is not very good. i haven't used it much yet, but i suppose it works ok. for the money, it's a decent buy, though I AM STILL ANGRY ABOUT THE MISSING KNIFE!"
2,Very dull and cheaply made,"$20 set for $20.Do not waist your money, if you expect German quality from this one.Made in China, nothing else to add."
1,Very bad condition and missing knife,"I was deceived by the review on this set, so I bought it without a second thought. When I received it, it a very BAAAAAD surprise. One MISSING knife, and another RUSTY one."
4,These knives work great for me,"I have to say that i bought these knives and i am very happy with them. I have not had a problem. No rust, very sharp etc. well worth the money. I have given several way as gifts and they were all pleased. In fact 2 persons asked me to come on today and get an extra set for thier inlaws. Very pleased."
1,Junk,I'm using my old knive set. I hope this provides insight into my opinion of this product.I won't buy knives on the internet again.
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these knives when they were around $25. They are sturdy, but they are not sharp at all...at least mine aren't. It comes with a sharpener, but it doesn't work like it should. I also have some rust spots on mine. You have to make sure you wipe the water off after you wash them or you will get little rust spots. I was disapointed with the sharpness. I figured they would be sharp. I guess you get what you pay for. I do really like the scissors though and the steak knives."
1,knifes rust!,I bought Sabatier Chef-Star 14 piece knife set about 3 month ago Since then a few knifes RUSTED! This is ridiculously bad quality.
3,List Price Is A Joke - Average Quality Knife Set,"I've had these knives for several months now. I've had no rust problems, but they're average knives at best. The list price must have been dreamed up in some other currency or in wishful thinking. I got $20 worth and that's it.It's a shame that a real list price isn't published; this is very deceiving and wrong."
1,"This Knife Set sucks, even for a college student","I've been using this knife set for a couple weeks now, and I am a college student at UC Berkeley. I can honestly say this was a waste of my money. There was rust on the knives after my first use and the block set is poorly made. There is dried glue all over the wooden block, as if a 5 year old put it together. DONT buy this product unless you got $20 to waste."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"This certainly looked like it would be a nice set, and considering the price, I was fine with overlooking the cheap black handles, but I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I washed some of these knives and they RUSTED! High Carbon Stainless Steel? I don't think so!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this set!!!"
1,This is immoral,"Sabaiter (and/or Amazon) repeatedly have been selling these knives at a very small fraction (7% or so) of the original list price. These knives rust unless you hand wash and the quality sucks. However, if you are here the first time, you'll think this is a great deal. Somewhere along the line, these companies need to realize that the street price is nowhere near the list. The ONLY reason for putting a very high (15 times?) list REPEATEDLY (this in not a 1-time event) is to bilk people. Should be a law against this."
1,poor quality even given the low price,"I bought these knives with modest expectations, but still, I have been disappointed. The plastic handles are cheap and do not allow the user to hold the knives at the proper angle. The blades are made of very cheap steel, and started showing signs of rust almost immediately."
1,Rusts,Rusts...not worth 40.00. The quality is not even worth the original price..no way. Washed in sink careful one time and rusted on a few knives..
1,This is the worse set of knifes I have ever bought,These rust easy and are very dull I was very disappointed in this purchase. Save your money up for a better set.
1,Cheap Cheap Knives,"This is one of the cheapest set of knives I have ever purchased. Saying that, I think the future purchaser should steer clear of this ultimately disappointing set. I opened the box, took one look, and returned the item immediately. Save your money and buy something else."
4,great product,It is great product. My wife loves it. Perfect sleek edges.Even a perfect beauty to view it standing in kitchen. A must have thing for every kitchen.
4,Knives are OK if you sharpen them,"I was skeptical to buy a $240 set of knives for $30. I gave them a try and after sharpening them several times over a period of time, they are OK"
2,got dull pretty quick,"The block is nice and the blades look nice int he beginning, but I guess you get what you pay for. These blades got dull very quick and Barely cut anymore."
1,I regret buying this.,"I do not recommend this at all. It's not sharp. Friends and family who have used it when they are at my house said the blades are very dull. I need to sharpen it after every use. There are so many other knife selections out there that are much better. Trust me, don't buy this one."
1,I'm a knife expert,"Please do not waste money on a set like this that you are going to throw away in a couple of years. It is made of shoddy materials and will not last. Get yourself a set of CUTCO knives. If you cannot find a CUTCO representative, then go ahead and pay more for henkels. Henkels in closer to quality to CUTCO which is the ideal choice when it comes to everything from guarntees to pricing. but please do yourself a favor and stay any from these inferior products."
1,Extremely disappointed!!!,"I ordered 5 sets for myself and friends. I was very disappointed, because the quality is so poor. I feel bad for ordering them for my friends. None of us is satisfied. We all want to return them. Unfortunately, the postage is too expensive.I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. DON'T LET THE PRICE FOOL YOU."
1,Raised price suddenly,"It is really, really irritating when the price of an item increases 20% overnight!"
5,Gorgeous knives!,"Faced for the first time with the prospect of putting together a kitchen from scratch, one of the first things I wanted was a good set of knives. I asked around and was told by my grandmother and two of my aunts that Sabatier makes very good knives. Having ordered, received, and used this set myself, I strongly agree with them. These knives are wonderful: beautifully made and highly functional. I imagine I will be using these for years to come. They are also a very attractive addition to my kitchen. I recommend them very highly."
3,14 piece set really has 13 pieces!,"It is misleading to advertise this as a 14 piece knife set. Even though there are 14 slots in the wooden block, the set only contains 13 utensils. After searching all over for the missing piece, I studied the box and discovered that they count the wooden block as one of the pieces! Then why the extra slot?? Also, the decorative circle on the side of the scissors fell off as I unpacked my set, which makes me wonder about the quality of these pieces. I think the... ""regular price"" is a real come-on; no way would this set sell for that much!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"They are exactly as I expected. Decent quality, stamped blades and Plastic handles. After a few trips to the dishwasher the stainless steel blades actually starting to rust."
4,A great set of knives,I was attracted to these knives by a recommendation from a co-worker. I ordered 2 sets with the intent of giving one of them as a gift and keeping the other. I've been extremely pleased with the quality and durability of these knives. They are a great bargain.
3,Price vs Quality,"This is a good set of knives for the reduced price Amazon hason them, but don't put any consideration of list price as theycould never be worth that unless we went through one hell of ainflationary period such as back in early nineties.I would buy this set for my daughter for wedding present if I was in doubt of her marriage not making it and her husband getting them;I would then buy her a better set for her tenthanniversary."
2,"Absolute junk, missing knife and blades couldn't cut tape.","This item was promptly shipped, however it was missing the utility knife and when I went to use the chef's knife to cut open the tape on a box I had to saw back and forth to break through the postal priority tape. Waiting for a refund. I would only recommend this set of knives to someone who is looking for a workout from their set of kitchen knives because that is what they will get when trying to cut with these, if they get the whole set. Stick with Wuhstoff-Trident and you will NEVER be disappointed."
1,"Amazon, thanks for ripping me off",These knives start rusting just a few days after the window closes to return them. You are better off going [elsewhere;] my knives from there are 3 years old and have never rusted.
1,expectations have been disappointing,The price was great but the started to rust within a week of normal use. We did not put them in the dishwasher and only hand washed them. Within a week's time rust stains started showing up and would not use them any more...To have to oil and pamper a set of knives would not be practical in our busy family...Stay away from these knives!!!
1,Good value....If you like RUST.,"While the inexpensive price is appealing, I washed the set once, and I think all but one of the knives showed spots of rust. Initially I thought the set looked great, but after I washed them, I'm afraid of using them for fear of tetanus from all the rust that has since appeared all over the blades. They say it is made from stainless steel, but obviously not rustless steel. I would recommend spending a little more for a set that has proven to not rust after the first wash."
1,Yikes!,"What a cheap set of knives. After only a few weeks, most have dulled and a few have even presented rust spots. Perhaps Amazon should stick to books and CD's untill they can quality test the products they are peddling. Shame on me for not knowing that it was too good of a price to be true."
3,NOT THE BEST _ BUT IT CUTS,"Well if your just the average person who,expects a knife to cut, you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a more upscale product or like in my case I get tired of things right away and don't want it forever, then yes it's an okay set. They are very light in weight. They feel very Cheap. Sometimes you get what you pay for. I would not give this as a gift."
4,Great buy!,"I got this at a great price from my Goldbox. For the money you can't go wrong! The knives are sharp, attractive, and work as advertised. No worries here!"
1,Dull - very dull.,"This was purchased as a gift for a mother-in-law, and we just got back from her house and personally saw, and used, this knife set. Luckily she is not a chef or that interested in cooking because if she were I would be embarrassed about this gift. I tried each of the knives and they were so dull that I could do better with the everyday stainless steel stuff. A big, big disappointment - yes, it was cheap but pago up some more money and get something better. I definitely will next go-around!"
2,NOT a cut above the rest!,"I was excited about receiving these knives thinking I would be able to cut through tin cans and then slice easily through tomatoes...I should have opted for the Ginsu set. These are not great, not as sharp as I thought they would be either. I also got a mediocre product for a decent price, but does that actually qualify as a good thing?! I'm not sure"
2,Missing a knife....,"While I was pleased w/ the knifes themselves, I was EXTREMELY disappointed that a NEW, UNWRAPPED set of knives was missing one piece."
4,Very sharp and attractive,"I love this set. The knives are very sharp and the scissors work for cutting Chicken very well. My only dislike is that 2 of the knives have a couple of rust spots. These were easily removed, but I have had them only a couple of months."
3,good value for price,"It is really difficult to judge the quality of product when you dont physically see them in your hand. This set of knives are okay in quality and good value for money. Infact I saw similar knife sets in Target and Kohls of really good quality, where I could have bought better sets with little more money. I got driven by money and bought these.Also, I ordered black block case but I got wooden case and on that one knife is missing. Can't help it, and on that I don't have energy and time to send them back for replacement."
1,Dull edges,"Imagine the disappointment. You anxiously await the arrival of your Sabatier knives, which you ordered for cooking school. Their arrival coincides with a dinner party you are throwing at your house. You want to break them in immediately, but you discover that every single knife is DULL.The day after my dinner party, I spent a grand total of 6 hours sharpening these knives on a wet stone. Unfortunately, there would not be enough time for me to exchange the knives before my classes. Major, major disappointment. Caveat emptor. You get what you pay for, but it shouldn't be that way."
1,Rusted in a month,Cheap as can be and not worth a dime. Most of them rusted on first wash. Not stainless steel nor made of any good quality.
1,"look nice, do not last","Sure the price is great, but whats the point if they melt in front of your eyes? these knives rust and stain very easily - please pass up! invest in a nice set that will last!amazon, of course, had fast shipping - so they get a star for that"
4,Great content - why no supply ???,"This is a DVD with a number of videos and a live section, including some backstage clips. I can see why it would sell well, but not why it would not be resupplied - it's a must-have for Niagara fans and a very reasonable, low-risk buy for those who don't know the group but who like French music and like Rolling Stones-type rock."
4,cute cute cute,This video is wonderful for an intro to cane dancing. I loved it. My favorite part is the folkloric steps. The choreography is great for beggining belly dancers too. I really enjoyed that she gives you the elements of twirling and techniques as well as a seperate section for the folkloric foot patterns. This enables a dancer to drill these movements and take it to the floor for improv if so desired. Lovely :)
5,Good Video,"Being a Middle Eastern dance specialist, it is great to get other people's perspectives on the art. I am quite happy to have it in my collection."
1,Use more ink cleaning than printing,"I bought some black and color cartridges by Amazon Imaging. What a waste of money. When I first installed them, it took about six cleaning cycles before they were ready to print. Then after every ten or so copies one of the colors would clog. Yesterday red got clogged so I ran eight cleaning cycles. Once red started working, blue got clogged and that took another six cleaning cycles. After all those cleaning cycles my black cartridge was empty and I had to replace it.I purchased these inks thinking that maybe Amazon.com had started a house brand, but from what I can tell Amazon Imaging has no connection to Amazon.com.Avoid these cartridges. The couple dollars you might save up front will be lost to cleaning cycles and wasted paper."
4,Great book for Kindergarten,"I am so excited about using this book to reinforce work families for my kindergarten students. I like the word cards that are in the book. Very age appropriate for Kindergarten and up, but I don't believe any of my preschool students could use this book at this time although it could be used to reinforce rhyming concepts."
5,Phonics books - mini printable,These are great. Helps with independent learning or learning in groups in the classroom.
5,Fun Little Books to reinforce Rhyming,"My daughter loves these. My daughter especially loves writing in the letters to complete the words. I suppose I'm a funny mom, but I always give books as birthday gifts, because I figure that every child gets toys for their birthday. I made some for a friend's son who is in kindergarten for his birthday and he loved them too. It was a gift for him and his parents. It made him feel so good to tell his mom he read a book on his own!One mom commented on the need to assemble the books and that she hadn't realized that before she bought the book. Most Scholastic teaching books are that way--but I love that, because you can copy them over and over again. You have the right to reproduce the sheets for personal use."
2,NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING,"Maybe I didn't read the description closely enough, but I didn't realize that the books needed to be cut out and assembled. The book is still sitting on a shelf waiting for me to find enough time to figure out how to assemble them. Not a good product for a busy mom with a lot going on."
2,"If you have the other version, skip this.","This sounds like it was made in about a week on a shoestring budget. What is it? Well, it's a slaughtered version of the *real* Akira soundtrack with dialogue and sound effects from the movie woven in. A hardcore fan of the movie might like this, but I certainly didn't. True, there are some goodparts, but not many... Tetsuo's laugh, for instance, has to be one of the most chilling sounds on record, and there's some odd interweaving of different tracks from the *real* soundtrack that might've been promising given a little more time. This one was a real disappointment to me, considering how great the *real* soundtrack was. Save your money and instead try to find some Geinoh Yamashirogumi CDs that you can get imported from Japan. I'd reccommend Ecophony Rinne and Ecophony Gaia in a heartbeat; good luck finding them, though."
1,THIS SUCKS!!!,"I am so dissapointed in this sound track. Akira is my favoret anime, and I've always loved the music from it, but this item was a complete waste of time and money. This version of the akira sound track is simply a digital recording of the origional movie's audio, complete with Japanies dialog, and sound effects. If you want the sound track to this movie, look around, and find the one that actually has more than 4 tracks on it. I think that one may be just the music, but I don't know for sure."
1,Not worth the purchase,"This is a HUGE reap-off!I wish I would had NEVER purchased this!I had the original soundtrack on disk prior and because someone stole it, I wanted to purchase a new one. Well THIS is NOT like an actual Akira soundtrack per say. This is ripped off directly from the movie with the characters talking in the background. In other words, he just clipped the sound file from the movie and is ripping them to disks to sell.Fooled me once and never more!"
4,Tex-Mex Cookbook,"Different than the ordinary cookbook....gives you a lot of background on how Mexican cooking was introduced to Texas and how it emerged into Tex-Mex. If you are looking for a book filled only with recipes, this isn't it. However, it is an interesting read and there are some good items within. For the price, its worth the purchase."
4,Tentatively smitten,"I LOVE the photos and concept, but found some copy errors as well as other references that reduced the author's Tex-Mex cred, in my eyes. A Mexican martini is dubbed a ""Mexican margarita**,"" a michelada recipe doesn't mention clam juice, and there's mucho variation between terms like ""chili queen"" and ""chile queen."" I may be one neurotic Texan, but I want dead accuracy if we're describing A. History and B. Recipes.All that said, I've actually really enjoyed this purchase and can't wait to experiment with it more.** This is credited to a particular restaurant, but it still seems off - or at least warranting of an explanation. Aren't all/most margaritas Mexican?"
3,Good history... not creative,I have several books by Rob Walsh and most are much more creative. This book gives a nice historical account of the development of Tex-Mex cusine. Unfortunately it stops short of exploring the onward growth of the cusine. I find it an interesting read but not too useful as a cookbook.
1,Tex Mex Cookbook by Robb Walsh,Robb Walsh's Tex-Mex Cookbook is a big disappointment and a waste of my money. The photos were of such poor quality (albeit historic) that it would have been better not to show any photos at all.
5,"A ""must have"" if you are a Texan living abroad","As a native of central Texas, I know my Tex-Mex. I was really suffering when I moved to Switzerland and was living outside of Texas for the first time ever. After several disappointing visits to Swiss ""Tex-Mex"" restaurants, I realized the only way I'd get a taste of home would be if I made it myself. Unlike the other Tex-Mex cookbooks I've tried, these recipes are easy and don't require a huge list of ingredients. I can buy a few key spices when I visit Texas and then the rest of the ingredients are universal enough that I can get here. In particular, the cheese enchiladas have been a life saver for me--so easy to make, and so authentic tasting! The history is interesting to read about, too!"
4,Tex-Mex is big in Louisiana,"Robb Walsh is a terrific Texas food writer. This little volume is as much history as it is cookbook; it is witty, entertaining, and thoroughly enjoyable. Walsh doesn't dance around the fact that Tex-Mex bears little resemblance to authentic Mexican cuisine; he points out that most Tex-Mex dishes were developed in restaurants owned by Anglos. If you like Americanized Mexican food, you need to own this book."
2,NO CODE--disappointed!,"This item was advertised as including a code to take you pet online. When the item arrived, the tag with code was not attached. Kids seriously bummed."
3,Boring to Mom-Fun to Son,"Overall this is just a ordinary stuffed creature (not a real animal). If you go on to the Neopets website www.neopets.com you can set up a pet to match your stuffed pet and give it a name, etc. The website is cool with lots of very fun games, however there is minimal interaction with the actual ""pet"", other that you need to accrue neopoints to buy food to feed the ""pet"" and buy toys for the pet etc. For true interaction Toon Town is a BLAST and much more fun."
5,"TWENTY stars, at least!","In a word -- WOW. Probably the best funk album ever recorded in Brazil, and certainly one of the best Brazilian pop albums as well. Features the often-anthologized ""Umbabarauma"" and the super-funky ""Xica da Silva,"" along with a whole slew of other great tracks, such as the James Brown/Sly Stone inspired ""Hermes Trismegisto Escriveu"" and other groove-heavy wonders. A couple of songs are too shrill -- less disco flirtations than just plain old pop-funk gone jittery. One such track is an unfortunate remake of ""Taj Mahal,"" the song from which Rod Stewart swiped the melody to ""If You Think I'm Sexy""... Nevertheless, this is a masterpiece, one of the best Brazilian albums of the '70s. Absolutely essential, required listening."
5,KA-BOOM,"This deserves a spot on any soul/funk fan's shelf. I had Umbagarrauma on a complilation CD and wanted to hear more. I am familiar with other Brazilian styles and the unrelated Rock en Espanol styles but this one is the king. You can party to it, work out, or just groove to this man's genius in your car. I went through the Starbuck's drive through and the kid said,""who is that."" Who says the best funk n soul comes out of America? Buy it you won't regret it."
5,ILoveJorge,"Musically gorgeous and unique, great rhythm, Jorge's voice is amazing, the album has a lot of musical depth, is uplifting, tropical. It's an amazing work of his!"
4,Salve Jorge!,"Samba, funk and soul together with spiritual side of Jorge... This is another powerfull example of how great Ben Jor is."
