1,Not worth the money,"Extremely short and weird benji movie. Not really about the dog, and not at all inspiring as some of the others were."
1,How Can I Describe How Lame This Video Is?,"OK--I buy these videos for my pug, Foo Dog. He WORSHIPS Benji. Both of us were sorely disappointed with 'Benji's Very Lame Christmas,' altho Foo was too polite to complain. Benji does nothing but be carried around for 30 minutes, while some poor 'thin Santa' actor mouths pathetic dialogue, culminating in a REALLY awful song & dance number with lots of very poorly made-up elves. If I'd paid more than $4.99, I'd be really mad."
4,"Not what I expected, but still classic Bones","Frankie Bones can always be depended on to take tech-house back to its bedroom-production roots, yet slip in a surprise or two as well. This time the surprises are more jarring than usual. As other reviewes have mentioned, this is not a DJ mix but a compilation of original material. If this had been marketed as a straight-out artist album it would be a five-star effort, but anything bearing the Computer Controlled title will, for me at least, be measured against volume 1 of the series, which is one of the greatest house music CD's of all time. Missing also is the dub-plate gronk of that CD, which is part of its raw appeal. This CD sounds almost too clean. But this is still Frankie Bones, and anything he makes deserves a top-ten albums-of-the-year berth. Just be warned, and stick with Army Of One if you want a DJ mix of Bones' recent originals."
3,It's good,I'm just going to correct the other review first by saying that this is not jungle/drum and bass but techno. This album is a three star's is because it is not mixed. I own every Frankie Bones album that were released in the US since 1995 and this is the 2nd of them that were not mixed. Great music on the album....but when I listen to electronica I want it to be a 74 minute journey not a four minute journey with a two second break before starting again. Enough said on this album. Just be aware that it is not mixed.
5,Great first time book for the budding cartoonist.,"Of all the cartooning books, I have thus far, Mark Heaths book is the first to talk about making mistakes and then pointing out his own. That gives you hope for your own work. Plus he draws funny."
1,Nothing to Learn Here,"As a beginning-intermediate cartoonist, there is absolutely nothing to learn in this book that hasn't been done 100 times better somewhere else. Half the time, the writer seemed more interested in cartooning himself in joke (?) situations. Crude drawings compared to others. Don't waste your money, stick with C. Hart books instead. I so disappointed with this book, I am returning it."
2,Not a great book for the money,"The book is only worth about $5. It has only a hundred or so pages that are more of the author's cartoons than any practical advice. On the last page of the book, the author points out all the mistakes he made in the book but decided to leave in so that he could point them out to us. I'm interested in cartooning/comic strips and I feel that I am no closer to being able to do that than I was before I read the book. I don't understand how this book got all great reviews. Don't be fooled like I was!"
4,For prototype controller,I used these with a breadboard to build a controller and the controller is now in production. The service was excellent.
3,Ultra ULT31310 HDD enclosure - fan replacement,"I've owned an Ultra ULT31310 with a WD 320GB drive for about 1 year without problems - except for the noisy fan other reviewers complain about. I tried the WD40 trick on the fan bearing, which helped a little but it was still noisy. I think this fan is rated at 25dBa.I could no longer take the noise so decided to swap the fan out for a Scythe Mini-Kaze SY124010L rated at 14dBa. What a difference ! Peace at last ! This fan is very quiet and inexpensive. You will need to change the red and black lead positions on the connector to match the original position (push down on the metal showing thru the side of the connector to release the catch and pull out). I used a little glue from a hot glue gun to fix the fan in place.If you're suffering from the noisy fan, try this inexpensive fix. Your ears will love you."
3,Easy to use but too loud,"I have been using this enclosure for a year, and it has held up a lot better than I thought it would. I've opened it up and swapped drives a few times consolidating data among several computers. It's great that it has a cooling fan - keeps the drive nice and cool, which makes it a good enclosure for a backup drive. However, I originally bought it for my husband to use with his pro tools rig for recording audio, and this drive enclosure is way WAY TOO LOUD for that."
5,Great product,I am working in Iraq and have seen every type of external hard drive and enclosure on the market put to the extreme tests. In my office alone there is more than 3 terabytes in external enclosures and for the size and cooling ability the Ultra is the best. It is made of plastic but the plastic is very durable and it is a breeze to open the case unless you are a complete moron. The drives can be daisy chained up to three using the firewire cables and it doesn't matter weither the jumper is set to cable select or master. Tight fit but it's very much worth the effort. We now order only Ultra external cases due to size and durability.
2,Keep Shopping,Very cheap materials and construction. The fan in mine makes so much noise I have to keep it closed up in a cabinet. I'm currently looking for a replacement. I would not recommend this product.
2,Cheap and noisy,"Obviously, it's cheap. But I've had mine over a year now.... no it hasn't failed, but it does scare me. besides the plastic cracking, the fan is making me nervous. About half the time now when I turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise, which changes frequency over time, slowing down. I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit). This vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside, and I'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my HD to crash and lose all my photos, music, backups, etc.Currently shopping for a replacement, and I would not recommend this."
2,Didn't work at all,"Unrecognized USB device on one PC running Windows 2000, but in the other Windows 2000 PC, it worked fine. These are both older machines, but still I would think it should work without any problems. Tech support didn't put me on hold for ever, but they also didn't offer any help to get this thing to work. They said send it back."
1,horrible construction,"expensive piece of junk. the power cable broke off when i was trying to get it to restart (stopped working for no apparent reason). top it off, very low powered cheap fan, so i'm sure that if i had carried on using it, the hard drive would have eventually died in that plastic coffin, due to lack of heat dissipation."
2,"Works, but super ghetto construction","Don't get me wrong, this thing works, but it's the cheapest construction item I have seen in a long time!The plastic is very thin and feels very flimsy, and it is a huge pain to fit a 3.5"" harddrive into this thing. It barely fits, and I had a heck of a time trying to arrange the cables to push it far enough to get all the screwes in place. And I would have really prefered if I could open it without a screw driver...On the bright side, it is indeed very compact, and comes with all the accessories you need - usb cable, firewire cable, and even some screwes - but if a had a chance to handle this thing before I bought it I would have went for something a little more solid."
1,Good idea. but they cheaped out on the fan,"I bought this to store my music collection, which was getting quite large. I put a 300GB HD in it. I really liked the idea of a fan enclosure, because I keep this HD on a lot. It was fine for a few months, then the fan kept getting louder and louder. I opened it up, tried everyting to quiet the fan, but no good. I removed the fan, and now it's very quiet. So I payed $50 for a plastic box. Better than the racket. The noise was getting unbearable. Look elsewhere, you will not be able to stand it."
2,Super Loud,"Previous customers are right about getting the drive to fit in, it can be quite the task. At the beginning its not too bad, the fan level noise is not loud. After some time or just moving the drive a little to the side, everything is so damn squeezed in that it starts to create these unbelievably loud sounds. You have to remove all drives, turn off the hard drive and play with it maybe hitting it softly so that things move back into place and the awful sound goes away. Terrible drive, I'll see if I can get a refund on it."
4,A great way to reuse old fashioned IDE DISKs,"I renew my old IDE disk on my computer, so install a new SATA disks, due to this i have my older IDE disks going to be dispossed, with this i install one of mi disks on it, and now i have and external disk that i can use to backup my data, or move large files that will not fit on a flash memory."
3,OPPPS,"I just readed the reviews on the music and I think it pretty good,some still wish the kid never grew up at least now they have learned that he grew up and he told in this story what really happened to him from stage one to stage adult hood."
5,Looking for a hard to find item?,"I needed the workbooks for the Beth Moore course,""Jesus, The One and Only.""This particular book was nowhere to be found, becausea new course of these lessons had replaced the old material.At last, I found the old book on Amazon. I was so thrilled.It was such a relief to be able to get the books and have themdelivered to my home.Amazon has never failed to come through for me.I should have looked on Amazon first and I would havesaved myself a lot of time and frustration.Yeah, for Amazon.com.!"
3,Glad I Bought It,"The women at my Church decided to start a Bible study, they wanted to use a Beth Moore and this one was recommended to me. We are a very small country Church on a very limited budget and I found the hardbacks much cheaper than the paperback and from what research turned up, they were the same, or so I thought. I also found this leader's guide at a very reasonable price and purchased it as well. I am so glad that I did. The very first thing I saw when I started looking at it was ""make sure everyone has a workbook""...huh? After spending over $400 for what I thought was going to be our workbook, there was no way I was going back to the group and say ""oh by the way I need $600 more for workbooks""; after all this is not something we want to be a one time thing and will hopefully be ordering more books for future studies. Fortunately for our group the leader's guide had questions laid out for each chapter which we will be using as a study guide as well."
3,Not that helpful,"I was hoping this guide would help me choose the best questions to discuss with the group as each weeks collection of studies is too much for a 30 minute discussion. However, there really isn't any help in that regard. The book doesn't add much. Each week has the principal questions listed and room for my own notes, but those are found in the study guide making this redundant. This review is not reflective of the study itself. Jesus the One & Only is an amazing study into the whole life of Christ - I'm so thankful that I took on the challenge to complete this."
3,Nice book on functional programming,This is a good introduction to functional programming.It is less language specific than some of the other books.
5,I am very pleased with this as it is the best massager unit I have ever!,Delivers exactly what it promises - is easy to use and very well built. Make sure you also buy the Sheepskin pad as it is a must
4,Your wife loves how I use this product on her,"This is a fantastic product and is well worth adding to your Jenie Rub. I can tell you that my clientele is very happy with the results, as I have tripled my tips from the married women that I service. They tell me that the sheepskin is very soft to the touch, and when combined with my magic fingers, makes them tingle and feel soothed all over. And I mean all over. Yep, those married milfs seem to go crazy over this. When word spread around my neighborhood that I was using this sheepskin cover, I almost couldn't keep up with the bookings. My clients report many more ""happy endings"" and I have to especially thank M Latham's wife, who has been a client of mine for years (due to unsatisfying experiences in her bedroom she tells me) and who became an avid referral source for me after I added this product to my line of assorted body stimulants and relaxers. Without her, I wouldn't be known as the Midnight Cowboy of the Bridge Club."
1,Might be usable if you only want a tiny bit of a massage,"We tried this pad cover and found that it cushioned the vibrations so much that I could not feel it. I need a lot of vibration from a massager in order to unlock my leg muscles. If you are a delicate person, and can only tolerate a little vibration, then this pad may be of use, otherwise I expect that I may never see this pad out of the box again."
2,Kind of rough on bare skin,"I am surprised that sheepskin can be rough - but this is too rough on my bare skin. And that was the reason I purchased it - because I thought it would make the Jeanie Rub nicer on bare skin. It does not do that for me. I am not sure if it is washable. If it is - perhaps that would soften it up. It does fit the Jeanie Rub nicely, but as delivered, it is getting no use in our home. Disappointing."
5,Awesome sheepskin cover!,I was in such a hurry that I didn't notice I was purchasing the cover and not the massager. DOH!!
1,Totally disappointed!!!!,I thought was a CD by the REAL Pivot from the US. Instead it is an overpriced piece of hippie crap! I wish Amazon could be more clear when there are multiple bands with the same name!!!!
3,prefer body wash,Tried it once and won't buy it anymore. It doesn't wash as a regular body wash. There is no foam at all and almost impossible to take a bath with but sure does give u a moisture. Prefer same brand but regular body wash.
4,good but there are altnatives,good product and it has a nice scent but costly to reorder. I would recommend Aveeno Moisturizing Shower & Bath oil- a good alternative.
1,Color me annoyed,"I printed a return label for this course within one hour of receiving it. The entire 2 CD set is basically one short stlye demonstration after another. Very boring and hard to listen to. Scales, pitch, intervals, and so on are not part of this course. The ""book"" is basically a 5X7 twenty page pamphlet that was stuck inside the CD case and of little value. Not what I was expecting and not what I'd call ""Singing Lessons."""
5,I did too!!,"Before reading this book, I had already discovered low-carb, lost 35 pounds, and kept it off for 2 1/2 years. But I figured there's always something new to learn, and I learned a lot from Dana Carpender!This is a very well researched, intelligently written book, put in interesting, fun text that we can all understand. Dana has put in the time to thoroughly research all of the current low carb plans and explains the basics of each one. I defy anyone (who's on a low fat diet that's not working) to read the FIRST CHAPTER of this book and not seriously rethink their weightloss plan!I'll be honest, I actually got this book from my library, but I have just ordered it AND her '500 Low Carb Recipes'! I'm buying the recipe book sight unseen-I have no doubt it will be good! These are keepers! I hope to see more from Dana Carpender!"
4,Well Worth the Read,"I had read many of the books she talks about here, but this helped a great deal by comparing the low carb plans that are in vogue now. If you know you have the carb intolerance problem, I think this book will give you a good feel for the different programs. She has a lot of medical information which is not well doucumented although there is a bibliography in the back. I felt there was a severe lack of footnotes. I will recommend this book to my low carb friends."
5,Great book to share with others!,"This book has a very good explanation of low-carb diets, how they work, and the different types available, with pros and cons of each. I have lost 25 lbs. on my diet and I still have trouble explaining how it works to people. So I have bought two new copies to give to friends who are wondering ""what's it all about""? This book does not get TOO technical, it's just the right amount for someone who is thinking about going lo-carb. I recommend it highly!"
5,This Really Works!!!,"Our daughter loves this diet and encouraged my husband and I to try it. We started on June 1, 2001, and by the middle of September we had lost a combined total of 100 pounds. Since then, we have shared this book and diet with many friends and all have had success. With the maintenance plan, we have kept the weight off and plan to stay on this eating plan forever. I also have to share this; before the diet, I was on Lipitor and blood pressure medication. Since being on this plan, my cholesterol and blood pressure have dropped so I no longer need any medication. WOW!!"
2,Its OK,"Its not that the book isnt well written. It is. Its just that as a vegan I'm not sure that I should go back to eating animal flesh.I did go back to eating eggs for a while, bit I couldnt notice any difference."
3,Unsophiticated,"After reading most of the science based Paleo/Primal books out there, this paled in comparison. I would recommend reading Taubes, Wolf, Sisson, Cordain, DeVany and Gedgaudas instead."
1,It can be dangerous,"I've tried it in the past and low or no carb diets are dangerous, the ketonic state is dangerous to your body and you'll lose mostly water and overstress your colon, your stomach, etc. The most fit countries in the world are the Mediterranean ones and they eat carbs and proteins and fats every single day with every single meal."
2,Not the healthiest,"I bought this book along with 2 others by Dana Carpenter as an aid in helping me lose weight thinking that these would be healthy recipes, i.e no processed foods included in the recipes. I was disappointed in this - she includes canned products as well as splenda."
4,"Good, but ESB was better.","Well...it did have some good memorable music--I really like the ROTJ theme, but ESB was better. The Emperor's Theme is very good though. I'm listening to the Phantom Mence soundtrack right now and I just noticed that track 14 (Droid Invasion and Appearance of Darth Maul) has part the Emperor's Theme woven in at the end, chorus and all (I love wordless vocals!). Listen very carefully. Hmm...omen of things to come?"
3,chicken fun pollo,"este pollo es muy divertido , los compre 4 para regalar en mi visita a mi pais y verdaderamente son muy divertidos sobre todo las patas lucen muy reales . a bougth 4 to give a friend in my country, they like a lot they are very funy gift. the only I dislike is the wings are attached to the body so is the only bad thing about it"
3,"Parthenon fans, be aware....","This is not a new Parthenon Huxley CD, but older music, 1988 - 1993 recordings. There are a few stripped down gems, but like much of his first album it's way over-produced. Big drums, synths, fake horns and Rusty Anderson's Van Halen showboating do not enhance a songwriter in the Lennon, Harrison, Petty, Bowie tradition. It just distracts from his phenomenal voice and strong lyrics.Seek out his no-budget albums like ""Deluxe"" and ""Purgatory Falls"". His trio, P. Hux, in the mid-90's was phenomenal live. I wished they'd taped those shows and released them instead. His own excellent guitar playing is more suitable to his songwriter style than Rusty (who has toned down the flashy playing with McCartney to great effect). Parthenon is one of the great unknown songwriters of the last 20 years and he deserves support and respect, but 80's production has aged worse than any other decade of rock music production."
5,Great start for the current legend,"Booker T is one of the greatest wrestlers alive today and this DVD explains how he got from zero to hero, his rise and fall and the title wins of the 5 time heavyweight champion and tag team legend. Booker has left from WCW and still is a big name in the WWE Today and will one day again retain the Heavyweight title for the sixth time in his 14 year career. If you are a Booker fan , this DVD is great and the transformation of Booker's wrestling role is also included plus all major title wins, Highlighted main events, hiatus and his feuds. This is a great documentary on legendary wrestler Booker T and will do just fine for the fans. 8.5/10."
2,"Not a good dispenser, Very Messy.",This product makes a huge mess on your counter. Also the space between the dispenser mouth and the counter is too small for some size bowls forcing you to either pour half a bowl of cereal or make a huge mess on the counter. Also removing the cap on the bottom of the dispenser between uses also ends up in cereal spilling onto the counter.
1,The Man Who Used the Universe,"[...] In a word, this book is utter tripe. The plot is trivialand has large gaping holes in it. I've read many of his other booksand loved them, but this reads more like a first draft than a finalproduct. It's hard to believe that Alan Dean Foster would put his nameto this work. [...]With all due respect to Mr. Foster, don't buythis book. [...]"
2,I really liked this book 20 years ago,"I picked up a used copy recently and was looking forward to the excellent book I read in jr high. Unfortunately it has not aged well and most of the other reviews cover this. Kees isn't that interesting, things work a bit too perfectly, characters are a bit flat, the slang is fairly lame, and it's hard to buy Kees motivations a fair amount of the time. However if you're looking for some brain candy to read on the train you can do a lot worse."
1,Highly inadequate,"Well over half of the book is spent on introductory concepts and ""background"" material, such as data structures for raytracing, implementation of reflection models, and a section on writing PPM-format graphics. The first 200 pages could easily be replaced with the words ""This book assumes a reasonable level of familiarity with the raytracing algorithm.""The example code is somewhat useless as it deals only with very basic photon mapping. None of the useful techniques are even mentioned, such as using shadow photons, building caustic maps, final gathering, or irradiance caching.Readers will probably learn just as much from any one of the dozens of free web pages that can be found by searching the Internet for ""photon mapping."" I wish I could have my money back."
2,very very disappointing,"Photon mapping is very powerful technique for rendering coustics and global illumination, but this book is not about that.It is about how to write a basic Raytracer, and most (if not all) of the info. is available for free on the web (www.flipcode.com)This is just another Andre' LaMothe(Series Editor of Premier Press's Game Development Series and old-scool 3d guru)-highschool-genius, who has red some (online) tutorial(s) and is ready to write a book.---------sorry for ma Eng."
1,Bummed,"YOU should have Minus Stars in your ratings,This thing is totally useless, Makes absolutly no difference in the signal strength with either Verizon or Altel in my car using a wilson mag mount antenna.On th other hand my Smooth Talker amp gives me a full four bars on eithe phone in the same location. Worst 300.00 I've ever spent for a paperweight. I want a refund!!, but since I've opened,the box and tryed to use it,no such luck,according to the sellers return policy.For sale Cheap!!!"
3,"They are retractable, but.....",These ear buds retract to a smaller size but is hard to do with out making a tangle of cords. The psp ear buds with the value pack are just as good if you fold them up. Also it doesn't improve the sound quality like it says on the box.
2,not too impressed,"These game buds broke just coming out of the package. One earbud completely came apart as I was getting them out of the package. I wouldn't have believed my son, had he done it...but I took them out of the package! I tried to piece it back together but I guess the wires came out, they weren't put together very well and I wouldn't recommend them."
1,What a rip off!!,"$.01 each??? Sure, but you have to pay $7.99 shipping - EACH. Order 10, and the shipping is $79.90!!!"
5,Still a favorite after all these years,"Since I first heard this album nearly 30 years ago, it has remained in my list of top albums. The ""Paint a Picture"" track still brings thankful tears to my eyes. ""Concert for a Queen"" still moves passion for my wife. ""Everytime it Rains"" still inspires me like few other songs have. The depth of lyrics and quality of music are unmatched in any genre as far as I'm concerned. The blues-feel comes through strong foreshadowing Glenn Kaiser's later work - also quite good. If I had to be limited to one Rez Band album, this would be it."
5,Art Candy for the Eye,"The new Collecting Art Plastic book from Leigh Leshner is full of wonderful photographs of plastic jewelry that a beginning to seasoned collector might reasonably expect to find on a jewelry treasure hunt. The photographs are larger than life to show the detail and the beauty in everything from nylon, bakelite, celluloid, lucite, and the newer resins. There is enough information of the new artists to peek your interest in searching them out. As a long time collector dealer myself, I consider it worthwhile to keep on hand as a resource in my jewelry library.I like the mixture of the old and new plastics which give well rounded examples of various plastic jewelry available on the market today."
2,It Was'nt That Good,"All the tracks on this album are Wisin & Yandel's old school tracks, which are like one of the first ones to come out. They almost don't sound the same, like they sound now. If your looking for good Wisin & Yandel music, look for their more recent stuff they have now."
3,It's good.,The jacket of CD was damaged. But I can listen it normally. Then it's no problem to use. And I could get my purchase 2or3days after the order.
3,Need Info no list of songs given,there is no list of songs so you know if you want to buy it. I have looked at the cover and the back cover is not shown.
2,"Well, the price is right!","This inexpensive issue has a mixture of early and later Betty Boop cartoons, some with the TV releasing logos.I searched in vain for some of my favorites, these really are some of the lesser Boops. A couple of the cartoons exhibit just the slightest blurring in the transfer to digital but generally they're just fine. The music (which was always outstanding) comes through very well.For the price this collection would be serviceable to give today's children an idea of the inventiveness of past animation."
1,A better name for this book is: Everything about bCentral,"DO NOT purchase this book if you are like me and looking for a honest and open step-by-step books to create or better understand components of an e-commerce site built using FP2002. As I look around my room I can see dozens (well over 100) computer books, many of which I received from Amazon because they are the best. Not one of them is anywhere as close to bad as this one is! It is COMPLETELY written for someone setting up a bCentral site (which is not for free and is EXTREMELY limited to say the least). I have other books from Microsoft Press but this one should of been for free because it is a sales promotion device, NOT a ecommerce instruction books as they suggest with their hype. For situations like this it would be nice if Amazon would look into outright con's such as this and stop it."
2,Self promotion for Microsoft's bCentral,This book mostly deals with the different services offered through Microsoft's very own bCentral e-commerce solution web site. It is best used by die-hard Microsoft fans who intend on utilizing the bCentral system.
3,Used for a Sociology 101 class,"It was ok, served it's purpose. as a textbook it was good, as a regular book I think it would be considered rather bland."
5,How could anyone NOT Love Ray??,"Just like my title saies, How could anyone NOT love ray?? This has to be one of the BEST shows written. It's so real to life. As a matter of fact my husband and I just can't believe how factual the show and the situations are. We have had many similar situations in our house-hold. We really enjoy watching the show as we do every night. When it's not on, all we do is pop a dvd in and enjoy!!"
5,The Best DVD Ever,"When They Started airing this show on tv here,i thought it was lame.then, after a while, they air season one, from the start,then the whole series. i started watching it every day,and i like it. now, i am a fan of Ray Romano.thoe ""Welcome to Mossport"" Sucked, He's A Good actor.this season rocks,thank god they are lettin ppl watch it all the time.I Think i'm goin' to buy it, asap. :)PPL All Around, Buy it! Hours of Fun and Entertaining Episodes!"
2,"Slow Start, 2-3 Stars.","Outside of episodes 4-Standard Deviation, 5-Look, Don't Touch, 10-Turkey Or Fish, 20-Neighbors, 21-Fascinatin Debra, & 22-Why Are We Here?. The first season was not stellar by any means. The first episode and the Eulogy were lame. Thankfully, this series was not cancelled. It would turn out to be one of my favorites over time. Episode 4, saw the war between the sexes in full blossum, & the last two episodes is when the series hit its stride. The characters & their very strident differences came out in ways that you knew would make for a far better second season. The Barones will be very missed."
5,Haven't laughed this hard in years...,"I haven't laughed this hard in years. I love this show. Gotta love Italians and their love and humor of cooking!!! I love the sibling rivalry too. Despite the many jealous moments and fights there are, there are just as many hugs in this show. It's well balanced humor. I could watch ELR over and over again and not get tired of it. It lasted for 9 seasons which is phenomenal, and says a lot for the show. Thanks Ray for all the laughs you've given us."
5,Greatest family comedy of the 2000's,"I didn't watch Ray when it was still on Tv, I was too young and didn't really think watching old people on a show could be funny.I was ageist and regret that now because I LOVE, ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" The show transcends the ages and is classic comedy at its best, all the actors are perfect for their roles and their facial expressions and mannerisms are exact.I love this show and watch it everytime it is on tv in syndication and I own 2 seasons, about to buy the rest!!"
5,It's great entertainment,"It's the ""I Love Lucy"" of the 90's. When you want something fun, but not too heavy, pop it in. It's great humor and it's clean."
4,Excellent Start,"It was interesting to see how Everybody Loves Raymond started out. The first couple of episodes start out slow, but after about 4 episodes the show really picks up. Brad Garrett is absolutely HILARIOUS!!! Usually when buying a DVD from a TV Series I avoid the first season since shows usually find their voices and establish their identity midway through the second season. However ""Raymond"" has remained consistant. ROCK ON ROMANO!!!"
2,Great Video -- Poor Quality and Value,"I love the shows contained on this DVD. The plastic case was broken when I received it. The DVDs themselves were OK and it was too much hassle to call in and return, so I just taped the case back together. Two days after I received this, I discovered that Walmart sells the same DVD, plus the complete 2nd season of Everybody Loves Raymond, for the same price as I paid for just Season 1 at Amazon. Not feeling that great about my purchase here."
5,Awesome,I really like everybody loves raymond and so does the rest of my family. It made a good aniversery gift
5,Truth About the so-called War On Terror at Last!,"""Defeating Jihad"" is the only book, in fact the only piece of writing I've read that dares to tell the truth about the so-called War On Terror. ""Defeating"" honestly lays out what the real problem is: radical Islam. And the author tells us what to do to stop the spread of this doctrine of repression and terror.For any reader sick and tired of Bush, Blair, the Democrats, the Republicans, all these ""leaders"" in the War On Terror, and who wants a fresh honest look at what really is going on from riots in France, to bombings in London and Spain, from Iraq to Washington, Defeating Jihad is a must read."
5,An excellent book,"I have just finished reading Trifkovic's book ""Defeating Jihad"", which is very well structured and written.There are majority of people, Europeans and North Americans alike, who do not know and do not care what Islam is about and what it teaches, and the consequences of it. And that is dangerous! This is why both Trifkovic's books, ""The Sword of the Prophet"" and ""Defeating Jihad"" are important: to teach and inform; hoping that people will listen, read and act upon it."
4,Defeating Jihad: By Serge Trifkovic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It is well researched and provides a keen insight into the challenges facing the Western world today.The book goes a step further by providing specific, common sense steps for overcoming the enormous threat facing every American. A must read for those concerned about the growing threat of Jihad in todays world."
2,Don't bother.,"I have built a very nice home theater and music listening room. I am a believer in the potential of recorded music to create a 3 dimensional, holographic listening experience to match the stunning visual effects coming out of the high definition BD movies being released and to stand on it's own as a thoroughly entertaining medium. That's how I got sucked in. The titles of this artists work promise volumes but each track tells the sames short story over and over and over again...even from disk to disc. If you have to, pls only buy one of his works. I advise you to take my word for that fact that every one of his disks are identical in theme, compositional technique, etc."
2,Disc is a blowout. - BEWARE!!!,"This disc does not play dts - ES - 6.1 ( my receiver only shows a DECODE ERROR!),in fact it will only play 5.1 on my DVD-A player. Other dts-ES 6.1 discs play OK,ie. ""touch"" by M. Subotnik & ""Chicken Run"" are fine.I checked the disc out at a local stereo store and the same thing.!!The Disc ,bsides being technically inferior also lacks any 'musicality' not much better than a click track - just pops and farts!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
1,Deceiving,"The product information doesn't tell you that the tea includes processed sweetener (stevia), butterscotch flavoring, and some other processed ingredients.This is not the original recipe for Yogi Tea, though it implies that it is. Even on the Yogi Tea website, it doesn't mention the added artificial ingredients (I know that stevia is from a plant, but it's hightly processed for use as a sweetener).I love the old original yogi tea, but I would never buy this."
3,This tea is a mixture of different spices,"Although this tea is flavorful and tastes fine, I should have read the description more carefully. I was looking for pure licorice root tea. This tea has other spices added to it and the orange peel flavor is dominant and licorice flavor is muted. I am giving it three stars because the name of the tea should include some of the other spices. Read the ingredients listed before you purchase. Here is the description, ""Combined with a touch of cinnamon, orange peel and other carefully selected herbs and spices"" If you like these other spices then you will be happy. Otherwise, you might opt for a pure licorice tea and the box will say, ""Ingredients: Licorice Root"". That was what I really wanted, although this tea tastes perfectly good."
3,Good Tea but not Thai...,So I bought this tea thinking it was the same as the Thai tea that is served at Thai Restaraunts but its not. This tea is very coconutty which theres nothing wrong with that but its not the same restaraunt type if thats what youre looking for. You should buy this tea if youre looking for a cinnamon/coconut exotic tea.
1,Not my cup of tea,"Not my taste. If you like it spicey, you'll probably like it. Me, I like my earl gray. I'm old fashioned like that."
5,DELICIOUS!,"Mild, but not boring! Enough sweetness for most, but I still add stevia. I have given several bags away and everybody raves about it!"
2,Not the Best,"I didn't expect this to be so spicy! It smells great but when you taste it, it's nasty! I sweetened it as much as I could but it just didn't help. This is a shame since I like so many other Yogi teas. I'll have to pawn off the rest to friends and family now :("
5,Nice Toy Box,I bought this toy box for my grandson. It was easy to put togeather and came with all the parts! Wood and parts are very good quality and it arrived to my house in just a few days. I am very satisfied with all of it!JudyKidKraft Limited Edition Toy Box - Espresso
5,Toy Box,The toy chest seems to be well built. I like it will not close on your childs fingers and it has wheels to roll it around from place to place.
1,Broke in less than 6 months,"I was excited about this product after I put it together and filled it with toys. Now I'm very disappointed that the mechanism on the inside to make it close slowly has ripped off, exposing screws and ripping the ""wood."" I tried to reassemble it but it didn't work. I was hoping to return it but didn't realize I only had a month to do so. Disappointing because I have had such luck with Kidkraft furniture in the past."
5,Great Toy Chest!,"This box is solid wood, very sturdy, and easy to assemble. The tension on the lid is fully adjustable so it won't slam down on the fingers of children. We added a couple strips of felt to make it quiet when it closes. Very nice piece of furniture and super functional toy box. Highly recommend!"
5,Very pleased,Received product sooner than expected. Assembled easily. Seems quite durable. Holds toys and looks good. Manufacturer shows pride in product. Well done KidKraft.
4,We really like it,We bought this before Christmas and we love it. It looks nice in our bonus room and holds a lot of toys. Lid is sturdy enough to sit on and closes slow for safety issues. Would definitely recommend
2,Looks good but not sturdy,"This toybox looks very nice and I love the color. However it is not what I would expect for the price. The wood is thin, and the floor of the box will not support heavy toys. For this price I would expect a solid piece of wood to support toys. I ordered the item with the safety hinges, which once installed are very stiff and when closing the lid, pulled the screws from the frame of the box. Overall, I wouldn't recommend as I think you can find a higher quality toybox for the price."
2,Very badly constructed,"This toy box seemed like just what I was looking for for my two boys' rooms to store all of their toys. A little assembly didn't scare me. But it was very awkwardly put together, and the bottom panel is this flimsy cardboard, which ended up collapsing and falling down. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,Wouldn't buy this again because...,"After putting the thing together, the hinge was attached to the side piece in the wrong place, so it wouldn't line up with the predrilled holes in the lid. After calling KidCraft and asking for the replacement side, they sent the wrong piece. THREE tries later, I finally got the right piece. Since it was a ""safety"" hinge, I was very reluctant to drill new holes for fear it would no longer have that safety feature.The Kidcraft rep was very nice and helpful the FIRST time I called. After receiving the wrong part, though, I called again..and again..and yet again..before someone finally calledme back. For the hassle I went through and the price I paid, it's just not worth it. It took TWO MONTHS to get this thing right!"
5,Well built and looks good.,"This is one of the most well made pieces of non solid wood furniture I have ever put together. The instructions are easy to understand and are on larger pieces of paper compared to most furniture. The hardware is well made and I had no issues with assembly. Sipping was only $6.95 for me because it shipped from Dallas (100 miles away) and arrived 1 1/2 days after I ordered it. In fact, I received a notice from Amazon at it had shipped 12 hours after it arrived."
5,Kidcraft toybox - a nice product,"We purchased this toybox for our grandchild. It came well packaged. It took us about an hour to put together - probably a younger person would be faster. Directions were very clear. All parts fit together easily. Only comment we thought would help is at the end when attaching the last side, carefully turn the box on end, so that it is resting on the side panel. For us, it made the final attachment easier. Top hinge works well - lid won't fall down."
1,Broke after 6 months,"This toy chest looks beautiful and feels very sturdy, but broke after less than 6 months of use. Very disappointing."
3,3 stars for the end product,"I only give this toy box 3 stars because I finally got it put together. The ease of putting it together is a negative 2 stars. You really need the patience and an additional person to get this thing together. Once you get the three sides in place and partially screwed together, the bottom falls out. So, if you want to save some sanity, get a second person to help out! Other than that, it's pretty and very safe. At least I hope it is. I put it together myself."
5,"Nice looking, solid construction.","I do not understand all of the negative reviews on this toy chest. Ours is loaded with toys, some of which are heavy, and the toy chest looks great in the room. Great value as well...."
3,Watch Little Fingers or Expect Tears,It went together easily.It is nice looking - looks good in the den.It's nice EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.If your child closes the top from the side (which my son has already done) they get their fingers caught as it closes.
2,Love it at first but not any more,At first I loved this but then within 24 hours my husband opened the lid and lid broke from the safety hinge. Not happy with how easy that happened. Now we have a toy box that can not be used by my daughter.
4,Beautiful but takes assembly,"As someone who LOVES building IKEA furniture, I was undaunted by the need to assemble this piece -- but it wound up taking quite a few hours. It may be easier for more than one person, however (I was alone). That said, it came out beautiful, and it certainly seems sturdy (though my kid is only months old at the moment, so I have not lived through wear and tear!). Also, of note: This matches REMARKABLY well with the Babies 'R' Us ""Heritage Cache"" crib and dresser line (which also comes in cherry)!!! I had no idea when I ordered it, really, but it all looks tight and classy together. I recommend the whole shebang."
3,Has some issues,"When putting it together, one of the boards cracked. its really nice but they should really make the assemble a bit easier. Otherwise it works great."
5,SPIKE SEASONS ANYTHING,"I read about Spike Seasoning on a food blog and couldn't wait to try some. Unfortunately, Spike Seasoning was not available in my local hometown grocery stores. Thus Amazon to the rescue! After placing my order with Amazon my order was at my front door within 3 days of placing my order. This seasoning is awesome! I started out putting it on just vegetables as the name suggest, but soon ventured on to seasoning other things. It goes on just about anything and taste great. I have actually started using Spike Seasoning as a substitute for salt. It is low in Sodium and actually better for you than salt. It is not an overwhelming seasoning; it allows you to enjoy the natural good taste of your food. So glad I found Spike Vegit Seasoning. They also make other Spike Seasonings that are equally as good. Thanks Amazon for the Spike Seasoning and until Spike products become available in my hometown, I will keep you on speed dial."
4,food seasoning,I have used this product for many years. It's a good substitute for salt. It has a good taste and I use it wherever I would use salt. It's not a 5-star only because it tends to cake a little; but that's not a big problem and never stopped me from buying it.
3,Old,"the package came with the spice in one giant clump... we had to beat it on the couter to break it up, I think the product is old and had been shelf sitting for some time."
2,Not as great as thought to be,"This Hydration pack not only tasted horrible on first use (even after a nice rinse out) it has continuously tasted horrible throughoyut all of my rides since I bought it. The taste of plastic s nauseating . When you are riding for long period of time and you ojnly have plastic tasting water to drink, it will do, but should be avoided. I tried to rinse it out using lemon juice to no avail. It still tastes horrible.The pack is going to be absolutly great when it stops tasting so bad. The pockets are nice and the design is sturdy."
3,Backup item for my son's Camelbak,"Needed a smaller hydration pack for my son to take on an Encampment, this pack did the trick just fine and worked well for him. However, we let a friend borrow it to take to her camp about 2 months ago, she chewed the mouthpiece as if it were a piece of gum or something. :-( Saw the damage when she returned it, figured no big deal, just get another mouthpiece at Walmart... HA. No such luck. A person has to buy whole new bladder for $10 bucks just to get a new mouthpiece. Suddenly not such a great purchase any more. Not sure if better to blame Walmart for not offering mouthpieces or Outdoor Products for not having them available, but just putting it out there."
5,Nice,I was getting tire of carrying my water bottle and dropping it. So I finally brought this and I love it I wish I would have gotten it sooner. It has pockets where you can put your phone and keys. I fill mine up a day before half way and put them in the freezer and then I fill it up on the day so I can have cool water. I would recommend to always wash after every use.
3,Worked but not long battery life,Got this battery for my antique Palm Pilot. Worked but only had 2 1/2 hour battery life.
1,Useless,"I ordered 2 of this product for two old laptops, a Compaq 1720 and a Compaq Presario X1000. Both laptops run Win XP SP2. Despite the claims of being plug-n-play, neither card works in either laptop. In fact, plugging one of these cards into the 1720 laptop actually causes the PC to GPF into a ""Blue Screen Of Death""! And technical support from Q-Stor is laughable."
3,win 2000 drivers not present,"I tried tried installing the NEC drivers which according to the instructions in the package were correct. they did not work. I updated win 2000 to sp4 then installed VIA drivers which worked with generic external case and noname dvd rom. I also tried wduxb2500 external drive which worked great. I also was able to connect a usb ""human device interface"" which seemed to work ok. The sony usb floppy did not work (i suspect that is a separate driver issue). q-stor support pages were worthless as was enclosed documentation. I wasted way too much time trying to get this card to work."
1,CARD BUS ADAPTER NOT WORKING,"I purchased the Q-STOR QU2NCB USB 2.0 adapter for my Compaq Presario 2100 Laptop, hoping that I would have USB 2.0 availability which the Presario Laptop doesn't provide. In a word, the adapter never worked, only at USB 1.1 speeds. The instructions are sketchy. The CD does not initialize all required drivers. Q-STOR online is no help at all. There is a wire on the card which supposedly is to be connected to 5 volts. Where that wire is to be connected is unclear. I still have the card: money thrown away."
5,LOVE THEM,"Now my fav shoe to wear. After you wear them a few times, the shoes feels the best. Going to order another pair!"
5,Black Sandels,"Extemely comfortable, suitable for many occasions, cheaper than stores, perfect for people with ""foot issues"" who want something a tad more stylish...."
4,"It's OK, but the connection software sucks.","The high-gain part of the specification is correct. The range is good, and it works as expected with my WGR614v4. This is using Win2000 and USB1.1. The nice thing about the software is that it provides a good deal of information, I just wish it wasn't so ugly."
1,Didn't work for me,"Didn't work for me. Was connecting to a Linksys WRT54G which works fine with three other wireless devices. When I attached the Hawking adapter to my desktop PC (Win XP SP2, pretty standard machine), I noticed two things:1. Speed was slow. No matter how I configured it, I couldn't get throughput above 6 mbps.2. Unacceptable: The adapter kept randomly disconnecting every minute or two. It would reconnect, but it wouldn't stay connected long enough to do one large file transfer. Unacceptable!Sorry, Hawking!"
5,It's working great,"Bought this to use in an RV park with Wi-Fi, my SOB (some other brand) notebook wi-fi adaptor could not connect. I followed the simple instructions (Windows XP) and connected immediately. Moved it around a little bit to get the best signal, good to go!"
1,Not original songs.,"Just another sound-alike album hoping to fool people into buying it. Don't. Unless you prefer sub-par, elevator versions of your favorite songs."
2,Disappointed in DeLonghi,"I purchased this coffee maker because it was at a great sale price. I loved my DeLonghi espresso machine, so I bought the coffee maker.I'm so disappointed that I wrote DeLonghi customer service.-The filter basket and water reservoir are under the same flip-top lid, so it's very easy to accidentally get ground coffee in the water reservoir or to pour water into the filter basket (especially because of the peculiar shape of the water reservoir).-Removing the carafe from the maker is difficult and awkward. Half the time, when I pick up the carafe, the whole machine comes with it.-The water level markings on the carafe started to come off within about 3 weeks of use. (I use the dishwasher, but I don't use heated dry.)On a positive note, the plastic material the maker is made with appears not to stain, which is an improvement over my old Krups."
1,Not Teak Oil,I thought I was ordering oil specifically for indoor teak furniture. I have vintage pieces bought in Europe and this was listed as teak oil which I am afraid to use on my furniture.
2,"Got the job done, but it is pretty flimsy","I bought this tucker as a somewhat disposable carpet tool, since I just had one four foot section of carpet that needed to be tucked back under my baseboard. It worked great for three feet and then started to crumble. It is definitely cheap. I got the job done with the remaining bits of the tool, but I would not count on this tool lasting for a full size room and certainly not for a multi-day job."
1,Waste of Money,"This car charger came with the Inetec case, and although it looks very stylish, it has one very serious design flaw. It wouldn't stay in the lighter slot on either my wife's Saturn SL2 or in my Geo Metro! It was popping out so frequently that my wife and I were having to trade turns holding it in the slot so we could get the PSP to charge. If you really need a car charger, try the Pelican charger instead. It worked right out of the packaging, and was certainly a lot less trouble."
1,Worthless,"I agree with the first review. I found the Intec car charger to be completely unusable for the same reason - the charger would not stay put in the cigarette lighter slot in my Toyota 4-Runner. The product is unusable. I too purchased the Pelican PSP car charger afterwards, and it works great."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"THIS PRODUCT WILL MESS UP YOUR PSP'S CHARGING PORT. I had my PSP for less than a day before this device messed it up. I plugged in my PSP at work to let it charge. Then I plugged it into my car on the drive home from work using this intec device. Now, my PSP will no longer charge from the sony wall unit. Haven't figured out a way to fix this yet. Keep this 5 dollar piece of crap away from your PSP. It's a disaster waiting to happen."
3,"i loved the arab side, didn't click with the far east","anyone who wants an intro to arab-influenced music needs to listen to the first cd...great classic tunes, drummy house sounding tracks...apart from an egyptian version of mozart, it was nearly perfect.the second cd leaves a lot to be desired...no flow, no substance."
4,Great Carry On Bag,This bag is a great carry on bag for air flights. It's just the right size and easy to stow. I do wish it had an outside pocket for quick access.
1,Not what it used to be,"I am very disappointed with these bags.The duffles I bought 5 years ago are made of thick cordura with beefy fittings (they still serve me well).The new bags are about twice as thin--on everything including the fabric, the strap, the handles, and the buckles. One of the plastic fittings broke on the first day. The only ""improvement"" I see is the needlessly rubberized label that says ""built to last a lifetime."" Uhmm... I don't think so. Please bring the quality back!"
2,"tore open first use,","Very cheap fabric, without support on the handles. If you are any Good at packing the bag wont be able to hold the weight.But the bag looks like it is rugged. I did not look at the engineering until mine tore."
3,"Great for total beginner, I guess. Meh for anyone else","This book has a lot of useful, neatly-organized information in it. That having been said, most of it is what anyone with any fitness training experience would probably consider common sense. The dietary information in it is nice, making some good blanket recommendations, and the proposed ""how much time how many days a week"" workouts are very good ones. Again, however, they are mostly very common-sense items, and what's more, they rehash virtually the same information dozens (literally) of times. The book could easily be over 100 pages smaller and equally useful. It seems clear that they padded the page count with a lot of copy/paste in order to make the price seem more worthwhile. Now, I'm not trying to claim that the Amazon list price is excessive. The book is probably worth what I paid for it...but just barely."
4,Men's Health The Body You Want in the Time You Have:,"everything i needed including encouragement to keep training, on reaching an explained plateua, simplifies the whole gym ordeal and lets you do it in your time"
4,Friendly user book,This book is very easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 star is because I have to flip to pages every time I move on to other routine since I don't have many equipment to use. This book will show you how to work out even if you don't have any equipment and get same results.
5,Truly a life saver...,"For years now, I've been looking for that book to help me lose those unwanted pounds off my body. Although other books have slightly helped, no book has done the job that Murphy's book has. Within a few weeks of going through the exercises and routines that he discussed, I was able to shed nearly 10 pounds and go down a whole pant size! His book and the title truly go hand in hand... ""The Body You Want In The Time You Have!"". Having a full-time job while attending college to get my bacehlor's degree, the time I have is quite limited...but this book helps you figure out ways to work any routine into your schedule. Truly a masterpiece and highly recommended to anyone out there to pick up and buy!"
5,Self Boaring!,"These screws work really good with Kreg's drill bit with pilot hole tip (3/8"" diameter). It is self boaring so it doesn't split the wood. The coarse one works for soft wood like pine and plywood. Use fine screws for hard wood. Wish these screws were a little cheaper."
5,Best Pocket Screws,Great pockets screws. Work great in soft wood which I use a lot. Stick with the fine ones for hard wood.
4,Kreg product,make many things with pocket holes for quick and easy joints. you just don't know just how many screws you can go through untill ya don't have enough. the price was good here on amazon for a box of 1000. cant find local at such a nice price.
2,A Kreg is not a Kreg unless it has a Square Head... These are not square head screws...,"I just finished my 5000 piece box of Kreg Coarse 1 1-4 screws, which was purchased from Amazon earlier this year, and I needed a couple hundred more. So I thought this 1000 pack would be just fine. I was a little surprised when I open it and find a different style screw and screw head. These don't grab as well as the screws I just used up. The old screws would bury themselves through a piece of pine if you let them. These will strip out sometimes. But my major complaint is the Square-Phillips Combination head in these screws. The square drive does not hold as well as in my last square drive only screws. The fit of the ""square"" part of the pocket is not as accurate and leads to a sloppy fit. I also wanted the square only for my application and was not happy to find this subsisted without any mention in the description."
5,pocket screws,great price for the volume of 1000 screws- i like this package.I would buy these again .Kreg products havent failed me yet . thanks
3,Hit or miss on plywood,"I bought these coarse screws for some plywood based projects and find that used with a Kreg Jig, they often do not pull tight, but instead strip free with little torque."
3,A little cheap feeling but it works!,"It just works. What else could I ask for?I could ask for a better design, heavier plastic and sturdier connections but then I would expect to pay a great deal more."
1,If I were you ...,"Got mine in, connected it to my laptop, the driver installed automatically (or so I thought), then I plugged in my audio interface. Nothing happened. The computer could not find the interface. Turns out, there is a problem with the driver. After looking around their website, I found an e-mail addy for technical support. Pretty much the only information I got was that this was not a problem with the Vista OS. Absolutely no info in the e-mail of how I may rectify this problem, and of course, no volunteering to help me out. I am VERY busy, and had no time to send the product back once I discovered that it does not work. The fact that they would ship a card with a faulty driver and not go out of their way to help tells me all I need to know about their company. Plus, I had this card shipped overnight, so I would have been out that charge regardless of what I could have done."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this water for my small flock of chickens. Within two weeks the first handle broke. I was able to find a replacement handle so I gave it another try. This time I was very careful not to overtighten the handle as the instructions say. The second handle lasted maybe three weeks. I don't recommend this product. If you do purchase it, be careful when tightening the handle (only enough to create the vaccum) and be careful when you loosen the handle. Don't loosen while there is still vaccum as this causes higher torque and eventual fatigue of the cheap plastic handle."
5,easy to use chicken water-er,"This water-er works just fine. If you don't read the instructions, it's a little confusing to figure out how to control the water flow when you fill it... but it's really pretty easy. I'm not sure it will last as long as my metal waterer, but it works fine now."
1,junk,"Don't buy, cap broke after one week. Hard to keep clean.I've kept chickens for several years now and used different waterers this one is the worst.I will be throwing out the one that didn't break, I would'nt stick someone else with it."
2,lid cracked after one week,"works great until the lid cracks. i read many reviews online and thought i was getting the best plastic waterer available. the lid cracked in the first few days of use. i tried sealing the cracks. that worked for a couple of days. but the next time i tried to move the waterer, the lid cracked more. i am going to try the water nipples."
2,Broke after one month of use,The top lid developed a crack after only one month of use. We did not over tighten. I firmly believe that this design just does not work well long term.
2,water dispenser,"I purchased the water bottle and within a month it was not holding water anymore, it keeps leaking out. I called and they sent me a new one. That one didn't hold water at all."
5,for my banties :),This waterer has held up great and is the perfect size for my 13 Silkie Chickens. Durable and easy to clean. Works great with the durable handle since I have to walk to the spigot and fill it daily!
1,BREAKS! LEAKS!,I have purchased 2 of the largest waterers for my flock of 100 chickens and turkeys. The lid design is terrible and made of cheap easily breakable plastic. Moving it by the handle will break it in under a year. I have had to order 4 extra caps from my local feed store. I can't find the replacements on line. Entire unit easily gets hairline cracks in winter from freezing.Broke another cap today on here looking for parts. ::fuming:: - I have two waters over 50 bucks each that I can not use. Terrible price to pay for an item that is not dependable and that you can't find replacement parts for.Rubber gasket on mouth also buckles. Had to cancel a fishing trip one summer because the gasket buckled each time upon closing - breaking the air tight seal and let all of the water drain out. Couldn't order a new one before the weekend. Didn't want to come home to dead birds in the summer heat.Not purchasing another one. Going to try a different method.
1,Gross,"Fills with dirt, better off just using a bucket! Apperently I missed the return date? by 2 day or it would so be going back"
1,Very difficult to use under real life conditions,"While the concept might be good, the execution is not. Under ""labratory conditions"" I'm sure it worked well, but put it in a hen house where things tend to get a bit messy and it fails.The screw top has a big enough handle on it, so unscrewing it is OK, provided the threads are VERY clean when it was screwed on. You have to get it screwed on pretty tight so no air leaks in or all water will leak out, too.The unit is a pain to clean since the white water unit sits inside the red water tray. Dirt and whatever gets under and between the two pieces.All that I could have put up with if there would have been a way to hang this unit off the ground. I tried everything. No matter what I did (even drilled a hole in the side of the handle) nothing could successfuly keep the unit flat enough to prevent all the water from leaking over the sides.I bought two of these and trashed both within a couple months."
1,Not very easy to use and cannot do many things well..,"The Software claims to support many phone and allow sync with outlook. However its very difficult to use. In this age of smart phones, you have to visit their website support forms and read about ""phone not found"" to configure it for Android. They should have this in default help page.It can import address book and calender from outlook and phone but does not sync them. Now I have duplicate entries in the datapilot software. This seems to be task of novice software writer who is trying to sell an unfinished product. I am disappointed.Verdict: Do not waste your money on this product."
2,Datapilot Universal Pro Kit,"Seems to work well with the phones it covers, but although there are a lot of phones covered, there are a lot that aren't. Mac owners should note that Datapilot has a much more limited list of covered phones than those covered with the PC version; the Mac list is sort of hidden away on DataPilot's web site, but worth looking for.Installation and setup are simple, and I haven't yet found a phone that doesn't connect with one or another of the supplied cables."
5,Worked Great,"Worked great for older phones, Worked great for older phones. Thie Worked great for older phones. Worked great for older phones. Worked great for older phones.Worked great for older phones. Worked great for older phones. Worked great for older phones.Worked great for older phones.Worked great for older phones."
5,Works great!,Complete with all the cables that you need. Software GUI is easy to use. All my phone numbers are now backed up and this even downloaded the pictures from one of my phones.
1,Support for phones not equal,"Be warned, this product does not support all advertised features on all phones. Right out of the box I found it did not support 2 of our 4 cell phones. Of the phones that it did support, the only sync features available were photo downloading and calendar sync. The ability to transfer other data such as movies, contacts and ring tones were not available for my particular phone. Without all of the advertised features are available I consider this a complete waste of money."
1,"BUGGY Software, this is a HACK! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!",Getting the 'Administrator error' and from my internet searches I am not the only one. They have pages on their website dedicated to how to fix this (why don't they just fix the software?) and none of it worked. This is a fly by night hack software solution that is not supported fully and would be fine if they presented it that way and charged a nominal fee. This is not a real software solution and I whole heartedly discourage anyone from risking their computer with it or supporting a company that is falsely portraying itself like this.
1,Dave,"Hard to set up, they sent the wrong cable the first time, and the data transfer only produced marginal results. The customer service was ok, but the end result was not."
1,No company support,"I purchased my Datapilot about 2 years ago for a Windows XP computer. It worked okay but it seem hard to work through the software. I recently had to replace my computer and got a Windows 7 machine. When I tried to load Datapilot I needed to register the software. Because I had already registered it two years earlier it would not allow me to complete the install. I contacted Susteen by email explaining my problem. But got no response. When I tried to access my account it came back and said ""no such account"". I asked if the software would work on Windows 7 or if there was a software upgrade. But again No response. To my knowledge there is no support available for this product."
3,"Close, but not quite","It's pretty cool, but the interface to Windows leaves something to be desired. It's not user friendly but really not user antagonistic either, it's kind of like old Windows 3.1, it works, it's better than any of the alternates, but it could be so much better.Oh, and I never could get the download cables to work. They are not Windows XP compliant and the drivers drove my system nuts, the only thing I can use is the Bluetooth.Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this one again, but I didn't return it for a refund either.My recommendation is to wait for next version."
3,My son is complaining about a mistake.,"My son is upset because in this book the crickets are pictured sleeping in the night. Crickets, he notes, sleep in the day. We must all call HarperCollins and tell them to fix the cricket problem."
3,mass appeal = $,"This is a fine smooth-jazz type recording. Taylor is a brilliant artist and anything he does is beautiful. BUT - my heart lies with his amazing solo, chord-melody work. In particular, the 1992 recording ""Artistry"" (produced by Steve Howe of Yes fame). ""Artistry"" is astonishing, often sounding like two great jazzers playing together. You can't blame him for looking to make some bucks off the American smooth jazz fan base, but for my money, give me the one man with the ten fingers that sound like twenty. He's arguably the best there is."
5,Great sharpening stone,"The diamond stone cuts very quickly and efficiently and it's wonderful not having to worry about the stone wearing away over time and having to be leveled. I haven't tried the diamond stones for the finer grains, for which I'm still using Japanese wet stones, so I can't speak to the fine honing capabilities of the diamond stones, but the coarse diamond stone makes short work of the initial process of removing burrs and dings from the blade, the kind of work which can take hours with the finer Japanese stones. Clean-up is easy, they require no soaking, all in all, a very helpful and handy stone to have."
4,coarse diamond sharpener,"Useful if you have a tool that HAD an edge. This sharpener is similar to my #220 Arkansas stone. I will remove a lot of material in a short amount of time with little effort. I used it to replace the edge on a severely abused diver's knife. The previous owner must have been trying to slice barnacles. The advantage this has over Arkansas stones is it cuts faster (it feels like a file) and since it is diamond impregnated the 'stone' will not lose its shape.If your knife, chisel, etc. needs to be touched up, you should start with a finer grade of diamond and go to very fine for the finished edge."
4,For all you rock and roll lovers,"This is great music for all you rock n roll lovers. Quietly disguises the songs we all love, and is great for background listening and parties."
2,Not a stellar game,"While the presentation is great, the game itself suffers from a lack of definition in the Skills section, which is the core of the game. Too many skills are left vague and unquantified, which really leaves the GM to make their own list of skills from the suggestions in the book."
5,Fun for Kids and Fun for family,"My kids (Age:7&10) and I all enjoyed this book very muchsince we received in the mail from Amazon. Every night, we take turnreading to each other -- usually I go first and then the kids. Thekids enjoy all the funny ones and the wonderful drawings that Ashley had created. This is a really great book. My daughter even recognized a few of these poems as her teacher had shared with her class early this year."
5,walker's brilliance,"i love indy music, especially music that is as heartfelt and emotionally binding as this wonderful group of musicians efforts.from the depths of spain to the underbelly of rockaway beach, this album brings delight to the palate.go buy this album, if you are human enough to admit your insecurities and where they stem from"
4,A cookbook worth having,"It's not so much for the recipes that I am buying this cookbook. There are some fabulous recipes in here - the waterwhip pie crust, corn pancakes, glorified shrimp- but many of the preparations are not to modern taste or use ingredients that are dated (suet, lard, palm oil). No, the fascinating part of this little treasure is the history that binds it together. Not only is it snapshot of the 1950's, with its aspics and community suppers, and surprising reliance on convenience products of the time, but the African American history it preserves is precious in its own right. The pages on Robert Smalls alone are worth owning this book. The index needs work and the user guide recipe updates for modern use should have been included at the end of every recipe instead of burying them in a chapter at the back of the book, but after reading thru this once as a novel, I am ready to use it as an actual cookbook. But as a record of Black history thru the year, it is priceless."
4,Meaningful Gift,I gave my sister this book as a Christmas gift. With it comes history lessons and an appreciation for the foods of our childhood that still evoke wonderful memories of our ancestral struggles and comforts.Navigating Life's Roadways: Stories of Insight from My Odyssey and Inspiration for Your Journey
4,Waltz of Shadows,"Although a notch below his mature work as he concedes, Lansdale is in fine form here. One might want to read his later work first to be more forgiving about plot and character flaws in early work like this (for example in this book and ""Cold in July"", his protagonists are broadly drawn without the vivid personality of a Hap or Leonard in that series). Although the villains and their evil deeds are extreme in true Lansdale fashion, he anchors them sufficiently in reality to make them truly menacing, thus separating him from the majority of the thriller pack with their cardboard or unbelievable villains."
5,Fantastic read for newer to billards person,"I purchased several copies of this book for many of my friends and to be honest especially for my female billiards enthusiasts. It is well written, good common and understandble language and concepts, great drills for practice, an all around good read."
2,The book with more I's ever written...,"Yes, try counting the I's there... ""I did this"", ""I did that"". If you are a follower of Jeanette, go get it, her career is interesting. If you want to learn pool techniques, this one contains just a few interesting things and some trick shots: there are better books out there."
1,Racism at its best,The only people that will like this book are anti-white racists!!! The book puts forth the idea that all whites are bad and non-whites are victims. Non-whites should be offended even more then whites.
3,Overlooked masterpiece?,"Okay, maybe not, but far too many neglect this guilty pleasure when discussing the greatest disaster films of all time. All the stars are here, from Paul Newman, William Holden, and Ernest Borgnine to lesser stars such as Alex Karras (yes, the dad from ""Webster"" playing a character named -- no kidding -- ""Tiny""). The effects are horrible, the script devoid of original ideas or characters, and the concept predictable in set-up and execution. Still, we view films of this sort for those very things and it lives up to its billing as an exercise in cheesy cinema. In all honesty, all we care about in a film like this is: who dies and how gruesome will it be? Many stars do indeed bite the dust, so fear not. My only complaint (at least in terms of the video) is that it does not yet have a widescreen transfer."
3,Tony Land's Review,"This should have been a much better movie with all the talent in it, unfortunately it falls down in nearly all departments, not even the great actors could pull it through. The plot has been used in many movies but this one just didn't cut it, the director was obiviously off with the fairy's and the end result was to coin a phrase ""corny""."
2,Have you ever seen a volcano lay an egg?,"This was the last of the late Irwin Allen's all-star cast disaster movies. By the time this movie was made, the public must have been getting tired of viewing the glut of disaster movies made during the seventies. The cinematography and special effects don't look anywhere as good as the ones used in earlier IA films like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"". This is one of those films where I kept wondering to myself ""how much longer do I have to sit here and watch this thing?"""
3,"""when the magic ran out"" ,or not that bad","OK, this did in the careers of the director and producer Irwin Allen(nether would bring another film to the big screen) it really is just another rerun of all the disaster movies of the 70's , they just went once to often to the well. Still if in the right frame of mind this silly movie is fun to watch as in the first 5 minutes you can figure out who lives and who dies. If disasters are your kind of movies then you might like this one."
1,Mr. Maltin was correct about this movie,"It is basically a rehash of Irwin Alan's other movies, like the Towering Inferno. Only here the source of the disaster is an active volcano that threatens to destroy a new resort hotel. As before most people refuse to take the threat seriously and are eventually killed when the hotel is destroyed by the volcano. Only a few survivors led by Paul Newman will survive. Sound familar?!"
2,b moive b format,"any film buff will be happy with getting a movie on what ever format is still for sale,we would all like a blue ray copy of everything,but in the real world no chance.This then was the best copy of this movie on vhs at 141 mins,dvd cut to 109,as for the film rates two stars for full length,on a par with the 1980 film the island as why did they make it,no star looks happy in it,must have been the pay check.Story on an lsland when disaster hits is nothing new,but tv is so bad these days ok time filler,and is a bit of movie history"
4,Polyester and Mayhem Make a Good Mix,"When this film came out spring of 1980 it was uniformly trashed by the critics. Leonard Maltin in his movie guide gives it a BOMB rating. My reponse? Lighten up!!! This is popcorn entertainment and it works. I watched this on a Sunday afternoon and it was a great non-think way to while away the time. It doesn't rise to the camp level of producer Irwin Allen's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" nor is it as violently pornographic as ""The Towering Inferno"". The special effects don't rise to the level of previous Allen efforts but they're not bad. I was under the impression that the star-studded cast was in paycheck mode and that may be the case but it's not apparent that they're phoning it in. Noteworthy: How many films sport so many Academy Award winners (Paul Newman, William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons) and Oscar nominees (Burgess Meredith, Valentina Cortesa, Pat Morita). Probably ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" and maybe an ""Airport"" movie."
4,"Video 'When Time Ran Out""",Very good and fast service. Slight problem with PAL compatability (video needed very slight retuning to get colour).
2,Really bad special effects,"This is a horrible movie but perversely fascinating because you keep wondering how William Holden and Paul Newman could say their lines without laughing. And the special effects are so bad they're great! Especially when people fall from a great height into the volcano, which happens often. One poor fella seems to fall sideways from a helicopter into the lava. Makes the Towering Inferno look like North by Northwest. Extra cheese, please."
3,"It's cheese, yeah. But cheese goes great with bacon","I don't know why most people detest disaster flicks. I love them. To me, most of them are very interesting. This one builds up a little too slowly, and it doesn't have the main characters going through enough challenges. One also wishes that a second group of people would decide to leave the hotel and follow the group, led by Shelby. It would make her character more real to me."
4,Good effects and cast in cheesy disaster fun,"Not one of Irwin Allen's best, but overall a fun time with a huge all-star cast trying to escape peril from an erupting volcano. Good to see it arrive on DVD at last, but the mystery is why Warner Home Video isn't releasing the expanded 2 1/2 hour version they previously released on VHS, and which was shown on network television. They used the expanded version of The Swarm both on DVD and the older laserdisc releases (which actually made that one a much better movie), so since they're doing this release as part of a Paul newman tribute series, why the shortchanging for this movie when they obviously have the longer version in their archives?"
5,Exactly as pictured!,"Received 2 small (3.5oz) cans of endust electronics duster, so far works great.. like any other canned air used. Item arrive quickly as well!"
2,Emptied too quickly,"A 3.5 oz canister barely got my keyboard clean before it was out of air. I have had other products that lasted 10 times longer. Also, it is too expensive online--I found the same product for much less at Target."
1,Warning - this item is NOT for X series,"Be aware that the description of this item is incorrect, with the exception of the manufacturer's description line. This part is for the older ""classic"" series of Drill Doctors, NOT for the newer version that Amazon now sells. Only the models without the trailing X in the model number can use this. All of the lines above that say it is for ...500X, 750X are incorrect. It is the wrong diameter, as the newer wheels are smaller.Other than that, it may work fine, but it won't fit my DD, so I can't tell.Note: Amazon updated the description line to be correct now. However, they still list this as an accessory for the X series and list them in the ""better together"" link. Sigh."
4,Good Product,"The delivery was quick. Something I have come to expect from Amazon. The product is pretty cool. I found out about it in one of my software engineering books. The sheets come stapled together in a box; they were designed to go on an easel. I found that removing the staples and using the sheets that way worked the best. I have had one wall of my living room dedicated for a school project the last few months. They have proven to be very handy. As some others have said, they do not erase very well or easily. Using alcohol with a rag to erase worked like a charm. I would try and avoid using any of the color markers as they stain the sheets.In the future I think I will look for a long term solution. Actually having a large white board is nice. But for some one who is only looking for a short term solution, a few months, this is a great product."
2,Portable white board,"Very cool. Can erase if you use a white board marker. But curls up and doesn't ""stay put"" for as long as I'd hoped."
3,School Teacher,I saw these sheets used in a staff training that I attended at the beginning of the school year. I thought they were a great alternative to the chart paper since I was saving a tree; however they are difficult to erase. I've been told to use the regular (not the low odor) markers because they erase easier. I have to scrub with tissue to get the marker to come off when I use the low odor.As for the static cling...I was tolled to make sure I roll the paper up...this ensure the static cling. Do not fold the paper.
3,Works well in a pinch but not good for long term,If you are doing a quick meeting in a room that has no white board this will work. But if you want to use this in your office for brainstorming over a couple of weeks these will fall off the wall in a couple of days.
1,Not like the old stuff,"I'm sitting here with my last remaining scraps of an old Avery brand dry erase sheet product I purchased years ago and this product that I ordered recently. One expo marker. I can easily erase the marker from the ancient Avery sheet, hardly any comes off of the new sheet. I've tried expo cleaner, alcohol, acetone, vinegar, windex, 409, water and lots of elbow grease. What good is a dry erase surface that doesn't erase?"
2,Quality lacking,"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised due to the low price, but I was disappointed with the quality of this item.1. Sheets are VERY thin & tear easily.2. Almost impossible to get them on a wall without all sorts of creases, air bubbles, etc.3. Static charge doesn't hold up well. Mine were falling down after 2 days.4. This is especially true if you try to reposition a few times.Nice concept, good in a pinch, but not any sort of long term use due to the quality of the material."
2,Fair,"Super thin so it easily sticks statically as advertised, but didn't erase very well even with brand new dry erase markers. One time use would be ok, but that's not much benefit over normal paper flip charts."
2,Not as reusable as you'd hope,"I purchased these for my classroom. They cling well for short periods of time, a day or so. These sheets tear easily making it difficult to detach them from the pad. They are reusable. However, the natural indentations from writing and left over marks make reading from the back of the classroom difficult. You cannot reuse more than three or four times. Overall a decent product but very expensive when you look at how often you have to switch to the next sheet. I found some other stuff that comes in a roll, stays up because it's sticky and easily costs pennies in comparison."
1,Ineffective as a white board,"I was excited to use these, but found the marker didn't erase, it just smeared. I thought it might just be the brand of markers, so I tried a few. Same result with all of them. I thought it might just be that the writing had been there for a few days. So I tried erasing fresh writing. The result was even worse.My team will end up using these just like regular easel paper. Just more expensive. :-/ Very disappointing."
1,They were bad quality,They would not tear off the pad where its was perforated. It tore off at a angle and ruined the sheet. I expected a better product.
3,Doesn't cling for very long,It was okay but the sheets don't cling to the wall for very long. I would reccomend this only for very short presentations
3,White Board Easel Pad,"I was super excited when I got this because I have been looking all over for one of these! I had one a few years ago that I had bought at Staples and it had like 30 dry erase pages (but did not stick to walls) for about 25 bucks. This one is not as nice as the one I use to have because I've tried several dry erase markers on it and nothing seems to wipe off or erase nicely. It's always left with some kind of marker residue so I end up ripping the sheet off and throwing it away after it gets too yucky looking. The last one I had lasted 1 1/2 school years! This one, I don't see it making it that long. STAPLES what did you do with that awesome white board pad?!?!?"
4,Not bad at all,"I liked the idea when I saw it at the office. I bought some for home use (kids white board). It has actually worked well, except that you need to make sure your walls are ""smooth"". We overlooked the fact that our walls have some relatively-fine texture. The paper sticks well to the walls still, but writing on them, while okay, is not as easy as with smooth-finish walls.One paper fell off the wall after a couple of days of not using it. In other occasions, we removed papers and put them aside and then used them later on and they were okay. I think they have to be ""charged"" by using them, but I'm not sure :)Overall they're not bad."
3,Good for the price.,"They worked very well as far as sticking up on the walls without a need for tape, tacks, etc. My one complaint is that it was very hard to erase them. I finally just gave up and started on new sheets each time. I was using normal expo whiteboard markers, but I couldn't get it off easily."
4,"Very enjoyable - poignant, but uplifting.","I've been a de Lint fan for several years, my favorite being the Jack the Giant Killer stories. I thought this was a little different from most of his other works, in that it focused more on the Native American folklore. I was hooked from the beginning, and didn't want to put it down. I liked the intertwining of the characters and their storylines and the way that the stories were sometimes poignant and made me want to cry, but in the end, I felt uplifted and like I had been through a very satisfying experience. A must for any de Lint fan.P.S. I love the Crow Girls! Read this to meet them if nothing else!"
3,Trivia about this book,"Lt. Brian Smith of Austin, TX, was killed by a sniper west of Baghdad in early July 2004. When he was cremated, this book was burned with him, as well as a bottle of Dave's Insanity Hot Sauce."
4,Loved it...but could have used some editing.,"Absolutely loved this book...but would have gotten 5 stars if Mr. De Lint had cut down on all the characters. Loved the Crow girls, Jack, Cody, Bo...but a great example of what I mean is that instead of spending all that time with Rory, I would have liked more Lilly and Hank, which is whom I thought most of the story would be based around.Overall, this was a great story about good vs. evil, belief vs. not believing...A truly magical story involving some good action sequences, a bit of horror (Nettie and the Morgans was a truly chilling piece of the story)...I'm now a fan of the author and will seek out more of his novels.Definitely recommended!!"
4,"Flying over some, stopping short of others","After disapointment in Yarrow and Greenmantle, I found Flying able to lift my spirits. The characters were, as usual, too many, but are far more fleshed out and less one-dimensional than others. Some scenes in the book were exceptionally poigant and cannot be conveyed in words.(I won't give it away tho.=D) This book left me in a much better mood after the let down with de Lint's previous stories, but I'm still regarding Moonheart as his best."
3,"Beautiful fantasy, with one annoying feature","I love de Lint's work, and really enjoy reading him. The thing I don't understand is why he rewards selfish characters (i.e. Katy), and why *her* betrayal and horrible behavior is never addressed. (WARNING *SPOILER*!) If someone's behavior had gotten ME locked up for over ten years, you can bet I'd never want to see them again either! Kerry's guilt just doesn't resonate. As for the rest of it, I loved the crow girls, Raven and Cody - especially loved the scenes with Cody and the cuckoos - but just can't get over that one flaw - or the final disposition of the ...err, film tin."
5,"Original, Gripping & Beautiful!","Not having read Charles De Lint before, this book took me by surprise. I've read other books of his since, and this remains my favorite. It's original, gripping and beautiful: a trio of adjectives very few books merit. It also left me feeling better after reading it. The Crow Girls are reason enough to turn that first page."
1,"Did not last long. Good product initially, well packed, worked perfectly. For a while.","I was a little leery of purchasing a toner cart from an unknown source sight unseen at such a low price. First impressions are dependable, it turns outAfter a couple of weeks I felt more confident that the decision to purchase this toner cart was the right one.The amount of toner in the cartridge was disappointing, however. Instead of lasting 6 months to a year, the toner was used up in under 2 months.If Amazon allowed me to contact the seller, Kwick Toners, directly, I'd have taken the issue up with them but ease of contact is not a feature after a certain period of time.The subject line says it all for me.[ASIN:B00078VHCK HP C4092A, 92A, C4092, 4092 Compatible laser toner cartridge for HP laserJet 1100, 1100A, 1100se, 1100Ase, 1100Axi, 1100xi, 3200, 3200MFP,3200m, 3200se, Black Color (2600) Page Yield. ONLY SOLD BY: Best Deal Toner]"
2,Laser Toner Cartridge,"The products came without any instructions and one of the cartidges leaves some dots across the paper on the top, middle and bottom. Is teir any wy to exchange it?Thank You."
1,Malfunctioned out of the box!!!,"Buyers beware! This product was faulty right out of the box. Prints had a terrible streak on the left hand side, and were washed out right after the first print. It has been a complete waste of money, which tells me that when it comes to printer cartridges, you can only trust the real deal."
1,total garbage,"this is a terrible toner cartridge. I am disgusted with the way that pages are constantly getting stuck in the printer and there is usually a black mess attempting to fix it as well as another black mess on the pages. The picture looks like an HP product, but no, it is a cheap compatible cartridge that comes in generic packaging. I finally gave up trying to make this thing work but the return window just closed this week so I guess I get to keep it. lesson learned!"
1,Cheap Cartridge for Rough Copies and Drafts,This toner cartridge is definitely not for quality printing. It produces light horizontal lines across each page that is printed.
3,Paper jams,"The first few printings was fine, then it started to jam with every use. The whole stack of paper gets stuck between the cartridge, and it is darn annoying of having to fix it all the time. It might be the cheap recycled paper I'm using. The only upside is that the ink does not smudge and it looks smooth. What's even more odd is the packing I received is different from the image here."
1,"Bad product, excellent customer support","I'd really hate to give this seller bad feedback because they refunded me ASAP due to a defective toner, but I figured I should let people know to be cautious when buying these ""compatible"" toner cartridges.Shipping was quick; unfortunately, the toner was defective. I tried printing documents and got horizontal lines on every single page. I tried all of the normal method of fixing and none worked.I contacted the seller and they got back to me very quickly, apologized for the problem, and offered wither a replacement or a refund right away. I went for the refund and I'll most likely just replace my printer as it's just too old anyway.So the one star is for the product itself but the customer service should get 5 stars."
4,"Matches Perfectly, but Difficult to Work With","These plugs are red oak, and they matched all of my recent oak projects perfectly. However, the moisture content varies considerably between plugs, meaning that some fit and others are too snug to go in. The Kreg website suggests microwaving the plugs as a workaround to this common problem, but in my experience that did not work. As a result, I had to sand some of the plugs, and discard another 5-10% that were simply unusable.Also note that the Micro and HD jigs are not compatible with these plugs. Kreg used to manufacture micro plugs, but I haven't been able to find those in any stores (including Amazon)."
1,Not usable,These plugs arrived scattered throughout the box the Kreg jig was shipped in. Their container had been crushed before it was shipped. Many of the plugs were split and the ones that were not split were too rough to use. I put these plugs where they should have been from the beginning; in the landfill. I like the Kreg jig OK but these plugs were totally unusable. I went to Home Depot and purchased a box of plugs made by a different manufacturer. They are in excellent shape and very usable. I have made many purchases from Amazon over the years with great results almost every time. This item though was literally garbage. I suspect the reader has gathered by now that I do not recommend these plugs.
5,Great Plugs,These are great plugs. They cover up those pocket holes and are barely noticable. I need 6 more words to ...
2,!!!,"I got 2 of Bootsy Studded Glasses yesterday...One of them was broken during the delivery.Because the paper in the box even didnt cover the 2 glasses.Those were for my friends, soCould I get a new one? or I could get the refund??I already took pics of them if you wanna see..."
4,Solid purchase,"The mat is made with durable material. Came smelling like plastic but I just hung it out for a night and the smell disappeared. Very good mat, washes well in a washing machine with bleach if necessary."
1,Would not recommend,"I ordered this product for it's style and cost. I have a slight texture on my bathtub and the suction cups did not stick AT ALL. The mat also had a strong vinyl smell; more than usual. I aired it out in the garage for a week before bringing it into the house. It continued to smell after a week of usage. My family complained so I ended up putting it outside. I hate to throw it away, but not sure what else to do. Really disappointed."
2,Poor translations,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Constance Garnett ruins Chekhov for me.Her work is reprinted for financial reasons, not artistic ones. Want to read ""good"" Chekhov? Read Robert Payne or Ann Dunnigan's translations. Yarmolinsky is good too.Rosa La Luna"
4,not all my favorites but a fairly good selection,"I'm a big fan of Chekhov's earlier, shorter stories, which are more plot and less ""atmosphere"", like the earlier selections in this book. It's clear to see how the early 1880's Chekhov was influenced by Guy de Maupassant's stories , an influence he acknowledged. Chekhov is equally adept at dealing with both serious and comical themes in his fiction. And although he's best known for his plays, his finest stories too stand the test of time, both in re-creating a historically accurate portrait of Russia and its people in the late 19th century, but also in giving us memorable characters and their stories to enjoy. Although his stories are often sad or tragic, Chekhov writes about these Russians with a real sympathy and understanding that is endearing to the reader. This collection of over 30 of his stories covers the span of his whole literary career, from the early 1880's to 1903, the year before his death.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
4,A great tribute to the men who flew with death everyday,"This book is very interesting. It concerns the day to day activities of a helicopter crew chief. His insights into military life under harsh and harrowing conditions provide a civilian a window into the gut feelings and fears that stalk a youth faced with death on a daily basis. No one knows how one will ""hold up"" in the line of fire, but this tribute leaves no doubt how Jim ""Mac"" MacLaughlin handle it...with courage, dignity and honor."
5,"A woodworkers, gardeners and chef's dream!","I have been using DMT's sharpeners for years and can't find a better product out there! In the kitchen, its perfect because I never have to buy new knives, I can simply sharpen them and know that they will last longer. In the garden, my wife enjoys the sharp edge on her pruners when she sharpens them. About five years ago I bought her a pair of Felco pruners. Knowing that I wanted them to last, the DMT sharpener allows her to use them year after year without worries. I can't believe I used to sharpen mt scissors and knives without one of those slide through sharpeners. These diamond sharpeners are great."
1,Not my style,"This book did not appeal to me because most of the cakes were a little over-the-top for me. I really loved all of her other books and thought this one would appeal to me in the same way. There are several great cakes in this book but I was overall, unimpressed."
3,Colette's Wedding Cakes,"When I first got started with cakes I got this and was really wowed. But now I see that someone needed to tap her on the shoulder and tell her to STOP with all the stuff on the cakes! She takes a good thing and way over does it. It still has a lot to offer, just remeber to take off about half of what she has put on the cake. There is a lot in this book that you will NEVER EVER do as is would take you months and months (a lot of these were done for photo shoots on cake dummies). Not a beginners book at all."
3,Wonderful Wedding Ideas,"i enjoyed the majority of the cakes shown in this book, though some just weren't my style , it gave me some ideas for my own wedding cake . This book is a good purchase for cake lovers or even someone planning their own wedding Colette Peters is definatly a master of her trade!"
1,out dated,"I think this is colettes first book. It is pretty outdated and is full of cakes that are very old fashoned. I love colettes cakes, but I particularly love her new ones."
3,Colette's Wedding Cakes,"Hmmmm, what can I say. The pictures were fabulous, but the wedding cakes would be extremely difficult to cut and serve. However, you can use a few ideas I suppose. For me, this was too far out to be practical for the home wedding cake baker -- only those who have a lot of time on their hands and nothing better to do than play. I cannot see an average couple wanting a wedding cake like these. Sorry."
2,Beautiful.....but unrealistic,"The cakes in this book are beautiful, but are meant to be created by professionals. There are too many non-edible items that need to be removed from the cake before serving. Impractical."
4,A little ostentatious,"The cakes in this book are absolutely beautiful, but a bit more decorative than most people will want. Further, they were personalized for the weddings for which they were made. I do recommend this book as a great starting place; it is inspiring, and it includes a lot of good tips and techniques. And for the couple who wants a really over the top cake, this just might be your book."
5,Awsome hydration pack!,"I absolutely love this hydration pack. It has one large and two small pockets and two quick stash pockets with the bladder in its own seperate pocket on the back. The large pocket has a space for a discman and has a headphone port. Furthermore, the bladder is very high quality and I haven't had any problems with it. The bladder and hose are easy to remove so it is not hard to clean it. Also, this pack is offered for a much better price than the overpriced camelbaks. All in all, I think that this pack is definitely worth the money that I paid for it."
3,"Good pack, bad storage vessel",I agree with the other review about the reservoir. Both the connection to the hose and the seal around the opening are poor. I replaced my reservoir with one by camelbak. The bag itself is great. Took it to burning man last year and it worked perfectly. If you're going to get this bag be prepared to buy a new reservoir.
2,"Nice bag, leaky reservoir","I like the size, design and pricing for this bag. Unfortunately, upon my first time using this bag, the connection to the reservoir bag was leaky. Not a little leak, but within a few minutes, there would be a puddle where the bag stands. I tried switching the tube around and it still leaks. Then I found out that the connection to the mouthpiece leaks as well. I emailed Outdoor Products but got no reply. I resorted to lining the connections with saran wrap to fill up whatever gaps were there to cause the leak and that seem to fix the problem for now. Now I'm considering a Camelbak instead."
4,Repeat buy,"I have a similiar pack, really enjoy it. Use it for biking and hiking, got this one for my girlfriend and she enjoys it as well"
4,Good pack,"Use it for survival, quick B.O.B., hiking pack. Great for price, holds enough liquid for 1 person for a medium day of packing. Great instant bug out bag, of course, only for quick emergency."
1,Garbage bags May be Stronger,"I purchased this for a recent trip to Iceland. The bag arrived and in theory, this bag is awesome. I was happy with it upon arrival. However, within two days one of the straps teared off at the seam and was held on only by a string, and after another day, another strap teared completely off. There are many cool little compartments for various things, and the hydration pack part worked okay, but the quality and durability of the pack itself is crap. I basically bought it, used it for 10 days during my trip, the thing fell apart, and now I can no longer use it. Complete waste of money. SPend a little more and get a camelback."
3,Its okay,"I use this bag for everything except.I use it for carrying things, i use it for travel. I use it for comfort. I do not use it for drinking. The water portion of this bag taste terrible. I rinsed it and washed it several times and I could taste this weird taste. Then the mouth portion broke. It broke on my first trip. I still use the bag because of the compartments and it is comfortable to wear when I travel and hike."
5,Great Pack. Great Purchase.,"I bought this pack a while back and have used it several times since. Its great for quick day hikes and has extra pockets for snacks, socks, first-aid kit, etc. It is easy to use and has a great price. I think one guy commented on the water tasting bad when he first used it. In my opinion, common sense should be to rinse it out before using. Overall, I couldn't be more happier with this hydration pack!"
2,"Poor Design, Shoddy Quality","This is a poorly designed bag and the quality leaves much to be desired.The hydration system is difficult to use and you really have to suck on the tube to get the liquid flowing. Other designs have a valve that opens releasing the pressure in the bladder, making the flow more easily. Quality was poor; there were numerous stitches that were loose and frayed,making the durability of the bag questionable. The neoprene hose cover was torn in two places and the removable clip (to hold the tube) was missing.I bought this instead of the more expensive Camelback, but you get what you pay for. I do not recommend this bag and advise that you spring for the extra coin for a better quality product."
3,Sizing again!!,"I've tried the cut it open with the kitchen knife and the sharpest cutter, I could fine. And Yes! it's passed!! For gripping things is good but not for the fishing hook, can get stab so easily!! so be careful. Another thing with the size, my hand measurement is 3 1/2 inch across 7 1/4 long, but the Medium size is slightly big!!"
2,Not for baby-boomers,"I bought this CD because of the great cover Shawn Mullins does of George Harrison's 'What is Life.' However, the rest of the songs -- some of which are rap -- are not anywhere near as good. Cheryl Crowe's cover is very thin. You'll find yourself hitting the skip button on your cd player a lot."
1,With this gun's roses version on it makes it a must not buy,"The Chereyl Crow version of Child of Mine is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever even heard guns and roses. I knew they were broken up and are not coming back, but this complete mockery for a remake should be called a copy. It has no original style like a remake does. It's a copy by someone who can't do hard core rock in your face which all miss. Guns and Roses was broken up but this copy kills them."
3,Decent album from a decent movie,I bought this album b/c after watching the movie at the end I heard what i thought was gasp Guns N Roses! But it wasn't the original track b/c i have heard that many times so i thought maybe it was axl roses' NEW MATERIAL! finally but after buying the album i realized it was only sheryl crow. It's a decent cover of the song but ur better off just downloading some of the very hard to find guns n roses new stuff or just buying Appetite for Destruction if ur into Guns N Roses. the other stuff on the album is decent and makes this album worth about half of what i paid for it. It's also missing the Styx song from the movie.
4,PRETTY GOOD LIKE THE TALKING WORTH BUYING,"also ,music fan from ohio spelled success wrong, i think, please don't be mad @ me though i'm a horrible English speller. this cd is good and Rob Shniter should get more recongnishion(see what i mean about spelling) but N E wazzze lots o famus poeple and achomplished artist create a great medly of songs dat i like to call....... ... nice/? buy it for Rufus"
5,I loved the movie as well as the CD,I thought Big Daddy was a great sucess and the CD was great movie Big Daddy is a must see movie.Have a nice day:)BYE
3,Good,"I haven't heard the rest of the songs, but ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" and ""Just Like This"" are definite winners."
4,A great listen!,"I really like Garbage and Rufus and even Limp Bizkit so if you like any of these bands you'll like this cd...and even if you don't like them you'll love this cd! It's really good and the sound clips from the movie make it even better but I agree, Sheryl Crow didn't really help."
4,Better than average soundtrack,"Sheryl Crow's cover of Guns 'N Roses Sweet Child 'O Mine strips it of some of its guitars, but none of its emotion. It's the standout track of many good ones on this CD. There's also Rufus Wainwright's suitably quirky take on Instant Pleasure, Garbage's not new but still welcome When I Grow Up, the Wiseguys silly but fun Ooh La La, a decent cover of What Is Life from Shawn Mullins, and an interesting and surprising rock number, Ga Ga, from Melanie C. (Note to the Amazon reviewer, though: she's Sporty, not Scary.)"
3,one song wonder,I purchased this cd for one song while I was watching the movie i heard this song and loved it song is only love can break you heart the version on this cd is the best I have heard
3,A good cover (is still a cover),"Had Sheryl Crow tried to duplicate Axl Rose's vocals or Slash's guitars on her cover of Guns 'n Roses' Sweet Child 'O Mine, she would deserve a thorough thrashing. As it is, her version of this now classic song is a worthy homage that while not improving on the original does approach it from a new angle."
3,um . . . what's up with that?,"sheryl crow shouldn't sing that song. i loved garbage and limp bizkit and mel c (extra ultra mel c) and a few of the other songs, but i don't think it was worth my money. it doesn't really catch anything, and it's thin."
2,"Funny movie, bad music","The CD was okay -- I bought it because most good movies have good soundtracks. Big mistake. The only even remotely good song is ""Just Like This"" by Limp Bizkit. There are some other good songs, like ""When I Grow Up,"" and ""What Is Life."" There are a few funny clips from the movie, but they're only about 10 seconds or less apiece. If you want Adam Sandler humor, buy ""They're All Gonna Laugh at You!"". If you want Limp Bizkit, buy ""Significant Other."""
5,Garbage Made the CD,"If you buy this soundtrack, buy it for GARBAGE. That's the only song I really like."
4,Fantastic watch,"This watch is fantastic, however, the band is very stiff at first. may not be suited for someone with sensitive skin. Otherwise it great!"
4,Rocking Chair,"This was purchased for our granddaughter's birthday. The night before the birthday my husband started to put the two pieces together. Problem! The seat part of the chair did not have the necessary pieces to hold the screws from the rocker part. The company did send another seat as quickly as possible but, of course, not in time for the birthday."
3,Christmas Present,I got this for my 18 month old grandson and he loves it. He is spends a good deal of time in it rocking. The chair is a little larger than I thought but that means gives him longer to enjoy.
3,Granddaughter enjoys her own chair,"Bought for our 15 month old granddaughter, she got right up in it and loves rocking her stuffed animals."
4,Great rocking chair,This rocking chair brought smiles to my grandsons faces on Christmas and it arrived in great time and was easy to assemble. It is very sturdy and will not tip over easily.
5,Child's rocker,Rocker is very sturdy and well built. Was extra easy to assemble and everything fit very tightly together. Finish was perfect and craftsmanship was as good as any I've seen. Will buy several more of these same rockers as more grandchildren are born! Love it!
1,Poor quality,"Very poor packaging, it was broken in two places. The chair was extremely light due to the flimsy size of the arms, spindles in the back and seat. The wood was also dry and splintered. I would not recommend for anything other than a decorator piece."
2,It is So So,"On the Jet 14 inch bandsaw the guides will not mount properly if your saw has the post with a 'V' notch running its length, the guide will fit but but it will not center properly. The upper guide can be mounted upside down after turning the mounting post 90 degrees but then the post locking knob will not secure the post properly. You can always replace the post with a full circular one.I would not recommend this guide system unless it is modified. Nor is it a worthwhile device if you change blades often. Adjustments require the use of three different size metric allen wrenches and the adjustments for the lower guides are a pain to get to.I have gone back to my 'cool blocks."
3,Its ok for the collection.,"When the big stride in Yes was everyone doing a solo album. Alan White I guess felt compelled to put one out too. This a kinda jazzy,rock album.I mainly got this cd because of the rarity of the album. White has good players,but the band really did not reach their ""mark"". As compared to Howe,Squire,Moraz, even Anderson's. (Which took a long time to listen to) White's Cd has to grow on you. Get for the collection, you may not see it again! White's drumming is always consistant,but the rest of the musician sound like they are really making an effort to sound good.Go to you tube,judge this yourself.But again get it!"
3,"Not as good as when a member of Yes, but...","Together with Carl Palmer from ELP, Phil Collins -either with Genesis or as solo musician- and the late Keith Moon from The Who and John Bonham from Led Zeppelin, Alan White is one of the best drummers of 70s Rock. This album, a solo effort with other musicians out of the lines of Progressive/Symphonic Rock, may not be considered a very good one as the other solo efforts from the original Yes members (i.e. compare with ""Fish Out Of Water"" from bassist Chris Squire or ""Olias of Sunhillow"" from singer-leader Jon Anderson). However I will play my bet for purchasing it as a Yes fan item, as well as for purely sentimental reasons."
5,Interesting,In this day and age when civility sorely lacking I thought it would not be a bad idea to brush up.
4,Just checking it out...,"I purchased this on a whim because it came up in a workshop discussion. I've read the summary on it's interesting to see the what has changed and what remains the same. Generally, if we all lived this way, the world would be a kinder, happier, friendlier place."
5,"If the whole world read this book, and played by the rules, we would have peace.",I had borrowed this book from a friend and finished it and it was so good I thought I should have my own copy to read at random from time to time to remind me again of basic rules of civilized living. These are all things our mothers taught us but we didn't always pay attention or forgot along the way. It's a classic that everyone should read and take to heart. I couldn't believe that George Washington actually took the time to write all of this down in such concise form.
3,Entertaining read,"I could not put this book down and have just ordered several copies for my friends. The sensitive reader will consider some portions of the book to be Bush bashing, the informed reader will consider those sections completely entertaining."
1,Freely available,"George Washington is one of few people in the history of the world to lead a major revolution for freedom and then not ""betray the revolution"". For that we owe him all the reverence he gets and then some. But as to his being some sort of brilliant 14-year old with these tremendous insights, it's not correct. Washington copied these rules from a translation of a work produced in the 1500's by Jesuits. The Jesuits actually had a few more. Unfortunately, we can't really give him credit for recognizing the importance of the rules and feeling a need to copy them - the copy was most likely assigned as an exercise in penmanship.BTW, the rules are available all over the web for free."
4,"Ageless advice for ""civil"" conduct.","Whether this little 30 page book is worth the price or whether George Washington copied these as a penmanship excercise from an english translation of some 16th century French Jesuit writings is immaterial.After you read these ""Rules of Civility"" you will feel like carrying this little red book around with you and handing it to rude people to read Rule # 1 ""Every action done in company aught to be with some sign of respect to those that are present.""How can our kids and grandkids get exposed to this kind of thinking?"
4,Great Book for Boys,"I bought this book on a trip to Washington DC. I was facinated with the book, but I had no idea that my 4 year old son would find it so interesting. Boys love rules and they want to know what the rules are, who made them, and why. Although a lot of the rules are somewhat dated, most can still be applied to daily life. My son loves to have these rules read to him and reminds me when I break one. If he remembers even one and hesitates to break it in the future then the book will have been worth its price."
3,For a first book...not bad at all.,"Now this is an interesting book, especially for a first time sci-fi writer. The author creates an interesting and detailed universe as well as interesting characters in it. Granted, some of the lead characters are fairly typical (for example, the lead male character is a bit of a Han Solo clone), and the plot starts with a familiar hook (the lead female character has amnesia, and can't remember any details of her past). But as the story unfolds, I found myself interested in finding out where it was going (and any book that keeps me turning the pages to find out where it going is a good book in my mind). A couple of complaints though; this book starts a little slow and predictable, and the ending is a bit muddled (however, I hope that any confusion from the ending will be cleared up with the sequel...). Overall, a good effort for an initial novel, and well worth a read."
3,Interesting but I'd hoped for more.,"I found that this book didn't live up to my expectations.I relished the character of Morgan and hoped that he would prove to be more than he eventually was. Great potential but a ho-hum finish.Sira was interesting, but in an author imposed fog most of the time, and I felt that none of the other characters were particularly sympathetic or compelling.The concept of the M'hir was new to me and I liked the idea of the Clan that could exist in both the M'hir and our Earthly domain, but the ability to travel through space to a remembered spot is not new or well done.I stayed with the story, waiting for a surprising or exciting finale and felt let down."
5,Thousand words for stranger - awesome,"I ordered this part of the trilogy, I found the other two parts elsewhere. I started reading this one, and I could not stop...The suspense, never knowing what was going to happen, and who Sira would turn out to be...A great story. Read the other two parts, pretty much back to back, non-stop. I have read most of the rest of Julie's stories - they are all deeply rooted, with rich characters, and amazing things happening. Her imagination is incredible. Read this book!"
4,"Good first effort, confusing ending","I was given this novel as a gift. It was certainly an interesting read, and I think most people who like science fiction literature would enjoy it. The ending was very confusing, and I'm still not sure exactly what happened. The ending is the only reason I wouldn't give this book 5 stars, though. Definitely worth the read, and I hope the sequel clears up some questions I have."
4,"Muddled ending, read the sequel","I found the book interesting it that I wanted to find out what was going on, but the ending was unclear and exactly what was going on was confusing. Something to do with the reproducing cycle of Sira. It does make you want to read the sequel if just to figure out what was going on it this book. Which I suppose a first book in a series should do. Overall, I give it a average rating. Not a book I'd read over and over again."
1,Questions and Wonder,"""A Thousand Words For Stranger"" left me seething with questions and filled with wonder. The main questions is ""Did anyone read this book before it was published?"" Clearly not.The wonder is ""Why would anyone publish this book?"" The characters have all the flavor and life of cardboard at the bottom of a tomato crate. The plot fails engage even the most determined reader (I tried, really, but I had to beat myself witha stick to finish it.) The best thing about this book (other thanit's modest length) was the author's last name. I liked that."
4,Interesting and quite good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have already picked up the sequel. This is a character driven story, with nice world (or Universe) building, and a bit of romance. Relax guys - I'm a dude and I can tell you that the romance adds nicely to the overall story and is not overdone. I actually read the Stratification prequel series before reading this and I can definitely recommend it."
2,"Great movie, bad copy","This is probably the worst version of the best movie ever made. I give two stars instead of one because the movie in it's essence is fabulous, the print is just shameful. You can't read some of the title cards as they are copied to largely to fit on the normal television screen. The quality of the transfer is so bad it can be hard to watch. Considering the restored/authorized version exists, no one should ever purchase the ""Hollywood Classics"" print. The restored version looks fantastic, has interesting featurettes about the making of the film, has title cards you can read, and has detailed descriptions of the scenes that aren't included in the film as they have disappeared through damage/fire/degredation. If you want to purchase this film, do yourself a huge favor and buy the restored version so you can actually watch the film."
5,An Algebra Book,I enjoyed using this book. It involves computers and it has many real life stituations. It is great for students who are just learning algebra or if they are relearning it. I would definitly recommend it for any classroom.
4,"if you're reading this, you should buy this album","solid musicianship, solid songwriting, a variety of styles, terrifc, compelling vocals. you even get a song from the viewpoint of a migrating whale and a song about slowing down on a fresno-area twisty road--what more do you want? if you need a frame of reference for the sake of comparison, they are more traditional than, say, the beachwood sparks. if you think you don't like ""country music,"" you must be thinking about that swill nashville pumps out. this ain't that. check it out."
2,"plastic, plastic, plastic","If you are like me and expect something called ""satin nickel"" to actually be metal you too will be sorely mistaken.The entire cover is plastic, and looks like plastic from across the room. The only thing worse than plastic is plastic pretending to be metal. I would recommend looking elsewhere."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This chime is what you would expect for $25. It comes in packaging that I could easily see hanging on a peg at Wal-Mart. It feels and looks very cheap but it does work. The ""satin nickel"" finish is not shiny and smooth as pictured. It is certainly not for finer homes. If you have a low budget, aren't concerned about appearance, and just want one that does the job, this is the chime for you."
4,Mini Biscuits,Small specialized size biscuits for the DBJ50 Joiner by Ryobi. They are a good biscuit quality.
5,recommended,"I bought two of these refurbished shavers, one for myself and the other for my friend. I find the shave is very clean, and the battery can last 2 weeks with one charge. I've got those for about half a year now. Both shavers are working perfectly."
4,Great DVD player -- great price,"I've had this DVD player for over nine months and have had absolutely no problems with it. It's played everything that I've wanted it too, so I've encountered no compatibility errors. I was able to hook it up into my stereo without any trouble and the sound is great. It's got MP3 playback, and accepts CD-R and CD-RWs, which is a handy feature, though one that I rarely avail myself of. It's pretty basic compared to all the ultra-expensive models that are on the market, but for the price, it's a great deal. All I ask of my player is to run DVDs and to be able to hook it through my stereo. For both of these, this DVD player is excellent, and the other features are icing on the cake."
2,Celebrity Roast,These shows are boring and shallow. They are not even funny. I was very disappointed. Ordered because I am a fan of the star that was featured but was sorry I wasted the money.
4,Cute Christmas Play,"I was actually in this play as Tenyin, so I might be a little prejudiced, but I thought that this play was really cute.It's about a girl named Tenyin, who is the daughter of an emperor or Japan named Matsu Suinin. She has this dream one night of baby Jesus and Mary and Joseph- the entire Christmas story. She decides to present it to her father as a birthday present, and he gets REALLY ticked off, and says that HE's the best, and the greatest, etc.The only kind of tense part is toward the end, where Matsu Suinin goes off into his yelling/screaming spiel about his supreme significance and hits one of Tenyin's sisters (the one who's deaf and mute). It stays 'G' rated throughout the entire thing, though, and I would definitely recommend this if you wanted to have something to perform for little elementary kids or for a family thing. It works out great for that- it has a really simple set."
1,Disappointed with HP's Jornada 568,"To be clear, I am a big HP fan, (I own their laptops both at work and home) and I've used the Jornada 547 before I upgraded to the 568. But I'm VERY disappointed with the performance of the new 568. I've had it one week and let me tell you the glitches. First, I've had to reset the device at least once per day. Second, sometimes it turns off/sometimes it doesn't after pushing the power button. (that is simply unacceptable) Third, sometimes the backlight works when it's supposed to, sometimes it doesn't. The Activesync w/ Avantgo has been highly unreliable, perhaps 1 out of 3 times (max) does it sync successfully. The last time it synced up, it erased the settings/channels that were set-up w/ Avantgo. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED, because I had really high hopes and expectations. Sure, the chip is faster, but you know, it's still croaking under the weight of the software. HP has really let a long-time customer down."
4,"GREAT, BUT 2 DRAWBACKS","I really liked the features once I was able to get it set-up - it came with a USB cradle and my laptop, 2 yrs old didn't have a USB, so had to order a serial cable - was very difficult to set up thru serial cable, but managed it with phone call to tech center because documentation doesn't address this option. THEN, the case is so slippery that it almost literally jumped off the book it was laying on when titled just a degree or so, threw the battery out and lost all the data - TWICE. To me, this is a major drawback which i guess hp expects you to get around by purchasing one of the leather, etc. cases for the handheld. i didn't want to spend the money because its the SLIMNESS of the product that i like, so i ended up sticking 4 rubber feet on the back of the thing to keep it from making suicide jumps off most surfaces. otherwise, its been a great little device!"
2,Upgrade was a downgrade,"I had a 548 and upgraded to the 568. Overall I liked the device but the issue with the screen filling with dust negates everything else. I had to replace it once but the new one is slowly accumulating a dust layer under the screen and that's with it kept in a zippered case whenever it's not in use. I would have replaced it again but it means reinstalling all software and ebooks and everything else I've added. I didn't even check the competition before buying this because I was so happy with my 548, I won't be replacing this one with an HP product. Very dissapointed."
4,Latest Pocket PC with Modereate Improvement to iPAQ,"Most of the improvements of the latest and the most expansive Pocekt PC is from the New Pocekt Windows 2002 rather than Jornada's its own technology. It has exact same Processor as iPAQ with expection of having more memory (everyone can throw in more memory these days, nothing so creative in that). The sound of Jornada is less than that of iPAQ. It sound little duller and dimer. Maybe it's my headphone. Also, its input display screen is duller too. You have to press your pen harder than you usualy have to with other Pocekt PCs. There is also minor bugs I've found with the new Pcoekt Windows 2002, although it's not Jornada's fault, it affects its perrformance neverthless.Jornada 568's place in the best Pocket PC will be qucikly given away to even better and faster ones in several months. You might want to wait little longer."
1,Waste of money !,"I bought a HP handheld PC last year for 250.00 from BestBuy.It's screen gradually lost it's function and even though I tried to use the reset botton or the "" align screen "" multiple times but it's not working at all.I called the company and because it's obvious that the hardware is weak and unreliable , they told me it's 13 month after you bought this device and your only option is to pay 145.00 dollars.This is to get another similar weak product. I think it's really hurting the customer when the touch-screen is not having the essential performance for a standard PDA and the authorities let this weak product be released to the stores.Thank You"
1,Too expensive & didn't work fine,"I experienced lots of trouble with this item, windows didn't work right, and when I found out how to manage my sychronization it was too late, I had lost all my data. I spent over 1,000 USD in the pocket PC and accesories and after 6 months finally trew it in the trash can, since the connection port had broken without doing nothing. It was my first Pocket PC after trying all Palm models and devices, and finally went back to Palm with Zire 71, which I recommend a lot better. Palm OS is more stable, never breaks dowm, and allways reliable."
2,"Great device, but dim screen gives it a thumbs down","I owned one for 29 of the 30 days in my return policy, and opted to return it. I loved the cover, the feel of it (very well balanced), the removeable battery, the buttons, etc., but the screen was way too dim, even with the backlight cranked up all the way. Compare it side by side with an iPaq and you'll see the difference."
5,"For now, the 568 is King","My new Jornada 568 is useful. The built-in software allows me to create Word and Excel documents, sync with Outlook for planning and task management, read e-books, surf sync'd web content using free Avant-Go connectivity on the web (very cool). It installed in minutes and hasn't failed to perform yet. The battery life is much better than I expected--mine goes days between recharges, since I frequently shut off the power and pocket it between uses. Quality construction--yes, I have dropped it a time (or two) and it seems durable. The reminders are cool too! There's one now, gotta go."
3,"Great hardware, frustrating OS","My HP Jornada is absolutely great hardware. The color display is very crisp. All my problems come from the Microsoft ActiveSync and Microsoft Outlook software. It took weeks to figure out why it would not synchronize with Outlook. The solution was very complicated, even for an experienced programmer, because the help troubleshooter did not contain the answer. Finally, the MS knowledge base gave me the very technical solution, which involved removing and reinstalling the USB device. When my pocket PC works right, it is great, and there is plenty of great software available. One warning: do not add third party software icons to the start menu manually. It takes extreme measures to remove them. Finally, a personal opinion, I prefer to avoid using Outlook, and this is a big disadvantage of the pocket PC OS for me."
5,Hey - this one works,"I have had my Jornada since it was a brand new model.Simply put, it does everything as promised. All software worksflawlessly. Screen, size, everything is as expected. No surprises - which is a surprise. If you want to do Spreadsheets, Word, or Outlook in a PDA, this is the way to go."
2,Interesting move...,"This classy little single packs two old-school covers (""My Generation"" and ""Doctor Doctor"" next to what was a newie in ""Lord of the Flies"". While ""Lord of the Flies"" is a rather pedestrian Maiden tune, the fun of ""My Generation"" carries this single to being ""worth it"" for the Maiden fanatic of any sort. It's mostly a curiosity item of course...but worth noting for the b-sides."
4,Another excellent compilation from Claude Challe,"The music is great, as usual. The ""latin-ized"" versions of many pop songs plus the beat added on to these new renditions make this CD a good buy. Almost as good as the Buddha Bar compilation."
2,"Written for a UK audience, not USA","If you are practicing in the USA, do not purchase this book. It wasn't obvious to me that this was written for a UK (and it's process adherents) audience. As it happens I have practiced architecture in the UK and this book might have helped to guide the process. But for someone looking for a guide of this type for a job within the USA, this book is not for you. First time I've sent a book back and Amazon was 5 stars with the return."
1,"defective, poorly manufactured machine","Our machine worked well for the first week, but after that began to demonstrate the same problems others described. And yes, we did read the instructions. The lid appears to be poorly designed so that overflow is inevitable on some machines. Also, the button you press to open the valve for pouring was broken from the start. A very expensive piece of junk."
1,Not Happy,I purchased this coffee maker 4 months ago based on the Delonghi name. My first complaint comes because of the problem with pouring the coffee. It always spills no matter where you position the top. My second and major complaint is that the element melted the area where the pot sits while brewing. Very disappointed in Delonghi!
1,DON'T give this to anyone you like for Christmas,"I went to Amazon after having several problems with this coffee maker only to find lots of others with the same problems. Yes, deLonghi makes a great product. No, this is not one of them. I have read the directions so often I have them memorized, and I can tell from the number of reviews that there is a serious quality control problem with this unit. I bought mine from Costco, and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs. I hope that is not the problem, but that is all I can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews. So...who else bought this unit from Costco? Because if that is the problem I'll bet Costco will be all over deLonghi to fix it. Until then, this is definitely not the coffee maker you will look forward to first thing in the morning, every day."
1,Minus One Star,"How I wish I had checked here for information prior to purchasing this useless item--it has all the problems listed, in spite of our careful reading of directions and following all instructions. Grounds in the coffee, lukewarm even as it just finishes brewing, leaks,yuk. Even preparing the carafe with hot water rinses prior to brewing does not prevent lukewarm coffee. Forget this one, folks--your money can be better spent. We are buying a new one today, even thought this item is only a month old. I get much too cranky to have lukewarm coffee with grounds and dregs near the bottom of my cup every morning."
2,Shop some more for a coffee maker,"I'll have to say I'm in that camp that calls this one junk. Had the same spill over issues as the others. Sure I can jiggle it and work with it until it doesn't spill over, but I should not have to do that. The aroma button doesn't work half the time. In fact, it shuts the unit off after making only a teaspoon of coffee regardless of how I try to use the feature. Additionally, when the pot if ""finished"" (the mfg says you can tell by the guggling sound) if you remove the carafe the dang thing leaks out the last of the water left in the filter holder onto the counter. Forget that stuff about the carafe keeping the coffee hot for hours. It simply does not. You can also count on having grounds in your cffee mor eoften than not. I'm really surprised at DeLonghi for the lack of quality in this coffee maker. They use to be a name one could rely on for a quality product. I'm taking this ""Mr. Junkie"" back and trading it in for a decent Mr.Coffee."
1,Superior pain in the rear,"Yeah, it makes decent coffee. But convenience and functionality, it falls flat.We use the timer function and about 1 out of every 3 mornings I wake up to the coffee pot 1/3 of the way full, yet the pot has been made. Why? Because the pot is extremely difficult to place correctly so that the coffee drips properly into the caraffe. If it is 1 millimeter off then the pot doesn't recognize the caraffe being there, turns off the drip and goes ahead and makes the coffee. What happens then? A big mess. The basket overflows with coffee, which luckily for the most part drips down the side and into the caraffe (along with grinds). The rest of the coffee stays in the basket until you readjust the caraffe... and by then the coffee is cold anyways, defeating the purpose of the caraffe.BTW, Consumer Reports ranks this pot #24 out of 25 pots for a reason. Just wish they would have rated it before I bought it."
2,Doesn't Keep Coffee Hot,"I've tired of the hastle each morning making perk coffee then transfering it into the thermal carafe that keeps it hot almost all day. I got the DeLonghi for Christmas but on the first morning used, the coffee was warm within just one hour. My husband and I often wake up at very different hours of the morning, this maker will just not work!"
4,Makes great coffee,"Very easy to use! Coffee tastes great! I have made coffee at 6 am - come home on my lunch break to hot coffee!The only draw back is if you don't have the filter in correctly it may over flow, but I just double cdheck this now and have had no problems with it since."
1,Never got it to work,"We replaced our 3rd Krups with this. My wife assembled it and when I awoke the coffee had not even started. I checked her work, and it seemed fine. After jiggling the pot and filter holder it started going, but would not release into the pot. I double-checked. After more jiggling, it started flowing.I noticed a small rubber nipple on the underbelly of the filter mechanism. I do not know what it does, but if it must be there, then I do not think that the machine will last more than a year. It is going back today.Who said that building a better mouse trap is so easy ?This is our second DeLonghi appliance that looks great, but doesn't work so good. But beauty is only skin deep (at least in the kitchen appliance world.)"
1,This is a horrible product!,"This doesn't even deserve one star! Liquid doesn't drain from the basket, so it overflows! DeLonghi wouldn't make good on it! I used it for a few days without a problem (other than lukewarm coffee) but then it totally went to heck in a hand basket. Please don't waste your money on this crummy product that the company won't stand behind!"
3,dissatisfied with billin,"The product is fine...it was a present. I was billed by Amazon and then again by DeLonghi. I'm still waiting for someone to send me a confirmation notice of pickup for the un ordered product. How can I order 1 coffee maker, receive 2, be charged for 2 and unable to return the one I didn't order? What kind of service is this? It will be a cold day in July before I order on-line. Why should I have to be inconvenienced by your error. It would be nice if you could resolve my dilema. I should be remimbursed for the unordered coffee maker, the delivery charge and the interest accrued on my credit card. Will someone please help me?"
2,A big disappointment,"While sleek in design, the product failed to live up to the one promise that made me want to buy it: the ability to keep hot or warm coffee which had already been brewed. Unlike conventional electric coffee makers which cost $20 or less, the DeLonghi had no facility to keep the coffee warm other than the insulating qualities of the cannister. After a short period of time, much of the heat in the brewed coffee was gone and there was no way to get it warm for drinking other than to pour the coffee into a saucepan and heat it on the stove or, alternatively, to pour it into a cup and heat it in a microwave oven. The less expensive conventional coffee makers have a hot plate which keeps the coffee hot as long as the switch is on."
2,Fire Hazard,"We've used this for the last year, and we've put up with it spilling over once in awhile when the grounds get stuck in the drip mechanism. We are patient people. But lately it has started turning itself on in the middle of the day (I'm not making this up, and no, the timer was not set.) I've come home and had the coffee maker burning hot to the touch, with no water inside. The first time I thought maybe someone had bumped it, or it was just a quirk, but when it happened a couple more times, I started to worry. I contacted the company, but so far there has been no response. I would not leave it plugged in unattended. We're looking for a new machine."
4,Almost Perfect,This is a sleek and sophisticated looking appliance that brews great coffee. The only drawbacks are that a filter is needed (in addition to the metal filter provided) as we experienced significant grind dumping into the carafe. The brew time is longer than on my previous pot (gevalia) and sometimes you have to push the carafe in further towards the end of brew time as it tends to stop before all the water drips through. Otherwise...i love it! Coffee stays warm for a few hours and always tastes great.
2,cheaply made,"we got this as a wedding gift and it worked ok for about 2 years, but there are 2 plastic parts that have broken in the last month making it unusable. would not recommend this machine or this brand to anyone"
1,Concur -- Slow/Bad Valve,"We've just about given up on this coffee pot--in fact, it's why I'm searching in the coffee pot section. Glad to see that many have had problems with the valve, to find grounds in the coffee, the basket full, the ensuing mess, etc. I'd look elsewhere."
5,Awesome.,"Great movie, and great condition. The plot somehow holds you with its sexual content throughout the film and it's bizarre style does not fail to deliver."
2,Not for me.,"Sorry, folks but I didn't like it and can't share the same enthusiasm as other commentators do. Wasn't even able to finish this 3 hour flick. Maybe I'm already too old for this kind of movies. The idea of photographing the young girls' panties using acrobatic movements doesn't talk to me much. Neither ""religious"" and underground ""cult"" aspects of the film were interesting for me. To my mind, the Japanese cinema greatness, like that of the Italian cinema, stayed in the 50's, 60's and 70's (Kurosawa, Shindo, Suzuki, Imamura, Kobayashi, Teshigahara, Ozu, Mizoguchi)."
5,Another Winner,"Nick Jans has done it again -- this time with pictures! Mr. Jans' previous compilations of essays (""The Last Light Breaking"" and ""A Place Beyond""), as well as his Alaska Magazine articles, introduced readers to his great love and appreciation of the Alaskan arctic and its inhabitants. In ""Tracks of the Unseen,"" Mr. Jans also includes his own photographs, which ideally complement his essays. There is some content overlap with his essays in ""Alaska"" (photographs by Art Wolfe), but this is a more integral pairing of the essays and photos. This is a lovely book, with Mr. Jans' graceful writing continuing to transport readers to the great north."
5,Great book for those who've been there and those who haven't,The book was thoroughly enjoyable. Photography was excellant. Chapters were short easy reads. I enjoyed the insights to life in the arctic and the discussion of the people who live there with snapshots of native culture.
2,Below Her Ability,"I found this CD very disappointing. Adagio is the only memorable song in my opinion. Lara definitely has a beautiful voice, but, as with so many singers right now she seems to think that ""belting"" is what is required on every song and tonal quality is often lost. Makes for a very bland bunch of songs. I'll take Celine any day. Lara co-wrote ""Broken Vow,"" which I think is an exceptional song, but I'd rather listen to Josh Groban's version. He knows how to put his heart into a song."
3,"Another ""Prozac"" Adult Centemporary Artist",I recently bought this cd on the reviews about what a great voice she has. If she has a great voice it is hardly heard through all the production. At times she sounds like she has just taken her daily dose of Prozac. At times the production is straight out of Celine Dion territory. I think we can do with one less Celine sound alike.
4,hidden surprise...,"I got this album a few days ago and haven't stopped listening to it since. Love by Grace is what got my attention so I decided to see what else the album offered. Aside from LBG, her hit single I Will Love Again is also featured. Some other great songs are Giving Up On You, Yeliel, and Broken Vow (what a powerful song and voice). I can understand why people compare her sound to Celine Dion(my favorite artist) because they are quite similar. I remember when I first heard I Will Love Again I thought it was a new single from Celine Dion. Lara has a very soothing voice that will relax you when you just want to unwind. Though heavy on the ballads, this album is a treat if you like the Celine sound. Lara has great potential and I hope to hear more from her in the future."
5,as good as it gets in this genre,"We use this cd as a test cd for speaker systems. Arrangement, production, mix and mastering are perfect fo the genre (orchestral pop). The vocals have been commented on - stunning. The material is mixed but song number 1 and 7 alone are worth buying this disk.The only question is : why wasn't there a follow up?"
5,Still Fantastic...after all these years,"I still have this CD in the car & iPod and listen to it weekly...timeless and excellent. When this was first released, I remember SONY offered money back (for a limited time) if you did not like the CD...no way!! I just wonder though, why Lara has not risen to greater stardom over the years."
3,"Good, but disapointing,","I have been familiar with Lara Fabian for most of my life. Lara has much talent, but her English album is disapointing. I would reccomend this to most people on the street just to get acquinted with her, but her French language albums are supier in quality and context to this one, maybe one day they will release an all French CD."
4,a mystery,"You never can tell who's going to be a hit with the public and who isn't. Lara Fabian has an incredible voice and isn't bad looking either. She's a star in Canada and Europe but most folks here don't even know her name. This album was supposed to be her introduction to America but it failed. Why? Who knows? The songs are a pleasant blend of power ballads and pop which was quite popular at the time. My only small nitpick is that Lara didn't sound like she was really comfortable singing in English. It sounds a little like she had no idea what the lyrics actually meant.So, is this album worth buying? Yeah sure if you love Celine Dion or Mariah Carey (before she got hooked on Hip Hop) and you want lush, romantic music. It's a mystery why Lara caught on here. I'm hoping the studio bosses will give another try."
3,"One good ballad, the rest is pallid","I saw Lara Fabian on TV and her performance of ""Adagio"" was riveting. I bought the album, and while it starts out promisingly enough with the same song, it quickly degenerates into a lot of forgettable, sappy stuff. After ""Adagio,"" a powerful, less-cliched-than-usual ballad (and a showcase for her considerable vocal skill), the rest of the CD disappoints. That said, there are 2-3 catchy songs toward the end, namely ""Yeliel (My Angel)"" and ""I Will Love Again."" A couple of these are being promoted in opposing radio formats, which might lead people to think this CD is a cohesive collection geared toward one or the other style, which it's not. Another distraction: on some of the tracks, her voice seems to get mixed back when she goes for some of the high notes, thus depriving us of the visceral thrill of her delivery. Her passionate performance on TV, which made me sit up and take notice, does not sound as good here."
3,Made in 2000,"Keep in mind this cd was released in 2000, so it has distinct ""sounds"" from that time period. Sounds very 90's in a way!Nonetheless, her voice does do 'gymnastics' like the overly mean critics review above, (geez, amazon!) but not in a bad way. I feel she is singing perfectly for her voice range, not trying to sound like she tries to hit notes she shouldn't attempt, instead hitting them perfectly and with emotion. Broken Vow and The Dream Within are my favorites. (Josh Groban does a nice version on Broken Vow as well.)Try going to the youtube website and looking up Broken Vow, and see just how powerful and gymnastic-ky her voice actually is.3 stars only because this cd does sound very 90s, if I were giving a review 8 years ago, it would have been 4."
2,Just another Celine Dion,"Well, for me, this album sounds just like Celine Dion's album. It's just dull, boring..."
2,"Great voice, bad music","It's a shame that one cannot enjoy the album more. She has a great voice and can incorporate different vocal dynamics without really being as irritating as other belters, but her choice of songs just doesn't have the necessary hooks for most people to want to listen to the album beyond 3 or 4 times. After that, one just puts the disc back in its case and shelves it somewhere, never to be played again.Lara, you should try again with better melodies. The world deserves to enjoy your great voice."
3,Could be better,"I bought this CD because I am a huge fan of Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand and I heard many people comparing Lara to them. While her vocal styles are similar to Celine, her songs just don't have enough to keep my attention. She is no way comparable to Barbra. I don't think she should be compared to anyone. She has her own style. She's a very powerful vocalist but her songs need work. This album reminds me of Celine Dion's earlier albums. Perhaps Lara will grow into a more suitable style for her voice. I don't see this album being a hit in America."
5,Outstanding Vocalist that Touched My Heart,"I stumbled across this album...then purchased...about a year ago and have been listening to it ever since. Lara Fabian's slightly throaty voice and equisite styling remind me of Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion. Like them, she puts a great deal of feeling into her vocals. Her songs are about the bitersweet memories of past relationships that she can't quite forget and still longs for. The orchestral accompaniments are very effective as well. I was completely captivated by this album."
2,You're in for a sad surprise,"I'll cut to the chase. this album dissapoints on so many levels. What on earth was she thinking releasing the spectacular song "" I Will Love Again"", which sticks out on this album like a diamond clad thumb, and then surrounding it with such dull and uninspired dreck. A guess she wanted to break into the U.S. market, which worked, but what happend to her since? GONE! Why? because she offered nothing to follow up this single with. I'm sorry but having an amazing voice, which she does, is just not enough these days.Do yourself a favor, buy the CD Single. My CD of this album now resides somewhere in the dump."
2,Another Whitney wanna be!,"UGH! Whitney Houston came along, she had an incredible voice and became a megastar all over the world. So what did record companies started doing? They started looking for Whitney clones. Then we had to deal with Mariah, then Celine and now Lara. For the love of God, leave Whitney alone! Jeez, it's becoming harrassement."
1,Oh my god !!!!!!,what is this ?!!!! I can't understand how people can buy it ! How dare you sell this you guys ?!!! This is quite ridiculous and she is total jerk ! It can't be considered as music...
4,Powerful and beautiful voice,"This young singer caught my attention when she did a number on the World Music Awards last year. I went to Amazon[.com] to buy this cd (Used)in hopes I would not be disappointed, and guess what -- I WASN'T! It is fantastic. Lara's voice is strong and forceful, she evokes feelings with her melodies and each track will treat you to a different facet of her talent. This is a keeper. I hope she is around for many years to come."
3,"Voice 5 stars, cd 2 stars","I absolutely love I WILL LOVE AGAIN and after hearing it in a few clubs I had to get the cd. Should've got the maxi single. If you like syrupy Celine Dione/Tina Arena type stuff you'll love this cd. Don't get me wrong she has a beautiful voice, but the material is very lacking, I WILL LOVE AGAIN excluded."
5,"Wonderful cd, the best I have bought!","After hearing the wonderful ""I will love again"" I rushed out and bought this cd. I am so glad that I did! I would not lie to anyone......this cd is the best one i have. Every single song on her cd is awesome, how many cds can you really say that about? Her cd is filled with 3 upbeat songs, many slower songs that give you goose bumps because her voice is so beauiful and a few ones that show off her powerful voice. I would recomend this cd to people who enjoy good music, beauiful voices and well written lyrics. She also writes many of the songs on the cd which I think is pretty cool. So go and get this cd! You will love it!"
3,"Don't Buy Just for the single "" I Will Love Again""","If you were expecting a very upbeat, dance album like I was due to the success of ""I Will Love Again"", you will be very disappointed. ""Love Again"" is the only upbeat/dance track, better off buying the CD Single, trust me. But if you are into really good ballads. The album is fantastic. She is a cross between Celine Dion, Lara's voice is better, but with the edge of another Canadian, Alannah Myles."
5,An earthly voice that soars in the Heavens,"If you're all about the voice that still sounds human but has the emotions, power, stamina and above all beauty than you'll love her albums. Lar Fabian's voice a gift from God. And her determination, discipline and devotion is her gift back to Him."
5,A Rare Vocal Gift,"After viewing Lara Fabian's performance on public television, I had to purchase the CD. I was a bit surprised reading Courtney Kemp's review, as Lara Fabian is anything but bland in her vocal styling and delivery. As for stating the CD would be a good gift for a 13-year old, I doubt many 13 year-olds would appreciate perfect-pitch, lush orchestrations, 4-5 octave range, and lyrics sung in Italian - especially when most in that age-range are accustomed to the pre-teen pop of today. Lara ranks up there with Streisand in the sheer power, range, and emotion of her voice. ""Adagio"" sung in Italian is anything but a ""softie"" - it's a passionate piece that boils over in pure emotion in the closing bars. Lara moves easily from pop, to soft rock, to jazz, to near-operatic. Anything but bland! Buy it and play it again and again."
2,Nice try but ...No Cigar,"Well where do I start. Celine imitation comes to mind. Celine wanna-be. Celine rip-off. Shall I go on. The thing is I really thought she had one original bone in her. Turns out she tries too hard to copy other artists and it shows. Embarassingly shows. She steals from Celine like crazy, even the gestures, breathing, and emotives. But she can't pull it off. Her voice is not as refined or powerful and huge like Celine's. She'll always be second rate and pales in the shadow of Celine but I guess that's as far as she will go. Let's be clear here. She's has nothing that could catapult her into the world of super stars. She's not original or talented enough. But everyone I guess has their 15 minutes of fame."
2,Celine Dion Wannabe!,"When I first bought this album, I thought I was gettimg the next Cher or Madonna. I mean the track ""I Will Love Again"", is really hot right now. It has that ""Believe"", ""Frozen"" feel to it. So I honestly thought the whole cd had that type of style. To my disappointment, Lara Fabian is just a carbon copy of Celine Dion. Nothing unique, nothing original. Buy the single you'll get some really awsome mixes. But don't waste your time or money, unless you like that mushy kinda stuff."
3,"Not ""too"" Tumeric!","I love the flavor of Tumeric Extract and use a dropper full in my cup of morning tea. I usually purchase another brand, a bit more expensive than this product, however in my effort to economize, I decided to give this brand a ""go"". While I cannot really speak ""ill"" of this brand of Tumeric Extract, I will say that it lacks the potency and vigor of my previous brand. I will not reorder this product."
1,lava alarm! video,"my son got lava alarm for his birthday he has just recently gotten into the rescue heros we all like them but in this movie two boys are being recued from a valcano.in the part were the boys are being lifted out just in time when you see the boys from the heros view it looks like both boys have a rope around thier neck. well my son wrapped a cord around his neck ""pretending"" to be a hero the cord caught and luckily it came lose because he fell off his bed.he now has a three inch rope burn on his neck it scared him but i think that people with children who have active imaginations and like the heros should be told that they can get hurt if they do it like they do in the video...all ropes cords or anything else is gone from his room but it does not change the fact that on christmas eve we almost lost our son he was lucky i belive the people who made the video over looked a very important part of the movie..........."
4,"Great product, great customer service!!!!!",I use this tool a lot. I had one break and their customer serve was perfect. I decided to buy a back up.
5,Replace them bits!,I cut alot of pocket screws and I've bought other bits. But these are some seriously sharp bits. I was amazed at how much easier it is to cut a pocket screw hole with a sharp bit. So go ahead. Replace the bits - it's worth it.
1,hard,I ordered the cookies on a monday ended up getting the cookies about 9 days later they where hard dry very disappointed.
3,"Etheral photos of ice, snow, the sky and water","If you're looking for a photography book with 'beautiful, Kodak moment' pictures of wildlife, the Inuit, wild flowers upon the tundra, etc., this is NOT for you. But, if you like ""nature"" photography at its minimalist best, these photographs are glorious, providing, like me, you enjoy looking at photos of fog upon the water and the patterns that ice floes make upon the land and sea.I was a tad disappointed in the text... because it's ""poetry"", as opposed to the photographer detailing his journey. An account of Ketchum's journey is in another part of the book, but it would have been far more effective, if his observations were next to the images, instead of a poet's musings on the area, which left me unsatisfied and with questions about certain images (like where they were, etc.). This is a remote area that we know little about and the photographer's account and observations next to his photographs would have been most helpful and informative."
3,Textures,"Luxurious Textures in WatercolorThe book is well done, but leans mostly toward lace tablecloths and still life. I would have liked to see textures like metal, crockery, more animals with different types of fur, etc."
3,disappointed,"I am a general contractor and tradesman who has used DeWalt tools for many years. I have always been satisfied with them and when I have had a problem I have always received excellent support at the local DeWalt service center. The compressor unit I just received had the manual, oil and dipstick in a separate package in the box with the compressor. For some reason they sent the wrong dipstick that did not fit my unit. Besides not fitting tightly in the unit, the measuring portion of the dipstick did not read the oil level properly. I was able to get it replaced at no charge at my local service center but if I had depended on the wrong dipstick to gage the oil in the unit I would have burned up the compressor and as it says in the manual, you are not covered if you run your units low on oil."
1,It didn't work,It didn't work. Right out if the box the motor was seized. I never got a chance to test it. oh well.
4,"Good product, though few sheets","I purchased this product for use in my office because it was half the price of similar products at local retail office stores. I am happy with it, though the number of pages seems to be fewer than I was expecting. Overall it's a very good product--the sheets have strong adhesive that remains where placed even when moved to new locations. Marker does not bleed through either. I would purchase again...too bad they're just expensive in general!"
3,No easel included,"I have bought these ""giant sticky notes"" previously and they came on a cardboard backing that turned into an easel. You could stand it on a table top and write on it. These did not have that."
2,R2 Biscuits,Biscuits were wrong size. No where in the ads did it mention the measurement in inches. R2 is too small and I don't know what is one twice that size for the DBJ50 Ryobi cutter????
4,An excellent historical biography,"What I enjoyed most about this book was that it tied together historical figures I had read about elsewhere -- the earls of Leicester and Essex, Bess of Hardwick, James I, Elizabeth I -- in a completely different context and from a widely different perspective. Sarah Gristwood did an excellent job placing Arbella and her struggles within the larger political stories of her day. Her writing, although mostly accessible, does have its moments of insiderism -- such as when she refers to Penelope Rich as Sidney's Stella, for seemingly no reason and without further elaboration. I think you're better off reading this book if you already have a working knowledge of the court of Elizabeth I."
4,"Sure, why not","This is a fine biography. I have read quite alot about this period in english history for a 30 y/o college drop out, but I did feel that this book dragged on just a bit. I agree with one of the other reviewers in saying that it would surely help if this is not your first book about english history, the names and such can be difficult to remember for a first timer. I had run across Arbella many times in other books I read, so I was interested to know more about her. This book helped me achieve that. I just don't know if she is interesting enough to merit such a big book, and I felt like the author was strained to fill so many pages about Arbella. So she was next in line for the throne, it doesn't mean she was interesting. Want the book? Get it, why not, but I would be surprised if it was your favorite read of the year."
4,"""In Ireland"" almost = ""Over The Sea to Skye""","Note that the album ""In Ireland"" is the same as the album ""Over The Sea to Skye"", except that ""Over The Sea to Skye"" contains an additional 16th track."
3,"Fun, punky & different","I, for one, am glad CC stuck to his guns and did this album. I love the punk-pop stuff, and he's great at it. It's a fun, but too short, trip through the wacky mind of CC. I would've expected better production from Jack Blades, but the sound quality actually fits for the style of music. ""Slave Laura"" and ""Framed"" are my initial favorites. This cd won't change the world, but it is a nice breath of fresh air."
4,Good CD,"I went to High School with CC,when he was Bruce Johansen, he was a year ahead. I remember his first band and the talent shows and when he left for L.A. He has really matured intop a great rock star.This cd is excellent rock and roll. and in my opinion much better than Poison"
3,Not at all what I was expecting,"Being a huge Poison fan, I picked this disc up used for a couple of bucks figuring it was worth a shot. I was incredibly surprised at the unpoison like music. It is much more along the lines of Blink 182 or Greenday punk influenced music. While it is not bad, it's not the hard rocking album I was expecting. It was worth the two bucks I paid for it, and is an interesting listening experience when the right mood strikes, but give me C.C. with Poison anyday."
2,Fair,Hope CC goes back with Poison. This 11 song CD is less than 30 minutes long which tells me Bret wrote all the lyrics for Poison. Vocals are fair (CC sings) and guitar is slower than Poison.
2,Punchy and short just like C.C.,"This disc is only 29 1/2 minutes long. The opening track (Framed) is excellent but after that its downhill with the exception of maybe Anything Can Happen and Bonnie Bradley. C.C. wrote every lyric and all the music without exception. This is the problem. If Jack Blades (producer) would have been allowed to co-write these songs with C.C., then this could have been a much stronger disc. This is clearly the result of an ego driven guitarist who has seized the opportunity to be self indulgent in a way that artists with real talent never even dream of. This disc is obviously a gift from John Kalodner to C.C. in the hopes of keeping Poison going."
4,Solid...,This is a very good and very solid disc. I find it style wise in the traditional modern American mode of rockabilly and would place it as being between the more hillbilly sounds of things like Dave and Deke and the more straight ahead rockabilly of other modern bands. They have found a very good rocking balance with this disc.
4,Note differences between washer and pan head,"I bought the Kreg pocket hole kit and love it. It comes with a few dozen 1 1/4 screws, and I bought these thinking they are the same. These are the Pan Head, which are nice, but the ones in the kit are washer heads that have more purchase on the bottom of the pocket. The pan heads will sink into the wood, even using walnut and cherry. I have not had one fail yet, but I worry that they sink about 3/16"" deeper into the joint than the other screws. Visit the Kreg site to find the whole assortment of screws and plugs."
3,Used to be great,"I loved this book as a teenager in the 70s. I still think it should have been turned into a movie back then. I recently reread it (in 2006) and I was dissapointed. It hasn't aged well. Part of it is the science fiction, which seems especially dated, but mostly it's that the story and character development seemed ham fisted.What bugged me the most was how poor a detective Lije Bailey was. It wasn't his powers of deduction as much as his deus ex machina behavior that dragged the plot out.(I think I need to stop rereading Asimov before I become gravely dissapointed with all my memories.)"
5,One Of The Best Asimov's I've Read,"The positronic brain is the new disruption of the earth. People have lost their jobs, and now, Elijah Baley is paired up with R. Daneel Olivaw. (R. for robot.) It is a book of where Elijah does not trust his partner, but little does he no that Daneel will turn out to be his best friend...If you read this one, ya gotta read them all!They pull you in and you digest it as well as Daneel digests food!(You have to read the book to find out what that means!)I'ts One Of The Best Asimov's I've Read!I loved it, and hopefully you will too!"
1,cardboard 1D,"Too shallow, stiff and hokey. No action. No emotion. A great plea for ZERO POPULATION GROWTH! tho."
5,Possibly his most readable fiction,"This book and Asimov's The Naked Sun, where Elijah Baley appears again, form a delightful pair of what is probably Asimov's best, and certainly most readable, fiction. Less epic and visionary but more approachable than his Foundation novels, the book also introduces one of Asimov's most memorable characters, the android detective, R. Daneel Olivaw.Together, Baley and Olivah make a great detective team in this futuristic murder mystery novel, which also contains some of Asimov's first speculation on the social implications of robots and androids, and he also discusses the Three Laws of Robotics for which he became famous."
3,SO SO,A murder in the future and robots make life easier or do they? Man is confused and robots are there to help. Kind of boring for me. Isaac has better reads.
5,Simply Awesome Asimov,"After reading the Foundation series, I found that I was missing something: something about a story of a robot and earth. This novel, though short, is a mystery about a murder, but with ideas throughout and such potential for future writings I'm ready to read the next one.If you enjoy Sci-Fi: read it. Suggested that you read I, Robot first, but definitely not required."
5,One of the greatest,"This is one of the best science fiction novels because all of the elements re-inforce each other. They mystery is interesting in itself but also gives a pretext for describing a vast future metropolis, from the ""yeast farms"" to the transportation system. The characters have been molded by their environment: they have a phobia for going outside the crowded city, and they have developed intricate social customs to avoid tripping over each other all the time. Asimov also comes up with a plausible reason as to why a single murder could have interstellar repercussions. Best of all, he avoided making his hero the macho type that runs around with blasters blazing: Baley has his quirks, but he THINKS his way to the solution."
5,my first asimov and I want some more!,"this book was well-rounded good entertainment with a lil' science on the side which is always nice. It combines mystery, imagination, and intelligence into a real good book. It takes place thousands of years from now and creates a pretty interesting, but sad, world. good stuff."
5,Asimov and Robots - Does it get any better?,Anyone with the remotest interest in SciFi should read all of Asimov's books. I read them decades ago. They only become better with time.
5,Excellent - Why aren't there more ST books like these?,"As I said above, it's excellent, and it's view of what Star Fleet in the 23rd century is like is better in some ways than the that shown in other, more ""official"" books. I wish that Guenther and Caol Riel would make many more volumes! There's plenty of starship classes left to detail!"
1,An execrable book: how not to write historical fiction,"I only finished this book because each page was a new revelation in how *not* to write a book. Turgid, redundant prose; cardboard characters; plodding plot -- Caldwell has them all. Most risible is the way she interlards her wooly-headed pseudo-philosophizing throughout. Wait, no; most risible is the way she feels it necessary to cast her hero as some sort of proto-Christian devoutly inquiring after the prophesies of the Jews and awaiting the coming messiah. Even the history of the period is perverted, glossed-over, and twisted to suit her desire for eschatological analogy. There is absolutely nothing of value in this book."
5,They Don't Write Books Like This Anymore,Excellent book based on the author's original translations from the Latin. Brings the life of Cicero and his contemporaries to life.
2,Too Talky,"Encountering Taylor Caldwell after a layoff of 35 years instilled a new axiom in me: never reread the favorite authors of one's youth. They read better in memory than in mature analysis.Taylor Caldwell brings craftsmanship and writing skill to ""A Pillar of Iron,"" but beyond that, her novel is talky and historically inaccurate. Focusing on a heroic Cicero who never really existed, ""A Pillar of Iron"" seems mostly a showcase for its author's mid-twentieth century political concerns. I'd love to see Cicero's reputation revived but don't think Caldwell has really succeeded in doing that here."
4,Enjoyable,I enjoy this item only the corners of the star are somewhat pokey and also kind of grab on clothes. I would only recommend it on piercings that are super new and sensitive.
4,4.75 is more like it,"This movie was such a pleasent surprise to me. For some reason I had never heard of this movie. I rented it being a fan of the serial killer genre. Jolie and Hawke do a wonderful acting job in this movie. Hawke to me has always been a very underated actor and with the exception of Girl Interupted and Gia I have not been that impressed with Jolie, But she is excellent in this movie.This movie is about a killer who takes on the identity of his victims. There are some very gruesome killings in this movie. Another thing I like is the profiler work done by Jolie. I always compare actors doing profile work to Edward Norton in Red Dragon because he is was untouchable as the best to me. She lives up to my standard set by Norton in this movie. Who the killer is in this movie is fairly obvious, but there is a little twist in the end that was pretty good.I recommend buying this movie because is very entertaining and everyone I have let borrow it has agreed with me."
4,Great Thriller.......,"I missed seeing Taking Lives when it was playing in theaters so when it was released on DVD and video, I bought it right away. This is a great thriller movie. The beautiful Angelina Jolie plays FBI agent Scott, a FBI profiler and gives a great performance. Also appearing in the film are Ethan Hawke and Kiefer Sutherland. I was glad that Sutherland didn't have a major role in this film, for I'm not a fan of his. Scott is put on this case to profile and try to find a serial killer who has for years killed people, taking their identities. This is a movie that keeps you guessing until the end. Although not a horror film, there is alot of suspense and strong violence. Full of twists and having a great surprise ending, Taking Lives is a must see for thriller fans who have not yet seen this movie. I don't think you will be disappointed. A movie worth watching and owning!!"
3,Okay entry into the serial killer genre,"Taking Lives isn't bad; it's okay. By okay, I do not mean great, I mean that it's not a total waste of time. It has its moments and a couple of decent twists along the way, but it is certainly not a real nailbiter or murder classic. Jolie is as fine as she can be here - but the role does not allow her to do too much. Hawke is clearly having issues - he's all over the place. Gena Rowlands - why? Martinez- why? I think everybody must have expected the end product to be a lot better than it is - otherwise, I cannot explain the cast. Directors cut has an extended, silly an unneccesary sex scene. Save this one for a boring rainy day."
3,Taking Lives,Taking Lives really hard to watch. Angelina Jolie did a fair job. The ending was a good surprise. Enjoyed that part.
2,Taking Lives - Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition),Didn't care for this movie or Angelina Jolie's performance. Did like Ethan Hawk's acting along with Olivier Martinez. Movie was gory and didn't like the story.
2,"Herring, anyone?","This ridiculous attempt at something devious and twisted ends up only tortuous and unnecessarily confusing. A review quoted on the box says, ""It will keep you guessing until the very end, and even then you'll be wrong!"" Inundated by red herrings, I stopped guessing about halfway through and just waited for the revelation scene which, when it comes, will surprise no one who's ever seen a suspense film, despite the movie's attempts at misdirection. The ending is unbelievably silly (by which I mean both silly and unbelievable). Also unbelievable is that someone who looks like Angelina Jolie would fall for someone who looks like Ethan Hawke. Their love scene is embarrassing...and noisy. Two stars because one is as low as you can go; I save one star for something like an Ed Wood film."
2,No Justice Done,"I went to great lengths to get a copy of this as i was not interested in watching it on the big screen.I have seen comparisons being made between this and 'Lambs' but really this comes as a cheap imitation of the genre. It has been touted as a remake of a novel but really what were the writers thinking.It boasts of a great cast but what were the actors thinking? Ethan Hawke tries his best to save his half baked role. I was most interested in watching the movie as we do not exactly get to see him in too many movies.Angelina is today's Sharon Stone, she probably is a bit more wilder than Stone. Angelina does seem to be having a star hangover and needs to put more into her performances which these days seem to be neither here nor there. She however seems to be performing the steamy scenes with gusto, would like to see the same in some of her other performances.All in all a good waste of talent and time."
3,A predictable but watchable thriller,"Taking Lives starts out as a promising Silence of the Lambs type of movie but after awhile it's not hard to figure out who the killer is. Still though Angelina Jolie works well in cop roles. She was good in the Bone Collector and she's good here too. Ethan Hawke is good too but he has been better in films such as Training Day for example. Keifer Sutherland is a really good actor but here he has nothing to do but show his face like 2 or 3 times. The idea is good but the script doesn't do much with it, in fact the movie gets some-what silly by the end. It's nice seeing some skin from the beautiful Jolie but the sex scene doesn't really even fit in with the tone of the movie. So why am I giving it *** ? because the movie makes for a good rental at least."
1,Piece of trash,"As hard as it is to get an original movie idea looked at, there is always someone ready to drop a million on a piece of crap.This movie offers nothing new in any way.Saw the flick in the theaters and almost walked out.The sex scene was not needed and felt unrealistic to the characters. The ending was total garbage leaving you with a ""what, thats it?"" It's almost as if the writers gave up and didn't write an ending so the director picked up the camera and invented a total waste of time-rushed ending.You could put gallons of blood and thousands 'ol big lips boobie shots and it would still be worth a dvd rental at your local gas station on a weekday as you sit in the hospital with broken legs and unable to move...anywhere.B."
4,"Not spectacular, but worthy","Aside from the ending, which I thought was misplaced and hurried, the movie was enticing, surprising (at least to me) and fun to watch. I liked this much more than Secret Window and recommend this as a great late night thriller to watch."
3,Days of Our Lives,"Taking Lives has 3 things going for it:1. Angelina Jolie--Angelina has a presence and sensuality that can't be denied even as you realize her only really GREAT role was in Gia.2. Oliver Martinez--he's very nice to look at.3. It's better than Ashley Judd's Twisted.--Not saying much I know, but you have cling to whatever you've got.I assume everyone who likes this particular genre has seen Silence of the Lambs and 7even, so I recommend a movie that flew beneath the radar--Identity--with John Cusack and Ray Liotta. While Taking Lives is the down syndromed child of 7even and ...Lambs, Identity is their respectable, very competent first cousin."
2,Predicatable,"I am a big fan of Jolie's but I say pass on this one. The movie is very predictable from start to near finish. I was hoping for some twists and thought the predictablity was a ruse...it wasn't. Angelina's character is shallow, not the strong character we're accustom to for her. And there is no spark between her and Ethan Hawke making their relationship unbeleivable. I suggest waiting and renting this movie."
2,Maybe the directors cut made more sense.,"We watched the fullscreen version of this flick and I found it tedious and unbelievable (for the genre, anyway). The first few minutes were very creepy, but once the story went to Montreal, that atmosphere vanished. I thought the Angelina Jolie character lacked any spark and Ethan Hawke wasn't much better. The ending made even less sense than the rest of the film, but I could have dozed through a scene or two and missed something. Like I said in the title, perhaps the directors cut was a better film. I doubt it though."
2,Taking (2 Hours Out of Our) Lives,"Wow, Angelina Jolie is gorgeous. Other than that, there's not much to recomend this film. I don't understand why these writers, directors, and actors want to make thrillers, when they really (apparently) don't know anything about how they work.The plot turns & twists in ""Taking Lives"" are interesting at first, but soon tax the viewer's patience. The whole segment with Kiefer Sutherland is ludicrous when one takes even a split second to think about it. As is the jaw-dropping ending sequence.To add insult to injury, there's a ""Gag Reel"" included among the DVD extras. What is this, ""Smokey and the Bandit?"""
4,A good thriller,"While not on the level of ""The Silence Of The Lambs"",""TakingLives"" is still a good cat-and -mouse film noir thriller onits own terms.Sharply directed by D.J. Caruso and well-writtenby Jon Bokenkamp from Michael Pye's popular book,backed by asolid production and brilliant editing by Anne V.Coates,thefilm moves along briskly and works up a good head of suspense.The performances are excellent,with Angelina Jolie and EthanHawke especially outstanding.It's nice to see Hawke playing a real creep for once.The movie has enough twists and turns to keep you interested thoroughout.Not as good as ""Mystic River"",but worth watching."
2,"""Taking Lives"" nothing new.","""Taking Lives"" is an ok movie. It provides some twists and turns but is mostly predictable. Some surprises are ok but not enough to carry this movie. Proceed with caution when seeing this one. I recommend seeing ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Seven"" instead."
3,GreatMovie,"I love Watched this movies..Now im waiting my order bluray from amazon the whole shrek,Die hard collection,Rocky: The Undisputed Collection [Blu-ray] :)"
5,WOWED.,"And I'm fourteen, but that's beside the point.Okies. A friend from our high school's CC team invited me and the other gals over for a movie night after a tough meet to kinda relax and stuff. We watched a little Family Guy and then turned to the next movie.Which was : dun-da-da-DUUUUN... Taking Lives, unrated director's cut on DVD. WOW. I was completely won over. I got sucked into teh TV to the point where I'd shout out ""NO!"" and stuff like that at crucial moments and the girls would turn around and go ""SHHHH!"" Normally I don't get sucked in, but that's the mark of a wonderful movie.But you may not want to see this version if you have a weak stomach because, thanks to Martin, there's...a lot of gore. And then a buncha sex in this version, but we fast-forwarded thru that.All the twists and turns were beautifully unplanned and just... WOW. If you haven't seen it, you are so missing out.GO BUY THIS MOVIE NOW. Unless of course, you don't like gore or sex, then maybe get the regular version."
3,Predictable with a twist,"Angelina Jolie plays Illeana, an FBI Special Agent who specialty is profiling. She is lent to a law enforcement agency in Canada that is on the trail of a serial killer. I was able to discern the killer almost right away. Which is why it is not 4 stars.The killing spree this person goes on covers a twenty-year period. Where he kills people in order to take over their identity. And when he feels it is time to move on, he needs a new identity...therefore another murder. Considering the way they portray him, you would think he would kill more often then he does.The ending, though not believable, is the only twist in the movie that took me by surprise. The movie, though easy to watch, is really only for big fans of Jolie. I would recommend renting this movie before you buy."
3,Subpar movie,"I was expecting more from this movie. Seeing the trailers, it looked like a great thriller. It should have been so much more. The performances are good, but not enough to save a mediocre script. Perhaps if there was more excitement along the way, or a plot that was easier to follow, it would have been more rewarding to watch. The problem is there isn't enough suspense, they spend too much time on a plot that moves slowly. I found all the ""twists"" to be very predictable, I called them all before they were exposed. So no real surprise. It's an ok movie I just expected more."
2,Not Good,Taking Lives is one of those films that turn out to be a big dissapointments. There has been to many movies that have had the same premise. This thriller is not that thrilling. The acting is not all that great. Some things in the film also make no sense. Angelina Jolie has no chemistry at all with her co star Ethan Hawke. If you are looking for a thrill this is not the movie to watch. And if you still want to see it I suggest you rent it instead of wasting your $20.00 on a bad movie like this.
3,"Predictable at Best, but fine cast","Ok, so I love nothing better than a suspense (who did it) movie and ""Taking Lives"" is smack dab in that genre. The casting was good and has a very attractive actors with Angelina, Ethan, Martinez and a ""cameo"" by Kiefer Sutherland (if you are a big fan of Kiefer save your money - it is really just a cameo) I thought that it has a very strong plot and could have really been a sit on the edge of your seat, nail biting movie, but it falls way short of satisfying. The key to a good suspense is the not knowing. In this particular movie, unless you are a pus head, you know immediately who the killer is. So that blows a hole in the rest of the plot. All I can say is the ending offers a great twist but until then you feel like taking your own life. 2 *."
1,Wow-the worst movie I've seen all year,"Yikes-this movie is just so so bad. Can I start off with the fact that they claim they're in Montreal but then the camera pans the most famous building in Quebec City? The movie is trite and cliche, with never an original thought or twist. My husband and I came up with much better twists that we thought would be coming but oh no. The screenwriter had to go with what has been done over and over and over again. Boring, bland, bad acting and predictable. See it only if you're interested in Angelina Jolie getting naked. Again."
2,Goofiest flick of the year,"I watched this DVD with friends and afterward said ""I didn't realy understand the supernatural angle."" I was surprised when they said it wasn't supernatural thriller, so we went through the DVD and picked out many instances where rules of time and space get bent to benefit the plot. There's a hardly a scene where the alert viewer won't say ""Hey wait a minute!"" Mystery fans expect better writing than that. Also notice the chase scene where the bad guy's gun changes from an automatic to a revolver and back again. I still can't even swallow the basic premise - a serial killer who does not just do ""identity theft"" but literally moves into his victims apartments, lives their lives (and even pays their bills) for years as if nobody would notice."
2,Bland and predictable,"You can probably guess who the villain is before you even start watching this movie. Yes, it's that predictable. And so is the car chase scene and the sex part. I don't know what the ""director's cut"" entails, but the movie is bland and lame. Nothing thrilling or sexy at all (no, I'm not a desensitized viewer). Acting is Hollywood at its most boring, and the storyline just never engages. Mildly entertaining on a stormy Saturday night when you got nothing better to do -- I watched this over a tasteless after-work dinner -- but otherwise worth skipping."
1,The Worst So Called Scary Movie Since Texas Chainsaw Mass.,"Too predicatable, not scary in the least, completely unoriginal, not one good performance, the first scene was okay but the rest of the movie was an absolute waste of time. 1 out of a 10."
2,Why Angelina Why?,"Boring and flat. The acting lacks enthusiasm and the script lacks credibility. I generally love Angelina Jolie, but she was apparently as unimpressed with this movie as I was. Ethan Hawke was uncharacteristically boring. The script is beyond lifeless, and to all the critics who compared this piece of celluloid crap to The Silence of the Lambs, maybe you ought to rent Silence of the Lambs and see how wrong you are. What a waste of 2 hours."
4,Good movie,Great plot and good acting and A nice suspence. Faily good for a young Angelina Jolie. The image is typical of the time period of the movie.
4,Edge Of Seat,"This movie was NOT RATED so I thought it was safe for me and my family. If you like AJ nude, you may like this movie. Except for the fact that it was really rated R, it was really a good movie. I watched it once, couldn't do it again. That's my preference. Dave"
2,Not believable,"The previews for this looked much better so I was disappointed a bit. The story is about a serial killer who spends time living the lives of his victims. The story takes place in Canada and Angelia Jolie plays the part of a FBI agent assigned to help catch the killer. If you are a Keifer Sutherland fan, you'll be very disappointed b/c he does not have a big part in this at all and they could have played up his role better than they did. If you are a man who likes Angelia Jolie, then you will undoubtedly like the rather lengthy sex scene than is towards the end of the movie - she shows a lot of skin. The movie plot was pretty slow and not very suspenseful. I would not bother watching this unless it happened to be showing on cable and I had nothing else better to do. Not worth renting unless it's free."
3,Review,I just don't understand why Angelina Jolie at her acting level today feels it necessary to due nudity. That aside it was a fair thriller with some good twists. I feel she and the movie itself could have been so much better.
2,Semi-thrilling Thriller,"This film is so stupid that when different locations in Quebec are shown the captions read ""St. Jovite, Canada"" or Montreal, Canada"" like mentioning Quebec would be too complicated for the retarded masses this film is intended for. Angelina Jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately. But I will say that I am happy that she went to see an Expos game while in Montreal... and that she shows us some skin here. The kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is SO ANNOYING!!! Someone needs to steal his John Lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film. One bonus in here is that Marie-Jose Croze is in it albeit briefly. She should have been the lead. She's hotter than Angelina and a better actress (see Munich). This film is also beneath Jean-Hugues Anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun Ethan Hawke any day of the week."
1,Rated R for retarted,"Wants to be se7en, but can't hold a candle to it. A really, really stupid movie."
4,great movie,this movie was a lot better than i thought it would be it had a very good ending i dont know why it only stayed in tht theater for a week.i would sugest you rent this movie
3,"Entertaining, But Too Easy To Solve","This was a so-so serial killer movie with good and bad marks.The good marks were mainly for keeping the viewer's interest. You don't fall asleep watching this film! Angeline Jolie looks as good as I've ever seen her, facially and figure-wise.The film loses marks for an easy-to-solve story, some credibility gaps especially later in the movie and too small a part for Keifer Sutherland to get third billing. Also, the French accents by Jean-Hgues Anglade and Tcheky Karyo were hard for me to understand, forcing me to put on the English subtitles.Overall, thuogh, it's worth a rental and was better than I had heard it was."
3,ok but not great,This is a so so movie some good things and many other bad things. Angelina Jolie played here role well but the rest of the cast is below average. a solid sex scene but in general it's just poorly produced.
3,So-so serial killer thriller,"""Taking Lives"" had a lot of potential. You've got an interesting story. FBI Profiler, Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) is a stranger in a strange land, Montreal Canada. She's been sent there to help track down a serial killer who assumes the lives of the people he's killed and thus becomes pretty untraceable. In the process, she falls for the only witness Art Dealer Costa (Ethan Hawke) who was the only witness to the first crime.The film offers some serious action and interesting twists, but nothing you wouldn't see on television save for a pretty steamy scene between Scott and Costa which earns the film its R-rating.The problem is, the film's slow and not quite believable on several levels. It is great if you are a serious fan of either Hawke or Jolie.Rebecca Kyle, October 2008"
3,"Predictable, Angelina Jolie has good performance!","The story is about a killer that consumes his victims identity for the thrill of living his victim's lives. This movie is predictable. Do not listen to the review of Greg Russel of WDWB-TV, because it is very predictable. I new who the killer was within the first 20 minutes of the movie. I kept thinking to myself that there was some kind of twist, but there never really was anything significant enough to make it entertaining. This is better (exception of 'Frailty' a great thriller flick) than several of the thrillers I've seen of late, but has the same formula I've seen in several movies. Angelina Jolie is great as usual and Ethan Hawke as well, but this movie is far from anything memorable. DVD Extras include documentaries, theatrical trailer and gag reals with english, and Quebec dubs, and english, french and spanish subtitles."
1,dumb,"Most of the other reviews are exactly right. The quotes on the casefor the video promise that you'll never guess what will happen next.False! Most of the plot is very predictable and obvious. Sutherlandis barely in the movie at all in spite of his star billing. Jolie's characteris weird and oddly motivated. Ethan Hawkes acting is awful. On topof that, please explain to me why an American FBI agent is helpingout on a CANADIAN case anyway? Plus the sound volume does roller-coasterup and down. Bad movie. I'm sorry I rented this."
3,"If nothing else, she's lovely.","Taking lives? Yeah, wasting a few precious of my already too short life. Ok, it's not that bad! First of all, the performances for each of the major characters are quite impressive--especially, Hawke and Jolie. And while I wasn't on the edge of my seat with wide eyes, the director builds just enough suspense to make you the tiniest bit jumpy(I actually jerked and almost screeched on two occasions). You'll find two plot twists within this film: one which is quite obvious after the first 15 minutes and one which becomes obvious but only seconds before it is actually revealed. Overall it's a good suspense film which I would voluntarily watch again. Check out the car that Jolie drives in the movie; very unconvincing as the vehicle of a female FBI agent--surely they could have done a little better :)"
3,Thriller...,"Overall this is a good movie, if you're in to suspense films. I wouldn't say this is as good as Silence of the Lambs. I watched this a while ago and liked it. It's an interesting movie that shows how far the antagonist will go to seek a different life.This particular version, however, is plagued by low volume levels with a 2.0 system. I had the Windows mixer, the PowerDVD volume, and the volume on my speakers at max and the dialogue was still pretty low. I suppose a lot of old movies being formatted for HD will probably have problems with 2.0 speakers, since most Home Theater systems are 5.1 or 7.1Overall, this movie is a 4 star at best. I chose 3 stars because of the volume issue I was having. And no, I don't need a hearing aid."
3,CATCHING FLYS,"A beautiful FBI profiler (Angelina Jolie) assists the Canadians with a serial killer investigation. The question is whether the killer is Keefer Sutherland or Ethan Hawke. As the story does everything it can to convince the viewer it's Sutherland, it must be Hawke. As Sutherland dies near the end, that leaves Hawke.TAKING LIVES is the story of a man who kills to assume the lives of others. From the time he was a younger twin he has wished he was someone other than himself. After killing his brother at a young age to gain the affection of his mother, he takes off and immediately begins killing and assuming lives. Who knows why and who really cares.Most of the movie is a cliche until Jolie has graphic sex with Hawke, whom she believes after the death of Sutherland is merely a great witness. When he turns out to be the killer she stages her pregnancy and catches/kills him in the last few minutes.Kind of ho-hum and nothing special."
2,Predicable to the hill.,"Very predicable thriller that does not leave much to the imagination in terms of the clues and who done it in the first place. I will not give it way but the commercials and the fact that it has been done before kind of killed the suspends the movie tries to have. Angelina Jolie is a good actress but she needs to read her roles more carefully, and this movie is not one for her to remember. E than Hawke is fine as well, but I could not get into his character, and Kiefer Sutherland does a throwaway role that adds nothing to the movie at all. Olivler Martinez has the worst part in the entire movie, and he comes across as unlikable which is hard because it more of a script problem than a personality one. The movie feels like it was just put out there with any thought, and the whole dark scenery just makes the viewer depress with what they are seeing. Take a walk out side before you put your money down for this movie."
3,A Real Look at the FBI,"This was a good psychological crime thriller. It is not as good as my favorite movie, Jeepers Creepers 2, and not even as good as Lara Croft - Cradle of Life, but Angelina Jolie is still very believable as an FBI criminal profiler. The best part is that you know who the serial killer is 10 minutes into the movie. Some people might say this makes it predictable, but when you know what the French cops can't figure out, it makes you feel very smart. I don't want to ruin the movie, but let's just say its got a great ending. It's even better than that movie The Village when you finally find out that the whole thing is taking place in modern times."
3,The ending sucked,"The movie held my attention until the ending. The ending was not what I expected or wanted. The movie is nothing like Silence of the Lamb and I'm not sure where the comparison comes from. The movie is however, exciting, and will keep you guessing. I just wish the ending had been better."
2,Could have been a real good movie,"The plot of this movie was intriguing and we love Angelina Jolie, but she's no more than a co-star in this film. The true star is actually Ethan Hawke. Unfortunately, this movie is slow, even boring at times. I don't know how you can take such a promising story line and make such a boring movie. There were opportunities for many plot twists but they just didn't follow through. We were very disappointed in this flick."
5,A great Film,"If your tired of seeing Angelina jolie acting like a spycho or bad girl, here she's smart and very accurate. She relly knows how to act, she really knows how to play this role and this is the great films. The story is great and interesting. If you want info e-mail me at JJ_025@lycos.com"
1,Didnt work,"Bought this and was really excited, but the knob on the side that switches the espresso drip to steam wouldnt work, when turned half the pressure came out the steamer and the drip..returned for credit"
2,Not so good,I would rather have spent more money and gotten a better automatic coffee maker.. This is too difficult for me to work it. I used it for a few days and now its just sitting there.I would not reccommend this product!
3,"Worked great at first, but developed peculiar taste","Worked wonderfully at first, but started to develop a funny taste within 30 brews. After cleaning the machine with a solution of vinegar & water it returned to normal, but has not lasted more than ten brews before sour taste returns. I've only ever used filtered water in it and have treated it like a baby; DeLonghi customer service suggested that my coffee was bad, but that would not explain how it goes from bad to good immediately after cleaning.Mechanically speaking it works as designed, and is relatively simple to operate and clean (save the taste issue)."
2,the glass jar was broken,very nice but the glass jar was brokenI write my note here because it is not possible to leave a seller feedback
4,Espresso treats on demand,"This delivers tasty espresso at a reasonable price. It is also equipped with a steam outlet for foaming milk to make cappuccino; however, and this is its only drawback, the nozzle for steam is a bit awkwardly positioned too close to the body of the coffeemaker. With practice one can get a container in position.The booklet with it helps by providing instructions as to proportions of milk to coffee. And after all, if the milk doesn't foam to your satisfaction, make a latte with it!This appliance is well worth the counter space it occupies."
1,"terrible machine, BIG waste of time & resources","it is poor quality, can not make decent espresso/capuchino. wasted coffee/milk and time on this machine. VERY UPSET! of cheap quality..buy anything else! We even went back to our old machine that wasnt expensive and over 5 years old(we use it daily) works a lot better!"
1,Doesn't Work,I received this product as a gift. The function that directs the steam through the frothing wand broke the first time just after a couple of uses. They replaced it and the same exact malfunction occurred. I can't recommend this product to anyone.
3,Late late late (latte?) Review...,"This was a very nice machine to use while it lasted, but like so many of these units by this and other makers, it just stopped working after about 6 months... something mysterious inside of them just goes ""poot"" and the things don't heat no mo'.... and trying to enforce a warranty or guarantee is far more trouble than just getting a new one. I now consider all these units ""disposable""..."
3,"Nice, but broke after 9 months","I was really enjoying this espresso maker, very easy to make, cheap and not using too much space, but after 9 months, the start buttonbroke and than I had a sort of explosition and couldn't use it anymore. I'm not sure how exactly the button broke, I just found it laying on the side one day. Maybe my cat pulled it out, but still, it's a bad quality if she can do it. I also never understood how to make foam.Anyway, I guess for 30 $ if it lasts 1 year, it's still good. I just ordered Emerson one for 82$ and I will see how this one works."
2,Be very careful with the 'frother' tube!,"We've had three, as the 'frother' broke on he first one. AND the second one (a free replacement from Home Hardware). Made of thin plastic, this part is a typical built-in obsolescence piece of xxxx. Third one now seems to have a broken element. Not getting another one.I'm here on Amazon trying to figure out what to get next. But my partner likes the quality of the capachino it makes. So if you buy it, be very careful with that frother. You need the correct-sized cup [=small] or else you'll easily bend it and break it."
3,Worked fine for about a year,"After a year, the coffee started tasting bad. When we cleaned it (using a descaler for coffee machines) the rinse water would be gray, even after 5 or 6 rinses. I suspect the aluminum was dissolving into the water. Maybe the descaler produce we purchased was the problem. In any case, we gave up and bought an Ikea stove-top stainless steel espresso pot which works fine."
2,"incomplete, and missleading.","The picture showes espresso maker with two espresso shot cups, that are not included with the product. Also, I like to make cappuccinos. If making a cappuccino, I need to supply my own container to steam my milk. Last, there is no way to steam milk without making espresso at the same time. So if you don't make it exactly right, you need to start over... This is the first and last time I will buy online."
4,Great Little Espresso Maker,"I am far from a connoisseur of coffee, but I really like this machine. Unlike the Krupps that is similar priced (FND111 Allegro), it is make much more sturdy. I played with both in a feature to feature comparison and the DeLonghi is MUCH better made.Best : Quality, quick espresso. Easy to clean, easy to use. Very attractive in the kitchen. Pretty darn quick. Great price for the quality.OK : Frother is very short, so you need a short, stout cup to froth with. It is good for Cappuccino, but not really powerful enough for steaming a Latte's worth of milk. To get some extra steam, run it through an extra cycle just for steam.Bad : Not really any for the price.Overall, I am very, very pleased. I got it for only $39.99 here on Amazon and I think that is one heck of a good deal."
3,Dislike Milk Steamer Wand,The milk steamer wand is so short and so close to the body of the machine that steaming milk is an awkward procedure.
4,Not as bad as you think,"I purchased this product about 3 years ago, I couldn't figure out how to use it so I gave up. Recently we got a new person in the office who wanted to use it so I said more power to you. She showed me how to get it going and with tips from my sister who used to work at a specialty coffee place, I feel professional. I make a great carmel macchiatta every morning. I think there may be a worn washer or something because I have to steam milk while the espresso is running (not what it's supposed to do) but I found a great rhythm and now I get very hot milk with an excellent thick foam. I keep my $4 in my pocket."
2,Not what I expected,This is a nice looking Espresso Maker. The problem I found with it is the steamer is made of a flimsy plastic and I thought it was going to break every time I used it. It is not in the right place on the machine to be able to steam a cup of milk. I would not purchase this machine again.
1,the worst kitchen item i have ever bought,"i hope to spare someone else the pain of buying this. i just watched a fountain of hot water shoot out all over my kitchen counter as i tried to steam a cup of milk. not being able to select between 'steam' and 'brew' modes is staggeringly stupid. i am going to deposit this in the garbage and buy a different machine. and to the person who said this is common in cheaper machines, i have NEVER owned or even saw a machine that has hot coffee shooting out the front while steam is pouring out the side. that's just stupid and dangerous."
2,Not for Italians,"If you're an Italian and live outside of the country don't buy this item, you won't like the kind of coffee that you get. Cappuccino comes out ok but again the machine doesn't have steam so you can't make a real expresso, cappucino and so on."
1,Does not steam milk...for the first few months...,"I'm updating my originally bad review. First the original:Very disappointed in this. It does not steam milk, no matter what type of milk I use, no matter what angle I tilt it at. I had a cappuccino maker for years so I know how to steam milk, and this thing just does not do it. I almost always have to run a second batch of water through just to re-steam the milk and try to get a little froth. Usually, though, I just suffer through a cappuccino that is no more than milky coffee, no froth. Bitterly disappointed.Several months later:Unexplainably, this thing started steaming milk properly. I did nothing different. Same milk. Same angle and depth of pitcher. But now it creates so much froth it will overflow the pitcher if I let it. I can't explain it. So if it doesn't work at first, I suppose you can just keep using it for a few months until it learns how to work."
1,Didn't live to its expectation,"I have purchased this espresso maker in January of this year and last August it just stopped working. The on-light is lit but no steam is being produced and if I remove the lid after a while, the water in it is not even hot. I don't use this machine that often. I mean once a day which is not a lot. My previous espresso machine was a Mr. Coffee and because two of my children were living with us at the time, it was being used about three times per day and it lasted about two years. This machine does have a 1 year warranty but since I only paid $35.10 is not worth shipping it or bringing it to the nearest DeLongui service center which is about 35 minutes from home. Next time I pay a little more and buy a better one. For now I am using a Betty Crocker that I picked up at a yard sale for 5 bucks. Is not top of the line but at least is making me some espresso which is more than I can say about the DeLongui."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"Is not available a switch for stream! Is a cappuccino maker? no, just a coffee maker. is a fake!"
1,the worst coffee machine ive ever owned and the worst product ever received from amazon.,"When I first unpacked this I noticed tiny metal fillings in the reservoir. Upon starting it up to clean it out with a run through with hot water the safety cap leaked.So I planned on returning it at that point but just wanted to see if I wanted a replacement or refund.Does not produce crema in fact it burns espresso badly.You have to froth milk while its dripping coffee.There is no way to get an exact amount of water to pull espresso shots and have enough steam left over for milk so you will always make a huge mess.The frother is short, angled horribly, and does not work well.This is a machine for people who do not understand coffee whatsoever.I would not even recommend as a drip machine.DO NOT PURCHASE FOR ANY REASON."
3,It's OK,"DeLonghi EC5 Steam-Driven 4-Cup Espresso and Cappuccino Maker, BlackUnit makes a decent cup but it's a little inconvenient to make one. My Mr. Coffee did a much better job, but they no longer make that model."
2,Decent espresso...will break in 5 months and they won't honor warranty,"I bought this espresso maker last September and at first I was pretty happy with it. It made decent espresso and unlike most reviewers, I didn't have trouble making foam. However, after only 5 months of using the machine it broke down. It just won't heat up the water, it really won't do anything. It is normal for these machines to break (though maybe not this fast). But what happened next is what is really bad. I called Delonghi, as the machine is under 1 year warranty and they did not want to honor the warranty. The excuse they used was that the machine was manufactured more than a year ago. So basically even though I bought the machine 5 months ago ago, they found an excuse to avoid honoring the warranty. Then they told me that I needed the original product receipt which I don't have anymore. However they should foresee that most people do not keep receipts. I HIGHLY ADVICE PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND!!"
1,"Poor design, even for the price","Just adding my agreement with the negative reviews. Received thi as a gift, but even for free it is almost useless. Might work OK if you are standing there to catch the exact moment when you can steam the milk while the coffee is brewing, but if you run out of steam and put more water into the machine to steam the other cups of coffee (remember it makes enough for 4 servings) you can't stop the extra water from percolating through the coffee making part. Either you end up with watery coffee, or a flood in the tray or have to put another vessel under the coffee spiggot.Coupled with the short little barely accessible steam spout and awkwardly placed steam knob (I don't have 2 right hands) it makes the morning cappucino not worth doing. I have had a number of other inexpensive expresso machines over the years and this is by far the worst."
2,Does not froth milk,"The expresso part of this machine works great, but it does not generate enough steam to froth the milk. Very disappointing, would not recommend this product."
4,Rockin' Espresso,"This is espresso machine number four for me and it is the best one I've had. I know you can spend a lot for a machine, but considering the low price for this one, it really does make great coffee. The top is a little difficult to screw on and off, but that is not a deal breaker."
1,Don't waste your money... Spend more and get a better machine..,This machine only allows for one cup per day... If you try making another one it just spits out water instead of steam thru the coffee and you get a burnt watered down taste... Forget about it..
1,"""jolted""!",I purchased the DeLonghi ECF Steam Driven 4 Cup Expresso maker back in July 2011. We use a cappacuino maker every day. But 5 months?REALLY DISAPPOINTED! Heating element gone and no pressure to make coffee. Glad we had a french press on hand. Buyer BEWARE!
2,Mediocre coffe maker,"To obtain an espresso and not regualar drip coffe, you need 2 main factors: pressure and temperature.Theis coffe machine doesn't have any of them. Coffe is not hot enough and the pressure is not enough to obtain a foamy black espresso.On top of that after the first cup, steam comes out in the coffe cup, ruining the second cup.Steam noozle is short and hard to operate."
2,Below average,don't expect a real Italian coffee maker!!! you get what you spend!the annoying part is that you have to refill it with water each time you use it!!!Buy a Bialetti moka instead!!!by an Italian.
3,Pretty good,"This product makes a great cup of espresso, and is pretty easy to use (if you read the manual--but then again I've never attempted to make coffee or espresso before, so maybe it's just me). The steamer did not seem to work at all to steam the milk. I don't know what that is about.."
3,"Nice as a back-up, not for longterm use","I really wanted to like this machine, but it was really hit or miss when it came to brewing. Many times that water just didn't come out I had to turn it off, wait, then turn it back on again to fake it out that it was making another espresso. I could not get it to brew 2 at a time either, it would only brew 1, and then the turn off/on ritual had to happen again. I used Illy Esspresso, which is a strong bean to begin with. Not getting enough water made it even stronger. I never got the foam topper either. Now that Tassimo is shipping again, this will go back in the box and stored in the garage until I decide to just ditch it altogether. Glad it was inexpensive."
2,4-cup espresso maker,"Was not really happy with this product. The steamer does not work, it is very small and not really user friendly."
3,less than a year,"I purchased this item in January. I used it happily, daily, with no problems until one day in October when it stopped working midway through brewing a cup. It wasn't too bad of a run for only $35. but I'll be upgrading with my next purchase.Also, I was never able to get the milk steamer to work well.The espresso was delicious."
1,disappointed,"I only used the machine once. It was difficult to get the cup of milk into the steamer because of the design on the frother wand. My last steamer used to release hot water or steam, this does both at the same time. I tried several times to get hot frothed milk, but the milk ended up lukewarm with a very disappointing amount of froth. Because I used this machine once I am not able to return it."
2,Just okay,"I like this ok, but the steam wand doesn't really froth the milk very well. Sometimes it does, others it doesn't. Then I have to heat the steamed milk in the microwave because it is still cold. I guess I'm not having much luck with it. But after all the extra work my lattes taste good! Overall I guess it doesn't work the best."
3,Confusing...,"I got this machine as a Christmas gift. It works fine but the manual is off. This machine does not have a knob on the top to indicate what you want to do, as the manual indicates. So i have to steam the milk while the espresso is coming out and it is just crazy! if i put too much water, i get too much espresso. If I don't put enough water I can't properly steam my milk! it's frustrating. I guess i'm used to my old machine. I wish i could find a few tips on how to use it and kinda multitask without making a mess of my kitchen."
1,This is a joke!,"Before I bought this ""Espresso and Cappuccino Maker"", I did my research and read as many bad reviews as I could. But, since it looked like such a great deal, I decided to give it a try, anyway. MISTAKE! I really should have listened and walked away. Now I am stuck and have had to warm up the milk in the microwave just to make a cappuccino, simply because the steaming wand DOES NOT WORK. This is NOT an Espresso and Cappuccino Maker I expected to get for almost $40 - This is really just a regular coffee maker and anyone can easily get one at Target for $20."
2,Frustrating to use the steam nozzle,"Like some other reviewers, I must say this machine seems to brew espresso just fine, but the design flaw lies in the placement and function of the steam nozzle. The steam valve must be opened as the espresso begins to drip, and the machine runs out of steam before frothing or warming the milk when brewing 2 shots of espresso. I have had some success when brewing 4 shots, as the machine produces more steam, but the placement of the steam nozzle makes it very frustrating to use. It is easy to bump the espresso carafe away from the drip outlets, and the milk container must be tilted in order to get the steam nozzle inside, making it very easy to spill."
2,Espresso Maker,This product was re-furbished and came in a bit dirty. It's easy to use and makes espresso quick but the steam wand is terrible. It does not make the milk hot and does not let out enough steam.
2,Not as good as expected,I bought the machine mainly for cappuccino. But the pressure of steam is really pathetic and it goes away after 5-10 seconds.There was no seperate system for steam. I had to return it.
1,POOR QUALITY MACHINE,Only half to two-thirds of water went through after the second time of use. Not reccomented.
1,Not worth the time and effort,My husband and I love cappuccino. I got this for us for Christmas and we sent it back. It is a lot of steps and work to get a tiny little cup of cappuccino. Basically we paid a lot of money and spent time just to get some foam milk to poor on top of coffee or espresso. Instead I bought a Tassimo one cup machine by Bosch and ordered the Starbucks coffee disks and milk disks and it is awesome! So simple and makes a large delicious foamed milk on top coffee.
2,Cheap but made cheaply,"If you have ever owned an espresso maker, then stay away from this. It is to real espresso makers as ez bake oven is to a stove. It worked and cost $35. But it is toy plastic quality. I haven't been able to froth yet. Looks nice from a distance."
5,DeLonghi Cappuccino Maker,"I love my little Cappuccino Maker. Now we are enjoying the best cappuccino at home,and it's a lot better then in Starbucks!My family and friends all love it too!"
1,Very big design flaw,"As some of the other reviews state, there is no knob or switch on the EC5 to go from Foaming to Espresso drip. Which means if you want a cappuccino you have to froth the milk at the same time as dripping the coffee. The problem lies in that the frothing wand is way too close to the machine and it's difficult to use while the coffee is dripping. Secondly if you don't put enough water and you estimate incorrectly the wand never produces enough steam to make a nice froth. If you put too much water you will make perfect froth however the coffee will be very watery because you had to add water to make enough steam.. it's kinda a double edged sword. And more hassle than it's worth too. I am surprised that every machine doesn't have a knob or switch to adjust between froth and drip. Very big disappointment, am going to have to go out and buy a new machine most likely."
1,Not so good,Read the reviews before I ordered this and thought I would still give it a try. It was BAD. I returned it after spending a day wasting my $20 coffee from Starbucks. Do not buy this machine.
4,Nice gift,The glass cup was broken:( Otherwise nice product. I will contact the buyer to see if it can be replaced.
4,NO GOOD TO MAKE CAPPUCCINO,"Maybe good for espresso, but the so-called milk frother is basically a waste. Cannot work. For cappuccino lovers like me, do not choose this one."
1,metal smell and flavor,"I really wanted to like this machine. Besides the fact that I toyed with it to finally get the steam to froth a little bit of milk, which is hard because it is small, the espresso always tasted bad. By the end of the week, my espresso was unbearable, that's when I noticed the metal carafe smelled awful-- like lead or heated raw pipes. I had to throw it away. I don't know if my was defective but the metal aroma was too much. Will look for another model will rave reviews. That smell was so acrid that I can still sense it on my palate and in my nose. Barf!"
1,Very sad I threw away the box,"I don't often write reviews, but I received this product as a gift and am very disappointed with the performance. I stood in the kitchen for an hour trying desperately to get this machine to steam my milk. I even tried running it several times in a row with just plain water in order to produce enough steam to froth the milk. As other reviewers stated, there is no option to turn off the coffee drip and use only the steam arm, which ends up not generating enough stream to do anything. Don't waste your money on this machine. You would be better off trying to heat the milk by blowing into it with a straw."
4,satisfied and full of caffiene!,"I have had my espresso machine for about a month now and for the price I paid could not be happier! Anyone who is considering purchasing keep in mind how cheap this machine is so you don't expect it to run like a 100$ machine, because it won't. With that point made I do love my machine and it makes me lots of Yummy espresso! The steamer is not great, I usually end up having to microwave my milk after getting some foam on top but again for the cheap price I'm ok with that. Saves me SO much money overall now that I don't have to go to the coffee shop and waste 6$ a day for a drink. Super excited to finally own my own machine, have wanted one forever!"
1,Didn't last very long,"This espresso maker was great while it lasted. Made good coffee and quickly, a plus on those sleepy mornings. But it only lasted 13 months. One morning it was just dead."
1,Get a machine with separate frothing and brewing functions like the Capressa 302,having to froth at the precise moment the steam begins forming in the brewer is ridiculous. I have never gotten it right and it runs out of steam before the milk even gets warm. Nightmare from a company such as DeLonghi. I would have expected much more! I have a Capressa 302 and it lets you switch between brewing and frothing or neither so the machine can concentrate it's energy on the function at hand. So simple. This Delonghi gives you no options or control. It's either on or off and you better be ready with cup poised!
3,Makes Good Coffee But Has Design Flaws,"I bought this for my mother her Krups stopped working after 7 years of daily use. I read bad reviews for the new Krups so I decided on this one. I didn't pay attention to the criticisms of the steam frothing valve because she doesn't use it. But what has become a problem is that it gets in the way and it makes it difficult to get the carafe in and out. The top of the carafe has to be exactly right because of the way it's designed and she's had a few spills because of it. The coffee comes out OK- just like in the Krups, now I'm sorry that I didn't get that one- at least we're familiar with the design. The price for this one, however, was better."
1,"Good when it works, very poor customer service","I owned this machine for 14 months. While it was a decent low priced steam based espresso maker, it died (would not heat water at all) after 14 months of once a day service. I contacted Delonghi to inquire what could be done, and they replied ""nothing at all. Is there any other product we can help you with?"" I would believe they would have made some kind of concession as it was only 60 days out of warranty. Oh well. Buying another Krups espresso maker, as my last Krups lasted 3 years without fail."
1,Save up for a better one.,"Everytime I make an espresso or capacino with this machine, I take 5 minutes to clean up the mess it creates. From spitting coffee/espresso all over the counter while it's trying to brew, to getting coffee grinds in the milk I'm trying to froth...my recomendation would be to save up for a nicer one with more features and nicer quality. But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for."
2,"Great for brewing espresso, but that's it.","The consensus here is correct. This machine is perfectly fine if you just want a cup or two of espresso, but don't get your hopes up about making great, frothy lattes and cappuccinos. I start my mornings off with a cup of espresso to get me going and the machine works fine, but on the weekends I occasionally like to enjoy a latte with my morning paper. I've tried about a dozen times to steam and froth milk with this machine and all I get is a few bubbles. The milk has barely a thin layer of froth and is still ice cold. Now I nuke the milk in the microwave and use a frother. I guess you get what you pay for. I recommend going with a higher-end product if you want the whole package."
2,Not very good,"The little black plastic piece that is supposed to steam the milk is too short to reach the bottom of a normal sized cup. It says in the instructions to leave room for the milk to expand 3 times its size, but this is impossible because the steamer only extends about an inch away from the espresso maker. I don't know if my family is doing something wrong, but every time we have tried to steam milk with this thing, it barely makes bubbles in the surface of the milk and it definitely does not warm it up."
2,Plastic Junk,Nearly all made of plastic. The steamer doesn't work well so can really steam milk and make coffee. The coffee taste funny.. I went back to my simple plastic cone. This was a waste of money.
1,It is very difficult to use (it took 3 calls to the company and ab; it does not steam the milk; it makes only 1 cup instead of 2,"Very difficult to use (3 calls to company needed), then at least an hour to get it running; it does not steam the milk; it makes only 1 cup instead of 2."
1,horrible machine! save your money!,this is perhaps the worst buy ever! no room to use steamer wand ! it sits about an inch above the drip tray! ridiculous design!as with all things use your judgement!As an experienced shopper for home espresso machines in some architectural views form follows function... I must say this holds to be true with most home espresso machines! sturdy reliablesstainless is always good doesn't have to be an expensive home machine! pump option is good with a good wattage. Note: make sure milk steamer and and steam pressure knob are clearly marked and has plenty of SPACE below steam wand for home size milk pitcher! Delonghi used to be Italian now its out of New Jersey! give me a break! I hope this helps all of you and good luck! You can get a decent home machine for no more than 44.00! if you shop righT! :D
1,"No Cappuccino, good espresso","This product produces good espresso but as for the Cappuccino, forget it. It does not have a selector switch to direct the steam form the coffee to the cream. It does not produce enough steam to froth milk. I have been trying to work it for 2 weeks now.....NO FROTHING!! The coffee is made very quickly but no frothing milk as the directions and customer service would like you to think. BUYER BEWARE. Good Cappucino but forget the frothing milk. I'm returning mine to the store."
2,Had to send back,Worked a little when I first received it but not how I was expecting it to. Broke with in a week. I would not recommend.
3,"okay espresso, bad frother","This machine was given to me as a gift in 2007. I clean it regularly and don't use it terribly often. It makes a good espresso, but the milk steamer is almost if not completely useless. It worked great for about three months, but now it only gets about half of the steam pressure it used to, no matter how much I clean it.Other than that, it does a pretty good job -- just make sure to buy decent coffee."
2,Very unconfortable.,That is totally different than PIC.Very uncomfortable. It takes forever to make one cup of espresso.
5,Great machine for this price!,I am very glad that I bought this machine! Espresso and cappuccino are very good!
1,Nice Espresso and Cappuccino Maker,"i have used it about a week. And i am comfortable with this maker.You will get what you pay for. but with this price this maker will give you backa good coffee.The only negative ting is the water tank. Every time you will make coffee then you have to open thewater tank and close it. its not a big issue but........At all i will advise this one to all of you who does not like to pay a lot money, but will get a good coffee maker.For those who lives in EU:This coffee maker is 120 V. if you country voltage is 220 V, then you have to buysome electric converter.Now after 2 or 3 weeks this machine does not work any more!!!!!!!!!Be Obs, Its not going to work as long as you thought !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"It has died, already!!","This is the third DeLonghi EC5 Steam-Driven Espresso and Cappuccino Maker I have owned. The first lasted for a few years. In fact, it wasn't dead when my daughter gave me a new one and told me to get rid of the old one. Well, that one lasted a year. And, so I replaced it with this one, and it lasted a few weeks. The water isn't heating enough to create steam, although it did for a few weeks.....I am still trying to decide if I want to order the same model or go to a different brand. Maybe, DeLonghi has gone down the tubes???"
4,"Good Value, Good Quality","i've owned this product for several years now. it may be plastic, but don't let that fool you. for the inexpert, this machine is super easy to use. and for the expert barista like myself, the espresso tastes pretty darned good. i make a mocha nearly every morning. i don't use the frothing wand 'cause i'm used to a high-powered one. i heat my milk on the stove or in the microwave. for this price, it's worth the money. lately, however, i have noticed the steam is escaping from the lid. which means, i think, the seal is not working properly. but, i've gotten what i paid for out of it, which was about the same price as amazon. like i said, i've had this machine for several years. and for a delonghi product, the quality can't be beat!"
3,"Love it, but there are no instrutions on how to use it.","I unpacked everything and grabbed the manual. Two pages in and it started over again in a different language. It described what each button was, but no where did it say how to use the machine."
2,Not an Espresso Maker,This machine is a run of the mill coffee maker and in no way resembles a cappuccino or espresso maker.
4,Great Little Espresso Maker and Money Saver,"This little gem was a holiday gift and I have used it every day since I received it. I am always on the go and usually stop off at my local coffee shop for a latte before work. I've already saved money using this espresso maker, and after a little practice, can now make lattes as good as anything I've ever paid $5 a cup for. The steamer is a little awkward (which is why 4 stars vs five), but I started putting a regular sized cup under the espresso filter and using the handled glass cup for the milk frothing. The handle makes it easier to do - then I pour everything in my large to-go cup. Here's a tip - add a bit of vanilla extract to the milk before frothing. Mmmmm, vanilla latte!"
2,Good While It Lasts -- But That's Not Long,"Definitely good for your money as far as WHAT it achieves, but for HOW LONG it does that you are better off spending more on a more reputable brand. After exactly a year (how convenient for DeLonghi, warranty-wise), it started heating the water so only half to two-thirds went through, then the rest would go after a 10-minute delay. Three months later, today, it is not heating any water whatsoever. Time to go shopping for a new one. It DEFINITELY won't be DeLonghi. I was happy with the machine before, as it made good, timely espresso with a wonderfully easy froth. Now, I realize if I had just spent double, I could have had a better machine that lasted 5 years. My last $70 Krups lasted that long. [NOTE: I use my espresso machine daily.]"
3,Mine was a good buy for the money,"My husband bought this after doing reseach as well as reading the reviews posted on this site. We have to agree with all posters that the frother does not heat the milk just luke warm at best. Also where they placed it is kind of inconvenient and too short. We came up with two tricks that helped both issues. In regards to the frothing heat issue, we discovered to make our espresso and wait for complete cycle to brew (do not use frother). Once brewed, we refill the water to the 2 cup level into the maker and then we turn the forther to full open level. You will find that this will heat the milk it as much as you like and the froth is excellent. Basically it adds 2-3 minutes to the process. For the second issue (short stem) we use two cookbooks as a lift base and this gives us the height and convenience needed. I know it sounds quirky but for the price of $26.00 all in I can't complain and I get my morning cups of joy. Hope this helps anyone that is on the fence."
1,"If you've had an older Delonghi, you won't like this one!","I had an old Delonghi and, noting the positive reviews on this one, I decided to order a new unit. It is much lighter in weight, a fact that I consider a big negative in an espresso maker. Also, the froth tube does not extend away from the unit -- this is terrible! I could go on about the quality of this unit but I believe these 2 things are most important. I think it's best to find one in a store that you like and come back to Amazon for reviews and possible purchase."
1,Not as expected.,It cannot make steamed milk by itself and has to be with the brew. Also no water meter. Returned product and purchased DeLonghi EC155.
1,Worst machine ever.,"I have used cheaper machines, more expensive ones, to make lattes. I purchased the Delonghi after reading positive reviews. Frankly, I am surprised by them after having given this machine not one but two tries. By which I mean that I purchased the machine, used it daily for the span of a month, then replaced that one and used the new one daily for the past two months. The first one I received was atrocious and I thought it was defective. The steam wand is impossible to use and it does not matter how good of a coffee grade I get, the machine will ALWAYS yield watery coffee. I returned the first one and received a new one. This new one has been equally impossible to wield. This machine will not make lattes, foam, or even heat milk properly. I you just want a espresso makers, there are cheaper ones that are just as good. If you want to make lattes, go elsewhere. Even Mr. Coffee has better models (and that tells you how bad this one is). Everyone in my family who tried it agree."
2,Not the complete show. Save your money,Most videos of Andre Rieu were complete as suggested. This one video falls way short of content. About 30 minutes shy of the complete show.I would not purchase this video. Save your money.
3,Radio City Hall,"Not as good or as long as other concerts such as the 2010 Sydney concert. Enjoyed it never the less,"
4,Great Music Video,Love his music. Something I will enjoy over and over again. I bought it to watch on days when there is nothing on tv.
4,Not so impressed,"Andre Rieu: Radio City Hall Live in New York (2007)I am great fan of Andre and his people; however i didn't like this DVD as much as the others that i have. I do not like Gospel music and this is not what i want to listen too. However i agree the mixture of the two cultures was absolutely wonderful.Where was beautiful ""Carmen""?I also thought it was too American, i have had enough of being blasted by Americana, as wonderful as it may be. Some American music for the locals would have been very nice but again too much of a good thing can be too much!To conclude i will not be buying a copy!Regards Iandor"
2,A big disappointment,"We are expecting to hear the usual great music from this organization, but when they came to New York City they were a big disappointment. Not enough of the great orchestral classics and beautiful music, not nearly enough participation by the superior musicians to whom we have become accustomed. Instead, we have here a concert based on the Harlem Choir, with interruptions from time to time by the great music. Nowhere to be seen or heard are such marvelous artists we associate with an Andre Rieu concert such as Carmen Monarcha. Save the money for one of his other products."
3,"Disappointed, not like earlier DVD's by Andre Rieu.","Good music, but missing the special that he has in several other DVDs. I don't know if I will watch it a second time."
2,Not a great concert,"I love Andre Rieu but I feel that he lost it on this concert. It was like he did not know what to play to entertain the wierd New Yorkers and the concert came out as a mismage of trite pieces and bad chorus work. Most of his other concerts are wonderful and if you enjoy the enthusiasm of the European audiences and the music he plays for them, you will not enjoy this concert at all."
1,andre rieu radio city hall live in new york,"I treied to play the cd in 3 different cd players, it did not play. I had to return it and I am waiting for a reply to hear you received it and my credit card was credited. Thanks."
1,Dissappointed,"Looking forward to another wonderful concert, I opened my new DVD only to be dissappointed as it was the same as ""NEW YORK MEMORIES"" that I had purchased previously so I have returned the DVD to you and asre now waiting to hear from you or to receive a refund on my credit card....Carol Coram"
2,Andre Rieu in New York 2006,"I have almost everything Andre Rieu has and this was just passable. The Harlem folks are the ones that messed it up. Their music has no business being with Andre Rieu, who has class. I bought the DVD and am happy that I can just jump to the next track to avoid the Harlem music (if that is what you call music). Would I buy it again, well yes, but still with the opportunity to jump past some of the tracks. And Andre seemed to be ""out of place here"" and I think he was glad it was over. And there was only one song played by the little boy, disappointing."
5,Pure joy from start to finish!,"I have several of Andre Rieu's DVDs and while most of them are enjoyable, this one is the best so far, in my opinion. Unlike one of your previous reviewers, I thought the Harlem Gospel Choir was great and suited a concert recorded in New York at Radio City Music Hall very well. I also like to see the audience and all the featured soloists so I enjoyed the way it was filmed. You almost feel that you are there! The repertoire was a 10 ... all among my favourite pieces and well chosen to capture many moods. Everything was played beautifully with contagious enthusiasm. This is definitely a keeper. You can't help but feel great after playing it."
5,RECEIVED VERY PROMPTLY WITH THANKS,vERY PLEASED WITH THE ITEM I RECEIVED AND MOST HAPPY WITH THECORRESPONDENCE AND SUCH PROMPT DELIVERY
5,"Andre Rieu, ""Live in New York""..GREAT","Andre is world-renowned for his own abilities and those show on this video. However, he does wonders in showcasing the talents of the little violinist and the Harlem Gospel Choir. The combined-group performance of ""Messiah"" was breathtaking. It is overall a grand DVD to own."
1,I was turned on off by this Ham,"I guess I'm the only one here to say it, or maybe everyone is being nice. I found this guy to be the biggest Ham.This guy belongs on the Vegas strip doing a Siegfried and Roy impersonation.The Blue Danube Waltz was very nice but any professional orchestra can play music. I thought the singers voices were average. The tenors , I mean I can sing like that in she shower.This guy hammed it up,and really it was disgusting to watch.The little boy playing the violin looked very angry at something.The female singer's voices sounded like off broad way singers and it looked a some cheap musical with the ham at the front telling me he is my friend.It's showtime at the Apollo featuring YANNII'm surprised he didn't do a bullfight.I'm sorry to say this, I just feel the public has been taken by this guy."
3,Tank Shield,Hard to know as a consumer whether or not this works.Do recommend that you use gloves. Smell very hard to get off hands.
4,Great!,It is beneficial to the translators who are too poetic and like to see past the koine greek simplicity and clearity. This grammatical analysis is great to keep our translatiions and understanding of scripture in sync with the authors intent.
5,Useful,"It's a wonderful reference book for anyone who knows a little Greek and wants to read NT in the language it was written in. It provides translation for almost EVERY word apart from simple ones. This way one can basically try to read NT without any dictionary even during an elementary course.The book is however something more than just a contextual dictionary. It contains also some elements of a grammatical commentary. For example, I learned from it that the form 'pros to' in 'blepon gynaika pros to epithymesai auten' (Mt 5:28) may render a Semitic construction with force of gerund ('lusting', 'with lust').The edition is Catholic. If you're not Catholic yourself, don't worry. It's still something you should have in your personal library. The book doesn't seem to have any ideological bias. It represents a pure linguistic approach."
2,Nice design but poor electronics!,"I ordered this phone based on the positive reviews I read here. The phone is really sharp looking and seems sturdy, but the sound quality is terrible. There is an almost constant hissing static (especially when I'm talking - it's like when it's transmitting out). I placed in the same location of my old GE cordless phone (also a 900mz and clear as a bell), so I don't think that's the problem. It's going back!"
2,Just thought I'd mention,"Hey, just thought I'd inform everyone that they might want to reconsider a Vtech phone. I had mine for about 2 years, and over the last 6 months I had it, it wouldn't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes - and then shut off. I would charge it for over 24 hours and then use it - and nothing but 5-10 minutes. I recently got a new phone for Christmas, and we trashed the old one. The new one is a Motorola Disney Princess phone - which, if I can find on Amazon, I will give 5 stars to. The new phone is great - fits my face comfortably, has great volume and sound, cute ringers, fits my hand well, has caller I.D, and comes on a stand-up base that I never thought to be better before, but is really convenient to not have to worry about laying it down against the charger correctly (no clicking it into the right spot in the dark). My phone was in the mid-$$ range at Target, and well worth it. I recommend my phone - or any Motorola - over than a Vtech."
5,phone perfect for family with kids,"we bought this phone about a year ago and it is so great its very inexpensive and the quality is outstanding. the sound is still crisp and clear it still works from anywhere in my house, etc. but the most amazing thing abt this phone, is its nicknamed the ""tuff phone"" well it lives up to its name my family has thrown it dropped it down stairs evrything, you name it, they droped it down it. but it is still working amazingly. it is my belif that with anyother phone this could not b possible, and in a family like mine with 3 kids, we woulda had to buy a new phone every 2 months. thanx Vtech."
4,Not just like the old one,"I bought this phone because I had the VTech 9111 and it was killed by the blackout of 2003, (Well, it still works as a phone, just the ringer doesn't work) Anyway I bought the 9117 because it looks a lot like the old 9111 and as far as I can tell, the performance is the same. Vtech has gone the extra mile and added a screw to hold the battery door shut (If you owned and old Vtech you will agree that was the only flaw with them, drop the phone and the battery would fall out) The only problem I have with this new design, is that it says wall mountable, but in wall mount position, it hangs out from the wall like a shelf other than that I think this phone will be about as bullet proof as the old 9111. I have to say the the quality of Vtech phone shows that these people have years of experence building childrens toys that can take a beating and they have applied it to an adult product that can take a beating."
2,Not a very good quality phone,"I bought this phone almost exactly a year ago. It had some cool features and yadda yadda, it worked alright when I got it. There is constant static. Now when I get too far from the base (about 30 ft.) it makes a horrible clicking noise. It worked just fine before (except maybe the static). It is a poor quality product. I don't recommend this."
4,before its time,"I recalled this record from a brilliant summer decades ago when the BBB version of ""Work Song"" played on Nuri Nuri's Sunday Morning Blues Hour. Memory often serves music from the sixites better than digitalization. Most of the recording is difficult to listen to, but ""Work Song"" and ""East-West"" speak to the higher level of aspirations of the time and the musicians."
2,Mike Vargo was kind,"He's right on the mark regarding the 2nd rate material.The US version of this is very sorry indeed.Finally a CD that sounds even worse than well worn vinyl.Electra should be ashamed of ever putting this out in the first place without remastering. Completely sonically challenged.If you must, buy the double import - at least you get the 1st CD as well."
1,YOU'RE BUYING THE WRONG CD!,"Yes, this is the great PBBB's 2nd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying.This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 1st album) is the one to get. It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001.Ditto for ""Pigboy Crabshaw"" & ""In My Own Dream""; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports!Link to the import remasteredPaul Butterfield Blues Band/East West"
5,East -West by Paul Butterfield,This is a great blues album that stands up well after all these years.I replaced a vinyl copy and heard things I hadn't heard since I saw them live.
3,"just okay,nothing special","This CD is okay,noyhing special, and not all that original. Stick to Kid Rock his music is much better."
3,More Tribute than Documentary,"This film is more of a tribute to Thompson than a revealing documentary about his life and work. Hunter's famous friends (Johnny Depp, Sean Penn, Bill Murray, Harry Dean Stanton, Eugene McCarthy, Gary Hart, Ed Bradley, William Buckley, etc.) take turns honoring him with reminiscences and personal anecdotes that mostly reinforce the well known image of the frequently-inebriated-but-brilliant maverick that is Thompson's public persona. If you're a fan of Thompson's looking for soothing closure on his life and career, then this is the movie for you. If, on the other hand, you are looking for in-depth analysis of Thompson's writing and its impact on journalism and politics, look elsewhere."
5,Worth The Money!,"I put a power twist belt on my Craftsman contractors saw. The vibration has been greatly reduced. With the original v-belt, if a nickel was placed on it's edge on the table top and the saw started, the nickel would immediately fall on it's side and the vibration would cause it to ""walk"" all over the table.With the link belt, the nickel stays standing on edge, and doesn't move AT ALL.I haven't noticed any change in sound level.My drill press will get these next, to see if they eliminate the low pitched rumble the belts create in the powerhead."
2,"Don't Want to Rain On Anyone's Parade, but...","...it sure didn't work for me. In spite of having balanced the wheels and having installed and carefully aligned machined cast iron V-belt pulleys, my Delta bandsaw still had an annoying vibration. Since the belt was old and worn and had taken a bit of a set, I figured that had to be the problem. So after reading the gushing reviews here, I bought a Power Twist belt. No dice. If anything, it made the vibration worse. Since it's still a functional drive belt, I'll give it two stars, but it certainly fell far short of expectations."
5,Ingenius,The guy who thought these things up should be given the Nobel Prize in wood in engineering. Incredibly practical. User friendly. Adaptability is almost limitless. Love'm.
5,Vibration killer!,"These belts are the smoothest running belts you will ever find. It won't take a set if the equipment isn't used for a while- no thump-thump like other belts will do.I have PowerTwist belts on my Jet drill press, Jet jointer, and Jet bandsaw. The only reason I don't have them on my tablesaw is that it's a Ridgid, and they use polygroove belts; I had PowerTwist on my Craftsman tablesaw before it was destroyed in a wildfire three years ago.I bought a 25-foot pack a couple of years ago, and it's been enough to do my shop and my Dad's. Much more economical than buying five feet at a time."
3,Helps vibration but noisy,"I bought this belt through Peachtree Woodworking. It definitely helped with vibration but the noise level was on the high pitched side which really annoyed me. I have it on a 10"" Delta Contractor's saw. I have switched belts back and forth several times to try and pinpoint the problem. I have more vibration with the old factory belt but no noise. I'm at a loss. Right now it's sitting on the shelf."
1,Didn't work for me,"I installed this item in place of the factory-supplied belt on my Powermatic 64A table saw (excellent saw, by the way). The saw was already running quiet and mostly smooth, but I was enticed by the thought of it being even smoother. Installation: The belt kept riding up on the pulleys, though I hadn't changed the alignment, and I had to mess with the motor mount, and mess, and mess, for about an hour till it spanned well. When it was mounted, the belt seemed no smoother but a LOT louder -- a high-frequency whine the saw never had before. I held off buying this item for a long time, because of the cost, and I should have left well enough alone."
5,Why did I wait so long?,"I heard about these belts from some articles that I had read in some woodworking magazines. I thought, maybe someday, but not right now. After my last project, out of frustration with my machine, I decided to buy one. I have a Grizzly contractors grade table saw. Nice machine, just shook a bunch. I didn't even read the instructions for sizing the belt. It took less than 2 minutes to remove the old one, size the powertwist to length and install it. It was that easy. I stood both a nickel and a penny on edge and threw the switch. I just stared in amazement as they both just stood right where I placed them. Don't wait to buy this belt, or you'll be asking yourself ""Why did I wait so long?""."
2,Not Recommended for Furnace Blower,"The belt was easy to install, as recommended by others. However, this belt should NOT be used on a furnace/HVAC squirrel-cage blower. The vibration echos through the ducts throughout the house. It was so bad I made a special trip into town on Saturday night to replace it. Be sure you install the original OEM belt in this application."
5,works great,Sometimes several months go by with my table saw just sitting there. There is NEVER any memory issues with this belt.
2,Not up to standards of Denise Austin,"I've used Denise Austin items for years and have been happy. I was not happy with this video. Her pace was too quick and she did not give instructions beforehand. There was a woman on the video who was doing the ""modified"" version but she didn't state that too well into the program. She changes everything quickly without notification and with little instruction in ""how to"". Very disappointed. I would recommend that anyone buying this video sit through it first so you can see the changes. It is not a difficult one if you are just starting out, just confusing and it does accomplish its purpose."
3,Good Workout,"This is a good workout, but it's not much fun. I like fast upbeat workouts. Denise is great in everything...this video is just not one of my favorites."
2,Boring,"I found this workout to be very boring and I don't see myself doing it often, if at all. It is also not very intense so if you are an advanced exerciser I would say skip this one. However, if you are a beginner and don't like fast paced, tricky choreography this might be a good place to start."
3,Definitely Burns!,"I am a dance/pilates/ballet/fusion girl, but I need to lose weight for my wedding, so I wanted to give some traditional cardio work a try with this. It certainly does amp your metabolism up. I am burning for the next full day. I don't love the exercises though. You train like an athlete in this, and that just isn't what I'm going for. I will probably still try to work it in if I'm feeling especially fat or self-loathing."
3,Not bad,"i'm always looking for new workout videos, especially now that exercisetv is gone. the video will make you sweat which at the end of the day is all i really want. that being said, the ques are pretty bad so you usually miss the first move or so of a circuit. also her voice makes it sound like she's always just been punched in the stomach which is kind of a annoying. there are probably other videos i'd buy before this one, but like i said, it gets the job done."
1,college writer,"this book was ordered and I found out it was the wrong book,so we had to order the right book this time."
5,Juat about the finest small jig in my arsenal,"If you hang doors, you absolutely need the Porter-Cable 126 Portaplane. If you do cabinet work, you'd best invest in the Kreg pockethole jig. My bar clamps and doweling jig will be consigned forevermore to the back of the shop. I was skeptical of the claims that this little tool could make face frame construction so quick, effortless, and accurate, but after five minutes of work I was sold on it. It's everything Kreg claims that it is! Note: I ran out of Kreg's screws at the end of my last project and wondered if any other # 6 screw MIGHT work in a pinch. I needed just four more to finish the job. I tried drywall screws after reaming out the flat base of the bore...forget it. The key is the flat base of the screwhead, the pitch of the threads, AND the self tapping point. All designed to work together in a near-perfect little system. Avoid any knock-offs. 6 stars."
5,Worked as expected,"I have read about several projects using this jig in The Family Handyman. Well, I finally found one that I wanted to build, so I bought the Pockethole jig. I drilled over fifty holes to join a few dozen joints and the jig performed as expected. I have never used a biscuit joiner or dowels (or any other joint technique, for that matter) so I really don't have anything else to compare to. It has seemed like a good purchase so far."
2,Dissapointed,I have a Kreg pocket hole jig that is about 10 years old. It is solid and very well made. I purchased the new one thinking that it would be a faster tool to use. I was disapointed. It is made of light plastic with steel inserts in thge drill guide holes. The clamp is too light and mot made well. The tool will be in the back of my shop and never used. I think it is over priced. Do not waste your money.
5,Everyone needs one,"The only thing wrong with pocket holes is that feeling you are cheating somehow. The other reviewers seem to be cabinet makers and serious dudes. I'm a hobbyist and homeowner. EVERYONE needs one of these, especially for this price. So much you can do with it and the joints feel really strong. The jig is good quality; would last someone like me a lifetime. Wayyyyyy too easy."
4,Pocket Hole Screw Systems,"I had put off making cabinets because my few feeble attempts at using dowels were a failure. Never could get them to align properly even using doweling jigs that cost nearly as much as this tool.I needed to spruce up my garage and wanted some custom sized wall cabinets. After watching Norm on The New Yankee Workshop use the pocket screw system, I ordered this tool from Amazon and went for it.Kreg R2 Rocket Pockethole SystemI must say I was amazed at how easy it was and how tightly the joints on the face frames fit together. My cabinets turned out very nice.I used poplar for the face frames and used the 1-1/4 inch coarse screws.Tip: Buy an assortment of the screws in different lengths. They come in handy for non-pocket uses due to the #2 square drive head. I used the 2-1/2 inch screws to mount the cabinets on the walls.It's a nice tool for the occasional cabinet maker and I'm sure I will find other projects to make use of it."
3,Beware if you can program.,"This book was an okay book if you have never programmed before. I assumed that it would cover game design and 2D/3D animation, however, it started with many chapters on storing data and numbers. It then covered many commands in DarkBASIC, but not doing things outside of DarkBASIC, like making AVI's and animated sprites. As good as the software was, this was clearly a beginners guide to programming. If you have programmed before and bought DarkBASIC to make games, note this does not cover game making, but basic programming. Also, alough it says it does, it does not cover DarkBASIC Pro well. When it gives an old command (that does not work with pro), it does not mantion it does not work with pro, nor does it show that in it's printed source code. I found a few chapters helpful, but you can get more help from the online forms. If I could, I'd give this 2 and 1/2 stars."
3,not for those into 3D,"This book is GREAT for the very beginner, but if you want to make good 3D games, do not buy this book. it barely touches on terrains and collisions. there is only one chapter on 3D games, and it is not thorough. the majority of the book is dedicated to 2D and basic ""hello world"" style programs. if you want to make 3D games, visit the DarkBASIC forums and skip this book."
4,Beginner's Guide to DarkBASIC Game Programming,"The book was advertised as ""good"" condition; I would characterize it as ""very good."" The original CD was included, and works perfectly. Perhaps the best news is that it came in just 3 days!"
2,Beginners only...,"I ordered this book after installing DarkBasic Pro on my PC. By time the book arrived, I'd had already outgrown the material.If you have never programmed before, this book would probably be useful, as the first 200 pages cover basic programming techniques; loops, data types etc.If you are already familiar with programming, then there is not much useful information. There are only a 50 pages on 3d programming and only a few of the relevent funtions are covered.Mostly the book is fluff. There are shots of every screen that comes up during the install of Dark Basic.(7 pages)""Figure 1.60 The Setup Status screen, which displays the installation progress""I realize that the book says 'Beginners Guide', but I thought that meant it was for someone who was new to the language, not new to computers.If you know the difference between an integer and a float, save your money."
2,Down hill,"Well, I loved ultraspank. It was awesome and mainly unuiqe. When progress came out I was listening to it and The guitar remained awesome but this album has little singing. its like all screaming, and even when he comes in, his awesome uniuqe sound was lost....He was to ordinary if you know what I mean. (sounded like other bands)Ill still always love ultrspank the most :)"
2,Pretty [bad],"I dont know...A weird CD. I bought it, listened to it, and sold it. Too much influence from nu-metal and electronica. Stick to the damn genre people."
4,Spank it,"This is a great record about half the time...then a few throw away tracks come up, but overall it is a quality record that you would not be disappointed in. The Tool influence in Pete Murray's singing is very obvious as tracks like 3 and 4 demonstrate. Pete alternates between great vocal range and all out screaming, which is done in a way that fits well with the songs hard rock atmosphere. The first six songs are all great rock songs with great choruses. Tracks 7-10 (only 3 of those are actual songs) don't really flow very well and just get annoying for the most part. But 11 and 12 kick back in with the continuity and sound of the first six.The only disappointing thing about Ultraspank is that they are no longer a band...the label dropped them and they broke up. It's too bad, this record hinted at a lot of potential for the hard rocking Ultraspank boys."
5,An Instant Classic,Being a huge fan of their first album I had highly anticipated this follow up album. Boy was I not dissapointed. This album has everything you could ask for in a cd. The lyrics are masterful and the music flows from heavy and melodic with ease. I love heavy music but Ultraspank takes it to another level adding melodies and rich vocals that will just blow you away. This is one of the best all around albums made in quite some time. This band deserves a lot of credit and more recognition than they have gotten. I saw them live with The Deadlights and Coal Chamber not too long ago and if you have the chance to see this band live you must. Their live show has so much intensity you find yourself headbanging a lot harder to their music after you see them live. Go out and buy this cd right not and while you're at it pick up Substance D as well. Another great band that needs to be heard!
5,"say it with me now ""best in show""","unbelievably good! this is one of those albums where you wish there was a sixth star option.if you're familiar with ultraspank's first album you probably own it in addition to this one but if you don't own this one yet listen to the song 'sponge' off of the first album and that's close to the kind of sound you should expect for this next album.for those of you who are new or curious about ultraspank and you enjoy metal bands with a few industrial twists you will find euphoria when you listen to this. there aren't that many bands that sound too similar to this one (giving it full marks for originality) but the closest ones i can think of are Cold, Professional Murder Music, Crossbreed and maybe Orgy.anyway let me sqeeze another star in there... * there we go"
4,"Not exactly ""progress""","This CD isn't as good as their first one. That doesn't mean it isn't good at all though. It still has its hard riffs now and then. Also, ""Where"" is a pretty meaningful song, if you really listen to the lyrics. Overall this CD is very good, its on the line between 4 and 4 and a half stars. If you like their first CD, then you will PROBABLY like this one. Best songs are ""Stuck"" and ""Where""."
4,An improvement,"The Tool tribute band return but, as the title suggests, this is a big improvement over the first album. It is heavier; more varied and, even if it's not the most original album around, it shows that they have at least listened to more than one band. There is more of an industrial influence present on this album as several tracks have a Stabbing Westward and VAST feel to them. The band often get heavy as well, and have definitely listened to some Deftones and Soulfly . `Push' is the album highlight, followed by `Smile' and `Stuck'. There are a couple of tracks which make very little impression but on the whole I would recommend this to fans of Orgy/ Stabbing Westward/ VAST or those who like the Tool sound but feel they are a bit too `arty'."
4,Not Too Bad,"I'd heard of these guys for a few years through touring support or just seeing their album in stores but I never heard anything by them until recently when i picked up this album. It's a shame these guys have broken up because on the strength of this album it appears to be that these guys had some potential...think of a heavier Stabbing Westward with some really great programming...pete murray has some serious pipes that really show off on this album and his well placed screams aren't ridiculously dissonant...""click"", ""left"", and ""stuck"" are a couple of stand out tracks on the album, these cuts show the decently broad range of the band...anyway, one heck of a swan song...pick it up"
5,"Stunning, beautiful","Although, I am more of a fan of Holt's later works, I still think this work is excellent. Holt's first book of poetry shows a sensitivity and hyper-awareness of language that just becomes sharper in his second book of poetry _Memos to No One_. Although nascent, it is only so in view of his other works. A must read for anyone who enjoys beauty and language."
1,Dishes never dry!,"Yes, it is quiet., and seems to be energy efficient, but the dishes are not dry after the cycle is through. I'm not talking about a little water here.... it's as if you interrupted the operation in mid-cycle and opened to dripping, sopping wet, puddled water, dishes. Had a repair person out three times, and they insisit that this is the way it's supposed to be and is due to the new ""energy-star"" efficiency. They recommend adding 'jet-dry' and opening the door to let them air-dry for a couple of hours. (This I can not do in my tiny kitchen, because an open door blocks the way past).I have left the dishes for several days too (with the door closed), and they are just as wet as can be (a testament to the good seal, but not a help to my problem). I went online and found many similar complaints. I will try to return this. Wish me luck!"
4,Decent Selection of fasteners,"Somewhat good selection of PC fasteners. Includes 2 lengths of MoBo offset studs: 6.5 mm & 8.5 mm. The longer Studs have the inner threads a little irregular, but they start OK, just have to force the screw in a little. Maybe use a vise and make sure it works out before installing MoBo. If I didn't already have wide head MoBo screws, I would need to buy those separately or use tiny thin washers, but I bought this kit mainly for the offset studs. Would like to find packaging of exactly what you need without having to buy thumb screws in order to get offset studs. A waste. In this age of Computing, I guess it's still hard to find what you need. Go figure."
1,New Bal. 766 no no no,Do not buy this shoe I have no clue how it got a rating from Runners World Magazine ... I ran the Chicago Marathon in these shoes after wearing them during workouts for 2 months and they killed my feet while the rest of my body felt great. I do not recommend this shoe at all.
3,Poor instructions and parts,"The included instructions are incorrect as far as drill bit size. Use the recommended 3/16 and all you'll end up with is 6 beautiful holes in your walls. A much smaller bit is recommended with the included screws. Also, the anchors they provided are complete crap. Take 5 minutes, run into the hardware store and buy real anchors.Otherwise, a great product."
3,Space saver,"The containers arrived cracked. They are great space savers but do not hold much. They require frequent refilling. All in all, I am pleased with my purchase and they look great in my kitchen."
2,Too easy...should be for 5 and under!,"my son who just turned 6 finished the entire complete game in less than 2 hrs...probably in about one really! I could not believe him and made him show me and he in fact did all the characters missions and got the certificate at the end. the problem is that the two modes show you or tell you exactly what to do with in one a voice and the other a big obvious arrow.I love these guys, the Rescue Heroes and it is a big bummer that it ended up being too easy for my son. The concept was a great one...saving animals and people and Knowledge Adventure is in my opinion a very reputable company in the PC cdrom market, but this game is really made for a very young player in mind."
5,Help the Rescue Heroes - 6 year old gamer & mom,"This is a Great Game. It is very repetitious to the average gamer but to a 6 year old Rescue Hero it is filled with saving people, animals and putting out fires. I would recommend this game to any children ages 4 - 6. By age 7 children seem to want more action and more levels and not be able to complete a game in a matter of minutes."
2,Delta 23-710,"A nice adapter for the Delta 23-710 Sharpening Center. The only problem with the adapter is, you can't adjust the bevel any higher than 32 degrees. A very poor design. I wanted to sharpen my planer knives at 50 degrees and jointer knives at 45 degrees. As stated earlier, 32 degrees was as high as I could get. If you're sharpening at a bevel any lower than 32 degrees this adapter would do a nice job.I had to return the adapter to the seller since it would not do the job I expected."
4,now you're cookin' with gas!,"this album is what the ideal soundtrack to maximum overdrive by stephen king would be. the music, like a mack truck, doesn't need to be going 100 mph to leave you a mess (in a good way!). my appreciation of this album is a purely visceral reaction to the music, Tad's voice, the unreal aural assault of the instruments - it all combines to make one of my favorite albums of all time. i highly recommend keeping a close eye on your speed if you listen to this in the car!"
1,Terrible,"I received this book for free and I still think it is nearly worthless. As a chief resident in surgery I found the book to be poorly organized with minimal use as a reference tool. The format was nice, but again, not a very useful text overall."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I bought one of these kits with high expectations. However the foil on the circuit board is so thin that on three occasions it ripped away from the board when I bent a component slightly (e.g. one of the LEDs, by a few degrees, to align with the holes in the case). I've never had this experience with kits from other suppliers, so I am extremely disappointed and the whole thing has to go in the recycling and I've wasted my money."
4,vinyl gloves,"They are fine, but I meant to order the (blue) nitrite ones. My error. These seem pretty tough, and I wear them when I garden as they save my hands. I have been surprised they are that strong, and I can use them when I need fine motor skills (as opposed to regular garden gloves.) Or I wear them inside to save hands getting wet."
2,Don't like it,"I bought this about 2 weeks ago, and am looking for a replacement. It is very easy to put the caraffe in the coffee maker, and not release the coffee from the filter. The result is an overflow, and a big mess. This has happened to me twice in two weeks. Also, I don't like the fact that there is no warming plate. After brewing, the thermal caraffe is supposed to keep the coffee hot for hours. Maybe one hour max. I would have liked to have a warming plate as well. On the good side, it does brew quickly, and has easy to use controls. Too many headaches for me, though."
3,Strange Short Stories,"This is a book of odd little tales written with a western ""flair"". The line drawings are nice but the stories were occasionally a bit hokey for my taste. Good for those who like old westerns and beans from a can on the grill."
5,It Shan't be Free for Long!,Great story & even better writing!The language was a bit stilted for me at first.It was kind of like when I started reading Dickens for the 1st time.The language quickly grew on me as the story gained momentum.The characters are well drawn & the conflict was awesome.This could very well become a cult classic.I can't believe it was free...
4,Deceptive. In a good way,"A very deceptive book - draws you slowly in and ultimately rewards with a very neat and clean resolution. Routledge shows tremendous growth, albeit predictable. A good read."
2,Mildly entertaining with zero payoff,"This was a relatively good read for what it cost. The author's style was a little foreign for me, being that I'm American and the book is set in the UK, but I enjoyed it mostly. My problem was that the story didn't really go anywhere.Dude goes to the penal colony. Dude quickly gets indoctrinated into the culture of the colony. Dude gets sent out to test his resolve. Dude kills some guys. Dude finds another colony. They suck. Dude goes to the original. Bad stuff happens to the other people. The original colonies makes big plans that all come to fruition with no issues. The other people make big plans that fail miserably. Our dude lives happily ever after.The conflict in this book just seemed too nebulous and lacked clear movement as the climax drew near. Things are not suppose to be so easy for people as they were for our protagonist and his new family in the Penal Colony."
3,easy read,could have made the escape a little more dramatic and longer.I would read another book written by this author if he publishes one.
2,over rated,"Just finished reading this book over a 2 day span. It was not bad in the least, especially considering the price of free! But, that said, after all of the excellent reviews, I found it lacking. There were a great many words written and tangents taken, to seemingly no avail. The ending I found exceptionally anti-climatic after reading thru all of the previous pages to get there. There were no twists, no plot revelations, not much of anything. I would not read this book a second time, but, I truly think the author has great promise and will keep an eye out for further works from this individual."
4,Worth Sticking With it to the End,"Since ""Escape from New York"" is plastered on the cover as a comparison I thought this might be interesting but I didn't have high hopes. That movie is pretty cheesy but I find the idea of anarchy style prison colonies interesting. I was pleasantly surprised to find this isn't a cheesy action story with characters named Snake. The story follows Anthony Rutledge, a prisoner recently tagged as ""category Z"" that is transferred to the prison colony island of Sert off the coast of Briton.It took a few chapters for me to get hooked but I'm glad I stuck with it to the end."
2,meh...,"studiodude wrote the best review of this book imo. check it out when you can.i am glad to have downloaded this book for free. i spent the better part of reading skimming because the passages were more than a bit bogged down with descriptive text. i liked the protagonist but did not buy how he ended up where he did. the sinn fein references throw in toward the end? um, ok...O_o perhaps if i watch the movie version and then re-read the book i will develop a different/better position on what i read."
3,"Book had potential, then dragged","The worst of the worst criminals are transported to an isolated penal colony, then left virtually to fend for themselves. This book addresses the division of classes on the island, society's indifference to criminals, and man's inhumanity to man. The book started with an interesting premise and then dragged halfway through. In addition, the inmate's engineering abilities were a little over the top, and therefore not too credible."
5,The Penal Colony,"Just finished The Penal Colony. I couldn't quit reading until I fell asleep/finished it!! I thought this would be a ""man's"" book but it is an easy read except for some of the technical stuff which I skipped over. I am a 70 year old woman, I am sure you guys will love that part! I wish the last chapter would have tied up more loose ends. Like what happened to Frank anddid the men left on the island start another ship....guess I will put my own ending, Happy of course. A very good read."
4,An unusual spin,"I cant remember if I paid 99 cents or got it for free, but it was a pleasant surprise. I liked the premise and all the characters execution. I was disappointed when it ended. Believable and well written. Thought provoking about how would I respond in the same situation. No silly romance angles. I didn't give it five stars, only because it wasn't great literature, but definitely good and worth 4 1/2 if it were available."
4,A surprisingly fine thriller,"This thriller sneaks up on you. The reader is first introduced to the protagonist as he finds himself deposited on the island of Sert, somewhere off the coast of Ireland, or perhaps Great Britain, to serve a lifetime for a murder he did not commit. He is faced with a challenge in the ""wild"" with savage prisoners for a spot in The Village, a more civilized version of a prison. Much of the story takes place in the village as some of the prisoners wonder if there is a way to escape this existence.The protagonist learns a great deal about himself and about the importance of genuine human relationships. The story moves fast and is most thrilling. Caution: there is a fair amount of violence. Recommended."
4,Good Reading...,I really enjoyed this book...thought provoking....action.. really good writing...right up to the last page...I would definitely recommend this book to people who would appreciate it.
2,Interesting but .....,This is a two part small Victorian erotica work that would be what I consider just run of the mill ..... There are two parts in this book and eight chapters with each of them detailing an erotic account from Count Alexis and his general seduction of young women ....Count Alexis was the generic name given to the protagonist of this book in what are really three tales from three different men. Unless you read the prologue it would really appear that his is just one story ....Sorry not one of Blue Moon's notables ... too soft and gentle if you know what I mean ....
3,Very Pretty,"It was very pretty, the only thing was it doesnt have that lunch box latch, you know to keep it closed. But other then that, compact and beautiful."
1,"Micro-adjust guides for 14"" Jet",I went with the Micro adjust guides over the standard guides. These guide are a bear to set up. The micro adjustment knobs bind up and have way too much play. When you tighten up the bearing screws to lock it down it throws the bearings off. The whole set up is a joke and defeats the purpose of the micro adjust to begin with. Called Carter and little to no help. I am sending them back.Also purchased Carter's ultra blue tires. These tires are not wide enough to cover the width of the wheel. Where the tires are seamed together there is a defined ridge the runs across the width of the tire causing vibration in the saw. Beware they are sold individually and not in pairs for around $30 each. Go with the orange tires which cost $30 for both.
2,"Great Guides, but be careful!","Don't get these guides if you're planning on using 1/8"" blades. These guides are great for resawing and heavy cutting where you're going to use a wide blade, but you can't use thin blades on these guides, so you can forget making really tight turns (as in cutting a bandsaw box or when doing tight scrolling). Plus, the price of these guides will leave a sore spot where your wallet used to be.These are GREAT for specialized purposes where a wide blade can be used, but for general bandsaw work in a small shop where different blade widths are used commonly, I'd rather have a good set of cool blocks and pocket the difference in the cost!"
3,Coffee Table Book,"This book might get you in the mood to visit this gorgeous place, but I didn't find it to be very helpful as far as details on where to go and what to do. Probably because we're more interested in the hiking aspects as opposed to being windshield tourists."
2,Vagina = Basement,"I was grooving along pretty well with Rainbeau until she got to the Kegel Exercises and began referring to our vaginas as ""basements"". She was instructing us to squeeze tighter and tighter and so said ""Basement, First Floor, Second, Third..."" Maybe that's petty of me to get all torn up about that, but it really did ruin my yoga groove. If you're the kinda gal that has no problem with an analogy to a room under your house that stores spiders, plastic christmas trees, and various rusty tools... you'll probably really love this DVD. Really... other than that... it's very good. :)"
2,BORING!!!!,This one bored me to tears. I felt like it ws a total waste of time. The only reason I could see doing it is to relax and unwind. It just about put me to sleep!!
2,Very Basic Video,"This video is probably good for those who want a nice relaxing stretch. However, if you are looking for more of a workout going through a number of postures, this video is not for you. I got bored about halfway through and turned it off in the end. Did not provide me with a workout at all, just a good stretch."
2,boring,"this dvd did not deliver the emotional benefits or the physical benefits i wanted to obtain, it was boring and repetitive with moves that did not do a thing for me, it got two stars because the instructor was knowledgeable, yet too serios."
5,Wow!,"Wow, what a great workout! And I didn't feel like she was ever asking me to do something I couldn't do. Rainbeau uses herself and 2 models as different trimesters for you to follow. (Rainbeau is in her 2nd trimester.) The modifications are helpful and plentiful for whatever trimester you're in. It also feels like she's talking to you like a normal person, which makes a big difference in the feeling of the workout.I also am so glad that the essence of true hatha yoga is used in this video. I've tried 2 others (Shiva Rea and Dr. Christine Anderson) and I just didn't feel I was getting real hatha yoga. I appreciate that she focuses on the correct breathing techniques and how important it is listen to your body. During this workout I felt like I was working, but not past my limit. I highly recommend this video!"
5,Love this video!,"Rainbeau Mars is an excellent instructor. Following this tape/DVD is similar to attending an actual yoga class. She conveys warmth, and knowledge with her instructions. I think women of any fitness level, and at any stage in their pregnancy will benefit by practicing this workout."
4,A great pregnancy yoga choice,"This is a great video to supplement your in-studio yoga practices. She gently guides you through some great poses/positions and talks about all the adjustments that can be made as we get bigger. Personally, and only being 6 months pregnant now, I would still like something that pushes me a little bit more, but I'm sure I'll appreciate the video in full in a few weeks. For now I just pause the video and do a few more repeats of certains poses to get the workout that I want. All in all, a great video."
3,It's not the best,"I have four prenatal yoga workouts and this one is not the best. Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea is by far much better then this. However, let me clarify why. Both workouts are good and safe to do. I found Rainbeau Mars to be sweet but not soothing or spiritual. She has a high voice and talks way too much during the workout. Shiva Rea also talks a lot but it's in a soothing low voice that's not interfering. I like my yoga to be meditative and somewhat serious. Rainbeau jokes too much and I can not take her seriously as a qualified yoga instructor. Yoga Zone Pregnancy tape is okay, though Zen Mama's workout is better."
4,Very good workout,"I really enjoy this dvd. Rainbeau Mars is charmingly goofy and the workout is a good one. There is nothing in here that stresses my mind or body - I just feel good when I do it. The only problem with the dvd is that the audio track is off in the beginning which is really creepy to watch - I just avert my eyes. Otherwise, it's a good stretch with a gentle workout; highly recommended."
1,"too west coast for me, and i live in seattle, strange","i like yoga and do it weekly, but i found rainbeau to be a different breed. the workout does not seem inspired by the pregnancy, it is a traditional yoga routine with very little information to help create safety and awareness for the safety of the mom and baby to be. I didn't care for this style of yoga and don't think this is a very well thought out video routine. FitMama by Leisa Hart is so much better, weird how the names are similar."
2,"pretty weird, spacey, but nice set","i like the set of this video, but other than that, i would give it one star...the instructor Rainbow is so soft and sweet, she doesn't seem real. I am not really enjoying this video, its not as fitnessy of a yoga prego video as i'd like, it's about to be traded away."
3,It's just yoga for pregnant women,"I must not be in to yoga because I didn't care for this work out. I found all the zen, peace, and tranquility stuff to not be my cup of tea. I bought this and FitMamaLeisa Hart: FitMama - Prenatal Workoutand I much prefered the FitMama. That one was more of an aerobic workout. My obgyn had said yoga would be good for me but, since I had no physical limitations for the pregnancy, I prefered to sweat a bit more."
1,"Very bad sequence, unprofessional instructor","This is the poorest quality prenatal yoga DVD I've purchased. I did yoga for a couple of years before I got pregnant so I can compare to some good teachers. This young woman is constantly out of breath, she rushes her talking and postures as if she is late for something. It gives a very restless rhythm to the whole work out. Also her comments about anatomical and physiological processes in woman's body are either erroneous or don't make sense. And the work out itself is not well designed and doesn't engage all groups of muscles."
1,hard to follow,This DVD is very hard to follow because it is lack of flow. Not recommended if you have some experience doing yoga before getting pregnant.
5,Buy this Program!,"Really wonderful program by the ever powerful Natual Journeys! I was so very pleased with this yoga series. Great and challenging poses with modifications offered. I felt energized and refreshed. I also felt like all the right muscles were streched and worked. What a difference from any other prenatal DVD I have done. Love this session/workout. Realistic, challenging and really enjoyable. I wish I found it earlier in my pregnancy and vow to use it through the rest."
3,Choppy and very easy,"As an experienced yoga student, I have been desperately seeking a prenatal yoga routine that will be challenging but safe. This is not the one. It is really very basic and provided very little strength work or endurance training. It also seemed somewhat choppy. I would do it if I had time to kill for relaxation, but not to exercise. Any experienced yoginis out there should definitely try Dr. Christine Anderson's Dynamic Prenatal Yoga rather than this DVD."
4,Great yoga,"I also thought this was a great yoga video, very much like a class. The background music is soft and does not distract from the yoga practices. The only reason I did not give it a 5 was because of an audio technical difficulty. Rainbeau appears to have been dubbed or rather, her lips do not match the words you hear, even though she speaks English and the words are in English. It is weird. This might not bother some people, but it bothered me when I initially watched it. It seemed to me like a timing thing. Once you are doing the routine comfortably and look at the screen less, it might not be a problem. Seems like it would be easy to fix, I'm emailing the company to see what the deal is. Amazon was great about giving me a new DVD, but it did the same thing."
2,"Poor construction, not up to par","I returned this product. I own a Kreg pocket jig machine that is of very high quality, so I ordered these clamps thinking they would be the same, somewhere along the standards of a Vice Grip. Unfortunately, the clamps sent had no Kreg markings on it anywhere and were almost identical to a clamp I saw in Harbor Freight for $3.99. They were cheap and flimsy and of no use to me. I was very disappointed, hence the return."
2,This is an ECONOMY VERSION......,"This particular clamp is the ""economy version"" and is a CHEAPER ""Made in China"" version of the Kreg 'Premium' model. It DOES NOT COMPARE to the Kreg ""Premium"" model of this clamp.FYI:When you add the S&H; charges to this 'bargain price', it is actually MORE EXPENSIVE than the Kreg 'Premium' model (if you buy something else with it to get FREE SHIPPING). Obviously, another case of ""You get what you pay for."""
5,For Pocketholing!,I use this clamp with Kreg's pockethole jig and has been very useful. It has many more uses. You won't be dissappointed with this clamp. The quality of the steel is very good.
5,I finally know why I see things differently!,"If you have ADD, or someone close to you does, read this book. After I read it, I had my wife read it. Know she understands why I do the things I do. This book has been very helpful"
2,Too basic to pay for.,"I reviewed this book for an Adult ADD group I belonged to, and after reading it found that this text was painfully basic. If you are very green to ADD, pick this book up at the local library as a very light supplement to other resource materials, but do not buy it."
1,frustrating,"As the spouse of an ADD husband, I felt nothing but frustration after reading this ""Practical Help and Understanding"" book. In a nutshell it basically states that an ADD person doesn't have to do anything he/she doesn't want to. They just have to learn to say ""no, I don't want to do that."" How far is that going to go in a real-life relationship, be it social, work, or personal? And the info is at times so contradictory. For example, consider these two back-to-back contradictory sentences: On p. 113, it says, ""Do not do for the person who is not holding up his or her share of the work load. If that person's unpicked-up clothing litters your living space and causes you to feel pain, ask him to pick it up and if he doesn't, either do it yourself or pay to have it done and send him the bill.""The book does include some useful appendices. That's about it as far as I'm concerned."
3,Too soon to tell,"I purchased 4 copies of this book for my wife, who is an MFT doing psychotherapy in Sacramento. Many of her clients suffer from ADD. After receiving the copies and perusing them, she expressed her disappointment that the workbook did not adequately address the problems adults with ADHD face. Other than this she has made no comments either in praise or in criticism of it. As my title indicates, it's too soon to make an appraisal of the book's value to a therapist or an individual with ADD."
5,Good book,"The book arrived in excellent condition, the shipping time was great and I would definately order again!"
2,NOT worth the money,"I felt that the book was a bit basic for my needs ,as an A-ADD person.Much too much of the same old things.I would not ,and could not,suggest this ""self-help book"
4,L&N fans can't miss this train!,"'Louisville & Nashville Passenger Trains' by Castner, Chapman & Dorin is a must for 'Old Reliable' fans with any kind of serious interest in its passenger train operations. Whether railfan or modeller, you can't help but be impressed by the wealth of information found in the various chapters. And that doesn't include the myriad photographs depicting a huge range of the railroad's operations in both the steam and transition era. Most are, of course, black and white; but an interesting colour supplement can be found in the centre. Best of all, for those with an interest in modelling, there is a detailed section at the rear, show-casing a wide variety of largely HO models of particular L&N coach types, with brief descripions. When you consider the really informative time-line story of passenger operations on the railroad, and the comprehensive descriptions of individual train consists and coach types, this volume is almost like a time capsule. It's priceless."
3,Ariel's Crossing by Bradfor Morrow,Very hard to get into and lots of characters and places to remember. Did like the 2nd half of the book but not the first that much.I read it for my book club and it took longer to read then most books that size.
4,Terrific storytelling,"I found Ariel's Crossing difficult to put down. In fact, I skipped Morrow's reading in New York for fear of something being revealed that I had not yet learned. Not only does Morrow tell a fascinating, multi-layered story, he creates wonderful characters. I was struck with the realization mid-way through the book that I really LIKED all the characters (except David, but that is his own fault), not so common an experience. Which is not to say that they are some kind of exemplars, they are ordinary, flawed human beings who make mistakes, but grow; people who I could care about."
1,Definitely NOT the book I have been waiting for!,"If you have ever received junk mail you don't need this book. This particular books profiles typical forms of junk mail every person receives daily at home and at work. There is absoultely no creative ideas or techniques represented in the pages, rather obvious observations make up each chapter (i.e. ""Sex sells""). I have found that keeping all of the direct mail peices I receive and noting what caught my attention is cheaper, less time consuming, and more effective than this book."
2,Back in the day,"This book is quite dated now. It will help you feel nostalgic about the U.S. specific stuff you did back in 1991, but that is about all."
5,Designing Direct Mail That Sells - This Book Really Sells,"I've been involved in Direct Response Mail for many years. Sure wish I had this when I started. Would have saved me headaches, frustration and money.Now that I've learned from hard knocks, I find this book just as useful, as a reminder, as a fine tuner and as a classic illustration of right and wrong, what to do and what to avoid."
1,Open house: Closed book.,Disappointing! I purchased a number of books along the lines of this book for a reference library and this was the only one that I did not want to keep. It just seemed to miss the point. Everything in this book had been covered so much better in my other purchases. There was nothing original and inspiring that made me feel this was a book to keep. To add to my disappointment the store management equated the return of this book like requesting my money back after reading a novel and extracting the gist. They had no concept of what it means to build a reference source. It's not like seeing a bad movie and requesting a refund after sitting through it which is the way they put it to me.
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!,"This is by far one of the best cookbooks I own. My family eats salmon at least once a week so a book devotely specifically to enhance the flavors of salmon is just a lifesaver. After trying out a few of the recipes (which are all delicious and made with household ingredients), I bought the book for my father (an avid fisherman who just LOVES the recipes) and my sister (who uses the recipes on other types of fish and says they are still great). The recipes are simple yet tasty and you can modify each recipe for a smaller meal (I cook individual steaks or fillets with a different recipe for one meal depending on my family's taste). If you EVER cook fish I recommend this book. It is divided into sections for all types of cooking - appetizers, soups, one-dish meals, entrees, plank cooking, and a great section on how to prepare your fish from catching it to eating it. I can't say enough good things."
3,"One Speaker Down, One To Go...","1 of my monitors blew after 2 years. I don't like that they're only sold in pairs. They're also VERY BASS HEAVY. Mixes will lack bass if you mix with these; however I love listening to albums, movies, already polished audio through them."
3,Good...but...,"The good: They sound quite good. The bass can be a bit boomy, but still, the sound is very pleasing to me. Sounded good with music coming out or my keyboard.The Bad: I have had 2 sets of these. The first set died within days/weeks. I returned them and got another set. The left speaker died on me right after the warranty was up. :( It would come back to life periodically, but eventually died completely. They would also 'pop' anytime I turned them on. I have read of others having quality problems with them as well.So, they sound good, but can be unreliable. You can find good deals on them, but make sure you ask about warranty and repair costs, etc. They weigh a lot and are expensive to send in for repairs."
5,Great Control,"I know there are better monitors out there, but i can honestly tell you that this babies give you extreme control, smooth changes, and a excelent price.A 10 of 10"
5,How this book helped my eight year old.,"My eight year old son has a pretty hot temper and was getting in trouble at school because of it. He was also having trouble making and keeping friends. Does this sound familiar? Read on. We liked this book because he could read it himself. It also has questions as you go through to help reinforce the different concepts and apply them to your own situation. It is amusing, I colud hear my son laughing as he was reading it and he would say ""Mom come and look at this, It's really funny"". The book gives clear guidelines regarding how to 'Chill Out' which my son is beginning to use with VERY good effect. I would recommend this book to anyone with an angry child."
3,"I Wanted To Like This More, But....","This book was difficult to use with elementary age children, especially those who are K-4th grade. Some of the sarchastic humor and tongue-in-cheek humor was very tough for younger children and/or kids with lower intellectual functioning. When I tried to use this several times with kids; the concepts did not engage them and seemed to go above their heads. I would also like this book more if it was sectioned off in short activities and lessons.Although I do not have any teenage clients at this time; I imagine that this book would work very well with adolescents. I will continue to try and use this book, however. It may just be my current caseload that is not responding...."
4,My review,"I am an intensive in-home therapist who works with chldren and adolescents ages 5 - 17. A lot of my clients have anger issues and I have been using this book with those age 13 and younger. We read a page together and then talk about any of the questions that are asked and take any surveys, etc. during our sessions. This book is a great way to introduce children to the concept of CBT without using the technical CBT language. It teaches them about automatic thoughts without calling it that and is working well with ""my"" kids.I would recommend it to anyone who has a client load which includes 8 - 13 year olds dealing with anger issues.Janet A. Suffel, MA, NCC, QMHP"
1,Don't waste your money,"Fortunately, this was not a very expensive purchase, but it was a complete and total waste of money. The text is written in a dated, 1950ish tone, the illustrations are crude and it reads/looks like some ""personal hygiene"" text."
2,Rather awkward assembly...weakly constructed,"Decent fixture once completely assembled. I would say it is a little better than contractor quality, but not by much. Light weight metal parts. Be aware Assembly is required as well."
3,"Pretty, but a pain to install.","This light looks great, but was VERY difficult to install. There were no step-by-step instructions and some pieces had to be connected at specific points in the installation process, so I had to uninstall the top box several times. Also, there were pieces that should have had bolts to connect them and there weren't any in the box. I have installed lighting on my own several times before and never had trouble until this light. Also, I *had* to have someone help me hold it up while I was installing it because of the bolt situation. Now that it's up it looks beautiful, but it was certainly a hassle. At least it was only $30, which makes it slightly more worth the trouble. In that respect it is a good value for the money."
5,Great Value Lighting,"Overall, this set of lighting was a great value compared to the mark up you would pay at Home Depot, Menards, or Lowes.Very Satisfied."
4,very tight/intricate math rock,"I could do without the screaming punk vocals, but the musicianship is top notch. the instrumental grip to polish is absolutely jaw dropping. worth the price of the cd alone."
4,TRIGGER THEMES,"its a real work of art if you are into music that not everyone can like. it takes a special kind of ear to hear this and appreciate it for what it is - original, chaotic, manic, melodic,dark,and sweet. a lot of thought and time obviously went into this cd and the guys had obviously gone through a lot of changes. i loved this band...they're other two cd's are great but this one is amazing. check it out if you dare!"
1,Save your money!!,"After reading the other reviews,I made the mistake of buying it anyway.The machine is wobbly,the tool rest does not line up properly,in general its not worth the money.For what it cost with the planer accessory I shoud have just bought 8 sets of new blades.!!!"
2,A Piece of JUNK,In fareness the sharpener I have IS NOT AS PICTURED! The slide assembly appears to have been changed.On the older style there is no way to adjust the clamping slide to be in correct alignment with the grinding wheel. Additionally the pin that is used to align the slide angle WILL fall out and unless modified renders the tool USELESS. Then the plastic cap that is used to secure the flat grinding wheel WILL come off and expose a knurled brass nut that now needs a vise grip to tighten.Lastly add the vibration issue that took some time to re-balance and what you have here is a great dust collecor in the corner of your shop!
3,Vibration Fix,"I too was not happy that the unit I purchased had excessive vibration. But the price was right. So, I got out six quarters and stacked them two high and taped them to the top of the horizontal wheel. I then moved them 90 degrees and tried again. Continued until I found the spot that had the least vibration and then slightly varied the position and quantity to minimize the vibration. Then I marked the optimum position, took off the remaining quarters and weighed them on a postal scale. Then I cut off enough two to three inch lengths of lead tape to match the weight of the quarters and applied it to the bottom of the wheel(3"" of tape is about equivalent to one quarter). I purchase the lead tape from a golf store that sells it for the purpose of balancing golf clubs for optimum swing. I think it will stay in place inspite of the wet environment. Another option is to grind the heavy side of the metal plate to remove material equal to the number of quarters needed to balance the wheel."
4,WetterWashington reviews,"Looks like this unit is either right, or wrong. Mine is smak on with no issues, easiest power sharping system I have ever used.The wet wheel hones well, leaves an edge that is exactly right. When setup properly. Check the review in FWW, one of the better ""cheap"" systems out there"
1,Inadequate,"I purchased this item primarily to sharpen wood turning chisels. Impossible to use with small chisels for turning projects on a mini lathe, because the shafts are not long enough to be held by the provided tool holder. General quality is poor, and insufficiently flexible use for a variety of sharpening requirements."
1,Unworthy of the Delta Name,"I think [$$$] is a lot of money for two wheels, a bit of cast iron and a motor, so when I paid that much for the Delta Sharpening Center, I thought I was buying a good tool. Unfortunately this grinder gives very little for the money. The tool rests are nonfunctional and the wet wheel doesn't run true. The machine should be taken off the market, and all of us who have been ""taken"" by Delta given a refund."
4,What you pay for,"I've had this machine for about 2 years,and disagree with some of the other reviewers. For the cost of this machine I think it does a very good job. But keep in mind that the wet wheel is only a round wet stone tunring for you and as with ALL wet stones you must LAP this stone flat before first use and then between uses. The machine comes with a surfacing stone to get it close to flat and true, then you need to remove the stone and LAP it. You would do the same with any new sharpening stone before you put a good chisel or plane iron to it. After this setup time it will prefom very well. If this is to much maintenance for you there are other machine on the market starting at about $300. But your thinking about this one so you don't have to spend the $300. The tool holders are not graduated in any way, but a simple angle gauge is all you need. Also you need to keep holders and stone square and level."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Delta should discontinue production of this item. For sharpening, you can't get away with having sub-par tolerances. I spent hours trying to adjust this sharpener with no luck. The wheels were out of true and the tool supports were poorly designed. I eventually removed the horizontal wheel and added a buffing wheel, basically leaving me with an expensive bench grinder. I finally robbed a bank and bought a Tormek. There is absolutely no comparison. Either sharpen by hand or buy a Tormek."
1,Not the sharpest knife in the drawer...,"It is difficult to set this machine up such that you get acceptable sharpening results. The guides/supports do not offer much help in ensuring that the item being sharpened aligns with the horizontal stone. Also, you cannot set the guide low enough to match the grinding angle on short tools. And finally, the holder portion of the guide has an alignment bar that is on the wrong side of the holder since the beveled edge of a chisel will not engage with it.I own a significant number of Delta tools so I am not biased against Delta. I give this tool a strong ""DO NOT BUY"" recommendation!"
1,Not worth a cent!!,"In December of 2005 I bought the 23-710 Sharpening System and, because I was not ready to use it, I put it on a shelf in my shop. Then in March of 2006 I bought the 23-715 jointer/planer sharpener. When I tried to put the two together, the blade holder was nine degrees out of co-planer to the sharpening wheel( I measured it), and there is no adjustment. Due to Amazon's 30 day return policy, I am not able to return the faulty 23-710 grinder and, consequently, I will neither buy another Delta product nor will I buy anything from Amazon.com!! How was I to know that the grinder was faulty when I didn't have the holder to indicate the problem. Nuts!"
3,Your money your shop your tools...,"I do not have big bucks in the bank, so when I can buy a toolto help me keep my tools in shape for work I save for it. Reading thereviews I figured some old [guy] who is cheep thought he would get bybuying the low end and expect top end... I had no problemstraightening the stone for use... The first blade I sharpened I tookcare not to over do the cut and the stone soon was as even as thoseexpensive sharpeners... I bought the planer blade tool and have linedup 3 cheep old [guys] with planers to test the tool on before I try todo mine. No one is borne an expert so do not be quick to judge whatyou have not figured out how to use.. ""A hint READ themanual."" Thanks for a great deal Delta.... Bad Bob"
2,Academically sound but misses the point,"Weinstein here executes an academically well-trained description of the heavy metal genre, but in doing so agglutinates several generations of metal into one pseudo-genre which, not surprisingly, does not fit the broader conclusions academics must draw from sociological studies. This book repeats the classic error of all academics in assuming all metal is Motley Crue or derivates thereof, and consequently, the book is completely obsolete in the current time. Well-written and smoothly flowing it is an afternoon's read and provides great supporting evidence for any mainstreaming or assimilation of the heavy metal lifestyle in academia."
2,Good summary of leveraged recaps but poor on Goldman Sachs,"Read the book expecting to understand strategies and inner-workings of Goldman Sachs. Basically, the book delivered a textual orientation of leveraged recaps and take-overs in the 80's.After you learn the initial concept the book keeps repeating different recap examples.We learn nothing of the broader view that Goldman takes in the 80's primarily because the author has no intimate knowledge of the firm --- he was a consultant on a couple of vague 'projects' involving Goldman.[Reviewer has MBA in finance]"
4,Worked out well,"This comes with little tabs so you can anchor down the liner to the wire racks. I don't think they tested it to see if it actually worked. It sure didn't for me. However, the plastic sheet is strong and durable and you can cut it to size. I cut the pieces 1/2 inch shorter than the shelf, cut 1 inch squares off the corners, and used clear packing tape to anchor the plastic down so it doesn't shift. This way, the liner lies flat and It works out great!"
2,not worth buying,"This liner was very stiff and difficult to work with. There's no way to get it to lie down flat without using the tabs, and they didn't fit right on one of my 16"" shelving units. I wound up throwing the whole thing away, since I couldn't even roll it up tight enough again to put it back in the box to return it."
1,Big let down,I purchased a simular model; 4 sl toaster oven retro.It worked great with light use for 4 weeks and died.
2,"Unfortunately, no big thumbs up.","Being a native Michigander, I always enjoy supporting the fine musicians coming out of the Wolverine state (and there are plenty of good ones). However, Brandons cd is rather non-descript. Nothing too exciting, no ""singles-type"" material. Just slow singer songwriting in need of a jolt."
5,Best Supplement Ever!,"Being a health nut, I've tried many multi-vitamin supplements, and this one has proven far superior. Proof was/is in the evidence-- lost less hair every day, slept better, memory was also better and best of all as well as most noticeable, I had more energy. And, no I don't work for them nor did they pay me to say this."
4,This left definitely felt right!,John Bon Jovi reworks all of the great Bon Jovi hits with a little twist on all of them. Richie Sambora is really good playing several guitar styles and singing backup. I really enjoyed this DVD and I never really liked Bon Jovi before during all the hair music era. This small venue concert was really good.
1,not what i expected at all,"i agree 100% with Brian, I bought this for my friends birthday expecting to have a rock-n-roll jammin' good time, it's slow & just not fun at all. very disapointing & a waste of my hard-earned money!"
4,Great,"Bon Jovi were always its best playing live, so I'm having a really good time everytime I watch this DVD."
4,Great Comb,"Great Comb, well made, nice small size when folded, appears to be pretty strong. A good buy for the reasonable price."
3,I mean... it WORKS.... but leaves some desire,"So, I've got a year-old beard going on at the moment. I plan to grow it out another year or two. If you don't want to look like a homeless guy, you'll wash, and occasionally condition your bear AND brush it daily. So, I was looking for a hardcore beard comb to use on a daily basis. In fact, I keep this thing in my back pocket.It's better than the cheap little comb I WAS using, but I'm not really impressed. The first time I used it, I noticed the rivet (that acts as the hinging mechanism) started coming out and I had to push it back it. I have to push the rivet back in EVERY time I use it. And it catches my beard hair pretty often (I know it can get tangled, but this thing catches untangled hair in the hinge).Honestly I've seen another beard comb on here that doesn't fold up and I think I'll go with that one next. As for now, this thing works and I'll keep using it, but I kinda hope it breaks or I lose it so I can have a reason enough to try a better one."
4,"Loved it, lost it","This comb was great for my moustache and beard. Would work well for thinner hair on the head as well. The size and the clip allow you to fold it and store it in your coin pocket or just fiddle with it when you're bored. Fairly well polished, glides through most tangled beard hairs with ease. That said, I lost this comb and will probably order the Kent folding comb next."
3,"Good idea, but it has a problem.","I really wanted to love this game pad. It is well made and has great software to boot.However, when using my fav game Soldier of Fortune II I noticed a major problem. If you press more than 3 key's at the same time then a 4th key kicks in. This is a big problem. If you check the Belkin website under support in the FAQ's you will notice that they are aware of this problem, but they have no fix for it. It's been over 6 months from the last driver update."
1,Great product - too bad it's not compatible with Win XP!,"I really like this product, when it works. And on my Dell Inspiron 8100 it doesn't work very often. Win XP is a great operating system that is very stable unless you try to run the Nostromo software - then XP crashes, every time.Consequently I cannot load any game profiles so the Nostromo is just an attractive paper weight.Blekin recently updated the software and drivers, which I downloaded and installed but it did not help any.If you use Windows XP think twice before buying the Nostromo n50."
1,I am a Pro Gamer....,"I am a Pro Gamer, current earnings to date for the year of 2004 are $18,000. I compete in several leagues, Just recently my clan took 3rd in the CPL Extreme Summer World Championships in UT2K4, & I am currently ranked as the 7th best player in the world for FPS games (as reported by the GGL, WCG, CPL,& iON Gamers) & will be @ the WCG in San Francisco in Oct.So this is an abomination, it cannot even come close to replacing the mouse & keyboard. If you are serious about FPS games, do not waste your money!!!I does take awhile to learn, & overall you are left with something that only functions @ half the level of a keyboard. I tried hard to like this product & devoted near a month of my time mastering it. But if you need a quick reaction time, this is not the tool. May I recomend the Zboard Crossfire, besides the good old keyboard this is the only product that can compete!!!( & I belive that the Logitech Wireless Keyboard & mouse w/ fresh batteries is the best out there!)Dra8er"
3,Glad I didn't pay much for it. (2 and a half stars if I could),"Once set-up is better than using the full keyboard at times. Set-up is tricky. Trouble using with new game so just using keyboard till I want to try again. Maybe opt to by the newer version and commit to the time it takes to get set up. Problems with the software recognizing it's own profile style ,from with I made and saved in its folder, for a game I was playing. Ended up reloading the software. OK if you like toys and don't mind spending the time to set-up. Not sure I game any better with it."
3,HOHNER - Larry Adler Professional 12 harmonica (Key of C),"I bought this harmonica on a friend's recommendation who said that it was the best. When I tried it after purchasing it, I found that the harmonica is pretty airtight, but the tones were nowhere as sweet as what I have heard in the professional harmonica recordings. Moreover, the piece I received had a middle ""F"" out of tune. So, I was forced to return it. This was the first ever Hohner I purchased, and was sadly surprised to find it out of tune. I guess I will buy another Hohner harmonica, may be a 270 Super Chromonica (Key of C) or a CX-12, but only after I have tried it personally in some shop. And, I may not be buying it online, in all probability."
4,"Live at Radio City, Andre Rieu","This CD and DVD were such a wonderful addition to my collection. When Andre plays his violin, it gives me chills and tears come to my eyes. He is totalled wrapped up in his music and making it sing. He also has a sense of humor and is not hard on the eyes to look at. He seems to have an amazing repore with his orchestra and listens to suggestions the other musicians make. I wish I had been at Radio City to hear him play but the CD was the next best thing."
2,For die-hard fans of Renaissance,"This is not a CD I would play for anyone to get them interested in Renaissance or Annie Haslam. Most of the tracks sound like demos, mastered on multi-track cassettes, replete with rudimentary drum machines and tape hiss. And some of the vocal performances could have used another take, or at least a producer to say ""let's have another go at it"".The two Nevada singles represented here are NOT the original versions that were released by Polydor.If you're searching for Renaissance rarities, BMG's ""Songs from Renaissance Days"" is a much better collection."
4,"Not the best Renaissance, but well worth having","This album has some neat songs on it - and some interesting versions of old favorites. While I would agree with those folks who say this is NOT a good start for people unfamiliar with Renaissance, I would say it is a fine addition for anyone who likes Renaissance and Annie enough to want a complete collection. Yes, it would be nice if the quality was a bit better in places - but you still get Annie's magnificent voice.... which is what I came here for :)"
3,Not his best roles,"I grew to love Mr. Malakhov in ABT's Le Corsaire, Born to Be Wild and ABT mixed programs. The roles included in this DVD are not his best and a bit bland. The studio or stage where the filming was done was rather small, so you miss the expansive effect of his dancing. That being said, if you're a fan, it's worth including in your library."
1,Boots don't stay on!,"These boots are so cute, but unfortunately, the velcro is not strong enough to keep them on my daughter's feet! They come undone very easily, so I have to constantly check to see if they've fallen off! Not worth the money!!!"
2,"Cute, but they don't stay on!","I thought these were so cute that I bought them in pink and tan. I am SOOOO disappointed in these shoes! They will not stay on. I would not recommend them except to take a quick picture, because that is about all you will get out of these!"
5,Booties,I love it! My daughter loves it! I also purchased the hat...Do you have a matching jacket???
3,Tiny Tiny Tiny,"I did expect it to be a normal size. However, It's super tinyyyyyyyyyy. Also, it's a bit dirty on the tin box and I have no idea why."
4,Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"I am one of the ""fools"". Well, that's the only sympathetic group in this novel, and they are marginalized. With personal experience of a college French department where the dominant element would gladly push out that pesky language and literature and style itself The Department of Theory and Discourse, I admit that much of my delight in this satire comes from the in jokes.However, there is another dimension here that appeals to any reader interested in the task of writing fiction, which L'Heureux (how do you pronounce this happy name in American, anyway?) deconstructs even as he sends up Deconstruction. Who can resist the parallel of Olga, in her role as Author, to Mary Poppins? She alights on the scene, opens her carpetbag of tricks, manipulates her unsuspecting charges and, having changed everything, disappears into the air."
2,Handmaid of Desire leaves much to be desired,"This book does not come close to matching Russo's _The Straight Man_ or Jane Smiley's _Moo_ for wit and twists of fate regarding academia. Similarly, Carolyn Heilbrun's Amanda Cross mystery series presents a much more well-written perspective on being a female professor. Olga does not come close to matching the description of any of the colleagues I have met in over 20 years as an academic.I thoroughly enjoy any fiction which portrays professors with immense egos finally ""getting their come-uppance"" but read any other fiction about academe before spending time on this book."
4,lovely reading,"the reading is quick and enjoyable. However, there are things that remain unclear and need explaination. Such as, who Olga really is and why only a certain group of people could be part of ""it."" Why couldn't Daryl be part of ""it"" and why were some people more important than others in her eyes? I enjoyed the book, no doubt, but i need more clarification."
1,Dumb and Self Serving,"Handmaid of Desire is a ridiculous tale of lust, greed, and murder set in the Ivory Towers of Northern California academia. It is light reading, and unwittingly, the author gives support to those who criticize ""English"" as a useless university major and department. This book seems like it was written for the author and his friends as an inside joke--""Ho ho ho! That jibe at Foucault was hilarious!""The novel is centered around Professor Olga Kominska, who can read minds and knows the deepest secrets of the English professors with whom she works. She thinks her time as an invited guest professor should be spent helping the other teachers with their personal problems. I honestly can't go on reviewing something that doesn't deserve the time or space. Skip this one at all costs."
1,self-aggrandising and tedious,"Even though I read this book in a few short days I have to say it's not very good. It's entertaining I suppose, but the author is not terribly talented, and is simply re-hashing tired cliches of sex and ego in an incestuous academic setting. I would not recommend this book unless you're looking for a quick, shallow read."
2,"Only does one thing, and it doesn't even do THAT well...","(Just so you know, this is NOT a battery charger or docking station - it is just a piece of plastic to hold up your PSP at an angle).It's a nice idea - put your PSP on a lightweight plastic clip so that you can watch your movies at a nice angle. The problem is, the angle is all wrong for watching videos. About the only two products that do this well currently are the plastic Logitech case ($19, protects the PSP perfectly, and gives a great viewing angle) or the upcoming Nyko Theater Experience Case ($79, includes small speakers, two headphone jacks, and an internal battery to give you about 3 times the battery life).Go with one of the other available options. They're worth the money."
1,Not Worth The Money...,"Pretty flimsy, basically all it does is hold it up. Also the angle is too far down...."
2,it stinks,it is pointless and is not worth the ten bucks i bought it and sold it within a day. it is a piece of plastic meant to hold up your psp if this is what you want it is perfect if not it stinks!!!!
3,PSP Dock it,a decent stand which is comforting when enjoying multimedia such as music and videos and recharging your PSP but the low angle is a bit of of an anoyance
4,Perfect Angle!,Dont listen to the other people they must have a problem with their heads or necks cause the viewing angle for the PSP is perfect. I mean if your either short or tall the viewing angle is still perfect you must be dumb enough to stand while watching the movie cause thats the only explanation for not able to view it at a perfect angle.As for the docking station thing it does not charge your battery but I really dont care i mean its light weight as it is and its better that way than if it be a normal docking station.So dont listen to those people thats my opinion.
2,DeLonghi Air Products in General,"We've had the model, 250, 260 and now the 360 (as a warrantied replacement for the 260). If we weren't so desperate, we'd not have bought this product. The 1st one we ever got worked pretty well for about 3 years/hot seasons, but the 2nd, 3rd (haven't tried the 4th one yet) leaked like crazy and shut off, when as the other review said, the hose was installed as directed. If you have money to burn, this product is fine...."
3,GREAT!!!... for a little while,"I purchased 2 PAC-360 units 3 years ago when I moved to the LA area and builders there didn't seem to think it was ever going to get hot so didn't install air conditioners in most apartments within 5 miles of the beach :-P Anyway, my Pinguino units both ran loudly (I slept with earplugs), but perfectly well for the first 2 summer seasons. However, this year, one of them turns off after 10 minutes (this one's on the way to the trash bin) and the other after about 4 hours - I pray that it lasts a few more excruciatingly hot & humid summer weeks. I figure it's still cheaper than the $1000/month more I would have to pay for an air-conditioned apartment, but I think that $1200 units should at least give 4 years of service (2 months per year). Too pricey for me to do again."
5,Poor Dog Got Blown-Out Foot Pads When He Ran!!,"Our dog likes to run alongside while we pedal away on the bicycle, but after one such run, we noticed he had blown out a couple of pads on the bottom of his feet. We felt terrible about it, and immediately ordered Tuf-Foot online after reading glowing testimonies. While we waited for the product to arrive, our dog rested up. And all we can say now is: Thank You! We dab some Tuf-Foot on his pads before every run and no more problem; healthy tuff feet now, pads are in great shape. EZ to use, just be careful to put down newspaper first, as this solution does stain. Great product, great price!"
5,Helped my dog,This product helped my dogs pads heal faster. He loves to run while I ride my bike (we have a special dog leash that attaches to the bike). This helps if his pads get worn a bit faster than normal.
3,Up for Debate,"I used this on my feet for 2 months before Ranger School. Other than smelling weird and making the soles of my feet darker I'm not convinced it did anything. I didn't have ""soft"" feet to begin with so I'm not convinced either way. I might try it on my dog with the stuff I have left over."
2,tuff foot,"I bought this for my terrier mix to toughen up her feet for our winter walks. I did not notice any difference in her paw pads. I started applying this in October so that by the time winter hit, her paws would have the full benefit of the product. Her paws were still very sensitive to the cold weather and pavement. In my opinion, this product did nothing for my dogs paws."
4,for the price,"The sconce were an acceptable replacement for old brass outdoor fixtures.They are used in low traffic areas. For the price they were well worth the investment. If they do not weather well, it will not be a problem."
5,is a different and singular CD,"I love the music made by Gustavo Cerati, he is a genious for me, his music has acompained my life over years since soda stereo. He is always changing, looking for new sounds and merges, he's always in vogue. Also he is one of the few singers who involves himself in all the production of every disc, from the sound, tour production, style, design, team, ... till the clothes of all his crew.Nowdays he's terribly ill ... he's been sleeping from the past 4 months and we don't know when he's going to wake up ... the only sure thing is that his legacy will be in music history forever ... this CD is one of my fav!! it worth every penny!"
3,Heely's Gone Wrong,"The Heely's seem fine. Skate-buys, the store where the Heely's were purchased, is very hard to deal with. They don't read their email or honor their phone conversations! They don't even use decent shipping boxes. My order arrived in a cranberry juice box. I will nver purchase from them again."
2,Very light reading,"I'm sorry, but having read many mystery authors, I was disappointed at how ""light"" these stories were... Considering that the author's name is well known, I expected some brilliant sleuthing - not simplistic logic. NO suspense in this book, for sure."
3,The Lottery Winner,"As a major fan of MHC, I was rather disappointed with this book. Alvirah can get almost annoying at points in the various stories. No one has that much bad luck, or solves that many mysteries. These two characters (Alvirah and Willy) are almost like something out of a teenage novel. I buy all of her book, but received this one as a gift. I did not realize until I went to read it that it is a collection of stories, and not just one. I enjoy her novels, where the stories have a long time to unfold, much more than these short stories. Overall though, if you are a fan, you won't pass this book up. It just is not one of her best."
4,Another Thriller,"The book The Lottery winner is great. It has many different stories of Alvirah and Willy. They are the two main characters who won the lottery of forty million dollars. Alvirah and Willy are are always going on expensive trips and Alvirah gets into a lot of mischief on them. She likes to help solve murder cases and it sometimes gets her into some trouble. Her husband Willy, once a plumber, on the other hand trys to keep out of other peoples lives. His trusting personality gets him into trouble though. Alvirah and Willy are a couple who has a lot of fun and scary moments together. This book will keep you in a lot of suspense."
2,The Lottery winner,"This was one of the worst reads I have endured.Surprising for Mary higgins Clark.The characters were not believable and the clues for various crimes unfair and frequently obvious.What this book showed was superficial characters with an emphisis on wealth,cosmetic surgery and trite conversations which were simplistic and boring.I believe this book could have been read by an eight year old reader.Not that the subject was suitable or would have been of interest.It was almost insulting to be presented with such a book by a writer who has far better skills then those evidenced in this read."
5,"SIMPLE, AND WONDERFUL!!!!","I've read the stories with Alvirah and Willy and I LOVE THEM ALL!! These two people and the trouble they find themselves involved in are nothing short of WONDERFUL!. I would gladly read anything from Ms.Higgins-Clark, including the Alvirah and Willy stories."
1,One of her worst!,I have read all of Higgins Clark's book and have never been disappointed until I hit this one. The wriiting is awful. It seems as if her intent was to get a book out as soon as she could whether it was any good or not. I do not recommend this book!
5,I love it.,"I just love Dynasty and keeps getting better, all seasons have something new. Now I'm waiting for the sixth season"
5,Please! Give us more! One of the Best Shows Ever!,"I loved The Dynasty series in my college years. I was glued to it and felt I knew each character personally. Later in years, I was fortunate enough to meet most of the cast in an industry setting. My only beef is how the seasons are being issued and at such a slow pace, I have not even opened any of mine yet and I own Seasons 1 through 4. I am waiting for the release of the final 5 seasons and hoping they are not split into season volumes, as some of the earlier seasons were. Once I have the complete series, I will relish in sitting back and watching the series from beginning to end!Dynasty - Seasons 1 & 2Dynasty - Season Three, Vol. 1Dynasty: Season Three, Vol. 2Dynasty: Season Four, Vol. 1Dynasty: Season Four Vol. 2"
1,3rd season available only in two parts-released for sale 6 months apart,hopefully season 4 will be released in its entirety !!!!!!!!!!!!hopefully not a nother years wait for 4th season !!!!
2,Greedy - Don't Make Excuses,"There are plenty of shows that release an entire season at reasonable prices. I've been collecting Dallas for $30 and under for an entire season - and they WERE the ratings CHAMP - #1 for five seasons, unlike Dynasty, which only achieved that rating for one season. The marketers are being greedy, and those who feel ripped off should not buy it so as not to encourage this sort of marketing ploy in the future. We can live without the third season of Dynasty - life will go on. If we don't draw the line somewhere, we'll be forever taken to the cleaners."
1,Give Dynasty to Someone else!,"A different company could have done better with releasing Dynasty in season sets!There HAS TO BE A WAY to get Paramount to licnese Dynasty to to someone else!What we need to do, is start a petition, getting Dynasty released in complete season sets, at a cheaper price!Please have Paramount give Dynasty to someone else!"
1,What a load of crap...,"...rationalising that it costs money to transfer a TV show onto DVD etc., etc., etc., I don't see this happening with Dallas, a show that is about to be born again on DVD in its (full-length) tenth season! To the dissenters who tell us to stop whining...think about it!!! The splitting of seasons on DVD is outrageous and while I loved Dynasty, I for one won't get sucked into this!!!"
4,Kreg PRS1040,"Just put together my Kreg Precision Router Table Model PRS1040. This was a very straight forward assembly. Extremely sturdy! I put four locking casters(not included) in place of the leg leveling adjusters. No missing parts, no damage to any items. No more clamping a straight edge to a bench and then clamping my project to that.You can always come up with some ""jerry-rigged"" method to get the job done, but it is sure nice when you don't need to. Having the right tool for the job is so much easier and pleasant. I chose to buy the router table combo vs. making my own setup because I wanted to spend more time on my projects and not on making jigs/tables/setups in order to make my projects.Thank you Kreg"
1,Junk....,Got this as a gift and first time i used it i could tell i was gonna have problems with it. Worst signal i seen to this day and after month of barely use the phone went nuts and had nonstop static and i had to whack it to get it to stop and also people could hardly hear me day one with it...
2,Lots of work - little pay off,"Banville is a master technician, but it was work, plodding through the 180 pages. I had a hard time connecting to Max and his surrounding characters. I'm curious if any of his other novels are better and more engaging."
2,Great writing......about not much at all,"There is no doubt that Banville can write. But good writing in and of itself does not necessarily equal a good read. Even appreciating Banville's expert turn of phrase, I still found reading this novel somewhat of a chore. The novel is narrated by way of the thoughts of an elderly(?) man recalling significant events in his life. Unfortunately for the reader, neither the man nor his life are particularly compelling or even interesting. If a book captures my interest then I naturally want to pick it up at every opportunity and immerse myself in the story. My sole reason for continuing to pick up this book (over too long a period of time considering its length) was to finish it so I could start a new book that I would acutally enjoy."
1,Conned by Booker Prize,"Story is about Max, a middle-aged Irishman who loses his wife. He goes back to a seaside town where he spent his summer holidays as a child to cope with his grief. Narrator not likeable. Story sways back and forth in time. Story about grieving, death, love and memory but in a meandering and most confusing style. I was ""conned"" by the Booker Prize Award."
2,Unsatisfying,"The book hinted at character development to come but, with no beautiful use of language and an absence of any gripping narration, I gave up after 40 pages. I bought this on the strength of its winning the booker prize but it seems that even prize committees can make mistakes."
3,Tedium . . . . until the last 25 pages,"Wonderfully written throughout.Vivid, thoughtful, metaphoric prose. One endures this short book, even tho narrator is a curmudgeon who is just not likeable, because, well, this is the BOOKER."
1,Exquisite languor,"This is an objet de luxe. You must allow yourself the luxury of time to enjoy and savour at leisure the exquisite choice of epithets and oneiric description that makes this little masterpiece a gem. John Banville succeeds in capturing the process of ageing, the intensity of youth and the inevitability of death. His understanding of the onset of juvenile sexual awareness is sensitive and so accurate.He deals with the most important crises of life in the most sophisticated and sensitive way.It is a work that is transporting with a wealth of insight.It is a joy to come across a work of depth and perspicacityin less than 300 pages."
1,Most boring book I have ever tried to read,"OMG This book was so hard to get into. It is the only book I have never finished and I read probably a book a weak. How do books as boring as this get any kind of awards. Literary Genius or not, if it does not entertain then I am not into it. Worse than Map of the World. I actually made myself finish that one. I still have this book sitting on a shelf somewhere, maybe one day I will want to go to sleep and will not be able to so I will pick this book up again."
2,Banville beats you in the head with his vocabulary,"Yes, it's beautifully written prose. Each sentence crafted by an artist. I suppose that's the fuel behind its winning the Man Booker prize. But can you really enjoy reading it when you need to consult a dictionary for every other sentence? This book seems more like an exercise in creating ""texture"" rather than plot. I've never seen so many obscure words spread around, and for what purpose? About as much fun reading as it is to watch a modern-day spelling bee."
3,poetic prose,"Exquisitely written novel: I savoured such descriptions as 'the iron gate...rust has reduced its struts to a tremulous filigree.'The narrator slips between three time frames- the present, staying in a seaside guest house in the village where he spent his childhood summers; the recent past, living with his wife through her terminal illness.And the distant past and the summer when he met the exciting Grace family- glamorous parents and their 11 year old twins...Keep on reading; right up to the end you think nothing much is going on, but the twist comes right at the end.I can't say it's one of those books that will remain with me- it was hard to really engage with any of the characters- but Banville's poetic prose is quite out of this world."
2,Scratching my head,"For much of this book, while enjoying the line by line gems that Banville throws our way -- he does have a masterful command of language -- I was left wondering if it was all worth it.Max seems like a nobody to me. He seems like a nobody to himself. No one in the novel is the slightest interesting. What is interesting is watching how a man's thin life dissintegrates near the end (although he's not really that old). He's caught up in memories (notice how in most of his memories he rarely says anything -- but memories are like that). So Banville does take us into the psychology of a pretty boring and empty person very, very well. But, all along, except for the ending which finally involved me emotionally -- I finally cared a little bit for Max -- I was left scratching my head why Banville would ever write such a novel. Pity the people who he was modelling his story on!"
2,just floats there...,"John Banville has a great ear for prose, both his own and others (in his outstanding literary criticism). However.Humbert Humbert and Charles Kinbote SHOULD be insufferable. But they are not. Unlike Banville's narrators, who truly ARE insufferable. I did like The Untouchable. The Sea is saved somewhat by the last ten pages or so. But this (very short) book nonetheless begins to get unbearable about halfway through -- many, many descriptions of light glinting off water, many, many sinister hints and diabolical erudition from the narrator, etc., etc."
2,The Becalmed Sea,"I'm trying to get into this book, but can't seem to do it. It's very sloooow, the characters aren't particularly engaging, and the plot is banal. I'm about half-way through, but I probably won't finish."
3,"Run on sentences, 175 unknown words, interesting train of thought","I don't know if it is because the book is not in American English, or if it is because the author is from a different educational class, but there were at least 175 words in this book that I did not know, such as ziggurat, revenant, velutinous, and ichor. This detracted from the reading for me.There was also a lack of commas where they should be, creating run on sentences, often enough to be annoying to me.The most interesting part to me was the way sudden memories would intrude into the narrator's mind in the middle of another train of thought, the way that remembered images do, and the detail with which they are described.Not much to this book; not very moving emotionally."
1,eh?,"I may never read another book. Never has it taken anyone so long to never arrive anywhere. At one point I actually lost the will to live, not because I empathized with any of the characters but because I could not believe I had another 90 pages to endure. I am so glad it's all over."
2,The Sea by John Banville,"The author is great at descriptive writing, but unfortunately the story and its progress are pedestrian and uninspiring. (= I hated it!)"
1,You know a lot of really big words. So what?,"My book group selected this and, while we haven't yet discussed it, I did talk to two of our group and we found this book a very painful read. I have to admit that I stopped half way through when I talked to another reader who told me it never gets better. I really expected to like it. I was immediately grateful to have the Kindle edition because I had to look up words in the dictionary about every other page! How annoying. There wasn't one likeable person in the story, so I couldn't get emotionally connected to any of them. Then when I found out about the tragedy I realized the book was not going to have any redeeming qualities. I quit 1/2 way through."
1,Self Indulgent Male Noodling,"Admirers of the novel or movie ""Evening"" will probably love this book. For all others: BUYER BEWARE. Mr.Banville has a deserved reputation as a crafter of fine prose, and this book does not negate that reputation. What I object to is the mushy male chauvinism disguising itself as adoration of the Eternal Feminine. Unsanitary and unsavory. Yuck!"
2,Overrated and Overblown,"I enjoy novels of lyrical prose and non-linear narrative, but I can't stand this book. What many are praising as imaginative and hyper-observant I just see as contrived and distractingly metafictional. That is, I sense the author's hand in every line I read from this book. So for me, no matter how profound the author's statement, I can't enjoy the reading because it seems to me that the author wants so badly for us to know that he is being profound. For lyrical prose, I would recommend the obvious, Nabakov. For nonlinear narrative, try Amitav Ghosh's The Shadow Lines. Both authors have a far more natural and therefore enjoyable style."
3,Whose Death is it anyway?,"I read the book at a particularly dark time in life, and thus found the author's own sense of self-loathing darkness almost of comfort. I also, suffering from a chronic disease (but no death in sight) am familiar with his expertly described sensation of being alien to the person you love and care for the most: years of togetherness until ""news"" of death do us apart... But the flashbacks to his earlier love and the sense of both reverence and revilement of his dying cancerous wife left me wanting at times. I was sympathetic then at some point began to feel she needs more development in the book: how she feels, the actions she's taking against this inevitably entirely self-absorbed man. While he says as some point it was her who died, he clearly plunges into the experience as if it's his own leaving her very little breathing room and then finally, none."
3,Takes patience to read,"This is a well-written book, but it lingers too long on certain details and ideas. The characters are described in very easy-to-see terms - in other words, they are memorable and easy to visualize - but the plot plods along too slowly at times. It is taking me a long time to read this book and I am a very fast reader, as it does not compel me to pick it up."
2,"Masterfully Written, Difficult to Read","At the recommendation of a friend, and after reading the many glowing reviews of Banville's work, I ordered ""The Sea"" and eagerly awaited its arrival. When it did arrive, I hastily tore it out of the box, and headed to my favorite place to read -- the bathtub. Twenty minutes later, I had set the book aside, and just enjoyed the bath.Several times since then, I have valiantly attempted to find some sense of compassion or connection with the characters in the book, and it is impossible for me. When I say ""The Sea"" is masterfully written, I mean that the sentences are carefully constructed, and the vocabulary is rich and varied. But this is one very cold example of writing for the sake of writing, rather than to convey a moving or necessary story.I have set this book aside for more fulfilling books..."
3,"Slow reading of beautiful, slightly archaic prose","Max Morden is a not very accomplished art historian who has gone into retreat in a holiday home that he knew when he was young: the Cedars in de seaside resort Ballyless. There he contemplates several events that have changed his life: the recent loss of his beloved wife and another loss that occurred in his youth when holidaying in Ballyless. Max has all the time in the world and this becomes clear from the way in which this book is written: beautiful prose, but slightly archaic. You really have to work to read this book and in the end the outcomes are not terribly surprising. 4 stars for the prose, but 3 stars when also taking the actual story into consideration."
4,Poetry and Prose Merge In A Beautifully Written Novel,"John Banville is an enormously gifted writer of the first order. The Sea is a book that contains such lovely imagery and language that it frequently verges on poetry. A late middle aged man dealing with the loss of his wife retreats into his past and the realm of memory to deal with grief. Skillfully weaving present and past as his character relates his inner dialogue , the Sea invites the reader to slowly absorb each page and scene as the story unfolds. I agree with other reviewers that Banvillle is a writer for whom style and the moment represented in rich language is as important as plot. Nevertheless I enjoyed this book and would recommend giving it a try. Keep a dictionary handy a Banville is unafraid to use an extensive and challenging vocabulary without seeming overly pretentious."
4,Beautifully written,"I enjoyed the masterful writing, good humor, and exquisite character descriptions. However, I kept waiting for a story to develop and, in the end was not satisfied."
3,Into the deep,"His subject - deep, gut-wrenching grief - is a bit of a bummer. And not a lot happens. But John Banville certainly knows how to craft a beautiful sentence."
1,"Overwritten, sexist and dull","I would give this book zero stars if I could. The narrator is unlikeable and misogynist. His descriptions of his adult daughter I found frankly creepy. The prose is horribly overwritten - florid and clumsy, with unbelievably clunky dialogue.In general, if I buy a book on Amazon and don't care for it, I can't be bothered to return it; this particular book inspired me to pay the postage and send it back. Not recommended."
5,Read the Book; Wanted to Hear the Voice,"I liked the lyrical quality of the book so much, I also bought it in audio form so I could actually hear an Irish voice tell the story. I found that, when I read the book, there were passages that Banville wrote that were so beuatifully written that I had to close the book and think about what he had just said before continuing on. Every line written by the author (well deserving of the Man Booker Prize, I might add) is beautiful and hearing it told reinforced for me what a superb author he is.The story itself is interesting, in a subtle, way. If you like language and stories about getting older and the memories one recalls of one's youth, then this is a story that could very well interest you."
3,Nabokov? Not!!,"I was disappointed by this effort. While Banville is clearly a talented author with an ability to craft exquisite sentences, In The Sea he got caught up in the craftsmanship of his prose and forgot about things like character development and plot. His prose though beautiful was too wordy and could have stood some editing. The main character, Max Morden, was unlikable and uninteresting despite his loss and no other characters were developed. Finally, the plot itself was cliché. Indeed, Banville himself sums up the book best when he writes near the end of the book, ""And indeed nothing had happened, a momentous nothing, just another of the world's shrugs of indifference."" Nothing happens in this book and no one changes. It's literary candy without much substance. Banville was indifferent."
2,Beautiful Language but a Terrible Bore,"I agree with other reviewers in that Banville used beautiful language when writing The Sea. His descriptions of characters and setting were strong, however, the story did not keep me the least bit engaged. I didn't feel as though I knew his characters, and didn't really care where his story would lead me. This book was a completle bore until the end when a few surprises are revealed. In my opinion, a story about his days growing up near the sea would have been much more interesting."
1,Dull,Could not get past first pages! I usually read all books for my reading club but could not no matter how I tried get into this book.
3,a beautifully written yet dull memoir...,"'The Sea' by John Banville is a essentially the fictional memoir of a man recounting his life as he revisits a seaside Irish town he stayed in during his youth. His life was not cheerful, and it seems everyone he meets is unhappy too. By the end we discover a few secrets but, in general, the story has little to keep the reader engaged.Bottom line: wonderfully stitched together words does not save this book. Not recommended."
1,This Won An Award?,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book, but was sorely disappointed. Granted, the language was challenging at times (I kept a dictionary close by), but I just couldn't empathize with the main character, Max. The story dragged on. I couldn't wait to finish it (I swore I would). What a waste of time. I'll be giving this book away at the next yard sale."
1,Pass on this one.,"This book presents what is becoming the Myth of Rachel Carson. Pretty soon, she'll be like a Catholic saint -- stick a statue of her in your yard to sell your house more quickly or attract the hummingbirds or some such rot.Amy Ehrlich presents Carson's ""Silent Spring"" book as a scientific work instead of the opinion piece it was (and remains). And she bypasses any discussion of the trade-off in human lives the world has experienced as a result of Carson's environmental hysteria.50-million brown-skinned children in the developing world DEAD of malaria because Rachel Carson wrote a slick propaganda piece against DDT. But it made a white liberal American woman FEEL GOOD to ""improve"" the world, so who cares about those other mothers' dead children, right?Unacceptable."
1,Would not waste my money,"Carson is indirectly responsible for millions of preventable deaths noting ""The absence of DDT had led to the needless deaths of at over 30 million people from malaria and yellow fever in the tropics ... Most of them were helpless African children.""DDT was used with dramatic effect to shorten and prevent typhus epidemics during and after WWII when people were dusted with large amounts of it but suffered no ill effects, which is perhaps the most persuasive evidence that the chemical is harmless to humans,""This book indoctrinates children to idolize Carson and how to become liberal activists, but without telling them the lives that could have been saved by DDT.The books are pro-environmentalist propaganda."
4,Awesome,"I thoroughly enjoyed Scruggs' book. She truly possesses the gift of language. ""Claiming Kin"" is more than a found-my-roots book. Her own story -- changing her name, journeying far from her Tennessean roots and embracing a spirituality that spoke to her soul -- is just as compelling as discovering one's enslaved forebears. She interweaves all of these aspects, which lead back to her relationship with her father. The result is a gift to unborn Scrugges, as well as readers."
2,Disappointed,"This backpack is not for adults. The handle is very short, and you will have to bend in order to transport. Seller should inform buyers that this back pack is for kids or very short individuals. I am 5ft.7in and it was too short for me. In addition, it is not very comfortable carrying on back."
3,only for kids or shorter adults,"this backpack is pretty solid, but has a couple of drawbacks: i am 5' 8"" and i have to lean over a little to use the handle when rolling the bag, which kind of defeats the purpose of comfortably transporting it through the airport. it might be fine for a kid, or someone shorter than me. also, the wheels dig into my rear end when i carry it on my back - definitely not comfortable. i wish i had opted for a regular backpack."
2,Rolling Backpack,This item was needed for my son in the fifth grade. He hauls about 40 lbs. of textbooks to and from school. Needless to say he has put this item through rigorous paces. One of the legs have broken off so it will not stand on its own. Also the clear plastic has split at the end of the zipper. I would say the backpack on wheels would be more capable with not more than twenty pounds maximum.
4,not quite 100 percent,This backpack need a longer handle and bigger wheels. I'm using it for school and I have to carry a lot of books and it just don't cut it for size.
3,Working well for moderate use,"We have taken this bag on a couple long weekend air trips. Wheel use is only good for a child or short adult. Bag is sturdy enough for carryon, but I don't think it will stand up to much abuse so I wouldn't check it. No problems with security. Found it handy to be able to see where everything is. Will continue to be primarily my 6 year olds travel bag. Hope it lasts, not because it was expensive, but because I hate when things end up in the landfill."
5,Go see this Area!!!!!!!!,"The ONLY way to really appreciate this book is to SEE THIS AREA...99% of the people will never venture into the Dease Lake region or up the Stewart-Cassier Highway or fly a hele into the Grand Canyon of the Stikine...which is so really really unbelievably sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!People waste so much of their time at the Jersey Shore spending thousands for a week in filth when they could do this area for less than a trip to the beach and come home with a lifetime of memories. To anyone who has not experienced this region this book will be a very strange read indeed....BUT for those can get up off their butts, dust off their adventure side and......... get there ...this book is not only a must read but actually a return trip!!!!!!!!"
3,Avid travel reader comments:,"This book has interesting moments, but very hard to follow geographically even with the maps provided. There is plenty of interesting historical information about Indians native to Western Canada and also early settlers and their way of life. Since it is primarily a diary, no interesting plot to keep your attention. There is also a lot of info about the wildlife at that time."
5,Easy to Use,I bought two of these hand rails to help my elderly mother get in and out of the bathtub. They are so easy to install and remove and are very sturdy. The fact that they are more comfortable for the hands as opposed to horizontal side rails makes all the difference in the world. The price was also great-- almost half the cost as opposed to a local medical supply company.
5,Every Senior shouyld have one,"I bought two of these for my 83 year old dad who was having trouble getting in and out of the bathtub, which is quite high. He anchors himself with these and now has no problems bathing by humself. A lifesaver. Easy to install and quite sturdy and reasonably priced. A++++++"
1,Bob the Builder - RC Scrambler,"I have found this product to be very unreliable. The remote control unit works less than 50% of the time, even with fresh batteries. It is poorly manufactured and I am very dissatisfied with its overall quality."
5,The best book on bebop,"How wonderful that this book has finally been reissued. Snap it up before it goes out of print again!This extraordinary book was written by Dizzy Gillespie and Al Frazer about Dizzy's life as one of the creators of bebop. The main text is Dizzy in his own words, but this is interspersed with interviews from other people who were there at the time who provide their own recollections of the same incidents.This book is a unique picture into the world of jazz by one of its most flamboyant players. This book, along with the Miles Davis AutobiographyMilesand Ross Russel's book on Charlie ParkerBird Lives!: The High Life And Hard Times Of Charlie (yardbird) Parkerare essentials for any jazz lover."
5,Well worth the cost,"I actually bought these as a part of a recipe - I had never heard of them before. What a delight. The cookies are simple, yet bursting with almond taste. The packaging was sufficient as I didn't have many crumbs even after being shipped to my house. Expensive - this is not a daily treat (I'd be bankrupt within a year if it were), but I believe that on special occasions these are worth it."
1,very difficult to get a good sharpening.,"This tool is very difficult to set up to make it work. I've ruined bits with it by trying to sharpen them, and instead get wrong angles on them, and end up grinding way down. The chucks are somewhat flimsy, alignment is difficult, and results are inconsistant.It is one of the few tools I've ever bought that I would never use again.It would be better to simply buy new drill bits- I do now."
1,drill doctor is terninal,I am too cheap to buy a new drll bit when I have a perfectly good bit which is just dull. I spent the [...] for the DD500X. It looked like it would be fast and easy just like sharpening a pencil. After reading all of the directions for over an hour I realized it was a lot more than sharpening a pencil but I was ready to try it and try it and try it again. I never did get a bit that would cut. I ruined all of the bits and wore out the little grinding wheel. I threw that piece of junk across the shop and the cheap plastic exploded like a bomb. I wish I'd have just bought the new bits. I would be money ahead and wouldn't have wasted a day screwing with it.
1,Too Much Plastic,"I tried to use it. But the jaws in the chuck were broken. It turns out that the base that holds the jaws in place was plastic. The plastic was very dry and brittle! That made it fragile!I took it back where I bought it for an exchange. Before I left the store, I opened the package to examined the chuck. Same thing, cracked chuck! Then I asked for a refund.Unless the manufacturer stops using cheap plastic to hold in the jaws, I don't recommend this machine to anyone!"
3,Find someone else who owns it.,"I bought the Drill Doctor for my work. We drill everything you can imagine... wood, plastic, aluminum, all kinds of steel including spring steel and tool steel. The Doctor isn't a cure-all. For metal drilling you need a good split-point bit. The split-point function of my sharpener seems a little off-center, so I end up with a nipple in the middle of the drill bit. For regular bits it seems fine though. A buddy who bought one says his sharpener does split points just fine. Proper care and use of your drill bits is a better investment."
1,NEWS,I have used this product in the past and found it to be very useful. I'm very discouraged in hearing that the new machines will be manufactured in China. I guess this is another example of companies concerned with profit margins and not quality. I will stock up on replacement wheels now to avoid future disappointments.
1,Left-handed chuck terrible for righties....,"right-handed one terrible for lefties. As an ambidexterous person, I cannot use this product at all. Right and left thumbs down."
5,The Best Thing Since Socks!,"I ordered the tool, got it over the weekend, and spent an afternoon refurbishing a box of worn, dull and broken drill bits. Figuring the cost of new drill bits that I saved, I have literally already paid for the tool! This is a great addition to any shop that has frequent use for SHARP drill bits, and I am pleased with the ease of use and setup! I recommend this sharpener to anyone who wants to save money and time."
2,Packaging Deceiving,"This video shows clips that are from Perry's early television shows. All Black and White. 1956-1960. Only 7 of the songs are Christmas. Due to the age of the clips the quality is sometimes grainy.If you like vintage 50's tv. Then you will like this, but I was expecting the Como era depicted on the cover."
2,Not Inspiring,"I read this book for one of my elementary teaching classes. The author insinuates if you're not a minority, then you should be ashamed of your success. She discusses a class she teaches, where she helps a white female student see how unfair it is that she doesn't understand what it's like to be oppressed.I was looking for this book to suggest ways to reach all students, where all students are valued. I'll keep looking elsewhere."
2,Redundant Read,"I bought this book only because I had to for a class. It was not my cup of tea, seemed rather lackluster and repetitive."
1,Don't read it unless you'er forced to,The book is full of to many excuses for the failure of students of color. This book links academic success more to a students lack of color and gender then to a students effort. The book is more propaganda then research.
4,Not to shabby.,"If you have a lot of drywall to hang, and you need to cut the size down this is pretty handy. I had a lot of boards to hang, and for straight cuts long ways, this tool was certainly handy and pretty accurate in use and easy to use at that. If you need to cut across the four foot direction, just a simple T-square will do, but for the 8ft to 12ft direction, this is the deal. Pretty strong for that matter, the head is plastic, but not ordinary plastic. I found the conection point to be stronger than most riveted T-squares."
5,I wish I would've gotten this sooner,"If you are ripping a piece of gypsum board the long way, this is the only way to go. This tool makes the job much faster and easier, would definitely recommend."
4,works awesome,I have 3 of these on a commercial mini golf course and go cart track. They work great you will need to replace the starters and lamps every couple of years but boy does it kill bugs and mosquitoes .
4,Snap! Crackle! Pop!,"In my home, we call it the Minister of Destruction. My property backs up to a nature preserve, so you can imagine how my home is covered in bugs constantly -- mosquitoes, stink bugs, moths, etc. I then hung the device underneath my deck and within moments, SNAP! CRACKLE! POP! Its was like BBQing. A few bugs even were so large that they caused a plume of smoke. No worries though, the minister took it like a champ and kept on going.I have mounted mine sideways. This is especially useful because of the large volume of bugs. Mounting it vertically would cause me to have to empty the tray. Horizontally mounted, the bugs fall right through the mesh outer layer and onto the ground. Cleaning is non-existent.My only concern was putting taking it apart to put the mounting brackets on and then reassembling it -- hope you got some strength."
2,Does not kill mosquitoes,"Bought this to get rid of the pesky year round south fla mosquitoes. Been using it for a couple of months now. It kills everything except mosquitoes and that really sux.I'm not very impressed by the build quality either. The top plastic cover does not fit correctly and is held by a single tiny off-center screw. If you hand the unit by the provided hook, the whole weight of the unit would be on the tiny screw and I don't think it would take very long before the whole thing comes crashing down to the ground.Definitely would not recommed this unit against mosquitoes. The two stars are just because it kills everything else."
4,Another comp.,"Copied and pasted track list from another entry. Over all, decent comp. of Robin Trower. Not a bad thing if you're looking for a best of type album (personally, however, I would highly suggest picking up the King Biscuit Flower Hour album if you want a good intro to Trower).MID-PRICED COMP FEATURES TROWER'S BEST.16 TRACKS1.TWICE REMOVED FROM YESTERDAY2.CALEDONIA 3.LONG MISTY DAYS 4.SAME RAIN FALLS5.FOOL 6.FOR EARTH BELOW 7.MY LOVE (BURNING LOVE)8.I'M OUT TO GET YOU 9.IN CITY DREAMS10.IN THIS PLACE 11.BACK IT UP 12.RIVER13.SETTLING THE SCORE 14.INTO MONEY 15.WHAT IT IS 16.SAILING"
1,Defective dvd,"I love this dvd until very last song,you saw the picture,but no sound,I didn't find this out till after my 30 days,so I could notreturn it,so I ordered another one,same thing,by the way I brought both of them used from the same seller.I thought about ordering a new one fromamazon,but I 'm afraid it'll do the same thing,I beleive it's a manufacture defect"
1,Started to Crack,"like the others, i found that the board looked nice when i received it, but then after a few months, it started to crack. this is even after i maintained it regularly with mineral oil. and of course, you can't use it anymore even if the cracks are small, because the meat juices end up leaking all over your table or counter.even during the time the board was functional, the juice well wasn't deep enough with meat juices overflowing, and making it even more difficult to transfer into a container or pot to make a sauce.unfortunately, this is a terrible product, and i'm having to buy another one."
3,ok,"It held my interest enough to finish the book. I thought the some of the characters were too one sided and could have been developed a little more. Their selfishness was about all that was portrayed. One reviewer compared Beaton to Austen which was why I read this but I wonder if they actually have read Austen. The story was predictable, but still enjoyable."
2,Just not that great,Trite...obvious...poorly written. If you are planning to read this get used to the fact that this story is one dimensional..predictable..and an utter bore. The attempts at writing an Irish accent for one character were terrible...there was little to like about anyone in the story. I gave two stars instead of one because at least it had the decency to be short.
3,good but not great,a few of the tunes are tops but it's not The Killer at his best. He sounds in places like he's distracted and just going through the motions. It's worth the price used -- not new.
2,Leave well enough alone!,"Too bad they took a Really Great LP changed a lot of the music and put it on a CD. The Picture on the front is the same but the real reason as Jerry Lee explains on the original LP is that they wanted to cut a live album during this show in Bermingham Alabame.I own the original lp made in the early 60's but just looking at some of the junk thats been added like ""Me and Bobby Mcgee"", give me a break, what a waste of CD space. Jerry was going through some of his ""Lost"" years when he recorded trash like that. Find the original LP of this half baked CD and you will be much better off!"
1,crappy,"This thing sucked! The earphones ar made for them to be pulled out, and when I was trying to pull it out the earbuds snapped off. The screen protector was horrible becaus there were bubbles left, it makes your $250.00 PSP look cheap, and wheni I tokk the screen protector off it gave my PSP a scratch. The only thing that was useful is the car charger, and thats only if you travel alot. Don't buy it. if you nedd a car charger buy it seperate. Again PLEAS DON'T BUY IT!"
3,ok,This starter kit is ok. The ear phones are cool. I like them especially because the wire things don't get tangled. You pull them out and then you pull again and the wires go back inside the sort of whatever it is. The car adaptor is a must. On long car trips you can plug it in and play so your psp doesn't need to be fully charged for the trip. I didn't like the screen protecter. I couldn't figure out how to put it on. It said pull 1 inch of the backing off and apply squeegee thingamajig. I did that but the screen protector would just fall off. Maybe you were susposed to wet the squeegee but i wasn't going to take that risk. I ended up noy using he screen protecter at all. You didn't really need the earphones but i like them better than the ones that come with the psp. This kit is really just a car adaptor thing and the screen thing(but i didn't use it) since you dont need the headphones and more of a car adapter and nothing else to me.(even though i use the ear phones)
1,Not well organized,"I did not find this book helpful in the review process for internal medicine recertification. There are not clinical scenarios with questions and answers. The questions quiz only random facts, without a clinical context. There is no systematic review, it just fires random information. It might be helpful after doing a systematic review to check your knowledge base. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste time on it."
3,Numbing but becoming,Tolerable and sometimes effective slowed-and-stripped down emo balladry is still too melodically muted and repetitiously indulgent to sound like anything other than Low's retarded step cousin.
1,slow monotonous monotone and yeah bleak,well maybe i'm just not quite soooooo depressed as these guys. who wants to wait 3 seconds in between every drum beat? when it doesn't go anywhere anyway? and if there are any great melodies they're too subtle for me to discern. Try Slint instead.
1,Terrible Book,I did not like this publication. It had so much negativity. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I also would like to return it.
4,"Love the book....HATE the title, but I understood his stupid reason","The book is funny, informative and true to it's time. But, I hate the Title, and his reason for naming it that was, to me, childish defiance. But, the book is still good."
1,Don't Bother,"Since I enjoyed reading Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin and Coming of Age in Mississippi by Anne Moody, I thought I would enjoy this book. I could not have been more wrong. This book is not of an honorable struggle for civil rights, it is a portrayal of a man that lied, cheated, and complained throughout. Never once does it appear to exhibit any balance of the author's character which only leaves me to believe that this IS his unfortunate character. The purpose of this book escapes me. It can not possibly inspire or encourage and I am sorry that I helped support this book by buying it."
3,Good Natured Scold,"I read this book about forty years ago, when I was in high school. I thought Mr. Gregory was fair-minded and perceptive, and wrote with humor, warmth and good nature, even if he recommended nothing more than garden variety liberal nostrums. Gregory had an interesting point of view and was a good natured scold. I think it is rather dated, but provides a time capsule offering one thoughtful black person's point of view."
5,Very Helpful Book,I found this book to be very helpful when just starting to collect River Runt lures. Lots of pictures and discussion of what makes some lures more collectable then others. I woudl recommend this book to any beginner.
1,"This price for a 14"" piece of aluminum?","OK, it works and works well, other than the sloppy stops the Omnijig employees.But this price for a 14"" piece of machined aluminum? What does it cost Porter Cable to make this accessory? $2?PC does have to cover the development costs and should charge a premium for a jig that is somewhat of a standard in woodworking. Check out the price of the Omnijig. Trust me, you've already paid for this accomplishment when you purchased the original jig. And the design of this jig hasn't changed in years and years. PC is way behind the times.I'm thinking (hoping) that there is a special place in hell for those individuals in companies, like Porter Cable, who decide to rape their customers, who have already paid a hefty tab for the jig, when they want to purchase an accessory for that jig.And the 24"" jigs cost around $67?Shame on Porter Cable. If had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy a PC dovetail jig."
4,great tool for good price,"As a weekend warrior in the woodshop , i use and abuse tools. This tool withstood the daily rigors and made me many a box."
5,Great SLR camera at a low price,This camera offers every feature a developing photographer would want. The cannon ElanIIe is the type of camera that is easy to use and yet offers many advanced feateures. The camera is sleek looking and light. I often hike in many Ameraican national parks and I have been very happy with the photographic results of the cannon ElanIIe. The camera requires low-maintaince and is compatiable with many lenses. It may be the best overall bargain currently in an SLR camera!
3,terrorism in the holyland,"The terrorist group black October takes responsibilityfor the bombing of a US Naval base in Israel.The hero meets his previous lover and his best friendwhile covering the story for an LA newspaper.As a semi-famous best selling writer as well as reporterhe seems to have methods of getting to the truththat something was stolen under the cover of the suicide bombingattack. Finding out what that ""package' was resultsin people trying to kill him.The bottom of the mystery is interesting, butwe get the feeling he just never gets paranoid enoughto solve it without some miracle escapes?I liked the action, but I think the script hasthe Dolph Lundgren character looking like a doperight up to the end."
2,Good start gone bad,"This so-called mystery starts off well with a main character working as a detective while attempting to work as an actress. But where's the murder? Not until about page 200 of this overly long light read. And then...well I won't reveal the end. Let's just say it's not a big surprise. I grew tired of the characters and especially the main character whose personality was decidedly wobbly. Was she tough or one of those women who faint at the sight of blood? Author couldn't seem to make up her mind. Oh, well, the book is back at the library now so I can forget about it. Already did."
3,Light rainy day reading.,"This is an interesting addition to the genre. Annie McGrogan is a (seemingly reluctant) private investigator who continues to sit auditions in the hope that she will get her break in her acting career - her ""real"" job.This novel is nearly half way through before the murder of the title occurs and the author spends a lot of time discussing the acting philosophies of her fictional alter ego. While this is interesting in its own right, it tends to get in the way of the plotting and doesn't seem to have left time for more rounded characterisations. Some of the characters are very nicely drawn but others are a bit two dimensional.There is some nice humour here and also some apt social observations. The potential and talent of this author are obvious.I think the author might have to decide whether Annie is a PI or an actress - it doesn't seem that she can do both well.Nevertheless, for a light read on a rainy day you could do worse."
4,Deserves more recognition...,"I originally heard of Nina storey through one of my teachers, who is a friend of hers. I have heard her perform twice,a nd met her once, and I instantly fell in love with her voice-- it is powerful, sentsitive, and insanely talented. I have heard this CD, and think it is one of her best (that i have heard). she is really defining herself as an artist, and deserves more recognition. A favorite from this CD-- Cowboy. Favorite song of Nina's-- Down to You... although unfortunately I cannot find it on any releases...Buy this CD and find fresh talent and beautiful melodies."
1,Sometimes a very good voice in not enough ...............,"Nice voice, especially at low to mid volume, but a little too much attitude and a little too much trying to be someone she's not or someone you wouldn't like.Track 6 borrows a little too much from the Love Theme From The Godfather, and track 7 is a little too Kate Bush copycat-ish. ""And Now"" is a bit too much like a Burt Bacharach song. And ""Better Man"" sounds like a partial re-deployment of Carole King's ""A Natural Woman"". So I'm wondering about her originality.But as I said, she has a good voice which is very beguiling when she doesn't push it. ""And Now"" is a good example, but she ruins even that with the line, ""Resource your life with ingenuity"". That is a line Hal David would choke on."
4,Interesting book,"Whether you want to study handwriting analysis out of curiosity, or to impress your friends, this book provides an amazing insight in that abstract science. I analyzed my girlfriend's cursive writing using the tips it provides and she was quite impressed with the results."
4,Ambivalent,"I have to agree that this book is one of the best I have read in terms of analysis, clarity and understanding the subject matter. However there is one very important exception I take with the author regarding the analysis of the Personal Pronoun ""I"" found on page 115. The interpretation of the female and male aspects of the personal pronoun ""I"" seems to be in complete contradiction with Jane Nugent Green ""You and Your Private I"" and many other books I have read regarding the male/female components of the personal pronoun I. I tried to find an explanation for this discrepancy to no avail."
5,Great Book!!,This is a great book! It's exactly what I was expecting. A book with lots of samples of handwriting and how to tell what it all means. I would suggest this book to anyone interested in learning about handwriting.
3,A kids book,"When I got this book I was quite disappointed. The reason for this was that the book briefly went over the content. Yeah sure you can get some basic understanding of what is going on with handwriting, but i think you would need another resource to get you to any real good level.If you want to be like a palm reader, like a gimmick get this book."
5,Great knife,"Great knife, slim and has very useful tools. I love the pruning blade and saw, could do away with the punch and replace with another small blade."
4,HDMI to DVI Cable,Cables Unlimited PCM-2296-06 HDMI to DVI cable worked very well andat a great price!
5,Great for the Price,This DVI to HDMI cable is great for the price. It does everything I need it to and was super cheap. You don't need to buy the $100+ cables to get what you want. I am using this to connect my HDTV to my PC. Works like a charm. Recommended.
4,Computers and TVs,"After screwing up the shipping or lack of, I finally got the cable. I can say, it's best to know if the TV you're connecting to is compatible. My Sylvania wasn't. The one high resolution left my menu bar and task bar off the screen. Otherwise, the cable is fine."
1,Cable Stoped Working properly,After using the cable 2 weeks the cable stopped working properly. The image started to flicker and you can't move the cable. To get the image back you have mess around with the cable and get it into a position that will work. Definitely not buying from this seller or buying this cable ever again.
1,Cheap Cable,"My cable died overnight after 6 months with no warning. There are a few other reports of the same issue. Compared to other cables it's very cheap but you really do get what you pay for. For me it was a lot of hassle to determine whether the monitor, cable or video card was at fault."
5,Works as advertised,"I jumped a bit early on the HD bandwagon and got a DVI only HDTV. I only recently bought a PS3 and used the standard cable to connect games. After playing games with another user who used the HDMI connection I was wistfully thinking how I missed the chance to see the games as really meant to be. Good thing I stumbled on this Amazon link and wiki articles that said if you have DVI ports, you can use this adaptor to get the high def graphics in. The audio still had to be addressed but I used a digital line connection to get high fidelity sound. Definitely a good buy!"
1,Doesn't work in ten minutes,"I just open and plug-in. After ten minutes, my LCD showes no signal. I thought is my LCD broken but after I try to plug-in other computers and LCD Televisions, Nothing shows up. It just broke within ten minutes."
2,Watch Out!,Make sure the adapter fits your laptop. This is bigger than the typical laptops and it didn't fit my Dell Inspiron.
3,GOOD,"I LIKE IT, PLAY THE COMPUTERS GAMES WITH MY TV HD, READY FOR THE NEW GENERATION!, RESOLUTION MAX 1080i, GOOD PRODUCT"
1,Defective Cable,Be careful when purchasing this cable. I hooked it up and my tv made a horrible noise when I turned it on so I disconnected it. Thank god it didn't damage it
5,works great,connected my HD ready rear projection TV to my ps3. Audio and Video were as good as the old TV could get.
5,"Worked great, until my friend stole it.","Very nice cable with good screws and connections. I used it often, before one fateful day. My friend asked to borrow it and I never saw it again. Se la ve. I still have his copy of God of War 2 for PS2 for collateral!"
4,hdmi to dvi cable,It works as it should. nothing unexpected and nothing unexpected. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
5,Extar monitor cable,Was just what I needed and I got it really quick. Plug and play. No problems at all. Would recommend vendor.
5,Great cable,"I got this for my xbox 360 so I could play it on my led monitor and it worked great only ting that you should be aware of is that dvi doesn't support audio but there are other ways to get sound, lots of tutorials online. The picture quality if excellent, I haven't had any problems with it either its just a great product and a whole lot cheaper that going to radio shack or something like that."
1,Defective Garbage! Cables do not work!,These cables are defective and poor quality. They do not work at all. Do not buy these cables. We purchased a bulk order and all are defective.
1,Cheap crappy wires,ill put it simple connection port on cord for the dvi side is not snug i have to wiggle the wire every time to get it perfect the qaulity of picture sucks on it i bought better qaulity one from best buy for 60 bucks now im up and running and screen way better the wires what its worth crap.
2,Cable unlimited,"This cable does not give the nature color. It looked worse than my VGA cable. Sorry, I have to tell the truth."
2,Fine Picture - Broke after 6 mos.,"When the cable worked it was just fine - I guess because it's a digital signal after all. Thing is, the plastic cover of DVI side broke after about six months, and soon thereafter the cable started not working at all. Even though I gave it 2/5 stars I'm thinking about buying again just because it's so cheap."
5,Right on the mark!,When I was looking at this item I knew what I would be getting. It works great and was a great deal cheaper than Walmart and Fredmeyer's outrageously priced ones. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and suggest people who would like to connect their t.v. to their computer tower to buy this efficient cord.
4,Very Nice,These cables work. They were under $10 compared to $50 for similar cables at Radio Shack. The choice is pretty easily made.
5,GREAT! Better than the expensive ones!,Bought this to connect my Macbook Pro to an HDTV and it works flawlessly! Great value. I would never buy one of those $40+ HDMI cables now.
4,No complaints,Needed the cable to try to watch some of my itunes downloads on my flatscreen. Worked like a charm. Happy with the product and very happy with the price.
5,Unbelievable deal,"Please do not spend $50 or even over $100 for these cables somewhere else, like in big box electronics stores. One other reviewer already said it better than I ever could: it's a digital signal. And over a 6 foot length of cable, very little could go wrong and signal loss or noise is not a problem. So spend five dollars and get the same picture as your video-phile neighbor that paid hundreds."
5,Good value,The HDMI to DVI cable is inexpensive and works as expected. It is used to connect a computer with HDMI to a monitor with DVI.
5,Great display.,"Love this product. It was just what I needed for my gaming and PC needs. Great display, and nice ground cables. Recommend this to all gamers, and PC display extenders also."
1,DVI-D but NOT DUAL link,"Bought this because DVI-D but ultimately have to return it.come on people, this doesn't provide the high resolution. just a normal DVI cable, NOT Dual link"
5,Very satisfactory,"I ordered on Jan. 17th, and received the package on Jan. 21st. I got what I ordered in a timely manner from TheSmartDigital. I am very happy. Thanks! Keep the good work!"
5,happy with this cable,This cable arrived quickly and seems to be good quality. It fits well with my apple mini display port to DVI adapter.
5,Great Cable,"This cable serves its purpose and is a great deal, DO NOT buy cables from retail stores they seriously rip you off"
1,Electrical Hazard,"When I attempted to install this cable, I got electrical arcs between the plug and terminal every time. There are scorch/weld marks on the cable and rear of my television now, and turning on my tv with it installed blows a fuse every time. This cable is going straight into the trash."
1,wrong cable.I can not use it with my computer and television,I ordered a cable to connect my computer with the television and amazon sent me the wrong one. I cannot use this one.
2,Did not work for me,"I was not able to get this to work on my Mits 65' DLP TV. Not sure if it was the cable or TV -- which it could be either or both. I had a similar experience with a component video set from GameStop (store brand) for my Wii and it did not work either, but got a slightly more expensive set from Sams Club and they worked fine. I'm thinking the cheap brand cables not good with Mits TV sets. Not sure why."
2,does not work for DVI to HDMI,"I bought this cable to hook up my new HDTV (HDMI inputs) from my cable box. Unfortunately my cable box has DVI outputs (not HDMI). This cable would NOT work for a DVI to HDMI connection - I assume it would work properly for a HDMI to DVI connection although I have no way of verifying that. Note that I had been successfully utilizing this DVI output from the cable box previously (so I am sure that the problem was not with the DVI output of the cable box). Buyer beware that ""HDMI to DVI"" means just that. I have since researched other cables and noticed that some cables describe the connections as successful in either direction (""vice-versa"") and there are others that specifically say ""DVI to HDMI"". My bad, I guess!!!"
5,Works just as expected.,"I bought this cable to connect my Macbook Pro to my Sharp AQUOS HDTV and it worked perfectly. Picture is perfect, HDTV makes a great 2nd monitor, and my daughter enjoys watching Yo Gabba Gabba in iTunes on the big screen too. I only wish I had bought a slightly longer length cable so I could comfortably sit on the couch while the Macbook is connected, but that is my own fault."
4,Good cable; no sound from MacBook,This is a great cable for the price. Its flexible and works well with the MacBok mini-DVI to HDMI cable. The problem is that on a MacBook you will not get sound so watching a movie doesn't work without additional cables. This is NOT an issue specific to this cable but is MacBook problem. The image resolution on an 780p LCD screen is great.
5,Great value,"I ordered this product because I've had great experiences with generic cables. This is no exception. The cable works great and I was easily able to connect my DVI video card on my computer to my HDTV's HDMI port. The only downside is that I had to connect directly to my TV instead of through my A/V receiver because it had a connection issue there, but that wasn't a big deal to me."
1,Dead after only 2 weeks,"This cable worked wonderfully for two weeks, then it stopped working. I thought it was the cable box from my cable company. Replaced the box, same problem."
5,hits the spot,"Comparatively wonderful price for an adapter cable to go from HDMI (blue-ray player) to an older TV with a DVI-D input. Other places had items like these for over $50, so under $10 was a great deal."
3,Nice,Get this to use for my HDTV going from the DVI on my computer. It would work but the HDTV does not read the resolution right so the image is either to small or to big.
5,Great product,I Bought this DVI-to HDMI cord to connect my PS3 to my Acer P221W computer monitor. It works Great and the only thing that I had to do was set up the resoloution in the PS3's setup on the XMB. Cool
4,Works but HDMI connection sticks out far,This is a good standard HDMI to DVI cable but I wanted to point out that if your TV is mounted it might not be a good choice. The base of the HDMI connection sticks out farther than other cables I've used (like Amazon Basics) and it doesn't fit in the space between my TV and wall mount; It sticks out too far and hits the wall mount. I am used to the Amazon basics HDMI to DVI cables so in comparison this cable is much thinner and more flexible if that matters to you.
1,No good,Doesn't work! Put it on my system and tried everything possible to no avail. Don't waste your money. Buy quality not price
4,Excellent quality for the price,"I cannot find a single complaint about this cable. It does exactly what I purchased it for and it does it well. I am currently using it to connect one of my PCs running a DVI video card through my HDMI plasma screen at 1280x720 res and it looks beautiful. Cable length is great and no issues with loose connections on either end. Only reason I did not give this item five stars is because I am sure there are higher quality cables out there, but that does not mean this cable won't suit your needs."
5,Great cable. Does the job.,"I purchased this cable to connect my Macbook Pro (10.5.5) to my HDTV via HDMI. It worked perfectly, and the quality was great. I was also pleasantly surprised how well my Mac was mirrored on my HDTV. Couldn't be happier."
4,Fresh take on a much used Idea,"Wakewood was a delightful surprise for me.It was not original but the cinematography,acting and feel of the film made it seem fresh.It got straight to the point and went to the guts from there.There was quite a bit of blood and some gore which I didn't expect but loved.it was very well cast and it really did have that old Hammer feel to it.The story was well crafted and executed and the only thing I can say as a minor negative would be that there is no explanation given as to why, how or when Wakewood came to be.I was very intrigued and satisfied with this endeavor and highly recommend it."
4,wake wood,"Another film about a child dying and being bought back to life.. but this was a good one. The child gets killed by a dog, the mom and dad move to a little town and discover the town's secret.. that they can bring the dead back to life for two or three days... they bring back the girl, they love her and can't part with her, and they can't leave the town with her either, that new. But of course, the child seems to have a flaw like always... because the parents lied though, so it's there fault. but people die and you can see how it's going to end yet the ending was good, the whole movie was enjoyable, i enjoyed the acting and the little girl was creepy, i got freaked out during a scene or two.. so check it out!"
3,Could've been better,Movie wasn't realistic on peoples behavior. But storyline was ok and different. bloody scenes and some suspense moments. Not worth $4 bucks.
5,Great Movie!!,"I am very picky about the indie horror films that i watch,this one being the first Hammer movie I've seen, is one of the bestexamples of filmmaking today, even tho there have been dozens of otherfilms made about that kind of scenario...this is terrific."
3,Wake Wood aka Irish Pet Cemetary,"Wake Wood was ok. Predictable, but well paced with a decent script and good acting. Its neither gory, nor violent and could have used some cheap scares (which there were plenty of opportunities). For horror fans it is worth a view. It definately would appeal more to the slow paced creepy atmospheric fans than blood and guts fans.Some advice...even though the movie is in english, we had to put on the subtitles as the Irish accents were so thick in places it was tough to understand at times"
2,Not a good new path for Hammer,"I can't believe Hammer is trying to be like the shock and gore movies coming out these days. The opening scene of this movie was despicable. Whoever thought it would be OK to present such imagery in a film is truly disturbed. Hammer is supposed to be about gothic horror. That is something there is a big void in nowadays and they are in a good position to make movies exactly like what they used to make. Hollywood started making Hammer style films in the 1970s and that is why they quit in the first place. I thought Hammer recognized this and was resuming from where they left off, but no. If this is what they are going to be involved with maybe they should just go back into retirement so as to not spoil their reputation."
5,Simply the Best,"Simply the BEST describes this DVD and Trace Adkins in general. His music, voice and videos are the BEST around and his concerts can't be beat. This is a long awaited arrival and I look forward to many more VOLUMES of his videos and music.Do not hesitate to purchase this DVD... you will not be sorry."
5,Oh Happy Days!,"How we all have been waiting patiently for this DVD to be made. Trace is one of the most talented performers out there. He deserves all the good things life has to offer.I have ALL of his C.D.s that are practically worn out that's how much I love him and his music. So, I'm going to order quite of few of these DVDs for back ups. That way I can see him perform in my own living room when I can't make it to his shows.Thanks for listening to us Capitol! And THANK YOU Trace for ALL the happiness you have brought to us!"
4,FINALLY!,"Great collection of videos!Too bad it missed some other Excellent videos. But again for the price it included an excellent # of songs. I hope there is a part 2 for the hit videos. Boy I need to see ""Don't Lie"".Nawaf"
5,AWESOME!,"I believe this is the greatest video DVD ever produced. Trace is HOT in the video as he always is. This video will be a sold out item for sure. As good as this is, there will surely be more to follow. This DVD is definately AWESOME!!!!! What women wouldn't want to have this in their collection. After you watch this video, You'll Wanna!!!"
3,Trace Adkins - video hits DVD,"I hate it when a singer makes a greatest video hits collection and they don't put all there videos. The following two videos should have been on this dvd: Lonely Won't Leave Me Alone andHelp Me Understand. Since they put ""Hot Mama"" on there, they should have also put ""Rough And Ready"" as well. So, I gave this dvd three stars.-Rick-"
4,"Satisfied, but left wanting more...","I'm from a small town, and didn't have CMT back when some of the older videos on this DVD were released, so it was great to finally be able to see Trace Adkins pre 'Hot Mama' and 'Chrome'. I love the fact that I can watch the videos anytime I want, and I truely do like all the videos that are included, but I'm with one of the other reviewers in that I'd have liked to have seen some of his other albums represented. That said, I know that I (along with many other fans), will surely be waiting for the Video Hits II collection."
4,"Trace Adkins mini videos DVD, low price, good time.","This DVD is a bargain at such a low price, providing a handful of videos from Trace Adkins, every fans of which will love this DVD as a gift or something like that. You can't go wrong with this videos collection DVD if you like Trace. The pictures are sharp, colorful, and the sound is crystal clear, simple but efficient and providing a good time to the fan."
5,I love it...,"I love this video selection of Trace Adkins videos. It great to see some of his older stuff and be reminded about how great he really is, even tough he gets over looked sometimes. My favorite has to be ""Every Ligt In the House"""
2,Driving in Diverse Mild !,"The book Driving in Diverse would serve well for newer fans of Jethro Tull. Barbara Espinosa is enthusiastic in her collection of facts, tidbits and interviews regarding all things Tull! I would rate Greg Russo's Jethro Tull Reference Manual a more complete reading of Jethro Tull and Dave Rees, Minstrels in the Gallery a close second. Driving Diverse is a good companion to the Jethro Tull stories in print."
3,Ian Anderson review,"""Barbara Espinoza wrote to me to ask for interviews and contacts for a proposed book. She managed the unthinkable: an interview with the reclusive hermit, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond! Jeffrey offered up some Driving In Diverse: A Collective Profile Espinoza Driving in Diverse thoughts on his life and work, which he wouldn't ordinarily share with me - and I see him every few months for lunch or dinner. What a treat to see this in print. He probably made most of it up `though.Barbara needs a little help on the proof-reading front - a lot of typos and grammatical no-no's here, but still a good read. Published in 1999, her book is curiously named ""Driving In Diverse."" -IAN ANDERSON"
4,Read it for the afterword,"The other reviews here give a fair summary of the book, even the doubters and those obviously less than pleased. Yes, she drops names. (I didn't see this as much of a drawback - it was like sitting at a friend's family reunion and hearing people discuss long-lost cousins. The names don't mean much to you, but it means something to the family.)But did you read the afterword, I want to ask the other reviewers. The heart-breaking account of her brother's death, of realizing that time had moved on for others while she was still trapped like a ghost in the family home, reliving the abuse and neglect she and her brothers and sisters experienced. Did you read about her life after the book was published, the hunger to make a connection?This, I think, is the truest part of the book, the most open and honest. This is worth all the pages that went before."
2,More of an Excuse than a Memoir,"I did not like this book. It is a memoir that is more like a catharsis and 'atta girl in order to make excuses for a fairly valueless and vapid life.Fueled by the Womens' Movement, Ms. O'Faolain justifies her short-lived, alcohol-entrenched or extra-marital liaisons with no remorse. She claims that if her lovers are married, it's their wives' problem (and this from a soon-to-be feminist!?). She is also a name dropper of all manner of literati with some anti-semitic descriptions thrown in.Finally, we look at the terrible neglect and abuse from her childhood with narrow-visioned denial. She demonstrates this same denial when she minimizes the domestic violence in her relationships.I have to wonder if she's ever done deep reflection or if she has any capacity to put herself in someone else's shoes.Not recommended."
5,An honest and deeply moving memoir,My sister lent me this book and I found it a wonderful read. I did not want the book to end. Her search for love and her looking at that search in such honest ways has made me feel that solitude is a common human experience even though we may not talk from it all that much. I am so grateful to Ms. O'Faolain for writing from her heart and sharing it with so many.
2,Boring Memoir,"I found this book to be really boring. I initially really enjoyed the first few pages, but the author jumped around so much, I found the book confusing. She would start talking about something from her past, switch to some other point in time, and than jump back. It was only a little over 200 pages, but felt like it was 800 pages. By the end of this memoir I found the author downright irritating in her lack of self-esteem. I wanted to yell at her to get a hobby & stop whining. I realize she has been through some very very hard times in a dysfunctional family, and there are moments of clarity where I found the writing style quite fluid and beautiful. However, this book couldn't end soon enough for me."
2,Huh?,"Boy, when I picked this one up I didn't know that 215 pages later I'd actually believe it must have been ""accidental"". To echo the herd, McCourt got it right and O'Faolain just plain didn't...If you were drawn to this because you loved ""Angela's Ashes"",try Rick Bragg's ""All Over but the Shoutin'"" for another poignant memoir."
2,"Boring, Hard to Keep the Thread","I found the parts about her family most interesting, and also depressing. Her alcholic mother and wayward father made for a sad upbringing. After about page 80, I scanned the rest of the book."
1,I gave on this book...,"after only 58 pages. Pointless, ponderous, self-indulgent, meandering...yawn.I deliberately stayed away from the reviews before picking this book up, but I could have co-written most of the ""disappointed"" ones.There are too many good books available to waste my time on this one."
1,is she really honest?,"Nuala writes on about the poverty of her life a la Frank Mccourt, yet her father had a solidly middle class profession as a news reporter. In fact, she admits that another writer ""outs"" her as quite middle class, and others refer to her family as ""bohemian,"" not poor. She went to a boarding school-hardly a solution for a truly impoverished family. Her memoir would have been more poweful had she focused on what appears to be the more central problem in her family - alchoholism, and the ensuing emotional impoverishment that is the inevitable result. If I were to right a memoir as a 53 year old woman, I can't imagine that my sexual escapades would continue to be such a central part of my lifestory. I thought her continuing preoccupation with men and sex was immature, odd, or somehow disfunctional. Overall, she comes across as a very depressed woman. Very sad personal story."
2,What's all the fuss.,"I heard an interview with the author and decided she was quite an interesting individual. Although this book has received many over-the-top reviews, I was disappointed. The book has sections which are long lists of people she met, worked with, or admired. But often she provides no information about the individual. She clearly accomplished a great deal but how? There is a tone of self-pity throughout the text and she seems loathe to give people, including herself, credit for their achievements. Very Irish that way."
1,We paid to be her therapist.,"Our book club read this book after hearing that it was so highly recommended. Though the author got her literary act together in the second half of the book and there were a scattering of beautifully written passages, we were not impressed. Here's our review: The idiosyncratic, disjointed ramblings of a self-absorbed woman looking to the public for the attention and love she never received from her parents. Tedious to read and lacking in any insight on the part of the author."
1,Why can't we vote with negative stars?,Quite possibly the oddest mixture of self pity and self promotion that it's ever been my misfortune to read. Here's a quick tip for Nuala - being screwed up doesn't make you deep and mysterious. Or even interesting.
1,Flat and boring,"I can't understand how this became a bestseller. It is not much of a memoir, but mostly a tiresome, pointless, self-serving account of the odds and ends of life; and the style is not strong enough to carry the weak material."
1,McCort did in better in Angela's Ashes,I wanted to like this book but found it depressing and uninsightful. Angela's Ashes is the best of this genre. Her newspaper columns must be better. I had to force myself to finish it.
2,I am confused by the accolades this book received,"Though this book didn't inspire a passionate response from me (I thought it was fine, at best) I am stunned by the unanimous raves it has received. I like the person, Nuala, very much, but as far as the literary attributes of the piece, this is no ""Angela's Ashes."" There is no comparison between this work and any great intensely rich autobiography. Unfortunately, because I wanted to love it, I must lump this book with other reading 'lite' and suggest that it would be good summer beach fare or for a plane trip. It requires very little attention and contemplation to breeze through the passages. I know I am practically alone in my opinion, but as a seasoned reader I would suggest that if reading is your most beloved pastime this will probably disappoint."
3,It was ok,I wished Are You Somebody would have had a much clearer feminist autobiographical voice. I think O'Faolian's writing was too choppy and I couldn't keep up with her thoughts on Bob. She jumped around and was vague in some parts. It might have been helpful if I knew what some of the geographical places were that she mentioned. I was hoping for more of a personal account of how she felt with the love affairs and what her thoughts on love and life were. I think it would be hard to write a biography on here because there are not many secondary sources available~ that is not helpful for my assignment in college.
1,Pretentious and self-pitying,"I read this for a book club and not a SINGLE person in our group liked this pretentious, self-pitying woman who can't write. We didn't like her book either!"
2,Whingings of a WestBrit wannabe,"Just another long winded whinge about the 'sins of our fathers'(and mothers). I'll give it 2 stars for the occasional artful turn of a phrase but there is no great read here. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on a Dilbert cartoon book, or the like."
1,Don't bother!,"This book came highly recommended to me since I seem to be drawn to Irish authors. Although I kept reading because I was waiting for the book to get better,I finally just gave up and quit! The author seemed to define herself by who she slept with. I was completely disappointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone!"
2,Are You Somebody,"This book has a good start and that's all it has. Considering the author has won a few scholarships and has met many distinguished writers, critics, poets, and scholars, her writing does not meet the expectation built up in a reader's mind. The book consists of a lot of name droppings but with no elaboration on any of the work of the famous people that crossed her path. Maybe it is supposed to be a reflection of the general drunken incoherent state of Ireland and the helplessness of the Irish people. It is very sad indeed. There are many other worthwhile books to read than this one."
2,Need a Broom to Sweep up all the Names Dropped,"Being ""one generation off the Bog"", I purchased this book with some anticipation of delight. Unfortunately I found none. I found the book rambling, boring and fragmented. O'Faolain touches on her family's issues and relationship strains but fails to make them interesting enough to care about. She touches on her challenges as a female professional in modern day Ireland but fails to delve deeply enough for the reader to draw any conclusion. She bounces around the father-daughter conflict but so tepidly it made me think she was afraid to hurt his feelings. Each issue or topic she touched, she did so lightly, leaving the reader without anything to chew on.She occassionally has writing great moments, making it clear her writing is far superior to what she presents in this book. I am disappointed she didn't treat us to more of it."
2,Dull and depressing,"Memoirs of more or less ""ordinary"" people can be interesting and involving as Frank McCourt, Rick Bragg and Russell Baker, among others, have proven.(I wish I could think of some women to add to this list). But simply naming obscure Irish poets and writers without fleshing them out for the reader leads to an attitude of ""who cares?"". There was not a single character in this book who was not a victim, predator, petty, repressed, deluded, or in some other way unlikeable. Unfortunately, this includes the author. I give an extra star for the occasional beautifully written passage; I wish there were more of them."
1,Completely disappointing,"For all her laundry lists of books she has read and famous people with whom she has hobnobbed, the author's own writing is sadly lacking in insight. I might have enjoyed reading her newspaper columns much more, but none were included here. I found the tale of her youth and schooling vague, disjointed, and scattered. A professional critic might use words like ""undeveloped"" and ""immature."" Sorry, I just can't understand all the hype about this book. Readers would do better to return to Joyce's ""Dubliners."""
1,Hard to get through...,"I found this book's subject matter to be interesting (growing up in Ireland, growing up in general) but I found the narrative disjointed. A tracable story line, connectedness for characters throughout the book and explanatory notes on just who some people and what some places are (I'm sure I'm not the only one who didn't know) would have helped this book a great deal. I think that the author is a good WRITER...but the book to big, sprawling and disconnected."
3,a never-ending train wreck,"Nuala O'Faolain's book is elegantly written, but sometimes it got so depressing that I wondered if I wanted to keep reading.Her emotional life seems to be a never-ending train wreck, as she hopelessly pursues one man after another.I wondered if she was any better off than the mother she so pitied, neglected by her husband, looking after ten kids, and sitting at home all day reading and drinking."
2,Very disappointing,"After being completely charmed by 'Are you Somebody?"" I was expecting at least a well-written decent read. Instead this book was disjointed, rambling, went into highly irrelevant personal details, and didn't seem to have much of a point."
4,"the struggle to overcome pain, find love and meaningful work","This is a splendidly written autobiography, unbelievably rich in detail and raw emotion. While other reviewers have ably described her life's journey - from a chaotic household with alcoholic parents to a very good job as TV producer and then columnist - this is also a beautiful and vivid evocation of a changing Ireland. O'Faolain provides the grittiest of portraits, of a stalled society that is emerging from centuries of repression and excessive religiosity to a modern society. She herself embodies much of it, journeying (across class lines) from desperate loneliness (seeking love as a panacea) to a self-empowered feminist writer who has the strength to keep going. It is deep and gets you to reflect on your own predicament, particularly middle age.Warmly recommended."
4,Read this one with an open mind,"It isn't very often that such honesty about oneself appears in print. As someone studying the lived experience of middle-aged women living alone, I found this book engaging and enlightening, particularly the final chapters. I admire the courage it took to share so much about herself with such an enormous audience. If you are uncomfortable with stories that detail someone's journeys and struggles through life, take a pass on O'Failon's story. This is a must read for anyone who cares about women in midlife. Brava, Ms O'Failon!"
3,Name dropping spinster tugs the heartstrings.,"How to reveal onself without revealing much at all? The author answers this question in this ""accidental"" autobiography. She gives the reader glimpses of personal despair, rage at patriarchy, lesbianism, British and Irish literary life, and her life's struggles. But these glimpses, these morsels, are but a smorgasbord of appetizers. Perhaps they are all a conservative Irish reading public can stomach .But a multi-cultural readership steeped in therapeutic confessionals hungers for more. The nearly ceaseless listing of encounters with the great, near-great, and obscure in the world of letters detracted from the emotional power of the memoir. Most moving was the fearless description of loneliness in the final chapter. Without it and the epilogue, the author and her world are only seen timidly shrouded in Irish Mist, alcohol pun fully intended."
2,what a disappointment,"I love biographies and memoirs, but barely made it through this one. Most annoying was the incessant name-dropping of Irish literati, most of whom were unknown to me. But more than that, I felt like, ""why is this woman writing a memoir?"" ""What has she accomplished?"" Her major accomplishment seems to have been avoiding the trap of early marriage and a suffocatingly large family that sucked the life out of so many women of her generation and culture. However, the book leaves the reader to believe that she escaped largely by chance, through a failure to get pregnant despite years of unprotected sex and binge drinking. It was disheartening to see her very immature relationships with men, even into her later years. We are left thinking ""Has she learned nothing?"" I will say the book's honesty is a strong point, but I was left mystified as to why it was apparently such a cause clebre in Ireland. A major disappointment."
4,Decent Account of a Woman's Life,"I heard Nuala O'Faolain interviewed on my local NPR station.I was enthralled by her calm demeanor and wanted to hear more about her journey through her life.My experience reading her book didn't quite come up to my expectations. I realise that many readers were looking for a woman's version of Angela's Ashes--I was looking for an Irish Maya Angelou. Maybe if I had read the book without placing such expectations on it, I may have gotten more from it. Maybe just enjoyed it for what it is: a woman's (intensely) personal story."
3,much ado about nuala,"I enjoyed reading this although I found it disjointed as other reviewers have noted. The book is not really a memoir (guess that's what Nuala means by accidental). In fact, I'm hard-pressed to say what this book IS or what it is about. It's a string of events and musings, sort of a highly erudite journal. It is compelling in the way listening to a very smart friend can be compelling. The end becomes much more personal and intimate than the rest of the book.One question: Who is the woman on the cover? Is it Nuala? In what year? I couldn't find a photo credit or caption."
2,Disappointed,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the work is tedious and the constant namedropping is a major distraction. I too had high hopes for this book, but can't say that I am enriched in any way by having read it. All in all, a huge disappointment."
2,This basket sucks - but not how it should!,"The bottom line: This product doesn't do what it says it does.I placed a medium bottle of shampoo (<16 oz.) and my facial cleanser in the basket and firmly stuck it to my shower wall. It held for the shower, but every time I come back to maintain my daily hygenial duties, I have to stick it up again. I would not recommend this to a friend and I would probably still feel guilty recommending it to an enemy."
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"Well, this works fine for me! It's nice and cheap and I can tell that the sturdy plastic will last me a while and won't rust up."
3,Motorola battery -- go for the extended,"I got this battery after not being satisfied with a non-Motorola brand that I thought would save me money. That one barely made it through a day without needing a charge. I find that this one is no better. I charge the phone overnight, take it to work with me, and have to put it on the charger at work in order to have power for the trip home. I can't imagine how it would last if I had figured out how to use the MP3 player feature on this **&* 'smart' phone."
2,Average at best,"This is the second replacement battery I've purchased. I never get through the whole day, and often only get about 6 hours. This is after an all night recharge. I have an older phone and still looking for a good replacement until I get another phone. Use it as a backup only. The best thing about the battery was the price. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Motorola Ion battery for Motorola Q,"The battery does not have any better charge than the battery I have had for about a year. I was not impressed, but then again you get what you pay for."
2,Extremely Inconsistent,"This book was a mixed bag for me. At times, the author was able to create some surprisingly engaging and witty dialogue between the characters. And at other times...well, the language was so insipid and contrived that I couldn't quite believe it was written by the same person. Furthermore, there is absolutely no logic affirming any of the main character's actions. Everything (especially how they ""fall in love"") sort of ""just happens"" as if it were a miraculous occurrence. No explanation (at least no plausible one) is offered. We are left assuming and guessing about what happened behind the scenes, which is an absolutely dreadful literary conceit for this genre. Romance novels, as they are, are already absurd (it's what makes them fun). Samantha James didn't even bother trying to address these logical fallacies. Incredibly frustrating albeit brief read."
2,"Sometimes entertaining, sometimes embarrasing.","Both this book and its companion, The Perfect Groom, require a little more work. Plots are a bit far-fetched. Heroines could be a little more profound (I'd settle for less silly). Problems and behaviors are excused and explained with psycho-babble and too neatly and predictably resolved.I've liked some Samantha James books in the past and had her on my list of authors to buy (no longer). I bought both books at the same time, was relieved to finish Perfect Bride and have been stuck in Perfect Groom for days and don't look forward to picking it up. No way, I'll buy the story of the third sibling!"
2,so so romance novel,I was really disappointed with this book- it got great reviews so I was excited to read it- but it was just lame. It was interesting in the beginning but nothing really happens until the end- even the end was predictable. I much prefer Judith Mcnaught historical novels.
3,A light but predictable romance,I loved One Moonlite Night which was the first Samantha James book that I had read. The Perfect Bride did not measure up to my expectations. I was a basic rags to riches story. Poor girl is saved by rich man. Rich man is attracted to poor girl. He educates her and they fall into lust/love. He breaks her heart and has to work hard to regain her trust.I really didn't enjoy this book too much. I was really predictable. It took me a few days to finsih it. I usually read a good story in 1-2 days.The story wasn't poorly written but it lacked that magic that One Moonlite Night had. The characters were not that compelling and I didn't have that I can't wait to see what happens next feeling.Sensuality rating 3 out of 5
3,It was OK,"I've been reading romance novels for years, good and bad. While this is definately NOT the worst, I still couldn't get the characters to pop out of the book. The characters felt hollow and it didn't leave the warm-fuzzy feeling I love as I finish a novel. I've read alot of positive remarks here and I believe that you should give this book a chance. You may have a whole different opinion as I do. And if the author's job was to ""touch"" people with the storyline, then she definately succeeded. :)"
2,Hollow repetitions,"2 1/2Pretty unnecessary for anyone but the most devoted to all things ""slow-core""- they sound similar to a second rate Idaho, with more distortion used to drown out less melody. The band's attempt at entrancing through underwhelming, heavily-and-hardly-strung chord changes and depressing vocalizations almost always come across simply as a redundant burden rather then a pleasure. Rarely do these limitedly depressing songwriting elements come together as the track ""3 Angels"" does, making the disc hard to recommend."
5,Spyder Turner a must in your CD Collection!!,"An avid oldie lover who's heard them all, however, this one came out of the wood work! In listening to a Sunday Show on KISS FM in San Francisco the DJ Tony Sandoval played this one out of no where. In describing the song it kept me tuned in and just made me fall in love with Spyder Turner's version of Stand By Me so much so I had to go out and get the cd!!! Spyder Turner only one man with many voices, you'll have to hear the song to understand what I mean. (Trust me!!) I'd recommend this cd to anyone who's into good music, and the Show on KISS FM wasn't so bad too. Who knows what other song is yet to be found, though I'm sure Tony will find it. So THANKS!!!"
4,Take me back...,"Well, well, well... Spyder Turners ""Stand By Me"" (the song) is one of the best (yes I KNOW theres a LOT of good music around 1970 +- 3 yrs) songs I've heard from that period. Probably worth buying the whole CD for that song only.Which is what I'm going to do right now. Online."
2,Alley Power Pitch Baseball,"This is a pretty good Idea, Son and I enjoyed it. Problems were found, The ball sticks, have to be tilted to shake loose. It does not always makes announcments on balls, outs and homeruns. Looks and sounds good.It held him for about an hour, then he went to something else. Priced a little high because of the problems. $10 less would be OK."
3,Power Pitch Baseball,"Nice in the box, and easy to assemble. BUT when we started playing with it, it doesn't always give you the correct announcement when the pinball goes into the holes. Otherwise, my son loves it!"
3,old but workable,"I got this book at a good price, but it is the edition before what my techer uses. It does work mostly, there are a few exercises that are different, but it seems to be ok for now."
5,ROCK AND ROLL HEAVEN,"This heavenly disc begins with the title song, the one most of us have heard. The big surprise comes next. The following sixteen songs are all represenative of early rock and roll and doo wop. Curtis Lee is extemely talented and this collection showcases his natural abilities very well. I would say that Curtis Lee is one of the most underrated artists of the rock and roll era. After listening to this disc I only wish I could See Curtis Lee in concert."
3,"""Lonely Weekends""","The last reviwer put down the song ""Lonely Weekends"" by Curtis Lee.I think it is the best song on the cd along with ""Pretty Little Angel Eyes"" and ""Just Another Fool"""
2,"Nice pictures, but Katz has done better","As a reader of Katz's other books, I was sorely disappointed by him (or his editors) - whoever is responsible for the editing the content. I found some of captions to some of pictures to be totally inaccurate (i.e., men exiting a Huey clearly marked with West German marking as elite American soldiers). These errors lead me to believe that some of the writing and facts could also be flawed or inaccurate. I ended up returning the book."
5,Groundbreaking material,"This book is a comprehrensive examination of the world's top couinter-terrorist units, that includes never before seen photographs of many of the world's most elite and top-secret forces. Although security restrictions are evident throughout the book, it is clear that this book will assume an important spot on the library shelves of police and military units around the world."
3,"Its ok,but it can probably be thrown out","this book is ok on the info,but leaves out some ct groups,it also doesnt have much on joint task force-2!"
2,Review of Tidal Wave: No Escape,DVD features: NoneFirst off the dvd features are bad. Only 2.0 sound english and scene selection make this movie already seem bad. The movie is about a terrorist who is making tidal waves and only 2 people can stop them. This movie lacks character development and and a series of dialogue that is uninteresting and intended to explain how tidal waves are possibly made. Some of the dialogue gets too technical thus making the film lame and boring. Next the special effects are weak and action is little in this film. This movie features mild violence and disaster moment but I would recommend this as a family movie (this movie has no rating). I would highly recommend you don't buy this movie.
1,Poor Tidal Wave- FAKE,I really felt that this move deserves less than a star. Its plot was not done well and the use of a nuclear missle to cause a tidal wave does not hold much water - Sorry for the pun. I would not waist my money and buy this. The entire plot and suspense was not good. I watched it and felt I waisted my time. I did not really go for it.
3,Tidal Wave No escape,"If you like natural disaster movies then this is a good one for your collection.this movie is action packed from the get go, your always on the edge of your seat. It is a must see if you liked movies like the day after tomorrow although not as good special effects. this movie is a suffocating race against time that will keep you riding the crest of excitement until its explosive end!!!!!"
3,Very good HID not the shipping process,There is the story.I received wrong item and it took more than a week to get correct one. The purchasing process was longer than expected.Now the kit h4 6000K low and high beam Xenon.I'm very happy with product. Bulbs support fittings are metal not cheap black plastic so output is much better.Low and high beam both are HID Xenon. In cheaper HID light bulbs high beam is another regular bulb attached.All kit parts seems to made to higher standards.It's cost $69.99 but is worth it.I recommend this kit for people looking for good product.If shipper will send correct kit in first place I will rate it 5 stars.
3,Not true color,Lights work great but I have 10k on 3 other cars and they are really blue so I ordered the 10k in this brand and you can't even see a hint of blue more like 6k but other then that lights are good and highbeams are true hid beams as well(hard to find) if you want blue I'd say try the 12k
5,Great Headlights,Great headlights! Very bright. Easy to install. I've had them in for about a month or so and they are working just great! Check out my photos for more detail.
5,Their Best,"You Turn Me On is Beat Happening's masterpiece, a surprisingly accomplished, pretty, and restrained record that remains one of the definative indie-pop records of all-time. This time around, the guitars are clean, the songs are all hits, the cuteness is still high, and Heather Lewis' lush vocals are given more time along with Calvin Johnson's awful-yet-charming baritone. It would be easy to write off Beat Happening as amaturish or ""cutesy,"" but there's something rather refreshing in their simplicity. The innocence of the lyrics and the hypnotic guitars are so passionate and joyful that it proves this band utilized their strengths to maximum effect and truly believed in their art. Sometimes passion is a stronger tool than the conventionial definitions of ""talent."" In my mind, Beat Happening were immensely talented, and this record is ample evidence. Be sure to pick this up when it is re-released, or go all-out and purchase the box-set."
5,A wonderful camera for everyone,My brother has this camera and the pictures are awesome. When we went to las vegas trip with our friends the pictures that we took with this camera were too good. One of our friend has a nikon but the pictures werent as good as ours. Its worth your money.
2,case review,doesn't protect the screen and is made of low quality material. Not even that nice looking. Not worth the money.
1,Not Wide at All,"I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women. I ordered them, waited anxiously, tore open the box when they arrives and...The 4E (which was labeled on the shoes themselves, so it wasn't a mistake in size) was NOT wide AT ALL. They were narrower, in fact, than my mother's medium width shoes. This is NOT an industry standard 4E... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed."
3,Missing features,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
5,K'NEX Lincoln Logs Prairie Express,"This is a very high quality toy,that will last for many years,Tones of fun for the whole family! And it is very exciting addition to our other Lincoln Log products."
3,Cadillac or Volkswagon?,"I found the Lamello plate jointer to be quite a bit like the Freud that it replaced. Don't care for the way the fence mounts, a little cheap I think. Freud was the same. And the adjusting scale was cheesy like the Freud. Can't put in carrying case unless you take the fence off. all small things, but I thought Lamello was the Cadallac of plate jointers, not much more than aVolkswagon to me. Cuts well, guess thats what I paid the high dollars for. Maybe should have just revamped the Freud and sharpened the cutters."
4,"Detailed, thought provoking and powerful","Another gem from Lyn MacDonald. As ever she manages to combine eye witness accounts and detailed narrative into one seamless prose. Whilst reading, it's possible to visualise the battlefield and empathise with the men who fought and died. An excellent book ; wathch out if your'e reading on a train, you might just miss your stop!"
5,Excellent history of how the Germans almost won WW1.,"Very few people could tell the dramatic story of Germany's final offensive of WW1, and how near to victory it brought them, as well as Lyn MacDonald. Drawing on first person accounts she brings the drama of the battle home to the reader. Capturing the experiences of the participants is probably the finest service Ms. MacDonald's work performs. I wish all her previous works on the Great War were republished in hardback."
4,This is not the nit wit comidean!,"This is an album of music from former King Crimson member not the unfunny comidean of same name!! David Cross plays violin and creates some good music as on his previous solo albums..most Crimson fans should enjoy this and his other works,,,AGAIN this is not a comedy album!!"
1,FOR THE TRULY SICK...,"As a cat lover, I find the sentiment expressed by this bumper sticker to be unspeakable. Any bumper sticker that espouses violence is to be avoided. This is a bumper sticker that only a sick individual would affix on his or her car. Do not buy this bumper sticker!"
5,Comfortable!,"I wore these shoes for the first time at the California State Fair. No rubbing, pinching or blistering! No breaking in was needed!"
4,A nice little analysis of Narnia,"When I finished the Narnia series as an adult, I still had questions regarding some of the things I found in the series. While Downing's book did not answer all of my questions, it did give me some background into the life and mind of the great C.S. Lewis. It was a quick read with much information as to specific references within the series and has an incredible list of other works to reference in regards to Lewis and the Narnia chronicles."
2,Slater and Kilmer keep this puppy alive,"starts off good with Slater, Troyer, and two others including his girlfriend try to rob William Forsythes place but it ends up with Slater going into the slammer but then he comes back some months or years later and pulls off a heist that involves Bookem Woodbine, Balthazat Getty, Matthew Schulze and Daryl Hannah, but the problem is that Val Kilmer, a corrupt cop was going to do the heist. all im saying is that Slater and Kilmer do a great cat and mouse game but they should'nt of been in this mess. with wooden characters, but sometimes good action, specifically when the team turns on one another and kills each other over the money. could've been better with different leads"
2,Lacks a sense of style...,"This so-so DTV flick starring surprisingly big names like Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Verne Troyer, and Daryl Hannah somehow manages to deliver very little out of its premise and makes little use of its capable cast. The plot skips from one heist failure to another, but delivers little in the way of action or witty dialogue. Val Kilmer is given little to do as our bad guy and Christian Slater isn't cool enough as the good guy. The film suffers from a poor script and horrendously uninspired directing. Watching it is kind of like watching someone go through their morning routine. It does all it needs to do, but doesn't add anything interesting. What this movie needs is a better script and cooler music. The movie, however, isn't bad enough to get the dreaded one star rating."
1,Oh my God! What happened?,"I have never been so dissapointed in a movie in my life. I grew up a fan of Val Kilmer and Christian Slater's movies, so, it was quite wierd to see a Val Kilmer and Christian Slater premiering on cable. Fortunately, they were not what ruined this movie. I don't know who found this director, but they should have left him in Yugoslavia. I sure hope this isn't the best Yugoslavia has to offer. No, seriously. This director has no real talent. It seems that someone just taught him how to use an editing system. The director had no concept of what transitional effects to use, so it appears that he tried them all. The only thing missing was the star wipe.My advise: Watch this movie in order to see how not to make a movie."
2,Not as bad as people say,"People make this movie out to be the worst movie ever made. They are over reacting. It is not THAT bad. It is not THAT good. It is okay. I liked the beginning. The scam in the beginning with Mini-Me was cool. The second heist wasn't bad either. If it comes on cable, it might be worth watching. overall, not as bad as people say it is."
2,Can't quite put my finger on it...,"My roommate took this camera with her to Chicago. Many of the photos were not impressive, and some were flat out blurry. It was a dissapointment, and frustrating that four rolls of film were just not quite right. This camera will be added to the garage sale pile this summer. I'm looking for another point and shoot..."
1,No hardware included!,The eagle was in two pieces which required two finishing screws to connect. The screws were missing. I had to buy them separately from Ace Hardware.
3,short,"after watching the movie (Sean Connery & Michael Cain), I always wanted to read the original. it's a short read. and for once, the movie WAS better."
5,String Concerto,String Concerto is a 1990 BMG Music recording starring Guildhall String Ensemble and they are directed by Robert Saler. Peter Avis has written the music notes and included is also a short biography of the ensemble. A quite remarkable and enjoyable recording. A very fine performance on behalf of the Guildhall String Ensemble. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
4,Works well,"This seat fit on the toilet perfectly and very durable. Had hip replacement surgery November 2012, after getting home from the hospital the seat was the proper height. The price paid was fair."
3,Fits fine but...,"Seat is well made and fits as expected, but it could have a recess in front for male body parts."
3,OK but not great,The seat works well for travel but not for every day use. It's difficult to get at yourself to clean.
4,raised toilet seat,Very easy to install and use. Had hip replacement surgery and have a little difficulty getting down on regular toilet seats. Along with side rails this solves the problem.
3,Works ok,"Works ok, but if had to do again ( hip replacement surgery) I would purchase the type that clamps on for stability."
3,Seat works after I did some modifications.,"I wanted to use the raised seat without removing the flip up toilet seat, so that others using the toilet would not be inconvenienced. The raised seat would not rest properly on the commode bowl with the flip up seat in place. I had to use a rotary tool and a hacksaw to cut two openings in the rear vertical face of the raised seat to fit around the hinges on the flip up seat. After I did that, it worked fine. I think the product description should make it more clear that this seat is designed to fit a standard commode ""after the flip up seat has been removed."""
5,You Might Need it.,"Bought it for my Wife for after the Knee Replacement Surgery but if you are having a Hard time getting off the Toilet because it is too Low this is the Solution, inexpensive and it works, I weight over 320lbs and have been using it too with out a problem."
4,Carex raised toilet seat is fine,"bought this in anticipation of hip surgery. found it comfortable and suitable to task. decided not to buy a toilet seat riser with built in arms as being insufficiently stable (from other Amazon reviews), and so purchased a separate set of arms that rest on the floor to assist in sitting and rising."
4,"easy install,but seat may be too high for some","My mother broke her hip and when we got her home I was told by many that this would really help her. This is a great product and is simple to install, no hardware, it just sits firmly in the bowl. However, I should have done a bit more research because they are not all the same thickness. This one is so high my mother's feet don't come close to touching the floor which she does not like. There are seats like this that are not as thick, which we are now going to purchase. Not the fault of the manufacturer, this product shipped fast and is great, I just wanted to let others know of my mistake in not researching which one my mom needed."
4,good raised seat,fits well & is easy to install and remove - looks clean and neat- we needed it after hip surgery
1,Not Good!!!,"I had to throw this toilet seat away. It doesn't have a depression in the front and I could not clean myself. I got the Etac Hi-Loo with brackets as a replacement. the Etac works great. It has depressions in both the front and back.Also the Carex was too high for me. The Etac is just the right height. I'm 5' 5"" tall.And then the Carex is unstable. It moves around. On the other hand the Etac stays in place.I suggest you buy the Etac Hi-Loo with brackets instead of the Carex."
2,Meh.,I had surgery so I purchased this seat to use temporarily. This seat was ok but it made it very difficult to clean myself. There is no notch or groove in the front or back to allow for reach. Also without getting too graphic the small opening made visits to the loo a whole lot messier. Cleansing myself was an ordeal that required extra time and technique. The design of this seat could use some work as it may create problems for larger sized people.
3,Secured only by stickie pads,"It's secured only by three rubber pads. I don't find it sturdy enough to trust until someone gets hurt, so I'll be returning it.But for the money, it's 3 stars."
2,raised toilet seat,Not very stable. Shifts when sitting and also tips when exiting. Was not very happy with this product. Needs to have firmer anchors especially since this product is aimed at the elderly or infirm.
2,Does not fit elongated toilets,"The item itself seems well constructed (which is why I gave it two stars) but the product description claims that it fits on elongated toilets. However, it does not fit securely on an elongated toilet. Hence, it slips, which could be dangerous to an elderly or disabled person. For that reason I returned it."
5,Light to guide your way in relationships,"I think this book is GREAT, and I don't apply superlatives lightly. This book simply contains wisdom, a trait not found often (as opposed to knowledge or intelligence), it is compassionate and encouraging. I happen to be single and I found it very encouraging, probably one of my 10 favorite books of all time. It is written with Christian ""beliefs"", which I think most Christians will love, and it would still be extremely helpful for others, without losing any of it's power if that is not your faith."
4,Interesting,"It seemed a good selection (though the two first pieces seem to address the same thing and are similar in content, if not in tone). I was a little bothered by what seemed to me an excessive sentimentality in the ""Slave Girl"" narrative and the ""Biography of Ex-Colored Man"", but I would be the first to say that the reading was educational."
5,Great fit,Weathered our first windy snowstorm with ease. Snug fit at base kept wind from causing it to billow. Sturdy fabric.
2,flimsy trash,tore at seams in 20 mph wind. the manufacturer used the cheapest and weakest material they coud find. NO GOOD
4,Does OK,"It doesn't fit as tight as the original. But since the original is not made anymore, this will have to do."
4,Great Cover!,This is a great cover that fits our smaller sized grill perfectly. It is heavy duty with velcro ends that holds the cover in place during windy days. I previously purchased a cheaper cover that hardened when it became cold and easily ripped. It pays to purchase something a little better and this cover is ideal.
1,Did Not Hold Up,This did not hold up very long. We got it just a few months ago and it is already torn.
1,not what you should expect,I bought this as an online alternative to the ones at the store which I figured to be over-priced. Silly me. First winter (the grill and cover both are under 6 months old) and ALL 4 corners have teared.
1,this book is a mess,"typos everywhere. really needs an editor. way too many characters. too many plots. it's like 3 books in one. munchausen, nuclear waste, peodophilia, stalkers, relationship break ups and typo typo typo."
3,Dark Side of the Moon,"I read the first Laura Cardinal book & loved it, but this second one-The Dark Side of the Moon was a different story altogether. I liked the book, however there were so many grammar errors and mistakes in the book, that I found it distracting. The mistakes were easily detected the second I read the sentences. I don't understand how a book can be published with so many errors. I wonder if no one proof read it? The book was good overall, just too many errors. I just bought book 3, as I really like Laura, not to mention Frank Entsistle!"
2,Dictionary Please,"The book was good, but I felt like the author got carried away with the thesaurus. I also highlighted several grammar errors and typos."
2,Has been edited but not proofread,"Interesting storyline, reasonable character development, unfortunately there appear to be some editor's comments not picked up by proof-reading. Disappointing, but easy to address in the next novel I presume"
4,"Fun read, but harder to get into than Book 1","When I started this book, I wasn't sure I was going to like it and that disappointed me because I really liked the first Laura Cardinal book ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"" a lot. But, I stuck with it and was glad I did. The plot twists kept me guessing which is nice because I hate it when you figure things out from page 1. There are some editing problems in this Kindle version and a couple times I had to go re-read a passage because two unrelated scenes blended together due to a lack of spacing between them. Overall, a fun read if you like crime fiction series. Looking forward to reading the 3rd book next!"
3,Good Read,"One of my first Kindle purchases,Dark Side of the Moon is a good read for those of us who love a good murder, mayhem and catching the bad guy story. The plot is complex enough to keep you turning the page, but not so complex you lose interest. Dark Side of the Moon an imaginative spin on the well known nightmare of a serial killer of teenage girls, and Laura Cardinal is well developed and entertaining crime fighter. This book contains a lot of realistic crime and procedural detail. J. Carson Black's writing is very well done and there is an outcome that is not predictable half way through the story."
3,Too many typos and errors!,"Dark Side of the Moon is a good story and i like Laura Cardinal quite well but I agree with the review by Ka. The errors and typos are frustrating. I found myself reading and rereading entire paragraphs thinking I must have missed something or read something wrong. At one point the author called a major character by the wrong name. Book one in the series had similar problems making me reluctant to buy book three. The editor, assuming there is one, should be ashamed. Poor editing is an embarrassment to the author and to the publisher."
2,Just too much going on,"Have you ever read a book where you just loved the plot, the idea of where the story could go, but then just found it so complicated that it wasn't an enjoyable read? Sadly, I found myself skimming through alot of this book just to get to the end. I mean, I really did want to see how it would end, it was just so much work to get there. There was just too many characters to keep track of, characters that were not central to the whole storyline and it just made the whole story muddled and over-complicated. While I truly like the central figure of Laura Cardinal, I just had a difficult time with everyone else....I agree with some of the other reviews that there were also just too many storylines going and and it just became a jumbled mess for me. I always had trouble picking up where I left off. I think the author needs to trim down all the 'extras' that really were not necessary to the story."
3,typo typhoid,"Dark Side of the Moon, the second in the Laura Cardinal Series is a great story but I have never seen so many typos in my sixty years of reading. It's distracting and, at times, infuriating. Is the editing the problem or is the Kindle the problem? It is ridiculous. Could they at least get the names right? I've put the Kindle down several times with the intention of writing this review, only to stop and give it another chance, hoping it will stop. But, no, it does not stop; it gets progressively worse. Did no one proof read this book?! Are you kidding me? There are literally hundreds of typos. Very disappointing as I love the story. Shame on you."
4,GREAT SERIES,"Liked all of these Laura Cardinal books, but did find them similar. I read them in order and would have read a 4th if it were available."
1,Soapnet put it back on air,they are like the Gas people want more money out of u maybe Soapnet will put it back on air soon does this have both part 1&2 in set i love this show nver knew how it ended love to know hurry get it done and do it right
1,to all the SMART consumers out there who didnt purchase yet,"i suggest to follow me-instead of making an IMPULSIVE DUMB purchase and waste important money on split seasons (that created only to steal money from consumers in daylight by paramount and amazon),to keep waiting for the full series package in a reasonable low price...it might take up to 20 years till it will be released,but then again i lived more then 20 years after the show ended in 1989 withoutthe impulse to buy the series so waiting more 20 years will be a PIECE OF CAKE.:)"
1,Where's the respect of customers ??,"Just like other comments, I am really disappointed with the releasers of Dynasty dvd's. What do they think? That we are so stupid to buy half boxes or feel obliged to buy a combined 3 season box set to get season 3?I am trully frustrated with such a way of not being customer oriented.Can't they simply release each season completely, one after the other? Is it that difficult or are they only thinking about trying to make monney? I really encourage everybody NOT to buy half seasons or set up boxes (except maybe a full series box set). And let's hope they will be wiser with the continuation of the series."
1,"Why the long, long wait?","I greatly enjoyed the series when it was on in the 1980's and would love to have the entire series on DVD. What I don't understand is why, after 20 years, I still can't buy it unless I order one from China which is just a cheap knock-off and is very poorly produced. If the entire set were put out by Paramount, I'd grab it in a heartbeat as I'm sure a lot of other fans would do. Shame on Paramount!!!"
1,"Three Pack Seasons one, two, three????????????????","Ok what is going on now???????????? I waited for Dynasty Season 3 the complete season.........So what happened they give us Dynasty Season 3 Vol. One..........if that isnt bad enough Amazon pulled it out from under us and are not even selling it.........now they are offering Dynasty Season 3 Vol. Two for pre-order October 21st also they are putting out A Dynasty Complete Three Season Pack 1,2,3 for preorder October 21st.......... well thats just great am I going to have to buy it to get Season 3 What the hell am I going to do with the Seasons One and Two that I already have..... This is obsured and I am not the only one that is angry.......Amazon should take a stand and threaten these companies for getting away with charging full price for half seasons well if amazon wants to lose business then I guess they might be forcing us to shop elsewhere maybe ""EBAY"""
1,Splitting seasons is splitting fans,"Paramount and Fox are good for this, you show interest, we slow the faucet. Disgusting. ""We the fans, in order to form a more perfect union... establish justice ensure season tranquility...""Keep doing this Fox and Paramount, we can't wait to buy your split sets in a bargin bin for 1/3rd the price at a discount store when you can't sell them."
1,Shameful? Yes. Amazon's fault? No.,"It is indeed shameful that Paramount has tried to take advantage of its customers (or, the way it is going, former customers). However, Amazon has no fault in how Paramount has chosen to release DYNASTY in split seasons. Amazon is simply the distributor/reseller.It is great that people have started taking a stand against such customer abuse. Yet, we do still have those spoiled, elite few who think we are crazy for complaining. They seem to forget that Paramount has released DYNASTY: SEASON 3 split in two, all in ONE year. DYNASTY has NINE seasons. So, at this rate, can we all wait NINE YEARS until they release the final season? And while you are at it, take out your calculators and do the math to see how much you will pay...Meanwhile, Warner Bros. has catered to its customers by releasing FULL seasons of DALLAS at a rate of three seasons a year and reasonable prices. THAT is what I call customer respect."
1,Most deceptive info ever,"The info section states 400 feet,the instructions say 30 feet(and I couldn't get to work at that distance)! It's also from RadioShack. This is the most dishonest information I've ever seen on Amazon and am extremely disappointed they let this occur.The equipment is junk, no surprise."
5,sport and leadership,"this book is an easy and pleasant read, yet delivers great information on leadership. the authors have used a wide variety of sporting examples to explain hard core leadership principles. because they use sport as the metaphor it becomes a management book that you can't put away."
4,Short and fun,I heard this recording on Facebook and thought it would be fun to listen to in the car. It just allows an open road feeling that I need to add to the mix of music I listen to.
2,"OK, but you don't get much for the money.","This jig is OK, and yes, you can produce nice, tight joint with it. However, the base model (without the attachments) is almost as expensive as a Leigh. Compare the two products-Leigh: ..., does adjustable pins, through, sliding, and hlaf blind - all included.PC 7116 - $329, but you need several hundred dollars in additional attachments to make the same sets of joints.I'm not one to cut corners, and I don't buy tools because they're cost-effective. I buy tools that do their jobs well. In the case where two tools work equally well, though, buy the one that is less expensive, very well made, and takes up less space in your shop.I've noticed a perponderance of ""rave reviews"", without much commentary on the shortcomings. I'm a big PC fan- i use their router with my Leigh jig. The 7116, though, isn't best-in-class."
4,"Well made Jig, could be more flexible","I've been using the 24"" Omnijig for about 2 years now, and recently bought some more of the template guides so I could do some more sophisticated work. The jig does an excellent job for almost all joints, but is limited in it capabilities when it comes to Adj. through dovetails. It is not very easy, if not impossible to do offset joints with this machine. My brother has a Leigh Jig and I would say that while more difficult to configure, offers greater flexibility. If you have a bunch of dovetails to cut, the Omnijig is it. s"
5,"Excellent, but expensive unit. Worth every penny.","If you read nothing else, read this: WATCH THE INCLUDED VIDEO TAPE!!! If you don't watch it and you don't setup the machine correctly in the beginning, you will become frustrated. I have never made machine dovetail joints before this purchase. I drove to Woodworker's Warehouse to buy this unit since I wanted it right away and I didn't know that Amazon even sold it. After hours of initial frustration, I watched the video tape and I was making perfect dovetails within a half hour. I am building kitchen cabinets and this machine enables me to create a drawer in less than 10 minutes since the dovetails take only about 30-40 seconds per corner! If you need to use the machine to do lots of joins and you need easy and predictable setup, but this jig!"
5,A decision gone right !,"After looking at many dovetail jigs I decided to purchase the Omni 24"" and I feel after using the jig it was a decision gone right ! After the set up and a trial run, I was in business making dove tails like the best of them. The unit is very well constructed and I don't think anyone could ever wear it out. I wanted a unit that was not so complicated to use, that it would take me hours to get the first cut made. The Omni seems to fill that order. I ordered the adjustable fingers and will file a review after I use it and see how well it works. One thing I have noticed already is the adjustable template takes a 3/4"" 14degree dovetail bit, not the most popular one in town but attainable."
2,Interesting for fans but terribly written,"I'm a huge Yankee fan so I enjoyed the opportunity to remember the events of their first championship season in nearly two decades, but Sherman desperately needs an editor. The book completely lacks structure, with tangent building on tangent to form an incoherent mess. There are diamonds in the rough in the form of interesting revelations, but getting to them can be hard work indeed."
4,feel good film,a film that simply shows that anyone can change!I feel that there is a good side to anyone.It just needs to be discovered!
5,"A great ""pick me up.""",This is a great movie to see some old fashioned values and charm. See a high class girl learn what life is really about and fall in love at the same time. A great movie for a rainy day or anytime your spirit needs a lift.
4,GREAT movie!,This is a different take on the traditional fairy tale of Cinderella. Ally Sheedy gave a wonderful performance and I was so glad to finally have a dvd copy of this movie!
5,*Enjoyable Movie To Watch*,I really liked this movie alot.It was a fairy tale type movie.A movie to teach a lesson in life while also being enjoyable to watch.A very good 80's movie that can be enjoyed by all.
