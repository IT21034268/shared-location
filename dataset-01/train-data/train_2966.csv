2,NO LINUX SUPPORT,"This card works great with Windows 2000 and a D-Link 802.11g Wireless Access Point.My major complaint is that Linksys has stopped providing the specs for their chipsets as of the 802.11g series. The 802.11b series cards work great with Linux/*NIX, but the 802.11g does not and will not work at all. Apparently the company Linksys chose for the chipset, Broadcom [www.broadcom.com] refuses to release the specs so no one can write drivers without months of experimentation and reverse-engineering.I have always found that devices that do not provide linux support are inferior in quality and reliability to other devices that do."
2,Jiggle the card people. The problem is in the housing.,"I have lost a day of my life trying to get this thing to work and in the end the problem was... <drumroll> THE CARD HOUSING. Eternal thanks to whoever wrote the review pointing out this problem.If I pushed it up while the card was in the upper slot, I could get intermitent signal, when I moved it down to the lower slot it started working reliably.Shoddy, very shoddy Linksys. I had two Linksys hubs die on me before, so I should have known better than to buy this thing, but I figured what the hell. Well, once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, three times is enemy action. I won't buy another Linksys product again.I also find it ironic that even if they know about this problem, they'll never put it on the support website, since that would be admitting to a design defect. Oh well."
2,Does not work with Linux,I bought this card to work with my Linux laptop. It does not come with Linux driver and it is not easy to make it work with Linux but possible.If I had to buy another card I would buy some other more Linux friendly vendor.
5,Works great so far!,"I use this in an Apple PowerBook G4 (17"" model) along with a Netgear 802.11g wireless router and SBC/Yahoo DSL. Thus far I have had no problems. I have also used it in other places with other wireless access points. Again, no problems.If you're trying to get a home wireless network set up, remember to read and follow all the instructions. If things don't seem to be working, try changing the channel that your wireless access point is using. I've had times when I can't connect to my access point doe to interference from other access points. Changing the channel has always solved the problem."
5,Excellent value for the buck,"I went for this card because I wanted something unexpensive for one of my older laptops (Dell Inspiron 8000). I picked Linksys because they are a subsidiary of Cisco (which I hold to a good reputation).I am very pleased so far, the card works great with both Windows 2000 and Fedora Core 4 (the 2 OS-es loaded on my said laptop). The hub in our house is a Apple AirPort and I have never lost the signal (as some of the other reviewers have complained).Getting it to work with Linux was a bit of a hassle but now that I figured it out (see http://the-free-meme.blogspot.com/2006/01/holidays-are-over-happy-new-year-and.html)it actually boots up and connects faster than with Win2k."
1,worked horribly,"This card worked terribly. I already owned an A/B/G card from Linksys and it worked great. But this B/G card didn't work at all on the same laptop and on other laptops I tried. I purchased another linksys A/B/G and was very pleased. Even if you are using the G network, spend the extra money to get the A/B/G card (if you're getting the linksys)."
1,I Rate this in one word - JUNK,"This is the second time tht I am wriing this review. The first time the %&^% adapter lost the connection. I normally do not take the time to write a review but after the junk device dropped session 4 tie in the pace of an hour I felt compelled to vent. Then after writing the first review the junk device dropped connection again. One would think that in todays business climit a company would ensure that their products worked with each other. but between this and the linksys AP it's like living in the 90's.Bottom line, buy another vendors product, stay away from this one."
2,So So,"I figured I would spend the money for this card. There are a lot of other cards out there for less that does essentially the same thing. The profile of this card isn't the best. It sticks out an inch. I figured this would translate to better reception. Not so. Signal quality is very twitchy and I often need to relocate. For the price I would expect better. For example, I have used NetGear for less $$ but better reception. This is not a bad product but not worth the extra $$. Try something else."
2,Probably would not buy again,"I was able to install this product and use it fine for about a week or two. Then I started getting error messages at boot-up saying files were missing. The software cannot be reinstalled because it must be uninstalled first, the files to uninstall are missing and it cannot be done. Basically I am caught in a catch-22. Called Linksys and the tech support was substandard (almost like they were reading from a script). I was told they have never had a single complaint on this product, and there was nothing I could do but go back to Amazon to resolve the issue (isn't that Cisco's job?). I am running Windows xp home. You may have better luck than I did, but buyer beware..."
1,Don't buy this card...,"Tried to install this card on both a Windows 2000 SP4 PC and a Windows XP Pro SP3 PC with the same result...the drivers would NOT install, no matter what I tried. By the way, I've been working with computers for a living for 22 years, and have never seen anything that can't be installed properly. After wasting about 8 hours of my life trying to install it, I finally gave up and put it back in the box it came in. Installed a different model Linksys card in about 5 minutes with no problems. Unless you have an immense amount of time to try to figure out how to get the drivers to install, do NOT purchase this card."
1,No Show,"Boring and not much insight. Just a rap film, nothing about the true culture of hip-hop. Some decent preformances, but if you want to really get the real, check out Rhyme & Reason."
3,This is not all that,"The only reason I rented this wuz 2 see tha greatest rapper to ever touch a mic, biggie smalls. Dre iz ok also, but its all about tha east coast!!"
3,Poor Printing,"The content of this book is great, but the copy I got has blurred printing on many of the pages in the back."
4,"HEY MAN, THIS IS PRETTY DECENT","i love ""rare groove"" cds like this. this is like a breath of fresh air to me when i get tired of the radio............which is often. the first 13 joints on here have a nice, groovin' ebb and flow to it. the last four songs are instrumentals of previous songs on the cd. i wish that they would've put some more cuts on here to finish out the album. however, for the most part, it's an enjoyable listen."
4,"For older frame converted to ""Fixed Gear Bicycle""","This unit is a bit long, but it made the conversion to a fixed gear easier with the parts I had acquired to make a nice bicycle to practice my pedal skills...MT"
5,Stunning piece of artistry.,Dreamily ethereal to powerful with soaring studio effects the music seems to surround you from every direction. The subsequent releases are also good but they do not reach the caliber of this debut. There is not a single weak song here.
1,NIJ-Pale Blue Day,"Brit-sounding pop? No way...! The music tries to rip off the Verve, but doesn't come close. The vocals are over the place. Let's see how many vocal ranges I can do....please. Give it up. This cd [stinks] and I own it, and have seen them live. Don't buy this cd."
2,"Pretty Good, But With Serious Deficiencies","Mr. Saperstein's personal credibility leaves much to be desired. First, and most troubling, is that he describes himself as a through-hiker, but isn't - by his own admission. He hiked the trail in two time periods separated by months. Sorry, Mr. Saperstein, but that's not through-hiking. The other troubling aspect to the text is his constant hyping of homeopathic remedies. Mr. Saperstein may be a very bright guy, but just as I would expect people to take everything I say with a grain of salt if I constantly reminded them that I had been abducted by aliens, I often wondered if the text I was reading was ""reality based."" Having said all that, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it to those contemplating a through-hike, including to Mr. Saperstein, should he ever decide to do it."
3,talking faces and video documentary,"I ordered The People's Nepal so I could learn more about the recent history of Nepal as background for an upcoming trip. From the talking faces and the action videos, I did get a flavor of this bit of recent history. I don't feel that I got an in-depth analysis."
2,Will Not Work Properly With Unsupported DVD Media,"You pay almost twice the price that you pay for other DVD burners. Then you waste four or five DVD's before you find out by doing Internet research that it will not burn ""unsupported"" DVD media at highest speed. Of course, burning software should tell you that or adjust the burning speed for successful burn. However, that is too much to ask from free Roxio software that Plextor will give you. It is bad engineering on Plextor's part that they will even not bundle a single sheet of paper, saying up front that what media the burner will support!"
3,Does not play all original DVD's,"Unit works great. Only one BIG dissapointment, It did not play an original DVD movie that I just purchased. Updated to latest firmware and still doesn't play it. Well...my old Sony also didn't play some original DVD's. I had high hopes that this one would but guess not."
5,DVD Drive Excellent,"The drive was very easy to install. It works excellent in DVD-R or CD-R mode. No coasters produced. The one drawback is software. If you do not have a full product of Roxio or Ulead, you will not take advantage of drive."
3,burns slow on linux,"the drive is fine but it has compatibility problems with linux.if you are using linux, it runs very slowly (0.6x) and won't burn DVD-R's directly (you have to create an iso image and then write it...weird."
3,Poorly Advertised,"I purchased this used computer for my daughter, so unfortunately I was not able to visually look at this product. For the MOST part, my daughter likes the overall look, however, we were NOT informed that the battery life was close to DEAD. When she charged it to it's full capacity, which was only about a quarter of the way, she noticed that is registered REPLACE BATTERY SOON! How's that for POOR ADVERTISEMENT.This is the first time I've had any issues on purchasing a product from AMAZON. Needless to say, this won't stop me from doing business with AMAZON, but it will however, make me more cautious of where AMAZON picks it's products from."
3,Generates light blue fog and it flies up,The bottling(cap) is sloppy so it might wet your delivery box. It generates light blue fog and the fog flies up. It doesn't stay on the ground. It might be the temperature of the fog generated by the machine. It's warm.
4,Good stuff!!,This is a thick fog that fills a room which is what I was looking for because i have a laser show and with a thick fog you can really see the laser beams. The fog lingers in a room for a good time to so you get you moneys worth. The cap on the bottle for some reason is made poorly and can be a bit messy which is why i gave it a 4. Only got to use it once though and then my fog machine took a dump on me. I was reading some other reviews on people wanting a low laying fog to get this effect you need to cool the fog that comes out of you machine there are some techniques of doing this on youtube and from some research you can buy a low laying fog machine but expect to pay a large amount of money. But anyway if you want a thick heavy fog this is the right stuff for you. I was very happy with it.
5,first time user,THIS IS GREAT STUFF. THE PRODUCT WORKED JUST AS IT WAS ADVERTISED. BEING FIRST TIME USER IT WAS SIMPLE AND EASY
2,ok fog,fog juice leaves residue anywhere its pointed and makes it all slimy so i probably wont buy chauvet brand again because it said no residue on it
5,Moving!,"Very relaxing, and has character. A nice blend of traditional and synthetic instruments that will take you on journeys! Listen to before falling asleep."
4,A good addition to a New Age Collection,"I really like this music. Individually each piece is worth the price, but listened to as a collection the style can get a bit monotonous. The music is actually best heard when mixed in with other artists and styles of 'environmental' music. I have encountered the same problems with other excellent artists. A Herb Alpert collection can be a little too much trumpet for one sitting but sounds great when mingled with saxaphone pieces or piano. It's the same with this album.Definetly worth the purchase if you enjoy New Age/Environmental Music with some recognizable form and conventional themes."
5,Great relaxation music,I first heard this music on Pandora. It caught me attention and I went to look for more. I highly recommend this CD for any one who seek tranquility and relaxation.
5,"Brilliant, Inspired, Dazzling!","Those words represent the sum total of the gorgeous music from David Helpling and Jon Jenkins' collaboration in this new tableau of musical excellence. Every emotional expression is stimulated by soaring moments that take you far, far away into spirit; or deep within those hidden valleys, exquisitely plumbing your soul.Perfection represents consumate refinement of skills and mastery by it's creators. You can hear it's expression in heavenly, chll inducing moments as they merge into aural bliss. The depth and loveliness on these songs particularly ""The Knowing"" and ""The Frozen Channel"", each transcendent; ""The First Goodbye"" haunting. ""Treasure"" essays treasure gloriously."
5,Introducing Rigor to Marketing Spending,"With Marketing ROI, Jim Lenskold has introduced a very useful level of financial rigor into what the typically imprecise process of targeting investments in marketing and then measuring their impact on company profits. Two key concepts introduced are how Marketing ROI is correctly calculated (many companies do it wrong), and more importantly, how the Marketing ROI informantion is used to manage marketing investments, looking at the incremental investment in marketing, and its incremental effect on sales and profitablity. Jim covers the subject from a big company perspective, focusing on multi-product, multi-customer segment environments, but the concepts in the book can also be applied to small companies concerned with spending marketing dollars most effectively.This is a key text to be used along with the latest in customer relationship management techniques and customer information technology to manage the profitability of a company's demand chain."
3,"Interesting, but not great.","The book has very interesting views on the approach to ROI as a main marketing decision making tool. However, it is not well written and some concepts seem like they are explained to ""look"" more complicated than they really are. I think that this book deserves a review and a new edition, to make the reader experience more enjoyable. It is, however, worth reading."
5,"Nice compass, but not what you see in the picture","For $6 dollars, this compass does just about everything I purchased it for. It gives accurate readings and is reasonably durable. The compass isn't exactly what you see in the picture, but what you receive is actually nicer than the product depicted. If you're looking for a cheap compass that will get the job done, I would recommend this."
4,About the size of a Silver dollar --,"This is a relatively small plastic compass. Its the size of a silver dollar, about 1/2 inch thick. Its fairly easy to level it so the compass needle swings north but you do have to hold it level. The compass needle is red with one end tip silver. You wouldn't want to use this compass for precise navigation but it will get you in the general direction. There is no bezel, sight, etc. Just a plastic compass."
5,Compass,"Got this for my dad for Christmas, it was exactly what he was wanting. Arrived quickly and was very affordable."
4,Good new find,"A style that takes some getting used to, but enough surprises to hold the reader's interest. Well done."
3,Buyer Beware....,"I've enjoyed all of Mr Moore's books that I have read (Under the Overtree, Fireworks, Possessions and Rabid Growth <the last 2 less so, but still fun>, AND Serenity Falls). I just finished Serenity Falls about 1 month ago and was looking for more books online when I saw the 3 'new' Serenity falls books listed (Writ In Blood, The Pack, and Dark Carnival). I figured they were a continuation of the first...but they are not. I've only read Writ in Blood (as the other 2 are not out yet). It's a good read, but it's only 50% new. He's elaborated on Crowley some and expanded Simon McGruder - but he tips his hand too early in this book; the big 'villain' is revealed way too soon in this 'new' book. And like I said, half the text is the exact same as 'Serenity Falls'. I guess I feel cheated by this book. I am curious if there will be any changes but I don't want to read the entire same story again."
2,Not worth the hype...,"I have tried to get into this book three times, now, and I just can't work up any excitement for it. The write ups make it sound far more exciting that I've discovered it to actually be. I'm glad I only ordered the first book & not everything he's written. The concept is pretty interesting, but the pacing is blunted, and none of the characters have engaged my imagination or interest, so far...And yes, this means I still haven't been able to finish this book, because it's just not that interesting, on the whole..."
1,Save your time and money.,This was the first book I have read that actually made me angry for being such a remarkable piece of garbage. How did this get published? And two more books to follow? Unbelievable waste of paper! This book is just a ludicrous mish mash of poor plotting. You can buy this book used through Amazon sellers for 1 cent. One penny! And this book is still NOT worth it.
3,"Allright...quick, light read","Overall a quick read. While I like the premise, and some of the spooky scenarios, I didn't really feel for any of the characters. They just seemed a little wooden without much development. Also, you kind of have to suspend belief...with so much going on in this town you're like ""the press never caught on to this?"" (like when the teenagers on the hill disappeared...then reappeared). And some characters just disappeared from the story to suddenly randomly appear way down the line (like Nancy). Overall it was okay, with some good creepy scenes, but I just didn't feel much suspense b/c I really didn't care that much for the characters."
4,Easy set up,"I support the network at a local school. I've installed 8 of these AP for wireless access. They are easy to setup and they work. Note, I don't use the software setup utility. I log in to the AP and set them up manually. So, I can't really say how the sw set up is to work with. But, the web-based manual setup is easy and works well. Are building are long metal structures and the coverage is good considering the material construction of the building. The most difficult thing about using AP devices is getting power to them. The device itself works great.Linksys looses 1 star (4 instead of 5) for NOT labeling the AC adapter. At least put Linksys on it. Yes, a piece of tape and sharpie marker works..."
2,Overly complicated to set up,"I had to search around the interne looking for a guide on how to set up WAP client mode, And the included CD-Rom doesn't even come with a wizard or anything to help you do that.You had to set your network adapter to Static IP, then find find the WAP's default Static IP, which wasn't even written anywhere in the packaging. After all that, it wasn't too difficult to finish what I started. But gosh darn! Why the heck is it so complicated?! there's not even a manual to get you through all this, hence why I had to search around the internet for help."
3,Great for small networks... very small. And unimportant.,"Don't buy this if you just want to use it as a repeator - it doesn't support WPA, and given that WEP security will only last 3-4 hours (if you're lucky) its not a very secure device to use to try and extend your wireless network.If all you need is a small access point to make your home network wireless (and don't plan on extending that wireless coverage), go for it."
1,Beware when using with WPA-Enterprise,"We bought this AP to use with WPA Enterprise using a radius server and basically, it dosen't work. At first we couldn't get it to communicate with our radius server at all. We resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked. Then authentication worked, but we couldn't get an address via DHCP. We couldn't resolve this so we assigned a static address, but couldn't pass any traffic over the link. Unfortunately, we found the Linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless. There only suggestion was to try different firmware. Once we had done this, they couldn't help any more. So basically, they might say it works, but it doesn't. Tried a different manufacturers AP, worked straight away."
2,"Buggy configuration interface, lousy support","If I were you, I'd wait before buying this or else look to another 802.11g vendor.The problem I have is that if I reconfigure the device via the web interface (say, to change the password or SSID) then the WAP dies. Wireless seems to still work but I can no longer connect to it via the LAN port. Hard reset is the only fix. I suspect this is a simple firmware bug (v1.05), but it's a good reason not to buy the product.The other problem is that Linksys support is awful. The website doesn't even have support pages yet. Calls to the 1800 number indicate ""heavy call volume"" no matter what time of day or night. Their email support guy in the Phillipines ignored my detailed request for confirmation of this bug and just gave me the generic ""reset your device"" instructions. Not helpful."
1,Deceptive Box Text,"The box says it can act as a repeater with your existing network, however it is only compatable with other linksys routers and access points, a completely unnessecary restriction if you know anything about wireless networks. They use standard frequencies and languages, the only reason it would only work with certain routers is that linksys specifically wrote the firmware that way to force you to buy more of their products.This wouldn't suck so much if it said so ANYWHERE on the box, but it doesn't say it until you've installed the device and connect to configure it, then you get a small warning at the bottom of the menu that it will only work with their other products."
1,Useless product,"I purchases the WAP54G and the WPC54G. Set up was easy.I found the WAP54G was unstable when I used a VPN over the wired connection. A firmware upgrade corrected this problem.My first attempt at wireless also worked on the first try. Then I tried 128bit WEP. The wireless connection fails at very regular intervals (3 minutes 6 seconds). 64bit WEP was stable and it was stable with WEP disabled.Linksys service made several suggestions (all obvious). After trying all channels and various hardware placements, both 64bit and 128bit WEP now fail at 3min 6sec intervals. With WEP disabled the connection is stable.I have wasted many hours on this thing. I am now shopping for a different brand."
2,Works Flawlessly,"I set up the access point and and installed the notebook card on my laptop in less than 30 minutes. The speeds are as good as my wired desktop machine. Be sure to carefully read the instructions thoroughly before installing. It will save you time. If you have trouble connecting at first, be sure to review the ip address settings on the access point. My only glitch was not putting in the correct default gateway on the access point. Once I corrected that, I was connected. If you already are using a router, go with the access point."
3,Average,Sometimes I am unable to get online and have been unable to determine why. Seems to interfear with cell phone use as well. Most of the time the product works.
1,WAP54G - misrepresented,"Beware of Linksys and the WAP54G. They advertise that the WAP54G supports WPA security, but it only supports WPA in certain modes. Also, my experience is that Linksys technical support is substandard. I urge caution. There are other, better vendors out there."
5,Works Great,I have 3 desktop computers which are wired to an 8 port router; I bought a laptop with a wireless 802.11b card built it. I wanted to add it to my network and so installed the AP by connecting it to my router. Works Great. Support from Linksys has also been a plus.
3,Not for personal use,"This item may be very useful in a business setting. However, it is very unlikely that it could be used in many homes. It cannot plug directly into a broadband modem, and it requires that it detect your system before you can set it up. So if you live near several other stronger signals this becomes increasingly difficult. Once again, they never said this product was intended for home networking..but in my opinion it would be a rare situation when you would need it for home networking."
1,Does this thing work as a repeater with WPA security? Not for me!,I wanted a wireless repeater with WPA security. As far as I can find from information online it will not work like this. It may work in WEP but that is old and weak. I didn't want to go backwards. I had problems connecting it to my router a WRT54GS with the CD and after mutiple attempts it would show up. I can't tell you how it works in the other modes since I didn't want it to work as a wired AP. I wanted to extend the range and strength of my wireless signal to an area in my home with a weak signal from my current router location wirelessly. I've decided to upgrade my old trusty WRT54GS with a newer router. We'll see if that helps and If I have to return it I guess I'll research some stronger antenna options other than my Linksys 7dbi that are currently on the router. Good luck!
2,Access Point needs constant rebooting,"This unit installed fairly easily. I mounted it in a first floor closet where it now provides an excellent signal to the entire first and second floors (my base wireless router takes care of the family room floor in the basement).HOWEVER, I find that I constantly have to power it on and off to get my portables back online when they have been ""asleep"" for awhile - so frequntly that I installed a power bar in the closet just so I wouldn't have to unplug the Access Point to reboot it. None of the standard approches to ""fix"" the connection from the computers themselves works. One portable is an IBM using XP while the other is an HP using Vista, so it's apparently not an operating system or hardware issue. Besides these same computers did not have this problem connecting to my base router (also a Lynksys, although older), before I bought the Access Point."
2,WAP54G SUCKS,CANT ADJUST OUT PUT TRANSMIT POWER. DROPS SIGNALS. DOES NOT REACH THE 150 FEET THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 40 FEET..
1,Linksys Wap54G Wireless access point,Orininal product never workedI was sent a new unitIt worked onceI still have a unit that does not work
3,Bad pricing segment,"ok AP if you just want a transparent access point on your home network or SOHO. Because it is transparent I don't think the price was right, it should be $20 bucks or less. I would highly recommend purchasing the router/firewall AP version which is better value for the money."
4,Accessing the WAP54G from a Mac,"I have an ethernet home-network connecting the Internet to my office and my wife's. I wanted to add a wireless access point to my office so we could use a WiFi radio in the kitchen. I was ready to return the WAP54G to Amazon when I read only Windows requirements on the box. Moreover, the ""Setup Wizard CD"" inside the box is completely useless to any Macintosh person, and Lynksys provides no written information about how to communicate with the WAP54G from a Mac.Fortunately the WAP54G support page ""http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support/WAP54G"" came to my rescue. I was able to set up my WAP54G easily using their ""Accessing the Access Point's Web-Based Setup Page Using Mac"" instructions. And my new Squeezebox Boom radio sounds great in the kitchen.Linksys WAP54G Wireless-G Access Point"
4,works fine,"I already had a Linksys 54G router in the basement, and I added this access point upstairs to give better coverage for my iPhone. I used a hard-wired connection between the router and the access point. Ithen set the access point to a different channel, and the whole setup seems to work fine."
3,"works great, zippy, but software can't do Windows Vista","This product is advertised as Vista-compatible. Apparently that means only that Vista machines can talk 802.11 to it. But the configuration app that comes with the access point won't install on Vista. Vista has been out for a long time so that is really disappointing. Fortunately I have an XP machine and had no trouble setting this up via XP, works great & I appreciate all the different forms of security that it supports since WEP is really weak."
5,Great access point with updated functions,"This access point is fast and performs well in a wide area. Additionally Linksys just updated the firmware so the device can now act as a repeater on the same network (e.g., doesn't have to be connected via ethernet cable)to expand a network."
1,Will not work in repeater mode,Spent a day trying to get it to work in repeater mode to no avail. Linksys tech support helped me to get it working for ten minutes. This is complete junk. I am returning it.
5,THIS IS NOT A ROUTER!!!,"THIS IS NOT A ROUTER, IT IS AN ACCESS POINT. LOOKING FOR SECURITY IN A ROUTER? BUY A ROUTER! THIS IS JUST A ACCESS POINT TO EXTEND WIRELESS RANGE INSIDE A BUILDING. IT HAS NO SECURITY WITH IT IT USES THE ROUTERS SECURITIES.FIRST TIME BUYING LOOKING FOR A ROUTER? THIS IS NOT A ROUTER. IF YOU DO USE THIS AS A ROUTER, YOUR NEIGHBORS CAN USE YOUR INTERNET THAT YOU PAY FOR! THEY CAN USE YOURS FOR FREE WITHOUT YOU EVER KNOWING!!"
1,Don't buy this!!,"This product is at the bleeding edge. I have spent HOURS on hold trying to reach Linksys tech support, spent more time talking to their first level support then gotcut off after reaching second level support. They were never able to help me get it working."
3,Imporant bit of info left out,"I bought two of these trying to connect two wired networks, rather than run 200 feet of cable. I was mislead by the box which states you can combine two of them to connect two wired networks. I spent a couple hours trying to get it to work and found this on the internet:""An important point to note (and the source of some confusion) is that most Access Points cannot communicate with each other wirelessly. ""I guess I need a bridge for this to work. Other than that it seems like it is a good product."
5,"works flawlessly as a bridge, Access Point, and Access Point Client","I bought two -- the second one after realizing that one will not work as a bridge. It plugs into the Linksys Cable Gateway in one room, and to a 5-port switch in the other room. Nothing more to say -- follow the instructions and it will work as advertised.Update Jan 2009. I reconfigured the two as an Access Point/Access Point Client pair, and the access point is now my main wireless transmitter. It has a great signal through the house, and I hope that it will eliminate the problems with the WCG200 Gateway wireless feature(which I disabled)."
1,Do not buy from Cisco or Linksys unless you want Voice Mail Hell!,"I called Cisco/Linksys tech support. Someone told me I had called the wrong number. I called the new number and got someone who said none of the right tech support people had been available, so I had been routed to the wrong place but some of the right ones were now available so I should call back. I did call back and got someone who said I was still at the wrong place but she would put me through to the right place. I waited on line for 8 minutes, being assured that an engineer would be with me. But then the line went dead. I called back again, waited 8 minutes, the line went dead. I called back again and asked for a supervisor, but after being on hold for 10 minutes, I hung up. Then I bought Netgear equipment, called tech support, was put through right away to a very helpful person."
5,The perfect addition to my home network.,"Being ""wired oriented"", I didnt need wireless until I purchased a personal laptop to replace my work laptop when I retired. This item has performed flawlessly and I would recomend it as an easy way to extend a wired home network."
3,Great Access Point. Doesn't hold a signal for very long,"Once the data is extreme, such as the data rate of today's standard, it freezes up and you don't have Internet anymore. Put in more money and get an updated unit."
3,"Very,very,very POOR instructions--good performance",Instructions were not complete; TECH support was useless; has to pay for a GEEK to install; works fine after I paid $120+ to install the device.
2,Incompatible with other vendors; poor signal quality,"This is my second disappointment with Linksys products.I have purchased this AP to use in AP client mode connected to my Netgear WGR614 wireless router. The product comes with no user manual or technical specifications sheet. After spending some time trying to set up connection I have found user manual on Linksys web site, and discovered that AP client (as well as AP repeater) modes are supported only with another Linksys Access Point. It's not compatible with other vendor's products.When I tried to use it in Access Point mode, the signal was 2-3 times weaker then my old Netgear's.I am getting Very Good to Excellent signal quality from Netgear WGR614 (36-54 Mbps) and Good to Very Good (11 to 24 Mbps) from WAP54G..."
3,OK,"This was an ok product.. it didn't live up to my specifications, i was under the impression that it would repeat the signal much further than it did. I needed to expand my range by 500 feet it only expanded it by 150feet."
2,has some bugs...,"This works ok but my onw quam is that it will now work woth my i paq 5455 on 802.11b. It seems to have some issues there. It is a known bug. that some b equipnment may not work with it. htere are some people that hacked it to make it b only and the stuff works, but that is not a normal option in the menu."
1,LOUSY Tech Support,"I called the ""No-Help"" line after running into a minor issue with the WAP54G that I was setting up as a repeater. The individual who ""assisted"" me was worse than anything I could do alone. After I got off the phone, over 2 hours later, my laptop could not even connect to the wireless network at home. This individual would not pay attention to anything I said, instead seeming to read off a script. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, he said he was the floor supervisor.IF you buy this product, search the help section on their website for articles. Because if you have to call their ""no-help"" line you are in for trouble.Work on it yourself or find a store that will come out and set it up for you instead. Linksys tech support = worthless!!! The lack of adequate tech support is the main reason for the poor rating."
4,very good WAP,"I have recently purchased your WAP54G. I did so becuase I have used other products like your 4 port BEFSR41 router/hub and it has worked great. Installation was a problem. I tried to install on a hardwired computer on the network with WinME OS. It didn't detect the access point. But I called and got a rep in less than 2 min and I had WEP installed and turned out the WAP was actually working with no installation at all. I popped the wireless notebook card (WPC54G) into my notebook with WinXP OS and again in less than 5 minutes, it was working. The hardest part of the install of a wireless network using your devices was actually typing in the WEP encryption key. I am very impressed. Total time to install a workign wireless network, less than 10 minutes. Hard to beat that. You won't get 54 MBPS though. Still very very fast. No problem with online games etc.."
2,Flaky configuration.,My company owns several of these units. When configuring them it always feels like it's on a wing and a prayer. Often configs don't take and have to be reentered. One unit in our Philadelphia location has continued to loose it's configs and resets to defaults. Owned by Cisco but not as reliable as a true Cisco device.
2,Good Access Point if you know all restrictions,"I bought this product after I moved to a bigger place and needed a Access Point to widen the signal range. After setting it up, I realized there were a few things I wasn't aware.1. The device must be physically connected to your existing router (so it's not totally 'wireless') to be used as Access Point.2. If you want the device to be completely wireless, it needs to be configured as Wireless Repeater.3. To use it as Wireless Repeater the model of the existing router you have must be WRT54G. (not WRT54GC, WRT54G2, WRT54GS, etc.)After spending hours on chatting with Linksys support (apparently she wasn't even aware some of these restrictions) we found out this device won't work with my router so I decided to return it."
1,"One ""no"" vote","I wish this device could feel pain. It certainly has caused me hours of grief. When you set the password in the setup tool, it may or may not correctly allow you to long in through the web page administration. I'm now configuring it to work as a bridge connecting to my new wireless router. I can't do that, because it won't set the password correctly. I've only been trying for a couple hours, though. So very, very frustrated. It's worked before, so eventually, it will probably work again. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
3,"Quality issues, but good performance","I received one of these DOA -- actually, it appeared to have been a customer return that had just been reboxed and shipped back out the door! I replaced it with one purchased locally, and after a few minutes' setup time, the thing has performed very reliably, as reliably as the 802.11b unit it replaced. Might be worth getting the signal booster or an aftermarket antenna, but I have no problem pulling a good signal from my WAP in the basement to the 2nd floor of my house. Price has been reduced recently, making it an even better deal."
2,Backwards compability is a joke,"CNet reviewed it and found that, if you had any 802.11b clients, the access point forced everybody into 802.11b mode. I'm not touching this puppy until it can have b and g running simultaneously (just like having 10Mbps and 100Mbps devices hooked up to the same Ethernet switch). It ought to be possible, after all, even if it has to run them on separate radio channels."
2,Buy the AirPort Extreme instead,"Connecting a single 802.11b client drops the entire network to 802.11b speed, according to CNet's review of the item (which another person here mentioned). That's disappointing, to say the least. Most people buying 802.11g probably have some 802.11b equipment already. So without the ability to support mixed networks well, this is just an overpriced 802.11b access point.In contrast, an AirPort Extreme base station will continue to give 802.11g cards faster connections than 802.11b ones, according to Apple's knowledgebase document 107372. This difference is more than enough to justify the AirPort Extreme base station's higher price."
1,Buy anything but this...,"The WAP54G has been nothing but frustrating...which is compounded by the utter futility of trying to get tech support out of Linksys.Here's the big warning: these access points are evidently subject to a (albeit infrequent) problem: they randomly reset SSID and security. This does, of course, tend to render them entirely useless in most situations. It's possible that there's some way to fix this, but while I found reference to the problem via Y! Search, I couldn't find anything on Linksys' useless support site...and didn't find any solutions on the Web, either.I plan to try to send it back to get my $70 back...but I don't imagine I'll get the hours of frustration or lack of productivity back. Please give me the satisfaction of knowing that I helped save you from the frustration though: don't buy this and rate my review helpful to let me know I helped!"
1,Access Point reset to default settings with out any reason!!!!,"This product seems good but it have a big problem, I bought two access poitns of this model for creating bridge.they works fine, but after of 2 weeks suddenly the communications cut, when I review the access point configuration it was in the default configuration, the system self reset to the deafult settings, this is a common problem in this brand, this is a really big problemBad product!!!!"
3,"OK product, incomplete setup documentation","The setup documentation is valid only if your DHCP serves addresses beginning with 192.168.1.xxx! This was not stated in the documentation, so it took me some time to guess that the Documentation effort was outsourced, and I'd need to resolve the issue myself.Advice: Most casual users will have their internal IP addresses set to 192.168.1.xxx, but if this is NOT your case, you must change the ""default ip address of 198.168.1.245"" that is pre-configured in the WAP54G to something compatible with our network. -- In order to accomplish this step, you will need to temporarily reconfigure some PC/laptop to a compatible IP address for communicating with the Linksys (such as 192.168.1.004), then with the linksys cabled to that PC, you can run the LinkSys setup and reconfigure the IP address range."
1,Steered wrong by Linksys,"Product was purchased at the direction of Linksys to extend coverage to an existing Linksys (wrt54gx4) network in my home. Unable to achieve internet connectivity after installing and connecting to the product, Linksys reversed their claim that this product was compatible with my existing network. I returned it."
3,Certainly wasn't magical ... but it does work,"I upgraded from an old 802.11b wap11 which I bought about 6 years ago. Considering this is NEW technology, it didn't do much more than my 6 year old wap11. I thought the upgrade from b to g was going to be mind blowing. The only thing that was mind blowing was my waste of time to determine why there wasn't as much gain as I thought there would be. The connection says FULL, 54m ... however it doesn't SEEM faster. (perception versus reality)."
3,"Pretty good, I guess.....","If you are new to Photoshop, this book is a pretty good place to start. Carla Rose takes care to explain all of Photoshop's tools in detail. But I thought the tutorials were written very badly. After downloading the images from her website with the understanding that they would be used for the tutorials, I found that the images that she did use for her tutorials weren't the ones that she told us to download so I ended up not being able to follow along with her examples. If you don't care about using tutorials and just want to learn the basics, then this book will be good for you."
2,Weak and fluffy,"If you want a book that gets to the point of using Photoshop or want a reference book for Photoshop, stay away. The Adobe classroom in a book series is far superior."
3,"Good story, terrible production quality","In this volume, some interesting stuff happens. Bloodberry plans an elaborate date with Otaru, but she runs off and joins the circus when Lime shows up to accompany them. Cherry finds a lost baby and learns the joys of motherhood. After that, Otaru and the girls sneak Lorelei out of the castle to go out for a picnic. On the outing, Lorelei is kidnapped. The new enemy will surprise you.I'm loving the direction of the story in J to X, but the production quality of this season is awful. The character designs are ugly, the voice acting is bad, and the details are less impressive than in the 1st season and OVA. Cherry is really the only tolerable character. Most of the time, I can get used to slack animation. In this case, however, it's some of the worst I've ever seen. I recommend renting or watching J to X online before buying it."
5,Great!,"Episode 6 was SUCHA great and romantic episode! I mean, I didn't give respect to Bloodberry until that episode. It's so sweet! Episode 7 was very cute too, and I love the song there! Ep 8 portraits Cherry so well, and I love the baby! Ah, Kotaru is so cute! In short, it's a great DVD add to the rest ^^"
2,Can't believe they released this,"The bands are great, the music is fine, but Skynyrd's Ricky Medlocke can't be heard. He blisters his guitar, but you can't hear a bit of it. To me, this major screw-up totally ruined this concert footage. All I can say is I'm glad I got it for a gift and didn't spend any money on it. You shouldn't, either.(And I'm a Skynyrd fan from the beginning.)"
4,Where's the rest of 38. Special? They still rock though!,"This dvd of Lynyrd Skynyrd & 38 Special is a must have,though it's understandable that Skynyrd has a new lineup,Whatever happened to the rest of the original members of 38 Special? I miss that great guitar sound of Jeff Carlisi & I've noticed that there are other new band members in this group as well, Whatever happened to the original 38 Special? There's only about 4 originals & I know that there was more than that back in the days!"
4,"LYNYRD SKYNYRD & .38 SPECIAL ""DOUBLE BILL"" DVD","You get 7 songs from the Lynyrd Skynyrd ""Live from Steel Towm"" DVD:1.Whats your Name?2.You Got that Right3.I Know a Little4.Gimme 3 Steps5.Sweet Home Alabama6.Travelin' Man (With Ronnie singing along with Johnny)7.FreebirdYOU get .38 Special from the ""Live from Sturgis"" DVD:1.Rockin' into the Night2.Back where we belong3.Wild Eyed Southern Boys4.If I'd been the One5.Fantasy Girl6.Caught up in YOu7.Hold on Loosely.It's a great ""double bill"", the Skynyrd ""Live from Steel town"" DVD has been discontinued so this is the next best thing. thanks!!!"
4,Jarillo presents interesting ideas,"In strategic networks, Jarillo uses transaction cost economics in order to illustrate how networked organisations can achieve a competitive advantage. His ideas are interesting, but I think most readers should first read his seminal journal article on the subject, before deciding to by this book."
1,POOPSTIX!,"This was utter and total crap. Don't waste your money on this. No one should care about Hammy or his ""jolly"" adventures. They are beyond lame and no one should be forced to endure the painful retardation of this film.THE END."
3,Good blades but...,The blades are great but the problem is the only handles to use them with are absurdly expensive and yet grossly ineffective. Add to that the blades are very difficult to get out of their packaging and similarly difficult to attach to the handle mechanism. So not the best purchase I've ever made but it's hard to blame it on the blades when most of these problems could be solved by a better handle mechanism.
4,I bought this for my older dog..,"I noticed my dog was stiff and achy in the mornings... soI bought this size, cut it in half and added it to the rectangular shaped dog bed I have. I justunzipped and stuck the two pieces in. I then laid down on his bed, to see how it felt....and it isquite comfy and supportive. I think he likes it and I believe he rests more comfortably at night.I am satisfied with this product."
3,Not as advertised.,"Product was advertised 33x72x3 inches. It was rolled up so tightly that it was horribly deformed. When unrolled and left alone for hours, it never did return to any semblance of what the product should look like. After allowing the product some time to relax and reshape, it actually measured 33x64x1.5 inches. It may have been 3 inches thick before it was rolled up. But I can't imagine that being rolled too tightly caused it to lose 8 inches in length. It's probable that it was both labelled wrongly and packaged incorrectly for shipment."
1,Good for first few days,Got this for husband. It was fine for a few days then broke down and has hump in middle ech time he moves the bed up or down.
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered what I thought was a 4 inch mattress pad. What I got was 2 inch. I work at a hospital and I know what a 4 inch pad looks like. I am not satisfied with this purchase.
2,eggcrate mattress pad,The pad itself is very thick and good quality but the smell made me remove it from my bed.
1,Don't fall for it,"It may LOOK great but the twin pad is so light I could pick it up with 1 hand. And 4 inches is a joke!!! Even if you pull one of the pencil-thin points up an measure from the thickest part of the pad you won't find 4 inches! Back away from this one quickly!! Trust me, from someone who fell for it, you DON'T want it!!!!"
4,It did lots of good and we use it smooth side up,"This bad definitely FORCED our backs into position and after two nights and getting up in the morning crackling, our backs was amazingly better. After a week, no lower back pain. Unbelievable. I took the pad off and the pain started again. Pad back on. My mother suggested I flip pad to the smooth side because the cones were too aggressive for my back. Pad still works very good. It also helps me not suffer from sweat so much. I am dry on pad side. Menopause. I put a one inch mattress cover on top of the 2 inch foam pad. We don't toss and turn anymore at night. Very good product. Excellent price. bought another for sister and her husband."
5,saved me from buying a new mattress,"I love my new eggcrate mattress! I've slept on one for years and this was replacement. Highly recommend! It was sent in a very timely manner and it feels so soft, yet supports my aching back. I'm a nurse and when I finally go to bed I need some comfort for myself :)"
2,Inconsistent quality,"After reading the existing reviews, we decided to purchase anyway. It didn't lay flat when we took it out of the package, but has settled now.The problem is this: in several places they ""sliced"" the foam so thin that we actually have holes in it.It was comfortable to sleep on. But this manufacturer and company need some quality control. My guess is that what Amazon is shipping are ""factory seconds"" -- because they're counting on customers not sending their defective product back."
2,Disappointed,"This pad was advertised as being 4 inches thick. At the very most, it was 3 inches at the furthest tip (and that is being generous). After being used for about 2 weeks, it is already breaking down and flattening further. Very disappointed."
4,Just what I ordered,shipped quickly and was what I wanted. Noticed improvement from my last egg crate topper. It was a little misshaped in one area from shipping and would not lie down flat for a couple of weeks.
3,Eh,"The foam has a smell for a day or two, I suggest airing it out a bit before using it. I used my foam for cheap sound insulation, it works well for dampening the sound. I would like to warn those who plan to use it for sound insulation, this material is highly flammable, if you're a smoker you might want to explore some other products.Pros: CheapCons: Egg create cones are not uniform. Density of foam is not uniform."
4,Foam pad review,I've not used the item yet. It's purpose is to serve as an improvised bed for travel around the country. It should be adequate to the purpose (although I would have appreciated being able to find a thicker version).
2,Hotter 'n blazes!,"This pad absorbs your body heat and just roasts you the entire night. It is, without a doubt, the hottest pad (egg crate or otherwise) I have ever slept on. If it weren't for that, it would be fine. It's a little too firm for my comfort but I think some people will find that a plus. However the heat factor is just a nightmare."
1,Pointy flat pad,"There are few products that I would give as low as this product. It is not an egg-crate texture that I envisioned, but a spiky one with thin spikes that do not have any substance or firmness. It easily squishes to about 1/4"" thick. No support that I can find with this poorly designed product. If you want support, thickness do not buy this product. Too bad you can't return once opened. I can't think of any possible use."
3,Guitarist Gary Pihl comments on Day Blindness,"I'm amazed that this album is still around. The biography is little wrong, it goes like this: the band is Dave Mitchell on drums and Felix Bria on organ and bass and myself on guitar and vocals (except House and a Dog). Felix used a Vox Continental and Fender Rhodes Bass similar to the Doors, whom we admired. We were about 18 at the time and it was our first album. Tom Pruess, our manager, started Studio 10 Records and was the engineer and producer of the album. The album got a kind review from pioneer rock critic Ralph Gleason in the San Francisco Chronicle. That was a great time to be living in the Bay Area."
2,Not sure why I finished this book...,"This book was certifiably mediocre - not bad enough to stop reading, but not good enough to actually like. The character development, for the most part, is extremely limited, so you never really connect with anyone. You can tell that you're supposed to connect with the narrator, but the quality of writing just isn't there. The book simply reads as a series of events in the life of a young woman, because there is no ""life"" in this book. I found the resolution at the end of the book to be almost fantastical. The author did her research with regard to suffragettes of the era, but gave the reader no concrete way to identify with the cause. Sometimes I wonder how books this mediocre get published!"
4,very pleasant,"the black stallion: a masterpiece! (rate: 5)chitty chitty bang bang: my children appreciated it very much (rate: 3)yours, mine and ours: very nice for the whole family (rate: 4)"
1,Shoddy Research Methods,"How outraged and disgusted I am that a writer could behave with the lack of integrity this author has. No matter what her opinion on FMS is, lying to and manipulating survivors to get their stories is unconscionable and must surely bring the rest of the work under suspicion.Those who want to have a look at the questionable background of the FMS and some of its chief supporters would do well to read Charles L. Whitfield's ""Memory and Abuse""."
2,NOT the best review on the subject,"The bias of the author is so strong towards the FMS side, she unquestionly quotes FMS proponents rather than try to maintain a moderate stance and assess both sides of the controversy. I do not recommend this book. It is not well researched, it is more propaganda than critique. I DO recommend Memory, Trauma Treatment, and the Law, just out this year and a very thorough and fair look at the issues."
3,Er...well written?,"This book is...how should I put it...pretty lame.All of the settings, information, and clues make sense. The problem is, this could never have happened. To use all of your writing skills and the best information you can get to create...this...is surely a waste of time. Needs some minor revisions.Blue Balliet can do better.I know she can.Right?"
4,Good,The product came in a timely fashion - it wasn't needed immediately so there was never a problem with delivery. The product was in good shape and came packaged well.
5,Fantastic,"The students in my class enjoyed it ! They could not put it down and I enjoyed reading it, too !"
5,young adult suspense,Thriller involving a house by Frank Lloyd Wright and three young teen detectives who save the structure from being demolished by greedy crooks. The book also points up the importance of good and imaginative teachers.
2,Too bulky and stiff,"This is a good joystick if you like to play with the controller on a desk. But I like to hold the controller in my lap. The base is too thick to be held comfortably. My left hand gets sore almost immediately. Also, the rubber rings around the stick make the resistance too high especially if you hold the base in your lap. Also, the buttons aren't badly positioned but I still prefer the layout for buttons on the Gravis Blackhawk. The Thrustmaster forces me to use a pinky finger for button number four. I prefer the Blackhawk because I can use a finger on my other hand for the fourth button. The only thing I like about the Thrustmaster when compared to the Blackhawk is the inclusion of a Point of View hat."
1,This Joystick is Crap! Do not buy!!,I warn you not to buy this product because it is very [bad]. It has a hardware fault in it so that after some hours of use it will develop a problem so that when you move it in a direction for the first half of your movement it will go the other way. This is very annoying and Thrustmaster is denying the whole thing even though more that 1 people have experenced this problem. There is no way to fix it. I think that [they] shoud not sell this product unless they like selling their customers faulty products. This is my opinion and you can do what you want.
2,Just buy the batteries.,"This will NOT work with non-""TV games"" brand game units. Though the plug fit the hole, it doesn't make contact on plug-n-play units like Genesis and Space Invaders.There is an adaptor to replace the battery plate, but the spring loaded mechinism is twitchy and hard to install without them popping. Again, will not fit non-""TV games"" units.If all TV games just had a simple ac adaptor plug, this would be useful, otherwise it is proprietary junk.Just take your stuff to Radio Shack and get a universal adaptor. 300-500ma 6v units is all you need. Don't let them sell you the bigger 6v 1000-1500ma unit. It won't hurt the game, but it's bigger and more expensive for power you won't need.This is going back. Such wasted potential."
3,TV adaptor,"I think this is a great idea and I am sure that there is someway to make it work. The only thing is that I can't figure out how to get it into the Jakks Video game I read the instructions and have a screw driver to fit but can't seem to get it to fit into the toy properly. So, I haven't been able to use it yet."
5,"Hold on, this guy is going places","An amazing artist with a far reaching and eclectic style. His songs reflect his roots which reach far into everything from acoustic folk to soul to jazz and funk. This is a storyteller whose words are as important as his music. He takes hold of you from the first playing, and the more you listen the more you find his melodies and lyrics stirring in your soul."
1,3000 watts my butt!,you get what you pay for with these amps. had 4 of these hooked up to a pair of audiobahn 12s. couldnt blow them!
1,Bad design,"After being thoroughly impressed with RPM and using many of their products I ordered this. It is a bad design to use aluminum with plastic or the composite they use. The aluminum cut right through the threads and after spending an hour and a half on just these carriers I could not get them to seat right. I will be contacting RPM directly about a replacement. I followed their instructions to a T and could not get this product to thread right. It is a lot of money for something that is so finicky. I love the concept behind them but I could not, no matter what get these to thread right. Very disappointed!"
1,Bad design,My experience is the same as the other two reviewers. VERY difficult to securely screw the provided aluminum disks into these plastic pieces to maintain correct wheel camber.
4,I watch a lot of basketball,I wish Rick's scouting report was still being published as I find it an extensive and insightful read into the abilities and career longevities of the players. This book and the others like it are just excellent.
2,Watch out for this album !,"I thought it would be great to have this album of Gillan performing at Webley, in their last show ever. However this album is worse then a bootleg ! The sound is really horrible. It's like listening to a world radio long wave band. The cover makes it a 2 star album. I know this album has been released by their former bass player John McCoy, who probably wants to earn something. I cannot believe Ian Gillan has given his permission for this heap of s**t !"
5,Something about Harlow,"Great,Great box set from WBA.I have never seen any of the movies in this box set,but put anyone of these movies on and you just cant help watching Jean Harlow on the screen.Harlow was not the greatest actor and her image was totally manufactured under the Hollywood System,but that indefinable thing,which made her a MGM superstar in the 1930s is still shining out of those images today.I also purchased the Amazon book ""Harlow in Hollywood"" which go hand in hand with the box set.Im Very happy with the quality and the price of this whole box set."
5,"""The Inside Scoop""","Yep, I ""borrowed"" the title. This really is a good one! I can't get over the amount of info they fit into this story! MY kids (ages 4 & 8) don't really follow the news cast line, but they love seeing the inside of their bloodstream, throat, etc. They watch this over and over..... My Mom even liked it enough to ask for her own copy!"
5,Inside Ralphie,"Wonderful learning tool about how your body works, i.e. my son hasn't stopped talking about white blood cells and how the Magic School Bus almost gets eaten because Ralphie's body thinks that it is a foreign body and tries to get rid of it! Strongly recommend - one of his favorite Magic School Bus movies!"
5,songs that say what we all feel sometime in our lives,This c d is very polished.all of the songs tell a story that we all have felt at one time or another.Also the vocals are pure and and the music and lyrics go together so well that the whole c d just flows from one song to the next.
5,Medicated Shampoo Seborreha Skin problems on pets,My dog had severe skin problems caused by Seborreha and the Vet sold me this product to clear it up plus some antibiotics and it made a big difference in her skin and also her fur started to grow back as well. I will continue to use this to get rid of the problem. She is an older dog and she needed it to wash an heal the scales from the skin problems. I was also told to use Dawn on her skin as well. It worked so good.I recommend this product and it is so much cheaper then the Vet charged me for.Thanks Amazon for making it so affordable.
5,Shampoo for sensitive skinned Soft coated Wheaten Terrier,"The shampoo that I previously used on my Dog has been discontinued for over a year (Sebolyt). After repeated failed attempts to acquire that shampoo, I ordered Sebolux . Upon using several other shampoos that made my dog's skin worse or no better (he had raw spots & scabbing), I ordered 3 bottles of the Sebolux. This shampoo has made a big improvement in my Soft coated Wheaten Terrier's skin condition & was also endorsed by my vet. Will continue to order & would like to be able to order in gallon quantities."
1,Try another product.....,"Frankly I'm disapointed in the product. Usually you can trust Sony but not in this case. The unit is horrible at playing mp3's and they did not even include a pause function. I would check others in the line out careful as they may have the same ""engineering""."
4,Definitely Worth It For Any Charlie Barnet Fan,"I was never familiar with the Showcase broadcasts until I purchased this album. In fact, they don't appear to be documented in any of my Charlie Barnet discographies. But if you like the music produced by this band and its leader during the mid-1940's, this album is a must-have.From the crowd's cheers to the ""Redskin Rhumba"" intro on the first track, to the hardest-swinging version of ""Cherokee"" you will ever hear, finishing with an equally hard-swinging version of ""The Sergeant was Shy,"" and everything in-between, you will play this album frequently.The sound fidelity on this album is very good to excellent given the age of the source material. There are a couple of flaws in the recording, but it is unclear to me whether they were present in the original recordings or part of the mastering for this CD. Those few flaws nonetheless did not significantly detract from my enjoyment of this album."
3,Beautiful Quotes,"The book has various photos of gowns dating back in history and until now, some photos are more wedding snapshots. It has a little bit of history behind the wedding dress and what i found the most exciting was that on every second page was quotations about celebrating love and marriage. I found the quotations more interesting than the photos themselves."
2,A beginnes book,"I rate the book as being very good, but it could be better. It had nice style, but not quite what I was looking for."
1,Picture does not match what you get,"The pictures of these inter-office envelopes shows both the front and back of the envelope, and both sides show the ""Date, Deliver To, Department, Sent By and Department""; however, upon opening the box, only the front has the printing. This makes the back of the envelope useless. Very disappointed and I plan to return them."
2,Disappointed,"I was practically salivating when I saw Robbins had a new book out and ordered it the day it was released. There are a few interesting passages, but for the most part it drags. Badly. I hope he has fresh ideas for his next book; I certainly won't be rushing to buy it before I've had a chance to look it over first."
1,Save Your $$$,"Typically, I go into depression after I finish a Robbins book because I know it will be years before the next. So, as soon as I saw this appear I rushed to order it.If there was a zero star rating here at Amazon, this would be too high. After 75 pages I put the book down...........Mr. Robbins, are you so hard up for money? To say this is book is pathetic is too good - shame on you for letting your fans down (way down)!"
3,Hard to believe they couldn't find more interesting stuff on TR's hard drive.,"I'm not a fan of short stories. I'm less of a fan of gathering together a bunch of old articles and selling them as a book. I am, however, a huge fan of Tom Robbins.While it was good to read some Tom again, I can't say I was tremendously impressed by this selection of ""short writings."" Personally, in terms of cleaning out a hard drive and putting it in novel form, I much prefer Douglas Adams,The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last TimeI did enjoy some of Tom's poetry, and the homage to the Doors but other than that, the material was seriously dated.Hopefully there will be a new novel soon. I miss him. And these last two forays (this andVilla Incognito) have left me wanting."
4,If you expected another novel - this ain't it!,"Tom Robbins' short fiction runs the gamut: from sexy and delicious to somewhat dated and irrelevant. It's a collection that spans more than 30 years, and as such is indispensible to any hard-core Robbins fan. His inimitable style is all there, but the feeling of deep satisfaction one derives from reading one of his crazy novels is missing."
3,Audio Book Version,"I found this audio book to be a sort of resume/autobiography/reunion. Tom himself read the material, and it was fun listening to him ramble on, especially so whenever recalling his personal life experiences (even the rather dry areas I hadn't any interest in). In typical Tom style, he was well aware that there were segments in his book that might not be of interest to some, so he welcomed the listener to press fast forward! That being said, if I had purchased a hard/soft copy of this book, I'd have to say I would have been disappointed. Without hearing Tom's voice/emotion, my interest would have putter out."
2,Skip It,"I read everything that Tom Robbins writes. Until I read this, I loved everything he wrote. This is a compilation of some pretty boring stuff. Read the novels. Skip this."
2,Phfffft....RIP Tommy's muse--the 'ol boy has outlived his talent.,"sorely disappointing...hope it's not failing health.must've been lubricating his keyboard with really ripe bong-water to have fallen in this heap...well, RIP Tommy's muse--and sincere thanks for taking us along on all the fun, past romps. --jm"
2,Not typical Robbins,"Though by no means a bad read, this book is by no means as rollicking and fun as what one might expect from reading other Robbins' books. A compilation of his shorter writings for magazines or other sources, it lacks a lot of what I love him for."
5,Classic Tom Robbins writing,"Having read the Robbins classics: Cowgirls, Another Roadside attraction, Still Life etc this was quite the treat. The short essays are excellent. Makes me long for another novel...."
4,Robbins can do no rong,"I cannot offer an objective review of this fellows book or books. He had me from hello over 25 years ago. He has evolved over the years and this book is further proof. As usual his paragraphs and pages are carefully constructed. He is funny and witty without being clever. If this book doesn't make you think, well, then your sleeping thru it."
2,Pad Saver Problematic,The pad saver looks like a good idea. One would suppose it would absorb excess moisture that would be dissipated and it would therefore keep the pads dry and uniform. My experience suggest that the lower stack pads (rear edge) or closest to the hinge actually comes in contact the material on the pad saver and cause the pad to perhaps shrink. Inserting a leak light into the body tube of the horn seems to confirms this inasmuch as light can be seen at the rear edge of the pad with the key closed and the pad doesn't seal fully against the tone hole.
1,Expensive purchase,I purchased this Brubeck CD for $32 and put it in the car CD player. It didn't play and it would not eject. Now I have to have the CD player removed and repaired.Thanks alot!
5,Helped with a sensitive cat,"I have a long haired cat that is very sensitive to fleas and will rip his hair out around his tail, up his spine, and front of his ears by licking and over gromming the areas. He seems to do this twice a year when the weather changes. He will also get the scabbing and bumps. I am unable to find any fleas on him but I will apply flea treatment (advantage II) and I will use this spray on him. He is terrified the the spray sound so i put some in my hand and rub it into the areas. This stopped him from tearing his hair out and he had no side effects from it. It seems to be a winning combination for this cat. It has a pleasant smell too that is not offensive."
2,Does what exactly?,"Aside from a slightly moist mutt with a fairly pleasant odor, I don't see what this is doing for my dawg as a body spray; she scratched before and she still scratches afterwards. Some online write-up also talked me into putting this into her ears which, I'm embarrassed to say, was just dumb. Adding wet didn't cure wet, go figure."
4,so far so good,"It might still be too early, but I think this product might be very good. I've tried it so far on my dog who has bad itchy flaky skin and his skin seems to have improved. I will continue to use it. Seems like a fairly good product compared to the dozens I've tried."
2,Did not enjoy this book,"I was on a real Loretta Chase kick, and read many of her books in a row. This was the one that actually soured me on reading at all for a while. It wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't a good book. The characters were dull, and I did not find any of them likable at all. The story was all over the place, and I am still not sure what happened. The setting was unclear, and there were a lot of really strange plot elements. If you are looking for a great book by Loretta Chase, this is not it."
4,A delicious main man,"I really enjoyed the main characters, they were well written and really meant for one another. Basil is a rogue and our h is feisty and a good match for him. I loved the way things played out and I enjoyed the crafty way Basil got both of them out of their difficult situation i.e. her betrothal to a man her father had chosen for her. The secondary characters were delightful too."
4,Chi Town Punk-Rock,"This is a great album. I had the opportunity to see this band in Denton, TX, and they rocked. I bought the CD at the show and it has maintained steady rotation on my stereo.This isn't just generico punk, it is good music. The band is tight, the tunes are quick and catchy, but not over-produced and poppy.There is even a song about the bad kid's dog from ""Where the Red Fern Grows."" The whole CD is packed (although pretty short, it is a punk album after all) with good tunes. If you like a good punk sound from an indie band, you will probably like this."
1,Poorly Made,"This toy lasted about 7 1/2 minutes in our home with my non-destructive four and a half year old, leaving him in tears. This was a present for him for being a good boy at home and getting through some rough days at a new preschool. The first thing that happened was that I had to replace the cheap batteries (no problem, we are used to that with toys these days). Then, the piston type thing that makes the bucket move kept popping off. Next, the thing just quit moving. We replaced the batteries again, and the ones we took out were so hot the thing must be a fire hazard. My son got so frustrated that he actually cried because the toy he had waited for was just a piece of junk. It is not worthy of the Tonka name. So, I have returned it to Toys 'R Us.com, but Note:: they will not refund the shipping and handling since it is not their fault. So I have paid around $10.00 for shipping and handling for a $15.00 broken toy. Happy I am not."
1,Tonka Motorized Bulldozer,"The first evening my son played with this, the battery went dead in less than an hour. It has no power and is not made very well. The tracks also come off. In addition, it must be on a smooth, completely flat surface to even move. It couldn't move over our bedspread and the bed was made. If it wasn't for shipping charges, I would have returned. Very disappointed."
3,Not body LOTION!,"My error! I purchased two of these body WASHes, thinking it was my favorite--Estee Lauder's Beyond Paradise body LOTION. It isn't. They aren't. And I'm disappointed. I'm kicking myself for not reading more carefully."
5,Great Read!,"A wonderful book. Full of facts and fun. Unlike many books I've bought, this one is a keeper for my library!"
2,disappointing...,"The book was a light read. The stories were interesting and give us a snapshot glimpse into the lives of other people. However, while the stories themselves were creatively simple, I felt the essence was lost in translation. I am from Kerala myself and I kept trying to imagine what each sentence would have sounded like in Malayalam since the translated version doesn't do it justice. Overall therefore, while I thought the stories were nice, I felt the translation could have been better and left me feeling disappointed."
5,MIND BLOWING,"THIS VIDEO IS BY FAR THE MOST POWERFUL SRV VIDEO'S OUT THERE. THE ATMOSPHERE IS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE WITH A SMALL CROWD IN A DIMMLY LIT BAR ROOM AND THIN HAZE OF CIGGARETE SMOKE, AND NOT MENTION STEVIE PLAYING BONE SHAKING RIFF'S THAT WOULD BRING ANY GUITAR ENTUSIAST TO THER KNEES. THE VIDEO QAULITY IS GOOD AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT BUT MOST IMPORTANT THE ENERGY IS INTINSCE. THIS IS A MUST BUY"
5,I really miss this guy!,"My husband and I rented this DVD to see if it was significantly better than our WHS copy to buy. The answer is yes! Although it doesn't have all the ""expected"" bells and whistles of a DVD, both the picture and sound quality are much better than the VHS copy we currently own. No, it's not perfect in every way like new DVDs are, but that's not why you listen to the blues. If you're like the TV character Nash Bridges and you ""still miss that guy"", you owe it to yourself to get this one."
5,5 Stars Aren't Enough!,"I'm an aspiring 17 year old blues guitarist, and I've been in love ith SRV's style, ever since I first heard him play. This video was the appitomy of Stevie.. I especially liked the part where he was going into a solo, and took his hat off (not missing a note), set it on the stand, and really went full force into the solo, he gave it everything he had, and then he put the hat back on his head, without missing a note! This movie is a MUST have, for any SRV fan! or SRV lover, such as myself! Enjoy!"
3,"Good, but not CLASSIC Stevie","Stevie was greatest in 1989 when he was sober....songs like ""Tightrope"" show that. IF you want a good SRV DVD, get ""Live in Austin, Texas"""
5,classic!!!!!!!,"This is one of his best shows captured for all to see. Stellar performance, Stevie at his best. No one can play Texas blues guitar like SRV. If you are a fan, this is a must have, if not you will be after witnessing this dynamic performer."
4,SRV Live at El Momambo,"If you've never saw SRV live, this is the closest thing to understanding why his fame grew. While raw, the sound is good and being able to watch him smoke the frets is amazing. SRV was at the top of his game at what he did...ENTERTAIN!!!!!!!!! Much better than the Austin City limits dvd in the box set."
5,inspired,"SRV is undeniably one of the great live bluesmen. What sets this DVD apart from every other concert is the camera. It is unique in that unlike many concerts you see the musicians actually playing their instruments! It is not just the lead singer's head and two crowd shots for an hour. This is a small club and it shows, the whole vibe as well as the sound is incredible. Any guitarist can learn a lot from this. I will never tire of this."
1,Terrible!,"I'm sorry, this book is an abomination! It makes a simple thing difficult. Students, prepare to suffer. This is one of the only SPARC books out there."
5,Great book to learn Assembly.,"This book discusses everything in detail that you need to know in order to learn Assembly and work with assembly.It even discusses and explains Assembly code that does exactly what some of the C Control Structure (for(), while(), etc) code looks like in assembly.This books contains two chapters that discuss different number systems as well as how adding, subtracting, multiplying, and division work with binary numbers including the Assembly code.Any one that wants to have a better grasp of how the machine actually runs your compile program or wants to write/read assembly should get this book."
2,Dense and Confusing,"I am a CSCI major, and am currently taking Assembly Language & Architecture. This text was required for the course. After opening it to the first chapter, I was assaulted by a grammatically poor and overall confusing overview of Assembly language...that used an HP Calculator to try and get the idea across. I don't know a single person who actually programs their HP calculator anymore. The remainder of the book does get better, but Tanenbaum explains the concepts a lot better in his Structured Computer Organization. I'd recommend staying away from this book unless it is required for a course, and then only buy it used or borrow it from another sap who actually bought it."
3,Paper is very low quality,"Given the rare technical SPARC books, I have to give the author some credit.The book includes some good background and thorough examples of SPARC stack, windows...etc.However, I found that the paper quality to be very bad. Given the price of the book ""100+"" you would expect a decent material in return.My coworker bought ""the same version"" of this book some years back and the paper quality was much better and the book stays in place when left on the desk opened.I ordered the book twice to make sure the one I had was a defected unit, but found that all of them are the same bad quality.I believe the book is way over priced for both the content and the quality of paper."
5,Colorado,"I boought this DVD Video ""Shipmates forever"" for a good friend who served on the USS Colorado Battleship in WW II. The Colorado was used in the film and I thought he would enjoy it. I viewed the film before giving it to him and enjoyed it very much. I have not talked to him since giving it to him and so I do not know what his reaction to it was."
4,Limited subject,I think the book is great for what it discuses but the problem was that even though the title Says modeling the M113 series it is primarily modern and Canadian equipment. So if your work on a Nam era Cav M113 this will be of no help.
2,Too simple.,"I like the fact that it contains the beautiful Tarot Classic deck. However, the book is too simple. Does not have any extra to add."
1,Dissapointed,The story is good - but the acting is soooooooooooo poor and it's soooooooooo slow - and then the ending doesn't wrap anything up. Our whole family adores Natalie Grant - and were really looking forward to this movie....we have a growing Christian movie library...........but this one was weak.
5,"didn't fit, but got a refund.","I bought these a long time ago, and wrote a negative review, as they would not fit in my wife's ears. They gave us a refund promptly and kindly apologized. I would do business with this company again, as they actually care about customer service. :)"
3,Live Revolution,"I've been a George Lynch fan since the Dokken days of the mid 80s. The CD recording is great on this, but on the DVD the vocal and guitar tracks are dubbed in. It sounds like the same recording for CD so what you're really getting is a live CD and DVD that were recorded in a studio. The lighting is bad on the DVD, so there are no real good shots of George's guitar solos. And the brief ones that you can catch actually display the fact that his fingers are playing something different than what you are hearing. So if you're looking for a great live DVD, you're not going to get it here. If you want some great re-recorded studio versions of these songs, you will like this."
2,Not Another Mafia-Oriented Book!,"Sigh. Does every mystery writer have to do a Mob-related story? I really love Susan Conant's Holly Winter books: I like the unconventional heroine, I love her malemutes, I like Steve Delaney, I like Kevin and Rita.I'm Italian, both sides. My dad's family comes from near Rome. Mom's family was from Ischia, off the coast of Naples. I have so much Italian blood that bread is my Friend, the scent of fresh spaghetti sends me into transports of joy, I drool at the thought of proscuitto. But I hate Mafia stories. I don't understand the interest in these criminals.I hope now that Ms. Conant has this peculiar mania out of her system we'll get an interesting book next time instead of this flirt with gangsters.P.S. Holly: For cryin' out loud, find a good home for your cat. If you have to keep him locked up in the study all day while you fuss over the dogs, you're doing him as much disservice as those dog owners you criticize who neglect their dogs."
3,Not up to Bosch standards.,"The frame of this filter is not as stiff as it needs to be (in comparison to the Wix filter that I used the last time), so it flexed quite a bit as I tried to stuff it in the tight slot. It eventually bent, to my dismay, but I did get it in there. This is installed in a 2002 Grand Caravan; as they say, your results may differ, especially if your filter is easier to replace. The filter medium itself appears to be the same type of felt material that's used in the Wix filter, which worked well."
1,Beware of sparks!!,"I recieved this dryer as a gift for Christmas a few years ago. My favorite collor is pink so of course I was excited.. new dryer - fun collor! I was pleased with the dryer for a while. I recently cut my hair short so I use it all the time now. And with it's frequent use... it started to spark. And I mean BIG sparks. I jokingly told my hair stylist about my experience with my dryer and he said that he noticed unusually short hairs in some places. It was burning my hair! He also said that he has heard of other people having the same experience with Revlon dryers. He told me that as many hair dryers as he has gone through in his profesional career, NONE of them have ever sparked.. just quit working. Which leads me to believe that this product is VERY dangerous! Don't be fooled by it's light weight and cute collor. It will burn you!"
3,"Hot, but no stamina",I had this hair dryer for a year before it fried out. The best thing about this dryer was it would get really hot and dried my thick hair in a decent amount of time. Truth be told I only bought it cause it was cheap and pink.
1,Just Terrible,I bought this because it was cute and other 1875 watt dryers seemed to do the trick before. This is just awful if you have thick hair. It is very weak and I can hear things popping inside.
5,Best Dryer,"We have had this for long long time, my wife uses this almost everyday and still works very good, she dropped the other day, and still works very good."
2,It Does Spark,"When it comes out of the box and I first start using it, the air is powerful but definitely not hot enough. So the more I have used it over some months of time the hotter it has gotten, which I really like. But the last few weeks I have noticed some sparking. Freaks me out a bit! I have been buying this brand for a while and my previous ones just shut down after about a year but this ones sparks. Time to buy another blow dryer I guess. Sparking from an appliance is never good."
1,Cute but cold!,"This blow dryer is cute, but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature. I gave up trying to dry my hair."
5,Good Replacement,"I replaced my old one with this dryer. My daughter has one like it and I love the amount of air produced. I have long, thick hair and drying it is a snap with this dryer."
1,NEVER WORKED,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY AUNT AS A GIFT. SHE WAS VERY EXCITED TO USE IT FOR THE 1ST TIME AND THE DAMN THING NEVER WORKED. SO I HAD TO GET THE DRYER BACK AND MAIL IT FOR A REFUND ...NOT HAPPY AT ALL
5,Great for such a low price!,"I've had this for about 3-4 months now and it still works great! I usually use it on the highest heat setting and it takes about 10-15 mins to dry my (shoulder length) hair completely. Its a little flimsy but not too bad, I don't imagine it would last more than a couple of years but since I only need it for a year of college it is perfect so far! Very happy with it"
4,everything pink,"bought this hairdryer for my daughter who ownes everything in pink. She loves it. It is light and has good airflow. She also pointed out that it is not very noisy and of course, the color is just right."
4,Great product,This product has drastically reduced the clutter of cables behind my desk. It's really easy to use. My only criticism is that there aren't enough tie wraps included.
3,Not delivered in display album as promised,"Product description says cards will be delivered in ""protective display album."" But they weren't. I received the cards in excellent condition, but they came lumped in a sandwich bag that was taped between two hard plastic plates, presumably to save the dealer on shipping costs, although there was a high shipping price attached to the item.Obviously, when one reads ""protective display album,"" one expects to see binder sheets with individual pockets. You can't ""display"" cards lumped together in a sandwich bag. Also, I'm no stickler about Mint condition, but once I remove the cards and put them in my own display sheets, their condition has degraded, even if slightly.The product is fine, and was delivered quickly, but given the high price of the cards and the shipping, having them delivered in a plastic bag, not the promised album, was disappointing."
5,3M 1870Surgical Mask N95,"This mask is great for all kinds of work. People with breathing problems while doing housework or outside work. Example Cutting the grass, Cleaning the garage,dusting and painting. Use this type for any kind of dust in the air.I am enjoying mine.Thank You"
4,Wanting More,"This is a great DVD mainly featuring interviews with Monk's friends and family, providing fascinating info about the man. However on my wish-list is a comprehensive DVD of Monk's performances (there seems to be plenty of footage) WITHOUT any talking over his playing!. I am much more interested in Monk's music than in the art of the video-editor.Classical musicians can expect all of their performances to be seen and heard, jazz on video should be treated the same. Particularily as watching Monk play live adds a great deal to appreciating his music, his timing, improvisational skills and generally pushing it to the edge !"
5,I love Monk and this video,"I've watched this three times and look forward to my next viewing again. Features interviews with many of his contemporaries including Billy Taylor, Marion White, Barry Harris and his son Thelonious Mon Jr., as well as lots of footage of the master himself playing. I'm a huge Monk fan, and I found this fascinating and very informative on what made this genius tick. Highly recommended."
4,When and who did it...,"Some of us actually like to know when a dvd (especially a documentary) was created and who did it... and for some reason no outlet, including Amazon, ever thinks it worth mentioning. What we get is the release date of the most recent packaging.So here it is:""THELONIOUS MONK; American Composer"" Toby Bryon/Multiprises in association with Taurus Films, Matthew Seig Director, Written by Quincy Troupe, c 1993, 60 minutes"
1,WHATS UP WITH SONY PICTURES???,I CANT GIVE ANY DVD MORE THAN 1 STAR WHEN ITS IN THE SQUARE FORMAT INSTEAD OF WIDESCREEN AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT TYPE OF SOUND IT HAS BECAUSE THERE IS NO MENTION OF IT. WHAT A CROC !!!!!!
1,The Mountain Men,"My husband and I were very disappointed with this movie. The best way to describe it is ""goofey"". I figured with big names like Charlton Heston and Brian Keith (and I'm a fan of both) that this would be a good movie, but it wasn't. Every other word out of Brian Keith was G-- D--- and I mean through the entire movie..well all that we watched anyway. If you want to watch a good mountain man movie, Jeremiah Johnson is the best.The quality of the DVD itself was great..it's just a bad movie."
2,Ok but not really as an action film,"I've always liked Charlton Heston and Brian Keith and I also love westerns. That being said, although the scenery was gorgeous, I just didn't enjoy the film that much because to be frank, at their ages in this movie, I didn't find the action scenes at all believable. I think had they done this same film at an earlier age (or if the film had been done with a bit younger actors as stars) then it would've been much different. Steven Macht, although not young in the movie, was very believable and still had an air of power and competence about him that certainly made me think he was a threat. ; Actually of the three actors, his acting was by far the best in my opinion!Also have to say I did not like seeing the horses flipped around in this movie as much as they were (flipped over their heads, on their sides, etc.)... I found this disturbing as some could've been easily hurt this way during filming."
2,Not what I expected,"The movie wasn't bad, just not what I was looking for. It was more of a comedy than anything. Language was a little rougher than I expected as well. I was looking for a good, laid back mountain man/indian movie with a good script and scenery."
3,UNFIT FOR FAMILY VIEWING,I was disappointed with the contents of this movie. The story was entertaining but the vulgarity and swearing was uncalled for. I am sure that the Mountain Men's language left little to be desired but I believe that in this movie it was not needed. There were a couple of sexual oriented scenes that made this movie unfit for family viewing. The era of the Mountain Men is a period in our history that we should be proud of and we should be able to share it with our families. It is hard for a parent to want our our kids to expierence the beautiful scenery and adventure of this movie and not be worried about the next scene. I own other movies of the Mountain Men era and this is the first one that I can truly say is not for family viewing.
1,An awful western.,"Beware! This film is terrible. The storyline and dialogue are ludicrous. The acting can be charitably described as wooden. The film is just one more ""white guys vs. the Indians"" psuedo-epic. Most of the Indians look like rejects from a Bonanza episode. Just a mess!"
1,What a Stinker,"If you are enamoured of the fur trade and mountainmen, then you might like this one. Heston and Keith have done better work, but it wasn't in this movie. I saw it when it first came out during the ""buckskinner"" craze and was underwhelmed. If you can't sleep at night, this one will certainly fill the bill. YAAAAAWWWWNNN"
3,Full Screen? What studio genius thought that up?,"A wonderful outdoor epic stuffed into a 1.33:1 format? What idiot from Columbia came up with that suggestion? This is a movie that NEEDS widescreen! It didn't do well at the box office because it was sold to the public as a zany comedy, which it is not. An accurate picture of the latter days of the fur trade with more than its share of delightful one-liners and action. Brian Keith shows how scene stealing should be done. This is a guys movie. Would have been 4 stars in widescreen, Columbia!"
1,1940's Technology,"This is one of the best under rated movies out there. Charlton Heston and Brian Keith are superb. I have been looking forward to it's release on DVD and how is it released? In fullscreen format. The film opened in widescreen and reverted to full screen at which point I turned it off. The great cinematography has been reduced by two thirds. If I wanted 1940's technology I would only buy films produced before wide screen was available. What is the matter with the studios who ruin good films by eliminating most of the scenery and the action? As I do not watch widescreen format reduced to ""fit my TV screen"" I intend to return this film, unwatched, to Amazon."
3,How The West Was Won,Although I enjoy the acting of Charlton Heston this DVD of the Mountain Men is not one of his Oscar winning performances. With that said it is still an enjoyable film with Brian Keith acting a part that is out of character from the usual roles he plays.I agree to a point with other reviews on the DVD about it effects lose from showing the nature scenes in full screen and not wide screen. I find what has been neglected in the reviews by others about the film is the struggle that is faced by all its characters. First the two mountain men are struggling with the decline of the fur industry and their future in it. Secondly the Native Americans are struggling with the White Man entering upon and changing their way of life. I feel by watching the DVD you get a chance to look at some of the problems that must have been faced by both sides during this period of change in American history.All in all an enjoyable DVD with a great perspective of how the West must have been won.
4,Sans Widescreen,"This is a great movie about Mountain Men but all the DVDs that I found were only in full screen format. Although widescreen is now fairly common with DVD releases, this one isn't. Good performances by Charleton Heston and Brian Keith (the two of them appeared togther in another western ""Arrowhead"" with the late Jack Palance). Still this is a good movie that will be sure to please."
5,Great frontier film!,"Charlton Heston and Brian Keith have great chemistry. This film is humorous and is a wonderful portrayal of life in frontier times! Like us, you'll watch it over and over again!!"
4,"great movie, very entertaining","I have seen the movie, but not the dvd yet, just got it today. i would have gave it 5 stars sight unseen if it was a widescreen version."
4,Mountain Men,"This is a great movie for the history and out door enthusiest,I just wish it was on DVD, because I have worn out my VHS version."
4,Good western,"This is a comic western with the old characters we recognized for their true grit and gruff manner. Two seasoned trappers try to get their beaver plews to the Rendezvous for trade without losing their scalps to the Crow or the very aggressive Blackfoot. There's also a greenhorn thrown in the mix with big ideas for future trade that the old timers find laughable, despite the shrinking market for beaver.The trail becomes even more treacherous when a squaw from the Blackfoot tribe that attacks them would rather stay with the two white trappers than return to her abusive husband. Heavy Eagle of the Blackfoot has no intention of allowing his women to run off with white men. His blood feud is spurred by pride rather than love for his wife, but he stops at nothing to get even with the trappers. The humor in the film was fun and something I feel is missing from some westerns. This movie is definitely a keeper for my Western collection of DVD's.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Baudy and Entertaining,"This show has a fairly good story line, fine acting and stunning scenery. I saw this show when it was first released and the one aspect of the picture that I think I loved the most is the dialect. This was the first time I ever heard 'Uncle Bill'(Brian Keith)swear! The movie might not be historically accurate, or maybe it is...I don't really know or care. I grew up in Wyoming, and the way Tyler and Frapp carry on as the grumpy, mangy, grizzled old farts that they are just seemed natural to me. The one scene when Tyler happens upon Frapp in the middle of a frozen lake(Tyler has written off Frapp after seeing him 'killed'and subsequently scalped by Indians) and remarks on the scalping ""Well, it sure must have smarted some""...Frapp agrees and displays a broad patch missing hair...Take me Bill Tyler..Take me!!! HEH!!!"
2,"A b-grade version of ""Jeremiah Johnson""(even though the storylines are totally different......)","This is a really dissapointing film overall. The film has the look of a cheezy 50's b-grade western but was filmed in the late 70's shortly after Robert Redford's classic ""Jeremiah Johnson"" was filmed. This film is obviously trying to ride the coat tails of that film and it shows in the overall b-grade presentation. The film score is about as hammy as it gets and the acting is simply atrocious, even from the main characters such as Charlton Heston. The native americans are protrayed very poorly here, they are just cookie cutter hollywood stereotypes that have nothing interesting aside from the lame action sequences. This is the sort of film that you would expect the guys from MST3K to be coining classic one-liners at, some of the parts are so bad it turns out to be absolutely hilarious and that is why I give it 2 stars."
5,great movie,"A pair of grizzled frontiersmen fight indians, guzzle liquor, and steal squaws in their search for a legendary valley 'so full of beaver that they jump right into your traps' in this fanciful adventureSome of Heston's better works.. forget the Apes.. get this instead!"
5,a fun ride,This film was a blast. Plenty of action and colorful language. The dialogue and visuals fit the time period well. Any fan of mountain man fiction should really enjoy this film. I enjoyed it much more than the Jeremiah Johnson film. It's hard to believe I didn't hear of this movie sooner.
5,"Story of Love, devotion and friendship",This movie will NEVER leave my collection again. This is one I can play over and over and all of the emotions I feel are fresh each time. This is a must see. A story of Friendship. A true story of Devoted Love. This story is truly endearing.
1,Not worth your money,"This book is ""BASIC"". Yes it gives you the basic 101 of P.I. but for $19.00 don't waste your money. I paid less for the complete idiots guide to private investigations and got so much more out of it. Danny Marshall should be investigated for stealing my $19.00. This book is 8"" X 5"" 54 pages with large text. I had this read cover to cover in about 30 mins. and I am a slow reader. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up just due to price. I would pay $5.00 for this book."
3,Celtic Short Stories!,"I am usually not a fan of short stories. I prefer the longer mystery novels where there is time to develop characters and to embellish plots, but these 15 short stories of Sister Fidelma are well worth the effort. Yes, there is a lot of repetition by way of introduction for each story, but they are intended to be stand-alone stories and not every reader may see all the stories or have read the Sister Fidelma novels. But the stories were interesting because they were set up in the order of creation, and we see Fidelma developing as she goes along. There is such an array of settings, crimes and motives for each story that it keeps the interest of the reader. The descriptions of the countryside in the various seasons were what I enjoyed the most. The last story in the book has the best description of a snow storm that I've read. If you're a Sister Fidelma fan, you really should take the time to read these stories. You will not be disappointed."
2,anachronistic,"I am still trying to finish this collection so I can move on to novels. In the first story, the author uses the word ""mesmerise"" 3 times. Dr. Anton Mesmer was not born for several centuries after Sister Fidelma. I find it more than annoying, as it is a big gap, and he is listed as an expert historian. I also find the conversations hard to believe. I will continue, though, and see if the Sister is more believeable by the end of the book."
3,Interesting series - except for the heroine,"The premise of this series is beguiling: Tremayne choose enlightened 7th C. Ireland with a young woman lawyer/religuese/sleuth as protagonist. And indeed it works for the most part except that Sister Fidelma is a patronising, antagonistic, humorless little prig.Hemlock at Vespers is a collection of short stories and Tremayne tries to soften Fidelma by, for example, repeating in EVERY story, usually by the second paragraph, how a few strands of rebellious red hair had escaped her headpiece. He even has her smile occasionally. But generally this woman is so stiff and obnoxious and difficult to like that it affected this reader's ablity to enjoy the collection.I've read most of the books in this series and recommend ""Death By Absolution"". In book format rather than short stories, Sister Fidelma's pungent presence is diluted by the other characters and historical events, and makes for much more fascinating reading than Hemlock at Vespers."
1,The Irish deserve better than Peter Tremayne,"As a church historian I found the work to be so factually flawed that any hope of an enjoyable mystery was crushed under a load of historical inaccurracy obviously fed by a desire to make 7th century Ireland amenable to 20th century feminists. In the first six pages I found so many skewed historical ""facts"" that I can honestly say the author has raised ""historical fiction"" to a new level i.e. prayers being repeated in the 6th century that were not written until the 13th century."
1,Offensive and politically incorrect,"I feel as though I have been victimized by a hate crime after reading Hemlock at Vespers. The short story, THE POISONED CHALICE is purposefully and demonically insulting to the Catholic faith. The murder weapon is the Most Blessed Blood of Christ which is blasphemy in itself. The character ""sister"" Fidelma is quoted as saying, ""It is, to my mind, a warning of the dangers of believing what was meant as symbolism is , in fact, a reality"" No greater insult can a Catholic imagine. Shame on you Peter Tremayne!"
3,Songs from Hawaii,This is a collection of Girl Scout songs that were recorded in HI. We only knew a couple of the selections. We are relitively new to Girl Scout Songs. At the end of the CD they included the music without the singing. The CD is done well - we just didn't know many of the songs.
5,Excellent for Massage,"As I'm a massage therapist, I'm constantly on the lookout for music that brings relaxation into my massage room and helps promote wellness. This album not only helps my clients, but helps me maintain a relaxed and grounded session. Very nice."
3,Heard Better,"This CD was okay, but have heard better. Nice and relaxing, but was looking for something more. None of my clients raved about it either."
1,Potential plot leads to awful book,"Podrug's ""Dark Passage"" has a plot that could lead to great things - going back in time to stop people from killing Jesus! The premise is that terrorists have used a secret US time device to go back in time to kill Jesus before he's crucified and the US sends in three people to stop them. At times it seems like the author would rather talk about sex than about the plot, as the sex pops up throughout this book. The suspense is mild as the three have 2 weeks to stop the terrorists. I won't ruin the ending for anyone still interested (even after reading all of these reviews), but I'll just say it was disappointing. After spending so much time talking about semi-pointless information, the author ends the book in such quick and unsatisfying fashion that you wonder if you read it all correctly. (I went back and re-read the ending, thinking ""That's it?""). Save your time, please. If you feel like you have to read it, go to a library and save yourself the money!"
2,Disapointing,Dark Passage contains all of the elements that should have made it a must read for beach goers this summer. Ultimately though the author leads his readers down a well traveled path who's ending disapoints rather that surprises. Anyone who has read Michael Moorcocks Behold Man will recognize the ending with but a small twist to seperated the two.If the ending had been more original Mr. Podrug would have deserved a slightly higher rating possibly three stars. While some of his characters are mere cardboard cutouts IE: the mad general and the terrorists. The three main characters do stand well on their own especially Marie and David Ben-Dor.Overall this book was a two star read that with a little originality could have been much more.
2,Extremely Disappointing Ending,"I was looking forward to reading this book. Mr Podrug seems to have an excellent nack for painting a visual picture of exotic locations well. Without giving anything away, I was extremely, extremely disappointed with Podrugs interpretation of Jesus being some ghostly zealot in cahoots with violent Jewish rebels. Add to that the extremely terrible ending where Jesus is painted as some less than god like weakling where the main characters must 'save the day' for him and the world and I might add most unconvincingly. The ending truly kills the entire book. I sincerely hope Podrugs next book is better thought out. His first book, 'Frost of Heaven' is a far superior book in every way."
2,"The Book ""Starts"" on Page 300","I waited and waited for the story to get going. But page 302? A bit too long. And three modern people get sent back in time, but with a promise not to use their modern knowledge in any way - and they don't. Oh well, there goes the fun of a time travel book."
4,Don't waste your time on cheap ones,"I tried 3 different eSATA expresscard adapters. This was the only one that actually worked. The first 2 were $15-25, I bought them because they were cheap. Don't do what I did. This worked the first time I used it and has worked continuously since then.What else can I say? It worked where others didn't. I can't ask for much more."
3,Does not seem secure in the slot on computer,"It seems to work, but I have not yet confirmed how fast it is. It seems to be very easy to have it accidentally pop out of my brand new, ""HP Pavilion dv6t-2000 CTO Entertainment Notebook PC."" It also seems to have ""play"" sideways and does not seem secure. This is my first ExpressCard 54 device, but I was told that the narrower ExpressCard 34 are much worse. This may not be SIIG or HP's fault at all, but just a stupid industry wide specification for ExpressCard.Also the drive did not work AT ALL on Win7 Pro 64bit when I used the then recommended 1.0.14.1 driver. I called SIIG support and they eventually emailed me a link to use the 1.0.15.0 driver, but absolutely no ""how to do install it"" info. I have been computing for many years and tried several of the 'normal ways' before I got it to work. (Sorry, but that was 12 days ago and I don't recall how I finally did it. My mistake.)Summary. It works, but not ready for Prime Time."
5,Good quality,use this in my laptop to connect a external HD and works perfectly SIIG makes good stuff and is well supported Definatly recomend
4,Works great but cannot boot from connected drives,"This card has worked well for me. Very fast with eSATA drives. I connect three external Western Digital 750 Gig hard drives to it (two at at time of course). The only other thing I would like is the ability to boot from the external SATA drives. This card does not support booting from the connected drives, or at least I have been unable to find a way; even after searching the web for a while."
1,...Ugh!,"I had waited so long for this book, and for nothing. It was such crap. Meredith was the most selfish, immature, deceitful, and quite stupid heroine I've ever read. I felt horrible for Quinn. He deserved someone a lot more understanding and sweet. He was such an interesting character, only to get stuck with a brat for a wife."
5,"Perfect daytime, buena colonia","Price good, deliveried on time, good package, smell good. I live in Venezuela, i am a office worker and believe me when say woman like it (the eau de Toilette). For exmaple, when i take the elevator i can see women face. If u get i little money bit more, i could recomend Pure by Boss and Aqua de Gio By Giorgi Armani, wood and citric. Saludos from Venezuela!!"
3,"Ok, but may not be worth the $","I bought this jacket for my Toshiba Gigabeat F40. It is not made extemely well. The flap that is supposed to securely hold in the Gigabeat doesn't come close to closing properly. I guess the Gigabeat doesn't have any danger of falling out of the jacket anyway. It fits so tightly that I was afraid of ripping it putting it on. It is not very stylish, compared with other covers. (If only there were an abundance of cases for the Gigabeat like there are for iPods.)It is somewhat comfortable to wear while jogging, etc. Although you have to put the armband on pretty tight so it won't slide off when you sweat. Part of that is due to the weight of the Gigabeat, but the velcro armband is not great for someone with small arms like me. I guess since this is the only armband I could find for the Gigabeat anywhere, beggars can't be choosers. But I think for the quality, they should lower the price!"
3,observations,"You might want to order the book by Hubert, ""Hooked Throws - 20 Easy Crochet Projects"" as it seems the scarf patterns are simply the throw patterns/afghan patterns which were revised to make the scarves in this book. If you want easy to make items with detailed instructions and excellent photos I highly recommend the Hubert books. If you can decrease beginning chain stitches, there is no need to spend more $ for repeated patterns."
4,Hooked Scarves,It is a good book with projects for various skill levels. I would recommend it to my friends.
5,blink!! (sorry I couldn't think of a catchier title),"Although I was expecting a little bit more when I bought this DVD, it was still great and worth the money. I do wish that they would have put all their music videos as well as more concert footage, but it's still a great DVD. This DVD has the music videos for first date, stay together for the kids, the rock show, and the original stay together for the kids which was reshot after Sept. 11. Their are five concer videos (the rock show, carousel, first date, aliens exist, anthem part II) and plenty of fun footage like Tom explaining his belief in UFOs, Mark ""undercover"" talking to people at his shows, and plenty of backstage footage. Overall, its a great buy for any blink fan."
1,Pile of crap,"I'm a big BLink fan, but I was completely disappointed with this video. All it shows is them talking, hanging out in the van, and Tom drueling on himself. It's pointless, there's pratically no music in here, it's just showing snippets of their lives. Completely boring pile of crap!!If you want videos and music, get the Best of BLink instead."
5,blinks just awsome,"ok, 2 words. f***ing rad. i've been a blink far since i was 9 and im 15 now and i picked this up prob. about 2 years ago when it came out, and oo man, after seeing the 1st urethra chronicles i thought i was the biggest i could possably be, but after this, ooo man. its got their music videos from take off your pants and jacket, and the original stay together for the kids video that never got released, and its got videos of them live in chicago. i just hope they put out another video of them for the selftitled album, i heard theyre puttin out a video of the tour with no doubt, but i don't know, thatd be rad tho."
5,This DVD RULES,"This DVD has everything a true Blink fan needs. It contains about 8 of their music videos along with two live performances from them. It also has interviews with each of the members (Mark, Tom, and Travis for those of you who are..well..stupid), etc. And it comes with a free chocolate bar..wait...no, well it doesn't have that, but BLINK 182 RULES and if you don't buy this I'm going to hurt you..and then call you a vulgar name."
1,PURE [baloney],"I can't believe so many people would call BLINK the 'Best in Punk Rock' when their songs are more pop than punk; people should open their eyes and ears that this kind of music isn't what punk is all about & there are a lot of great underground bands out there that truly represent punk. and if you're buying this for it's 'humor', then go buy some funny movies, coz this here's just a part of Blink's scheme to fool kids that they are SO punk."
5,182% GREAT,This DVD is great! I am a 12 year old fan and I love it! This DVD has every thing from music videos from the tail or the unicorn and the dragon(really!). I've never seen the first one but it cant be as good as this!
4,Blink doesn't disappoint,"This is a great DVD if your a Blink fan or just like their music and/or videos. The music videos are first date, rockshow, stay together for the kids, and a never released version of stay together for the kids. This DVD has live performances, which they made sound better because they [stink] at singing when their live. This DVD also has tour footage, making of their videos, and many other funny moments. It's not as good as the first urethra chronicles, but it's definetly worth the money."
5,"The Urethra Chronicles, Vol. II - Great Buy","The Urethra Chronicles, Vol. II is a great investment for the biggest of blink-182 fans that may know everything about Mark, Tom, & Travis, to the fans that may be trying to learn more about them. This DVD includes indepth interviews with Mark, Tom, & Travis, the making of ""The Rock Show"", ""First Date"", & ""Stay Together For The Kids"" music videos. It also includes behind the scenes footage of blink-182 tour life, what goes on backstage, and while in the recording studio, & so much more. My favorite part of the DVD is right before the credits when Mark, Tom, & Travis talk about their friendship and the band to ""What Went Wrong"". Honestly, I would buy this DVD even if that was the only part it had on it. This DVD does have a PARENTAL ADVISORY warning on it, but it is mainly for the language in their songs. The Urethra Chronicles, Vol. II = Great Buy!"
4,Worth Every Penny,"Im a fan of Blink 182 and I was not disapointed with this DVD at all. Packed full of nudity, swearing and potty jokes its absolutley HILARIOUS! The footage is absolutley awesome and it gives you an inside look at Mark, Tom, Travis and their antics. It also gives you a look on what life on tour is like for them and it shows you all of the friends they've met along the way. Plus it has their original and funny videos for ""Dammit"" ""Josie"" ""Whats My Age Again?"" and ""All The Small Things"" The only flaw is that they could have had a little more than 52 mins worth of footage but its all good anyway. Perfect for any Blink fan. Why not pick it up today?"
5,BUY IT FOOL,"I f u think u are a blink fan but r ""considering"" buying this dvd, your not a blink fan! it is simply one of the funnist things u will ever see. ok it isnt as good as the urethera chronicles 2 but hey this is funny enough to have u watching it 2 and 3 times a day! u get all the bands vids from the past 4 years inculding dammit, josie, whats my age again,all the small things, and adams song! as well as seeing mark pretend to have sex with the camera! tom masterbate, and travis like uve never seen him b4! so what are you waiting for f**king go and buy it dude! (or dudette)"
2,Too thin,"I have always liked the pearl white kid finish letter sheets. However, these notes are thin and flimsy. The envelopes are thin too. After writing a note, folding it as designed, then placing it in the envelope... I can read the note if I hold the envelope up to a weak light."
4,"Great maps, but may need to update firmware","I'm currently sitting in Stavanger, Norway with my Garmin 755T. NO satellite signal. None. Walked all around the city. I was in Oslo, Asker, and Kristiansand earlier this week. No satellite signal. Turns out that after installing the map memory card I needed to update my GPS firmware via the Garmin website. Just be aware in case you have the same issue. After update, all works fine."
1,Never...never again. You live and learn.,"So I bought these shoes on the hunch that they'd be great...they sucked. And because of the no return policy, I'm stuck with them and I'm $90 something dollars poorer. I should have known better and just went with the 2130's like I've been getting for years now. I wore the Trainers once and came out of a 9 mile run the next day with countless blisters...waaay too small and not the least bit comfortable. I hate to be a debbie downer, but these shoes truly suck. If you're feeling risky, definitely go up atleast one size...and buy blenty of blister meds and bandaids."
2,sorely disappointed....,"Pun definitely intended. I have been buying asics ds trainers for over 5 years and have yet to stray from this ideal product. Unfortunately, the ds trainer xii has really missed the mark. Yes, they still provide stability in a lightweight form BUT this model is much narrower in the toes. My poor little pinky toes have been smashed under their neighboring toes, leaving me with sore inflamed toes and feet. For the record, I consider my feet average width so I suppose this model is tailored more towards the narrow footed."
3,"Nice and basic, but there are better","A very introductory book on the craft of blacksmithing. Unfortunately, he only hints at how to do some of the difficult projects. ""The Complete Modern Blacksmith"" by Alexander Weygers has alot more projects and ""The Skills of a Balcksmith"" by Mark Aspery is the best introductory book."
1,Short on Information,"I have read several modern books on blacksmithing. This one looked like it would be just what I wanted. The projects were practical and useful around the house. HOWEVER, the author never really tells you how to do any of the projects. The entire book seems to start out with good information and then drifts away to the next topic without completing the information. This was the most frustrating book I have found on the subject. I kept looking for what else I had to buy the get the rest of the information. It just isn't there. There are much better books out there."
1,Typical McRaven....,"I've browsed and read thoroughly a few of McRavens books and I've noticed a pattern in regards to his work...That anyone can write a book, put a few pictures in and call themselves an author. This book is just another example of him taking just enough information and putting it between a set of covers, only to leave the reader frustrated for lack of good information. I wouldnt recommend this even to a beginner. Unless you covet disappointment. Not recommended...don't waste your money. For an informative book on the basics, projects and really good layouts, look for those by Lorelei Simms or Mark Aspery. Someone please go smash McRavens keyboard!!"
2,Polar AXN 500,"Nice features and more complete that equivalent Suunto X6HR but too heavy, very difficulto to keep it during fitness activity or competition. The S625X could be a better choice if compass is not required once is lighter and has the altimeter feature as well with additional bycicle and running features."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wish there was an rating option of less than zero. After spending hours trying to make this piece of crap work and upgrading my DVD-RW to a SECOND ULEAD compatable device, I've given up trying to copy VHS tapes to DVD using this. If its not telling me my input device isn't compatable then its telling me it can't calculate the space. I went back to Sonic MYDVD and in about 30 seconds I'm copying VHS tapes. Its obvious the world of computer video software is in its infancy and there's bound to be problems but when you have vendors like ULEAD claiming that their products are all things simple, then the industry will have problems converting more people."
4,Works ok for me,"I have tried various products to simply convert my home videos to DVDs. I have tried Dazzle, Pinnacle, MGI Videowave, Sonic MyDVD and few others, and wasted hundreds of dollars in process.MovieFactory 2 is great for beginners, it offers no video editing, but does a great job otherwise. Burning DVDs with my Dell (NEC DVD+RW) is a snap. Adding chapters, title music, picture slideshows is very easy. It also comes with various easy to use templates/samples.One nasty limitation: Each picture slideshow can have only upto 20 pictures. It should have been at least 50.Another gripe, it does not capture video from my Firewire card, I must use Sonic to do it.I urge every potential buyer to download the trial copy first from ULead. No DVD rendering software is yet mature enough to fit everyone's needs."
1,Slap a new face and a price tag on an update,"Does many things that should have been included in original version, and if I still used that I would be upset about being charged for what should be a free product update. Still lacks behind competitors for menu design, titles, overlays, secondary audio. 2.0 seems to be designed towards splicing pre-existing or freshly captured video, making a basic, static (no moving backgrounds or video chapter previews) menu and having some music play in the background. Good enough for archiving old movies or your favorite tv shows, or for ripping dvds, which must be its other primary function if it can import from VOB files. Otherwise, creativity is stifled once again.Summary: The people who burn dvds are rapidly increasing in number and in skill. Movie Factory (1.0 or 2.0) is too dumbed-down of a product to be of use."
1,"caveat emptor, no digital audio","I bought the program to edit DVDs made by a Philips DVDR recorder. Since it is digital recorder it naturally uses Dolby Digital AC-3 Stereo Audio (duh). Unfortunately, I did not carefully peruse the Ulead site where it clearly states that MovieFactory does not import AC-3 audio. ..."
2,What a big disappointment,"I was a happy user of version 1.0, it allowed me to create dvd's. so when i heard that version 2.0 was coming out, i went and bought it. What a big mistake that was. i had problems installing this software onto my PC. after doing a complete system restore, i was able to install it. but i was highly disappointed. this program is buggy. keeps getting error messages. the reason why i wanted to upgrade to version 2.0 is because of it's ability to burn directly to the disc itself instead of to the HD. the only thing it does is create discs which is what version 1.0 can do as well. if u have version 1, i would definetly skip this version. i agree with some of the other users, this should have been included in the version 1.0"
4,A Young Boy's Ordeal...,"Young Shomani's parents are in prison and his grandmother can no longer care for him so he's put in a Boy's Home in Napa. Resisting at first, he finally learns the important lessons in life and becomes an upstanding young man. This book has valuable lessons for youths who are headed down the wrong track. A realistic and sensitive portrayal of a young boy's struggles to reach maturity and self pride. Highly recommended reading for today's troubled youth and those who care for them."
1,Dumb book,"I have to say that reading this book was a waste of time - a bigger waste of time than the worst meeting ever! The book is written for morons. It's all bullet points and idiotic, irrelevant quotations from Ben Franklin and Shakespeare. I wish I could find a decent book on managing meetings - this one is certainly not it."
5,"Update on Sir Philip Sidney, a study in conflict",I am writing in to correct m original review. Please note that the book is by C Henry Warren NOT Henry C Warren!
2,Coltrane is great - movie is weak,"Coltrane and his music is really genius. The same I expect from the movie about him.Why I consider it weak:1. It is only 60 min and not all the time is for his music. DVD can fill > 3 h.2. Comments are interrupting his performance. The sessions are cut at the middle.I think I need to wait for DVD writer and create the movie that I want by myself. I want to have whole session of performance from Jazz Casual (weak picture, but the sound recording is good). I want to see as much as possible from Kind of Blue, My Favorite Things, Giants Steps and Love Supreme. I saw the parts from these sessions but I want to have all of it. I don't care that the picture can be weak, but I want to see Coltranes fingers and hear his sax.Also for music DVD it should be the option to play only music without comments, because after couple of times you probable want to hear only music and not listen to the story."
4,What this book is doing for me.,"I suffer from anxiety and panic and I don't know how or why I found this book...but it's been a Godsend. I have learned so much about myself within the pages of this book.The only thing that bothered me about this book is that it's not as well written as some books I have read. However, it just makes you feel like someone ""normal""...someone not perfect, wrote this book. Almost like a friend talking to you from it's pages. It is an easy read and very effective.It's spiritual without being condescending...it's spiritual without being overly religious.I recommend this book to anyone on the journey to discovering themselves, especially if you are battling anxiety, panic or any other psychological problems such as OCD, PTSD or phobia in general."
3,die hard collection,"This took a very long time to get from Amazon, 27 or 28 days. It's very difficult to get something replaced by amazon when it is lost in the mail, they wait a very long time. We still never got the first shipment but good luck to you if you have something lost in the mail, what a hassle!"
2,Be aware!,"Description states NO EXTRA""S! Back of case photo also shows no sign of extras! This set comes 4 discs in one case."
2,3 out of the 4 worked,all the die hards work accept the live free die hard does not work very disapponted
3,Perfect Christmas movie...,"The hero, John Connor, an expert on European footwear and cigarettes usurps the detonators of world class bank robbers who hold an entire hotel hostage. He throws the detonators down the elevator shaft with a computer to the dismay of the police and robbers. Then he and his wife go on the roof and foil the plan to kill hostages with a gun and some Christmas packaging tape."
1,blue ray dvd,My dvd's did not play in my blue ray machine. It may be a defect in workmanship of the dvd's.
3,Could Have Been A Good Set!,"The die hard movies are here in force and they are what you'd expect, the first three just as good as ever, with the crappy fourth one along for the ride. But what really negatively impacts the set, is the die hard 4 version is the pg13 one. So you have 3 R rated movies and a pg-13 one. Point in that was? Fox surely dropped the ball, wait for the inevitable 5 movie collection, maybe then Fox will wise up."
3,25th Anniversary DH4 is PG-13 version,"I love the Die Hard movies, but am really disappointed with the 25th anniversary box set, so I'm giving this 3 stars.I was looking forward to seeing Die Hard 4 it in its full, uncut blu-ray glory and couldn't tell by the description here if the 25th anniversary edition would deliver. It was on sale, so I took a chance. It arrived and I found no mention of rating on the box or the disc, so I popped in Die Hard 4 and...yep, it's the edited, PG-13-rated version. That means John McCane's catchphrase gets cut; that's right, the concluding 4-syllable profanity is cut from John's ""Yippie-ki-yay"" catchphrase. Maybe it's just me, but that alone was so annoying that I returned the whole box set.Die Hard 5 is out and no doubt a new box set will be forthcoming in the next year. Maybe, just maybe, they'll do it right next time."
3,sad about Live Free or Die Hard,This was a good buy until i figured out that the Live Free or Die Hard included in this was the rated version instead of the unreated version
5,THE BEST ACTION MOVIES !,"I just have watched DIE HARD 4 and I have to say that the movie is one of the best action movies. This collection is GREAT. If you are a fan of Bruce Willis, you MUST have this collection."
4,Over the top Reality,"I am a die hard Bruce Willis fan; I have enjoyed his performances in this Die Hard Series even though his character seems to be a bit unreal, i.e. I personnaly do not know anyone who his experienced so many death defying experiences and lived to tell about it. More power to him!"
4,Sweet,Die hard is awesome. Getting them all in one Blu ray is the best thing that has ever happened to me
4,Amazing... almost.,I definitely recommend this product for any Die Hard fan. The entire collection is perfect... except Live Free or Die Hard is not the unrated version.
1,DOESN't PLAY,These do not play in my Blue Ray DVD player!!! I have no idea how to contact the seller to tell them this so here i am writing a review. These are my favorite movies and I am so upset that they do NOT play!! Not sure what to do now>......
5,Awesome,Thanks for the candid review. I hate it when every movie is candy coated in the reviews.Nice packaging and I get to watch them all over again in Blu-Ray!Excellent.
1,Seriously...,Don't buy this. I guarantee a 5 movie set comes out later in the year when Good Day to Die Hard hits blu-ray.
5,die hard collection,"bought it as a gift, just what they wanted. have to add more words to satisfy this box which does not seem to be working well."
3,excelente edición lastima que sea de fox,"La edicion en si es muy buena, lastima que la cantidad de material adicional que trae venga sin subtitulos en español, ni siquiera en inglés.(es una pena porque realmente son de muy buena calidad los extras) El doblaje de la 1 y la 4 es español latino, y la 2 y 3, español de España.Si puedes hablar ingles fluidamente seguro disfrutaras de esta maravillosa edición."
4,Die Hard Collection (Blu-ray) Review,"The movies are great but there really is only one thing that bugged me about this set. Each film is pesented in a 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 encode. I realize that Die Hard and Die Hard 2 are fairly old movies now but this is Blu-ray and the picture quality is pretty pathetic on those disc when compared with the third and fourth films in the series.FOX did an amazing restoration job on the first two films in the Alien franchise, so why no love for Die Hard? It really could have used it! Ultimately I got this set for a really low price and I like the films enough to only be minorly disappointed with the poorer picture quality of the first two movies."
5,great buy,Such a great deal on a classic Bruce Willis franchise! Perfect mix of action with just a bit of comedy thrown in. The original Die Hard is definitely on my list of Christmas movies every year!
1,Die Hard with A vengance,My Blu-Ray player started having problems with this disk about an hour and a half in to the movie then finally gave up
5,DIE HARD COLLECTION Blu-Ray,"A package is nice, economic, fitted 4 disc in once small box.!You can recalled the excitement from 10 years ago in DH1, see a development in DH2 and Finally DH3, more modern, techno excitement in DH4.Picture is restored and clear as Blu,Don't miss this if you are Die Hard Fan!"
5,Must have collection for Die Hard fans,"Great movies, fantastic collection. Clear quality. I think better than Blu-Ray. DVD makes it still look like a movie. Blu-Ray makes it look like you are there behind the camera, as the director yelling cut. I prefer to have the glamour of being at the movies. Buy it and you will be happy with it."
5,Die Hard Collection,The collection is all action and Bruce Willis too. My sons favorite movies. He has the whole collection but had to have the blue ray version. Amazon offered a great price so he can start his blue ray library. I usually don't like this type of movie but you are always on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. Usually the quality goes down in a collection like this but they are all good.
2,Yawn,"My husband talks about how boring and obvious dramas (or ""Two people talking on a park bench"" movies) are, but how obvious and predictable is good ol' Bruce in each and every one of these...talk about YAWN!!!"
4,Lots of Action,All Bruce Willis movies are action packed and this one is no different. Most movies you have to set half way through the movie to see any action seens. Not so with Bruce Willis movies. You get your monies worth from the beginning.
2,Packaged wrong,Love these movies but was very disappointed that my set left out die hard 2 and instead gave me a second copy of die hard 1
2,I was disappointed in the picture quality,"Having just purchased a Blue-Ray player, I decided to get some of my favorite movies on BD-ROM.In every case except this one, the watching the BD-ROM version was an entirely new experience. The quality of this one was like watching up-converted DVDs."
3,Movies are great but this set not so much,"This review is more about the set than the movies. I bought this set at the store last year (so too late to return it), but only got time to watch them today. I'm not that much of a stickler when it comes to quality as long as it's not so bad that I really notice, which I didn't.However I had 2 problems with this particular set. First, half of the little tabs that are supposed to hold the DVDs in the cases were broken so all the DVDs were loose. And second, all 4 of the movie discs had one place during the movie where it skipped to the next scene (the 1st one actually had 3 skip places). Cleaning the disc and the lens on the player didn't make any difference.The movies of course are great action flicks, but people who don't like a lot of explosions and violence should stay away. Just wish Bruce Willis hadn't been bald in the final movie, he looked ridiculous. And also that the set didn't have these little flaws."
3,I dont consider DH4 part of the series,DH4 was a piece of rubbish directed by a total hack...the real Die Hard will always be a trilogy to me
3,Die Hard,"Very unhappy Can not view 4th disc, due to some problem with the blu-ray processing. Other 3 discs are great. Even call the manufacturer of the Blu-ray disc player on this and all we got was the run around. They blame it on the movie industry."
2,die hard collection,"Great through the first three but number 4 ""Live Free or Die Hard"" was defective. I'll see what Amazon's customer service will do about this."
4,Die hard for less,"This is going to be short, everyone else has reviewd the movie qualities so I dont have to. This set was a good way to buy into the Die Hard series. I got my faves #1, #3, and Live free or Die hard, which I think is the best of the four. Excuse me for being cheap, but it was a good deal, one I couldnt pass on."
5,LOVED IT!! CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN,"I bought the blu ray die hard collection and I LOVED THEM. After watching all of them I couldn't decide which one I liked the most, they were all so good! The sound is out of this world! A+++++"
2,Wait until the 5th movie comes out on DVD,"They should have waited until after the 5th movie came out on DVD to release this. It'll still be the 25th anniversary of the first movie when the 5th comes out in a few months so they could (and probably will) release a collection of all 5 movies for the 25th anniversary instead of this collection of 4. The ""Decoding Die Hard"" bonus disc isn't enough to buy this collection."
5,For the Family,Nothing like a little Die Hard on the weekends. Our family loves them and it's a great way of spending time together.
5,Great collection and awesome movies,I got this as a fathers day present for my dad and he loved it! I could not wait so i watched all the movies before he even took the wrapper off. It comes with 8 dvd's in 4 cases. (One on each side) In the beginning of all the movies the menus are 3d like at the movie theaters. It was a good touch and looked cool. The first 3 are rated R and the 4th is PG-13 or Unrated. The case is tough papery cardboard. One of the sides is open to put the dvd's in. The movie cases are those really thin ones like 2 cm thick. Great movie edge of your seat action. The unrated version has more swearing but it will not show up in the subtitles for some reason... I recommend this to any die hard fan and it says Collectors or special edition on all of the dvd's
4,Bruce Willis Plays Bruce Willis,"While not a big fan of violent movies for violence sake, the Die Hard series seems to be able to blend in a bit of humanity and humour. Some days a bit of violence on the screen can purge it from my system.Packaging is good. All 4 movies fit nicely in a compact box and don't take up a lot of space.Recorded quality is excellent."
5,I love the whole Die Hard collection,"I really wish I would have gotten the unrated version one though, not the theatrical versions. Blu ray is great picture!"
1,Looks no better than dvd,I love Die Hard and when I saw this set on Blu-ray for $30 I said why not. Even though I already own each one on dvd. Well sad to say the picture is exactly the same on dvd as on Blu-ray. So I am out $30 but having an extra copy of the Die Hard movies is not necessarily a bad thing.
5,DIE HARD 25TH. ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION,"GOT THIS COLLECTION AT A GOOD PRICE TO ADD TO MY BLU-RAY COLLECTIONI HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A DIE HARD FAN. THE PICTURE OFF MY SAMSUNG 65"" ES8000 FLAT & 7.1 SS SYSTEMMAKES THE MOVIES OFF THE CHAIN DURING FRIDIAY NIGHT MOVIE NIGHT."
5,A winner,"Got this for my husband for Christmas, obviously it was a hit, can't go wrong with Die Hard! The only downside is that I have to watch all of them ;/"
1,Eh. Does as much as your effort requires...not much,"I have the original hand cranking CD scratch removers. When you run a CD through those, it is obvious you are doing something. Scratches go away with the other types and you can clearly seen the marks left by scraping away a layer of the plastic. Not so with this one. I've run it several times on the different abrasive and polishing pads and see very faint swirl marks. I can already see the pads beginning to fill with deposits (probably have to replace them soon) and the CD I was working on still is not any better than before. You get more with the truly abrasive hand cranking type. This will go on the shelf."
2,Works OK but breaks soon,Worked well on a small number (8 or so) of moderately scratched disks but lasted only 2 months before breaking.
1,Total waste....,"Got it, opened it, tried cleaning a disk... clean botton doesn't work... Repare works, but doesn't repare scratches that cause jerking in videos."
1,10 tries and disc did not even spin ended up with circles on disc,What a waste of money! Does not work at all and the worst part? ITEM can't be returned for hazard concerns!!! And I am out $40 plusHere we are months later and I was never contacted Don't waste your money NON EXISTANT CUSTOMER SERVICE
4,Pleased,"This item came quickly and in condition described. easy to use and a good price. Doesn't repair extreme damage, but it was worth a try"
3,????,So far I have tried this only twice and twice it has not helped! 3 stars is for the benefit of the doubt!
4,Very good product!,This fixed my favorite season of Friends disc that was scratched and skipped. I love it and will continue to use it on my scratched discs!
5,Saved a completely ruined disc,"A brand new game was destroyed when myXbox 360 250GB Console with Kinectwas accidentally bumped while the game was running. The scratch it caused went all the way around the disc, and was quite deep. I bought this with hopes that I would not have to pay another $60 to replace the game. After a few cycles with the buffing wheel, and then one with the repair wheel, the disc works as it did when it was new (2 days before it got trashed). Great little device to keep around."
1,Not Worth It,Tried to repair a disk with a small stalling problem; Aleratec failed to repair or restore this disk even after numerous tries. Not what it is advertised to do.
5,CD/DVD Repair kit,"Came in great shape, just been to busy to try it out, but I think it will work great."
4,Good investment.,"Sometimes I tell myself that this world we live in is well-structed by all the people, put all the politics part aside. If you get sick, there's a doctor, if you get in a car accident, there's insurance, if you have virus in your computer, there's a virus cleaner. And if you have your disc problems, here's a solution.If you follow the instruction enclosed well, I'm pretty sure you will find your way out. I don't believe all the reviews by the users you have read about this product are from Aleratec, they are real users.But then, your sickness may not be cured by a doctor alone. You may have to do something else to yourself to get well also. Same here, you may want to use a good grade blank media in order to keep your disc alive."
1,Doesn't work and Amazon refuses returns of this item.,"This cleans discs nicely as long as you make sure the pads are completely dry between discs or it scratches them. It does not remove scratches or fix discs that skip even just a little. Amazon refuses to accept this back because ""it contains flammable liquids"" so I am now stuck with this piece of junk. The company just says ""sometimes you have to go over the same disk upto 10 times before it fixes it"" Still did not fix any of my discs that skipped."
3,Only fixes minor scratches,"This unit will fix minor scratches on discs. However, you have to run the disc through multiple resurfacing and polishing cycles. Even doing that, it will not repair moderately to deeply scratched discs, and it does not create a like-new, mirror finish. The disc will have swirl marks from the process. Often the disc looks worse than when you started, but I have to admit that it did fix a few discs. I have used it on netflix discs with reasonable success. It just takes a long time. I suppose that I had false expectations when I purchased it (expecting it to make my discs look new). Now that my expectations are set a little lower, I give this unit a solid ""eh..."" rating."
1,DVD Repair,This was a waste of money in my opinion. It did not fix any of my scratched dvds. I do not recommend this product.
1,Waste of $$,"With 3 young children in our home, we have many CD's & DVD's in desperate need of repair. I read many reviews through various sources stating what a great product this was. I was thankful that someone had invented a product that would repair our damaged CD's & DVD's so we wouldn't need to buy new ones to replace the damaged ones. However, this product only proved to be a disppointment and a waste of money. We tried to repair 8 DVD's/CD's and it only repaired one successfully. That one CD had the smallest of scratches in it causing only one small skip in the music. So, I wouldn't really praise the product for such a small feat. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It's just a waste of money."
3,Works but Leaves Marks on Discs,"The machine can make your discs operational again, BUT it will leave swirl marks all over your disc. This should only be used for discs that you don't really care about, but just want to play.If you care about the physical appearance of your disc, take them to a professional."
2,worked for 5 mins,"This thing worked great on one disc. It repaired a disc I didn;t think coud be fixed however, After that the machine stopped spinning the disc so it would just clean the same two spots on the disc. So overall I was unhappy with it but I suspect if it had continued to work as it di for the first disc I'd be very satisfied. Aleratec's customer service seems to be pretty good and they said they would send me a replacement. Amazon will not refund this item so buyer beware!"
1,could not repair any of my CD or DVDs,This products does not repair at all. it is probably good for cleaning the surface of a CD or DVD. i had tried several times to repair a cd but did not do any good. waste of money.
2,Not much better than the rest,"This dvd repair machine didn't perform much better than the rest of the inexpensive ones. It was easier to use than the hand crank ones, but the grinding pads/wheel gummed up after one use and had to be brushed off to reuse. It only lasted a few uses before brushing it off didn't help. It may be useful for fixing a cd/dvd that has a minor scratch that makes it skip but not for any heavier scratches."
5,Alteratec DVD Repair Machine,"It is excellent, get a scratch on a dvd/cd and it can spoil the entire disk..Odd, you asked today for tonight I had a dvd skip, jump and jerk and when I looked at the disk I could see all the scratches and marks on it, popped it in the machine, put 3 drops of their magic fluid on the dvd repair wheel and let the repair unit run it's course..I am playing the repaired dvd now and it is running without a glitch..I think the Alteratec dvd repair unit is fantastic, sincerely, --Phyllis"
2,"Works OK, but doesn't last","I purchased this based on many positive recommendations. It worked fairly well, repairing several DVDs that had light scratches and scuff marks. However, I found that moderately deep scratches cannot be repaired with this device. Also, the buffing heads tend to leave circular marks all over the disk, which the polishing heads can't completely remove.The reason I only give it 2 stars is that it stopped working after less than a year!"
1,does nothing,"I bought this product and followed the instructions. The product did absolutely nothing to repair any scratch on any disk. The buffer does leave marks on the disks, but this too did not repair any scratch.I totally agree with the others who have said this product does not work. I can't imagine how some people claim that it does."
1,worthless junk,"Messy, inconvenient, & poorly constructed, this product did not repair a single DVD for me, but began to fall apart, piece by piece, almost immediately. Save your money!"
1,Save your money and time,"Had this item less than 2 weeks and used maybe 14 times at most. The motor just made a loud noise the device jumped and then all was quiet. Needless to say I wanted a replacement as Amazon will not let you send it back because of hazardous chemicals.. So it is okay for them to ship it and then your $35 is in their pocket with no options to return a defective unit. They should post that the item cannot be returned for hazard condition. Any hoot, look elsewhere for a Repair kit."
4,Works pretty good,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. The price and reviews were pretty good. It died on him after a few cleanings when he sat it down too hard while cleaning a DVD. Took him quite a few times tinkering with it before it started again. We thought we were going to have to send it back, but it hasn't had any more problems.It works well cleaning, although it couldn't repair a few of the DVDs he put through it. We have three little girls that are pretty hard on their DVDs.Overall, we're pretty happy with it, but it's only been 3 weeks."
4,Greate value product to save CD/DVD's,"I have had a ""Disk Doctor"" for several years and know the value of being able to repair and save my CD's and DVD's (games, movies, music and data). I never enjoyed the hand cranking required to use the ""Disk Doctor"" though, so when it broke, I was very happy to find the Altertec product. It has more capabilities (clean, repair and/or buff) and with the automatic controlled, electric motor power it is simply too cool. Love it."
2,So-so results,I found it to be mediocre. I have an HD-DVD that would lock up in a few spots. I tried the complete repair process three times and saw no significant improvement.
3,"Can do the job, but...","I bought this product after trying several non-motorized alternatives and I have to say the results are not much better.It can do the job, but, even after several passes to the disc, deep scratches remain. Having then to do hand buffing witch is the reason why I bought it in the first place.Repair Liquid is very sensitive to temperature and buffs have to be washed from time to time to avoid damping."
1,Weak,I bought this item and it stopped working on the first day it only worked on the first game and never worked again I am disappointed in this item and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone !!!!
3,Cleans,This makes games play again that are badly scratched but it leaves its own micro scratches everywhere. Doesn't seem to affect play though.
4,Sub A Dub Dub,"Lots of little episodes in the life of a SoCal substitute teacher make up a broad portrait of a seemingly cool young man getting slowly ground up in a dysfunctional system. Written in a kind of free-rambling, Joe Strummeresque, hip-hop rhyming lingo, the prose makes a refreshing break from the norm. It's not like there's a real narrative here to be disturbed anyway. Rather interesting all in all."
4,A Seriously Lyrical Examination of the Schools,"Jimmy Jazz tells stories about his time as a substitute teacher in the varied schools of Southern California, using a prose style that bounces between Steinbeck, Seuss, and Kerouac. The lines work equally well read silently or aloud, and have depth equal to their witty wording. Great book, well worth the read, esp. for anyone considering or already involved in teaching."
1,don't buy this,don't waste your time or money on this. these guys need to decide whether they are going to be a latino band or just flat lame rock. it is horrid.
5,Excellent Lens - Great Price!,"I purchased the 70mm DA Limited to round out my DA21, FA31, FA50, M100 Macro prime lens lineup. I agonized for months about the FA77 vs the DA70 but decided on the DA70 because of the price and the fact that in reviews, the DA70 is sharper at f2.4 than the FA77 is at similar apetures. This, in addition to the faster focusing, quick shift focus adjustment feature, lower chromatic aboration and much lower price, finally swayed me in favor of the DA70. I am very happy with my decision based on use of the lens. I find the sharpness of the lens to be astounding with excellent contrast, color rendition and bokeh.I highly recommend this lens and think that it is one of the best values in the Pentax lineup."
2,Not the same,"This book is short 2 chapters.IT IS NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED,it must be a first edition or something..not updatede either,there is much newer technology.Too bad."
5,Excellent beginners guide,"As someone without a trained mechanical background, I found the book extremely approachable, entertaining and understandable. Highly recommended."
5,Delightful Read!,"Probably the best cozy I've ever read! I have to admit I was skeptical at first, as the premise didn't sound all that interesting to me, but based on the two previous reviews, I decided to try it, and I'm glad I did. The dialogue is realistic and naturalistic--doesn't sound overly expository. The characters were interesting and quirky without being annoying and forced. The main character is nicely drawn and enjoyable to spend time with. Nothing felt formulaic. The plot kept me guessing, and there was just a touch of sexiness to keep things moving along. I plan to pick up Webber's other two books and start from the beginning. If you're looking for a bloodless cozy with charming characters and an easy, enjoyable read, give this one a try!"
5,ANOTHER WINNER! GREAT SERIES,I started this series when I became disenchanted withmy regular reads. I'd never heard of Heather Webber whenI went online to find something that got great reviews.I LOVE THIS SERIES!! I'm totally hooked.Heather Webber is a great writer.You immediately connect with her characters. Fun andentertaining storyline.This series has it all.Remember when you finished a book and and couldn't waitfor the next one?The NINA QUINN mystery series is just that.Start at the beginning and read them all. Well worthyour time and money.EXCELLENT!
3,garden mystery,"An enjoyable, albeit simplistic mystery. I do like Ms. Webber's development of characters. I would like to get ""Nina"" to design my backyard makeover!"
1,Why did I listen to the 5 star reviews ??????,"This is like a musical nightmere......it needs subtitles as the vocals are unlistenable and the lyrics are impossible to pick up no matter how hard you try......this might be a good thing....if they are as mature lyrically as they are musicaly, you really don't want to hear them....... as far as musicianship goes this is so generic that any serious muso could have phoned this garbage in with no effort at all......many notes without rhyme or reason played at top speed does not create anything like music, just a whole wall of noise......the musical ideas on this release would not garner a positive response if these clowns were 14....this is purile rubbish and a complete waste of money...."
3,Not Bad - Too Narrow,"This text is an instalment in Zondervan's Four Views series examining various religious and theological issues. The four contributions discuss the nature of Hell.Walvoord - literal biblical interpretationCrockett - metaphorical biblical interpretationHayes - Catholic purgatory viewPinnock - Conditional interpretation (finite period of suffering then destruction)From my perspective this instalment is similar to other contributions in this series - generally solid writing, but within an excessively narrow scope. The book may have been more interesting if Walvoord's and Crockett's pieces were combined and a different view included (e.g. liberal protest, Orthodox or Jewish). Overall, the book is not bad, if a bit narrow."
2,"Some good material, generally disappointing","The volume does not live up to its potential. The authors focus on texts that do not back their positions. Many of their assumptions are taken for granted rather than proven. They speak past each other. Beyond all that, the so-called Literal View and the Metaphorical View are, upon inspection, one and the same view. The Purgatorial View does not belong in this volume, it's another theme altogether."
4,Changed my view,"This book is very well thought out and well written. I thought I had it all figured out already but I had just been following along with what I had always heard. This book opened my eyes, and after researching Scriptures on my own, I now have a completely different perspective."
5,Best there is,My wife and I saw Stu live in St. Augustine in 93. It made our whole 8th anniversary come to life. Ten years later we went to St. Augustine and found his name in the Milltop .Unfortunately he wasn't playing but would give anything to here his music . Thus we shall buy his cd. Stu is the greatest we have ever listened to and I hope we get to see him live again soon.Ben and Rena
3,Watch review,"I bought this for my friend, every holiday or special occasion we buy each other a nice watch. I bought this one without reading the dimensions on it and when it arrived in the mail I was a little disappointed in how small it was, at least to my liking. Maybe it's a girls watch and I wasn't paying attention? Or just a small guys watch? He hasn't worn it much yet and I'd need to wear it to see if I'd enjoy wearing a smaller watch as this one. Overall its a nice watch, just smaller than I expected."
5,Good for the price,"As it's already been pointed out, this is a beautiful watch for a reasonable price. The leather wristband seems to be somewhat fragile, though. Beware it's on the small side for a men's watch."
5,Correctio Officer Promotion Book,This was a very rare item. I checked the public library's and only one library had a copy of it. And it was only available in reference form. By going to amazon I was able to get a copy of this rare item so easy.
3,not enough scripture,"Dvd only has 21 scriptures in over an hours time. I expected it to be more since in it's title it said christian retreat. I think it is mostly the californian coast, so if you have his california tapes, it's some repeats. It does have a nice shot on day 2 with rays coming through the clouds that look heavenly and in day 3, there is a shot of the sunsets reflections on the water in the shape of a cross. Also on day 2 on the scene where you are on top of a cliff looking down into the ocean, there is a swimmer who keeps getting knocked down and drug around by the surf everytime he gets up, watch for it. I am still wondering about that person. If you don't have any of these dvds, and you love the ocean, you must have one. They are relaxing, peaceful, and very realistic. I have fallen asleep to them more than once."
4,Physics? We don't need no stinking physics......,"OK, first of all, this movie is really only for fans of giant robots, and definitely NOT FOR CHILDREN. This is not Gundam Wing!! The cast isn't really all that well developed, and apparently leans heavily on you knowing them from the original series.However, if you liked the old ""Force Five"" cartoons as a kid, then this will be right up your alley. The action is incredible, and the new Shin Getters are soooooo phat. The story is really hard to follow, but I get the impression that it's not because of the dub. The visual style may freak you out a bit at first as it has a definite retro feel, but I found myself loving it by the end of the series. The interviews with the voice actors are a nice touch as well.In short, just sit back, and enjoy the chaos!"
3,So-So,"While the book excels at teaching the basic concepts, during the later parts, it flops badly. where in the beginning the examples actually dealt with the questions in some vague, but some understandable wa, the ending chapters from 4-6 fail horribly. Of the many questions in the book, the examples at best give some minor insight into maybe 1/4 of them. There are even problems that have no way of linking them to the examples and even my professor had to teach how to do them in a manner very unlike the textbook.It's good for maybe the first 3 chapters, but after that, don't count on it for anything except raw questions."
2,It could have been good IF----,Doc Holliday was played by a younger man. Directors shouldn't take that much leeway. Doc was only 36 at his death. Having an old man play a young man spoiled it for me. Try Tombstone---there's Doc Holliday.
3,Hour of the Gun,"The film did not really take off or grip my attention. However it is interesting history, and ends like a classic western, with good performances- especially Robards, and a great atmospheric score by Jerry Goldsmith."
2,Not As Good as I Hoped,"I had never seen this film and was interested in it because of the director (John Sturges), my favorite actor (James Garner) and the topic (post OK Corral life of Wyatt Earp). I was disappointed.First the story plodded along and seemed disconnected. It lacked a flow and did not build up to the final showdown. In Gunfight at the OK Corral, the story built to the big battle with minor incidents that feed the build up. Here everything seemed like separate events.James Garner (who I really like) did portray a much different Wyatt Earp but I think he was much too stoic. I think he over did the emotionless aspect of the character.Jason Robards was not very good a Doc Holiday. I think he did not bring out any real character attributes for us to understand Holiday's motivation.The story said it followed the real life events, but it deviated in signficant ways. Earp never shot Ike in Mexico.Lastly, the movie was just plain dull."
5,What Happened After the OK Corral,"The HOUR OF THE GUN is a remarkable achievement for its time, following the exploits of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and company AFTER the gunfight at the OK Corral ... and it's fascinating.Jason Robards plays a wonderfully subdued Doc Holliday, almost to the point of trying to remain Wyatt's moral voice.In a surprising turn, James Garner turns in a dynamic performance as the stiff-laced Wyatt, who won't rest until justice for the death of his brother has been avenged.This film serves as a companion piece to THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL (wildly inaccurate in most of its depictions), and it succeeds admirably in attempting to set the record straight.But, there's still the Johnny Ringo bit ...While a VHS purchase may work well for some Wyatt and Doc purists, I'm holding out for a DVD widescreen version, hopefully with some extras for those of us who believe good things come to those who wait."
5,Boys vs. Men,"This film is a classic Western.Garner and Robarbs are tough,intelligent men.The script is the best of all the movies about the Earps.Compared to this movie,""Tombstone""'s Russell and Kilmer are more like boys trying to look tough and Costner's film is tiresome self-worship.The final reel of this film speaks to the closing of the old West more sadly and eloquently than any I have ever seen."
4,Enjoyable,I read this in one day. It was very enjoyable. I am looking forward to reading her other books and hope they will be as good as this one.
1,Did not fit 2009 50hp Merc ELPTO,"Probably a perfectly serviceable fuel line connector, but it did not fit my Mercury outboard. I bought this to replace the conector that came with a replacement line that was also supposed to fit. In the end I just used the original factory connector."
5,'Presently laboring over my epitaph. Hard going.'An era set in aspic,"'If I had it to do over, I would (a bit more gusto!)' Jack Barrett (no relation)What a century! What characters! What life stories! What cartooning styles!!! Household names of yore rub shoulders democratically with also-rans, old stagers with young guns, like a medieval guild. Some of these thumbnail lives may induce the prickle of a tear; try Martin Branner's for size. Great wraparound cover photo of the 1969 dinner (for some reason) which adds to the timeless retro feel. I could almost vote Republican - except that these are the guys that got (relatively) lucky (one son at Harvard, I note en passant)'Wish I could do it all over again - I'd enjoy it even more! Amen' Dick AyersOf course, the ladies are thin on the ground. Well, I spotted Irma Selz.. When you've chewed this over, time to devour Comix: the Underground Revolution, where the ladies get a whole chapter to themselves"
5,pocket pregnancy planner,"I find this pocket pregnancy planner to be a great convenience,filled with valuable information and small enough to fit in your purse or your husband's back pocket.

Being able to recall this imformation at a glance during your pregnancy or year's later to compare future pregnancy's The Pocket Pregnancy Planner has made my life a lot easier."
4,Great recipes,chock full of fun ice cream recipes to make. I have and will again suggest this book to anyone interested in making ice cream at home.I suggest it.
4,gelato cook book,"I got a gelato maker. Included with the gelato maker was a very simple cook book. I also ordered this cookbook online.This gelato cook book is a little high brow - real vanilla beans, real mint leaves, shaved dark chocolate, etc. Pulllleeeeassszzzzeeee!However, I found if I read this book and the very simple book I got the jist of what I was aiming for. So, I don't regret buying the book. My advice is though, that if you get this book, also get a more basic guide. Sometimes you will have to shoot the difference between the two."
5,"A ""must"" for all ice cream enthusiasts!","This cookbook of Italian ices, ice creams and granite requires an ice cream maker and an appreciation for ice cream: else preparation instructions are simple and recipes accompanied by intriguing color photos of completed dishes. Gelato!'s bright and appealing and is recommended for any newcomer to gelato-style ice cream."
3,Decent and mouthwatering.,"I thought the recipes looked and sounded awesome but when it came to making them, the recipes were not made for everyone. Alot of the ingredients are hard to find, or expensive, unless you live in a large city. The recipes I tried turned out great and were big hits."
4,Lovely historical book,"contains VAGUE SPOILER ABOUT THE ENDINGIt is a very well researched (as far as I know) book about the adventures of Spartan youth in Ancient Greece, his triumphs and tragedies and his dreams to win the Olympics.The only complain I have is the ending of the book, no, not with how it ends, the ending fits the story well, but could author be any more obvious with the foreshadowing? I was thinking enough already, if I hear any more predictions or prophecies or omens aboutVAGUE SPOILER ABOUT THE ENDINGdoom and gloom, I am going to scream. Otherwise I enjoyed the book."
3,Disappointing,"A big fan of the COMPUTER SCIENCE ILLUMINATED text, I had high hopes for this as a good text for my undergrad class on A.I.. I was sorely disappointed; this text is far too shallow for even a middle-level undergrad course. It also contains several errors, although that may be expected of a first edition."
5,Excellent and outstanding service,Excellent and outstanding service.Thank you for time and business.V/RINTULECT
5,SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR EVERYONE IN U.S.!,"I had the great fortune of hearing Dr Aldana speak at a professional conference. I LOVE this book and will start using it in my college class. It is very easy to read and understand, though, for ANYONE... I wish all Americans would read this. It is the simple truth that we all need to know and then react to... in order to improve our odds of a long, healthy, productive life! Buy this book for people you love after reading it yourself!"
5,This book should be a gift to all the people you love,"My mom sent this book as a gift to all of her children. I have been living a pretty healthy lifestyle, but as I read this book I have been motivated to make several changes for the better for me and my family. The thing I like the most about this book is that Dr Aldana has read through thousands of scientific studies and laid out the information in a consise and unbiased way that is completely compelling and motivating. I don't know that anyone could read thorough the first chapters without having a desire to improve his or her lifestyle in at least some small way. I have been telling everyone about this book, and every time I do I get more excited about it. This book will be a gift to my friends and family members."
3,A bit too much of theory..,"I bought this book after reading the previous reviews. I am a QA engineer working in OO systems, and I must say that I did not find this book to all that great. It is a good book, but I found it to be a bit theoretical. I would have welcomed more practical tips say on how to do performance testing on multitier systems, how do you adapt these concepts on hybrid systems etc."
5,A Must-Have,"I have several books on software testing, but none of them provides the comprehensive, in-depth coverage of testing that this book provides. No software developer or test engineer working with OO techniques should be about it!"
3,WELL RESEARCHED BUT AWKWARD,"This is one of the most comprehensive biographies of Cole Porter out. There are few stones that are not looked under but the detail becomes cumbersome and the prose style is awkward and often confusing. The cast of characters reads like a list of the ""rich and famous"" of the 20th century but the story gets lost in ""who knows who"", ""who is related to who"" and ""who is doing what to whom"". Still, the book is invaluable for its information and well worth the read."
4,"We learn when he wrote ""Anything Goes,"" he meant it.","I very much agree with the reviewer from Sicily, but there is much more to this book. There is much F.Scott Fitzgerald, an era long about a time and place many of us have not experienced...It is society, alcohol, party, good friends, drugs, and sex---this time homosexual. It is all fun and games, good times, and famous people. Sometimes, however, it is best not to know the personal life as it may spoil the song, the movie, the performance...but if you rise above this, as I did, here is a very skillfully written book with much information, perhaps too much information, but fascinating nevertheless. I am sorry I never got to see him sing and play in person as he was a very talented man and helpful to many of his friends."
3,"Good, but not great.","I suppose the challenge of reading a biography is slogging through the parts of the person's life in which you have little interest. As a musical theatre performer, I was most interested in the chapters devoted to the genesis of Porter's shows - to me, these were the most interesting, and seemingly well researched. The rest of it, particularly his early life, did not quite spark my interest. I did find the ending chapters - dealing with Cole's descent into melancholy and illness - to be touching. I did gain some insight into the glamorous world of Mr. Porter's time - quite the polar opposite to the Great Depression and WWII. In the sense that I admire books that give me a glimpse into a world different from my own, I liked it."
3,Interesting but better books out there,"A strange collection of channeled devic information expressed in a poetic way together with Wiccan rituals from Beyerl's Lothlorien tradition.This book is okay but not in the same league as two of his other books which are excellent:The Master Book of HerbalismA Wiccan BardoFor books on devas I'd recommend instead Dorothy Maclean's ""To Hear The Angels Sing"" and ""The Deva Handbook"" by Nathaniel Altman. Also good is Don Hawken's ""The Magic of Findhorn""."
2,Not Very Bright,"Bought this to use as an extra light for reading maps, etc. at night in my car. Unfortunately, it is very dim and not very usable for this application."
5,Incredible help at all levels,"This book is being used by a relative, who is a high school history teacher in Canada, as a basis for teaching students how to write essays, was used for a Graduation thesis at Bezerkley, is used by a grandchild in Arizona, who is in middle school, was used by 3 friends children through senior high and university. This is a tough book to find, but it a great and useful tool."
4,The Story of Jazz,"This is a good DVD for people of any age who are interested in learning more about the roots of jazz music. The DVD features excellent recorded and video music clips, as well as interviews from some contemporary-to-the-great jazz musicians.My only complaint is that the DVD, for the sake of time, glosses over some of the more intricate details of jazz history (which is understandable), and seems to ignore larger contributions from some of the lesser known jazz artists.A great buy, especially if you are a music teacher in need of a sub plan at a good time in your curriculum."
2,Enough of this racial bias!,"I watched this CD with great anticipation, and was very disappointed. It treated the contributions of African American musicians well, but downplayed what white musicians did. The Original Dixieland Jazz Band (""not the real thing""), Bix Beiderbecke (north side Chicago, but King Oliver was the south side--where it was really happening), and Benny Goodman (whose real claim was that he used Fletcher Henderson's arrangements) are not given their due. The contributions of Muggsy Spanier, the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, the Bob Crosby Bobcats, and (more recently) the Basin Street Six and Pete Fountain were either not mentioned or brushed aside. Jazz came out of a multicultural climate and white musicians have made their indelible marks,so that jazz is America's true art form. Enough of this bias--jazz is international!"
5,Offers many twists and turns,"Rachel Alexander suffers from insomnia, which leads to an unusual job with transsexual prostitutes who are concerned about the murder of a fellow working girl. Shadowy intrigue and urban noir mingle in this mystery which offers many twists and turns."
3,Serves the purpose,"Not the best quality item, but it does teach and do the job if nothing else available. Didn't have the $ to buy the more expensive ones, but will get one eventually."
5,remarkable research,"Edna Barney brings a whole new dimension to the word ""meticulous"" with this beautifully and lovingly researched genealogy of the Peyton family, starting with the family's English roots. Hugely impressive, it sets a benchmark in the field of genealogy for attention to detail and careful presentation, starting with the very fine cover design. Great job!Ian Ruxton, co-author ofJapanese Students at Cambridge University in the Meiji Era, 1868-1912: Pioneers for the Modernization of Japan, also available on amazon.com as a hardcover."
5,A SOLID RECORD,"This record has really surprised me, it has made the music I been listening to sound weak and dull. This record is a breath of fresh air. You will not regret buying this cd if your one to like metalcore and breakdowns. Oh yeah and this is one band that has a great singer unlike 70% of metalcore voices..JUST BUY IT!!!!!"
3,nice video,"Their idea of a fashion show, with the model changing in and out of lingerie..full nudity between clothed part..but no close ups..great looking model c or d-cups...But after you watch for few minutes the start going thru the same clothes again...but still very nice"
5,Beautiful and functional,"It's expensive (as in, you pay a lot of money for it) - but it looks and functions as an expensive item - shiny, well-made, holds hair well. Just a beautiful piece! Love it! (you can buy one from one of those drugstore brands for $4, but you will need a new one every month - so you will end up spending more money in the end!)Also, thought it doesn't pertain to the item itself, I was extremely impressed with shipping - it was supposed to arrive on February 8-14, but I received it on January 31!"
3,Hair Comb,Color and design are okay. I was disappointed that they weren’t larger. I have thick hair and need the larger size side combs. The smaller types just don’t stay in my hair very well. I'll have to give them to my friend who has thinner hair.
5,Puppy Polos,The puppy polos are great and look wonderful on my tiny chihuahuas! They were delivered quickly. Thank you!
4,"Very cute, served its purpose","Certainly not a professional quality wig, but worked for a 1940s mystery weekend we went to! Covered my head, stayed on, good color, no bare spots. Takes a bit of touchup, as all wigs do out of the bag, and it's a bit uneven in back, but if you're just looking for a Halloween costume wig or something this is a good choice!"
4,It is useful & NOT peverted like HDTM Bishojo,"this was a useful book. i think the illustrations were VERYamateur, & it had more of a american type feel to it but it was helpful it goes in detail about the differnt kinds of nibs and ink, screen tones, supplies, back rounds, shading etc. My favorite part of the book was the Backround/scenery part. That was VERY helpful. they couldve gone into more detail about the panels...but it was a good book. I was dissapointed when there was no reviews when I got it, but im satisfied. I hope this review was helpful."
2,Its not what I thought,"When I bought this book I some how got the idea it would tell you the ""super baics"" of drawing manga, maybe from the cover? Well its really nothing but bubble gum type chracters and a few manga pictures, it may show you some good pointers but it didnt really help me very much. However it does show you how to draw the kind of chracters from maybe an HBO Kids show."
5,A beautiful piece of art,"I am not a Christian music fan for one main reason: hardly any of it is art. Its always ""we want to be an alternative to the band _____"" so theres nothing original. David Crowder has changed that ongoing trend. His artistic maturity passes many of his Christian (AND secular) prodeccesors. His terrific blend of every musical style, every instrument, and every emotion make for a terrific collision (dont mind the pun). Ive seen alot of complains about all his interludes but these complaints are naive and immature. This cd would not be what it came out to be with the interludes that lead brilliantly into the next portion of the album. And as for your complaints about them taking up too much space I would like to point out to you that his cd (with or without interludes) comes out to a more full then your average cd."
5,My Favorite CD,"This CD rocks my world!!!!!The more I listen to this CD the more I like it. The songs are so amazingly unique. David Crowder has such a heart for worship. There is nothing better and more comforting than getting into my car and forgeting myself in the music. I would reccomend this to everyone, and if you are not already listening to it over and over again, you are really missing out!"
4,He collided with Sufjan Stevens,"ok. I read through all the reviews on this album and was extremely worried that nobody mentioned that track number eleven (O God Where Are You Now (In Pickerel Lake? Pigeon? Marquette? Mackinaw?)) is a cover of a song writtern by a great writer/musician/band called ... SUFJAN STEVENS. It is from the album Greetings From Michigan: The Great Lakes State. It is an absolutely astounding album. Sufjan's latest (Come on Feel the Illinoise!) is my personal favorite, (i am from illinois ... so there is a sort of bias). Anyhow i've not heard all of crowder's newest -Collision-I do commend David Crowder Band for trying to break the mold of contemporary Christian music. I personally do not enjoy that type of music, but Crowder is commendable."
3,Solid......Ehhhh Almost,"Crowder is my favorite worship leader. His vocals and sincerity get me everytime, along with his ability to experiment. This album... while okay... could have been better. I get pretty annoyed with all of the little interludes in between the music. Some of them work, but some should have been left off. This album is more driving than the last, but is lacking in the beautiful melodies and ballads of Illuminate, which was definatley a better album. If you have money, go pick this up, if not, buy Here is our King on itunes and call it done."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"Well i have to say that i have not actually followed any of David Crowders other CD's and so my decision will not be made on past efforts. I personally found this CD a little lacking music wise because of all the interludes, preludes, little nothing songs, etc.... These things didn't completely turn my off because Relient K in a few of their cd's has a couple songs that are just for fun and goofy. But this CD has way way WAY too many of them! It's like every 4th song is one! But i didn't really find the actual songs all that good either. Compared to some other worship albums this one was severely lacking-T Lane"
5,A very rare album.,"In my short life as a music lover, (I am in my 30's), there have been a couple of choice albums that stand up above the rest, albums that have consumed me, changed me. Albums that all of a sudden make the rest of my music collection seem drab and gray. In this select category, I would include:U2: The Joshua TreeRadiohead: OK Computer.That's probably it. Until now. This new DC*B album is absolutely fantastic. The first two nights I owned it, I couldn't sleep for thinking about it - I had to get out of bed and hear it again. (My wife thought I was crazy at first, until it got under her skin as well!).What a privilege to have an album like this that also happens to be an intense Christian worship album. Please, do yourself a favour and buy it!Oh, and don't buy it off of iTunes like I did. The songs all meld together like Dark Side of the Moon, and you don't want those pesky gaps in between them."
5,Love it!!,"I love this album! David Crowder Band is one of my favorite Christian bands and this album is awesome, just like I expected! If you love David Crowder, you won't be disappointed with this album!!"
5,Best Worship Album?,"This is maybe the best worship album I have heard period. I would put it right up there with ""An Evening with Shane and Shane"" and ""Kingdom Come"""
5,This Book is a MUST HAVE for Every Home in America !,"This book has saved me from making a huge mistake!After reading this book, my husband and I have decided to not sell our house (even though there is alot of work to be done).We now have a budget and a plan. This book has given us the tools we needed to make this decision.And this book will continue to be our guide as we tackle the improvements on our house.Thank you Vicki Lankarge and Daniel Nahorney! Your book is a must have for every home owner!"
5,increase your value,this book is a must have for anyone doing real estate of any kind. If you are trying to re-finance or to buy this ideas are wonderful and make completer sense.
2,Should be titled how to cut your losses,"The premise of the book seems to be that you won't recover all of the money you spend on improvements let alone make any. The book references remodeling magazine as a source of obtaining a dollar cost and value added. Again, cost is always higher than value added.Another fitting title might be ""improve the value of your home by 100,000 dollars while spending 130,000 to do it!""I strongly recommend that people read through the table of contents and possibily skim through it if you have the opportunity. Read one of the chapters and you'll see what I mean, then decide if it's right for you. Most of the chapters follow the same format with different projets. Unfortuately for me, I already bought it based on the amazing scores everyone else gave it."
1,Very little value.,Buy this only if you haven't been following news and magazine articles that outline the same issues. There is no enlightening message or original statistical model here.
5,Makes sense,This well thought out easy-to-read book provided me with many good ideas I have used in my real estate business. It was very helpful knowing exactly which home improvements will increase the value of my holdings and which won't. I recommend this book without reservation.
1,Kindle Ver lacks Audio tracks,"The book is a comprehensive review of music theory geared toward the guitarist. It starts with the basics and quickly moves to more complicated subject matter. There are numerous 'quizzes' and examples, including references to audio tracts. Answers are provided in the supplementary chapters. Unfortunately, the audio tracts are not included with the kindle version, and you can't print the quizzes on paper nor can you fill in the answers in the text. This makes it difficult to impossible to seriously use the material as a study guide. This is truly unfortunate because a truly interactive digital version of this book would be an incredible help to any guitarist serious about learning music theory."
2,Not What I Hoped,"I am mostly an intuitive guitarist who actually does fairly well as a performer. I was hoping this was the book that would help me along, but it was not what I hoped. It's still pretty technical and fails to link riffs, patterns, and fretboard relationships into music that you can recognize and use. A few bits were OK, but it's back to doing what I do best- listening and playing along, and teaching myself."
4,Something good for every musician,"This is a comprehensive overview about music theory for the guitar. The material is well presented, although I think the explanations are too brief to provide a real understanding of the concepts presented. For the beginner, it is a little overwhelming."
2,Product description is misleading,"The product description states ""The embedded audio provides 94 tracks of music examples, scales, modes, chords, ear training and much more"". When I started to read the book on my Kindle I found there was an imbedded message for each audio clip which states that in the regular book an audio clip is found at this location in a format not supported by your kindle.I went back to Amazon.com and looked at the product again. Sure enough there is a small box located by the pricing section that states the audio portion only works on i-Pad, i-Phone and i-Pod devices. I did not notice this message when originally reviewing the product. I relied on the Product Description statement and ordered an unusable product.Be sure to read all the fine print and ads in addition to the Product Description before buying an e-book containing audio clips!"
1,A/V Content doesn't work,"Let me first say that the book is excellent; I couldn't ask for better, however the Kindle Audio/Video content does NOT work."
4,Fills a lot of gaps,"I've been playing guitar for quite some time, by ear mostly. This book is true to it's title - music theory. But it is applied directly to the guitar. The book filled many gaps in my knowledge such as key signatures, chord construction, and intervals. Well worth the money, I would recomend this book to anyone learning to play or to those with experience but would like to learn the foundation upon which guitar method is built."
4,"It taught me stuff, didn't scare me off","I got this book because it was recommended at Harmony Central, and I was starting to realise that I need some theory to be able to play better.It presents the material in a fairly approachable way, and I actually learned some stuff, which was good. Then went I went to lessons, I had a kick start, knowing some of what the teacher was talking about. That was worthwile. Lessons are ultimately the way to go though :)"
5,Solid,"An easy to understand guide in music theory as it relates to the guitar. I'm no wiz-bang when it comes to music. I constantly struggle with it, but despite that I recieve so much gratification from the effort. This book lays out the concepts in very easy and digestible chunks so that even a slow music learner as myself is able to grasp the concepts."
4,Bought this as a gift for adult musician.,"I gave this as a gift to adult just learning to play guitar. This person is a musician who plays regular gigs in Colorado, but plays by ear on other instruments. He really loved it, went right outside for the afternoon with the book, his guitar and the sunshine."
2,Very Unimpressive,This video is an entire 25 minutes in length. About $1 per minute. What were they thinking? This should have been two hours. And what was up with all the weird camera angles? How can you corner the world's two most premeir abduction researchers and miss the mark so badly?
5,breathtaking,"An incredible album... boa is undoubtably one of the most amazing bands of all time, how it's possible that the entire world doesn't know who they are is well beyond me. I'm not generally a fan of much besides punk (and it's close relatives), but boa defies any standard set in music. The songs are touching, and simultaniously energizing and relaxing. It's perfect for almost any occasion, before you go to bed, while driving, or while painting... you have to hear this to believe it.The only regret I have with this album is that it doesn't include Little Miss, which is one of my favorite boa songs.... of course almost all of boa's songs are favorites of mine... but still, if you can find Twilight, it's got all of the songs on this album in addition to Drinking, Little Miss, and the acoustic version of Duvet... and it's usually cheaper too since Twilight is a North American release instead of Japanese.Notwithstanding that... boa is FABULOUS! No matter what you like, this cd is amazing!"
4,The only bad thing is the price,"I got the CD for the 'Duvet', which is the title song of 'Serial Experiments Lain' (of course). Interestingly the other songs on the disk are best compared to the style of 'Artifical Joy Club/Melt' (ASIN: B000001Y44) than to 'Duvet'. Which is nice."
5,pouches,This was for a work project and the price and availability fit into that process perfectly. Items were reasonably priced with good delivery.
4,Enamel on steel teakettle,"This is a very satisfactory tea kettle. It has a good shape that allows water to heat up quite quickly, for all that it holds almost 3 quarts. The design is chaming, with the small blue bird as the lid handle making a delightful finishing touch. For the very reasonable price it is a good bargain; I have had similar kettles that cost twice as much that were not as good."
5,Blue Willow Whistling Tea Kettle,"I love this. We've had it for several years, and it has held up well, and cleans up easily. I like that you can flip up the whistle cover to deactivate it. It is a perfect match for the standard Johnson Blue Willow pattern, and is ample enough for your hot water needs. They are uncommon enough so as to be a notable acquisition. I'm delighted with this purchase. It is enamel on steel, and of course is susceptible to enamel shattering if dropped, so it may not be a good choice for families with young kids who are active in the kitchen. It has served us fine in an all-adult situation."
4,"Held my son's interest like few ""math"" books can!","I homeschool my 4 1/2 year old son. We enjoy many different activities, but math is often a struggle! He is good at it, he just does not seem to find the time for it. After getting this book, however, we just spent 30 minutes in the dining room counting out coins and jelly beans. He can't wait to sit down and do math again(but I have to wait for his blood sugar to level out again!) The book gives very concrete examples of all the different coin combinations from 1 cent to 25 cents. We also enjoyed reading about how jelly beans are made. I got a kick out of this book as I grew up during the Reagan administration, when Jelly bellies were such a hit!Buy this book, and a big bag of jelly beans and have fun with your kids for hours--they may even learn something:)"
2,Disappointed,"This book was in very poor condition. It had been retired from a public library after being well worn. The seller most likely obtained it from a library sale for a dollar or less and then advertised it as ""Good condition"" with a selling price of $15.30. I will not purchase anything from this seller again."
4,Entertaining,"Even as an adult, I am a huge Scooby-Doo! fan. Watching Scooby, Shaggy and the rest of the gang is always entertaining. I felt like a kid again, except I found it a lot easier to figure out who the culprit was. I have to admit that Scooby is still one of my favorite characters and I'm so glad that he and the gang lived up to my expectations once again! I mean, you can't get any better than a doggie detective.Disclosure: I received a free copy of Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated Season 1 Part 2 for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own."
5,A Great buy,"I love the show and this was a great buy, I'm so glad the DVDs were condensed like this it helped save some space on my shelf."
5,The Definitive Software Project Risk Management Primer,"This is the resource you need in your toolkit to stop the glazed eye syndrome that often afflicts project managers five minutes into your presentation on quantitative project risk management. Demarco and Lister have produced the definitive primer on the subject that explains the concepts in an engaging, logical and clear manner. Moreover, what makes this book especially valuable to those of us who work in the project risk management field, is that much of the authors' approach can be extrapolated and applied to project risk management in other industries and fields. Definitely required reading at the office and on our suggested reading list for our clients."
1,This is the resource you need in your toolkit to stop the glazed eye syndrome?,"Hardly. I'm not sure what the definitive source on risk managment for software projects is, but this isn't it. Not even a good primer."
3,Good game with small annoying attributes,"Last week I bought the game. WOW! I mean, this is the next installment, I can get FAMOUS! Well, the items are great. Studio town is fantastic, especially the karoake songs your sim can sing. But a couple of things annoy me.1) Christina Aguilara, Avril Lavigne, ect. All you can do is ask for autographs. Big deal! And can't we get any other celebs WORTH being on this game? Maybe giant celebs like Paul McCartney or Al Pacino?2) Gaining Celeb points: You need to get 2 famous friend star points to get above full career star 2 rating. To get the celeb friends you talk.... and talk.... and talk. You get MINOR interaction when gaining star friends. This is excruciatingly hard to do.3) Everything else is great!"
2,i used to be a fan,I used to be a fan of the sims. I bought all the expansion packs but after vacation i relized is there realy a difference. Look at it this way Maxis made an excelent game and made a few good expansion packs but now that there realy milking i mean come on i wonder if maxis will ever come out with another non sim game.
3,when will they stop!!...,"Okay first there was livin large then house party then hot date then vacation then unleashed now this!!! when will they stop!My computer is to blow,they already have 5 expansion packs now this is the sixth!!!Okay i admit that the new objects are kind of cool and the new places you can visit but there are also problems the sims superstar is going to burn a hole in my pocket and going to spoil my computer...."
4,1 star gone for to many expansion packs!,"The Sims is my favourite PC game but Maxis is making to many expansion packs. Even though all the expansion packs(except House Party) are good, I wish they would just make a Sims 2."
4,Probably my favorite sims expansion,"Between this and unleashed, I'm entertained for hours. I had recently lost the first disk, so I had to order again. I had all the other EPs, but it felt incomplete. If you're skeptical, just get it anyways. (It's so cheap, after all.)The only thing I don't like is the obsessed fan. I like to use the voo-doo doll to get rid of him/her."
3,"Good, yet FRUSTRATING","This game is very clever, cute, and fun.. except it is VERY frustrating. It takes hours to get your sim famous, and you'll find yourself spending your entire afternoon on the computer, ready to throw the game out the window as your sim gets rejected again. I think Maxis made this game way too hard, it's tough to enjoy it. Don't buy this if you have no patience."
5,Who Can't Love the Sims?,"Another great sims expansion pack.There are new objects and people. Go to Studio Town to earn your fame and a spot in the top. Build a recording studio or a outdoor concert. You start of doing boring karaoke, but then progress to do recordings and music videos. Become a superstar. You can go to spas and have an obsessed fan (which get's annoying). Another great job my Maxis.Check out these games:""The Sims"" or ""The Sims Deluxe""""Living Large""""House Party""""Hot Date""""Vacation""""Unleashed""""Makin Magic""AND slated to release in September 2004, The Sims 2.If you buy ""Makin Magic"", you will get a sneak preview to The Sims 2. It's awesome.... check it out. BUY THIS GAME!"
4,The Sims Rock!,"Yes! This is a way better expansion pack than Sims Vaca. It has new clothes (awesome), new faces, new things to do. I love the Sims and always will. I reccomend This expansion pack, maybe Sims Vaca if u like to have fun, and Sims Hot date. My friend has hot date and I want it now. I also want House Party! You will love this expansion pack if u plan on being a star someday. I do."
5,Challenging,"This is one of the best expansion packs if you are up for a challenge. Even if you are using cheats such as ""rosebud"" for more money or a rejuvenating chamber it is still a challenge to master the fame objects, build your career, and maintain the friendships necessary to climb the ladder."
3,sort of disappointed,"i loved the new items and all but......it was so much work to get the sims to be stars in factmy sims havent ever got to become a star.very,very disapointed.but i love the new items.it is still worth the money."
4,"Fun, Fun, and way Fun",This game is super fun.You are able to change their clothes and buy new ones. The new items that come are so cool like the porta potty LOL. Its hard to make yourself famouse because you have to call your agents to do karoke so Im confused. But this game is fun because you get money for not even having to work. This game is so cool because you can make the rooms look stylish or really ugly. I really want to become an interior decorator so this game is awesome.
4,Fun!,"This new expansion pack is really cool. Your Sims can become movie stars, musicians, or supermodels. The only problem is...it's very hard to make your sims famous! First of all, they have to suck up to a LOT of people in order to have celebrity friends. Then, they have to perform well EVERY TIME they work, or else one of their precious ""stars"" is taken away. (There are five stars...they have to get all of them to be the ultimate superstar.) This game is really fun, but I wish that it was easier to make your sim a celebrity."
1,MAJOR BUGS!,"Maxis is getting very lazy with their Sims series. I couldn't even get this to run with sound. I could however play it without sound. What fun is that? It is not my system either, since both the Sims and Livin' Large work perfectly fine. Maxis I guess is getting greedy and is no longer making quality expansion packs. I was hoping for a patch for Superstar, but none exist as of now and their technical support wasn't helpful either! I ended up taking this back and I got a full refund. Learn how to program Maxis!"
1,Surprised they released such a buggy product.,I bought this game tonight & haven't been able to play it more than 5 minutes. It froze my computer once but the biggest problem is just closing the application spontaneously. It's happened several times to my increasing frustration. If this doesn't improve I'll be taking it back to the store.My computer is a 1700 Athalon 512 RAM Windows 98SE machine.
4,SuperStar Exspansion Pack,"It's a good game, i just hate that the food and energy objects don't really do a lot for the poor simmies."
4,Reply to Please Help Me,"Hello. I know that it is frustrating when you can't get your sim to become famous! I have this game and I can't get mine to get famous. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to quickly get your sim famous without doing that spell from Making magic? Please post if you know. Also get a mirror for your sim and have them ""practice their speech"" it got my sim a whole star but i can't think of anything else to do to get them more stars!"
2,Very Dissapointed ..,"Okay now I play the sims for hours at a time because im addicted to all of the games, and I own all of them. But I am very dissapointed in this game because even though the new Items are really cool, and I like the new location... Its just not that fun! Its almost impossible to get famous or even to get one star, and its truly impossible to make friends with anyone remotely famous. This game was a huge let down for me and all my friends who play. I can tell you though if your looking to play the sims then your best bet is to buy all the other great ones like Hot Date or the best one Makin Magic. Definately do NOT buy this game!"
5,fun but time consuming,this game is fun just like all the other sims packs but it is very very hard to get your sims to be famous and they run out of energy in simtown to quick. i think that maxis could have made stardom a little easier and in this pack it is now twice as hard to make friends. but all in all still very fun.
5,THE BEST BEST BEST SIMS YET!,"Yes I know The Sims Superstar is sorta old ,but I still LOOOOOVE it. Even though I have all the Expansion (yes even Makin Magic)this one is the best, so if your looking to buy your first expansion this is the one!!!~*MichellE*~"
5,"Crazy, Fun , Great - The Xtreme game","Kids, if you haven't tried THIS you have been missing out Big-Time!! I loved it sooooooooooooo much that I can say , with total honesty , that this game must be played. So if you are uncertain , dont be!!! Get it now!!Love it , play it you will enjoy it as much as I did!"
5,The Best Expansion Pack Yet,"When I bought this expansion pack, I had really, really high hopes, especially when I heard that you could become a celebrity. Well, let's just say that this Sims game lived up to every expectation I held!! One of my favorite points in the game is that you can meet Christina Aguilera, Marilyn Monroe, Avril Lavigne, and you can sometimes have Andy Warhol take your picture. My favorite new object is either the sattelite dish-which gives you 4 new channels and 3 new pictures on every channel-or the music video set which lets your Sim shoot either a rock, pop, or dance video and sing along to them. Actually, the singing is good and the songs stick in your head. Perhaps the most memorable songs are either the dance: ""Hey! Vodgeskijay! Hey varn vodgiskijay varn!"" the rock: ""Sa jee, da ze down. Ah get onza dubijay!"" or the pop: ""There's a dawn, there's a dubijay."" In the end, I highly reccomend this product to any Sim fanatic, young or old, newbie or pro."
4,The Sims,"To me these expansions don't make the game alot better. Sometimes I just get sick of playing, it gets too boring. Im sure superstar will be good. If you have a collection of sim games then you will want this. If you get tired of The Sims like me, you probably shouldn't get this."
5,Awesome!,"I love this game! I got it after having teeth pulled, and when I started playing it, I completely forgot about the pain. Although I find it hard to get past 2 stars, I love making my Sims famous. I have this with Makin' Magic, along with other expansions, so when my Sim got fed up with her obsessed fan, she turned him into a toad! Anyway, overall this is a great expansion pack."
1,"i'm missing a game ,to it so i can't play disc 1 not in it ,don't get the code for it too ,so i'm not happy","i'm missing a game ,to it so i can't play disc 1 not in it ,don't get the code for it too ,so i'm not happy"
3,Make your sim famous,"When you think the sims were doing good they made them dancing,modeling or singing stars. Was this a good idea. well it is different but I think there are better ideas for expansion than making your sim famous. How about things"
3,Not as fun as I thought it would be,"I know everyone has favorites in The Sims world. I enjoy the Hot Date expansion pack best, though I've learned to appreciate the House Party expansion and the Unleashed expansion (keep me away from those pets). But like the Vacation expansion pack, I found this one to be really undesirable.The worst part? Because you actually work in ""sim time"" you never get a moment's rest from your sim. And home life becomes secondary to keeping up with all your famous friends."
4,"fun, fun, fun!","I just started playing the sims again, and it is really fun. I like going to the studio town and performing, but it is really hard to make good friends, in a matter of time (at studio town). Your comfort bar, energy bar, etc. are constanly decreasing, and sometimes your sims are not even in the mood to perform, which wastes your trip. Plus, there are many things going on at once, which may freeze up your screen, so save from time to time! But, overall, this game is fun, I like it much better than the The Sims for PS2."
3,Get it to complete your New Grass Revival collection,"The second of two ""live"" recordings, this one has its merits. The instrumental efforts of all the members is exceptional, as usual, and the vocal work is also quite good. There are excellent versions of ""Watermelon Man"" and the wonderfully penned ""Reach"". The 18+ minute version of ""Sapporo"" allows these monster musicians to demonstrate why they were often introduced as the ""best pickers on the planet"". The standard for the instruments they play is often measured by their accomplishments. If there is a negative to be found it is the recording's sound quality, which is not that bad but it's not tops either, thus a lower rating than other NGR works. Any of the studio recordings are a better starting point for new listeners, or the 18-track compilation ""The Best Of The New Grass Revival"". Avid fans will certainly want this ""Live"" album which is the only one including Bela Fleck and Pat Flynn, however."
4,I Spy,"This book is basically a series of short stories dealing with major spy operations, mostly involving World War II. The stories are interesting and well written but there is a certain similarity and synergism to the stories that does not come out well in this format. Also, the author gives compelling evidence that Amelia Earhart was on an espionage mission when she disappeared but the story leaves you wanting more.I would use this book as an introduction to this genre and if you are interested there are a number of novels dealing with the individual stories. A number of books have been written about the Walker spy ring as well as other spy operations."
3,A Good Book But,"While I thought this was a good book and covered some very interesting topics I found myself a bit disappointed that the stories did not delve deeper into what they initially touched on. I would have enjoyed this more had the book been, say, three times as long and the stories gone deeper. I finished each chapter, or case, realizing that this was quite interesting and insightful to what had happened, many times in a historical concept. But found myself wondering about the little intricacies that would have been necessary to pull these capers off.This book is would be a good start to preview some espionage cases and pick the ones you like to research further."
4,Good Large Cutting Board,This thing is big. It is also pretty tall with the feet it has. I recommend checking your counter height before purchasing this cutting board. It works good for my height (6 feet) but made be uncomfortable for some people to cut on depending on their height and the height of their counters. I bought some bamboo oil to maintain the board and don't have any complaints about it. I really appreciate the fact that it doesn't move around with aggressive cutting due to its weight and the rubber bottom on the feet.
5,Please read this book on a rainy afternoon,The beauty of the Dimity series is watching the characters development from book to book. Reading this books feels like a visit with your dearest friend that you only get to see once a year. You can pick right up where you left off without skipping a beat.If you read this one first the earlier books will loose a little something but please do read them all!
1,Disappointed,"I read the two previous Aunt Dimitys and enjoyed them thoroughly, but this will be my last. Although the writing is good, Lori and Bill are delightful characters, and the setting is lovely, the Aunt Dimity trick is just too silly after awhile. To have the very real world portrayed so effectively and then to have a ""beyond the grave"" element come in just when its needed destroys the progress of the story."
1,Very disappointing,"This isn't up to the standards of past Aunt Dimity tales. I found myself just slogging through to get to the end. The characters aren't believeable at all, the ones that ARE believable aren't likeable, the plot is flimsy to say the least, and no real crime is committed! If this had been the first in the series, I would never have bought another Aunt Dimity book."
1,5 Stars?,"While I do adimt that the characters are very well developed and it is a nice change of pace to not have fifteen people murdered in a mystery, let's face the facts. This book is not any good. The first two in the series were fairly good and held my attention well, but I had to struggle to get halfway through this one. I read a 250-300 page book in about three to four days, as I am a student. It took me over a week to read this one, and I only got halfway through. Being an avid mystery lover of all kinds, I can never wait until the end to find out ""whodunit."" This book, however, was no trouble at all to put down and not pick back up again. I did not know who had committed the burglary, and, quite frankly, I didn't really care. If you read any books by authors such as Lilian Jackson Braun, Mary Higgins Clark, Rita Mae Brown, Anne George, or, for that matter, ANY mystery author at all, do not be fooled as I was by this book. You will not enjoy it!"
3,COZY INDEED,"The Aunt Dimity series puts the ""c"" in cozy, those little mysteries that are usually tame in terms of violence and profanity/sex. Which is alright, we need these kind of books. Don't expect a lot of action or dark mystery in this one though. Aunt Dimity's journal writing spirit helps new mother Lori find out what's going on in the little village of Finch. An archaelogist and his team has the town in an uproar when ancient Roman coins are found in a dig site. The local matron, Peggy Kitchen, is all agog because the vicar has let Dr. Adrian Carver use the schoolhouse to house his equipment. She wants to use it for her annual Harvest Festival. When a pamphlet shows up that intimates the dig is a fake, it is stolen and Lori has to find out who stole it. Author Nancy Atherton has small town life and its eccentrics down pretty good and the book while not an exciting read is pleasant enough and should please fans of the true cozies!"
3,Nice intro to the villagers,"A good installment in the Aunt Dimity series, but probably my least favorite thus far. I'm reading them in order. This one however does give you an enchanting introduction to the Fitch neighborhood and Lori & Bill's village friends. For that alone it's worth reading, as well as a little bit of Atherton's tasty British history - this time about POW's housed in Britain."
5,TranceTripp is a Tripp through Scary Color Land.,"Truely a remarkable video. Here is one of those videos that you hope exists but cannot find. Swirling hypnotic tunnels of ambient and psychodelic colors suck you into a video that both trances and tripps you out. Very Very cool especially for those pro-acid people out there who live to experience something beyond the physical. Creates a feeling that your falling into the depths. Go watch it. Don't you dare try to watch it without the special glasses, the colors are ugly. Pitch Black room, at 4:20 light it up. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Hey I'm ollie fishman, what is up, ELO DIGGS","This book is about two best friends who attend boarding school in Canada. They are two of the notorious troublemakers of their school McDonald Hall which is their school and they have a very bad reputation with the headmaster of the school, Mr. Stregion. They are always in trouble. Everything that bad happens is always their fault. But finally, there is a notorious troublemaker going around doing pranks, but its not Bruno and boots, the two best friends. The notorious, ""Phantom prankster"", keeps striking and striking again until one prank goes so far that Bruno and Boots nearly get expelled. They are at the bottom of this and hey will do anything not to get expelled by Mr. Stergion. They set up surveillance but this prankster is so sneaky, maybe even Bruno and boots, practical joking kings are in over their heads in this mystery."
3,"Not bad, some nice songs here and there","Listening to this soundtrack is a lot more amusing if you have played the game, i thought it was a fairly moderate soundtrack with some very good songs here and there."
3,Not his best work.,"Nobuo Uematsu's last four efforts (Final Fantasy IV-VII) had astounded me. Even with the relatively poor quality instrumentation, the music itself was strong enough to stand on its own. Unfortunately, VIII's soundtrack is a significant drop-off from VI and VII, which I considered to be the two best soundtracks Uematsu has composed.The soundtrack really gets your hopes up with a very solid overture and ""Liberi Fatali,"" one of Uematsu's top five pieces ever. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. That's not to say that there isn't plenty of good music in this collection - there is, such as ""Eyes on Me,"" ""Premonition,"" ""Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec,"" ""The Man With the Machine Gun,"" and ""The Landing."" But Uematsu's wost works ever are also found here - ""Jailed"" and ""Residents"" are simply appalling and showed a blatant lack of effort.Is it worth buying if you enjoyed Uematsu's previous efforts? Probably. But don't expect TOO much."
5,the best FF soundtrack to date,"I can't lie, I love this soundtrack. I love it more than any of my other CDs. I listen to it more than any of my other CDs. I had the CDs before I got the game, and I could not wait to get the game afterwards. The music fits the game perfectly! Liberi Fatali, Eyes On Me, the chocobo songs are all the best! Of course, let's not forget the music for Balamb (town, not garden). And the 4th disk was very...active. The Ending Theme was also very good. I can not get enough of this soundtrack!!!"
5,My favorite soundtracks of all soundtracks!...,"When I played the game, I loved it.When I heard the soundtrack, I REALLY LOVED IT!FF8 soundtrack is beautiful,loving,making you want to hear it again,again,and again.It is worth the paper that's printed on.... You would love Overture,Balamb,Balamb GARDEN,some of the songs I garantee your parents will like for sure!You will not regret this soundtrack.You will like it by the moment you hear it I swear!Have fun once you get it!"
5,An outstanding and fascinating revelation of the border,"From the first page, you will not be able to stop until the last one. Backed with a deep professional research, this story of real life is told in such an intelligent narrative style that it seems like a novel. Clever, entertaining, revealing and enjoyable. A must!"
2,Buy something better,"This radio is cheaply made, the electronic circuity for the IF portion bleeds from other stations when tuning. I remember $15.00 radios that did better than this. My mother wanted a radio for xmas and she just wanted to her the news during power failures and cheap. She is 80 and and didn't want a digital radio."
4,Excellent radio for the money,"Bought this radio for my mother and she likes it because it's simple to use. I thought that the sound was very good, stations are easy to pull in and stay there, and it feels like a sturdy unit. I have a small hand held unit (model RF-P50) that I bought last year and I really like it. I've always had good luck with Panasonic products so I try to look for their name when buying."
2,Inadequate FM reception,"The size and simplicity of this radio are fine. I needed a small radio as a ""kitchen radio"" However FM reception is inconsistent and a number of major FM stations that are available from our other radios are not available at all from this radio. To be fair, the other radios we have are Bose wave system radios, and so I don't mean to compare them -- just to say that the poor FM reception on this radio makes it close to useless for me."
5,TOP QUALITY CONSTRUCTION FOR AM/FM RADIO EXCELLENCE,"I have looked and lived through all the boombox radios of the last 25 years. I could NEVER FIND A SIMPLE AM/FM RADIO like they used to make. I want GREAT SOUND...SIMPLE DIAL..STRONG ANTENNA TO REACH REMOTE STATIONS. SIMPLE BATTERY COMPARTMENT USING 4 AA RECHARGEABLE BATTTERIES. This RADIO HAS QUALITY, IT HAS STRONG CONSTRUCTION & LONG BATTERY LIFE. I WILL BUY AT LEAST 2 MORE."
2,Was not up to Panasonic's standards,"I was diapointed with this radio. The sound was garbled and tinny. It was like the speaker was blown. I was a musician for many years and know what a blown speaker sounds like. I contacted AMAZON. They sent a return label, took the radio to UPS and in a week I received a refund. Great transaction."
5,Nice Radio....,Purchased for my 86 year old mother who is nearly blind. She finds it very easy to use. The quality is comparable to a radio costing much more.
3,$100 for this radio? NO NO NO,This is a nice looking radio with ok sound and average reception but to even offer for $100 makes my blood boil. You should get at least 4 radios for $100. Do not pay that price. Look around if you must have it but please dont pay more than $25 for it. Its just a little portable radio and nothing more. 3.25*** The design is the best thing about the radio in my opinion.
1,Awful,The reception is awful and I'm being very generous by giving the product one star. I would strongly advise not purchasing he radio.
5,Great Gospel music,If you like great harmony and good gospel music this one's for you. These boys are the best and I would love them to come over to Australia some time and do a show. I would be the first in line to buy a ticket !!Love 'em
4,Works Great,"I love the fact that I can have a any combo of all 4 inputs assigned to any of the 4 outputs. I have 2 of these in 2 locations and only 1 failed once during a huge electrical storm. At the price, I should have just purchased a back-up. They are not better but a lot cheaper than running 2 $1200 sound processors. I have used other option and this is the easiest."
1,"Not a quality product, and NEC service is worse.","While the NEC 19"" monitor is bargain priced and has a rather vibrant display, it is not manufactured well at all. After 6 months of normal use (5-8 hours a day), the monitor just flat died. As if that was not frustrating enough, the NEC service department made it worse. You can call their 800 number and learn nothing (not even the hours of operation!), or go to the support website and be amazed at the total lack of information (no service locations, no warranty info, nothing).I would have to advise any Amazon readers to seriously consider buying another brand of monitor over this one. I have had a 'bargain' Philips/Magnavox for years, and have been extremely happy with it."
4,"Beautiful, More than expected, A BEST BUY!!!","The statistics speak for themselves.18"" viewable screen with only about an extra inch for box. Also a small footprint to boot. No pun intended but this is a bargain for anyone that works with graphics & has no time for distractions. Visual comfort with that little extra> good pricing!! Easy to set up, plug n play..If you have an older system, NEC has an easily downloadable driver for this NEC90 monitor. BUY IT NOW!!"
4,very unique,not bad stoner music with unusal female soft vocals to fill in.Great guitar playing for those into the stoner image.unique but different
2,A Mixed Bag,"Devlin and Emmerich are decent filmmakers, but their writing ability leaves a lot to be desired. The publisher bears the responsibility, however. The book has numerous typos and the kind of word and continuity errors that a good editor should have caught. During a critical moment, I wasn't anxious for the characters, but laughing. A character ""collapsed like a sack of steak knives."" Steak knives! And a character who dies on one page is back again 15 pages later. Still, the book is interesting for the background, the revelation of character and for the inherent vision--the images of light, shape and sound--that a good filmmaker must have. Please, D&E, at least hire an editor, since Signet can't be depended on."
2,Watch the movie instead.,"I loved teh movie Stargate, and it's spin-off series Stargate SG1, yet this book was a terrible disappointment. Filled with continuancy errors (i.e. there is a creature that is male for most of the book, then it becomes female, a bomb countdown gets mixed up), I found reading this book a painful experience, and when I finished it, I planned to write the publisher and complain. If you want to read this book, get it from a library, and watch for the continuancy errors; it's not often that you see errors this bad in a published book."
3,Entertaining as far as movie novelizations go.,"If you saw the movie, and enjoyed it, then you should buy the book for the extra details included in it. Or if it sounds interesting enough, just buy the book without the movie. Pretty light reading, but fun enough."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I read this book, or well, started to read this book about a year ago. While it's really short, I couldn't finish it. It is does describe life with an eating disorder, but I found myself getting bored, which is atypical."
1,Be Wary of AmazingClubs Ice Cream of the Month Club,"I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday. She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store). When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't ""meet their quality"" guidelines. When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their ""support group"" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group). I would seriously caution you to shell out more than $300 for this club."
4,Great .....,"I ordered this book and found out, that the two stories inside I already had (Eric Marquand and Rhiannon and Roland, Maggie Shayne Fans will know....). I wish Amazon would have stated whats inside this book, there is NO description. I thought it was a new book....the stories are great, especially the ones about Rhiannon and Roland..."
5,"Same book, another name","The stories in this book are great! The only problem is, I have already read them in another book. New releases may not be new stories, just the same stories with a new title."
5,I Love Laurel and Hardy,"I think these guys were funny. The DVD was great and the comedy deserves a six-star rating. I especially like ""The Sawmill"" and ""Hop to It Bell Hop."" They were the funniest."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I was sucked in by the low price,12mp and what I thought was image stabilization. The write up claims that with 12 mp you can print enlargements up to 30x 40"".... well, yeah... but who would want to? There is so much noise in every photo that I took that wasn't taken in full sun. Most photos were blurry. After using this camera for 2 months, I gave up and ordered the Canon G9 (which is FABULOUS). On the plus side, colors were accurate and it fit well into a pocket in my purse!"
1,didn't last long...,this camera I thaught would be great but froze up after less than 2 years and wouldn't work at all...Kodak wasn't helpful at all either...I wasted more than 200 dollars on this junk...my girlfriend's Canon camera has outlasted this by years and cost HALF as much...I will NEVER buy another Kodak product again...they are NOT what they used to be...
4,Quick Shut Off when using 1.2v Batteries,"This camera takes great pictures, and video, but has a few serious issues. When installing fully charged NiCAD or NiHM batteries, the camera will shutoff, with a low battery warning after only taking a couple of pictures. The solution to this problem is to install PowerGenix AA rechargeable batteries, which supply 1.6 volts, instead of the 1.2 volts typical on Ni-Cads or Ni-MH batteries. The camera works as expected now, with the 1.6 volt batteries installed.The second issue is the camera loses the time and date when the batteries are removed for only a few seconds. I've never been able to install the batteries quick enough to retain this info. So every time the batteries are replaced, one will have to go through the ritual of resetting the time and date.I bought a set of four of the PowerGenix AA batteries, with charger, for $8 at Big Lots. You can also purchase these on Amazon."
1,Kodak EasyShare Z1275... It's a horror show !,"I Despise This Camera.Clunky, cheap, unreliable, power hungry, stopped working after 4 months.Will Never Ever buy a Kodak again.After this camera, they are not entitled to anyone's business.Disgraceful to say the least..Anyone giving this camera an above 3 star mark, works with Kodak.I Can't see anyone being so deluded otherwise.The lense for instance states 35-175mm (Equiv.) = Lies.At best, Full optical Zoom is the ''equiv'' of a 50mm SLR lense.. which is to say, 3/4 below the size of what you see with your own eyes.The 12 mega pixel (If it even is that) is useless due to bad ISO perhaps or bad processor.. or a combo of both.. don't know enough to say.. don't care enough to find out.You have to wait all day for things to process etc. etc.If there are inaccuracies in my 'review' they're down to dissatisfaction and a show of as little interest in the details as Kodak has for it's customers satisfaction."
5,Excellent product for the novice,"Immediately after receiving and setting up my Kodak Z1275 camera, I took pictures of my dogs and some leather work I had just completed. The camera takes excellent pictures and I am very pleased with the controls and features offered. I researched nearly every camera on the market before making my purchase. I chose the Kodak based upon the 12 megapixel capability and the automatic operating features. The ability to switch to manual operation will come in handy in the near future. The price I got through Amazon was unexpected and the 30 dollar credit for using Amazon's credit card made the purchase even more attractive."
5,Best price for features,"I haven't seen a point-and-shot so complete in a long time. I just love it. Its almost pro feature, The details,even in a low light conditions, is fast recording the pics and the batteries last longer than my preview C743, and the HD videos, I'm really impressed with all of this and I think this Kodak is a excellent digital camera."
4,Great value.,"So far this camera is quite impressive. It's very user friendly, small enough to be easily carried, yet large enough to grip comfortably. The screen is vastly improved over earlier versions and the features are excellent. I did have to order the adapter for my Printmaker separately. The reason for a 4 star rating as opposed to a five star rating is battery usage. The two AA's don't last long. All in all I do recommend it."
3,"Camera OK, customer service horrible","Not a bad camera overall, but God help you if anything goes wrong with it. Ours stopped turning on after about 5 months. We sent it back and they claimed that it was ""corrosion damage"" and not covered under warranty. This is ludicrous. The camera was practically new and had never been near water. So for $90 bucks they offered a ""refurbished"" camera, which the customer service person claimed was simply an open box return and had been completely checked over by their service people. From the moment we took it out of the box it has had problems turning on and off. We called them again and they said ship it back (at our cost) and within 30 days they would determine whether they would replace it or not. Something tells me that they would find that somehow we had damaged it even though it didn't work properly from the moment we received it. We are going to cut our losses and buy something else."
1,Eats Batteries!,"I don't hate the camera, but the thing eats batteries as fast as buying 35mm film! Can't even connect it via USB without fresh batteries. Thumbs down."
5,An Excellent Traveling Companion,"Bought this camera to take on a 2 week Europeon trip from Budapest to Prague. Already owned a 12X optical zoom Kodak digital camera, but wanted something I could slip into my pocket. The Kodak EasyShare Z1275 fulfilled my wish. It not only fit into a pocket, but it also performed beautifully. The 5X optical zoom was more than enough zoom power. And the panoramic mode was great to have on those few occasions when it was the only way to capture a scene. The ""stitching"" capability within the camera does wonders; and all my panoramics were taken hand held. The camera performed well in all situations; including shooting indoors or at night with just available light. My pictures came out great."
3,"Easyshare Z1275 - Good, but not truly great","It's certainly a good little camera. The quality of both still pictures and video are good and the camera is certainly versatile, with presets and modes for shooting in different environments (the long exposure Night Mode gave particularly good results).However, the absence of a Viewfinder can make it difficult to shoot accurately, particularly in bright sunlight when the LCD screen often cannot be seen. Also, the video codec used is Standard MPEG-4 rather than the newer AVC codec and the audio quality on video recordings leaves a little to be desired (it's Mono, 16KHz 2-1 Mu-Law) so don't expect this to be a Camcorder replacement, even in the 720P mode.A cheep and cheerful little snapper. No more, no less."
4,Good but Slow,"For the Price Camera is Good. picture quality is nice, easy to use. But it did not take pictures continuously as it suppose to. It should be able to take picture in every 3 sec. gap. Sometime, I had to wait for 15 sec. to take another shot. I contacted the technical support team and they tried to diagnose over the phone, but did not solve the problem. Finally they told me, to send it for repair but I had the choice to return to seller so I did."
2,I gave it every chance,"I thought that I couldn't go wrong with 12 megapixles at such a low price.I was wrong,like other people,I can't get this thing to focus after 20 ft or so feet. the image stableization does not work!and the video is not smooth.The flash is too weak.The c875 takes better pictures.I'm going to return it and spend a little more and get the canon g9."
1,DON'T BUY KODAK PRODUCTS,"I bought a Kodak Easyshare Z1275 about 3 years ago. Never dropped it or abused it in any manner. Was taking pictures and suddenly horizontal white, yellow, and blue stripes appeared on the LCD screen with a washed out image. Pictures were the same. Upon searching the internet I found that the cause was that the CCD in many manufacturers cameras built at that time were faulty and prone to failure. Other manufacturers were replacing the CCD's for no charge. When I called Kodak I was told that the camera was out of warranty and it would cost about $100 ($80 + shipping and handling + tax) or I could get a 15% discount on another Kodak camera if purchased over the internet from the Kodak website. Never again Kodak! They don't stand behind their defective merchandise."
5,One of the Very Best,"With a husband and two sons who are serious surfers, we have nearly every surfing video/dvd available. Even with that history, Laird (White Knuckle Extreme) was stunning. Some of the footage is literally unbelievable. After having seen it several times, when my husband and sons watch it again and again I still hear the expressions of amazement from the other room. This is a real masterpiece."
4,You've got to see it at least once -,"Not a relaxing flick AT ALL. You will be on the edge of your seat biting your lip the whole time, while Laird repeatedly defies death. Not one I would watch daily - but definitely some of the most amazing big wave footage I've ever seen!"
5,Laird,Awesome finally a surf video of one of the most recognizeable surfers. This movie was well done and is one you can watch over and over. It's a must have
5,Wonderful!,The wonderful story and gorgeous illustrations make this book a real treausre. This is one kids will want their parents to read and reread. It's a must have for your bookshelf!
2,I'm pretty sure that Joe Strupp wrote those other reviews,"I know Joe, and think he's a nice guy. But this thing is nearly unreadable. Typoes and misuses of language abound - was there an editor anywhere near this project? The stories are half-interesting but half-baked.The only reason to buy this is to check out the very thinly veiled caricatures of San Francisco politicians - most of whom aren't that interesting in real life anyway.No go, Joe."
2,An OK book,"I read this book as a book club choice. We each take turns choosing the book to read and someone chose this one. First of all, I am not a fan of books of short stories. The stories were interesting, but didn't seem to connect for me. Others in the book club did like it. It was okay."
2,A very boring book -,"This book tells you nothing about traveling to places. It is a collection of storeis by authors that simply is not that exciting. The best story is about the guy in Spain who lives with his Spanish wife. The rest were so boring, I couldn't read them. I was simply not interested and very dissapointed. If this is the best of travel writing I would hate to see the worst!"
5,Size Matters,"I have owned a cannon s10 for almost a year. I am a REALTOR with a Century 21 franchise and use my camera for business and for fun. It takes wonderful pictures at all resolutions. It's single greatest asset though is its size. It will fit in my jacket pocket and can be powered up and used any time. I paid almost nine hundred dollars for the camera, power pack/battery and case when the camera first came on the market. At it's current price point it is a bargain. The s20 may even be worth the extra for the higher resolution depending on your needs. Also the software is easy to use and the photo stitch program for panarama shots works very well. I wish there was an affordable second battery available. Sometimes when your traveling it is not always easy to recharge the battery. Do not buy the camera without buying the rechargeable battery kit."
4,handy little camera with very good pictures,"Received this camera as a gift last year. I have found it easy to carry in my pocket, and thus I tend to have it available to take pictures at my children's soccer practices, T ball games, and family events. The resolution of the pictures is excellent, especially 4x6 and 5x7, which I print out on photo paper using the EPSON 890 photo printer. In summary, a digital camera which is easy to carry, easy to use, and produces great photos."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This camera is definitely not recommended. When i tried to digital zoom, it always blurs the images. Another thing, this thing EATS BATTERIES, it doesn't come with a charger or n e thing, and no rechargeable batteries. WORST CAMERA I HAVE EVER USED. If you wanna spend some more money you should go for the Sony DSC s85, that is an AMAZING camera.BOTTOM LINE, ::: NOT RECOMMENDED :::"
5,Great camera for great price,My husband and I spent many hours and days researching different cameras and different website. It came down to the Casio 2000 and the Canon and with Amazon's great price would couldn't resist. The Canon S10 offers many great features and is very easy to use. My 3 year old daughter loves the idea of being able to see the picture right away so she is thrilled.This camera has alot of bang for the buck
1,Do not forget to order Power Supply Kit,When I received Canon PowerShot S10 I found that AC adapter is not included in standard package. Because this model use special 2CR5 Lithium Battery it is impossible to use this digital camera without purchasing AC adapter. Canon recommends only one type Power Supply Kit DK110. This is an additional cost plus shipping and handling that I did not expect when I bought this item.
5,Wonderful Item,"We are currently stationed in Misawa Japan. I bought this camera for my fathers birthday so we can e-mail pictures back and forth of family and my son. The quality is great, and its picture quality when I go to print it out."
4,Classic Figure Kit,"This kit has been around for a long time, and for good reason. The figures are molded well, with a certain amount of customability with weapons and personal equipment. Surfaces are clean, free of flash and require little trimming to fit. Detail for painting is very good. (Note: These are plastic scale models, not toy soldiers. Don't expect to be able to use them right out of the box.) Given the small size of the figures, and the amount of gluing on them, don't expect them to take a lot of punishment on the wargame table. The figures have a slim look to them, which is refreshingly different from the ""chunky"" look that's become popular in medal casts. I used to see these figs on store shelves when I was a teenager, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they're still produced. The field of 1:48 scale military figures is not large and these Panzer Grenadiers are a classic that have stood the test of time."
2,Blurry Screen,I've got about 30 of them last year and after a year all of them are going blurry. Thankfully NEC has a good warranty program but it's a pain sending in and getting it replaced.
4,"Blood Legacy, A different kind of doom","Wow. What a dark album. These guys have been around for ten or so years and i've been a fan for awhile, but let me say they have outdone themselves. Martyr isn't your run-of-the-mill doom album. Im so sick and tired of hearing the same old doom cliches on all these supposedly new doom albums coming out, Blood Legacy delivers, they do it big time on martyr. Jason's vocals are so dark and almost black-ish that i really feel where he is coming from on these songs. Tempo's range from slow to moderate to in your face blast beats, it's a good combination that works so well on these songs, but i really love the electronic elements like on the song ""Martyr"". They add a heaviness to this record that will just crush you. It's a great album, almost perfect, But then again no one is, so 4 stars! Don't miss this one, trust me, you'll be glad you picked you up."
2,Don't trust this book!,Rough Guides has an odd point of view on South Africa. Crime is a relavent issue there. Don't trust this sugar coated point of view.
3,A decent read,"This worked out reasonably well as a two-century family saga with requisite feud, although I figured all but a couple side pieces of the mystery angle with still a 100 pages to go. The characters are fairly well drawn, and although the modern members of the bad side of the family feud were a little empty their progenitor was at least described with some sympathy.I'd rate this 4 stars, but frankly I don't know why Myers decided to write this as an alternate history. That aspect seemed totally unnecessary to the rest of the story. If it was because he wanted to display an America where black-white relations were a mess and there were certain lines one just didn't cross, but maybe things are beginning to loosen up... well... wasn't that what we call the 1950s?"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Look. This book is not worth buying unless you can get it cheap. Really cheap. Unfortunately Charlie didn't really know John that well. He saw John as a baby and later once when John was famous. This book just discusses too many things that are only vaguely (and using the term 'vaguely' is perhaps an overstatement) related to John. This is just a disorganized collection of ramblings by the author. The book about George's two-week stay in Illinois is actually a far better book if you are looking to purchase a Beatle-related book in the Why-Did-They-Need-To-Write-A-Book-About-This category.God bless Uncle Charlie, but find out more about this book before buying it."
3,Not for novices.,"I don't understand exercise routines that insist on being unnecessarily complicated--you can get a great workout with easy to follow steps. This video is not easy to follow and requires a lot of floor space. I do like the circuit portion and work-out at the end of the main video, but the step routines are too complicated for me. Although I'm over 50, I've exercise all my life and consider myself fairly coordinated and used to step routines, but this one is over my head."
1,Not Low Impact,This is not a low impact cardio video! Many of the exercises can easily cause injury. I was not happy.
4,Not Entirely Low Impact,"This is a really good, intensive workout. However, it is not completely low impact. It does incorporate a few small hops. On my part, I was looking for totally low impact--one foot on the floor at all times with no hops. The other thing that didn't work for me is that it is step aerobics. The write up on it didn't make that apparent to me and it does not show on the image. I am not interested in step aerobics and had a hard time adapting the steps to aerobics without a step. So if these are not issues for you, this is a very good DVD."
5,Great Fun!,"My son is 21 months old and says only 2 to 3 words. After receiving Toots the Train he has progressed to now saying ""Go"" and ""Stop"". He received the toy for Christmas and plays with it every day several times throughout the day. It is simple enough that he can make it stop and go. He enjoys putting items in it's path and watches the train push it along. It keeps my son busy and entertained while I am preparing meals. Highly recommended!"
5,Great starter train for little hands!,"My son received this for Christmas last year (he was 2 then). He loved it right off the bat. Now, his 1 year old brother also loves it. Toots is great - can run on the track or just across the floor. Both of my boys have spent alot of time playing with this and it's held up well - even after being disassembled/reassembled twice. Only complaint - Fisher Price if you're listening - is that the train runs on 4 ""AA"" batteries - with a train of this size, you'd think they could've designed it to run off of ""C"" batteries or something - stock up on the ""AA"" cause Toots goes thru fuel fast! Otherwise a great toy."
1,not recommended,this toy to start was hard to get out of the box and after we put it together and put the train on the tracks we had a hard time getting the train to go. for a child almost 3 yrs old i think that they don't have the patients they want the train to just go and that's not the case here. the train also gets stuck and that's also very frustrating for my child. also we can't figure out how to use the remote control for it doesn't respond when you touch the buttons and speaking into the speaker.
4,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","A friend of my son's had this toy which became the focus of the ""mine"" game. He then received the toy as a gift on his 2nd birthday and was incredibly excited. The only problem was the engine wouldn't move. It made all the sounds but no movement. I exchanged it and after about a week had the exact same problem. We contacted Fisher Price who is now sending us a new engine. Hopefully this one will work, since three strikes and you're out."
1,Toots the train,"Well, it may have been a ""hot selling item"" but our ds barely played with it. All the train does it go round and round and became boring fast. NOT WORTH THE MONEY at all.I would not recommend this toy."
3,Doesn't work for long!!!!!,"My son received this toy last Christmas, and it was broken by July. It's not a cheap toy, so I expected it to last longer than that. It wasn't abused or anything. Toots still talks, but he won't move more than an inch. I contacted Fisher-Price because I think it should have a warranty, but they've never responded to my emails. I recommend that you buy brio trains and stay away from this clunker!"
4,Good Buy,I read the reviews before buying this toy to make sure it was a good deal and I have not been disappointed. My daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves playing with it. When she has friends over they love to play with it too.I would recommend this toy to any friends with children.
4,Fun but it Breaks!,"First let me say that my 2 year old loves this toy. He plays with it often. However, we are now on our third Toots car. The first one just quit working after 3 months. It does absolutely nothing. I called Fisher Price and they quickly sent me a new one, which worked for 3 DAYS. I called back and they sent me a third one. It has worked now for a couple of weeks. I wonder if there is a limit on how many they will replace. My cousin's has also broken once. This can not be just coincidence. Fisher Price has a great customer service line to call, but I hope I don't have to call it again."
3,Very deceptive advertising/box,"This is an OK toy - our 2.5 year old does play with it. I do however, feel that the packaging and television commercials are deceptive. The package shows a kid speaking into the microphone saying ""go to the station"" I feel this implies that there is some sort of voice recognition being used. In reality, you push the button on the microphone of where you want the train to go and it goes there. In addition, although the instructions say press the microphone button and say ""go"" or ""stop"" this is not necessary. If you push the microphone button and the train is stopped it goes - and vice versa. I'm pretty sure there is no microphone functionality at all - it's just a five button controller. Again, this is an OK toy - but I feel Fisher Price was very deceptive in how they packaged and advertised this toy and I would not have spend [price] on it had I known it did not function the way they presented it."
4,If you like trains this is a must!!!,"We bought this toy for my 3 year old son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He is a train fanatic so this was one more for his collection, but it is extremely durable, the tank engine has been dropped numerous times, so the toy is made really well. The tracks are pretty easy to snap together because they match up by symbols. The toy can get boring after a while, but what do you expect, that happens with most toys after all. I thought it was a very cute toy, my kids enjoy playing with it and its not broken yet which is a real plus!!!!"
3,"we've had two trains, neither has worked correctly","My 2 year old loves this train, when it works. He got the first one on Christmas, and it worked for about a month. After that, it would not respond to voice commands at all, and it went berzerk one night and just kept going, and going, and going, and would not shut off automatically as it was supposed to. After over an hour of this, I had to remove the batteries to get it to stop running around the track. I took that one back to the store, and got another one at a different store. We brought it home, and this engine won't work at all. I put new batteries in it, and tested the batteries on another toy, and they do work. I'm tired of returning this train, and tired of trying to explain to a two year old why his train is still broken. I am returning this one, and buying another brand. ..."
3,Not TOOOOOO HAPPY with TOOTS :(,"Toots does not follow instructions to STOP. Not good when you're trying to teach your toddler about stop and go. We think it probably has to do with how much noise the set makes as it's going around the track. It can't hear the commands said. We think that because it does start when you tell it to ""go"". Better to have a button to make it stop and go as opposed to voice activation.He likes the train. I would definitely have returned it if he didn't like it!"
5,The BEST present ever,This gift was a present for my 2yo grandson. I wondered about the practicality of it for his age. I shouldn't have. His eyes got wide as saucers and lit up like candles. It rates 5 stars for the fun factor. It rates 5 stars for eye/hand coordination <education> and I'm hoping that it will last forever. He couldn't get enough of it. It was a sight to behold. He loved it. I see this as something that he will never tire of. Once he got the hang of it he couldn't be stopped. His 7 yo brother loved it also. I think this is the best thing he has gotten to date. It brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend it if you want to be the hero <s>
4,How to balance your work and play,"No one their death bed ever said, ""I wish I had spent one more day in the office."" Waiting to play until you retire may be too late. We do not stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing. The author offers advice for re-invigorating your leisure life.It's time to take your play as seriously as your work."
3,Very good tv show but not enough episode (only four) when they said eight,"Very good show, I like to see how restaurant close of bankrupt can be alive again with the experience of Chef Ramsay.The bad thing is, they said 'eight' episodes, which is false. 5th to 8th are only the 10 minutes which Gordon Ramsay come back to restaurants, added to first to 4th episode. Kind of scam.Thank you"
3,Rasay's Kitchen Nightmares,The good thing: lots of cooking. The bad thing: renovations not as good as on the American version of the show.
5,Different in the UK,"I knew there are a lot of ""bleeps"" in the US. Here in the UK we hear the real details. I kind of like it :} More real, in the details, in my opinion"
5,Job done Gordon,"I absolutely love Gordon Ramsey and must say that the UK version of, Kitchen Nightmares, far exceeds the US version (and I'm a bloody American!)He just gets down to the brass tacks and goes about fixing the restaurants up! 5 stars to you Gordon and your cooking!!!"
2,2 studio releases and a b grade bside,"If you can find this aus release the most redeeming fact is you get a poster! This vesion however also comes in on of the god awful slide out plastic trays which always ruin the cardboard sleeve. There is a jewel case version of the single out there but it is particularly hard to find.Special Guide is the only bside on this cd, which sounds like the band liked 2 totally different riffs, lumped them together with one as a verse and one as a chorus which makes for a not very smooth song. The other song is whimsical which is straight off the album so overall not a great single."
3,Smells nice and herby,I'm totally in love with the flora nymphae fragrance. This however is a very nice herby scent. When I go in my garden in the morning and pick herbs this is what it smells like. A lot of mint in it. Dewy mint. It doesn't work on my skin unfortunatly. I am using it as an air freshner at my camp because it is a pretty scent for summer. Wish I loved it more.
4,Good...just not great.,"For starters, this DVD is only 40 minutes long. However, it has the best women surfers in the world. I was disappointed how little footage there was of Megan Abubo (since she is my personal favorite). None the less, this is an awesome DVD to add to your collection. This DVD really shows how far women's surfing has come along. A must for all surfers."
2,Hard to get past page 200,"I was given this book to read by my sister who has always had problems with her credit card debt. She said ""read this book if you want to know what is going on with debt in the world. Money is all just really debt back to the banks, it's all fake. This book exposes the whole fraud of the system.""The difficulty I had with this book is that it is very hard to follow the logic of the author and he seems to exaggerate everything.I got sick of it by about page 200 when the author just started repating himself for the 20th time that there is too much debt and the world is going to ruin. I skipped to the end. His only solution is government handouts of money to people in debt...Where that money comes from is not explained.I gave the author ** because he tries to tackle a serious problem, being rising levels of debt in the world, but he says nothing new or interesting about it and offers only an unrealistic solution to fix the problem."
1,Brainless twaddle,"This book proceeds from a number of basic misunderstandings, which are then amplified by speculation and exaggeration. The statistics quoted give the reader the feel that there is some scholarship involved - but this book would not have passed undergraduate peer review. Sad for the publishers, sad for the author. Exciting for some readers who think they have discovered a new economic tract, but this is twaddle of the lowest order - full of first-year undergraduate errors."
1,Worth reading,"I say worth reading because this book is an example of what claptrap can get published and read. Some semi-educated people will even take it seriously, if a few of the reviews here are to be believed. This book is a good case study in getting the wrong end of the stick and swinging it wildly in all directions. Worth a read - but be prepared for pages of dull and repetitious prose."
1,NOT good at ALL....,"Thousands of key changes?? I DONT think so....my entire 250 person dental school class was given these by the school as standard issue for our lockers. Some keys could open more than 3 different locks, and this was not an isolated incident either!!Well made padlock but hey, do YOU like the odds of how many locks a single key can open? If its ""thousands of key changes"" as the description states, we must have really REALLY REALLY weird luck.Just thought I'd share this because, quite frankly, it was ridiculous - most of us opted to buy ourselves a different lock."
3,Comanche was good and lots of fun,"Tanks okay, others were mediocre at best. Better off buying Abrams and Comanche, dump the rest. Look at Flight Sim and/or Abacus.IMHO"
1,Disappointed,I was never able to get the Comanche 4 game to load. Game Update does not work either I had to manually download the update from the web site and the game still does not load.
1,Gimme a break!,"This lady is no Shania Twain. The fake southern accent is embarrassing. Her voice is okay - not professional material, but okay nonetheless. But she is NOT from the South - please, lady, give up the fake southern accent. This is someone who would do better at pop (gag). My friend burned this CD for me because she likes Yvette's husband's band (the Nelson Brothers). Well, save your money, people. Wait until she comes out with a pop music Cd. Or better yet, get a CD by a REAL country music singer."
2,Not what I expected,"I regret not listening to samples before I bought the CD. To be honest, I only bought it because of her husband (I'm a big Nelson fan). I thought I would be supportive by buying the CD. Unfortunately, it's not what I expected. She has a beautiful voice and all, but there's nothing special/different about the CD. It sounds just like any other. I can't say I would recommend this, unless someone wants to buy it to donate more money to Nelson."
4,Not bad...I think I'm gonna like it.,"I absolutely ADORE Nelson, so I thought I'd listen to a ""Nelson by marriage."" After reading the reviews, I was leary on ordering it, but I thought - what the heck.Well, I'm listening to it now and, while I agree that the Southern accent is a bit much on some of the songs, it's really not a bad CD. She's got a pretty decent voice - nothing special, but certain not bad at all.I really like the songs and they are quite catchy. This is definitely going to be a fun driving-in-the-car CD.Bottom line: I recommend it. I'm not disappointed at all."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"This is superb comedy & timing based movie directed by Partho Ghosh.Overall, definitely worth a watch for the comedy and of course, Shamiksha."
4,Basic Grammar in Use Workbook,The workbook is a good supplement to the text if additional exercises are needed.
4,Bob Dylan Chronicles ready by Sean Penn,"This was actually a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He already had the book, but wanted the audio version because he couldn't find the time to sit down and read it. He told me that he wasn't so thrilled with Sean Penn's narration, that it was sort of monotone and needed a little more ""character""."
4,quick shipping,"Exactly what I ordered and shipped on time!! This stone is natural,no chemicals,and eliminates any irritations that can be caused by daily application of a deodorant"
4,great jacket,"The only issue I have is that its huge. I purchased a medium, I'm 6'3"", pretty slim and I'm swimming in this thing, the arms and general length is fine, but the space in the jacket could fit two more people. I wouldn't advise ordering a size smaller, because the length is fine, but I'm having taken in quite a bit."
2,It was WAY too big,"Their sizes are different than anywhere I've seen.It's a nice jacket, but I look like a kid putting on my Dad's coat!"
3,looks better on the picture,"MUCH better on the picture based on which it was selected to be purchased.the fabric is rather coarse, rough."
5,You Don't Own This Yet ?,"If you were ever in the US Navy, this is a must have.These are the Best ""Broadsides"" from the monthly Navy Times, I always went Straight to the Back Pages to read these first.Forever Funny."
1,These Must Be Serious Canadians Reviewing This,"I Love the Guess Who. Loved the complete albums. This ain't them. Burton's voice doesn't do what it did. If only they did new stuff that sounded different, it's still a great voice. Dionne Warwick is great...if she stays away from the hits. This did not excite me. I prefer the older DVD."
5,Timeless Talent,"My wife and I love this DVD and really are amazed at the depth of talent in the The Guess Who. If you listened to '70's rock, you will love this. Some lyrics were updated to accommodate the twenty year difference in the writing of the songs and this performance, which was well done."
4,Very Satisfied with DVD and Seller,"Recieved DVD as promised and it actually arrived before promise date. This is a great DVD of the Guess Who, picture quality and sound is good, not great but still worth getting. Would definitely recommend this Seller and this DVD."
3,Does he or doesn't he?,"The music is timeless as always. In the 60's and 70's most of us grew up, ""hearing"" the music and never seeing what the performers looked or acted like. One reviewer noted, ""Some people may consider Mr. Cummings a bit full of himself...but he's earned it if he comes across that way..."" What has he earned? The right to dye his hair black? My gosh man, you're almost 64 years old.... ... ...let a little northern grey wolf show... Burton does have that unique voice...you know immediately who's singing the song...All in all..a good concert...just follow the Randy Bachman credo and let yourself age... ...gracefully and a little less full of yourself...Burton...just sing the songs..."
5,One of the Best,"I've seen the beatles, Moody Blues, Dave Clark Five Herman's Hermits, Beach Boys Four Seasons to cover and review their concerts etc, but the Guess Who (Four seasons and beach Boys) are the top 3 concert performers for almost exact content as their released music.Voice wise.............the Guess who after all these years have held up the best..........if you've got Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings version of the group. This DVD rocks like it was back in the 60's. You can't go wrong if you want a true All original group at their best NOW."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING,I LIKED THE VIDEO BUT THE CONCERT WAS ALWAYS INTERRUPTED WITH A BIOGRAPY AND TALKING TO THE BAND. WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE STRAIGHT ROCK CONCERT.
2,Very good while it lasted,"Bought these tongs early in 2010, not heavily used, screw adjuster broke off in my hand, as I was lifting it from drainer on today's date."
3,Kitchen tongs come and go,"I like this product, for what it is. I don't use it often as I don't need it that often. The one time I used it, it did quite well. I don't like having to screw the holding device at the top, but other than that, it's a quality piece."
3,where's the automatic rewind?,"We bought this tape player without realizing that you have to hold down the rewind and fast forward buttons to get them to work; you can't just push rewind and wait for it to shut off. My four-year-old can't tell when the tape is finished rewinding, and anyway he has trouble holding the button down (the buttons are pretty stiff). He loves the look of this item, but we're taking it back because of the rewind problem. It's a shame, but holding the buttons down all the time just doesn't seem practical."
4,Not Tuff At All!,"I bought this product for my 3 year old son and the cassette door came off the second day we had it. It takes forever to snap the door back on, but it pops right back off at the slightest pressure. We have given up on the door and now just use the tape player without the door on. While shopping for a child's tape player, I chose this one over the other brands because it had the word ""tuff"" in it, leading me to think that it was more durable. Next time I'll choose Little Tikes. Very disappointing for the money spent on it."
3,Not what appears,"I purchased this for my daughter's 4th birthday. She loved it, but we discovered a MAJOR flaw. Its record button is blue and resembles the stop button and, when depressed, it will record over ANYTHING, even pre-recorded, professional audio tapes that have the ""erase prevention tabs"" removed. My daughter ruined several tapes before we figured out that it was not a freak accident with the purchased tapes. I would in no way recommend this for a young child for that very reason."
1,Very disappointed,"This is not designed well at all. The microphone does not stay in its place when not in use, the door does not come out far enough for an adult to easily take tapes out, let alone a toddler. In addition, the buttons are difficult to push. Don't waste your money on this. I expected far better from Fisher Price."
1,Sadly Disappointing,"I purchased this toy for my two grand-daughters, ages 2 & 5. The first time they used it the cassette ""door"" fell off and I couldn't for the life of me get it back on. My two grand-daughters were disappointed, which was not my intent. I am today taking it back. The ""educational"" value of this toy is that I won't purchase another Fisher Price boom box. Did Fisher Price child-test this toy? Evie Scott Kent, WA"
5,Another Excellant Value HIGH quality Fisher Price product,"After reading the negative reveiws that door comes off I started not to order this tape recorder for my grandchildren. We've had no problems with the door, it plays clearly. I am impressed. A great buy !"
2,Expensive toy,"Really now, is this really a fair price for a toddler toy? It should be priced alongwith other toys in the $30 to $40 range. White the toy is cute, it is far from perfect!Years ago this toy was $20 plus dollars.Another point I want to make is, I looked at all kinds of recorders and the customer reviews are horrible.Why is amazon selling these things."
3,review for tuff stuff tape recorder,"I think the toy is ok ,I was just a little upset that it was just put in a box and shipped there was only a piece of brown paper in with it, nothing to protect it from bouncing around and absorbing the shock of being dropped or thrown,Thankfully it does work even tho the voice,through the micro phone skips sometimes.:-["
4,OK deal at sale price,"My 2yrold and 6yrold both love the microphone/loudspeaker and taping their voice. It's cute, colorful, and they're having enough fun to justify buying it at the sale price.Just be advised: the rewind and forward buttons are reversed. And my son did accidentally pop the door off {right} after we unboxed it. But the Fisher-Price people had a quick, easy answer about how to put the door back on; and then when we could not get our tapes to play a few minutes later, they immediately offered and shipped a replacement. (They said not to bother returning the problem one. So now that I've finally figured out why it wouldn't work, and passed that info on to Fisher-Price, we've got 2 -- twice the deal.)"
2,Well Written but Pointless Novel,"Surface is a very well written but ultimately disappointing novel set in Northeast India that has had a history of insurgent violence that is both political but often borders on politics as justification for what amounts to organized criminal activity. The story centers on Amrit, a disaffected reporter for the Sentinel in Calcutta. After discovering and becoming captivated a photograph of a young woman who was possibly executed by an insurgent group for being in porn films, and having made contact with a supposed representative of a German magazine interested in a story on North East India, Amrit takes off to the region to uncover the story.While the prose is wonderful the novel itself is a disappointment. The story meanders from one scene to the next as Amrit uncovers the mystery of the young woman and the conclusion is unsatisfying as the reader wonders why either Amrit or the reader made this journey to begin with."
5,Highly Recommended,"I love everything about this lotion. It has a lovely, addictive smell, it's vegetarian and not tested animals (VERY important to me), it's paraben free (paraben being a cancer-causing chemical), and the alpha hydroxy acids work wonders for keratosis.I just purchased this lotion in the last month, and the bottle says ""New Improved Hydration"" in the upper left. I'm very happy with it."
3,"Great, but not worth the price.","I love it, don't get me wrong. But it's no better than a bottle of St. Ives, which is cheaper."
1,THE NEW IMPROVED FORMULA IS HORRIBLE!!,"I had been using Alba Botanica very emollient body lotion for close to 25 years and loved it, in fact it was the only body lotion that I wanted to use because it made by skin silky soft, but now that they have IMPROVED the formula it's not as good. I have stopped buying it, and will miss the old wonderful original formula!! The Shea Butter is not an IMPROVEMENT!! It feels pasty now."
2,Medicinal scent,"This may be good lotion, but I will not use it because I really disslike the scent. I tried giving it to my mother, but she wont use it for the same reason."
2,Smells Like...,"...an old lady. Sorry to say it, and no offense to old ladies, but it has that weird rosy gardenia smell that just kinda smells like you're trying to cover up another smell. Anybody know what I'm talking about? Maybe it's just me, but I find it really unpleasant."
1,New formula for Maximum Dry Skin Formula is Disappointing!,"I've used the old formula for years with great pleasure (even when it contained parabens) and am terribly dismayed that it has changed into yet another ho-hum product. The old one had glorious slip, perfect penetration and a delightful light scent for massaging clients. This new one has little slip at all, little penetration, and necessitates using twice the amount of lotion.I will NOT reorder it again. Yet another perfect product bites the dust probably in the name of money. Frankly, I would pay more for the old, original product. Shame on Alba/Hain/Celestial Co. I will complain directly to them as well - have done so in the past as they changed/ruined another product that I'd enjoyed for years."
2,Not impressed,"I have never bought this before, or even used the brand but after reading most of the reviews decided to give it a try. Not impressed... It smelled alright (kind of manish though), but it was greasy and never absorbed. I gave it to a friend, and she didn't care for it either... she gave it to her daughter, same result. I'm sad that I wasted the money."
4,"Great Product, Arrived Broken","I have been using this lotion for a while and love it, so I have nothing bad to say regarding the product itself. It is very moisturizing and sensitive, and lacks all the yucky things they put in products these days (parabens..sulfates...) But, unfortunately when it arrived the cap part was open and it had leaked in the package and the nozzle part won't pop up properly. Alas!"
3,New formula smells strange,"I first tried this lotion at my brother's house. I really loved the way it felt and smelled so I decided to order a bottle for myself and one for my mom since she loved the lotion as well. When I received my order, I noticed right away that it smelled different. I checked my mom's bottle and it too smelled different. It smells kind of old, stale. The only other way to describe it is like medicine. I'm on the subscribe and save program, but I'm thinking of canceling. I love the lotion, but I'm not too thrilled about the new scent. Before I cancel, I'm contacting Alba Botanica to see if this is normal. Maybe I just got bottles from a bad batch."
2,Extremely Disappointing New Formula,"I loved the old Alba lotion, especially the scent. While the lotion itself is okay, so much of the pleasure of using Alba was the almond scent. I honestly don't think I like the product enough in its new form to continue buying it. I am extremely disappointed with Alba for this seemingly needless alteration of their original formula.ALBA: PLEASE say this is just some jerk move like New Coke, and that you will bring old Alba very emollient lotion back soon."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"I bought this lotion because I was looking for something not tested on animals. This is the ""new improved"" formula with the aqua-blue and spring-green lettering on the bottle. It leaves a greasy film on my skin that I have to wipe off with a tissue. My skin doesn't feel hydrated at all. It smells like gardenias, but I think the fragrance is a little too strong. I bought a really big bottle - my mistake! The search continues."
4,Celtic Ring,Beautiful ring and at a very good price. It is a thin band though and is very easily bent.
1,Horrible taste,"Nothing against the seller, the product arrived fine and on time. But this has to be the worst protein supplement I've ever tried. This cookies & cream flavor is garbage. Tastes like liquid cookie dough and it mixes poorly. Its impossible to consume a full serving at once. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this flavor."
3,Ehhh...,"It's not terrible but not nearly good. There is WAY too much sugar per serving(around 55g) compared to the amount of protein. I know it's a weight gainer but oh my god... Too sweet for my taste.As far as it's performance for gaining weight, I suppose it works decently well. However, I do not like the amount of the servings it contains. There is only 8 servings in the whole container. The scoop inside the bucket is HUGE! It's like the size of a dog food scoop lol. On top of that, the directions suggest to use TWO scoops per serving. You gotta be kidding me! So in that regard, in order to save money, I used only half of the suggested use so I won't use it up in a week.I would say in about 2 1/2-3 weeks, I gained about 8-10 lbs. Not bad but I can do better."
5,pretty good,"anybody who says this gainer taste bad had to be new to protein shakes or use to muscle milk which hands down is the best tasting protein shake ...but this one is not bad if you add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to your shake it can even make it enjoyable...if your looking to increase the calorie intake add oats there about 150 calories for a half cup so if you take two shakes that's a bonus 300 calories adding a cup of ice cream depending on the brand is additional 300 calories and if you add eggs and blend correctly you can't taste them and that will boost your protein intake add any type of fruit for fiber and you have the ultimate mass gainer in my opinion, okay I've been taking it for a week now and I don't know what ingredient it is but this shake makes me so sluggish after I take it which makes it impossible to take at any time during the day except for when im.about to go to sleep"
2,Too sweet for me,"I was stoke to find this so cheap, but after my first drink (1 half a serving size) I couldn't stand the amount of sugar in it. It has twice as much per serving as something like Serious Mass. I ordered the Serious Mass on subscription for a comparable savings. I hope it works better for me."
3,taste good,"fast shipping, good taste, i ll back with more about the performance. it is working so far but not as good as other products from the same brand"
2,Fairly Obvious Conclusions With Interesting ROIs,This book is definitely not for Webmasters or anyone familiar with interactive media development except so far as it can serve as an introduction to suit-talk (how to persuade your boss to go all the way).The first two chapters were interesting but in both case studies the task at hand was fairly obvious and didn't present any real breakthroughs in networking the work environment.Sorry for the poor review. I was expecting more.
4,Barbara dickson songbook all the hits and more .,"great find love this cd great tracks but oddly enough one song which was a her first big hit (a Nat King Cole song) in the uk in the mid seventies ANSWER ME is not on this collection . Everyother song around the mid seventies and eighties are here including live medley of songs of Motown ,Dusty Springfied and more."
1,Ship to me product that expired in a month !,"Get 2 packs today. One expired Jan, 2010 and the other expired May 2010 !! Feel cheat by the seller."
3,Disappointed,"Though i am a full-fledged Christian and believe in the importance of God's word, there was too much filler as scripture without specific instruction on how to implement the ideas posed."
5,Where has Dana been all my life?,Dana Carpender writes a great page turner...even a cookbook! Recommend to all who have different family quotas of carbs for dinner!
2,Photos would have been nice...,"Its ok. The main reason I got this cookbook, based on the title, is to avoid excessive sugar, or, hopefully, to cut it out completely. The cookbook offers carbs and useable carbs, as a total, but doesn't list sugars specifically. Also, I would have prefered some photos. Its functional, I would go to this book with a mission or a plan. Its not something I will leisurely look through for ideas."
1,could be better,"I got the camera as a gift, so I can't really return it, or I would. I'm not a very good at technology, and the manual that came with the camera did not help me one bit. I'm used to a manual zoom, I do not like the &amp;quot;smart zoom.&amp;quot; Also when I take a picture, the LCD screen goes black. So the 2-3 seconds that it takes the camera to take a picture, I don't even know what I'm taking a picture of! The memory card that comes with it, only holds 11 picures. All of the accessories for the camera are way too expensive......"
3,So-so,"I've been using this camera for about 2 years now. You'll fine that the zoom is incredible small. However, don't let that fool you, this little camera is great for at night shooting.The options on the camera is lovely for its little cybershot-self. However, if you want to do some professional shooting, this is NOT the camera.The photos do come out lovely, but the lighting often comes out all wrong! To be a user of this camera, you might have to be friendly with Photoshop or some kind photo editing program.The other con's of this camera is that the battery often runs out. It takes a lot of power to run the camera and the LCD (There's an option to turn the LCD screen off). The memory slot gets dusty very easy, and when that happens, it often leads to complication...like the one's I'm having now. The camera often can not read the memory stick!However, despite all its con's: this is a lovely camera for just snapshots! Nothing professional on it."
1,"A moronic camera, useless, terrible software.","Admittedly, I am a novice with higher end cameras, but the lack of a zoom feature makes this camera worthless in my view. I was unable to take any quality photos at the zoo except for closeups. Software is hideous. There is no reason to purchase this camera."
1,You're kidding right?,"Maybe good for the price (in which people look at three megapixels and the price and jump for joy thinking they have gem in their hands) Maybe. I sell digital cameras and there is absolutely no justification in buying this camera, mostly because the camera simply cannot zoom at its 3.2 megapixel setting, and its digital zoom available at other settings is decidedly horrible. Why not just buy the p52 or p72.. not much more in price, yet actually allow you to frame a picture without resorting to walking right up the subject's eye ball. And why earth does everyone seem to l ike the ugly cybershot design? I mean I know its all opinions, oh nevermind. Pictures we've printed under halogen lights at work are not even close to as good as similiar pictures from competing canon, nikon and fuji model...A70/A60 3100 3800 and far worse than the typical 4 by 6 stills from the various kodak models."
3,Don't forget about Sony service,Up until a few days ago I would have rated this camera 5 stars. But then the buttons on the back of the camera ceased functioning. Sony quoted me a flat rate of $185.11 to fix the camera. Good thing I can buy a brand new one for $199.87. The questions is should I?
1,Stopped working after 5 months.,"I got this camera as a birthday present in December 2003. If I had written a review last week, I probably would have given it 4 stars. But all of a sudden, it was unable to take pictures. The lens flutters and opens partially, but not all the way, and I get an error message to ""turn the power off and on again."" Well, needless to say that didn't work. I can still view pictures on the memory stick, but that's about it. Customer support could not explain it, so they said to send it in for servicing. Since I've had it past 90 days, I will have to pay for the labor estimated at $139. If it is deemed a non-warranty problem, then I will need to pay much more. Well, I may as well buy a brand new camera. So, unfortunately, this camera was a costly ""disposable."" Not sure I would buy this camera again."
1,Erases pictures off the memory stick!!,I received this as a gift. It is missing any type of zoom at the 3.2 level. I have several sizes and brands of memory sticks and it will erase my pictures. I took pictures at Xmass. I was about to leave and decided to take one more group shot and bamm. the camera when crazy and sure enough for the 3rd time in 4 months it erased all the pictures on that memore stick. This camera almost went through the window but it was not my house!! I will toss this thing in the garbage and I will pick up anything non-sony!! Sony support was not helpfull and they made me go past my 90 day return so the store would not take it back. This camera lost important pictures of Xmass and my first born child and a trip to visit a great grandma who may not be around anymore. If you want the camera.. I will give it to you for free!!!
5,Great diet for busy people!,I always wanted know how healthy the products which I buy in supermarkets are. This book explains it is short and simple way.
4,"Awesome,Awesome,Awesome!!!","A great little gadget.Pros:Fairly Small and Light for a unit with a HD.20GB storage for music and other files.Easy to setup and useGreat Sound (not with the supplied headphones)Cons:Battery indicator not reliablePictures and video grainy - no flash, you need a lot of light for clear video or pictures.[Bad] headphonesMenu Screen flickers (not during video)Overall I am very happy with my purchase!!! The cons are mainly minor annoyances, but I would not buy it for the camera/video options alone... But for the rest, BUY IT!"
2,Good Concept Bad Manufacturing,"Product has great features, but the quality of the unit is poor. If jolted, the unit will lock up and need to be returned. I've gone through 3 units in the past two months. Also, there are some minor problems with the firmware, which causes the unit to skip songs on occation. I suspect these will be fixed in future firmware releases which are on the company's web site. I found updating the firmware very easy. Other negatives--directions are poor and it is tough to create playlists."
2,Good Product - When it works!,"Mine has broken twice now, the same error in both cases. The screen just dies. The first time it took me forever to get to tech support. I was put on hold for 45 minutes! Finally I got an RMA and shipped it back. Turn around was only one month :( they promised 2 weeks max. This last time it went out was after the one year warranty. I would call them up and ask them how much to repair but frankly... I don't want to be put on hold for another 45 minutes while calling a long distance number (no 800 number available & they don't respond to emails) just to be told that the repair costs will be +-100 dollars. I would rather give that 100 dollars to the junkie that lives on the street in the nearby city. He might get more 'user satisfaction.'PS - If you do buy one and something does go wrong... Don't call during lunch time (Pacific Time) because the entire support staff goes out to luch at the same time and they just put you on hold."
1,Dodgy Product Steer Clear,"I bought this after having bought the Archos Recorder (WhichUltimately Fell Apart Literally, Paint Peeling, Buttons Falling Off, Power Connector Falling Off,Screen Stopped Functioning).Would not power on after a night of recharging contacted tech support after 2 weeks never received an answer, boxed it back up and sent it back to the reseller.Like all Archos products you get the same thing, poor tech support, poor updates, dodgy devices (This is why a group of unfortuanate Archos owners wrote their own firmware for some of the devices because Archos could never get the firmware fully functional).If you can buy something else do it. Whomever thinks Archos can get a multimedia player right when they CANNOT even get an MP3 player down has to be out of their minds! They add more functions sure but, carry the same problems from their former devices and add more problems to boot. Also one other thing to note the battery IS NOT replaceable in this device."
1,not happy,"First one, hard drive had a bad habit of freezing up. Took it back and within the first day the second one started freezing up and within a week it wouldn't even power on. I emailed Archos about the problem and they wouldn't respond. Took it back and got another brand. Won't buy an Archos again."
2,It's a great player... I just wish the batteries would last,"The unit itself plays music very well, and you can make playlists and store a vast amount of files.However, over the 8 months that I have had my player, I have had to send it in to get repaired 3 times for the same problem--after charging it for the whole night, the battery fails after one hour, though it's supposed to last for 8. Since this seems to be a reoccuring problem I would not recommend this mp3 player."
4,pretty good,"got this thing for a month, overall it performs well...the battery does drain out fast cuz of the LCD screen. however it does have some problems with the USB connection when I tried to plug this gadget at my school's mac computer(OS9). some weird warning popout said there ain't got enough battery or power outlet or whatever to match this computer power voltage...something like that I forgot what it said exactly, but I did fully charged my jukebox and everything seems running fine in both my PC and mac(OSX) and home. oh well, overall I think this product is pretty good overall at its price(when they priced at $(...) or something) with all those functions"
4,"Versatile, nice screen, great sound","I really like this player. It plays video files in addition to mp3s. The screen is very bright, but put a protector over it, as it scratches easily. Battery life is okay, lasts about 4-5 hrs playing videos. Bulkier than an iPod."
1,totall unreliable,"HiThis is my second posting on this after less than 3 months mine has now virtully given up the ghost - the display screen is split into 2 displays - keep getting hard drive errors and , tracks do not appears on the listings , breakup on the MP3 files - its on its way back ..."
1,STAY AWAY FROM ARCHOS,"I've had two archos portable hard drives (The Jukebox Recorder 20 and a 60GB QDisk) crash on me with no warning. It was a completely unrecoverable situation on both of them. Archos customer service offered ABSOLUTELY no support. In fact when I called them to find out what to do to see if I could recover anything, the first thing they did was tell me immediately that they weren't responsible for any data. The second thing they told me was that I should just buy a new one. The first time I spent $1000 on data recovery. Shame on me for not backing it up. The second time, I'm backed up. It's just going to cost my time shopping for a new portable hard drive, and putting the data back together. I will NOT be purchasing an Archos EVER AGAIN FOR ANY REASON."
4,This Device Does It All!,"Very cool device that does a lot for the money. The color monitor is very sharp, albiet small. It is very easy to drag and drop files to the device. My only complaint is that the battery life is not near the 8 hours touted in the specifications. If you use it at work like I do invest in a second DC/AC adapter."
1,Beware of Archos reliability,I've had two Archos jukeboxes now and they are very unreliable. My first one broke down totally within a year with lots of problems in between. The other was defective within the first month and had to be replaced. The replacement was notoriously unstable.I've been very unimpressed with the company's customer service and would warn anyone buying anything from Archos to be prepared for problems. The machines are cool with lots of capability....but not worth the money given the reliability problems.
2,Nice features but poorly built,Featurewise this is a nce machine and lcd screen although very small but you can view video very well. But it is poorly built and equally bad is Archos customer service.One of the buon my juke box dislodged after a month of use and it is not workig now and I can not access features controled by this button(F2) n.If I have to do this again I won't spend money on this piee of junk.
1,Poor Quality,"In less than a year, I've had two that have broken. Enough is enough. Quality is extremely poor."
2,Opt for the iPod,"The Archos Multimedia Jukebox seems like a good idea, but its falls short of the promise. The tiny LCD screen isn't practical for watching video and only passable for viewing images. Sound gets distorted at average volume levels and it can't get loud enough to compete with subway noise. It does hold a lot of data and works as a hard drive as well, as an MP3 player, but the Apple iPod is far superer and worth the extra money."
2,just a con,this is my second review . video transfering from pc to the jukebox is ridiculous anything over 1gb takes 30-45 min . hell it can be watched in half of that time and also a 3.77gb video that lasts 22mins takes 10mins to open up and im still counting as i write this
1,A liberal political agenda minus the proper information.,"First let me say that all previous books were very well written and lived up to the rave reviews. However ""The Street Lawyer"" lost all interest for me after the second reference to the eeeevil Republicans not taking care of us all from cradle to grave. I shall not read another John Grisham book."
3,Not the best or the worst,"If you are a fan of Susan Minot then you will like this book. I would not suggest ""Rapture"" as an introduction to her writing. I enjoyed it because I love her style of writing and the characters she portrays so accurately."
3,"Light on titillation, heavy on introspection","The book is based around a single sex act, but the majority of text focuses on both Kay and Benjamins' thoughts as the sexual encounter is going on. They go back in time and remember their own thoughts and feelings toward each other, and as the book progresses each of them seems to be going in different directions emotionally, only meeting up physically in chance encounters along the way. Kay doesn't love him, then she does. Benjamin loves her, then he doesn't.It is a depressing book, you get the impression that they are isolated within their own thoughts, yet all they want is someone to truly understand them. They are looking for love, but accepting sex as a viable alternative."
4,The Mystery Finally Solved...,"Among the many images and insights that moved me or resonated with me on a personal level, is the answer to a question that has frustrated me -- and I'd imagine many other women -- for years. Why do men cheat? Why profess to be ""in love"" with one woman and yet choose to ""settle down"" with another? Why would a man abandon passion in favor of a relationship that is informed by bland, blunted things that are the inverse of passion, pure emotion, and romantic love? Shouldn't these be the elements propelling us towards finding ""The One""? Minot hits the nail on the head in a single paragraph towards the end, offering a subtle, sympathetic, and very astute answer to one of life's most heartbreaking mysteries. The truth hurts -- but I was grateful for the insight, and curiously comforted by it."
1,Did Not Like This Book,"Yes, although I started reading this book and had many feelings of identification, it became most boring and repetitive and I did not want to commit to even continue reading this short book.I jumped to the last few pages just to see how it ended. Glad I did not spend the time to read the whole book"
1,Literary Poise?,"Is this sytle and content of writing the real heart of literature today? If so, print is truly dead. Susan Minot is accomplished in her technical and grammatical talents, but this story is wholly unoriginal and uninteresting.Watch a daytime soap opera and imagine it transported to late night HBO. The real test of any good book (or film) is the question - after it has been experienced - ""Do I want that time back?"" The answer, for this book, is definitely in the affirmative. Save your money and your time."
2,slender,"Ms. Minot's previous work has been so fantastic, so rich, so full and complex, that I was anxious to get my hands on her newest effort. However, using a sex act as the present-time premise of the entire novella proves itself an unstable, weak, and ultimately tiresome conceit. The ""goods"" of the piece all take place in the past tense, in reverie and flashback. This keeps the reader away from feeling any urgency in the text, and ultimately, nothing is at stake for these characters. Ms. Minot's writing is sharp, and her power of description formidable, but the characters remain cardboard, and the premise feels empty and vacuous."
1,Trite and boring,"This doesn't even make a good short story, never mind a hardcover novella. Woman gives an ex-lover a blowjob, and we get intermittent remembrances and consideration of their neuroses and past. But it's not even an interesting past, just a minor affair! If I have ever read a more mundane book about sex and relationships, I can't remember when."
1,waste of money,"The title of the book is attractive. That's why I purchased a copy. Other than that, the book could be easily summarized on one page with a couple good suggestions. Otherwise, it feels like a con-job, and a waste of money."
1,waste of money for sure,"This is perhaps the worst book I ever bought.If you happen to not know that you need a ""table of content"" in a book then you probably need this book.Just to give a flavor of the quality of the content of this book, this is the ""advice"" given by the author on writing introductions (p28)""Just say what the book is about, what gives you the right to write about it, why you wrote the book, who it is for, etc.This will probably take at least two page and maybe many more.This is the point where you will start using both side of the paper""and that's it!Very informative, no?I guess that by selling this book this guy is just trying to make the point that ""you don't need any real advice on how to write a book, just do it.""well my point is that certainly nobody needs spending money on advices like the ones give in this book which, in my humble opinion, are all simplistic and at best uninformative."
2,Order the next bigger size!,"I ordered a size US 10, but it fits way too snug, and I can only get the strap to the first notch. The ChampsSports return policy is more trouble than it's worth. Save yourself some grief and order a size larger."
1,not good,HBO should have just captured the live show in its entirety instead of filming those cheesy fourth wall breaking interstitials with the writer. I fast forwarded through 25% of the DVD and just watched the monologues.
2,More obnoxious than creative.,"I found this HBO special nauseating, with each monologue worse than the previous. Ensler's presentation tried to generate enpowerment of and sensitivity to women. For me, it failed, and I just could not get past the yuckiness and nonsense of it all. The snippets of real interviews conducted that were the basis for her play and even her short interspersed commentary were much more enjoyable than the actual monologues. 2 stars for those brief portions, zero kudos for the rest.I am far from a prude and am open to all genres of expression. However, what I found here was an bunch of extremely silly material for people who think themselves artistically progressive. Unfortunately, this makes the rest of us wanna roll our eyes and scratch our heads wondering why we bothered to waste our time to view and consider it."
1,"for women only,... for women over 50",This is not for any man unless in his 90s or men that need an education on an over-rated subject.If you are thinking comedy like Sarah Silverman or Whoopi Goldberg forget about it.We all dove to hit the eject button the first two minutes of the first monologue.Total middle-aged chick flick.
2,something's audibly wrong,"watched the local performances here three times. eve even got to visit a local bookstore to promote one such performance and sign some books. was quite excited to have the dvd finally. however, when i watched it, there seems to be something wrong with the audio. it started good then turned bad when the words you hear are not in synch with the video images that you see. hope that some other reviewers get to place their own comments here. i'm not sure if this is just a fluke dvd that i have or if it's the same for the other dvds out there."
4,4.5 Stars,"I loved the vagina monologues. It is so freeing and honest and painful. I believe it is truly a gift and I am lucky to have seen it. It can be a bit shocking and would certainly turn some people off. For me, however, I feel it is a work of art. What a powerful way to address unspoken topics!!I didn't give it 5 stars because it is not something I would watch over and over again--which is usually the criteria I would use for buying a DVD. However in this case, I felt the material was so good that even if I only watch it a few times, it is worth owning. (I think I have watched it 3 or 4 times).Thank you Eve Ensler for you work. I am grateful."
1,horrible!!!,What a disappointment! Jean Carne is oe of the best vocalists of the 70's and a true talented diva. Here is a self produced album that is so takky and boring that you understand why it was never aired. Only for collectors to buy it!
1,Potential,"I bought this book as a gift. It wasn't clear from the reviews that it was not a ""book"" but a comic book. However, the biggest problem was that it was a book about a young girl's lesbian experience in high school! (Not that there is anything wrong with that. I just wish that I had known that fact before I purchased the ""book."")"
4,"very soft leather, fits well even if you are well endowed",was werary about ordering a one size fits all as I am well endowed but it fits great and the leather is soft quality leather. Very comfortable would recomend it to anyone who's looking to spice things up a little.
5,Too abstract for mainstream?,"If it were not for Amazon's computer recommendations, I would not have known that this brilliant album is available...on mp3. [Since I am one of those whose ear and stereo hardware can distinguish mp3 from the better wav CD format, I normally do not look in the mp3 section.] This is a very fine album in both music and performance. The Brubeck team was continuing its unusual time explorations and improvised melodies, so key to this period of ""progressive jazz"". Except for one song, there are no catchy tunes, no memorable tour de force; instead, there is just superb playing and musical poetry, especially that smooth, unique sound of Paul Desmond. I would like to have those helpful liner notes found with CDs, but meanwhile all Brubeck fans should download the mp3 files for a surprisingly underrated album."
5,Excellent Guitar. Good Price,"Excellent Guitar. I was impressed by the Nice bright tones, and the quality of product . Good Price for a beginner to medium guitar."
5,Great bang for the buck!,This is a great sounding guitar for the inexpensive price tag. This is the perfect acoustic guitar for the beginner player.
5,*Free trade and organic certified* !! Choice Blackberry Tea!,"Some of the finest tea I've had. It is a pleasure on the palette, as well as to the nose. In addition to the wonderful taste and aroma, this tea (The Choice Organic Tea line) is ""Fair Trade"".This tea is caffeine free and delicious hot or cold. --> i have added 2 bags when brewing in the sun for iced tea. Delicious, when sweetened with natural honey!It is important to believe in a product, and this one uses as many Fair Trade ingredients as possible."
5,Lots-o-fun!,"It is so hard for me to get my husband to do anything with the family because he is either in a field or up a tree, so I thought it was GREAT to bring the field to the table! Thanks for such a great product!! I ordered it for his birthday and it arrived in a timely fashion and in excellent condition which helped make it the perfect gift!!"
1,Watch out - Not exactly Greatest Hits!,"If you read the tracklisting, you'll notice right away that all of the songs on this so-called greatest-hits album are taken from Nate Dogg's debut album ""G-Funk Classics vol. 1&2"" that was released in 1998. What about a few songs from Nate's second album - ""Music and me""?... And more important - What about some of the unforettable guest appearences he's dropped on albums by artists like 2Pac,Dr. Dre, Snoop and the whole DPG Posse, Ludacris, Fabulous and just about every succesful rapper these days?... So, I don't know what's the deal with this album - who's releasing it, and why is it called greatest hits... I LOVE Nate Dogg's music, the man has undeniable talent, but this IS NOT a Greatest Hits album, so save your money for the real thing. Hey, even the album cover looks kinda corny and cheap!... I'm not even sure Nate Dogg himself has any control over this album..."
5,"A Wiccan Bardo, Revisted: initiation and self-transormation","I have always considered myself Wiccan. For as long as I can remember I have have special insight to things I could not explain. However, I did not know which way to go on my journey. I enquired about joining The Rowan Church and it was suggested that I read this book first. I am glad I did, it takes the mystery out of what I thought or expected. I am now more at ease about joining this church and following this Wiccan path."
2,close but not OEM,"I have an 85 cj7, I tried this cover and could not get it to stay on. I have been meaning to warm it up with some hot water and see if it will flex and lock into the port better. This one just isn't flexable enough to lock in the way its suppose to."
1,Wouldn't Reccomend,"This movie has no sex at all, it is just girls walking around with their tops off, no action wouldnt reccomend this movie."
2,a book with something to offer,"""Nothing"" has something to offer. If you're looking for a very easy to follow guide to the tenants of Zen Buddhism, Mr. Sloman's book might be of interest to you. Zen Buddhism states that suffering on this earth is caused by illusion and attachments. The more detached you come from these things, the less you will suffer. Mr. Sloman repeatedly drives these tenants home, through many examples from various religious traditions. If you can at least intellectualize theses tenants, ""Nothing"" might seem more than a little repetitious to you. For those of you who meditate regularly already, reciting one's mantra will probably help you more than ""Nothing"" will."
2,Okay -- but buggy?,"I've had the DI-701 for about six months and when it works, it's great. It took forever to get PPPoE support, and all the bios updates have been ""beta"" -- read ""unsupported."" I have a lot of trouble with ftp and e-mail -- can't send long e-mails or ftp send file (yes, even in PASV mode, d-link). It also seems that every time I flash the bios (had to do it about 10 times so far), it takes an inordinate amount of restarting my dsl modem and the di-701 to get them to talk. The telnet configuration does not match the gui configuration (if you do a ""renew"" from telnet, it tells you you're not set up to get your dhcp configuration from your ISP. Sweet!) In short, I'm dumping this and getting the Linksys 1-port DSL router; I'll post a comparative review in a few months over there. Should that fail, I'm going to turn an old P-75 into a Coyote Linux box and do it myself."
2,May be good for basic users,"While I had better luck with the support department than Henry, It was determined that I could not use Nortel's extranet VPN client. Other problems I saw was a limitation to how many ports you could open up (16 max). So if you need 2 ports open on 9 PC's, you're ""doomed"" even though it will support 32 pc's. I ended up returning mine and ordering a Linksys which my IT department states will work with my VPN."
1,"Dont bother if you need IPSec, security or Netflix 0-star",I have had this unit (DI-701) for a year or so and recently found a problem in addition to the security hole thats posted here.I upgraded to the newest firmware 4.10 because I needed the IPSec protocol that the 4.06 didnt have and it seems to work fine until I tried to access Netflix.com. The unit totally halts. All lights stay on and the unit cannot be found through its configurator. I have to recycle the power to the unit to get it back up and running again.I called tech support and they told me to call Netflix and ask them what ports they are using to send back http requests. I told him that Netflix didnt have a tech support since they do not provide hardware. And it shouldn't be the case since I was able to access Netflix with the 4.06 firmware. Who knows what other site it cannot access. So to the recycling bin it goes!
2,not really a sharing router,"this does not directly enable sharing, unless you have an additional piece of hardware called a hub. i also experienced the loss of connectivity described by others, and am returning the item to amazon.(com)"
2,Price is great...when it works.,"I've been using my router for a few months now, sharing our cable connection through out the house.Though the price is GREAT, it doesn't work consistenly. It often loses the connection, and only regains it when you unplug the unit, and wait a minute before plugging it back in.This happens at least once an hour with heavy traffic. A true impossibility for those of us staying connected to a gnutella network, downloading large files, or connecting to an outside server.I'm very disappointed with this product and am leaving this review as I sift through routers looking for a NEW ONE!"
3,Review update,"On a wild chance I tried the latest firmware upgrade from Dlink. It does indeed work with the 3com shark fin modem now. Furthermore they have made telnet management of the device optional (the default is off) thus plugging up a vulnerability on the device.I still would not recommend this product to anyone who might need technical support from Dlink however, but the device itself has run for several days without choking. My strictly empirical tests seem to indicate a faster connection now that I removed WIN 98 SE's ICS. However this could be due to the variability of the bandwidth inherent in a cable connection."
1,Why Bother,"I wrote a very uncomplementary review about this box revealing a MAJOR defect which renders the box useless (if not worse - because users think they are protected).Your not publishing same and not contacting me re verification of statements made ( which you can REDILY verify for yuorself with simple test) not only impunes the veracity of ALL your reviewers but worse, leads me to question your basic honesty. An honest merchant might delay printing such a review for a while to verify the staements made but you have failed!hank"
5,Pumpkin Lovers!,"I absolutely LOVE pumpkin, but I didn't know how to cook with fresh pumpkin. This book is excellent for not only providing instruction on how to cook fresh pumpkin but it also gives unique and wonderful recipes. There are some traditional recipes, such as a variety of pumpkin soups, however, there are others like risotto and pumpkin gratin. So if you love pumpkin and like to try new things... this is a wonderful book that is easy to use!"
1,Monroe Makes great Shocks.,"I have to rate these shocks below top of the line because they were incorrect for my vehicle. I did not look at the shocks when the arrived, assumed they were correct because I ordered them based on the description online. Maintenance day I had the old shocks off, the vehicle on stands, opened the boxes and to my surprise....WRONG!!!!, minor let down...just went to the local auto parts store....picked up another set of Monroe Shocks....higher priced...yet it made a difference in the ride quality of my 88 Bronco II."
3,"I mean... it's a cheap wig. It looks like a cheap wig, because it's a cheap wig.","If you're looking for fabulous, you should probably look above the $10-20 price point. These people make money off of these wigs, which mean they probably cost about .07c to make. So, if you want something cheap and easy for a costume you'll wear once, buy it. You'll still be a little disappointed when you bring it out of the bag, but then you'll remember that it's a cheap wig & it's your own fault for not buying the $30 wig.If you're into wigs, you're probably not even reading this review because you're off at a high-priced wig shop.Basically, learn to live with the decisions you make."
5,Sunset Heights,"This CD is incredible ,Vince Converse is a master of his craft,Playing the Blues,) the dude just blows me away. He was about 20 yrs old when this CD was released, he was Great then & now he's a Master,& I was very happy w/ the delivery of this item..VERY HAPPY ALL THE WAY AROUND!! & TX TEA "" is awesome.."
4,AlfredHitchcock Season 5,A lot of fun shows on 5 discs. Hours of vintage entertainment. The whole family will enjoy by watching one episode or several during the evening. Excellent quality and sound.
4,Opens window to city Hell.,"Excellent writing. Preferred the Hip Hop history aspect. With that, my problem is how can you talk about hard-core without a single mention of Public Enemy? Like talking about British Invasion without mentioning the Beatles."
3,Same ole Same,"I nearly passed on this book thinking it was a 50 cent bio. Once I began flipping through the pages I quickly found this not to be the case. One of the more indearing things about this book is the manner in which the author deals with each of the characters honestly. All to often in a book of this sort the author fails to remain objective and the main characters assume super human status. That is not the case here. Much to the credit of the author he sticks to the facts and avoids repeating some of the more outlandish urban tales surrounding Fat Cat, Pappy Mason and the Supreme Team.In short this book is well written, researched and edited. Very much worth the purchase price if for no other reason than the integrity factor involved in sifting through the lies, myths and legends associated with the likes of the cast of characters."
2,Not as shown on website,"I have used a friend's Pressman bingo set for years and finally decided to purchase my own. The problem is that the set has been ""updated"" and the newer version isn't the same as the older version or as shown on the website. The updated 'cage' isn't a problem, but the plastic board that you place the called numbers isn't the same and doesn't work well. The old plastic version had little pegs that you inserted the called ball onto and they stayed firmly in place. The 'new' version has a thin piece of cardboard with holes punched out that lays on a table and you place the balls on the punched out space. Problem is that if the card moves or the table is bumped.....there roll all your numbers off the cardboard. The image on the website isn't great and the box appears to be the exact same as the old version, so just be aware of the called numbers ""holder""!"
1,Poor Design,"For our purposes, we were able to use the game as needed. I know it was cheap, but the quality is lacking to the point I think it is still overpriced. The product does not match the image on the box. The BINGO pieces are not spherical, but I suspect they once were supposed to be and were re-designed. Instead, they are shaped more like a ball attached to a cylinder. The cage is clearly designed to pick up and drop only spherical objects, not this other crazy shape. So quite often, the pieces get stuck and don't drop out of the cage or roll down the track like they should. And if you thought it was going to be a metal cage based on the picture, you will be disappointed. The whole thing is plastic. You can still get by with it, but it certainly isn't ideal."
4,Cage Bingo Review,"My eight year old got this for Christmas. It's a great way for the whole family to spend quality time together. Plus, he loves to spin the cage around and be the ""caller"". I would recommend this product."
1,Don't buy this pad,"I had the same problem as another reviewer... the button layout is terrible. I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed it. I tried using the programmable interface with no success. When I went to my games, the buttons were still in thier original layout. This controller is back in the box and sitting on my shelf collecting dust. DON'T BUY THIS CONTROLLER."
1,"Bad, bad product","I will never buy an other Guillemot product. The fact is that the software included with this controler is aweful. It slowed down my powerful system to the point where games are unplayable. Customer support was lacking as well, and I was informed that the problem must lie somewhere in my system software (even though my computer is brand new). The manual contains less than 500 words in English, the buttons are not labled, and the controler was not compatable with contemporary EA titles. Do not buy this product."
1,This could'a been a contender - but it sucks,"The other reviews slamming this product are correct. The associated programming interface is useless and slows the system down to unplayable status. And due to the layout of the buttons, it is next to useless as a geenric controller. The shoulder buttons are set up as 1 & 2 on the left and 3 & 4 on the right. The regular pad buttons on the face of the controller are 5, 6, 7, & 8. Without the ability to use the programming interface to change these, it's too awkward to play just about any game. This is unfortunate as the analog sticks work smoothly and the physical layout & feel of the controller is pretty nice. So much so, that I'm gonna rip it apart and see if I can resolder the connections to put the buttons in their standard places.As it stands though, this controller is frustrating and next to useless."
3,Decent,"The feel and action of this controller are great but the install was a pain in the neck.I have Windows ME and it wouldnt recognize it as being connected,so I went into the little paper that comes with it(there is no detailed Instruction manual) and it stated that if this problem happened ,to uninstall the drivers and go to the Thrustmaster website.I had to download and install a NEW version of the Setup.exe and manually install the driver(which Ive done many times before but never with this much aggrivation).Finally after an hour(it would normally take 3 minutes to install this if they included the proper files)I got the thing installed and it's working fine.I would only reccomend this to those of you who are familiar with computers and able to manually install the drivers.Maybe they'll get a Setup.exe together before too long that will make this truly a ""plug-n-play"" controller."
1,Terrible guide,"Not only were the prices off, but they did not know anything about the toylines. Authors have no idea what year figures were even made. How can they possibly price them?"
3,Wonderful,"I really like it, I usually use Salt Scrubs. Oh, this sugar stuff is much better. If you ever used salt scrubs then you know how they can burn if you have any nicks or cut on your hand, body, etc. Sometimes I'll forget and shave my legs, well then I can't use the scrub. With the sugar scrub you can use it whenever. I like that. The product itself is okay. I would like it if the oils were a little thicker, for lack of a better word. Overall it's okay."
5,Underpriced,"It is incredible to me that I was able to purchase ten discs of probably the single greatest violinist of the century tackling immortal masterpieces for less than the cost of a utility bill.You are thinking, ""where's the catch?"" Well, there is none. The transfers are excellent, the performances, of course, are superb. The only corner-cutting to be found was in the packaging, but even that was more than sufficient.All these riches made me greedy, though. I wish there was Bartok 2 as well as 1, same with Szymanowski. I wish there was Khatchaturian. But how spoiled I am to be complaining! There is so much here to be enjoyed, from the crags of Szymanowski and the peaks of Beethoven to the cool, dark valleys of Chausson. If you only ever buy one violin box set, buy this one."
3,Nice option,This is a nice combination of fitness and aventure wrist computer unit. Yes it is bulk but it has a lot features. look for the S725x as an option if you do not use the compass. If you need a lighter watch for daily use with compass and hr go to suunto x6hr. i hope it helps.
4,DK 110 power supply kit for Canon S-10,"I though the supply kit is a must have for Cannon S10/20 owners. The kit works quite well, except it is a bit pricey. It should be included with the camera. But still is fair not being included with the camera, because i found out that other camera manufacturers dont include adapter kit with their cameras either. Owners just have to get it separately. It save operating cost in the long run. I think it would be great to have an extra rechargeable battery other than the one comes with the DK 119 kit."
4,Canon Power Supply Kit,"This is a must have. This is included with the S10 or S20 when bought outside the US. If you buy the camera in the US, buy this immediately. As with most digital cameras, either Canon eats batteries rapidly.Unit quickly recharges, typically less than 2 hours.It's a bit expensive, but really necessary.Has attachment to have camera directly plugged into wall so you can download pictures to your computer. This is absolutely necessary if you transfer via serial connection."
4,"Necessary, but too expensive","This kit works great, and is absolutely necessary to get the most enjoyment out of your S20 (or S10). Without this kit, the camera will eat batteries and put in the poorhouse.The kit itself is easy to use, and will recharge a battery in just a couple of hours. It seems to work fairly smartly to make sure not to overcharge batteries.The only real downsides are 1, the cost (Canon should have provided this in the camera, IMHO) and 2, you can't recharge a battery and run the camera off of AC at the same time. That said, if you have an S10 or S20, you really need to purchase this kit."
3,Buying S10 w/o DK-110 is like buying a car w/o wheels,"Canon uses a proprietary battery and a/c adapter. When you buy your S10 or S20, don't forget to factor the cost of the DK-110. The higher/newer Canon digital cameras include the a/c and battery kit but these cameras also cost [price]. The bottomline is that you need the DK-110 w/S10 or S20 cameras as the enclosed disposable Li Ion battery lasts about 30 mins. You cannot recharge the battery while using the AC adapter on the camera so I would invest in a DK-110 plus an extra NB-5H battery pack. Paying [price]for the kit is steep but I was fortunate to find the DK-110 kit + battery at a local retailer. There's nothing functionally wrong with the kit but I think it is a steep price. It would have been nice if Canon had designed the camera to take standard AA, hence 3 stars."
3,Canon DK110 Power Supply Kit,I also recently purchased a DK 110 power supply kit for my Canon S-20 camera. The battery shaped portion of the D.C. coupler goes into the camera and not into the power adapter. This can be a little confusing but the instructions that came with the Power Supply Kit does show this clearly. I am writing this because of a previous review from another user regarding this issue. I initially tried to plug it into the adapter instead of the camera!
1,What a pity ... people who believe this have no credibilty,"This is a sci-fi type book trying to pose as a serious topic. It's a total waste of money and time. Only the ignorant of science would be excited about this. There is NO EVIDENCE to support these writings. If evidence were taken seriously this book would be laughed out of town. This is the kind of book for folks who want to BELIEVE, as in a religion, regardless of what the facts and reality are."
2,Not A Balanced View,"This docummentary is not well balanced. It portrays the USA as the ""bad guys"" without mention of the good that the USA did for Vietnam - nor does it mention the cruelty and violence perpetrated by the NVA and the VietCong on the South Vietnamese people. I recommend that you read ""A Better War"" by Lewis Sorley for an account on how close the South Vietnamese and the USA came to winning the war."
1,Totally Disappointed,I am not sure what point this documentary was trying to make. I assume its' intention was to describe the destruction of the Vietnamese villages and innocent people. I do agree with this however I am not aware of any war that only destroyed the warmongers and their habitats. I am a child of the 60's and I disagreed with this war then and I still do now. I supported the soldiers then and I support our soldiers now. I feel as though I wasted my time viewing this montage of a narror perspective of the Vietnam War.
3,31 years later and it still packs a punch,"This is an important documentary about a war that started to involve the US from about 1946 and shouldn't have at all. It was compounded by advisors and leaders into a situation where more and more human resources were thrown at a losing situation. The anti-war sentiment, destruction and official statements are all etched into this film. The historical background is missing here. This film is a graphic snapshot of what it was like at the time. It should not be missed."
5,Very blessed album!!,"It was a big step for Darwin Hobbs to use live instrumental arraingments on this new album, but it worked!! I was so blessed by the ""re-discovery"" of Mr. Hobbs after I had (horrible) written him off as a another studio voice with good production. I was wrong. He has got the goods and they are on display in this new album.There are only a few songs on the album cover, but don't worry, you will be rewarded. The tone and pacing of the album is superb as well as the overall vocals.This album is a must have for any Christian who enjoys being ushered into the presence of God with a spirit of rejoycing!!The cd is still new to me, but I already have a few favorites. Great work Mr. Hobbs!! Keep going higher in the Lord!!"
5,Wow Wow Wow!,People People People. You have to buy this Album immediately. I am officially a Darwin Hobbs fan. I have Darwin's last 2 cd's and I like them alot but this Album sent my heart to a place of worship that I haven't been in a long time. Love it! Love it! Love it!My personal favorite is track #4. Which is a medley of Come let us sing/He is exalted. If I could give it a 10 rating I would.
3,Not as Funky As Earler Works,This recording was more sacred but lacked the fun and modernity of Darwin's earlier works and more R&B fused collaboratons.
3,"Tedious, confusing film to watch","I have just finished watching this film and have a big headache from the noisy shrieking mother's voice towards the end of the film. I found the old english language usage a bit tedious at the beginning of the film. Thankfully, it got much better as it went along.I found the characters a bit confusing in the dialogue, and the humor was lack-luster. I would blame this on the author of the work. The most amusing part of the film was the trip through the woods at night when the brother was leading his mother and cousin around in circles for hours. Otherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone who really enjoys british films. I usually do, but this was certainly a disppointment,and I was glad when it finally finished."
1,She Falls Flat,This on-location performance is dull and unimaginative. The production values are poor and the costumes look to be of Amdram quality. The acting is third rate and the pace of the production crawls. It is bad value for money. It is truly uninspired work.
3,A very Shakespeare like comedy,"I liked the dress and the talk, but thought that the leading man wasn't as convincing in his role asthe leading lady. some of the character roles seemed very badly played to me.The hair styles seemed improbable to just ugly.This play was in the era of both the American and Frenchrevolutions, but seemed to ignore both?I liked the production as an historic play, but thought thatcasting and costumes could have been done better."
5,Country magic,"In the seventies Crystal Gayle (Loretta Lynn's younger sister) was one of the most successful crossover country artists and this valuable collection explains why. It contains her massive 1977 hit Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue plus the next year's number one, Heart Mender.In addition, there are the soulful slow ballads I Still Miss Someone, Talking In Your Sleep and When I Dream, the wistful Someday Soon and another big hit, the catchy Hello I Love You. And if those weren't enough, the melodic beauties Dreaming My Dreams, Too Good To Throw Away and Cry Me A River are superb too.It's a pity the brilliant songs Why Have You Left The One You Left Me For? and Wayward Wind from the album When I Dream have been omitted, but that's my only complaint. This is a wonderful anthology of quality country-pop containing gems aplenty.We Must Believe In Magic / When I Dream"
4,Useful Book!,"This met my expectations quite well. A good overview of the area, followed by a review of the key dive spots in French Polynesia. Excellent phtography, including a good critter guide at the end.The only downside I can find is that there's no real overview of good snorkeling sites . . . they're lumped in with diving sites.Overall, I'd recommend . . . I know it will be useful for my trip!"
3,Trombone stand,"I purchased this trombone stand because of its cheap price, rather than spending $70 for a nice one. I have a Bach large bore trombone with an F attachment and the stand just isn't sturdy enough. It hasn't fallen over on me or anything but it just doesn't feel strong supporting the extra weight of the F attachment. For a small bore / student trombone it works fine. I tried my old trombone on the stand and it does the job well. It really depends on what kind of trombone it will hold.If you spent thousands of dollars on a nice trombone, I would recommend investing another $50 for a top-of-the-line stand to protect your instrument."
4,serves the purpose,This stand holds my husband's trombone comfortably and it is easy to get it on and off the stand. It is easy to set up and put away and serves the purpose well.
4,Bone stand alone!,On-Stage Stands Trombone Stand. This a great durable stand for a Trombone. It was easy to assemble and fits the trombone perfectly. The trombone stand has some metal and plastic part. One must take care as not to over tighten the screws.
3,Concern vs.naivete,"Having read this book in one day, I can attest that it is well written, interesting and informative. It is difficult to believe some of the items revealed to be factual. Yes, Tammy was on way too many medications and yes, her husband was totally aware of the addiction. What I can't believe is that Jackie was so ignorant of her mother's popularity. She was raised in and around Nashville and did not realize how popular and loved Tammy was? This statement struck me as unreal. If Jackie truly believed that her mother needed intervention, was being abused and taken advantage of by Richie, why didn't she scream...loud and long to anyone, tabloids or otherwise who would listen? She claims Tammy valued privacy, most drug addicts and abused women prefer not to go public. A well-written book but some of the sentiments expressed under the guise of a ""loving daughter"" just don't add up."
1,TOM CARTER HAS SHOWN HIS TRUE COLORS,"Well I have come to the conclusion Tom Carter must have financial problems. Why else would he have taken on such a smuty book? I used to be a fan of his. I will never buy another Tom Carter book. Country Fans, stand by Tammy and boycot this piece of trash."
1,don't waste your money,"well I am saddened that Tammy's daughter would choose to say such horrible things about her own mother. Why did'nt she make this accusations when her mother was still alive? I will tell you why, because her mother would have disowned her. She knows these things are lies and she is hiding behind the truth. Because the truth would'nt sell, would it Jackie? You should be embaressed by what you have done to your Mother's legacy. I'd love to hear George Richey's side of this story. It seems to me that he was the one that was really there for her not you Jackie. Go get a life."
1,Even a NewYorker can smell a rat!,"Come on guys give us a break. You mean to tell us that this girl just noticed her mom had a problem. You must think we are stupid Tom. What a chump. All kids end up writing tell alls about their mommies. I bet money this girl never had a job in her life. She is sitting up counting her money right now. Tell us something we don't know. That last husband of hers kidnapped her? Yeah, and I'm the tooth fairy. I guess that's why Tammy stood by him for 20 years. Out of fear. You have to come up with a better on than that girl. What a fool. Sorry Tammy your girl is a rat."
1,Don't be stupid,"""This video turns even the biggest klutz into a master of VC Technology"" - Even a child could see the flaw in this concept. Get Real."
1,to lg bathing suit,I used this company's sizing chart to calculate my suit size. I sent for the suit. When I got the suit I found it was about 2 sizes to large. Unfortunatly I was away for 16 days when the suit arrived so I was not able to return it.
5,Excellent,"Very out-of-the-box performance for Wynonna, well done and very impressive. Wynonna is so personable and spiritual, I just love her talent and perspective."
5,Great read!,"I've read all the books in Stashower's Houdini series, and this is the best!The Houdini character is well-defined -- a showman and egotist, but lovable -- as he tries to play Sherlock Holmes, but inevitably finds himself lacking. Only his persistence and belief in himself pulls himself through. His brother also manages to keep things on track, chronicling the events, much as Watson did for Holmes.The action is fast paced, the characters rich in detail. Thoroughly enjoyable.The mystery is intriguing and the final revelation is doubly amazing when it is revealed that 19th century technology was advanced enough to actually make the solution plausible (I won't spoil the ending).Get this book! You won't be disappointed!"

Lots of cool action after Vegito (the fusion of Vegeta and Goku) gets absorbed into Majin Buu's body. For some reason, Vegito reverts back to Goku and Vegeta when they're inside Buu. Once fierce rivals, they work together to overcome the inner workings of Buu's body to rescue Piccolo, Trunks, Gohan, and Goten, who are trapped inside.I enjoyed this video because of its creativity and action - how often do our heroes fight within someone's body instead of fighting another person? The interaction and bickering between the two Saiyans cracked me up, as well as them trying to overcome Buu's bodily functions. As always, the DBZ video leaves you with a cliffhanging ending - you have to wait again until the next videos are on sale."
2,i agree,"for some reason, my dvd messes up and says that it is unable to read the disc. it stops at the second episode, which is one of the best out there. i dont know what is up but if someone could tell me what happened that would be great. also, it cant even do the japaneese version which is mostly why a bought it."
2,Hose quality poor,"The hose split in two areas, one near the base and the other was near the top of the spring they use to keep the hose from bending over on itself. The wall thickness of the hose is inadequate and bends restricting the flow of steam. I sent the hose back to them at the beginning of July and yet to receive my replacement. I will NEVER purchase a Rowenta product ever again. Poor service. Save your money and aggravation. I'm looking into Jiffy steamers now. Goodbye Rowenta."
4,Good product,This is a good product and i'd recommmend it.. but on difficult items nothing beats the dry-cleaner or the good old fashioned method of an iron and board. It definitely is great for the morning before you leave for work and gets most wrinkles out.
2,A Bit Disappointed,"Alright, let me first say that I was very excited to get a steamer for my clothes. Second, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of instructions on ""how to"" press or steam my clothes so that the machine actually worked as desired. The machine is sturdy, well constructed, and the steam pours out of the unit. In fact, from a functional standpoint, it is as good as marketed. Unfortunately, I cannot figure out how to properly and ""easily"" steam my clothes and there were no directions in the unit to help me learn the craft. So, I will keep trying but, until I get better, my sturdy iron seems to do a better job."
3,to hot to handle,"wish it would get winkles out a little better also steamer head gets really hot must wear glove,[t should have a water drainer on the body ,but it does work better than the last brand i tried."
4,Garment Steamer,"I purchased the Rowenta IS8200 Commercial Garment Steamer a few weeks ago and have used it on drapes, curtains, and dresses. The steamer works fine, but it takes a while to get wrinkles out. The hose comes off at times and I had to stick it back in. The steamer is fine for curtains and drapes. For ironing dresses I still use the iron, because it is more fast."
1,if there is less than 1 star i will give it !!??,"hi,i only bought this book because it was required for my course, and i am planning to sell after the course, if you need to learn advanced java; this is not your book, if you want to view some complex examples, you may review it, not for teaching definitely"
1,for people who don't know how to program,"If you need this book to learn jsp, servlets, jdbc, etc. you should look for a new profession. All topics covered in this book are available for free at java.sun.com. Unlike this book, Sun provides concise, clear examples and explanations. Only people who don't know how to program read Deitel books."
1,terrible,"A book on Java by people that don't understand java. Sure, anyone can write java programs, but to demonstrate the capabilities of this language is another matter. Once you understand how to program, learning a new technology (e.g.RMI) isn't difficult. Additionally, all the technologies covered in this book have free tutorials available on the web, which in many cases are similar to the examples given in the book. The problem is this book doesn't teach good program design."
2,Mea Culpa,"I am partly through the book. Some of the prose describing all of the code is tedious but there is much to learn. The examples at the ends of the chapters ae quite challenging and here is my complaint. The book is not advertised correctly. it is imposible to get the ansers to the examples (on CD) unless you are a recognized instructor with a certifcate. I know because I called Pearson Education support. This is quite a lot of money to pay to NOT obtain the answers, but that would be ok if if were plainly advertised before I made the purchase."
3,"OK Book, Could Stand Improvement","I picked up this book as I have recently started working in my first Web Development job. We're a J2EE shop, and I needed a reference to pick up the J2EE APIs that we didn't cover in school (ie..EJBs, RMI, etc...). The book offers a lot of information, but you can get a lost in the coding examples. For example, in learning RMI, I found myself getting somewhat lost because I didn't have a background in Swing, which the book employs throughout much of the examples in the book.My suggestion to the publishers is to stay focused on the basics of the technology (ie RMI) so you can see clearly how to set up a program for RMI. Then, maybe employ the Swing (and whatever other APIs) as a 2nd or 3rd coding example.It's not a bad book, but I found the Java 2 Enterprise Edition Bible (Couch) easier to understand."
1,Waste of money,"This book was a text book for one of my advanced java classes. Unfortunately, there is very little to learn from this book. Filling the book up with pages of examples without sufficient explaination of concepts makes this book a complete waste of money. Most of the chapters were rushed, students will have a tough time grasping important concepts unless they buy some good books as well (OReilly, Addison-Wesley). I will not recommend it to anybody."
2,Who needs books,"Use the internet. As a potential programmer, you should get used to using the net to find out how to handle programming tasks. That is where 100% of your information will come from once you get out of college. That being said, the only reason you would probably buy this would be for college and this book should be out-dated by now."
5,EXQUISITE Fine-Art at a Bargan Price...,".This new two CD set is a real treasure: exquisite fine-art at a bargan price. The content and execution of this Art is virtually unsurpassable.The splendid Wallin/Pöntinen Duo have produced other fine recordings of GoldmarkGoldmark: Complete Works For Violin & Piano, Vol.1Karl Goldmark: Complete Works for Violin & Piano, Vol. 2, HindemithPaul Hindemith: The Complete Violin SonatasRegerReger: Complete Works for Violin, Saint-SansSaint-Sans: Sonata for Violin & Piano; Triptyque; Elégie, and SchoenbergSchoenberg: Complete Works for Violin & Piano, among others.Swede Roland Pöntinen is an extremely talented and sensitive pianist who is amassing an excellent collection of solo recordings: SatieE.

2,Somewhat disappointing,The beginning of the book was interesting but it went downhill from there. The story of the why the Latvians had emmigrated and their determined efforts to keep their culture alive kept me reading. The attitude of Latvians who remained in Latvia toward those who had emmigrated was unexpected.The love affair of the obnoxious Clara went on ad infinitum and then suddenly they married and went to Paris for their honeymoon. It felt as if the author didn't know how to tie everything up in an interesting way; she just quit.
4,not really use it yet,"very heavy arrow. great for long bow. good quality, but didn't use us it yet, it shipped as a bunch of pipe. you have to cut it first, and stick feather, head and tails. so I just bought some other arrows instead. Maybe this product is great for a professional, but not me."
2,Falco Falters,"This is a fine series so when I began this volume I had hopes that it would be of the same standard as the others. Ms. Haney has a genuine gift in giving readers the ""texture"" of everyday life in imperial Rome (at the time of Vespasian and Titus in this one). The dialogue and the characters are both engaging. So what went wrong? A young girl appears to speak with Falco believing someone in her family wants to kill her. And away we go, on and on and on! I was weary by the time I got to the rather flat conclusion and felt that a good editing would have been most helpful; the length of this book (326 pages) really cannot support so thin a story. I was left wondering what had happened and if somehow I had missed something as there was so little going on."
2,Used Book Was From Another Library,"I ordered ths book to replace one I lost from my local library. My library was OK with a used book, but when it arrived it was marked as having come from the New York Public Library and my local library would not accept it. A second book which I ordered as being ""new hardcover"" arrived as a new paperback, which my Library also would not accept. I finally had to pay the library for the cost of a replacement. Not a satisfactory experience."
4,best of both worlds,One Virgin Too Many offers a great combination of historical fiction with a modern voice that makes it more palatable and less pretentious.
2,This product is not that satisfactory!,"After reviewing this Item, I thought it is of good quality. But the badminton racquets are not that good quality as we expected and most important thing is we realized that there was an item missing when we try to setup the net. Amazon needs to take care while shipping any items and customer service is also not that satisfactory. When I called them for sending the missing part, they said I need to buy on my own and they will refund it....where should I go for it??? I have ordered this online bacause I don't have any shop closeby...Amazon needs to improve their quality of service...."
1,Breaks easily,Only a few minutes out of the box the strings on a racket broke during routine play. This is a poorly designed product.
4,Nice net,"Very happy with the net. We already knew the racquets would be junk, but we looooove the net and basically bought it for the net!"
3,"It's a great net, but the instructions were not helpful","Overall, this net is very high quality and I have boughten a new one every summer so I have plenty of NICE rackets, so the crappy rackets in this don't bother me but if you are buying it I would suggest get better rackets and birdies. This net is fairly easy to set up the INSTRUCTIONS ARE USELESS but if you have experience with putting up nets then you will figure it out I kinda bent the rules and set it up my own way since it was so complicated. I still have the anchors but I had to ductape the ropes on the top of the pole.Also, this is not a in ground net, so it shifts quite often. so if it is windy it will blow right over and be the biggest pain in the a** to put back up I put two sandbags (one at each pole) to keep it sturdy and it hasn't fallen over yet.This is a great net, no doubt about it! Just if you have no experience with setting up badminton net's this might be hard to set up!But I would highly reccomend this net otherwise."
1,piece of junk,"bought this as a birthday present, son and i used it for 5 minutes and 2 of the rackets strings already broke...net fine, set up easy... 10 minutes more all 4 rackets strings broke, what a piece of junk, next time i'll spend more on birthday present.. do not buy 54.00 to much for junk brad"
5,This Is The Guy,"I'd almost given up on Country music over the past five years. It seems like all I hear is tired old retreads being trotted out as ""the latest thing,"" but still a few artists like Brian McComas allow me to hold out hope. Back Up Again is the follow up to his terrific debut CD, and though it was a long wait, it was worth it. McComas is genuine. He has energy and feeling. I can't say that every single song is great, but I've never heard a CD (including greatest hits CDs) of any genre in which every single song is great, but there is a lot of good material here. This CD goes hand in hand with the debut without attempting to copy it. This is the guy, and I think he will be for many years to come."
5,Excellent Shipping,Great product with excellent shipping. Very easy to use and the product was as advertised.
3,Works good but poor quality.,"If you want a nice backup BP monitor then this unit is for you, I would not recommend it as a primary BP unit for anyone with High Blood pressure, but it is very low in priced and is pretty accurate unit that just lack durability.BTW I personaly do not trust Digital units because you really have no idea if they are reading correctly, while with the Analog units you have your own ears to verify the reading.The quality of construction with this unit is very poor, but it will do the Job and should last at least 1 year if you use it lightly and thats about all you can ask for at this price"
4,"Great BP cuff for the price, but...","Great BP cuff, and very easy to use. The price is definitely right, especially if you get free shipping. However, if your upper arm is thinner than most people's, then the cuff will not fit (the ""male"" Velcro will actually wrap around and miss the ""female"" Velcro on a thin arm -- I am 6' 1"" and 147 pounds, and it just barely attaches to my arm). Other than that, I would recommend this unit highly."
2,Unreliable for serious use,"The rubber inflatable part of this device popped like a balloon at normal inflation pressure when I was checking blood pressure on my patient during a house call, rendering it useless ever after. This device works well for taking one's own blood pressure at home but should not be relied upon for serious medical use."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered 3 copies of this book/journal for friends who are actively involved in the AKA Sorority. However, I did expect that the journal might inlude some historical entries, but it is just a cover with blank pages... I am still using them as gifts... but I truly expected more than just blank sheets of paper!?!"
5,DESTINED FOR THE TOP....,Clay Potter is definitely...destined for the top! My rating is really not 5 stars - it is 5 + 5! Can't wait for the next CD...
5,"A New,Powerful Heartbeat of Country Music!","Mr. Potter's style & delivery are absolutely marvelous! This is truly an exceptional piece of work and one can feel the music come alive while listening! ""New Man Now"" is sure to touch that 'special' place that all parents have experienced. ""Just Say No"" is a light, fun rendition of everyone's inability to say NO to that 1st-time-puppy-love-torcher relationship we've all experienced @ some point! Lets be honest, gentlemen, who among us has never tried living ""Double Love""? The song-writing can be appreciated by all who love real, heartfelt writing, and is clever & brilliant in it's delivery. This is truly a masterpiece with powerful synergy. Can't wait for more!"
4,works pretty well,"my first straightener really...works on my asian hair...i like the fact that you can choose the temperature setting, in increments of 25 degrees...only problem i have is that when you don't grab enough hair it feels like it snags ur hair because of the way the plates are located in the center, unlike some other straighteners where the plats run over the edges/side so its one complete smooth surface..."
2,far too simple.....,"The analysis and descriptions contained in the deck of 64 cards are far too simple. Just one ""artificially written"" example for each point illustrated is insufficient. And due to the binding, the deck of cards is so difficult and inconvenient to be read. This copy may be enough to satisfy readers who just wants an introduction of the topic, but never those who want to deep understanding for practical use."
5,great gift !,I received this items as a gift and I love it. It is 6 separate dumbbells that I actually have a place to store them rather than leave them all over the house and it comes with a DVD. The DVD is great and i made me realize there is more exercise that you can do with a dumbbell rather than the basic curl. I love this !
3,RegulaR,I bought this watch and it came with problems for the battery. I change the battery & a week later stops again! Cause I live y Caracas can't change back this watch!
5,Great game,I LOVE this game!!! The only problem (and it's not really that bad) is that I cannot figure out how to save a game in progress. The graphics and wonderful and the game is easy to play once one gets used to the controls. I play at least one game a day and enjoy every minute!
2,it's NOT in the game,"The successor to Triple Play Baseball, despite having some nice graphics and other fancy shenanigans, is, in the end, a disappointment performance-wise. Most glaring is that despite this user running the game on a Windows XP machine with ample memory, the program SLOWS DOWN much too frequently, particularly in situations with runners on base. Additionally, routine plays easily made in previous versions (such as the double play) are inexplicably more difficult to perform this time around. And the decision to have different buttons control which base a fielder throws (rather than have just one ""throw"" button) -- why???Bottom line: very frustrating to play. Despite all the improvements made, some very obvious shortcomings significantly hinder the enjoyment of the game."
5,Great for a 2003 game!,This game is so much fun to play and it was and you can get a good deal because its old!
4,Very Impressive... but with a few problems,"I love MVP Baseball 2003. I am not a very skilled player when it comes to computer games, so I am not put off by the lack of you having to aim your bat as well as get the timing right. Stealing bases is pretty hard, and sometimes I feel the spectacular catches are a little too common. In addition, I wish the game had the bullpen warmup system and it would also be cool if the pstchological side of baseball ( anger at getting hit by pitch, frustration on a missed play, would show, but maybe that'll be in MVP Baseball 2004.Overall, the game was great."
2,"If they are going to manipulate us, the least they could do is make it entertaining","You remember that scene in the preview where they throw that little remote airplane in the air to surveil enemy territory? That was awesome. Or how about the moment where a Seal catches a guy shot in the head so he doesn't make a splashing sound? Those scenes made me want to see this movie regardless of the fact that I knew it was going to be barefaced cheerleading for American foreign policy. While there were a few other cool moments in which you felt like you were playing a video game, and some of the gear and tactics were interesting to observe, they really didn't put enough effort into this. Without enough special effects to make up for it, I was nauseated by the glorification of the wholesome, family-oriented American special ops guys, and the unsophisticated characterization of the shifty-eyed terrorists from hell. You may as well re-watch True Lies instead of wasting your time on this."
2,A Real Review,"This movie is pretty bad, slapped together generic story and complete lack of acting ability across the board. How does that make a 5 star movie? That's easy, take advantage of peoples patriotism and the idea that disliking a moving that is ""celebrating our men in uniform"" is not an option unless you are a communist.If you really like listening to semi real sounding military jargon delivered via terrible acting, this movie is for you. If you can ignore all the normal requirements of a ""good"" movie and simply focus on military dudes shooting at stuff sometimes, this movie is for you. If you are looking for an entertaining, well crafted, thought inspiring film, skip this one."
1,Rather poorly conceived nonsense,"I purchased this movie without knowing to much about it. As I am not an American, I am not so carried away or influenced by the rather patriotic reviews or jingoism that this movie has received. To review a movie as an art form it must have something going for it to make it have the necessary qualities that make a good movie. It must be well crafted, well structured and well acted that tells a plausible story. To engage military personel such as US Navy Seals, and ask them to act out a some what inplausible story line is simply a badly made James Bond movie and is simply risible. The producers would have been better served if they engaged the documentary format. This movie is contrived nonsense and I am sure that the Seals deserve better. I much regret purchasing the movie."
1,Bad; No Offense -,"Apparently you can't review anything here without being disrespected or getting hate-mail, which makes this even more ironic. I understand some people can be very patriotic, but if you can't show any respect for what people think about a ""movie"", well...I have a lot of respect and admiration for the SEALS and every other member or our Military/Armed Forces. However, this movie goes overboard in many things (plot, ""acting"", etc) to the point where I think it should be advertised as something other than a movie."
1,Overall unimpressive,You really need to look past bad acting and a poor script with little to no plot on this one. I'd recommend getting another movie instead.
1,Lame Acting,This movie was exactly like it thought it was going to be bad acting and more bad acting. There was one real actor and that was Lisa Morales (Played by Roselyn Sanchez). A waste of a $1.50 at Redbox.
4,Acting give way!!!,"The acting was a little off, but going in knowing that theyre real SEALS, I expected a little lack in skill. Its glld enough to portray how they really feel about their families, honor, and duties, and is enough to get the audience from action sequence to the next. Overall, kudos and cheers! I'll be purchasing the blu ray. Ive heard its basically a recruiting video, but I love war films and documentaries and this fits in that shelf in my home! THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM FOR ALL YOU DO! ALWAYS support our troops no matter how you feel about our politicians!"
2,Not that great,"We didn't really like this movie, at first we were enthusiastic, but at the end we found this movie pretty much boring and without interest."
3,The action is good!,"Don't see this movie for the acting, because it is horrible. The action scenes and tactics were great. This is a must see for any veteran. A good time with this one."
4,Worth it,"Great story, great action, not the best acting, but it gives you a great appreciation for what sacrifices we ask of our military. God bless the US armed forces and thank you."
5,Excellent Movie!!,Shows just how much sacrifice our soldiers make and how much we need them!!You won't go wrong with this one..
4,Act of Valor,I had wanted to watch this movie when I heard the Seals actually were in the movie as my daughter-in-laws brother is a Seal and trains the Seals. I was quite suprised at what they actually do and I cried at the end of the movie.
5,Well Done,Exceeded our expectations. Very gripping and makes you feel patriotic. The fact that this was done by regular people (not actors) I think really makes an impact.
5,Act of Valor-Blu-Ray,"Very well done. Gives an inside view of a seal's life at home an on a mission. Plus, according to the movie writeup, the missions depicted were based on actual seal operations. I am a Vietnam Veteran, and the only contact with Seals I had was in jump school. This was the last part of their training and they were in such fantastic physical condition that they partied at the club all night and joined us for training in the morning! Very tough dudes!"
5,"""Act Of Valor"" Bluray","I was immediately drawn to watch this movie for several reasons. I'm an ex-Navy Corpsman, have read several books about the Seals and some authored by Seals.This film captures in part the hard work that it takes to achieve their elite team membership, their sacrifices to keep our country free, and their intelligence as well as there craftmanship to do their tasks. The characters were convincing without stardom and that for me was a real breath of fresh-air.Only a few films bring the intensity to the screen like ""Act Of Valor."" ""Saving Private Ryan"" was of course on a grander scale (WWII) and ""We Were Soldiers"" (Vietnam War).I congratulate all the participants for this great film and highly recommend this be included in your film library!"
5,"'You live your life by a code, an ethos.'","""Act of Valor"" is a great military movie starring actors and real-life Navy SEALS. Because of this some of the acting is a little wooden but to me, this did not detract too much from the movie. I knew before I started watching that there were non-actors in the film and I was more interested in the story itself, based on real-life happenings that the SEALS participated in.It showed the camaraderie that military personnel form between each other, as they depend on each other, risking their lives together. It also shows the heartbreak of war and that the families waiting at home sacrifice just like our soldiers do.I thought the movie felt very realistic. Be aware this is a military action film. There is violence, scenes of torture, some language.This probably isn't my favorite military action film. That isSaving Private Ryan[Blu-ray] but it ranks right towards the top."
5,act of valor,Very real to life experience. Kept me interested from the opening scenes. This film put me right next to characters in every scene. excellent directing! I want to see this film again!
4,They do for us so we can do.,"The Navy Seals are highly trained and put themselves in harms way taking care of problems so we can live in freedom without fear. Critics seem to think the movie is a recruiting film, and perhaps it is. However, those critics wake up every morning with the ability to critique because the Navy Seals have made our country safer. Could the acting be better? Perhaps, but most people don't know what the Navy Seals do or what they encounter in their lives. This movie does a good job of depicting their mission and lives."
3,Bleh. So so...,"Dude. You don't shoot a scene where the SEALS unload a boat mounted mini gun on a truck full of scumbags with ak-47s, only to go out of your way to film the baddies disembarking to safety only feet away... hiding in bushes. They'd be dead or half of them would. The boat infiltration with the guy in the suit was interesting. The sniper shots on the camp in the jungle was good, too. A little too chummy with the ""navy seal bros"" scenes on the beach. Three stars because I'm an American, darn it."
4,"Excellent Photography, Realistic scenes.","Having a relative who worked with Special Forces, we found this very interesting. It is well done, but, ironically, one of the things that makes it interesting causes its one weakness. Actual Special Forces soldiers are used to play the parts of the SF people in the movie. They do an amazingly good job of acting, considering that, and they certainly leave nothing to be desired in the many action scenes, but this is the first movie I have ever seen where the bad guys did a better job of acting than the good guys. :) That said, the equipment used is the real stuff, and the shooting is done realistically, and the acts of bravery and heroism are not only believable, but true to what we know from our contacts. The plot is great, and moves right along, and the filming is fantastic. This is worth seeing just because it is real, and shows both the good and the bad guys for what they are."
5,ACCURACY/AUTHENTIC,"A riveting story about a group of heroic SEALS that go to rescue a kidnapped CIA operative. There's plenty of action with 'head' shots, quick-moving operations and a ton of reasons to be proud of our elite fighters. It was particularly noteworthy that there were active duty SEALS in the movie, and obviously many of the sequences were real and authentic. A good action flick."
5,Watched it with intensity,"A great review of our military prowess. I also like the convenience of Amazon, Cyber City is the way to go"
5,Amazing movie,This movie is thrilling and suspenseful and full of action. Anyone with ties to the military would thoroughly enjoy it.
1,not shure why everyone likes this,dull and boring and the acting is horrid i really did not enjoy this one to be honest not one bit
5,Great Movie,"This is a great movie with wonderful action scenes. The fact that the actual soldiers are actors makes it even better. There are things in this movie that you won't see anywhere else, simply because of the realism that the actual soldiers bring to the scenes.This is a must see for anyone looking for a action/war/soldier movie. You won't be disappointed.Makes me feel good about our armed forces!"
4,A Reality Check,This film likely provides a modest view into the lives and deeds of of some of our nation's bravest warriors. There is plenty of action for the high testosterone bunch. The well executed raid that claimed Osama Ben Laden demonstrated their abilities and prowess. 6.18.2012.
5,Good Guys Kill Bad Guys,What a refreshing movie depicting the war on terror. Most hollywood movies are so politically correct that they become unwatchable dishonest stinking waste.
4,act of valor,Great movie. Effects are great. Makes you see what seals can do! A must see film. Even the wife enjoyed it.
4,Realistic,It was definitely dramatic when you know the content is accurate portrayal of our brave soldiers. The sacrifice both the service member and their families make is profound but with all sincerity appreciate their service beyond words.
4,fairly accurate,"Good show,, the weapons were awesome as were the seals...acting not so much...worth the money though. I would say rent it!"
5,Awesome,"I am proud to be a daughter of a 20 year vet who lived his life so that the people of this country could live theirs freely. Freedom is not free, my dad and my family had to pay the price. Hoorah!"
3,Good movie!!,"I took my husband to see this and he really liked it, it stayed pretty true to real life, but because they got real people playing the roles and not actors the acting seems a little off, but what do you expect these people are great at protecting our country not crying on cue!"
5,Great Movie,"I saw this in theaters and is is an amazing movie!! Someone said this is not a recruiting movie, well, they were wrong. I do not know if they only had it for the theatrical release, but at the end they tried telling you that you should join the military. Overall, I love the realism, it truly does inspire and get you pumped!"
5,Really Liked It,"Not sure what we expected, but we really liked this movie. We had not heard of it before, but were very glad we took the chance and rented it."
5,My kinda movie,"If you love this great country as I do then, this movie is a must see. We don't take crap off nobody (""don't tread on me"") is the theme of this action packed high-tech weaponry bad ass movie. Loved it."
2,"Folks, please review the movie and not the content...","1. It's amazing how people just let their emotions guide their movie reviews. I understand that folks like a nice patriotic movie (or at least most folks); I'm in that crowd. On the other hand, let's deal with reality here and specifically review the actual movie and not the content of the movie.2. Bottomline, this film's main downfall is the lame - stiff - unnatural acting. The cinematography is good, the writing is fairly good, the storyline is good enough for me (I'm a fairly easy guy to please), but the acting is just terrible. I mean, as you're watching this film, you're just completely conscious that these guys are trying to act natural, but that they're just not pulling it off. With the above being said, with anyone with a military interest or background, it's a no brainer to watch the film just to see what the hype is about, but a one time view is going to suffice for most."
1,A tribute movie,"People please. This is a tribute movie paying tribute to the very special men who protect our freedom. It is not a good movie, there is no plot. I think it was mainly made to highlight the names of men who have died for us. But the movie and the acting are not very good. It is a bit like a video game."
5,Wow.....,"This movie is amazing! I absolutely loved it! It made me cry. I'm SO GLAD they made one honoring heroes in this country. With Obama cutting military spending and the country going down the drain, it gives me hope that there are selfless heroes willing to fight for this country. This makes me proud to be an American; unlike the President and those who support him. How cool is it that there are still people who are willing to do this kind of thing? Selfless sacrifice......very hard to find in this society of entitlement. If I could give it six stars, I would!!"
1,horrible acting,"The story line was reasonable, but the acting was so terrible, it was hard to take the movie seriously.Maybe they were real life veterans, and not actors, which makes the idea of this movie legit, but they tried to act, and it was revolting."
1,PR for Pentagon,"Besides stiff acting and a weak script, the glorification of American hegemnony is disgusting. A film that promotes the idea that every shore and valley is for the U.S. to treat as their own."
1,Wow some of the worst acting ever....boring,Where did they find these actors. What are people thinking to like this. This would have been better as a documentary so at least you could listen to Morgan Freeman's voice and expect bad acting. Give us another black hawk down.You have a better chance of committing suicide then to die in combat if your a soldier in the war on terror. That's a realistic war movie.
5,THIS MOVIE IS BADASS!!!!!!!!,I saw this movie in theaters and it was realy cool. The action was incredible and its a must get MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!
5,every American must see this movie,deepest appreciation to those who sacrificed themselves for the safety of this country! this movie is powerful and potent in moving your spirit telling you just like it is in real life. No fancy movie stars but they are the stars of our lives. Proud to be an American!
5,Worth more than every dollar,"Act Of Valor (DVD+Blu-ray+Digital Combo) (Blu-ray)Everybody, buy this film!! OK. It doesn't, but even if it sucked these SEALS deserve every dollar and more. So, BUY THIS FILM!!That said, if you enjoy action films, you'll enjoy this one. These are not actors. These are not stunt men. What you see is the real thing. It's staged, but realistically staged. In some scenes there is live fire. These SEALS would not allow any B.S.Guts? These men define the word. I'm speaking about what these men do in the world.So, honor them. Buy and watch this film. It is money well spent.In case you're wondering, I'm not a SEAL. I served in the NAVY. That's all. Believe me, I'm not a wannabe. In my life, I have twice had the honor of knowing a SEAL. And, I do mean HONOR.What are you waiting for? BUY THIS FILM!!"
5,Outstanding portrail,"Having worked in the special ops environment for 24 years, I have a deep respect for the operators. I get their outlook on live and the drive to get the mission done. To me the acting was more genuine than the ""professional"" Hollywood actors. Most are just not convincing that they have physical skills. I find that I am not watching many of the recent movies. I realize they are not making documentaries, that they hope to entertain for profit. I find it unconvincing."
5,"Must see this in the theatre, must own DVD","This movie left me completely impressed, proud, humbled at the skill and heart of these warriors. Just awesome capabilities in each man, and incredible equipment their given to carry out their missions with. My lone ""complaint"": I wish the names of SEALS scrolling in the credits was slower. Besides ""See this now"" my other admonition is ""Stand and honor them"" when you see the list."
5,This is the Real Deal,"I saw this movie in a free screening prior to release. It is much more than a movie--it is about as real to life as any SEAL movie ever produced. This movie is most impressive because of its realistic action. Secondly, it is impressive because it is a non-typical Hollywood product, i.e. not inherently anti-American or politically correct in storyline or undertones. Although some may remark that the acting is weak, in actuality the fact that the cast members are not professional actors makes it more real even if it is not as polished. The plot is fine although somewhat formulaic. The bottom line is that this movie is special because it is about as real as it gets. Forget Charlie Sheen's movie, ""GI Jane,"" or Marcinko's books--this movie is the real deal."
3,Eh?,Good portrayal of the honor of our soldiers but I probably could have skipped this one. I really like the part at the end where the bad guy....JK
5,Eye opening,Are these guys actors????Well done . a very strong insite as to be an Elite Soldier. Will definately recommend..
4,Awesome movie,"One of the best movies ever, I bought it for my husband, he loved it :). It arrived on time unharmed. I preordered it and it arrived when it was supposed to."
4,Very good movie.,"Very good except you can imagine from the beginning what characters are likely not going to make it. If you like these movies and you are a patriotic American you will enjoy this and if you don't already, you'll probably be more willing to thank a service member or Veteran on the street."
4,Great movie!,"Great action flick, my teenage son even liked it!I don't want to give away the ending, but the good guys win!"
3,Lacking In Imagination & Execution,"Seems to have been a replay of several cinematic efforts offered up in the past. A lot of caps busted, very few magazines recharged & a closing Hi-Speed chase lacking in reality! Glad I didn't spring for two $8 tickets at the cinema!"
3,"Worth a Rental, but not Great","Can you get past the terrible acting? Let's let the soldiers do their jobs and the actors to theirs!Much like a George Lucas film I did get by the terrible acting, and it was an exciting movie as far as old fashioned special effects goes, but this isn't going to make my top ten war movies anytime soon. Probably the best recruiter/propaganda film I've seen. If you don't have the attention span to watch documentaries, then this is for you. I could spend a weekend watching the History Channel and learn about Navy Seals than I did from this movie.I will say that I came away with a better understanding of how these missions are carried out logistically, though you don't get a good sense of the time put into preparations for these missions. Do they really surf all day and then go on a mission, or can we get a time stamp (a la Law & Order) to understand that they probably have a lot of field training as well as classroom time."
4,Stacked with skirmishes,"""Act of Valor"" is an action film which follows the missions and camaraderie of U.S. Navy SEALs and U.S. Navy Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen.The narrative of the movie is typical of many works of the same genre and this is perhaps its weakest attribute.However, for viewers who enjoy blazing action this film delivers plenty of big bangs and hails of gunfire.Overall this is a movie where an action enthusiast should feel right at home and be satisfied with many barrages of bullets.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
2,Dull,Nothing very interesting to watch. I would suggest watching many other titles first.Seems like it could have been over at the 40 minute mark.
4,Realist Action All the Way,I am retired military and can tell you the action scenes in this flick are VERY realistic. The acting/dialogue on the emotional bits can be a little tight but this movie is about the fight. If you want to know what our special forces guys do - this movie gives you a peak into their world.
3,"Good action, but the worst acting you will ever see. EVER","The most wooden acting I have ever seen. I thought something was weird while watching it, then I remembered these are real Navy Seals. Stick to your day job boys, you're much better at it"
2,"Mildly Interesting, not a big hit!","This one you should see as a rental. Not purchase material and not an ""A"" list choice but still interesting and fairly well made too. Check out ""Fortress"" if you like this movie. (It's about a bomber crew during the war) It's a much better movie."
2,Expected Far Better !,"Act of Valor is a poorly scripted, ridiculously executed Hollywood film makes it all seem forgettable and unimportant.The real SEALs deserve better than that.Movie was streamed from Amazon and was terrible, constant stop and starts and over all poor quality of the picture"
1,garbage,Worst movie i have seen in a long time.They should give me my money back. the acting was deplorable. and the story line had to be writen by the american propaganda machine.
1,Boring,"I actually fell asleep in this movie...it was that bad! I'm sure the Modern Warfare douchebags will enjoy it..but not I...watch something better like ""This Means War""."
3,"Decent Action, Below Average Acting","The acting in the movie wasn't terribly great--but that was balanced out by the fact that real-life, active duty U.S. Navy Seals & other Navy members played a significant part in the movie. There were some decent action shots in the flick. Certainly not worth the buy, maaaaybe worth the rent, worth watching if you catch it (for free) on TV."
5,Act of Valor,The price of this movie was just right...The quality of the DVD was great. Act of Valor was definitely a hit in my home.
4,Pleasant Surprise!,"I am going to be totally honest here when I say I only saw this movie because I half expected it to be like Discovery channel's Surviving the Cut, which I loved. This movie was not that, but it was still pretty cool. It featured real Navy SEALs giving a commendable (pun intended) acting performance and had some really great action sequences. The story is your run-of-the-mill terrorist action plot, with America's elite tasked to take them down before they reach the homeland. It ends exactly how you think it will, but that's okay because it's still a really fun film."
3,meh,shoot em up kill them all dead movie. It was ok. seems hollywood is just pumping out a bunch of mediocrity lately.watch Full Metal Jacket if you want to see a good war movie.
3,military knowledge required,"The action I believe was very realistic, but the movie was made for someone who knows and understands the military and all the acronyms - my husband enjoyed it, but I was confused during many of the transitions and felt that what was being done was never explained."
2,Act of Valor,"Moving story. Great concept using actual nave seals. Utter failure in execution. The acting was horrendous. In hindsight use the real guys for the documentaries, lead the acting to the trained professionals."
3,Expected more,"Disappointed in story line, on a 10 rating, I would rate it at 6.5.Film quality is quite good. Very believable, but I still wasn't that impressed."
5,Wow - great story!,"The movie not only contained some excellent action sequences, but it also delivered on the story line. I know my son enjoyed the movie for the action and the way the cameras put you right into the action. Our hats are off to the men & women who put their life on the line for our country!"
3,Act of Valor,It was ok. I just didn't have that something to pull you into the movie. It was just average in my opinion.
3,Good,"In this movie, the acting is not that great. However, there's not much of it as there's a TON of action. The action sequences completely make up for the bad acting, and they're made all the better when you realize, these guys did/do this in real life."
3,Just O.K.,Lost of action little on story line. Got a little boring towards the end. Could have been done much better if a s tory was behind the action taken.
3,Gun-ho,Ok acting but good action scenes; worth a watch for a home rental. Keep in mind these are not real actors.
2,"""Realistic""","There is a reason people like movies and TV shows with actors in them. It because you get really engaged in the characters because actors bring them to life. When u have really navy SEALs in the movie the execution of all of the tactical stuff is all accurate but the plot line and the horrible acting at every no actions sequence makes is almost painful to watch. The movie feels like a really long add to join the US NAVY, only you paid to watch the movie instead of it interrupting a TV show. While it was a good idea and possibly a fresh approach to war movies it didnt turn out well and is certainly not going to be known in the future as one of the better war movies."
1,Bad experience,The movie seemed very good BUT my viewing experience was AWFUL!!!. The streaming was interrupted three times and I had to start over each time until I gave up. We have streamed movies in the past with out difficulty but this time it was a BUMMER!!!
1,DVD will not work in my American DVD player,"This is a great movie, but I have only seen it on my laptop computer. It will not play on either of the DVD players that I bought from Best Buy in the USA, and it won't play in my portable region-free DVD player. I haven't had any problems with any of the other movies I've rented or bought in America, but this one just won't play. This is very frustrating. And no, I'm not stupid--this is the standard version, not the Blue Ray, and it won't play in my DVD player that is Blue Ray. I recommend you don't buy this movie on Amazon. Get it in a real store."
1,Horribly simpleton movie,This movie has not just a few problems :1) Absolutely terrible acting. I'm pretty sure I've never seen a movie with worse acting than this.2) A plot line that has more holes than Swiss Cheese. It makes my 12-year old brother's scripts seem like Shakespearean pieces of work3) Over-the-top nationalistic and patriotic overtures. Makes me feel like I'm watching a brain-washing movie about our greater-than-thou military might.This movie made me completely lose trust and hope in Amazon's Reviews.
3,"Overall, pretty good","I thought the dialogue parts were a bit cheesy. But the action parts, the parts were acts if valor were portrayed were fantastic!"
5,Great action film!,"A group of Navy Seals are on a mission to stop an Islamic radical who is working with a drug smuggler to commit terrorist acts. What makes this movie unique is that the Navy Seals are the real deal, not stuntmen and professional actors. Their lack of training in regards to acting is apparent, but that does not detract from the excitement throughout as they engage in realistic combat missions against the bad guys. The film successfully combines the action of the Seals with actors portraying other characters to make a very exciting combat action movie that will stir your patriotic senses."
5,Great movie,Great movie. Makes me realize just how Evil these enemies are.The sooner people realize this this the better off we will be.
3,"Fun, but little depth, realism stretched","Some good scenes, murphy is strangely absent throughout most of the fighting and plans go off without a hitch generally."
3,Amazing.,"It's amazing what these elite human beings do for our country, I will never dispute that but perhaps this was better served to be produced as a documentary rather than a movie. That approach would have made fewer $ in the box office but definitely resulted in a better product."
5,Act of Valor,"The movie was excellent. Yes, the acting was a bit stiff, but they are servicemen, not actors. The story was interesting and the action seens held your interest."
3,Not bad,"Not bad but honestly not that great. Some of the acting is really cheesy, but its a ok movie i guess"
5,good,The movie was good. Just wasn't my kinda of movie. But it shows what they have to go through in there jobs in the military.
3,"Good action, weak plot","Movie seemed to be a compilation of individual shorts that were melded together via a weak plot. Good action; moderate acting; SEALs being SEALs. Had hoped for better plot line, but still an overall good movie."
3,Just your run of the mill action flick with a twist,Yeah yeah i know its got real soldiers in it but come on couldnt they have just kept them to the action shots...oh wait there was real actors in it? Terrible dialog good action scenes and that's about it.
5,Awesome Movie,True lives showing what realworld situations and decisions that have to be made on a moments notice. Great job Seals!
4,Worth Watching,"Predictable story, but it's kind of fun saying, ""I knew that was coming!"" A guy film, lots of blowing stuff up, complete with a great car chase."
5,must see movie,This is the most amazing movie and it is awesome! It is amazing what our troops are taught to do in the line of fire and duty. How they sacrifice their own lives for those they are there to defend not to mention each other.
3,Not really a movie,"Even though this film engaged you like a high quality action film, you can't escape the feeling that it's a glorified armed forces commercial, and that' probably because the actors are portraying roles they do professionally. There is simply too many hints of military marketing, but man is it cool to see how these guys operate. Worth renting, but without your (female) significant other."
3,GOOD !!,FOR THE PRICE ! IT DID AWSOME! I REALLY LIKE IT! IT HOLDS THE CAP VERY GOOD ......I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN! :) I RECOMENDED !
1,disappointed,I lost my previous lens cap holder so I was excited to find a replacement. Worked well for about 2 minutes...then it broke!! It snapped right where the it's clasped together & definitely not fixable. So disappointed because it is much needed.
5,absolutely a beautiful watch!,"I purchase this watch for my husband for his birthday. It's the first time I have purchased a watch over the internet without seeing it in person. When I received it, I was so excited because it was nicer than it look online!! It is lightweight, classy, it doesn't need any batteries and you can either dress it up or down. I was so excited about the watch that I gave it to my husband before his birthday. Let me tell you, he absolutely loved it and it fit all his needs! He got so many compliments on it! It was definitely worth the purchase!!"
5,Simplicity is the key,I bought this watch for my boyfriend's Christmas gift this year and it is pretty good. The looks arent bad and its nice and simple. The good thing about this watch is it runs on solar power and it is water proof. I would definately recommend this watch to anyone who's looking for a nice watch at a nice price. This watch is usually around $250 so this is a very good deal.
5,Los Frijoles Mágicos,Este libro que se llama Juan Y Los Frijoles Mágicos era muy interesante porqueTenia frijoles mágicos y había un gigante y decía ¡huele a sangre humana! El gigante tenia una gallina que ponia huevos de... y Juan la queria. ¿Será que agarrará la gallina? Yo aprendi que ser pobre no significa que vales menos. Los invito a leer el libro y se que les va ha gustar mucho. Joshua F.
3,Not what I remember,"Simply put this dvd, as special features claims has been digitally remastered, still needs alot of work. There is evidence of cuts in the movie and scratches; and the great voluptuos Sarli, is but a figment of my imagination. I remember going to see her movies when I was a teen at my local Spanish theater. Shame on Image to allow this quality to be issued for purchase. The 2nd feature The Female is very artsie but not even a quick glimpse of Sarli's voluptuos torso.This is not the voluptuos Sarli I remember."
2,Isabel Sarli,"Bad Movie, It seems that Isabel Sarli was really desperate for work when this film wasmade."
3,Average movie overall.,"This is the second Lupin movie released by Funimation. Since the movie was made around the year 2000, all of the character designs look very modern.This movie reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Fujiko is working for the man who inspired the character James Bond. That man is president of an insurance company. Once the Euro tunnel collapses, that man has to come up with the cash to pay for repairs and reconstruction. So, he and his grand daughter with the Lupin gang, go off to Southeast asia to look for some buried treasure. Treasure hunting is a concept that I believe is being overused in the Lupin movies. The entire gang is being followed and chased by a large number of Nazis who are also after the treasure of Harimao... This is a movie that is following the same formula for the same Lupins movies of the past. I would only suggest this movie if you are a die hard Lupin fan."
1,Misleading and false labeling,Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure is never directed by Miyazaki or Takahata.Do not expect Ghibli's quality in this movie. I hate jigen and goemon's personality in this TV Special series such as
3,k wahlers,"i ordered a kit doll house and it turned out great for my granddaughter, but it came with no instructions. The point being if I was not a carpenter, a normal person might have a problem putting this together because it has over 150 parts of wood and pegs and pieces that only fit one way. The picture on the box(outside of box) was the only saving grace. But the house turned out very sturdy and came with nice furniture for my grandchild. I also will note that I called the distributor and they informed me that no instructions come with the kit, so you are on your own. Thanks, K Wahlers"
3,not the best,"this item looked like it would be sturdy enough for my kids, but when it arrived some of the pieces were broke. had to have my dad make replacement pieces because i sure wasn't going to trust the company to ship me some more broken pieces."
3,"Its alright, kinda boring","We finally get to see Vegetto, it is okay, he is pretty powerful and theres some action, but there is one big flaw.Vegetto needs to stop playing around with Buu and just destroy him. Every episode is Vegetto saying some stupid catch phrase and then waiting for Buu to attack. Akira Toriyama really should have ended this series with Vegetto, and not have Vegetto just play around for tons of episodes. I mean cmon, one kamehameha or spirit bomb could have killed buu in seconds, but instead Vegetto had to ruin that by just do nothing. He did some stuff, there were some cool explosions, but nothing serious really."
5,Saiyajin no ouji orowa baka-desu boo-kun.,"This is a terrific DVD. Vegetto is formed and fights Super Buu. I rank this so high because it is one of the best fights in dragonball. This DVD is nearly the last time you see Vegetto (he is seen in the next DVD until a)Buu turns him to Candy and b) Buu absorbs him causing the Fusion to wear off). This is the last Fusion seen in Z except for Movie 12. Vegetto does very well against Buu despite being Cocky and arrogant. Definately worth the buy, even if you buy it for the Funi dub."
1,Dissatisfied customer,"I bought this TV less than a year ago for my condo up-north. It worked great when it was new but when I returned this summer to use the TV it would not come out of ""stand by"" mode. I returned the TV to Casio within the one year warranty however they would not repair the TV unless I paid them an additional $150.00. Addtionaly, Casio has no basis to deny this claim (there was no reason for this unit to malfunction)and I will be seaking legal action against Casio! Buyer BEWARE!!!"
2,"Kill me, please","This book is supposed to follow the timeline of American History (Pre-Civil War)... however, in an effort to have the reader draw parallels within these times, the author skips back and forth through time, often in long tangents. Not the worst book ever, but definitely not the best!"
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINXP,"Windows XP, will not install the software and drivers and trying to substitute drivers by trying to use other gaming device options all failed. I think Microsoft or Gillemot should be sued, my Vissioneer 6100 scanner won't work with xp either, the software will NOT load. Its a gimmick, if you buy an undated computer, your old hardware may not be usable, such as my Thrustmaster Nascar Pro. It worked well under Win 98se but as I said, could NOT get it to work at all, with my WIN XP."
1,disappointed- WRONG EDITION,I thought I was getting the one in the metal box like pictured. I received the one in the cardboard box and it's already banged up.
5,The Best Dragon Ball Z Movie Ever!,"If you've ever seen a dragon ball z movie you know what they're like.Some of them for example like this one is excellent. Others however like movie #4 aren't to great.Okay, on to the DVD. This DVD is awesome it includes three versions. English Dub, Japanese version, and English dub dolby digital 5.1 surround sound version.As far as the movie,in my opinion this is the best dbz movie ever.It has a very interesting plot,exciting fight scenes and the fact that a hero with incredible strength and his will to never give up makes this movie one for any anime fan.OH yeah i almost forgot the DVD will have other extra features to.Overall I give this movie a 5 out of 5. [....]"
5,Better than COOLER'S REVENGE!,"Compared to the it's sister video, COOLER'S REVENGE, THE RETURN OF COOLER is soooo much better. This video is the first, of those I own, that has Vegeta involved. When Vegeta figures he can't fight Cooler on his own, Goku says they must work together. Of course, Vegeta says stay out of his way, but he doesn't do ANYTHING to stop Goku from helping him! I was impressed and shocked. In COOLER'S REVENGE, Goku doesn't turn Super Saiyan until the end - bummer-, but in THE RETURN OF COOLER, just when you think Vegeta and Goku couldn't be their super selves anymore, they prove you wrong! I recommend for anyone who either has or has not seen COOLER'S REVENGE to get this video. You will not be disappointed!"
3,"""Cooler's Revenge was better...""","I won't lie to you, this is indeed a good DBZ movie, but Cooler's Revenge was much better and had all that hard rock music in it. There is no Disturbed or Drowning Pool to be heard in this, all the music is composed, no words. Meta-Cooler sounded really great, though, his voice echoed slightly, like any robot's voice should. This one has Super Saiyans, and is the first movie in which Vegeta appears. Of course, you wonder how he knew where to find Cooler and Goku, he just kind of shows up. Vegeta has a cool voice, sounds very serious, and ready to punch Meta-Cooler's head off, but he doesn't succeed in doing so, not without Goku's help. The ending is good, but I don't know if it was necessary for there to be a giant Meta-Cooler towards the end, it's kind of weird. DBZ Return of Cooler is one you should get, but don't expect fusions or Gotenks or anything, it's still too early for that."
1,Dbz Rocks EDITED VERSION SUCKS IDIOTS BUY UNCUT,"What a bunch of idiot people no offense buy the uncut version for less then 2 bucks more you get orignal japenese with subtitles and english uncut i swear over 10,000 people brought the edited and way less the uncut YOUR WASTING YOUR MONEY ON EDITED! BUT DBZ THE GREAT WAY Uncut Funimation i thank you for uncut with oringal japenese. I am buying on the dvd uncut now"
1,Edited Version ... Get Uncut,for [only a little] more you get the English uncut and oringal japense Its 20x better more blood nudity language PG13 up
3,ok.,"First of all I am not a kid. Okay lets start with the review.1. This movie has excellent fighting scenes2. This movie has ALOT of those crappy scenes where they are trying to be ""funny"" and that really ruins the movie :|3. This movie has no music, it has those default DBZ tunes, but it has no soundtrack from rock bands like the broly movie does or the other movies.----------------------------------------------------------------Overall: This movie is ok, I liked it but it wasnt the best, its just ok. what really gives this movie a downside is all those corny scenes and the fact that it has no good music.but its worth buying. (belive me this is not the type of DBZ movie you'll want to watch with a friend. alot of the scenes are corny)"
3,Metal Cooler!!,I saw this movie in Japanese however found that it was [utterly bad]! It is a bad conversion of the Metallic Freiza only this time with cooler. The plus sides to this film would be the constant fight that Gokou and Vegeta both Super Saiyan have with an army of metal coolers. This movie will no doubtfully be dubbed with the usualy heavy metal music that funimation has a habit of using in there movie dubs however fans will no doubtfully be able to look forward to the original japanese version on the dvd as well!
5,Awesome movie,"This movie wass great. Goku and the gang travel to new namek to see what is wrong. They get there and the nameks are being ordered into Cooler's ship. So they Help them, Gohan Piccolo and Krillin fight Robots wile Goku fights Metal Cooler. Vegeta shows up saying ""you shall spill no Saiyin blood today Cooler and the fight is on. It has 3 version English Stereo, English Dolby 5.1 and Japanese Stereo all uncut. This DVD has extras including cast Q&A's about them and their character. Character summaries(only the one's in the movie) if Labs toy preveiw(not the commercial something different), trailers for other movies, and finally DVD credits.Music 7(better than some people said)Story 9Fights 10Animation 9Extras 7Overall Rating9But it today"
4,cooler,"Cooler is basically in this. If you like super saiyan you will love, if u think fusing is in here it is not i repeat not. It is pretty good i have seen the japenese version dubbed in english. Also the commercial. This is VEGETA'S FIRST MOVIE movie 6. The next movie VEGETA is in is movie 7. VEGETA is the one who is in this because he has a score to settle with Freiza but takes out on Meta (metal) Cooler."
3,A kids review,This Dragon ball z moive it had a plastic wrap around it and i bought it newand when i got the plastic wrap off the case the dvd was scartched and it had like 8 light scratches on it and the case had like a dent in it. i think the seller might have used it.
2,Mabis Talking Thermometer dissapointment.,Ordered three. One failed out of package. That's a failure rate of 33%. Still waiting for a replacement under warranty.
2,Tether ball set/They never sent the ball.,The poles came for the tetherball set but I never got the ball. I had to go out and buy one separately to make it for Chritmas and I purchased this set well in advance. Still havn't received the ball.
1,Took pole down after less than 24 hours.,"Took pole down after less than 24 hours. Unstable, moves all the time, fell apart in the middle of the game impossible to play with.I am rerurning this item asap!"
4,Great Ideas!,I love this book! I can see how my students will love it too. I can't wait to see how they will react to the comic strips.
4,"Great for ""Do Now"" assignments.","I purchased this book for a special ed math class back when I was a H.S. math teacher. I found it to be really helpful and the students enjoyed it. It afforded me a nice transition into the lesson. When I left teaching, I passed the book on to my wife who teaches middle school math and her students thought it was corny but got upset when she didn't use them for the ""Do Now"" assignments. They got attached to Moovis and Woovis. Its great for basic math skills but not more than that and you can't really build a lesson around it. The title was slightly misleading to me because I thought it used an assortment of comic strips from comic books and/or newspapers...a bit of Spiderman, Dagwood, etc. It uses its own characters from its own universe."
5,GREAT resource!!,"I have used this book in my 4th grade Math classes for years and recommend it highly!! The cartoons are corny funny so sometimes the kids have to think about them, but the problems are what's so great. The math involved is really simple, but the problems make the kids think. At my grade it really challenges the bright kids. Also on some pages, the kids start to realize that you can use work from previous problems to help you out. I have them show their work on the back of the paper.I have even had middle school teachers email me and ask me about the ""Moovis"" program that I am using. (Moovis is the name of one of the characters, so I call them the ""Moovis Papers."")If you are a teacher or parent with upper elementary kids, get a copy. And, thankfully, the answers are in the back!"
1,Dead after 45 days....,"Just long enough to convince me I didnt need the receipt, therefore no return possible. And any one who has a problem has to jump through hoops to get it fixed by D-link."
2,"OK for connectivity, not so OK if you want large transfers","I have this card installed in my Linux box. Had to compile driverto get it working. Read a comment from the author of the driverthat this was an ""entry level card, more for connectivity thanfor performance"" and, in my opinion, this has turned out to betrue. It is fine for everyday operation -- transfer a few filesaround, access resources remotely, etc. However, the card hashung my machine reliably everytime I attempt large file transfers(>25MB), requiring a hard reboot. I searched around on the netand found several people had the same experience. So buy withcaution!"
4,Good Card. Careful during installation,"This card is worth the money. However, make sure you install the drivers for the NIC card first as it will lock up your PC on bootup without doing this first. It clearly says this in the installation documentation though, but...who reads that.I had no issues with the RJ45 not snapping into place as another review stated. It has been working fine for weeks now on my parents computer."
4,Excellent card,"Installed onto a pentium II w/ windows XP. Installed the drivers from the disc and then the card. Took 10 mins. Worked immediately. Excellent for the price. Only 4/5 b/c i've had it for only 30 mins. If it lasts, i'll give it 5/5."
3,WARNING - A Good Card BUT Painful Installations,"Warning! Recently, I upgraded one of my computer system with the new D-Link DFE-530TX network card and it destroyed my network system configuration file. After I installed their network driver that came with it (installation CDs) I was not able to connect to the Internet. Other computer systems that was on the same router had (no problems) access to the Internet so I knew my network router/cable were fine. I tried to dial out to the Internet but it also failed. Finally, after several hrs debugging the cause of my network problems was D-Link driver installation (CD). It corrupted my MS Windows Winsock file. I had to delete and installed a new Winsock file + Updated the Registry. Overall, the network card is OK but it does KO your MS Windows Winsock file. Used Intel and Linksys network cards with no problems - smooth and paineless installation. In the future, I will stay away from D-Link products and stick with Intel and Linksys."
5,Another great product from D-Link,"I'm one of those people that would rather keep reusing old computer parts until they completely die than buy new ones; network cards, after all, haven't changed much in the past 6 years. Recently, however, I decided to switch my hub to 100baseT as it worked faster than the dual-mode I was using. Suddenly, my old card became obselete (well, on THAT switch at least) and I did some research into the latest crop of LAN cards out there. D-Link is very highly rated across the board, and I settled on this particular card. My system automagically recognized it, my switch latched on to it, and have not had a problem with it at all. It even happily coexists with the 6 year old 10baseT combo token ring/RJ45 card!Summary: If you need a LAN card, you can't go wrong with D-Link."
2,Poor W2K Driver -- No Support,"I purchased this product as a second NIC for a Windows 2000 Server. I like the fact that the DFE-530TX+ was easy to reconfigure for a low-profile PCI slot (it has both full-height and low-profile brackets in the box).Unfortunately when I installed the drivers and rebooted I got the ""blue screen of death"". I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times per the documentation, I downloaded the latest version, etc. to no avail.So I called tech support. I waited on hold for 8.5 hours before I gave up the first time. Altogether I called tech support about 9 times. 2-3 times after drilling down their phone menu the system was silent for a few minutes and then disconnected me. I never did speak to a tech support person.If the drivers actually work with your OS it may be a good product, but I would certainly avoid it if you're running W2K."
2,DFE-530TX+ is not compatible with Windows 7,"I bought the DFE-530TX+ last year to use with Windows XP and it worked fine.I have since switched to Windows 7 and even though the adapter is listed on the Microsoft Compatibility web page as being compatible I have found out that it really is not. Do a search on this adapter, or any d-link adapter, and you will find that there is a lot of trouble getting them to work with Windows 7.Time to buy a different card.*Edit: My DFE-530TX+ is rev E1. Can someone let me know what revision card they have received recently from amazon?"
1,Terrible for Linux,"its ok for windows, but since it uses a Realtek chipset, its terrible under linux, you have to compile the driver. agh.Simontek"
3,Buy a LinkSys! NOT THE D-LINK!,"I had nothing but trouble with this card. First off it took me forever to install the software for the card...and it isn't as though I am running a (s)low end PC here! (650MHZ PIII, 32x CD-ROM, 160 MB Ram, etc.) Then, the instruction pamphlets read like stereo instructions! I thought companies were supposed to be creating these things ""easier to use""...not with this product! To top things off, Windows 98 SE didn't recognize the product until I restarted the computer for the third time. Then, after it was finally installed, it kept dropping data packets when I connected it to my MediaOne Road Runner. I had had enough! I took it back, and then went out and spent $40 on a Linksys...it took 1/2 the time to install the software, and it worked perfectly after the first try...no data loss!"
3,"Easy install, questionable quality","I read a good many reviews before selecting the d-link nic card. I found the install easy and trouble free- but the quality isn't what I'd expected. The RJ45 connection is poor (cable doesn't lock in) and I've lost my connection several times, having to remove the card to get a proper connection. This may well be a faulty card, but I can only speak from my experience with the one, which thus far has not been great."
5,Great card!,"I bought this card over 6 months ago, and it has worked great. The physical (PCI) installation is simple and straightforward. The driver installation on floppy took a little while, till I used the ""help"" folder (in DOS window) and reviewed OS specific instructions (W98SE in my case). The manual is skimpy on the driver/software installation. I use it with the DI-704 router which is just great. I called D-Link tech support once on another issue, and they were very helpful. From personal experience I have been extremely pleased and would recommend D-Link and/or Netgear, in terms of product quality and tech support. I have tried Linksys products twice, and returned them, and would never try again due to very marginal performance and even worse tech support."
2,Buggy,"This card embarrassed me. I recommended it to a friend with a Gigabyte mb, and it crashed the machine repeatedly. An obsolete NeXXt card delivered the goods. I was puzzled, as I had used it successfully on an IBM mb and an ASUS mb :("
4,Very good NIC,D-Link is one of my favorite brands so when I need a NIC for a client's computer I found this one. Works just fine in Vista.
1,do not order these network adapter. they are refurbuished 530 devices and the drivers at website do not boot in winxp or linux,DFE-530tx+ are bricked out of the packaged. cards are not detected by windows and linux systems. on top of the instructions are still written for win98 not winxp.. (no support for linux on disk at all).. they make excellent paper weights..
2,defective unit or shoddy construction?,"purchased this case based on the other review. Not sure if I received a defective unit or its just very poorly constructed.One of the latches was mounted improperly, the arm and the lock were both crooked (to each other and in relation to being 'square' to the bag).The extending handle wouldn't retract all the way evenly, one side stuck up slightly.The interior casing and lining along the edge with the extending handle was not attached to anything.That same entire edge started pulling apart after a few days of traveling with several manuals in the case and the case attached by the carry handle to a rollaboard suitcase hook."
4,For every woman navigating life changes,"If you have ever had to look at your life in perspective and ask: ""What about ME?"" then this is the book for you. In a very matter of fact way the author reviews her life from child hood through to mature adult. She eloquently describes the typical woman of her era. But as she ages, she becomes less and less typical and more her own person. I was greatly taken with her desciptions and obvious love for the land and the people. But that alone could not hold her there. Although she is describing her own life journey, many readers will certainly identify with her along the way."
1,As I see It,"I thought this book was simply disgusting. I felt so ashamed being in a bookstore looking into this book. Many times I felt so nauseated looking at it that I had to put it down. It is a shameful book, and I think it is more shameful that these young men should parade their bodies that way. This is what they call art? Originally I did not want to rate the book at all because it does not deserve not even one star, but I had no choice but to rate it. Amazon should give one the choice to give it a ""0"" rating if one feels that the book is really bad. I don't recommend this fetid book to anyone."
2,Interesting in places.,"If you think you know the basic outline of the Silicon Valley Era of the computer industry, this DVD has some interesting interviews with some of the players. Of course, most of them are 20 years older. This stuff was interesting to me, but others have done better, much better in painting a high level portrait of the era."
5,My second favorite Woodiwiss novel!,I have read and reread this book several times and I never tire of it. Ms. Woodiwiss brings the reader so completely into this story that you forget about all else. I love how the poetry introduces each section of the story. The romance and mystery are so well blended that the reader has a hard time guessing what will happen next. I recommend this book to anyone who loves or romance or has never read such a novel before.
2,Eh,"Way too slow-paced. I like long setups, but the characters here didn't grab me to make the investment worthwhile. It went ok for about 250 pages and then became a long, boring slog until the last 50 pages or so, where the big reveal scene was so lopsidedly OTT WTF compared to the rather staid historical that came before it. Messy. I only was able to finish it by skimming."
2,"Ashes in the Wind? Try just ""Long Winded""","I loved the story and the setting, but this book just kept going and going. It took forever just to get the romance set up. I finished it, and liked it, but will not hurry to read it again."
5,Woodiwiss at Her Best!,"I have read each and every one of Kathleen Woodiwiss' novels. ""Ashes in the Wind"" is by far the best! This is one of the most original storylines I have yet to come across in any romance novel. The main character changes her identity so many times that it keeps us on our guessing at who she will be next. There is enough drama and suspense to keep us reading but not so much that it seems it could never happen in real life. On the contrary, this book almost seemed like something that could have happened in real life (the end mght be a little farfetched) but the majority of the book could pass. This, as most of her other novels, would make for a great romantic movie! If you've never read Kathleen Woodiwiss, I suggest this book as well as all of her others!"
4,Not as good as some,This was a little slower than the authors other books. And our heroine got a little soft towards the end.
5,Ashes in the wind,Love this book Its good every time I read it!!!!! I'm glad I bought it Kathleen Woodiwiss is as am amazing author
5,Ashes in The Wind,"It was the most interesting writing I have read in awhile. I would sugjest that any woman who reads this kind of novel, buys this book from you. The Novel is Ashes In The Wind"
5,Ashes in the Wind,"Woodiwiss is such an outstanding storyteller that it should come as no surprise that I found her Civil War era story just as remarkable. Divided into two parts, this one is quite a bit longer and worth the extra time. There is a bit more description than I normally like to read, however the author does a remarkable job in portraying an aspect of life during the war and her protagonists are equally delightful and maddening. Once in a while I'll skip over to the second part since I've read this book multiple times. Endearing characters and a storyline that will pull you in. I never tire of reading her books.Content: There are sexual scenes and though I feel these are tastefully done, the scenes are graphic."
5,ROMANCE!!!,"This is my most favorite book of all time....I purchased it when it was first published, and I read it every year, during the summer.The romance that blossoms between 'Al' and Cole, is timeless, with the right amount of build up to the big climactic finish, just the way any true romance novel should read!!"
5,The Best,Ashes In the Wind is by far one of the best books I've ever read. I started reading Kathleen E. Woodiwiss when I was about 12 and loved her. Ashes was the first book I've read from her. It got me hooked. I now own all of her novels and continue to read them over and over.
5,Beautifully written masterpiece.,This was the first book of Kathleen Woodiwiss's that I read and I'm glad I did for it was the first romance that just didn't rush into and glaze over the whole story. She has great depth of character and scenery. Her style of writing really makes you feel as though you are there seeing the characters. Nothing beats the blurb.
5,She's done it again...,"wOw. This is one of KEW's best books. I LOVED it. She so artfully ties historical facts into the love story that you can almost be there, and all of her research is correct. She is such a talented author, writing classics like, The Flame and the Flower, Shanna, A Rose in Winter, ect. I disagree with people who say that Alaina was too stubborn or that the story was too long or that so many little mysteries tied into one was a bit unreal. Alaina had been through so much, and I found ""Al"" funny and fresh. The book isn't too long in my opinion, and I was sad when I had finished it. I never would have suspected the ending. The way KEW ties it all into one is wonderful, and I really enjoyed this book. Ms. Woodiwiss never ceases to amaze me. I highly recomend this book to any romance fan or, really, to anyone who loves to read. I love this book, and I will come back to read it again and again."
2,Boring interpretation of Gone with the Wind?,"I read somewhere in another reveiw that this book and author was a must read and after reading the majority of the reviews for this book I was persauded to read Ashes in the Wind. I thought it was a terribly drawn out remake of Gone with the Wind. Some parts were so drawn out and boring I simply just skimmed through the pages. Where was the romance? The book could have been half as long and probley still not deserving of 3 stars. Why you ask? Well what's so romantic about a forced romp in the sack with a drunk, or love with a cold hearted woman who would question his masquilinity? The characters were just not appealing or likeable. Sorry. Try Shanna by this author instead."
2,Is this a history book or a romance novel - too wordy!!!,This story is too long-winded. It was so boring I couldn't finish it.
1,not what i wanted.,i asked for large print and it wasnt.i had to throw it away because of the print being to small
3,I did not care too much about it,"It was ok. Very good writing. However, too long, it looked like the author tried to prolong it as much as possible. Too many ""misunderstandings"" between main characters."
3,"Quiet beautiful, but...","The story flow beautifully on the beginning chapters. then, it started to get monotoneus in the middle till the end, and really predictable. It is as if the readers are guide to tell the story not to view it. Worse again, the topics are 'jumpy',from one plot to the other.Overall, it is not so bad, however it is not the best from other of her novels. Still romantic, sweet telling, but not enough description on the man's feeling. Woodiwiss makes the hero sound so childish and dull. I like her ""Elusive Flame"" much much better."
3,too long,while this book kept my interest it was about 200 pages too long..the cat and mouse game between cole and alaina after their marriage was too manipulative and really ruined the story line for too many chapters
4,loved it,"Author Woodiwiss unravels a thrilling tale of romance, set against the backdrop of the war-torn South in 1863. With a strong-willed Confederate heroine who goes undercover as a boy, and ends up working for a handsome Yankee surgeon, sparks are sure to fly. She uses her setting to its fullest, letting her characters come together and be torn apart over and over during the novel's 565 pages. For another sprawling romantic saga with a fiery title, try Egrets to the Flames by Barbara Anton."
2,Ashes in the Wind,I have been reading her books since high school and I absolutely love every one of them - except this one. Too long and drawn out. The characters seem too whiny and uninteresting. I couldn't finish the book without the feeling that I have suffered a long and drawn out torture. Sorry.
3,"it was okay, but not one of my favorites.....","I have read a couple of books by Mrs. Woodiwiss lately and even written a review on Come Love a Stranger. They were all wonderful stories that I enjoyed immensely! I only wish I could say the same for Ashes in the Wind. First of all, the book was just way to long! Then you have the main characters fighting for 3/4 of the book. Lastly, the conclusion of the plot seemed way to coincidental! I hate to spoil the ending for those who choose to read the book anyways, so I won't give it away, but the way she connected the villain to the hero- I was NOT happy! Woodiwiss fans beware...this was not one of her best!"
5,Ashes in the Wind,"I have read this book several times, I love the characters they are so real. They come alive to me on the pages. I have always been a lover of history, especially the Civil War era, and being from Louisiana it just makes this story so very interesting. This has to be my favorite romance of all time, and I am an avid reader,I love Kathleen Woodiwiss, Jennifer Blake, Johanna Lindsey, and Lori Wick."
3,Have Super Glue Handy,"My mother had been wanting something to show the birthstones of both her children, her son-in-law, and her granddaughter that could easily have more birthstones added to it later as her family grows. This piece was perfect and also both attractive and novel. The only problem (as another customer has pointed out) is that the birthstones are too small for the large locket, so they end up just jumbled together at the bottom. My husband suggested using super glue, so I tried that and it worked. Once I glued the relevant gems (top face glued to the inside of the front of the locket), they stayed in place and were all perfectly visible. I don't know how the glue will affect the silver in the future, but without having the gems visible, this pendant was pointless to me."
4,A lot of Kids?,"I got this for my Mom - who has 8 grandkids. I was able to fit all the stones to represent the whole family from Mom and Dad down to the youngest grandchild. The Locket is beautiful and the chain goes through loops on the back that keep the locket closed (to avoid loosing any stones.) The one thing that would make this a 5 star instead of a 4 star review is the chain is not as pretty as the one for the smaller locket like this one. I realize it needs to be a little more heavy duty because of the size of the locket, but it could still be a little nicer. I'm going to look for a nicer one and replace it."
1,DO NOT BUY,This necklace is not silver at all. I don't even believe it is gold. My girlfriend went in the shower with it once and it turned this nasty gold-purple color. It is pretty on screen and it was the day we got it. Then it didn't even arrive on time. It is not worth 10 bucks. Such a piece of junk. I wish I could give it no stars. The way it clasps is a pain to the gems are so small they often get caught in it.
1,pretty but poor quality,"This was a very pretty necklace but it constantly would open and the tiny gems would fall out. I had 3 stones in there and within the first month I was down to 1 gem. Also, at about 6 months it looked very old and tarnished, I never wore it in the shower and took good care of it but it still turned that cheap goldish green color cheap jewelry does. If this were a $10 locket I would give it more stars but for the money it's a piece of junk that only looks nice for a very short time. I would suggest buying something else."
2,cheap quality,"The price is great and the actual item looks nice. However, the quality is bad. I bought this for my daughter and she wore it for lesser than 24 hrs and the stone came off. I returned it back the next day. Very unhappy and dissatisfy."
3,Nice concept,I bought this for my mother-in-law and she really likes it. I like the idea of the necklace but it hardly seems worth 70 bucks. It's a good gift for mothers and grandmothers but price should definitely decrease or the quality should increase. Overall it was okay.
5,Better then Picture,Bought this as a Xmas gift for a friend. It is absolutely gorgeous. Locket is not too large and the chain is beautiful. Thinking about buying one for myself.
1,sent wrong stones!!,"I ordered this for my mom, intending to put all of the birthstones of her grandchildren in it. However, I was sent a set of birthstones missing several months and substituting two of other months. Of course, the ones missing were the ones I needed. What a joke! I wouldn't recommend this product to ANYONE!!!"
3,WRONG DESCRIPTION,"Contrary to Product Details, this DVD only has Japanese and English language tracks. I was hoping for French as described. Watch out for similar confusions between languages and subtitles, as this is not the first time it happened."
3,Voyage to a not so great Lupin movie,"I was expecting a Lupin movie cause they are cool, funny with great music and brilliant plots. This on however, was different. The first thing that got on my nerves was the animation. It was really choppy and the drawings were done in a very ridged style which was very different from the one used in the TV series. It remind me of a slide show (only with a stupied plot)."
3,Missing Some Elements But Still Not Bad,"Garage rock comes in many forms as many garage rock listeners know. This music has a punk twist to it that makes one think of the Ramones when listening. Unfortunately, they do not come close to the Ramones in their style and they also lack the retro sound that great modern garage rock bands have. Nonetheless, if you find this somewhere and have nothing better to buy, this won't be that much of a disappointment. If you forget the great garage rock acts in music history for a moment, this band has a good sound."
3,Works OK...,I spent $40 a month in quarters at the laundry and I thought this could save some money. It did and it is okay. I gave it to my brother to use at college after I moved and got a full size washer and dryer. You have to be careful not to put too much in it goes off balance- my brother did it all the time. Also a little detergent goes a long way. The only other draw back can get annoying. It tends to tangle and twist the clothes together. For some reason the end of cycle is marked with a Jingle Bells tune that this washer plays. You will forever associate Jingle Bells with laundry after using this washer.
5,One of my best purchasing decisions,"I got my Haier 4.9 washer direct from AMAZON nearly two years ago for a holiday discount and with free shipping ... total delivered cost $144. I've been completely thrilled with the product ever since (it's washing some clothes for me right now).A friend admired my washer, so I called him when Target locally had them on sale for $149. Target didn't have them in stock, and it took several weeks for him to receive his washer. When he got it, though ... he was happy with it.I talked another friend into buying one, just yesterday. I let him watch mine in action ... explaining to him that this is a REAL WASHING MACHINE even though the compact size makes it look almost like a toy.I could not be more happy with my Haier washer! Maybe it's because I hated going to laundromats SO MUCH. I would recommend this purchase highly, based on my experience over time with this machine. If you can get it on sale as we did ... so much the better!"
1,Defective washer - had to return it,"I was very disappointed with this compact washer. Almost always, it turned off before starting the drain and spin. On the two occasions when it did not turn off, the water poured out from the bottom of the unit all over the floor (fortunately near a basement drain)."
3,"OK, but the low-budget model","This model was my first epilator. Compared to other epilators: it does work on batteries, and is not as loud as most others, so that is convenient. But--the big drawback--it does not remove hair as well as the more pricey models. It removes some hair, but other hair, I went over again and again and the hair still sat there untouched. I love epilators, but I recommend that you spend a bit more for better quality. What good is an epilator that does not epilate? The Emjoi Gently Gold carress is rechargeable, and works well, but I think the Emjoi Optima and Braun silk-epil, both corded, do the best job. Check them out before you buy this one."
4,"WHERE IS THE ""WHO'S THAT GIRL ""X-TENDED VERSION??","ANNIE AND DAVE listen up: you put that throaway lentil song from the 12"" and not the original long BRILLIANT version of WHO'S THAT GIRL with the crushing guitar that goes on and on ......I don't get it - I really don't. Why don't these people call me before making such absurd choices. So, So severely disappointed. Sound IS great though. But I still have to play my 12"" vinyl to hear that version."
4,"Very easy to play, impossible to master!","This theremin does not have a linear scale, unlike the (now defunct) Etherwave Pro. It is easy to set up (all you need is a mic stand and an amp), and a LOT of fun to play. You have control over the sensitivities of the volume antenna and the pitch antenna, you can control the waveform and the brightness of the sound, which gives it whatever character you want. It is tremendous fun to play, but one of my cats does not like the sound of it and tries to stop me from playing it within minutes of my starting. Endless hours of fun, if you don't have a cat/critic."
3,Fun for younger kids...2-4,"This is an adorable and engaging toy. Eeyore first asks a question then needs to be activiated again for an answer. The limit of the answers to ""Yes and No"" is more suitable to younger children."
2,"Really cute, but what did he say?","I just came from [the store] where I tried this out for myself. VERY cute but if the ""talking"" aspect is important to you, then pass on this one. Never underestimate the power of a talking toy. This will likely be your child's motivation to speak(second only to you), but only if its loud and clear. The voice is way too low and muffled. I believe in quality not quantity when it comes to my kid's toys. Go and demo this before you toss your money away. If this is the best Disney can do with 4.5 BILLION per year in its POOH profits alone then that's pretty sad. It's a shame as I love the character so much, but this toy just doesn't do it. I can't rate the durability as I passed on this one, but I see potential for problems with the motorized ears as this is the first thing a child would grab, and they are the most fragile part. Jack up the sound and limit the animatronics to the mouth. This would up the points for fun, educational AND durability."
5,Great gift,"I bought this for my co-workers son who just turned 2. He was afraid of it at first, but his parents said by the end of the day he was hugging him."
5,A great bargain!!!,"We just received this toy yesterday and were immediately delighted with it! We purchased it as A X-mas gift for our 3-year old niece but even my 4-month old son broke out in giggles when we pulled it out to have a look. It is classic Eeyore with a high tech twist, and even though he's not truly ""interactive"" he's just as entertaining as if he were. His responses are easily understandable and so endearing, I don't know of a child who wouldn't immediately love him...."
4,Seems Like a Fun Toy,"This s quite a bargain and lots of fun!!!!! I hope that my son will love this toy. I love it anyway!!! I bought it for Christmas when he will be 8 months old. Eeyore""s hiding right now!! Kristen"
3,not what you might think,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be a great chance to see the Dresden Staatskapelle in action under Sinopoli. While the playing is excellent, you only get *see* about half of it. The rest of the time you are presented with various footage paired to the different works. While these images and clips are very interesting as well, it was not exactly what I set out to buy. Oh, and the ""striking electronic graphics"" left me a little underwhelmed.If you know what you're getting into and what this shows all about, go for it."
2,Maybe it's too essential,"First I apologize for my English. As a Reference book it can be good, but I don't think this is a ""gap-filling"" reference, as someone say. The listing is complete, but the critique is too short; I expected much more. There are some mistakes in text and lack of data (for instance, where is the review of ""Tokyo Decadence"" ?)"
3,"Completist, but a little shallow","For an introduction to the odder end of Japanese cinema this is pretty good. There are a lot of films covered, though the descriptions are somewhat sparse, and in certain cases downright misleading (ie 'Bounce Ko Gals' is described as ""a respectable sex film""). Also a lot of typos and internal consistencies, and some startling omissions ('Kamikaze Taxi' and 'Tokyo Decadence' for exammple). This seems to be more of a catalogue for Weisser's own semi-legi 'Video Search of Miami' business. Also, it misses out on a lot of films which are covered in his other books, but once you've got one of these books, you're not going to want them all. The writing style is somewhat 'head-in-the-trough' and sensationalist. Similarly it is poorly laid out, though if all this sounds a little negative, it is the only conclusive coverage of Japanese cinema at its price range."
2,Ilona,My copy is as good as this one. There is the same skip on this copy as my original one I bought many years ago.
1,Don't pay a dime for this product,"I don't believe that this is an official release. There are audio/videos of performances like this available for free all over the internet. This seller most likely downloaded this ""rare"" performance from a peer sharing website, burned it to CD/DVD, and wants to sell it to you for big money. Ch-ching!!!Before you buy this ask yourself, ""Have I ever heard of this release before? Are the artists getting paid a dime for this?Is this a BOOTLEG RECORDING?"
3,Not your average R&B record,"Governor is the newest R&B crooner to be signed to a rapper's label. But unlike Bobby Valentino who favors romance & seduction, Governor has more in common in with Donny Hathway & Lyfe Jennings. I was initially disappointed by the CD because it lacks those baby maker slow jams but after giving the CD a second listen I found the CD to be more social & political than sexual. Governor is at his best on Blood, Sweat & Tears, Slow Down & Forgive Me but the rest of the CD is by the numbers. T.I. is wasted on his featured track, but Governor does show some promise. Instinct tells me that Grand Hustle Records another male R&B crooner Rashad Morgan also known as Ray-Ray is going to be the label's lover man while Governor will be the exact opposite."
5,Absolutely hot,"Don't sleep on this album. The man mixes that classic soul voice with blues, sermon style spoken word, street cred and awesome writing. Each song tells a story. Love ""Blood, Swet and Tears"" ""I'm On My Way"" ""Destiny"" ""Move Easy"" ... hell I love the entire album. Definitely this is one where you purchase the entire CD as opposed to just downloading a few songs. Get it and you will not be disappointed."
1,Very Tiny...,"Ordered this for a friend's baby (named Gus)...however, when it arrived it looked like I could have fished it out of a crane machine for a dollar. It was kind of embarrassing to even give it as a gift. I had to get something else to give with it. I probably should have read the measurements before buying!"
1,Author's ego trip,"Although I got two thought provoking ideas from it (that could have been said in two sentences), I think this author/model just wanted to have a product out in her name. I wish some REAL super models would put out their own videos. They wouldn't embarrass themselves like this person and their video would be such a waste of time or money."
4,Maple Leaf Cookie Cutter Set,"The lg sizes made nice cookies, however, the cutter had a tendency to shift in shape so that not all cookies came out the same. The smaller cut cookies really didn't hold there shape well; I tried both a sugar cookie dough and pie crust dough."
3,DROKK!ACID BLOOD!,"This comic is better than most Aliens and Aliens Versus comics,but is not one of the best Dredd ones.Some Perps have gotten hold of Aliens eggs.After busting up a protest by illegal ecologists,Dredd is called to an incident at a hospital,just in time to find a baby Alien burst out of a chest.The Verminators are called in to flush the creature out of the hospital ventilation system.But is the Alien alone,that is the question...I did half enjoy this.It might be that the story deserves 3 and a half stars,but Wagner can do better than this.It seems abriviated,with just indications of character development,and a rushed plotline.Zero classic Dredd black humour,and not enough Dredd-menace either.The art is oldstyle punkish simplicity.The artist can only draw about one facial expression,but has improved a bit on the backgrounds and general design.And the Aliens look good.And also,the colours are really well done,and does a lot to bring out a stark ambient."
5,A real chalkboard,This is a very nice chalkboard that does what it is meant to do well. It has weight and substance and reminds me of the old fashioned chalkboards. Writing on it is a pleasure.
1,Lamp life unreliable,I purchased the lamp on June 2009. It worked fine at first but then stopped working at the end of October 2009 which was not even less than 6 months later. These lamps are supposed to last about 3 years if you use it regularly. My projector is in a family room that we only used about twice a week for no more than 5 hours. They took a week to send me a replacment. The lamp stopped working again in early May 2010. I contacted the seller and they said the lamp hours are not reliable. They offered me a discount rate to purchase another one for $149. I was disgusted. I would not purchase another lamp from this seller so that in 6 months it can go out again.D. Markham
3,Questionable life rating...,Your mileage may vary... The original bulb that came with the projector lasted from May to April in our home theater and saw daily use of 2 or so hours. The replacement lasted from April to September with the same usage pattern. I find it very hard to believe the manufacturer stated rating of 3000 hours when we are experiencing something closer to 1000 hours in eco mode.
5,Projector Bulb,It's a bulb. It does what it's supposed to in a projector and that's make an awesome picture. The real test is to see if it last for the advertised 3000 hrs on the economy setting. That should take make me over a year to find out. But so far so good.
1,"I bough tthis lamp on 1/13/2010. Today is 2/22/2010 at 10:52pm, and it blew out. This is my 4th or 5th bulb. Wits End!","I bought this lamp on 1/13/2010. Today is 2/22/2010 at 10:52pm, and it blew out. The package it came in says there is a 90 day warranty, and I wasn't close to hitting that mark this time. I hope they replace the product. This is my 4th or 5th bulb in 3 years. I'm at my wits end as to what to do. I paid good money for my projector, and I don't want it to be a lost investment. I don't have the king of money to keep paying for bulbs. There should be some kind of legal action or refund given in my opinion. I love my projector, but this is ridiculous. I'm starting to wonder who is to blame for this malfunction. Is it Sharp or Texas Instruments?"
1,VERY short life and Amazon won't replace,"I bought one of these bulbs about a month and a half ago. It has ALREADY stopped working. Because it has been over 30 days, Amazon won't replace it or refund my money. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
4,Lamp - Good Price,It was a great price for a good product. We will be purchasing from here again. It was shipped fast too.
2,disappointing,"We've had our Sharp XR10 projector in our church for 6 1/2 years, and usually replace the bulb after about every year and a half. While I'm thrilled that the prices of these bulbs have come down, this one had the shortest life of any we've ever bought. It burned out after only 4 months; really disappointed!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY TOTAL SCAM,I purchased this lamp 110 days ago. The lamp started going dim on Saturday and when I tried to turn it on again would not work. The lamp is installed high so nothing has hit the projector. Of course they will not refund the money. The actual sharp lamp I purchased from sharp the last time lasted 2 YEARS! This one lasted 110 days. This is not even a Sharp Lamp as it is advertised. The representative said they don't actually manufacture. All I know is my old lamp says Sharp on it and it worked for 2 years. This didn't. This is a lot of money to spend to risk having to buy a WHOLE new lamp. I would buy directly from Sharp. What a Scam.
1,THIS SOFTWARE IS VERSION 2006,The software was so old the update links didn't work; Philippine Tech Support is useless; returning to Avanquest tomorrow.
2,not what i expected,This is basic knowledge i was hoping that it was more like Family Lawyer. This really doesnt give you alot of options in its format
1,Not Impressed - Dont Waste your Money on this Product,"I purchased the My Attorney Software for Home and Business at Staples. Loaded it and not impressed plan to return it. I would not purchase this software had I had been demonstrated the software. In speaking with the manager at the Staples store in Falls Church, VA, I am not able to return the software, so I have to deal with the software company directly.I had bought another software product which is unopened, and because of Staples policy I will be returning it for a refund.I think this is how they sell their software, it is not worth the money regardless you are stuck with it so they continue to sell garbage and make money. Once you open it you own it...The only thing we as consumers can do is continue to post these type comments so people veer away from buying it..."
1,Not What The Doctor Ordered,"This package is an older version of this program and although an instruction sheet was enclosed about updating and upgrading, the company will do neither. Unless you pay for an upgrade that is!! I didn't know when I purchased this program that it was the older version, 2006 version, but that may be because I didn't read the fine print. Anyway, I am not happy with this purchase. The first time I have not been satisfied with an Amazon purchase.I have installed the program and although I am using Windows 7 and Avanquest was supposed to send me an update (which they have not done), the program seems to be working fairly well. Only one or two small qliches so far. I like the program, but the distributor - Avanquest - should not insert flyers that they will upgrade the product unless they plan on doing so."
2,I hate the scent,"I just hate the scent. It's probably something personal, but I think people should know. I love fresh fragrances like Cool Water and this one is terrible for me.It lasts very long, which is very positive if you like the scent, so 2 stars."
2,Waste-O-Money,"I was very hopeful that this product would be a convenient product to use on my legs. I think it takes too long to use on my legs and then I'm not happy with the results. I still feel the need to shave. This product does not do a complete enough job. It is great for underarms and perhaps on forearms if you need to epilate that area, but if you want it for legs then save your money."
1,Not a great product,I bought this off of T.V. about 7 years ago. It is an epilator so it hurts. Don't even try to use it on your legs because it WILL NOT work unless you have been growing out your hair there and then I wouldn't know why you would even want one of these anyway. I mainly use it on my bikini area and believe me....it hurts and it takes me about an hour to get all the hair off. The plastic cover on the head was the first thing to break and I am tired of having to replace the batteries. Save your money and buy something else.
3,Could be a great book,"This is a good book for those seeking an initial view of process and BPEL. The book covers the basics of BPEL profile 1.1, and until chapter 4 is a good resource of information. I don't like books that binds the technology to an specific implementation, and that's the case of the book after chapter 4, it binds examples to Oracle BPEL process servers (which I've already used in production and find it a poor implementation) and Microsoft Biz Talk (never used it). It would be much better if more real world examples could be provided instead of specific providers mechanisms for deploying, creating etc. This should be a readers choice, and the product manuals take care of that. I'm a great fan of the author, have read many of his books, this one had everything to be on my top shell, but, if only there was no more chapters after the 4th.Just my 2 cents."
2,Unfunny and grating but interesting nonetheless,"Fans of the Food Network's ""Good Eats"" will find a lot to like in this book that purports to be all about upping your potency and turning your partner on, but in actuality is really a bunch of food trivia. Interesting, yes. Will it improve your sex life? Doubtful.The real turnoff here is the authors' irrepressible need to insert some schticky one-liner in every other paragraph. That would be fine if they were funny. Instead, they're sophomoric and annoying, and they make it difficult to read more than a couple pages at a time. It quickly becomes a test of endurance."
3,Edited songs,"It says the remastered albums were under the supervision of Dave Stewart painstakingly using the original masters.The sound quality has improved but what happened to Sweer Dreams?The version you hear is edited down to barely over three minutes, I would expect to hear the full version after plucking down $14.98.What was Dave Stewart thinking when they were using edited tapes to put on the album?I guessed he figured everything you see today is abbreviated why not abbreviate the songs?Also don't get the new Collection it also has edited versions.The Eurythmics Greatest Hits that came out about ten year ago has full length versions but the sound quality is not as good.So in conclusion you can settle for the edited versions with good sound quality, or get the full version with poorer sound quality.Once again the consumer is out and Dave Stewart makes a mint!"
5,What to know when you order,"I have ordered (3) books by this author, Word 2003 Expert and Specialist and Excel 2003 same edition. I also have the Professional Edition. The author is absolutely fantastic and easy to read and follow. You could teach yourself the programs.However, be specific when it comes time to ordering the book and more importantly pay for expedited shipping. It was difficult in all three situations to get the person selling the book to ship it ON TIME!! 1-2 days should be max for a person to ship it to you regardless what shipping you choose! Took along time to get the books when i paid for expedited shipping and that causes problems if they are for classes."
5,A Great CD,"I'm a Stephen Foster fan and I purchased this CD after listening to Cathy Fink's version of ""My Old Kentucky Home"" on You Tube. The rest of this CD lives up to her wonderful version of that song. Ms. Fink is great songwriter and lyricist who works in a wide range of styles. Her guitar and banjo playing are impeccable. She possesses a beautiful voice. She chose excellent backing musicians for this album. I feel really lucky for having stumbled on this pretty much by accident and can't wait to explore more of her work. (BTW, you HAVE to listen to ""No Tell Hotel"" - a truly amazing song.)"
1,Children's book,"This really is a children's book. It is very short. The pictures are horrible-- washed out black and white, more akin to a pale blue."
5,John Wayne DVD Set - Best of his classics,"If you are a fan of John Wayne's famous OOAK swagger and tough guy drawl, you should own this DVD set. Always a class act, this is certainly some of John Wayne's most memorable 10 gallon hat entertainment. His style and heart were as big as Texas. His acting range is amazing, though seemingly stone faced, true fans always ""get"" his very subtle but sincere emotion. Highly recommended by a ""fan"", I also bought this for my 83 year old father. A great gift!"
5,Great cleansing product,"I love this soap since it cleans very well, and it lasts very long. Japanese products are good fit for Asians."
4,No bed sores after 22 years,"I am mystified why people give this product one star. If they were thinking that for only $20+ they would get a pad and pump, they gotta be kidding them self. There is no mention of the pump being included. Ive used my Beta or Aquatherm air pads for over 22 years of being a quad. I go through a pump every 5-7 years and pads once or twice a year. Now I too wish the pads lasted longer. But $20-30 to buy a air pad and keep from getting a sore is well worth it. A pad that stays inflatted is a good sign that the pad has no leaks and the pump is still tight. Expecting a pad to last two years is a mystery. The pads are plastic and are under pressure. I would assume most people would pitch their air pad after a year just for cleanliness issues. $75 for a pump is a steal as they use to sell for $300."
1,Did not come with pump,"Ordered 2 units, they did not come with the pump, so they were useless without work of finding a pump. Replacements also arrived without pumps. Returned for refund."
4,Wonderful introduction to crocodiles,"Containing wonderful watercolor illustrations of crocodiles, this is an inspiring introduction to life as seen through the eyes of a crocodile. I especially enjoyed the illustration showing the mother crocodile carrying the baby crocodiles in her mouth. My 8 year old daughter and I had read about this in research she did for a project so it was nice to see this scene depicted. My four year old enjoyed and learned from the book as well."
3,Eurythmics and more rock posturing,"Well, it is better than ""Be Yourself Tonight"", but I still miss the Eurythmics signature synth sound. So glad ""Savage"" was up next. That album is a great blending of rockers and techno songs."
3,I want REVENGE D & A,"I adore Eurythmics. Any utterance from the throat of Lennox is music to my ears. The compositions are intact with this LP. What is lacking is the production. Dave moved, I blame him most, into the Heavy Metal riffs with these instrumentations. Having said that, ""Missionary Man"", ""The Last Time"" and ""Let's Go"" still hold the guitar aside the synthesizer. The Light within the Dark isn't nullified by scratching guitars. You'll love the grinding and electronica still used by Dave and Annie. Overall, a good job, but it ain't giving me ""Sweet Dreams""."
4,"Nice smell, small bottle.","Bought item for my gf for her new epilator. Works nice, smells nice, wish it came in a bigger bottle."
2,"Bought in June 2010, used regularly, it doesn't work.","I bought this cream to use in conjunction with epilating, and certainly by now, the end of 2012, it would seem that I shouldn't have hair growing back at all, right? That's not the case in my situation. It doesn't seem to have had any effect at all and I used it exactly as directed. Also, I'm not a fan of the fragrance. Why must fragrance be added to EVERYTHING these days?"
3,So-So,"My biggest complaint is that the bottle leaked during shipping. It came in a bubble wrapped bag so I managed to get some of it back into the bottle, but it's disappointing to throw so much of it away. Not really sure if that's a problem due to poor packaging on amazon's behalf or what, but it seems I paid for half a bottle.I also dislike the fact that this has a screw cap lid, it makes it a bit difficult to squeeze out the right amount without it globbing onto my hands. After using this for about two weeks as directed, it doesn't seem as though my hair is growing out any slower than normal. Perhaps I just regenerate hair at a freakishly fast level, who knows?I find that the lotion takes a bit of time to dry as well. The only positive thing I can say about this product, is that it dries clean and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or coated in a weird film."
4,JURY STILL OUT,"This after-epilation cream is very soothing. However, I shall need more experience with it to tell whether it really inhibits regrowth. It seems to, but I'm a little unsure whether the hair wouldn't grow back at the same rate without it. Probably won't ever really find out, as I'm most likely not going to go without just to get a comparison."
2,eehhh,i dont use the stuff religously so i cant complain but i didnt really find it made such a difference and i didnt like the feel of it or the smell so im not crazy abt it...
3,Ouch!!!!!!,"It's very scary, the sound of grinding only to be followed by pain upon each and every touch to your skin. It seems to be effective but difficult to justify with so much discomfort. I'm still trying and learning how to make it feel better."
4,Excellent product,"For the past 16 years, I've only used an epilation machine for my legs. In the beginning it was an Epilady, but for the past 3 years or so, I've used the Emjoi epilation machine (which I really love, by the way.) I bought the After Epilation Cream when I bought the Emjoi epilator, and it really does what it says. The skin is smoother, hair grows back slowly, and my major concern -- no in-grown hairs. In-grown hairs were always a problem when I used drug store body lotions. I've tried a lot of different products over the years, and I used Shepards Lotion for the longest time. It was pretty good, but Emjoi works much better.The only reason I might not give the product 5 stars is that it seems expensive to me. I don't how many ounces the bottle holds, but I wish it held more for the same price."
3,"Effective, but not the ultimate solution for ingrown hairs","One of the reviewers billed this as the solution to the problem of ingrown hairs, one of the main disadvantages of epilating (besides the pain, of course!). I found it helped for ingrowns, but didn't solve the problem completely. I had fewer itchy red bumps a week or two down the line, but there were still a few. Where it does help a lot is with the redness after epilating - it goes down much more quickly."
2,ehh,"I've been using this after every treatment and the hair is no lighter, thinner or more stunted in growth. This dream doesn't even help irritation..."
3,Flimsy hardware,"I haven't yet had the opportunity to use this product but the manufacturing of how the minature cutters are placed onto the handle is very flimsy & unstable. One of my cutters arrived with the inner cutter detached from the main cutter & when replaced with a different set, one of those arrived detached as well. I tried everything I had on hand to try & glue them together but nothing worked. I wonder how they'll hold up to actual use."
