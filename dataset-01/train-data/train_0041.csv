3,"Obscure, not kid friendly","I was hoping to be able to share these fables with my boys. While reading I found that I had to edit on the fly. Some are not kid friendly. So when you're reading about Mr. Duck and you see that he gets eaten by the lion, you could understand my dilemma. Perhaps this is a good exercise for improvisational reading.Some of the tales are downright puzzling as well. If the moral of the story is saying ""Huh?!?"" then many tales accomplish that objective.I would prefer a book that's edited for 21st Century taste and with appropriate fables for kids. I'm sure the book is faithful to the original literature but that's not what I was looking for here."
4,AWESOME!,"Richard Bishop is awesome, Yeah... I think that's the word, AWESOME!... and quite talented as well."
1,horrible translation of a great story,"I brought the first two volume of this translation. What a complete waste of money. The chinese story is funny, vivid, and full of life. However, this translation sucks all the complexity, life, and wonder from the story. If there were only this translation, no one would care about this story. For those who are only able to know about this chinese story from this translation, they will never understand that this was Jin Yong's (Louis Cha) last and perhaps, greatest novel.It's just really sad that because of this translation, no one else will now do a real translation of this great story in english."
5,awsome,"I own 2 of these runners and install thousands of feet of flooring, you can staple as fast as you can and it works like a champ, I highly recommend this runner"
2,so so good,"Works most of the time, But Id say every 1 out of 5 staples didnt not come even close to sinking into the wood. We spent a lot of time with a hammer and a punch going back over each staple making sure it was flushed. very time consuming."
4,handy floor stapler,"I recently purchased the Bostitch LHF97125-2 hardwood floor stapler and I am very happy with it. The stapler is lightweight and makes moving along the floor easy; as a matter of fact, my 14 year old son also installed some of the floor and had no trouble with the stapler. Since we plan to install more hardwood flooring, the price was worth paying compared to renting one. The entire time I was using it, it never jammed once. The only trouble I had was I had to make sure the firing mechanism was at the right angle.(only because I got going too fast). All in all it was a great purchase."
2,Buy The Staples Online,"I ordered the staple gun and thought that I'd get the staples locally. This was a bad move; I have searched Home Depot, Lowes and a major hardward store in the Dallas Mextroplex without success. Definitely, order the staples when you order the stapler. I will end up ordering the staples online which will push my schedule back 2 weeks due to the Christmas holidays. Whenever I get to use the stapler, I'll let you know how it worked. BTW. I'm laying 1/2 inch 5"" wide hand scraped. I used glue to do my walk in closet and it was so messy and tiresome, but the floor came out beautifully. Hopefully, using the staple down method will be easier.Update: I finally began using the gun. It is easy to use once you get the hang of it and the height adjustment correct. It too me 1 1/2 mins. initially to staple a 5 ft. plank, once I got the hang of it it took about 30 secs. It is definitely great for the DIY installing floors around the house. I would rate the product 4 stars."
1,Recieved Wrong Product,"Cannot believe I waited almost 2 weeks for an LHF 97-125 & got a LHF 2025. Amazon listed the product as a 97-125, I ordered a 97-125, the invoice says 97-125 & I got a 2025!!! I have a job pending on this special gun & the 2025 is not what the manufacturer says to use...what's up with that...! I will be contacting Boston Industrial tomorrow to see why they sent me what I didn't order - without even a heads up!!!On the positive side, they did make full restitution however shipping and all..."
1,It works but has some problems.,"It will staple engineered flooring down but be prepared for more than a few bent and twisted staples. Unless you apply heavy pressure against the flooring the bent staples will damage the edge and you will need to remove it. Perhaps I have a lemon and you will have better luck than I did. Hope it works better for you than it did for me. Update, the stapler failed before I finished the job and I ended up buying a regular staple gun which strangely worked better once I honed my method."
4,Better than Renting,"Bought this to install 5/16"" Oak Hardwood. Tool Rental place wanted $39 a day. Got this for $219 . Wasted a lot of time trouble shooting why it was only firing 4 staples before craping out. Thought the Stapler had a problem but turned out to be my old air hose. Switched out with a new one did the trick. After figuring out the adjustments and setting the right air pressure it worked very well.I would recommend this to anyone and also suggest you buy the Bostitch staples too at the same time. They can be hard to find locally."
1,NO reshipping? automatically REFUND?,"HOW COME IS IT POSSIBLE?I bought this things and cafelatte taste, cell activator, personal protein x3... I don't recommend this seller definitely,,I assert seller should learn how to treat the buyer!I paid money about 172$.... products price was about 133$...(includes taxes)I didn't agree with my refund,but they just do that.... OMG.......W.WI wasn't at home, no body can't get the packages, but I request reshipping,they said, they can't reship before reorder, so we has processed your refundis it resasonable? NO NO NO NO NO No !!!!!!!!!!! I don't think so. I am so exploded...I LOST MY MONEY ABOUT 70$... IF I WERE YOU, I AM NOT GONNA BUY STUFFS FROM THIS SELLER.In the other hand, my other seller said,"" we will reship your package when i get your package"" no adding shipping feehow different both sellers~"
1,Herbalife,I'm not sure whats wrong with this particular shake mix but it tastes real bad. I've never tasted it like this before. Something differnt about it.
1,Ordered one thing and got another of less value/,"I have contacted the seller and he argued with me about what I ordered. I ordered and paid for Protein powder drink mix but got personalized protein powder. The seller argued with me about what I ordered, even though the picture, the price and the description said drink mix. I did not return my order because I didn't feel I could trust the seller after our communications."
1,Made me sick,"It had a good taste but I got sick from drinking it Doctor told me it must have something in there that don'tagree with me., sorry."
2,They took ages to ship this product,I am not reviewing herbalife product here coz i love them. i lost 20 pounds in 5 months...But i have problem with the seller... they took ages to ship this product. i was almost run out of my shake mix.i m not going to order from here again but rather order from some other sites.
1,Great product but horrible taste,I've recently stopped by the store that sells these shakes because I've heard good and bad things about the shakes. I know that they actually do help you lose weight but they are MEAL REPLACERS MEANING THAT THEY WANT YOU TO STOP EATING NORMAL FOOD AND HAVE A SHAKE INSTEAD. People say you get energy and feel so great and lose a lot but at the same time they taste terrible.The flavors are disgusting and since all it is is powder and aloe I could feel the powder in my mouth and throat for a while and also ended up feeling sick. The woman who lost so much weight for these said the only meal she has is dinner.They work but have a terrible taste.
3,Herbalife Healthy Meal,"It so fortunate for me that i have to rate this purchase, it's been over a week now that i have been liaising with the vendor of the item. i purchase this item early December and paid US$58.00 )(the cost of two (2) items ) however I only received one. I have been promised by the vendor that the other item would be shipped to me , and the relevant tracing information would be sent to be , to date i have received nothing."
4,I'm impressed!,"I got this product to make my life a little bit easier after the birth of my third child. I figured it would make for a quick breakfast and might help me lose the baby weight a little faster. So far, I'm impressed. I wake up and already know what I'm making myself for breakfast. I add a banana or strawberries and I'm ready for the crazy day ahead of me! I've found I'm not hungry throughout the morning and end up eating a reasonable lunch. I've lost 25 pounds in the two weeks since the baby's been born (alot of it water weight post-baby, I know), have a good amount of energy (all things considered), am healing from my 3rd c-section well, and exclusively breast-feeding! I couldn't ask for a better system right now, since I can't work out yet. I have never been a meal replacement type person, but this is working for me!"
4,Good product.,The herbalife line of product is very good if you are trying to loose some weight. Taking a shake a day made me lost about 16 lbs in about 2 month without any effort or drastic change in my eating habits.
1,It tastes awful!,"I love Herbalife ShapeWorks shakes but I don't recommend this flavor at all, try anything else but not this."
1,Very slow in processing order.,First time I have used this vendor. Never had a problem with an Amazon vendor. Order has been sitting for 4 days now. I would never use this vendor again!!
3,Better results wanted.,I have used this product before about four years ago and had great results. This time I haven't. Maybe they changed the formula....I don't know. Hoping to give it a few more weeks but so far I haven't lost a pound despite using this and working out.
4,good stuff,"it's good good stuff i say to get it but remember you must combine a workout plan with it, it works"
2,Hmm...,"Ok... I seldom write reviews so here it goes.I have never been on a wheight-loss shake diet and was very skeptical about this product. It is true that after eating it you feel satisfied and the taste is not that bad when you blend it with fresh fruits, but beware! if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross! I made too much once and had to put the remainder in the fridge to drink later. When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad! I'm going to finish up this container and then switch to Kirkland brand wight-loss shakes (the chocolate one is delicious by the way). I hope it really works out for other people, but sadly this product just wasn't for me."
1,FAKE PRODUCT!!!!,"This is not a real product from Herbalife, that's why its cheap. It's fake and won't buy it again. I recommend to purchase Herbalife products only from reliable distributors not online. Most products that are sold online already expired. I will report this to Herbalife!"
3,No accounting for taste.,"The only reason this shake is getting two stars instead of one is because I have lost 7 lbs. in the past four weeks by using the herbalife products. This flavor of shake tastes like chalk and leaves the dark ""cookie"" pieces in the bottom of your cup. It tastes bad and doesn't mix well. The chocolate, vanilla and cafe latte flavored mixes are a vast improvement in the taste department."
3,It is ok...,"Nothing special to write about this product. The shipping was great and just as promised. The product was exactly as pictured. I have tried it and I am not really crazy about it. It taste better in 1% milk than it does in skim milk.I compared it to Medifast and Medifast won hands down. Not a bad product, just not for me."
5,Easy & Safe Weight Loss,"I have been using this product for the past 3 months and it is great, easy and it works! I especially like the French Vanilla because I can add different flavored (low cal) fruit juices to customize my drinks. The other flavors are good too. I have lost 35 pounds in 3 months. Go herbalife!!!"
3,A Romance Junkie,"Anton Luis Scott-Lee and Cristina Marquez had been lovers six years past but Anton was jilted by the Brazilian beauty for some crazy reasons. Now broke and on the verge of losing her beloved estate Anton steps in to save the day....revenge? Hardly, the man is angry and crazy in love with this woman. It starts off with a bang and the heat of this book in the beginning is almost too much. Then nothing, a lot of looking and internal dialogs that drove me nuts. This is the Ramirez series thing and I really didn't care for any of them, but this one was the best of the three, but not great either. It did have a nice ending but no spice at all."
3,Good for 1st and 2nd; not good for 5th grader,"I ordered this for my 5th grader who is struggling with spelling while writing compositions. After we reviewed it, the words do not contain different forms of the words (often the base word only). For a more advanced writer who needs to understand the endings this is not good. However, for a 1st spelling book I think it is ok. I am going to give it to my 2nd grader."
5,Great little spelling aid,My daughter is having difficulty spelling (she's in third grade). She loves this book and uses it often. It's easy for her to find the word she is searching for. She uses it to assist her during Scrabble and when doing her homework.
5,Spelling book,This is a very useful book. I bought several copies to share with my students. I had an earlier version so I got some updated versions.
5,No Happy Ending,"The first 2 disks of Something More Beautiful had a lighter mood than Automatic Maiden (1st season of Mahoromatic), but that changes immediately at episode 10. This story is a tragedy at it's heart and these 5 episodes are a headlong plunge into betrayal and death. Episode 14 tries to give you a little hope to end the series with, but you may want to watch this disk alone if you don't want anyone to see you cry. Do watch it though, this has got to be the finest heroic tragedy in all of anime."
1,Clueless!!,"This movie will leave you staring dumbfounded at your screen in disbelief - that you actually sat through 88 minutes of this appalling excuse for entertainment. The characters were as superficial as the plot was non-existent. A couple of cuss words and Sienna Guillory's breasts were thrown in to give it an R rating but truthfully the DVD box should have carried a government health warning. Whatever you do DO NOT buy this movie. Don't even waste the time or money renting it. Alicia Silverstone and Joe Anderson fail to explore their relationship in any dimension whatsoever, and resort to repeated meant-to-be passionate clinches because they literally have nothing to say to each other. And that's it!"
3,A good movie overly criticized.,I just watched this movie and it was okay. It was not as bad as 'others' think it was. It sounds like they just wanted to see Alicia Silverstone naked. Get a life people!Alicia Silverstone gives a good performance. Sienna Guillory also gives a good effort. This movie has a dark overtone and a sort of flat ending. Watch the whole movie before you start to trash it. IF it is naked poeple you want please rent porno.
2,The Other gone wrong......way wrong!,"Don't you wish you were in Joe Anderson place? Come on, all guys do. Still can that save this movie from total boredom? Probably not. You have 2 ladies trying to have some fun but from watching this....you get the sense that they were little daddy's girls. Trying to have fun yet do not want to disappoint their daddy, whom i assume past away. Alicia tries to be sexy and it shows but the plot is ho hum...boring!I can see some people might like stuff like this but it's not for me. Watch it if your a Clueless fan cuz that is what you will get by watching this....get it?"
3,A LITTLE BIT STRANGE,I DON'T THINK IT IS THE WORST MOVIE I EVER SEEN IT HAS AN INTERESTING CAST AND I WAS WONDERING IF THE GIRLS WAS KIND OF GHOST OR SOMETHING I LIKE THE SCENES IN THE SNOWTHE LOVER SCENE IS GOOD TOO I WAS BORING LITTLE BIT BUT IF I THINK OF THE MOVIE I LIKE IT SO IF YOU LIKE ALICIA SILVERSTONE YOU DON'T SEE HER NAKED BUT YOU CAN SEE SIENNA GUILLORY SO
1,Worst Movie ever made,"This has got to be the worst movie ever made in the history of humankind. The script writer lacks all the atributes that a good writer needs to have, even if you go to her website, her art is aweful and tasteless. I can't beleive any movie company would ever agree to make such a bad movie. It was a waste of my whole one dollar I paid for it in the clearance section."
1,professors and consultants love this book but it's not real,I work on at a large investment bank in NY in the M&A department. I have yet to see any of the McKinsey consultants' formulas in practice. I like the Jeffrey Hooke book on valuation or the Josh Rosenbaum book on LBOs and value. Good luck on finding deals.
5,Great picture very clear excellent sound quality,I bought one about 2 months ago and am very satisfied although I paid a little more for mine. Amazon has a great price I should of waited!!
4,A good first book for HTML programming.,"This book is better than most other books for first time HTML programmers. It gives good introduction on related topics like JavaScript, Java, DHTML, Active X and VBScript. I got a good idea of HTML from this book but I went on to get two more HTML books for better reference and in-depth programming techniques. However, I would NOT recommend this book to someone who already knows basic HTML or who is looking for a good reference book on HTML. One important thing to note is that this book was basically written for HTML 3.2 and later when HTML 4 came, a few last minute changes were made to put 'HTML 4' on the cover. So this book does not cover HTML 4 the way it should."
1,It only hampers your website development,"This book is so tedious and hard to follow. I don't know why the author made simple HTML codes seem so difficult. It was tolerable at first since I knew some HTML already, but then when I got to the advanced part (such as Javascript), it was impossible to grasp the concept. I was so frustrated."
4,Well organized and up-to-date with HTML 4.0,"Normally, I'm not a big fan of ""Sam's Net Books"". However, Mr. Darnell did a very good job with this book. Many of the available HTML books have only a few very small chapters written about HTML and the rest of the chapters are used to skim other languages that require a book in themselves. This book gives a lot of attention to HTML and when I buy a book on HTML, that's what I want! HTML is the core language of the web and this book provides a good working understanding of the latest version, 4.0. It also gives very nice, but not overdone, history lessons about HTML which further help to understand certain conventions. Additional languages are also covered in this book, as they are in most others. It's a lot of reading, but it's very well organized with a nice, clean format."
1,Very poor source of information.,"The proof readers did not do a thorough job checking out this text before it went to print, but I get the feeling from the substandard quality of other ""unleashed"" books that they really don't care. Poor writing, incomplete sections and glaring errors abound. I attempted to use this book a couple of times on things I was stuck on, but found that it only scratched the surface of very basic topics (forms and tables, for example). Examples were particularly unhelpful, and the CD is worthless. It seems like the more pages stuffed into a computer book (notice how the author brags about 1000+pages), the worse the quality of the material inside. However, there must be a lot of suckers out there buying these huge books and paying out of the nose for them, judging from how many huge book series there are."
1,Out of date before it even hit the presses!,HTML 4 has gone through MAJOR revisions since this book was published. Not much here makes sense or even works! Why buy an obviously out of date book? I took the book back. Will NEVER ever buy another book written by Rick Darnel! The problem is made worse by the fact you have to suffer through 300 pages of background material before you ever get to the HTML. This MUST be the authors way of hiding what they knew as major problems. No sugar coating here. JUNK is JUNK!
1,How come a book be so empty ?,When I wanted to publish my own web page I bought this thick and professional looking book and after struggling for some time I gave up and established my web page in half an hour by following the advice given in a document posted by Columbia University Academic Information System.When you but this book you will not only waste your money but also your time. Be careful ! This book looks like an industrial-strength source yet it is only soft kitten-strength !
3,Only for collectors,"I purchased this video thinking it was the American version with Meredith Baxter Birney. Instead, it appears to be a BBC version maybe made for TV. If you can get passed the girls' phony wigs, its really not too bad. However, the girls verge on shrieking at times and some of the acting comes across less than professional. Still, if you enjoy various versions, this is another for the collection."
4,IT'S GOOD.,"I saw it a few years ago. I was very lucky because I watched this rare film. It's a good film that follows well the book. The acting is good. One flaw is that ""Little Women"" in this film seem too old. But I like this film and I want to own it's VHS"
5,Beautiful and Majestic,This is my absolutely favorite cd of Christmas music among the many that I own. Is is absolutely gorgeous. I consider it a must-have!
4,heavy,"The product is OK. It converts 220/110 and 110/220. However it works only for very low demanding appliances (up to 50W) so be careful. It comes with two adapters that alone cost between 5$ to 10$ in airports and big retail stores. So good Deal. Only drawback, it is very heavy and hence should be used with an extension cord on the floor."
2,Travel Converter,"The Converter appears to be fine, except that it only came with the larger plugs used in northern Europe, not the smaller plugs used in southern Europe."
4,Worked perfectly,"I bought it because it was cheap, and it worked perfectly on my trip. No complains.Although I feel there has to be a less-bulky, less-heavy option somewhere."
2,"blew out within one day, complete waste of money","I bought this for a trip to Argentina and Chile. The seller was great, but the product was horrible. It blew out in Buenos Aires on the first day charging a laptop. My roommate on the trip had a Brookstone adapter which worked on all the plugs we encountered. the Brookstone adapter worked on camera chargers, laptops, phone chargers, two different flat irons (hair straightener), and ipod player with speakers. It sparked a few times, but it never blew out. I'm getting one of those for my upcoming trip to France. I wish I had just spent the money the first time instead of wasting it on this piece."
5,"Careful with that axe, William...","This is an inspired compilation, which includes virtually every major BBD classic. As someone else pointed out, Futurama and Sunburst Finish are the best Be Bop albums, but as Futurama is presently unavailable (I managed to pick up a used CD, with the extra tracks) this superb double CD set includes all but three of the Futurama tracks anyway - Stage Whispers, Sound Track and Swan Song.While this set is filled with excellent songs, including relative rarities such as Speed Of The Wind, it was always Nelson's killer guitar solos that turned people into die hard fans. The inclusion of so many Guitar Overkill numbers from Sunburst and Futurama, as well as the classics Axe Victim and Yorkshire Landscape, ensure total satisfaction. Very useful little booklet, too.Absolutely essential purchase for any serious Bill Nelson addict. I'm not one myself, of course... I could stop playing it any time I want... I just... don't want to.. yet..."
2,The Ashen Thief,"I got dissapointed with this book. the ashen knight was a very good book centered in the knighthood, but in this one they lost that focus, the furores chapter shouldn't be in a book about thiefs, should be more in an Ashen Anarchist.The first part about the medieval underworld is good, but they screw up the rest of the book with the furores section."
5,Riders in the sky. Silver Jubilee,"I,m very happy with this cd. I'm a big country and western songs fan and I found this one real good."
5,though captivating allagory of the spiritual life.,this book is not for the closed minded person. it is full of allagorical life in the spiritual sence. i have read this book many times and given it to many of my friends. all of us love it. it is probably one of the most inspired writings since the bible. it makes no theological distinctions that would affend any of the christian faith. what it does do is expand our view of the christian life and the role christ plays in our every day life. a gem of a book even for us of little faith.
5,Never been so blessed,"I have never been so blessed by a book (except for the Bible) as I was when I read this one. It is about everything we can go through as Christians, trials, tribulations, joy, and blessings. The Great Shepherd was the epitomy of everything that Jesus Christ, our Lord is: loving, longsuffering to usward, patient, and understanding. This book blessed my soul tremendously. It made me yearn for a closer relationship with God. I recommend this book to everybody that is on a journey with Christ."
3,Not sure I would buy it again!,"I listened to all of the CD's and read the Encyclopedia Dr. Rosenthal has written. Then today 11/10/10, I took my NCE's. I passed.....yes!! However, it was through no help of the book and very little help from the CD's. I do not think the CD's were helpful to me, maybe just to bring certain names and terminology to mind. The questions on the test seemed to have very little to do with the information I gleaned from the CD's. In many ways it gave me false hope that I was actually going to learn info that I could use to improve my chances of passing the test. I would have been better off going from my own notes and the CACREP areas of study. I could have used the money I spent to a much better use than the CD's."
5,Wonderful study resource,"This product is great, I haven't taken the NCE yet but I have gained a lot of confidence with this product."
3,This thing is enormous!,"I bought this toothbrush for my 3.5 year old. It is much larger than I thought it would be. It is 8"" long, and almost 2"" wide at its widest part, making it as big or larger than a Braun Oral B adult toothbrush.The brush head is larger than an adult Braun Oral B brush head.In addition, the on switch is very hard for a child to click all the way so that it stays running.I think this brush is better suited for a 5+ year old. My child loves the brush, and it does a good job once its locked in the on position."
1,Further beware,"This was a good price for a 1-port power injector so I ordered 2 of them. When they arrived, they weren't even power injectors. They are 1-port power splitters. You put them at the end of a POE run and they separate out the power and feed it to the device using a separate wire, and feed the ethernet to it over an ethernet wire.Utterly useless for my application, and utterly unrelated to what they claim it is. I returned them, but they made me pay the postage on the return. Fie."
5,Get this one,"No theological library can afford the lacuna that would be without this volume! While one may (rightfully) opt to purchase the four volume edition of Bavinck's work, this is still the translation to always have at your elbow. All major discussions of theology are explored and opened up for the serious reader.Of particular interest is the perennial debate of supralapsarian and infralapsarian interpretations. Bavinck is without equal in both explanation and resolution.Bavinck is Reformed, yet those of other theological persuasions will find this volume to be one of the most sound orthodox books in print."
4,Up there with collectable Konitz,Ninety-Six minutes is a lot of music but there is a consistent high quality of performance of 12 tracks over two CD's. Mr Konitz doesn't falter and the interchanges between him and Mr Marsh are as satisfying as ever.The rhythm section is a meeting of legends and the music is good enough for one not to notice occasional recording irregularities. One to own.
4,LIVE LEE!,"The two disc set from Verve features a virtual All-Star line up gathered over two nights at New York's infamous Half-Note nightclub in the winter of 1959. The players are each stylistic vanguards with Paul Motion playing quietly with the sticks and powerfully with the brushes, Jimmy Garrison thumping dangerous bass lines, Bill Evans comping then leading with pretty and intelligent playing, Warne Marsh offering a sugar tenor tonic to Lee Konitz' pepper alto. The music swings and pushes the envelope of the West Coast sound while maintaining a sense of enjoyable interplay between these five Jazz legends. The sound is good and Lee's horn comes across like a mentholated Bon Bon; sweet and sour."
4,Really Good ! BUT it's missing one major part!!! GRRRR!!!!,"I bought this digital drum set and when it arrived at my house i was really excited, i opened it up and found that it didn't come with the DC cord to turn it on and i did not have any of the 6 c size batteries it required or any of the cords to connect it to different speakers so i could not use it at all. i was really mad i had to wait a few days until i could find one of the only 2 DC cords that work, both Yamaha ones and quite hard to find....I tried to DC cords i had but they didn't work because they weren't on of the special Yamaha DC cords you need.However when i did get to try it this drum set was quite good....BUT i had to wait 3 days...and another 7 days for the shipping..... ..."
2,I can make it better!,"I recently purchased a DD50 from ebay - and it was about what I expected. Yamaha make generally good trusty products - but this kit has the same basic flaw as all electronic druma I have tried - that is - the pads do not pick up light strokes - and also don't respond to heavy hits. In other words they don't react anything like real drums.Ok this is a very cheap unit so you get what you pay for right? - well actually - I did design and market electronic drums (analogue type) back in the eighties - and I spent a long time working on this ""response"" thing - eventually getting very impressive results.So when I got the DD50 recently I immediately set about improving things - and I have devised a fairly simple way of improving the response drastically with a bit of add-on circuitry.If you are interested please email me. mickwest1@hotmail.com"
2,Yamaha digital drums kids toys,"When I first tried out my new drum set, I was pretty happy. However, after about thirty hours or so of use the power wouldn't stay on, making jam sessions real hard. The repair shop wanted to charge me the same amount as a new unit to fix it. When I contacted Yamaha directly, they wouldn't have anything to do with me, saying that the unit was seven years old. When I pointed out the unit was purchased only two months previous, they reiterated it was seven years old. These things are only good for kids toys or someone that just wants to fiddle around, not a serious musician. Due to the callous response I recieved from Yamaha, I will never purchase another product of any kind from this manufacturor again"
2,Not really,"This movie portrays backyard wrestling in horrid light, and is not an accurate representation. Not all BYW is about bleeding and crap. Some of the cats in the backyard are trained professionals who just have not found a promotion to join."
4,Very good but I like modern interpretations also,"Ella of course has a rich and beautiful voice. It is also wonderful to have such a complete collection of Porter's songs (of course more than one album is required). My only negative comment is that I prefer the arrangements on more modern releases, such as Rod Stewart's ""Great American Songbook"" series (4 CD's), or Carly Simon's ""Moonlight Serenade"" disk."
3,Not nearly as good as Vol. 1,"I love Ella Fitzgerald, so any of her albums are great, but for some reason this just doesn't have the same magic as Vol. 1 in this series. That is one of my favorite CDs, so I thought this one would be as good. She is always amazing, and the better songs on this album are 'Night and Day', 'So In Love', 'I've Got you Under My Skin', and 'Don't Fence Me In.' The last is probably my favorite. For an Ella fan, it's worth buying. But buy 'Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook Vol. 1' first."
4,The COM become shistory,I have no problem on purchasing this book when I needed four years ago... But who care COM now? I ready once and forgot forever... to ease my life.
4,Good COM book for COM-ignorant programmer,"I've graduated about 9 years ago. While in college I was programming on PC using assembly language, C, Pascal on DOS. When I worked I move on to Unix , programming and doing computer animation. After years on Unix, I feel that programming on PC is somewhat alien. So many has changed and a lot has to be re-learned and unlearned. ""The Essence of COM"" has filled in the gap, good book for anyone who needs to catch-up with the technology quickly. The reason it does not get a 5 star is that at times the sentences need to be edited by an english teacher (of course he/she must understand COM first)."
3,Too pricey for the material,"Product is not bad. It has reinforced ribbing along the seams, which of course strengthens it a bit. But for $5+ it's too pricey. I had expected a thicker plastic and it is thoroughly see-thru. But for travel, especially for airport security, it's perfect and functional. I can't say I would buy this again. I'm sure I could find one elsewhere for lesser price."
5,Very Good Book!!!,This Book has helped me get better at chess in so many ways! I cant beleive it. BUY THIS BOOK!!! its worth it.
5,She's great.,I fell in love with this artist when I happened to see her on a PBS show some time ago. She is so much fun--full of energy and a style that demands one get out on the floor and dance.
5,A Really Great German Cookbook with Traditional Recipes!,"Born in Germany, I am VERY familier with German cooking and the iconic name, Dr. Oetker. This is probably the very best cookbook out there with all the traditional German recipes. Easy to understand and easy to follow, the recipes give clear step-by-step instructions. If you want a great German cookbook, this is it! ""Das Buch ist fantastisch!"""
3,"German Coo0king Todfay, the Original, by Dr Oetker","This book claims to be the original. I have to argue that fact. When I left Germany in 1967, my German mother-in-law gaveme a copy of Dr Oetker's book printed about 1966, suposedly first English version . This book lacks many of the recipes the other had that I reemember. Number one being the cheesecake recipe. However, it is not a bad book for one who has never been to Germany andhas had little exposure to German cooking."
2,Doesn't work,I've tried this for multiple things and it hasn't worked for anything. My computer won't even acknowledge it regardless of what I try to connect it to.
3,USB Cable,Good for USB extension and probably not much use for anything else. Its just a USB cable not much else to say.
1,Couldn't get it to Work,"I bought this cable and a different brand (white) cable on Amazon and the black cable - this one- will not work on any device I try to use it with - WD TV Mini or any of my USB 2.5"" or 3.5"" external drives connected to my laptop or my desk top computers. Not sure why. The white cable works fine. The drives barely light up and just click so I'm guessing there is too much resistance in this cable."
2,Stopped Working,"I purchased this to replace a broken male/male USB cable that connects the fan in my lap desk to my computer.The first and second time I used this cord, it worked perfectly. The third and any subsequent times it hasn't worked at all. At least it was cheap!"
5,Perfect!,I had a cooling pad for which I lost the USB to USB cable. This one perfectly replaced and my cooling pad was up and running. The item arrived on time.
4,Useful Backup,"I've been going to local sores trying to find a back up A to A cable and it was a pain to find. It works on the device that I need it for. It seems thinner than the A to A cable that came with my device, but I intend to use this only if I loose my primary cable."
5,Works!,"I made a mistake when ordering this (my bad, no one else at fault) - its Male to Male and needed male to female USB cable. I had to purchase and adapter to correct it - but the cable works as expected, Great buy!"
1,Did not work for purpose intended,This item did not work for the purpose intended. I wanted a cord to connect my laptop to my Smart TV. The TV did not recognize that there was hardware connected when this cord was attached.
3,ok,The product itself was ok but I had CANCELED the order an hour after I purchased and send an e-mail Received it anyway NEED TO READ YOUR E-MAILS ON CANCELATIONS
3,Took a long time,The item is fine---It's a cable---It took a very long time to arrive. What I needed it for was solved before the cable came....oh well.
5,"Super fast service, great price!","I got this cable because my monitor has a feature to upgrade the software but the input on the monitor is a female USB, same as on my computer so I needed a cable that was male on both ends. This was very inexpensive and delivered within a few days!"
3,"Not great, not Bad",I originally bought this to use with a USB switch for my printer till I found out it was the wrong one. So I cannot say how well it would hold up. But looking at the quality of the cable I would say it is so so. Would probably do the trick if you needed one in a fix.
1,Junk that I paid a little for...,"I think they offloading junk cables. Some of these reviews look like they are created by a business owner; not normal customers. Mine was crap and doesn't work an anything (PCs,TV... nothing). So, I got ripped off for about 4 or 5 bucks... but still sleazy."
3,That pretty much says it,"As long as the structural quality is ok, these things are pretty interchangeable. I was most impressed because I wanted them quickly. I ordered them one day and they arrived the next. I wouldn't have gotten them (I bought 2) any sooner if I had gone to a retail store."
5,cables,"cables were as advertised. worked perfect. Great deal, priced very economical. Would recommend these cables to anyone. Would buy again"
1,No not trust !,I bought the product and it has never arrived ! they take your money and no product ! Do NOT BUY
5,Great cheap USB,"Transfer speed is quick and its the perfect length, I was considering a shorted cable but I am glad I went with the 6-foot. Great price, I am surprised it was so cheap."
1,no help,I am unable to use this product as I intended. I hooked it up properly (for sure) and it was not able to provide signal from one device to another.
3,Can not use it to connect car MP3 player with SD card to computer,I buy it for connecting the car MP2 player with SD card to computer but it doesn't work. I try to directly plug the SD card to the slot of another computer and it worked. I don't know if this cable or else is wrong.
1,Worst Decesion,Please Do not buy this product.As this product i got it while back and i forgot to review.bt its not working.
4,Good Product,"Great pricing, is the reason why i made the purchase, mainly I was concern with a back up just in case durable,"
3,Product works well,Product works well - exactly as described. I would recommend it to anyone who needs this type of cable. end
5,Good product at an unbeatable price.,"Good product at an unbeatable price. I couldn't find a decent USB cable anywhere for a decent and reasonable price. Those thieves at RadioShack charge $30 for one, Best Buy same. That's a joke. So, i was happy I found this at Amazon."
3,Not what I wanted,I wanted a male to male USB cable to move pictures and files from my computer to my laptop and to my digital picture frame. Neither the computers or the digital picture frame recognized each other. I checked the cable contacts and they were all OK. After doing some research I find out that you need a special cable that includes software to do what I wanted. I do not blame the seller for my ignorance.
4,cable,"Got these to try to hook up computer to flat screen TV, but realized we needed a different type after we received them. Cost as much to return as we paid for them, so we have some extra cable now. Oh well."
4,great for the price and rarity,"ordered it to ""slave' my xbox to my tv screen and so far has sufficed for music and doing things not required by HD cables"
2,Was exactly what I ordered- But...,"The item arrived in perfect time and condition, unfortunately...I couldn't use it for what I intended.I wanted to use it to charge my labtop computer in my vehicle. I didn't realize my labtop battery wouldn't charge via usb cable.No one's fault but my own.Seller was not at fault."
3,old tech,needed some old tech usb cords and these filled the order. their getting hard to find these are 2.0 i mean how old can you get i was looking for 3.0' but all was worth it like i said these things are getting hard to find i bought 4
4,Cords work,Not much else I can say other than the cord works and it was the size that I ordered. Good purchase.
1,Crap,Dont waste your money on this Chinese piece of crap. This plastic crap doesn't even work. DO NOT BUY THIS!
3,Solid Cable,"Yup, it's an USB cable, not really much else to say or expect. Leave the ""gold connectors"" for those with too much money in their bank accounts."
5,a must!!!,"this product is a must for people who use computers a lot,sooner or later you will need to transfer imformation from on computer to another,this is the cable to do it with!!"
4,Ties are made to be adjustable,"Although most people don't need them, the ties are great for me, because I have high arches and wide feet."
2,Not really up to scratch,"Frankly, this one is a slight disappointment. I bought this one thinking it would be as good as Looking Good in Print by Roger Parker, but I found it to be shallow and the author to wander off track into non-design related areas."
5,Surviving the perils of working for large corporations,"Lights, Cubicle, Action!: 100+ Directives For Survival In Corporate America is a collection of sound tips and insights by A. A. Cantor into surviving the perils of working for large corporations. Each insightful revelation or sage piece of advice is enhanced with a brief, no-nonsense explanation. From ""Employees would rather read a blatant lie than hear incontrovertible truth.""; to ""Succeed at what you dislike and you will be forever condemned to it.""; to ""Success breeds success - but a great deal more contempt."", these memorable vignettes offer a true window of perception into the often twisted maze of office politics."
5,Gutsy,Gutsy bookCantor took a risk in telling the truth - this book uncovers much about corporate America that needs to be said. Many of his quotes are just plain funny but many are also designed to make you react. And just when you are getting irritated he has you just where he wants you. Buy the book.Jim
5,Wow.,"A lot of loose ends are tied up in this story. Then again, a few new ones were introduced.It's everything I've come to expect from Babylon 5."
5,Lost tales!,"I'm impressed by the author's ability to fill in many of the missing spaces left there by the television series. This book has revealed to me how life was for Sinclair after he left Babylon 5, and the process of how he got the title and position of Entil'Zha (or ""Ranger One""). We get to see more clearly the difference between the two worlon embassadors Kosh and Ulkesh, and get an idea about how this difference is going to manifest in the future of the series.I can recommend this book to every Babylon 5 fan, and have to admit that after I recieved it, it was a delight to sit down and just read it from the beginning until the end!"
4,The best of the series so far,"I just finished ""To Dream in the City of Sorrows"" last night, and I must say, I think that, of the nine books I've read in this series, this one is the best.I have to thank my friend Travis for introducing me to the TV series. I have been reading the novels, and have had reactions ranging from ""it was okay"" to ""yuck!""The biggest problem that I've had with the novels to date is that a lot of times, the characters act in ways that I find aren't consistent with their behaviors in the TV series. In this book, though, the characters behave as I'd expect them to.Plus, this book explains a lot of the back story stuff that I didn't quite understand from the series.A great read!"
2,"Nice, but...","This was good ""filler"" material for the time between Sinclair leaving the station and his assumption of his destiny. And it was nice to explain what happened to his girlfriend, even if that was not ultimately satisfying.But there was little that could not be guessed at, and the action seemed tacked on in some respects. There were some nice moments with Sinclair and his background, but the Mimbari moments seemed out of joint.As a big fan of the series, it was very nice reading. As someone hoping for more, it was barely satisfying reading."
3,"familiar characters, interesting backstory, but hamstrung by the Mimbari","The story is more entertaining in its first half, with three concurrent narratives of Catherine Sakai, Jeffrey Sinclair and Marcus Cole, told in alternating chapters. Catherine's and Marcus' solo exploits are the more interesting chapters. One wonders if the author felt a bit hamstrung with the Sinclair narrative of dull, planet-bound politics with the implacable and ritual-obsessed Mimbari, all within a time frame too well-circumscribed by events in the television series. Still, its a useful and informative side-story for fans of the SciFi show. Sinclair and Sakai's relationship is far more real and engaging, however brief a glimpse we get, then that of Sheridan and Delenn."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!,"I simply loved this book. I thought it was wonderful. For me, it really cleared up a lot of the Babylon 5 story for me. There were things I didn't know and this book gave me a great deal of backstory. I always wondered what the Rangers reasons for doing things were and now I know very clearly that it is their dedication to the preservation of life. I truly enjoyed reading this book and was very sad when I had finished it."
5,A Character-Driven Story,"This story fills in the gap of Jeffery Sinclair's life from the end of Season 1 to the middle of Season 3 of Babylon 5. If you're looking for action, go elsewhere. The story's focus is on how Sinclair's paradigm was altered, a change not explained on the show. The novel succeeds in doing what it was intended to, and leaves the reader wanting more, as good writing should. If you were intrigued by the Sinclair character or just want to fill in the gaps of the B5 story, this book is worth it. BUT BE WARNED! This book is a spoiler if you haven't seen the season 3 episodes ""WAR WITHOUT END"" parts 1&2. Great book, though."
1,The book is useless.,"I found this book very useless. It doesn't talk about GNOME internals, all it teaches you is what to expect from the icon when you click on it. I was very disappointed with this book."
2,Warning: Out of date,"This book, despite its size, is really just a presentation of Gnome. Many, many pages are taken up with descriptions of various programs that work under Gnome. It is nice to know what is out there, but I quickly needed more information than this book could provide.Most of all though, this book is very out of date."
3,I'm not a fan of this book,"I did not care for the transaltaion, nor did I care for the commentary--except in as much as it made me want to compare translations.I am an adult reader, and theater artist."
1,Antigone,I was extremely annoyed with the translation of this play. The description of the book should warn costumers of the EXTREMELY different translation!!!!!!!
4,Lovely read,"I read this book first many years ago and loved it. I must have lent it to someone who never returned it because I couldn't find it after offering to lend it to another friend. Glad to find it was still available. It arrived quickly, I can't wait to read it again. It is a really good book for understanding what life was like in the US, what influenced our parents and grandparents. The characters were well developed and the story line was gripping."
2,"OK, but Didn't Last Long","Bought two of these T-shirts and although they fit well, looked nice and were quite comfortable, they started getting holes in the underarm areas after about 5 washes."
5,Who is Angelina Esparza?,"Before buying this I did my homework to see how it rated against Krush's former work. There was an array of opinions but most seemed to agree that ""Alethuo"" was the defining peice. This is definitely the case. Although I enjoyed the mystic depth of tracks such as ""Trihedron"" and ""Lost Voices"", ""Alethuo"" (Truthspeaking) took it to the next level with the compliment of the words and voice of Ms. Esparza. The meaning of DJ Krush's title ""The Message at Depth"" is revealed."
3,Krush's weakest effort...,"I was at all not inpressed with the Message at the Depth. With 11 tracks in total, it's also one of the shortest Krush albums. Nothing really stands out. Its almost as if Krush tried to use Prefuse 73's formula but will little success. I did not feel it for the most part. There are hints of greatness throughout but not enough to save the album. This is not where you want to start your Krush collection. Go with Millight or Meiso.Standout tracks: Blackhole, D'you Hear That (too short), The Lost Voices and But the World Moves On.The remaining songs are average, with some being mediocre."
2,Lazy Production,"Dj Krush is great, anticon is great, but this album is just boring. Every song sounds pretty much the same, the vocal tracks by the members of anticon are drowned out and the song done with Angelina Esparza, is less than so-so. It sounds like Dj Krush was given 10 sounds and was told to make an album using only those 10 sounds and 1 tempo. Again, I would reccomend any other Dj Krush album, and suggest that you check out anticon if you haven't already because they are splendid, but this album was weak."
3,Mixed,"Some of the tracks on this album are really inovative and strong - however, there are a number of weak, popcorn-sounding pieces that just don't work for me."
3,Skippable,"I bought the vinyl. I also own Ki-Oku, Zen and Krush, all of which I would not part with, and this one stood out as just an average house music album. I think DJK's strongest efforts are realized more on Krush and Zen where there's more substance, more hip-hop, which I'd like to think of as contrasting elements put together in a workable relationship. I love Ki-Oku, but I think it doesn't really challenge the formal elements of sound as deeply as the artist is able to, there's not enough work with contrasting sound elements to hold it together as triumphantly as on Zen or Krush. Message at the Depth fails to offer anything new or interesting--though perhaps it has some value to other DJs, I wouldn't play it at a party. ""Well, time to go shave my neck. This has been Zebraneck, coming to you straight from the north pole."""
3,Did Skid Row get back together? this is some great 80's metal all the way!,"When I first listened to this disc, I honestly thought this was a new Skid Row record! The singer sounds a lot like Sebastian Bach at times. That isn't a bad thing at all!This is a great time to be an 80's metalhead. Good, pure metal is making a comeback (thanks to the Showdown, 3 Inches of Blood, Hammerfall, Dream Evil and the like) This disc has great guitar work, lots of double bass drum and a very clear sound.The only thing I don't like is all the profanity. I understand angst and emotion, and can understand when sometimes a profanity just expresses everything you need to say. But these guys throw F bombs around carelessly and makes them sound stupid and illiterate.If they could write some smart lyrics to go with this awesome metal music, I'd have given them a 5 star review, no problem!!"
1,Uninspiring...,"I had the displeasure of seeing this band open for MegaDeth last night. All I can say is GROAN!!! There is nothing new about this band, except for thier really spiffy Emo haircuts. They are basically nothing more than another pre-packaged Boi-Band, nothing more than N'SYNC who plays exremely weak and predictable punk-metal drivle. I predict all of these guys will be gobbling goo in ""All Male Adult Films"" (wink-wink) in 5 years. I know elementary school kids with more original material..."
3,Good cable for the money,"Needed an USB extension cable and this one worked well. As a matter o fact, it's still in use on one of my son's computers today."
4,"Good battery, fast shipping","This is a good battery, and it got here really fast. The charge doesn't last as long as I would like, lasting about 2-3 days with moderate use, and it takes a while to charge fully, but it is a good price..."
3,Okay: Short reads well organized,The book builds on one section to the next. Short and sweet. Gets to the point rather well and not a long drawn out experience
1,Poor manufacturing makes for a lousy toy.,This building set is a poor quality knock off of the Lincoln Log brand. It is poorly machined and the pieces do not fit together. Pieces are irregular in shape and quality. I am returning the set we bought.
1,Horrible DVD transfer,"Its in a 4:3 letterbox format, and is just a horrible transfer.Please update this wonderful movie with a better DVD/BluRay disk."
5,Oldie but a Goldie,"Although the Abyss is 11 years old it is still one of the classics. Sound and picture are as pure as a diamond. Watch the special edition and see the film in a new light, the 28 extra minutes tells another story, so find out what really happened when Ed Harris went to the bottom of the sea. Connect the DVD player to a Dolby Digital 5.1 Decoder and this film really comes alive. Edge of the seat action that will make you Jump, Scream, and Cry. Great acting and superb special effects from the master of cinematography "" James Cameron "" and the sound quality that can only be made with the best..THX. Films of today are still trying to match the quality of this film but are still way behind in every way. 10/10"
5,Great DVD--Cameron at his best,"This DVD is an excellent example of the superiority of the DVD format. There is so much information on this DVD, any Abyss fan can become an expert on every aspect, from the making of the movie to the script rewrites. This James Cameron masterpeice is shown in it's entirety, yet the theater cut is also included. There is such an incredible amount of information on this DVD, one is overwhelmed! This is a great gift for anyone just starting a DVD collection, or looking for a great classic."
5,Another original,James Cameron - Here's a director that never has disappointed me. One particular part that makes this movie a must-have - I'd never seen anything so intense! Great Movie!
5,An Ocean Of Delight,"I positively love this movie, perhaps because of the love story that runs through it, perhaps because of the notes of hope and sacrifice. Sure, some of the SEALs plotline is a bit tedious, but I don't care -- there are so many moments that are breathtaking. I am nowhere near as impressed by Cameron's TITANIC or even TERMINATOR 2 as with this film.The extras are well worth the investment, too, with behind the scenes pieces, documentaries, easter eggs galore. Picture quality is close to excellent, sound quality is superb, and the seamless branching works smoothly on both my Toshiba SD1200 and my Creative Encore player."
2,The Abyss That Missed,The movie took way too long to get to anything half-way exciting. It could have been cut down to 30 minutes!
3,The Ending??????,I really enjoyed this movie until the last five minutes. I don't understand how Cameron could be so effective with his special effects for the first two hours and then regress to B movie special effects at the end.
3,"Good, but the LD is still better","My problem with the DVD is the color correction on a lot of scenes seems off. The supplements are astounding, though. One question remains: Why did they skip the anamorphic transfer on this one?"
3,"Poor definition and grainy not suitable for 60"" tv","I was disapointed in how poor the definition was on this ""special edition"". the scan lines were often clearly visible and distracting when people were talking or when displaying graphics like the text sent on the deep dive.If you have a large TV even with a good DVD player that upscales well, it will make for poor viewing. Too bad because this was a spectacular special effects movie."
4,"Incredible movie, fantastic Special Effects, Excellent Story","This was and is an excellent movie. The special effects are absolutely fantastic. Several plot lines weave together to make this movie riveting, surprising, and fast paced. Its only drawback is the length, it is over 3 hours. If you have the time then spend it on this movie, it is just well worth the investment."
3,Some spectacular scenes but could have been better.,"The Abyss has some truly spectacular scenes,but there is one badly written big scene that goes ""clunk"" and hurts the film.That scene is when the woman drowns,cannot be revived and then suddenly comes back to life.Not only that,but this women that has been dead is a short time later up and walking around as if nothing happened.This resulted in the scene involving the diver descending to the bomb getting snickers from the audience.It was absurd that this woman that was dead can so soon be whispering sweet nothings into the divers ear.And the spaceship goes to the surface and causes ships to turn on their sides.What now?If it dives the ships will sink! James Cameron should leave the writing to real writers."
3,So-so underwater sci-fi and did anyone catch the quick tribute to 10cc?,"A tribute to 10cc's song ""I'm Not in Love"" is made at the climax of the film as Mery Elizabeth Mastrantonio quotes to dying Ed Harris the ""Big Boys don't cry"" line, soon followed by the word 10cc.Not bad deep water sci-fi. Good performances all around and impressive special effects. The dialogue and word play gets a bit too hammy and the ending is way over the top, which kind of spoils an otherwise good lead up to the climatic finish.Could be considered an underwater ""Twister"" sort of movie. Heavy on effects, that takes plenty of liberty with reality. And relies much more on fiction even though it's portrayed mostly as science.Recommended as a popcorn movie, but don't expect groundbreaking, thought provoking cinema."
2,Not the best DVD edition,"I love this movie. It's hard to think of a better masterpiece from the 1980s. It's just too bad I bought this version -- older DVDs like this one have some problems with playback on modern widescreen TVs. Without using the TV's ""zoom"" feature (which basically makes the image larger to fit the screen, but reduces resolution drastically), you have to watch the movie in a truncated box within the screen. There is no true 16:9 output from the disc itself.It is indeed presented in ""widescreen"" format, but the movie plays in a 4:3 setting which shrinks the image to fit within 4:3-sized box in your 16:9 monitor. Not the best way to watch a great movie. I'll have to wait for a Blu-Ray version when I finally upgrade to hi-def.That aside, the extended version of the film is included along with the standard version. But there are almost no special features at all."
5,Great movie!,"This is one of my all-time favs! Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star in it and it is directed by James Cameron. It is a story of a civilian oil rig crew who is recruited for a search-and-rescue mission. A diver (Harris) finds himself on something like an underwater odyssey 25,000 ft. below the ocean's surface. It is a real thriller, it takes you to the deepest depths and then raises you up to a high level of elation as the two who were once husband and wife find a mysterious power that has the power to change the world for good or for evil and in the process rekindle their love for one another. Wonderful movie, wonderful feeling after having watched it!"
4,The Abyss,I originally saw The Abyss (In its shortened version) in a theater. The extended directors cut takes the movie to a different level. It is one of the most unique movies ever made. Cameron is a great film maker. On the dvd you have a chance to see both versions. A must for sight and sound.
1,NON-anamorphic picture,"So disappointing! I thought this would FINALLY be the anamorphic dvd we've been waiting for, but... NO! Strange that so many ""different"" versions of this film have been released on dvd without the anamorphic addition. A HUGE amount of dvd buyers now own hd tv's and home theater projectors... the anamorphic aspect of a dvd is of significant importance to us!! I love this movie... what a total shame."
1,Unbelievable!,"Dazed and confused!!!!! I feel like I am in the Abyss!!!!! What happened to the Anamorphic? The box cover even states anamorphic? What is Fox up to? I was so excited that all of the advertising for this edition stated anamorphic, but I was left so violated when I discovered that I had yet spent more money for the same version that I had on the 5 star edition. Fox please have someone check this stuff before you fool the public!"
1,GREAT MOVIE! 5 Stars! DVD 0 Stars!,"Great Story! 5 StarsGreat Actors! 5 StarsGreat Director! 5 StarsGreat Sci-Fi Movie! 5 StarsGreat on DVD? NO, NO, NO!!! Zero Stars!!! Non-Anamorphic, Non-16x9 Widescreen, Very Poor Video Transfer onto DVD, and Not on Blu-Ray yet? What the #$%*! We are living in an age of HD 16x9 TV's and this, one of the great emotionally moving Sci-Fi movies of our time is placed on DVD that is formatted for a 4x3 Standard Definition TV's? You have got to be kidding me.Hey James Cameron and Paramount or whoever is involved in the process of bringing this great movie to DVD, WE WANT THIS MOVIE IN 16x9 HD Format OR if you won't do that, how about a regular DVD in 16x9 Format/Anamorphic and why don't you throw in a remastered video transfer while you're at it so WE CAN ALL enjoy this movie on our 16x9 Widescreen Plasma, LCD, and LED TV's and Projectors!!!What a shame."
2,False Advertising,"The Abyss single disc edition is a cool movie, but the actual movie is not in Dolby 5.0 as Amazon.com or Dolby 5.1 as the DVD jacket would have us believe, but only in Dolby 2.0 (2 channel) English or French. I tried both the theatrical and the special edition cut, same result.Buyer beware."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed that the Video On Demand version is not in wide screen format but rather in 4:3.
1,A Total Waste Of Money,"Before I even begin, I'd like to say that my one star rating is directed solely at the DVD itself-ANY VERSION, I've bought them all - NOT THE MOVIE! None of them!!!NOT ONE! is in anamophic (Enhanced) widescreen!!!! This movie is probably - who am I kidding? - is most defintely - THE BEST sci-fi movie ever made! It deserves a hell of a lot more than 5 measily stars! I give it 10, personally. All DVD incarnations of it, however, get absolutely NO stars from me. I can't, without being absolutely vulgar, express how unhappy I am with 20th Century Fox. They've sucked over $150.00 out of me - just trying to find a decent copy of this movie. I really wouldn't mind - $150.00 ain't much money - but I'm disabled and am trying to survive on about $700.00 a month! Get with the program fellas! Let me see it in true widescreen at least once before I die!"
5,The Abyss Special Edition DVD,This DVD is a must have if you're just starting out or already have a substantial collection. The special features alone are incredible! Add to that two versions of an outstanding movie on a two disc set and you get one of the most entertaining DVD's ever. You gotta get this one!
4,Great underwater action movie,"I love Cameron's movies. This one doesn't disappoint. Its about Linsday,her soon to be ex husband Bud(Ed Harris)and their crew of oil riggers on Deepcore 2,who run into trouble when a group of Navy SEALS come on board when a submarine named the Montana sinks with some important material on board.Beautifully photographed movie that is not to be missed."
4,"Already great story, turned greater!!","Every submarine and undersea movie lovers will like this one!I got the first edition of the movie and I loved it! I've seen this edition and it explained everything I didn't understand from the first release. Most of Cameron's movies are great... Watch'em all...If you like the James Cameron type of movie, you'll love this one!"
3,"Good movie, AWFUL DVD!","This DVD is awful. First of all, it's widescreen (2.35:1) but NOT ANAMORPHIC!!? Really, I expect more from a THX master! Secondly, the ""directors cut"" is just stupid. He added another 10 minutes of CRAP onto the end of the movie that totally changes the entire meaning of the film. WHY??? Really, when you see it you will LAUGH out loud, it is so implausible and inanely stupid! The original version is SO much better, you can tell pretty easily WHY they cut that last bit of crap off.. it's a much better film without it."
3,Don't bother with this version,"The Abyss is a great movie and I definitely recommend checking it out. However if you are going to get it you might as well get the Special Edition or the Double Digipack versions of the DVD. This one just has the theatrical release of the movie. That's all. You don't get both versions of the film, including the extended version with 20+ minutes of additional footage (well worth sitting through) nor the incredibly compelling documentaries and extras that are truly worth having.Considering the low price of the Special Edition there is absolutely no reason why you should go for this non-extras, non-extented edition format. Do yourself a favor and trade up."
4,James Cameron once again proves himself a master . . .,"Long before he sank the Titanic, James Cameron proved himself a master story-teller with his underwater adventure The Abyss. Like most James Cameron flicks, it has everything--special effects before its time, thrilling action sequences, speculative technology, and a touching love story. I don't know how Mr. Cameron does it, but I love almost every movie he's made. And you have not seen this movie until you've seen the Special Edition. It explains so much, such as the aliens' motivation.As a bonus, the DVD comes with a lot of nifty extras, as every great Special Edition DVD should.My only problem with it is a minor one--I don't know if I bought a defective copy, but the 5.0 Surround doesn't work when I watch the Special Edition--just the theatrical version.That's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, it's a visually and emotionally stunning movie, and a cool DVD."
1,Worst quality DVD,"First let me say that I absolutely love this film. A classic alien encounter movie with suspense, action, and even a love story. Now why the 1 star? The video and audio quality is like watching it on a 1980's TV...The special edition has a few more minutes of alien injection and some lame political statements. Keep the original or theatrical edition and don't buy this expecting quality of any sort."
4,They had me till the end,"The first time i saw this I walked out thinking, ""what a stupid ending!"" But I saw it again, and remember that i was loving this movie right up to the end. I just didn't like the end. So, we'll say here that for the first 80% it is a 5 star movie, giving it 4 stars.Hey, maybe you'll like the ending better than we did in the household far far away."
2,"""The Abyss""","I thought the movie was way too long and pretty cheesy. There were some good things about it - and I don't know how ppl who watch it without the added footage completely understand the end (all the TV news footage) - but I didn't like the movie much. I saw this video with a bunch of friends at one of our friend's place, so it was fun to get the reaction of everybody and stuff. Some liked it, some didn't. I thought there were some really cheesy parts which didn't even seem they should be there. It's an interesting movie to watch, if you have the time and really want to see it, but get comfy, you're going to be watching this movie for a LOOOONNGG time. (It's way too long!)"
1,The title says it all.,"Truly abysmal. Yes, the special effects are tremendous, but the moronic screenplay is hard to get past. Is this film what took Mastrontonio and Biehn off the A-list? They're directed to play ideas, not people. Biehn, otherwise a competent actor, twitches and rolls his eyes here, indulging in every acting cliche. Poor Mastrontonio, usually brilliant, here goes from cynical realist to alien-spotter in one fell swoop. Come on. Anyone else in her position would assume that she has discovered a previously unknown sea creature before deciding it's an alien. There are unbelievable jumps in the story; it's just a mess. Only Ed Harris escapes unscathed. I'd rather see an Esther Williams water picture than this mess again."
3,A Boring Plunge Into The Deep,"Can't see the big deal about this movie. Although the story and special effects are somewhat creative, the acting and film is just plain boring and dull.A lot of shouting matches and action yelling without much significant dialogue. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's spousal spasms were just plain irritating. The best acting was by Michael Biehn who played the paranoid Navy SEAL. The movie takes too long to get to the point and there isn't much going on in between those long plot lags except those annoying shouting matches between Ed and Mary: one can watch Jerry Springer free for that.A nice try by Cameron but certainly not one of his best works. Worth renting if you have nothing else to watch and you have a lot of time on your hands."
2,SAD ENDING...,"I have only the VHS, and I must say the end ruined this movie, which was following so tight,well crafted and with good actin (although I think Mastrantonio ia a very bad actress). Anyway, I'll seek a DVD edition for myself, to understand what the reviewers below are talking about. To say this movie is better than ""TERMINATOR - JUDGEMENT DAY"" is a kind of heresy, but , well, who knows...?"
3,Glad they deleted these scenes,"The Abyss is one of my all time favorite films. I don't know what everyone is talking about when they say it is slow paced. I got the VHS tape many years ago and that thing is worn out.One day I saw the DVD special edition ""uncut"" version and was baffled. The plot is needlessly expanded - it gives a COMPLETELY different flavor to the movie. I will not go into detail, but it is very deliberate and quite goofy. I regretted ever seeing the special edition and I'm trying to forget it. James was smart to cut what he did.I highly recommend the non-special edition, but not this."
1,The ABYSS - A real LOSER!,"You know and I know this movie is so boring it will leave you with nothing! One of the worst! Truthfully, this motion picture is an absolute waste of time.... Dosen't deserve a one star, except for special effects. Almost ruined Mary's career."
2,Could have been better,"How can a woman that has drowned and been revived get up and walk around a short time later? No wonder the ausience sniggered at the cinema where I saw this movie. It has some big and impressive scenes and great music.What a pity the story wasn't properly thought out a bit more.The end is an anti-climax and makes no sense.OK.the aliens have gone to the surface and ships lay on their side.What now?If it goes back down then those ships will sink! James Cameron,leave the writing to the writers please."
2,Broken when I got it.,"When I received this the black cover that goes over the exposed tape was in 3 pieces, maybe just need to find out a different was to ship more safely."
3,Be forewarned....!,"First off I love this movie, and this DVD set is excellent. This is not the reason for the 3 star rating, this is more of a rating of the DVD itself, and not the content. I purchased this DVD thinking it was an anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 or widescreen TVs). IT IS NOT! I repeat, it is NOT an anamorphic transfer. If you are a serious DVD collector this should get your dander up. And those people who are casually collecting...as soon as you buy a TV that has 16x9 mode, this disc will not look any better. I am angry that the studio and Cameron allowed this to happen. Especially Cameron that is so touchy about the ""craft"" of making movies. He should be throwing a fit that this DVD is non-anamorphic like I was when I put it in my player! Now the studio is gonna put out yet ANOTHER version that will be enhanced for widescreen TVs, and I'm tired of playing that game."
3,Need the Anamorphic version to see true Abyss,"This is a great film, however, being the owner of a widescreen television, it's a shame the DVD sharpness is lost.I brought the DVD assuming it would be ""formated for widescreen tv"" (it does says exactly that on the bottom of the DVD box. Yet it is not really anamorphic. For those of you who don't know what anamorphic means, you will once you invest some money on a widescreen television. Trust me...it's worth waiting for an anamorphic DVD version. Any movie I buy must say anamorphic(or made for 16x9 televisions). If you don't have a 16x9 tv yet, but plan to buy one in the next few years, I recommend you start building your DVD collection with only anamorphic enhanced DVD's.I'm so upset that I can't maximize my Abyss DVD. I'm even more upset they still haven't come out with the anamorphic version. The Abyss movie is so good I refuse to watch it at a lesser quality."
1,NON-ANAMORPHIC?!,"The Abyss (Special Edition)is not the set that a proper cinephile would appreciate.I was so excited that this DVD was on sale at Best Buy for $9.99 that I immediately bought it. I put it in to play on my widescreen TV to find out that Fox did not set this DVD up to be played on HDTVs! I have to set the picture in a 4:3 image to watch a film that is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.This set is utterly disappointing! I would recommend that everyone wait for this to be released on BluRay. Only then will Fox actually make good on their ""special edition"" promise. At least, I hope they will..."
1,If only I had read these posts...,"Bought this believing it would be recorded correctly. They just took the 2003 non-anamorphic DVD and put a cardboard with a hologram on top that says 2007, that's all. Once opened, you cannot return these. I'll throw it away I guess... is there a phone number to complain? Can't find one..."
2,Wrong format - screen,"Again, this movie is on the wrong format. Theback cover show widescreen, but not. Still it is 4:3.A great movie, but todays standards are not acceptable.Do not buy it, until ""another"" new edition will come with true 16:9."
4,Special Edition adds extra sub-plot,"I've always known this film in the original theatrical version, which is well over 2 hours long. The Special Edition adds another 24 minutes of footage and adds an extra environmental sub-plot. I'm not entirely convinced by the longer version, which ends up being a little preachy, but it does add some extra interest and alien interaction. However, the original theatrical version is also included on the same DVD, with the classic solid-water tentacle effect, and deep-sea mini-sub battles, plus the superb performances of Ed Harris and especially Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who really should have appeared in more films."
4,Underwater Thrills!,"While this under-water epic concentrates more on the action/suspense sequences it does have some nice sci/fi plot elements. A technical marvel with breathtaking visual effects and sound. The action sequences are intense and very well done, what else can you expect from James Cameron, one of the best action directors of our times. The story is great and so is the acting. The fantasy and sci/fi elements are fascinating but are put beside to concentrate on the suspense. Great special effects and suspense make this one definitely worthwhile. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"
5,Best of the Best,"This movie is spectacular. Great story, great acting, and great special effects. This movie has some of the most powerful scenes I can think of. The scene of Bud (Ed Harris) and his wife trying to decide who gets the helmet for air while the submarine fills with water is incredible. Just as incredible is, what I believe to be the climax, when Bud descends down into the abyss. This is perfect filmmaking in my eyes. Not to mention that this DVD has more extra features than anyone would ever need, including an incredible documentary. I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone that came a-knockin'."
5,A MUST have for your DVD collection!,This is a great movie. I'd already owned it as VHS and have been purchasing all my old favorites in DVD...and this was one I had to have.Plenty of action....suspense and excitement. It really is one you'll enjoy time and time again.
3,A little dull but ok.,I first saw this movie when I was a kid. It wasn't as good as I hoped for. it really is hard to remember all the movies ive seen over the years. I guess all I can say is that the movies ok if you want to kill some time. And I never tell What the movie is all about. I let you guys find That out for yourselves. But I do my best to tell how good the movie was. And this one gets three stars.
1,Not for this century!,After reviewing the encouraging reviews I decided to buy the movie and see it for the first time. To tell you the truth I was not impressed at all. This movie might have been something extra ordinary back in the 80s but if you see it now for the first time you'll be very much disappointed!
1,Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED,This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover. this is the first and only version of the movie. Get the 5 star collection.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator is DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
5,All DVD's Should Be This Good,"""The Abyss-Special Edition"" shows off the capabilities of DVD. There are over 3 hours of extra features including two ""Making Of"" documentaries. The best feature of this disc however is that you have the option to watch either the theatrical version of the film or the 171 minute director's cut, both on the same disc. I can only hope that when other studios bring out movies on DVD they can put a much time and effort in to their DVD's as 20th Century Fox put in to this disc."
1,Infuriating --,"This is infuriating:There are how many -- a half dozen -- ""different"" editions of ""Abyss""? Several are single-disk, and several are double-disk.But no matter which of the many one looks at, one finds the exact same reviews on all of them: single-disk, double-disk -- no difference.So how is one to determine which will meet one's needs, thus which to buy, if there is no information provided that would help one do so?One fact is certain: until Amazon gets its act together -- keep the reviews for separate versions and ""editions"" separate -- there will be instances, as with this one, that I won't buy that which is immersed in a swamp of unnecessary confusion."
2,"""The Abyss"" Single Disc Edition--Misleading Advertising !!!",Just want to make you all aware that the single disc edition for the DVD THE ABYSS has misleading sound options.The back of the disc jacket states that English 5.1 sound is available.When you engage the menus only English or French surround sound are available.I blew my stack when I noticed this and now I am stuck with an inferior product.
1,Squished Picture Too,"First off, I love the movie, and I would normally give it 4 out of 5 stars. The problem I am having is that the picture appears as if it were on a standard 4:3 television. I have a widescreen TV, and the image is ""squished"" with double black bars. I set my DVD player for a widescreen display, and the aspect ratio is still wrong. I am having this problem with the two-disc DVD that came out some years ago now. Not the newly released two disc set with the white box. Another reviewer as reported the same problem.I don't know if they have remedied the problem with the newer DVD or not, but I would not recomend this version for owners of widescreen TV's. This mars an otherwise fantastic movie."
2,"Not as advertised, Missing 5.1 sound only 2 channel audio","This disc is not Anamorphic widescreen and it is missing DD 5.1 sound, it has only French 2 channel and English two channel sound.This disc , not the Movie is a major disappointment.I thought they were finally releasing this movie in an Anamorphic widescreen format."
2,Could do better,"Nice movie, great sound effects it was one of the first movies to succesfully use Dobly Digital. Sadly enough this NOT ""the directors cut"", and is missing some crucial parts of the movie. Because of this the movie is kinda boring.If you want to buy this movie, then skip this one and go straight to the directors cut. It also include's a nice documentary about movie which gives an nice inside view of the history of modern movie making."
5,Good movie!,"If you havn't seen The Abyss, go for it! This movie is such a treat plus with the extra long ending it really is neat. The only thing I didn't like was the ""Hidden Moral of the Day Kids!"" twards the end. I'm for saving the enviroment and human race etc.. but this was alittle hokey. ""Man kind is so evil, but you are hope!"" they don't say that but.. you will know what I mean."
4,"Movie 5, DVD 3","I love this movie. The DVD is lackluster. Glitchy in my computer, TEXT COMMENTARY? Wassamatter Cameron. Ashamed?"
3,Amiss with the Abyss,"The amount of work that went into this film merits a 5 star. There are lot's of features to look at and that helps. I did watch the part that has all the actors responding to the movie. It did make me appreciate their efforts. It was a good movie, but as the guy with the rat in the movie said, "" We went from underwater drama to E.T. "" The ending was pretty crummy. Most movies either live or die because of their endings. This ending crushed all their efforts. It is worth renting, but not a great movie."
2,A kind of ripoff as you don't get the full 4 hour version!,"For people who can get the full version on laser disk. It's really worth while! the VHS tape is a badly edited version of the full 4 hour fantastic film! IF you taped the TV version, the TV version is an even bigger ripoff!"
2,The Abyss is where my review will probably fall....,"People often describe a moment in a TV show or a movie where they gave up watching it, as a ""jump the shark moment"". This reference is taken from Fonzy's famous jump over the rubber shark. If I'm the only person in history who thought this movie jumped the shark, than so be it, but I believe it did. Jumped and landed right in the Abyss.For a crew that seems to be so knowledgeable on ""Deep Pressure Syndrome"" not to realize that the leader of the Seal team is not only suffering from it, but is on the verge of a nervous break down that will put them all in jeopardy, is just unforgivable. And to watch his team follow his every order so blindly knowing that his mentally capacity is completely gone makes them look ridiculous.Shark jumped..."
3,Abyss soars in picture but falls in sound,"The special edition of this movie does help explain some plot holes that seemed missing in original version. The digital transfer of the movie gives it a better and more real-life like feel of the underwater world. The aliens are more powerful than it was shown in original version. The submarine was brought down on purpose not accidentally probed. This movie though tediously slow-paced would have gotten a five star if not for the sound. The sound is subdued and even the score which sounded great 10 years ago feels underperformed in this movie. NOW, I know why the Abyss may be in Dolby Digital sound but it is NOT 5.1 discrete. It is in at best 5.0 which is a combination of Digital surround and pro-logic front. MY PROGIC LOGIC DISPLAY BUTTON is on at all times throughout the movie. Think about it how else could he put two versions of a 2+ hour movie on the same disc. Lastly, that is some cool tidal wave at the end."
5,One of the best movies ever made,"This has to be one the best movie ever made. The characters are likeably, it has a good story, good action, and a love story. Overall this is a great movie that everyone should own."
5,Get this DVD,I was very impressed. Even has some hidden things. I would recommend this DVD to anyone.
5,Peaches,"Because I grew up with peach juice dribbling down my chin, I've been longing for that sensation for years! With mouth-watering anticipation, I read this book hungrily as I prepared for our Book Club discussion next week."
1,The first song is truncated,"""Opinion # 33"" is really a 5 minute 5 second long song. The 3:24 song that Amazon has is truncated. Amazon should fix this."
1,Should be SPICY HOT instead of Spicy World,"This is really spicy hot stuff, had to rinse meat after using. NEVER HAD CHILI POWDER THIS HOT BEFORE!!!!!!! CAUTION"
4,Helps give a sense of NRBQ live,"I've never seen NRBQ live, but this albume makes me feel like I have, and that they impressed me. These songs are full of feeling and make me want to dance. I love the cover of ""Sitting in the Park."""
5,great informational book on Angels,"nice spiritual book about Angels and their purpose. I really like it and wish it was in audio because I hate reading. I lack the patience. It is well worth the money and if you are a Child of God or in the ministry as a child of God, it would help you with your angelic knowledge. It will give you understanding how things work in the spiritualrim. Great book!"
4,Wonderful information from renowned Bible Scholar,"I have really enjoyed reading Angels. It is very informative. For example, I didn't realize there were more biblical references to angels throughout the Bible than to Satan, yet we think often of Satan more than the angels who are before us to watch over us. I think anyone interested in angels would be well served to read this Biblically-based reading for more information. The reason for 4 stars is that while I enjoy the wealth of information B Graham gives, I think his writing style suits more of a 'study-approach' to reading the book...rather than a 'curl up on the couch' kind of read. I think, though, that the information in this book is worth the effort. I would suggest anyone interested in studying angels to get their Bibles out and actually reference the scriptures he mentions. Make notes and decide for yourself if angels really exist."
4,A good buy,My mother suggested this book and I've found it to be easy to understand and comforting to know their among us.
5,"very good book,with a great explanation about angels and God.",This book was an excellent selection and talks a great deal about angels .And gives you alot of knowledge that Angels exist and there duties.After losing my 11yr son in a car accident when a drunk driver hit us .I wondered about Angels and if they really existed.God loves us and sends them as protection.
5,Highly Recommended!,"If you are a Bible believing Christian you will love this book! If you do not know God, you will come to believe in what He is capable of. I had chills before I got to page 8. Wonderfully written by a true man of God whose word is trustworthy. Awesome inspiring stories make it hard to put down."
4,Extraordinary,"To be perfectly honest, I didn't know much about Billy Graham before reading this book. I didn't know how well I'd like what he had to say nor how Biblically sound his teaching would be. That said, I have been wonderfully blessed by this book. I have learned much and would definitely recommend it! It isn't a book that kept me on the edge of my seat, but it explains so much that I find myself going back to it time and again."
2,Power Jacked,"I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006. I bought a laptopp on the cheap end, knowing that it would either break or be outdated in a couple of years, and here I am, just as predicted.I have to call Kenmore, now. My two year old refrigerator just stop refrigerating. Ah, the age of great quality and service! (Yes, Mr. Steve. I am sorry to here about your broken equipment, Mr. Steve. I'm sorry, but it seems I can not help you. Please hold.)"
2,Good as long as it lasts,This laptop was really nice for the first two years that I owned it - then the power stopped connecting properly. I tried to have it repaired but it just went from bad to worse (using a port replicator as a power source didn't work at all either). So now I can't turn on my computer at all. HP told me they could replace the entire motherboard to fix the problem - for $1000. I don't think so!
3,An alternative to the normal blood and gores game.........,"I would give this game a 3. First of all, it gets a little boring because it's repetative and all you really do is deliever papers to the customer. But I really liked this game because it is like the original Paperboy. It also isn't bloody and gorey like many of the new video games. I would recommed this game to people who have played Paperboy before becasue they know what to expect and won't be disapointed when it's not fast paced and action filled. Paperboy is not for anyone under 8 because it might be a little to hard and take to much concentration. They also might find it boring. So if you like the original Paperboy, this is the game for you!"
2,Reviews for Paperboy,I was really disapointed in this game. It is quite boring. I bought it about three weeks ago and I really wish I hadn't got it. It does have some fun parts hawever but they don't occur very often. Overall I don't recommend this game.
1,This game stinks,My parents got me this game as a birthday presant. I liked it for about 30 minutes but then it got boring. The game is basically the same thing repeated over and over again. It was not worth the money. I don't like this game very much because it is too boring. I don't recommend this game.
3,Dullsville!,This is a game that is boring for a hardcore gamer. If you buy it buy it for small kids.
1,booooo!,wow this has got to be the worst game i have ever played. I mean really who wants to go around and deliver papers for a video game when they could be on quests to save the world. instead of quests to get a good tip.
4,kick-ass beat and sweet--sweet vocals,"Incognito really grooves. The way they construct the bass lines and beat really gets you shaking. Sometimes however, the groove gets to monotonous and produced. Layered with a little too sweet lyrics, it might turn some people off who are looking for purer funk. It doesn't bother me, but essentially I am in it for the feel of the rythm section. It's really tight. An even though the nature of the lyrics are on the sweet side, the singers execute really well, and it's fun listening to."
2,Radio ratios,"2 1/2This quite abruptly moves between engaging fused funk reminiscent of Jamiroquai, and schmaltzy light jazz reminiscent of your local waiting room, unfortunately focusing a majority on the latter in vein crossover attempts when it is apparent where the talent lies. The clue as for which tracks to avoid? Pretty much anything with vocals-Mcdonalds theme and scats notwithstanding."
4,excellent,"Incognito play very slick, melodic jazz funk.'This music has a digital sheen, but underneath are some fantastic vocals, and the instrumental work is also excellent. If you are old school like me, it takes a while to get used to funk without that perfect grit of imperfection, but once done, you'll admire the melodic abilities, vocal work and playing of these ace players.Into modern acid jazz grooves and it is no contest. Either way, get it."
5,positivity,"We must don't forget that Incognito lead the way of a musical genre that combines elements of soul music, funk, disco, and another moods, beats and sounds. The compositions often feature chord structures usually associated with Jazz music and good music, but this time we have a album with a difference - real soul and beautiful compositions. Is it new? I think is a masterpiece, in especial way - Still a friend of mine - unique."
4,Positivity - 4.5 stars,"I just pulled this favorite out and listened for the first time in a while. Although released in 1993, the music is truly TIMELESS and sounds as fresh as if it were released yesterday. This is my favorite Incognito album featuring excellent music production, the British acid-jazz sound and with more than a few stellar lead vocal performances by Maysa Leak.My favorite tracks: DEEP WATERS, STILL A FRIEND OF MINE, DO RIGHT, STEP INTO MY LIFE, SMILING FACES & PIECES OF A DREAM."
4,"Mainly terrific songs. Unique combo of soul/jazz/""funk""","This is a great CD to give as a gift, because it's very ""likeable"" without being too generic. From the first song (Step into My Life), which has a great soft-sorta funky beat, to Deep Water, which is sorta sultry, this CD has something for everybody. A very ""sophisticated"" CD to add to your collection."
5,humorous,not often you get to watch one actor play 3 different parts but he's good and this is a humorous movie with Don knotts too. fun western!
4,don knotts fan,HIs movies are always funny. Good for a laugh. We enjoyed it alotWould buy it again if we lost this cd
3,Movie was great if I could have watched it without interruption!,"I love this movie; it is a great movie from my childhood that I recall fondly. However, the amazon player was spotty, even when it said the connection was good. It kept stopping and skipping terribly in one area of the movie, which was VERY annoying. I have never had this happen so badly before while using the amazon player. Disappointed."
4,"Funny, silly Knotts movie!",Classic Don Knotts movie. He was one of a kind and missed. Not as funny as some of the others but still classic.
5,Old Time Disney,Loved seeing the stuff I grew up with and now I'm able to share it with my kids! Great rental! :)
3,Great film for the children.,I always enjoy Don Knotts in all of his films. This show is simple but pleasant and can be enjoyed by all kids.
2,Boring movie,I looked forward to watching this movie especially after having seen Don Knotts in the Apple Dumpling gang. Did not enjoy this movie at all. Was very boring and never got through the entire movie.
2,I can't believe I watched this,"It took two sittings to get through this cheesy, poorly acted and mind numbing movie. It just wasn't that funny."
5,A household favorite,I loved this movie as a child and can now share it with my neice and nephews. It is wonderful to watch a movie and not have to worry about what's on the screen. Good wholesome family entertainment!!
3,"Hot Lead, Cold Feet","A classic western farce, this movie was purchased for my grandchildren. My two-year-old will watch this movie over and over again, almost never blinking. Of course, I watch it with her (most of the time), and though repeated viewings will jade one's opinion, the grands continue to enjoy this movie time and time again. Seems proof enough for me that this Don Knotts comedy has stood the test of time."
1,Total Loser!,"I bought this movie because I thought any film with Don Knotts in it has got to be worth watching.....wrong!!!!!! This is one of the biggest loser films I have ever seen in my middle aged life. It is sappy and contrived to the max. It was a film about a Christian preacher/missionary, and they managed to go through the entire film without saying the word ""God"" once in either dialogue, or song--of which there were many. They went completely out of their way to do this. This is Hollywood liberal political correctness run to it's furthest ridiculous extreme. This would be like having a film such as the ""Horse Whisperer"" and never mention the word ""horse"" once in the movie. How absurd!This movie had few funny moments. It had few if any good acting moments! It was quite simply once of the worst movies and biggest wastes of time I've had the misfortune to see! Total loser from every view point!"
3,not sure...,"Looks good from where I sit...not so sure tho. I've been reviewing several portable cd players today & this looks like a good buy (as far as price goes), but I've got no clue if the brand is a goody or not. Sure hope someone else writes a review, too. :)"
4,A very good source to study for the exam,I think this is a great study guide. I have not taken the test yet. I have taken sample tests and done good after reading this book. It gives you a quick understanding for the concepts behind the technologies.
4,It all depends on what you know already,"If you have a good knowledge of Windows and want to waste no time preparing for the WA exams, this is a good book along with MSDN references. But if you are a windows dummy trying to learn about windows concepts just now, you better buy other material like the Sybex guides."
1,A complete waste of time,"I read the chapters for the first exam, then tried a sample Transcender test. After failing miserably, I tried to look up the answers in the book. After a while I discovered that the page listings in the index did not match the pages in the book. Still, out of the 10 questions I looked up, I only found the answer to one of them. This book did come in a nice box though..."
1,Disappointing,"I'm terribly dissappointed in this book. Not only does this book not cover enough information for just the practice tests, there are several places in the book that fell far short of adequately explaining the concepts. Don't waste your money. I'm calling MSPress to try and get my money back."
1,Not a good preparation tool for certication exams.,"I bought this book because it is supposed to be geared toward preparing for the Windows Architecture I & II exams. However, the book fails to cover much of the exam material, and what it does cover isn't clearly organized between the two tests. I recommend not wasting your money on this one."
2,Don't waste your money,"The ""training guide"" covers the high points on the exams. If you already know everything the exams cover then this book would help pull it all together for you. But by no means does it ""offer(s) complete preparation for taking and passing the Microsoft Certified Professional Exams 70-160 and 70-161,"" as it claims on the back cover. That is pretty much a bunch of BS. I passed 160 today and am taking 161 tomorrow. I would say this about where my knowledge came from:40% Experience programming in VB and Access35% MSDN readings (mostly on stuff I had heard of but not used)20% Transcender tests (make me aware of stuff I haven't heard of)5% MS Press Training Guide. (I needed the numbers to add up to a hundred<G>)Just my two cents, but I think your money is best spent on MSDN and Transcender."
1,Microsoft's Next Lawsuit,"Fine book except it isn't what it says it is. As a professional educator, I could take students into a classroom with this book alone and they would never pass the test. Period. You will need a lot of supplemental reading and the Transender exams to pass. They are going to get themselves sued by claiming this book is all you need to pass. In no way will a newbie pass based on this book alone."
1,"No detail, all fluff, not sufficient info to pass exams","Much worse than the older ""Readings on MS Windows"" Book. I have read the sections multiple times and I have found that the questions that I missed on the practice exams are not covered at all by this kit! This book and CD set are insulting individually and as a group. Worse than having nothing at all."
5,Vapor book?,"I wonder if someone else has read this book. Yes, the table of content is very excellent! Guess the part about COM will be great too."
1,"Whatever you do, don't waste money on this piece of junk.","Ok ... I bought the book read it and went to the exams. As far as I could see, this book covers ALMOST 30% of the questions asked in the Windows Architecture I&II (MCSD Certification Series 70-160, 70-161) The book if far more useful as a doorstop or, paperweight for letters you know you'll never read !"
4,Easily digestible review of Windows Architecture,"I found the book easy to read and quickly paced. I haven't tried one of the Win Arch tests yet, so I can't say if the training kit is all one needs to pass, but it is an excellent place to start."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to pass WinArch I & II,This book doesn't cover the information that will be tested. You will need massive amounts of additional research and materials to pass the WinArch I & II. I would have rated it zero stars if I could.
1,"It should be titled as ""An Intro to Windows Pieces""","The book only contains the very high level overviews or technical commercial. It is totally BS for MS Press to say ""This Kit offers complete preparation for taking and passing the Microsoft Certified Professional Exams 70-160 and 70-161"". If you want to know how many pieces that Windows has, this book may be OK."
4,Almost Sufficient for Passing Windows Architecture I & II,"This medium sized book, with other information from MSDN Library Online or CD, is all there is to passing the Windows Architecture I & II examinations. I found this book somewhat invaluable while preparing for my MCSD exams."
1,Very Disappointing,No detail. Rushed (as mentioned before). It would make a half-way decent textbook for 6th graders who happened to have the BackOffice Suite loaded on an NT Server.
2,Use this kit only as an introduction.,"You have to use another sources. Use this kit as an introduction, then use MSDN (you have to read a lot). Several topics in the exams were not even mentioned in this kit. The CD? rating = 1. There is no test on the CD and poor animations."
2,"Not bad, but...","This book wasn't a bad overview/expensive marketing blurb. The information it contains isn't sufficient for you to pass the tests, though. As an aside, you might want to check out the Microsoft Certification site prior to purchasing this. They've announced that they're retiring WinArch II, which I'm not real happy about since I just passed it this weekend, and they're revamping the requirements. Caveat emptor."
2,Misleading book,"It would be very easy to be lulled into a sense of false security by this book as it's coverage isn't detailed enough for the exam. The end of chapter exams were very poor. Just by looking at the sample exams available on Microsoft's Website, it was obvious that it doesn't even cover all the material required by the exam.For those pursuing certification, it would make better sense to sit the electives before doing this. That way the material for the windows architecture will make more sense."
3,Could have been much better,"I had read Inside COM beforehand, and had also printed out a lot of the suggested reading. That's why I passed the test. This book did, as another reviewer suggested, help pull things together, but it definitely wasn't sufficient in itself. I know there were two questions on the test I took that weren't touched on in the book at _all_...."
2,Not what I thought it was.,This is a Cd of the history of the band. Interesting but was not a music CD. Was not worth the price.
5,great series but can get all episodes from somewhere else,"Like all the people that have giving good reviews, I will say that the story is great. Most shows and movies involving mystery focus more on the investigation, but this is different. Light Yagami wants to rid the world of evil and becomes a murderer himself. Meanwhile, the police begin investigating Kira, due to the unusual number of heart attacks. This show would probably be like dramatic irony more than anything else because we, the audience, know from the beginning that Light, the protagonist of this story, is the culprit. I recommend that everyone get this series from iTunes or Direct2Drive though because Amazon has only 16 episodes for download, while iTunes and Direct2Drive have all 37 episodes."
3,"Amazing show, BUT...","If you're going to buy it, buy it on iTunes because there are so much more advantages to buying it there then buying it on Amazon. Two examples: Video Quality and Where you can watch your video. Video quality on Amazon is not the best, its around 360p (average YouTube video quality) but on iTunes you can watch it in Full HD, even on your iPod. On Amazon, you cannot download the video onto iTunes or Windows Media Player, only the Kindle. They both sell it for the same price as well.Aside from that, AMAZING show. I got into it almost a year ago, and have loved it since. It's not like Bleach or YuGiOh, with all the fillers, It's one of those shows that's so good you want more, even after it ends."
4,Rampart,"This game is fantastic! If you enjoy strategic games instead of blowing up everything in sight, then this game is for you. This game will appeal to everyone from 3 to 300."
1,Straight port of Classic Arcade Game,"NOTHING extra, just the game that used to cost a quarter. The Graphics were made for a big screen and don't translate well to such a small screen. If you played the arcade version this will disappoint you."
4,First rate,"This is the best of the cds put out by Marcia Ball and I recommend it highly. The performances on other Ball cds is equally good, but the quality of the songwriting on this one sets it apart from the rest. (I realize 4 stars around here amounts to damning with faint praise, but geez, there ought to be some shades of gray between the ridiculous and the sublime)."
3,More of much the same,"Loved Marcia Balls other worksbut this unexciting, but with a bitmore pizzaz than Roadside Attractions.She keeps falling into the trap ofpotboiling sounds and rhythms - thoughsome differences on this album"
5,"Superb, as always",I took a workshop with Daniel Greene many years ago.. this DVD is just as helpful! Have fun with it!
2,Not a waste of money...But not the only book you will need.,"This was the second book I purchased in my quest to master Perl. The first being Perl and CGI For The World Wide Web, by Elizabeth Castro. I recommend that if you are a beginner start with something other than Teach Yourself - CGI Programming in a Week. Though not a total waste of money ( I have found it to be useful as a desktop reference. ) It will not be the last book you will ever need to purchase on your way to mastering Perl and the CGI protocol. On the bright side it does spend a fair amount of time discussing Server Side Includes, which come in handy when developing dynamic web applications. Finally, be prepared to purchase Programming Perl- by Larry Wall to truly master the language. GOOD LUCK"
3,OK Introduction to CGI,"Although there are a lot of books about CGI, few seem to be any good. In my opinion, this one fits neatly in the lower end of the spectrum. This book is basically is a simplistic introduction, provided that you already know Perl. Almost all of the examples are written in Perl.1/3rd of the book's content are appendices (MIME types, response codes, environment variables, and a CGI Perl Quick Reference).Still, it is a usable introduction to CGI with examples."
5,Great book!,"Although I do not have any Perl experience, I found this book just great to get understanding about CGI concepts and environment. I did not expect such a good book from SAMS. Must have!"
1,Begginer content written for an expert,"This has begginer level content, although is too complex for any begginer. Only purchase this book if you already know C and Perl, and have no knowledge of CGI.There are much better simple free tutorials online that could describe the basis of CGI."
1,Don't waste money,"The book has two parts - first half is without obvious purpose that makes reader pretty much tired to read any further. Once you do that you are faced with examples that one can find on the web, no explanation of Perl code as if we are expected to know that already."
4,The new Gods,"God Dethroned have evolved. On this new album, they are embracing more contemporary issues. In the past, lyrics have revolved around predictable anti-Christian themes. There is still some of that, but now the new Gods get Dethroned: the Gods of Terror. The secret cabal of criminals that run the world are given a blast-beat of due vehemence. Production-wise this is, by far, the cleanest and purest of their efforts. For the fans of very early GD this may be a little too polished, but for those who appreciate precise, thoughtful, yet still viscious metal, it is for you."
4,The holy one is dethroned,"God Dethroned's vocals can sometimes lack in quality, but their amzing riffs make up for any lost. This double-disc offers many quality black/death metal songs. Warkult is the song that i get hooked on the most. I suggest listening to them on the metal blade site before you buy it, just incase it isn't what you expected."
1,Awful,"Video was a complete waste of time, absolutely zero substance, speaker talked about all of his winners, promoted web service. Save your money!"
3,A Window Into The Past,"Some of the racial stereotypes in this book are blood-curdling. Although I'm not Chinese, I'm very closely related to a few Chinese people. The casual, popular bigotry on display in these pages is chilling. At the same time, the stories themselves are generally good. The author has a sort of covert admiration of the Chinese - especially Chinese women - that seems to drive him to write about them, but in a very prejudiced way. Looking past the throwback stereotypes, the stories are uneven. Some of the stories are startlingly good, containing a well-developed sense of irony. Other stories seem to borrow too much from Arthur Conan Doyle. The anthropological window into early 20th Century views about Asia is valuable."
3,Learning Tool,"This book is good for beginners -- tells you the ins and outs of SQL. Advanced users can find this book useful also, but some concepts are missing from it. Easy to read, practical."
3,Kindle version comments,"My comments are related only to the electronic version/aspect of this edition of Middlemarch rather than on the classic story. While this edition is readable it's a huge disappointment. There are so many typos that the reader is easily and regularly disturbed by trying to sort out misspellings, missing periods, or mangled sentences and paragraphs. Very unprofessional of Amazon to offer books that haven't been thoroughly edited. Kindle is a wonderful device - why not make sure the books are perfect? Why should a customer expect less in an e-versions than one does in hard copy?"
4,good book...but problems with this edition?,I bought the Barnes and Noble edition of this book back in 2004. I just got around to reading it. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a rich novel with lots of still-relevant insights regarding life. But the edition! There were spelling mistakes or typos on practically every page. It's jarring to read and it began to drive me crazy towards the end. Hopefully there is a new Barnes and Noble edition of the book and they have since corrected these mistakes.
5,middlemarch,"great book I loved reading it its written so beatifully, I definately recomended it brings you back to england in the 1800's ."
2,too much for me,"I am an avid reader of many different types of literature, and am used alot of different styles of prose. Despite my past readings however I simply could not enjoy this book. It has a style all of itself. Perhaps other readers enjoyed this highly rated novel, but I did not care for the overall style and the excessive wordiness."
2,Not my kind of book.,I'm reading this book for my Great Books class at university and it is one of the hardest reads for most of the class. I have a lot of difficulty getting into the story and find myself skipping huge parts of it and just using sparknotes to see if I missed anything.
2,Why? Why?,I HAD to read this book for my high school senior english class. I started reading it and to this day I do not understand why the author had to use 771 pages for a great story. This book wuold have been perfect if it had not been so drawn out. At some points it even gets tortorous. Read this book if you have all the time AND pacience in the world ONLY. It is just too BLAH!
2,Jogging Through Jell-o,My mother described reading this book like jogging through Jell-o and I am inclined to agree. I attempted to read it due to continually being rated as on of the top 100 novels of all time. I made it 16% of the way according to my Kindle and just couldn't do it anymore. I found it to be difficult to follow and prone to tangents.
1,Horrible formatting for the Kindle edition,"The book itself is fine. However, the font style and formatting used by the Oxford press is really unattractive, and there is no way to change the font style. You can change the size of the font but not the actual font style itself. It is a very old style and looks like something from the 1800s. I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers. When given a choice, I always use the Oxford edition of classics, but for this book I switched over to the Penguin edition just because of the way the work is displayed on the Kindle 2 screen. Horrible job Oxford!"
1,Huge Disappointment!,"Don't remember when I've been so let down, especially given the high level of praise from the reviewers I read before purchasing. Gave up in frustration after completing less than 25% of the book.What a sad collection of wordy FLUFF!"
3,Good characters but tedious,Had to give up after about 300 pages. Admired how she developed the characters but the story moved along way too slowly so that I often fell asleep while reading it. At least the numerous run-on sentences provided some amusement. May try another novel by George Elliot if I can find a shorter one. Most of the books I read are quite lengthy but I finish them because they are engrossing stories written with a comprehensible sentence structure.
1,Unreadable,"I've read stories and books from different ages throughout the years that used language not akin to our own. Many of these books were interesting and thought provoking. This story, written in a more recent era where the language should be readable as in the works of Upton Sinclair, is not. Don't waste your time downloading it."
4,A long March,"Middlemarch is not an ""easy"" read as it requires attention to the footnotes, and is 800 pages. It is an excellent study of women's places in British society in the 19th century. It made me grateful to live in modern times, and not be subject to the control of a autocratic husband. The long sections on politics did not interest me much, but I found it necessary to follow them in order to fully understand the story. Even so, it is a great novel, and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it."
3,Effusive descriptive saga,The basic storyline is of four young people whose lives develop based on their young aspirations and beliefs set in the early English community of Middlemarch. The dictates of class and gender provide obstacles showing the struggles of living the life one envisions and what birth dictates. The writing is effusive with descriptive detail that was often tedious although well written.
5,A great classic,"This is an excellent classic love story. It is a little slow at times, but even worth re-reading. I would say more, but I read the book a long time ago."
3,"Fine literature, but . . .","There is no question that this novel is a work of fine literature and an unusually in-depth portrait of the lives of a few characters. On this merit alone, it is worth reading. But . . .I found the book, despite its astuteness, to be rather dull and dry, and ultimately boring. While I appreciate detail, I also appreciate aesthetic description, and her ongoing passages were simply not amusing enough to keep me interested. Don't get me wrong: I understand that literature is not all about feel-good entertainment. But this novel is as lacking in the aesthetic department as it is brilliant in the technical/analytical. And when a book truly bores you, what difference does it make how fine a novel it is?"
3,I didn't realize it was abridged. Unfortunate.,"I don't like abridged books, and didn't notice it was an abridged edition. Am disappointed. I realize it said it was abridged, but didn't notice it."
3,Typos abound,"Great novel. However, this edition is riddled with typos. Misplaced words, faulty paragraphing, and incorrect punctuation pop up continuously when compared to an Oxford edition I have. The good news is it's free. So really can't complain too vigorously about such things. And the story is a superior one."
2,"Great Book, Disgraceful Edition","This novel doesn't need my praise. But this edition needs censure. I have found over fifty typos and legitimate mistakes, the kind of thing you almost never see except in translations. ""Unconquerable"" is rendered ""conquerable,"" ""in"" becomes ""is"" (so you get things like ""All force is twain is one""). You can't read more than a few pages without being distracted.It's embarrassing that this edition slipped by even a single editor."
5,One of the few English novels written for grown-ups,"Virginia Woolf called Middlemarch ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up peole"", and I could not agree with her more. In contrast to her male contemporaries such as Dickens or Thackeray with their sentimentality and their clean stories, Eliot comes as close to facing the ""boredom, the horror and the glory"" as a C19 novelist can.Middlemarch is essentially about how lives can go wrong. It starts out with idealistic Dorothea Brooke wanting to reform the world and young Tertius Lydgate being about to rock the medical world with striking new discoveries. Eliot shows what life does to those two. Or better say, she points out how it is essentially each person himself or herself who is responisble for what happens. ""Time will say nothing but I told you so.""No reader can fail to be touched by the wake-up call of this book: We must face what we are about to to with our lives and not take important decisions lightly."
5,Beautiful,"This book is wonderful from start to finish. Eliot deserves rank with the great classic writers. She has created fully realized characters about whom one comes to care. Her writing is pure 19th century--long descriptions and careful, insightful observations. I realize in today's world that we want things presented with ""more matter and less art"" but to find the art of Eliot, it is well worth wading through the 800-plus pages. This ranks up there with the best books I have ever read."
3,On the Modern Library Edition,"""Middlemarch"" is, doubtlessly, a brilliant masterpiece. George Eliot shows what a profound and original mind. Her skills in narration and characterization are among the very best of English writers. However, the Modern Library Edition, despite the nice binding and paper quality, is plagued with little errors which ought to be easily resolved by one more round of careful proofreading. These little nuisances tend to get in the way of reading, I find, and I do hope that Modern Library will deliver a proof-read edition sometime in the near future."
3,Annoying.,This version of Middlemarch did not have all of the same punctuation as the Original Edition and I was very annoyed at some points trying to figure out what a certain character meant.
3,Hard going,"I have failed to finish this great novel once again. It was too long for me, the prose style seemed laboured and the constant explanations of what people were thinking unnecessary. I think I would have stuck it out if I could have identified with Dorothea."
2,"Warm, fuzzy, too long. Think Tolstoy after a lobotomy.","Middlemarch is treated as a classic: it shouldn't be. While it has some amusing stock characters and portrays some of the great disappointments of life, its moralizing is overt and its plot is boring.The characterization is thorough and and frequently good. But the villians are all too villainous and the good guys all too good. One can see the ending a mile off, and one begins to shift in one's seat after only 200 pages.However, one hopes that the end would have some twist that would dispell the reader's suspicions of a transparent march to an inexorable ending. Eliot disappoints with her anticlimactic and smarmy ending."
1,"Warped CD's, Unfortunately Abridged.","I am very unhappy with this product. Although it is described as 'unabridged' that was not the case at all. I suppose I should have known this from the fact that there were fewer CD's than other audio offerings, but I believed the description. Two of the CD's were so warped they wouldn't spin in my stereo. I was extremely unhappy with this purchase.I needed to read this book for a university class. As I love literature, I would ordinarily have purchased the book, but I have had some health problems crop up unexpectedly and am having trouble with my eyes. I thought the audio book would be the way to go. So much of Eliot's wonderful narrative voicing is lost in this abridged version, and the actress who reads sometimes tends to mumble. It was impossible to hear in the car.Loved the book, hated this version. I listened through the end of the first disk, then had to give up as the second arrived too warped to play. Completely disappointing."
2,what happened to the downtempo groove?,"It's got a few good tunes on it, but being someone that was immediately taken by AL by getting 1-7, 7 almost sounds too commercial. It's like 7 was produced by someone else it seems. Lionel Richie's Easy on AL 7 and Marvin Gayes Sexual Healing on AL 6 are great songs, but I just don't think the typical AL buyer is buying the cds for those types of songs. To catch the real downtempo AL vibe, start with the first one, Ambient Lounge 1, and work your way up. I hope AL 8 will go back to its roots.."
1,Not What I Expected,"I expect that a book with a subtitle of ""An Investigative Approach"" would teach concepts through discovery learning. That is the trend for learning/teaching nowadays. In fact, this book teaches math concepts like every other math book, it just has little activities to reinforce the concepts. I wasn't that impressed by the activities, either.What I want and can't find is a math book of discovery learning activities that help students uncover the ideas by connecting previous knowledge in a new way. I also want a book that provides meaningful, real-world applications to the concepts learned. This book isn't it."
3,"Not short of action, thats for sure","Once again, we find our hard-core hero thrown into another entirely unbeleivable situation crammed with enough gunfights, explosions, wickedly evil terrorists, and foul language to last a lifetime in 2 hours. It is fun to watch as pretty much anyone will be entertained by it, but the plot is more of a repeat of the last one than anything else. This is probobly the worst of the three movies, but for most guys it is still worth a watch. An action-packed adrenaline rush that will leave you begging for more. (Plot that is) Keep it as far away from your kids as humanly possible, or you will spend your life savings in a week on soap washing their mouths out."
3,Die Hard 2: Die Not-so hard,"Renny Harlin directed this sequel to the immensely popular action flick Die Hard. While the 2nd instalment has it's moments, it's pretty much more of the same, as Bruce Willis gets back in sweaty vest mode as John McClane, with William Atherton. But this time around, the action, while impressive, isn't as cool as the first one, and the villains aren&#65533;t as well written or interesting. Harlin's trademark over- the- top action is always present however, and this makes for some enjoyable action stunts and heroics.As action sequels go, it's good enough to satisfy fans of the franchise, and despite its faults, director Harlin (Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea) knows how to string together some impressive action scenes. The extras are good, with a commentary from Harlin, making of's, deleted scenes, trailers, visual effects 'making of's and some other cool stuff. A good film made better by the extras."
4,"Weakest of the trilogy, but still pretty good","The main problem with this film is the terrorists' plan would never have worked in real life. Planes with ""only"" an hour's worth of fuel could have easily gotten to an airport in Canada! Also, why didn't the tower people use the radio in one of the planes on the ground? That said, Die Hard 2 is well above average. The action is top notch, and the thrills never stop coming. Renny Harlin adds his own unique style of direction, which is well appreciated. Although it might have been better with John McTiernnan, you'll still get your moneys worth."
3,It was alright,"wanted to watch this series for a long time.... It was a great thriller at the time but now, it 's a little old but still classic"

2,The Worst Die hard.,This is the worst of the 3. Not very entertaing and the effects really suck. It seems that they wanted to make a little more money off the first. Even bruce willis hated this. The thired on is alittle better because they actually took some time to make a villian. skip this one and go see Live Free or Die Hard in theaters June 27th 2007.
4,"The movie is good, blu-ray audio quality is suspect","This is my least favorite in the series. The video quality of the blu-ray is much improved from the sd dvd. The audio however is a big problem. Depending on what type of blu-ray player you have, you may not get any sound or only the core DTS. There was a problem with authoring this disc and FOX has been aware of it since the disc was released. I and other on a particular forum have been waiting more than 1 year now for FOX to release a replacement but the replacement they sent was exactly the same disc. Unless you get a blu-ray version from the U.K. or Australia (this disc is region-free)you may not get what you want from the audio.A big disappointment from FOX."
2,Blu-Ray Review,Just slightly better than standard dvd five star collection version. Audio quality is better than the picture quality.
5,Die Hard @-Dvd,Everything went well. Dvd came on time and is a great quality disc! My wife was very happy because this is her favorite movie of all time. Thank you for this great service!
3,"Great premise, not so great execution",Terrorists take over the air traffic control center and all communications with in flight planes at La Guardia or JFK. It's a chilling scenario and I have to say that the first half hour of the film was superb.Unfortunately the film turns into a series of cliches soon after that. I felt like the director was really rushing the production of the 2nd half of the movie. He should have taken more time.The turning point is when Bruce is blown (ejects) into the air from the cockpit of that plane. That scene was not very well shot against an obvious backdrop and the film never recovered after that. It just lost its' edge.Worth a rental but not a purchase.
5,Die Hard goes on...,Another piece in what turns out to be a great adventure through a four part action viewing experience!
3,Overreaches but still exciting,"While this installment is the weakest of the three, it still has some exciting moments. All in all, I think the film tried so hard to top the first (best) Die Hard film, that the failure is that much more evident.The characterizations are not as well fleshed-out as in the others. The action scenes become predictable and less exciting as the movie progresses.I had to laugh at one of the BIGGEST continuity flaws I've ever witnessed in a big-budget movie: the plane that crashes is forced to the ground by lack of fuel. Why, then, does it explode in a HUGE fireball if it's out of gas? Somebody screwed up."
4,one sequal that works,"This is one sequal that stays right on line with the original. Bruce Willis is in top form in this one and for me anyway, this is the best of the two that follow the original. Director Renny Harlin puts the action in high gear by combining a snow storm, a busy airport at xmas under terrorist control, and the threat of planes falling from the sky as they run our of fuel. As typical with the first Die Hard, once the action starts it doesnt stop until the film ends. There is great support acting such as Dennis Franz as the airport security chief, Bonnie Bedelia returns as Mclaines ex wife, the casting of Fred Dalton Thompson, polician and actor, as the chief of operataions is excellent. And there a host of others that add to a never a dull moment of a film. Buy the DVD, its been remastered in Dolby 5.1, and is perfect on surround sound."
4,"Certainly Not as Good as the First, but not Half Bad","This was certainly a sequel, but it was nearly as bad as some sequels have been. I didn't find that this movie was as orginal as the first, but it was well written giving the movie the ability to draw a good crowd who could still enjoy it."
1,Audio Doesn't Work! Buyer Beware!,"As soon as the movie would started, and the audio switches to DTS-HD, it would either go totally quiet or make this little clicking noises like there were aliens trying to talk to us. Unfortunately I didn't know there were problems with this disc, so I spent all kinds of time fooling around with my equipment. Buyer Beware! They are having issues with DTS-HD audio on this movie. It did work when I switched to Dolby Surround, but who wants to listen to that if your into uncompressed audio?"
3,Three and a half stars,"Die Hard 2 is a fun action packed movie. However, it is my least favorite Die Hard installment of the 4. The two biggest reasons for this is the horrible dialogue and the fact that it basically rehashes the first movie except for the fact it takes place at an airport instead of a building. Like I said though it is still an enjoyable movie with lots of action. Its worth watching or buying if you are a fan of the series."
3,Big disapointment for Die Hard fans,"This one was the worst of the series, even though it was pretty good. It was nothing surprising. I thought this was an okay movie, but could have been much better. It was too dark all the time, that was way unecessary. The other two are much more enlightning. Jon Maclean(Bruce Willis) in this one must stop terrorists from blowing up a plane his wife is on. He happens to talk to the cop that defended him and stood by him the 1st time. That's only for a few minutes of the movie, he did a good job in the 2 die hards he was in. Bruce Willis was outstanding though!! From the dumbest cop, to the smartest one, and the least suspected one to betray, it's a good movie! The worst of the Die Hards but still interesting, I liked it!!"
5,The King of Modern Action Spectaculars,"Easily the best of the trilogy. The big daddy of em all, y'all. A masterpiece. Anyone who questions Mr. Willis' acting abilities is advised to revisit the ""I was pretty goddamn useless"" scene. The Die Hard movies are all notable for promoting racial decency, in that each film McClane is helped by a black man (Reginald VelJohnson in the first, Samuel L. Jackson in #3, and Art Evans here). And then there's the equal opportunity casting of the film's villains, in which John Amos shakes that ""Good Times"" image for good. William Sadler is the best Die Hard villain of them all. Not only does the sequel top the original, it annihilates it!"
3,Die Hard 2 (Blu Ray),This is the second best in the Die Hard series. The Blu Ray edition makes it even more fun at the movies. Check it out for yourself.
3,Die Hard fan--but,"I am a big fan of the Die Hard series. But not the profanity that's really the main character. I would like to have known that the f-bomb is hurled just about every two seconds before I purchased it. Other than that, the action and plot are great. I rate it 3 stars because of that."
5,This was great!!!!!!!,"In this movie we find John Mcclane at Dulles airport just waiting for his wife to fly in. all of the sudden terrorist take over the airport and McClanes wifes plane is forced to circle above it. This was a great movie with all the great stunts and the ejection chair, but I thought that it would have been alot better if the terrorist went in the airport and took it over not from a near by church. I cant wait for Die Hard 5, Die Hardest."
5,Highly recommend...,"High five and some for Kimberla. You are a gifted author. ""Casting the First Stone"" is a well written true to life story. I love this novel just as I did ""Behind Closed Doors"" and ""Here and Now"".Rev. Black was just too much. How long did he think he could continue to do the work of the devil? Over and over Tanya was giving her husband a chance. He took his family and church for granted.The discussion questions are really good. I know that everyone can relate to the novel. Kimberla, I wish you all the best. Be Blessed!"
1,CAST THE FIRST STONE,"I absolutely loved the book HERE and NOW and couldn't wait to purchase and read CAST THE FIRST STONE. I found the book quite disappointing, however. It lacked the depth of HERE and NOW and though the theme could have made for an interesting read, the book droned. I read it until the end (although I'm not sure why), but would not recommend it. If you want to read it, I would suggest you borrow it from a friend."
1,Not Impressed At All,"I was very disappointed in this book. I found the character development poor and I was tired of Tanya in each chapter discussing her desire to leave Curtis but why she couldn't. She also spent a great deal of time discussing abused women and too much detail on clothing, cars, coach bags, etc.. which was unnecessary for me. Overall, I was not impressed. I also did not find the writing challenging. This is no J. California Cooper or Toni Morrison."
4,Pastor Black Is A Mess,"I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow at times, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it. By the time I got towards the end of the book I didn't want to stop. The basis of the book is about Tanya trying to believe and wait on Pastor Black her husband to become the husband he should be. Pastor Black says one thing in the pulpit and does the opposite as soon as he says amen. The book is a trip. How long will Tanya wait on Pastor Black? Will his ways finally catch up to him? You'll have to read it. The book is really good!"
4,Amazing,"This book was incredible, It brought out all of my emotions, it made me mad, sad and glad. It was definitely a page turner and it kept me wondering what in the world would Curtis do next. I wanted to yell at Tanya for not leaving this is how into this book I was. Having been involved in the church brought all the characters to life for me. Kim is very talented and I'm looking forward to reading her new book."
5,Excellent storytelling,I really enjoyed this book. I read it in one sitting because it was such a page turner. Tanya is such a memorable character with whom you will have great empathy and compassion. Her journey of self-discovery will leave you with a smile once you finish the book. I look forward to reading other books by Mrs. Roby.
5,Let's have church,"This book takes a look at both personal relationships and church relationships. The first family of the church - Curtis and Tanya Black - start out on the right foot from college. Unfortunately, as years go bye Curtis loses sight of the real goal and begins focusing on the boastful pride of life. While Tanya disapproves of her husband's focus, she does not want to shatter the ""perfect family picture"". Well, the picture gets shattered and oh how it gets shattered.This book is well written, tells an excellent story and captivates right from the start. The book demonstrates the strength and weaknesses of those professing versus those possessing."
4,EXCELLENT READ!,"This was a terrific read. The author tells a superb story. The heroine did get on my nerves a few times because she was so incredibly complacent.However, I do want to point out that the author holds her own in presenting her material. One of the reviews on the book cover compares her work to that of Terry McMillan. I just want to go on record and say that there is no comparison needed. This author sets her own standards (very high I might add) and delivers. I look forward to more from her."
4,Good Reading,"I enjoyed this book. It did take a few chapters for me to really get into the book, but eventually I could not put the book down. This book is a definite must read. It's about time someone told this story. Much success and blessings to Kim Roby. I'm waiting for the next one. Peace!"
4,"Sad subject, good story!","I was truly sorry to read that the topic matter was of a Baptist Minister with a promising congregation, but the story was good because it could be true. I was proud of the main character, Tanya, for sticking to her guns and looking out for herself and her daughter, because they are who matters. Curtis, who is no-good anyway, got what he deserved. The ending was surprising and had a good finale. I was intrigued througout the entire story and was hoping and praying for James the whole way through. This is a worthwhile book and a good weekender if you want something to keep your attention and is easy to read."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I consider myself to be a great fan of Lawson-Roby's previous novels, but this book left a lot to be desired. The same points and ideas were belabored again and again and it took away from the interest of the book. While I LOVED 'Behind Closed Doors' and 'Here and Now' I wonder why the wit and skill reflected in those books was not seen in this one. And if I had to read one more insignificant detail...To the Editor or whoever advised her to add more scenery or bulk to scenes: READERS DO NOT LIKE INSIGNIFICANT DETAILS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACE OF THE STORYLINE. Kimberla, get a new editor.."
2,Needs a rewrite,"This could have been a better book if the author spent more time on character development. For example, Tanya's boyfriend was not a well developed character. He was just thrown in for a happy ending. Curtis was far more interesting. I wanted to know what made him tick."
2,Good Plot Amateurishly Written,"Roby has an interesting plot line, although it leans toward the predictable and sometimes turns preachy. Still, it's a good story with a logical plot and a significant message. Mrs. Roby has the potential to be a terrific writer, but she needs to develop her craft to reach beyond the amateur technique, sentence construction, and punctuation errors that plague her novel and distract from her story. Her natural ability provides a good outline, but her lack of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group. Investing herself in such opportunities for critique would polish her natural ability and challenge her to strive for excellence and craftsmanship. With the odds she's beaten already, what is there to fear from an opportunity to sharpen her skills?"
1,zzzzzzzzz,"Can I give it negative stars?The topic that this book attempts to takcle is relevant and real in today's society, but this author writes like an 8th grade English paper. HORRIBLE BOOK. Here is my summary:My name is Tanya and I know my husband is a cheater, but I can't seem to get it through my thick skull that I need to leave him. I just ate a ceaser salad and mozzerella sticks. I always speak in complete sentences and never use contractions or slang. James is so attractive. OOOH I drank wine I'm going to hell. Boink boink boink threesome on video. Public humiliation. Finally I leave my scumbag husband. Now I'm married to James.The end."
2,This book is overrated!,"I ain't trying to hate or anything but I didnt like Casting the First Stone by Kimberla Lawson Roby. I thought the soap opera plot was built upon stereotypes of the one dimensional characters who I found completely lacking in depth. I disliked it so much that I was completely turned off by the idea of attempting to read the sequel Too Much of a Good Thing, even after I read the preview online on the authors website. I kept thinking to myself ""hasnt this negro(Curtis Black) learned anything."""
5,The Book Club,Casting the First Stone was the first book for our new book club. It was a wonderful book. I could not put it down from the first time that I started to read. We had a book talk and discussed the questions in the back. Every member of our club enjoyed the book. We can't wait to read the next one. The questions in the back is a fabulous idea.
5,Casting The First Stone had me up all night.,"I could not put this book down until I found out what happened to Tanya and her play boy husband, Reverend Curtis Black."
4,Casting the First Stone by Kimberla Lawson Roby,"This book starts off ""slow"" but explodes into bone tingling excitement. The author carefully leads the reader to wonder if there will ever be an end to the ""madness"".Eventually there is a long awaited unvailing of the obvious, along with the twist of a couple of unexpected events."
4,pretty good,"This is the story of Tanya who is married to a preacher who is a cheater, and fooling his church members. Tanya was at crossroads about what to do about her cheating husband. I felt a little bad when Tanya took it to the next level with James, because she was suppose to be a chrisitan also, and didn't have to stoop to Curtis's level. ""Casting the fist stone"" gives you a look of some of the bad things that goes on in church these day. I have a friend who don't trust any preachers because of the ones like Curtis."
4,"A good read, but I could put it down......","This was a pretty good book. The story was very real, but it dragged....just a bit. It could have been a little more exciting. Even though I enjoyed it, I didn't have a hard time putting it down like when I read Sistah Souljah's ""The Coldest Winter Ever"".I would reccomend this book, because it was interesting, but it just didn't have that wave of excitement that I was looking for."
5,Ain't That the Truth!,"Kimberla is an excellent, driven ""authoress"". She not only puts you right into the book and its characters, but she carries you throughout their story until the end, where you say, oh my goodness, that's it? I want MORE! She makes you feel as though she could write another book to accompany this one. With everything going on in the church world today, she's right on target with this one! I especially loved the way she made you feel as though you were a part of her book and could say, girl, I know how she's feelin'! I actually got a little upset because I had to go to work and wouldn't be able to read 'Casting The First Stone' for at least 7 hours of the day! It was that fabulous! Keep up the good work, my sista!"
4,"Excellent subject matter, a must read","I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Roby's book. It speaks to several issues going on in several (but not all) churches today, which is very sad and unfortunate. I think every african american church going-member who is STRONG IN THEIR WALK should read this book. However, for the sake of a realistic plot and story, I loved it. Our book club, The F.I.R.M., gave it rave overall reviews. Thanks for being bold enough to tackle this subject. I must now backtrack and read previous novels to see how Ms. Roby's writing has developed over time. I look forward to future works and subjects."
2,Book was in fair condition,"The book was missing the jacket and had a little stains, however that was not the reason for the 2 stars. I did not like the story line and I can't imagine reading all 7 or 8 books.I gave the book to my daughter, I don't think she have read it yet. I will give her other books a try."
4,Pastor Black is a MESS!!,"I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow at times, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it. By the time I got towards the end of the book I didn't want to stop. The basis of the book is about Tanya trying to believe and wait on Pastor Black her husband to become the husband he should be. Pastor Black says one thing in the pulpit and does the opposite as soon as he says amen. The book is a trip. How long will Tanya wait on Pastor Black? Will his ways finally catch up to him? You'll have to read it. The book is really good!"
3,"""What I Thought of Mrs. Roby's Novel""","I liked Casting the First Stone by Kimberly Lawson Roby, and it was definately a page turner, but I did not favor the way the novel ended. It was very interesting, and brought to life the very negative aspects of the abuse of power when it comes to ministers in today's society, but the novel to me did not concentrate fully on the notion of forgiveness as it relates to a Christian lifestyle, neither the sanctity of marriage and the vows made before God. I think marriage is very important, and there seemed to be the constant theme of ending a marriage rather than going before God and soliciting not only the Lord's help, but professional help to save the one thing that the Lord holds sacred in this earth: the union of two people as one. Overall, the novel was well written, but nevertheless it casted a shadow over trying to make a marriage work, and exemplfied the alternative, in the long run taking the easy route of divorce."
4,Sum'n Rott'n in the Pulpit,"That Reverend Curtis is sum'n else! These preachers are greedy dogs (so says Isaiah). They can never get enuf satisfaction. They want Sister Sally and Sister Sally's momma and her grandmomma too. They just can't get enuf of that funky stuff. This book told the naked truth about these so-called Reverends. It was a well-written, entertaining novel and deserves 4.5 stars. I recommend it especially to those of you that knows that y'alls pastor ain't no-good! Maybe it'll wake you and shake you to leave that vulture of a preacher. But if you know that your pastor ain't no good and you choose to stay under his teachings, then all I can say is that birds of a feather, flock together."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I read Here and Now first then Behind Closed Doors, I wasn't that enthused about Casting the First Stone. Many of the chapters seemed to be long and boring and reiterating the same dialogue. However I do comend Kim on choosing a very touchy topic, but her approach wasn't that clever."
3,In the hands of more skilled author...,"the book could've been better. I wish the author would work on her writing skills before attempting another book. The repetitive use of words and ideas, as well as the number of totally distinct ideas joined by the word ""and"" was distracting from the storyline. The story was interesting but it failed to flow as the characters backtracked over the same ground."
1,KIM ROBY-I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"Casting the First Stone, a novel which supposedly exposes corruption in the church family, failed miserably. It really exposes corruption in the literary community by passing itself off as quality literature and ripping off hundreds of readers looking for substance and quality. Kimberla Roby has not mastered the writing craft and this book shows it. The words don't sing, they huddle together like a clumps of gooey mess staining over two hundred pages. The characters are shallow, the writing is repetitive, and the writer insists on telling the reader information they already know. Page after page after page, the writer tortured her readers with needless nonsense, perpetrating the myth of keeping a family together and then she turns around and commits adultery. Do two wrongs make a right? The topic of the book is a worthy subject, but this author does it no justice."
3,Could've Been Better,"This book was o.k. Nothing to write home about. It took 267 pages before the GOOD REVEREND got what was coming to him. Every chapter Tanya talked about how she should leave him, BUT she wanted to do what was best for her daughter. If a man is cheating on you and trying to play you for a fool AND you have ALLLL the evidence you need than WHAT is the hold up. She prolonged the story ...Better luck next time."
2,Will You Hurry It Up A Bit?,"I liked the premise, and I also like that the character seemed to be able to see through her husband's lies. The problem was that for the whole first half of the book, Tanya seems to do nothing but mull--over and over again. I wanted to yell at her to just follow the man instead of confronting him for the umpteenth time and doing nothing.As previous readers say, the book takes way too long make small progressions, yet seems to skip over important details--especially like how Curtis became the man he is and started his life of deception; and Tanya's relationship with Rebound Man seems too rushed.The premise of the book, I like, I just really dislike the pacing."
4,Never glorify your pastor...,"""Casting the First Stone,"" was a masterpiece, a clear depiction of a corrupt minister. Curtis Black was placed on a pedastal by his family and congregation, glorified to no end. However, he didn't live by the words he preached, which is very realistic in our own lives. Lesson learned, never glorify the man on the pulpit. Hear the pastors words and look up to God for guidance.~LeBlanc author of ""Characters of Lust"""
4,Casting The First Stone,This is a great read! Keep up the good work Kimberla! I really liked this book because it realistically discussed controversial yet relevant issues of relationships today.... It takes a chapter or two to pick up...but DO NOT put it down! This talented author pulls you into the story and the main characters' lives.... The ONLY thing that I would have liked to see was a little more background information on Curtis Black... There is also a discussion group guide at the back of the book which has some really provocative questions.....I highly recommend this book...This would be great for a Jack and Jill book meeting! You won't be disappointed!
4,MMPH- MMPH-MMPH!,"I believe the main reason this book was a page turner to me was because it hit too close to home with an extrememly similiar incident in a church I once belonged to. Unfortunately, it is also the main reason I no longer attend church, too hypocritical.In any case, I did get a little tired of Tanya's prolonged excuses to do something about the situation and using her precious daughter as one excuse. There were many instances where I thought she could have been doing some detective work on her own instead of sitting home on her butt wondering. As for Curtis, he finally gets what he deserves...no mercy! I'm waiting for Too Much of a Good Thing to be delivered, I'd like to keep up with how this ends up."
2,More of the Same,"Same old relationship drama - however, this one involves a minister and his wife. Predictable story and outcome. My biggest gripe was the typeface. Not appealing at all. 2.5 stars."
5,And Let the Truth Be Told,"I have not, in a long time, been able to sit down and read a book of 300 pages. ""Casting the First Stone"" was very exciting and I felt like a major part of Tanya's life. I enjoyed how the author portrayed each of the characters and the church. For the past three years I have not been a member of any church, because of the Curtis' that exist. I believe that if I were to write a book today, it would be entitled ""And Let the Truth Be Told"" focusing on today's Black churches and the powers within.I enjoyed the writer's book because she used stores and places that I could relate to today. I am planning to read her other books, but I hope that they will not have the same story line. But I like enjoying what was going to happen every minute that I read the book. Roby, keep up the good work."
3,Casting The First Stone,"While I appreciate Ms. Roby's ability to hook me in and keep me engaged throughout the novel, I'm afraid to admit that this novel is VERY predictable. I couldn't help but think that this was yet another edition off of the assembly line of African-American novels that have appeared on shelves in recent years. It's time for us to write about more than men cheating on their wives - as an African-American, I feel that our experience is SO MUCH more varied than that. Just an opinion."
3,CAN I GET A WITNESS?,"I enjoyed this book, however, I must say that the beginning was very slow. I was very tired of Tanya's indecisiveness when it came to her leaving Curtis. But after I decided to give the book another chance, it began to pick up. I truly appreciated this book and I would recommend it to others.Always remember to put your faith in the CREATOR, because HUMANS will always let you down."
2,Not so good,"This book took forever to get to the best parts. As some of the readers said Tanya took forever to make her mind up as to what she was going to do about her cheating husband. Although I never expected the to find out those other things the Pastor did, it was still a little slow for me. I read one of Mrs, Roby other books and that was better than this one (Changing Faces)I purchased Too much of a good thing, and The best kept secret at the same time hoping that they all would be good books to read. From the looks of Casting the first stone, I'm not looking forward to reading the other ones.Overall I could have save my time and money, I killed time reading it but I would have rather reading the newspaper.Sorry!"
5,A MUST READ,"I really enjoyed reading Casting The Firt Stone. Roby really showed the actuality of what goes on in the personal lives of some religious leaders. The characters were like people in everyone's hometown as well as church. This was the first book of Mrs. Roby's, but it won't be my last."
5,Couldn't Put it Down!,"I was captivated by this book from the first page and couldn't put it down. The storyline is believeable and it was interesting to see how Tanya was going to deal with the situation that she found herself in. Of course, this is just one of the many reasons that I was intrigued with the book. I knew that Curtis was going to get was coming to him, it was just a matter of when and by whom!I have already e-mailed my friends about this book and told them that they must put it on their list to read.Keep up the good work Kimberla Lawson Roby - I look forward to your next publication."
3,It's a fun game to play. It has 2 games in one.,It is a game to play over and over and has a 2 person ability. The object of both games is to kill all enemies on a level and then go on to the next. It has only okay graphics and not much color. Over all I think its a fun game.
1,Hard to recommend,"Unless you MUST have a small, light edition of ""The Story of Art,"" you will fare much better with the regular 16th edition.Why?In this ""Pocket Edition,"" the text and illustrations have been separated. The text comes up front, and all the plates are at the back. In my opinion, a terrible idea, mostly because the author refers CONSTANTLY to the plates.The publishers apparently realized there was a problem with this misorganization, because they supplied two ribbon book-markers -- one to mark your place in the text, and the other to mark your place in the plates.The result is a study in frustration, trying to keep both markers in place while trying to follow the author's discussion. In my case, updating the markers actually caused me to lose the thread of the discussion.How much better it is, to have the illustrations printed right alongside the text, which is the way the book has always been printed.Get the 16th edition and save your money."
1,Worst programming book I've ever read,"The book has the worst explanations of programming concepts I have ever attempted to read and the CD-ROM is nearly worthless. You will be fortunate indeed if the examples work with your installation of VB6. Several of the examples that were to supposed to use a data control actually displayed a picture box and never did work as a data control. The only way that I could get them to work was to delete the picture boxes, add a data control and program it. For that I didn't need this book or the waste of my time trying to make the examples work. As a database programmer, I feel that the money spent on this book was a waste. I might as well have burned the money for warmth."
2,Mixed review - be careful of the Source Code on the CD,"In general I liked the book. In some areas it was very helpful. The typesetting with the very wide left margins insured that the example code was very hard to follow at most times. My biggest problem was with the sample code on the CD. To run the code I wanted to try, I was supposed to load the sample database on SQL Server. The SQL script in the MS folder for creating the database does _not_ run on SQL Server 6.5. The author and the publisher should have checked this out. After hand creating the tables, the code would still not run as the author had not tested it with no data. Seemed to bring in to question the quality of the information in the book."
5,Focus on the Big Problems,"This book is a must read for anyone company thinking about process improvement. The MVT process is incredibly logical - Focus on your largest strategic issues with the biggest improvement opportunities. Test lots of ideas to quickly get answers as to which ones help, hurt or have no effect. Then implement the solutions that real world test data has proven will work. The results Holland describes seem almost ""too good to be true'... but when executives from DuPont, Williams-Sonoma, Citibank, etc. are telling of their own successes, you have to believe that MVT really does work."
4,MVT--a great tool,"This is a great book and should be taught at the college along with a supporting statistics package. The essence of the book is in the Placket-Burman fractional designs and how to analyze them. QualPro keeps some of their business secrets and that detracts from the books ""useability"" and in that respect, the book was a downer. They also put in a few plugs for hiring a ""MVT"" consultant--which is more like advertising than telling a story. However, the methodology is sound and needs to be used in more areas."
3,Buyer Beware Review of Reviews for MVT,"Many of the following reviews appear to be a case of overzelaous MVT proponents who got togther on Aug 20-21 '06 and in April 15-16 '06 to write smashing 5 star reviews of the MVT consulting promo book.However it appears the book does have some value, but being better than six sigma is not saying much. Several case studies in the book are no doubt true, but you have to be a special MVT consultant to use the avanced statstical methods. However, they may not be needed for one to get valuable ideas from the book. One balanced reviewer suggest the remedy may be in getting the book: ""Design of Experiments for Scientists and Engineers"", to run the complex statstical models.I still plan to buy the book, used, just not today."
5,A scientific approach to help tackle difficult challenges,"The plethora of quality fads that suddenly erupted twenty years ago saw U.S. corporate interest in managing improvement flare and then fizzle. Company after company realized that there was little substance in the low wattage methods that characterized that era. Many of us felt then that there must be somewhere a more scientific approach to help tackle difficult challenges than ""form a team, flowchart and fishbone"".Chuck Holland, it is now clear, knew the answer all along and has recently documented it in his new book on MVT.The testing of practical, fast, and cost free ideas, in large screening tests that are then followed by refining tests, makes enormous sense!The impressive success stories, from a wide variety of applications, underscore the fact that scientific testing methods can improve any process."
4,Great Business Improvement Book!,"This is a very informative book, it presents a solid approach to process improvement. The detailed 12-step process gives a clear picture of how to truly improve your business performance. This process solicits ideas from the workforce, tests the practical, fast, and cost-free ideas and then implements the winners. Finally, there is a common sense approach to process improvement that the entire organization can use.Thanks to Dr. Holland for writing this eye-opening book."
5,Relaxing!,Fantastic music for relaxation! Highly recommend for spas! Nice even tones with great smooth flowing rhythm.
3,Too few quotes,"This book describes the building of IBM under Thomas Watson Sr. who grew it from a small struggling company to an international powerhouse. The book also describes many personal aspects of Watson's life.The source material for the book includes extensive transcripts of Watson's meetings and talks which was then condensed in the biographer's narrative style, often with small interludes of what the weather was like or how people's faces looked or how they were dressed or what they must have been feeling. Only rarely does the book print Watson's words in verbatim even though the biographer had access to vast amounts of raw Watson transcripts.While the book does give some interesting insight into the evolution of computers and its related business, and the personal and family sacrifices that comes with being a man like Watson, the book only gives a watered down interpretation of Watson's mindset because of its lack of quotes. For this reason I have only rated it at 3 stars."
2,This Electric Youth Needs a Jolt,"The art is the reason to purchase this, if indeed you do. Oeming works in black-and-white Mignola territory here. And occasionally the script spins a nice turn of phrase or matches up effectively with the pretty pictures, in spite of itself.But it tried to hard to be self-consciously arty and poetic. It was like an early Bradbury plot written in late prose, filtered through acid flashbacks -- lyrical but disjointed. I suppose one could argue that it was a success, if it was trying to be dreamlike, but in the light of day a dream still needs to make sense upon interpretation. And this didn't.Can I describe the story? Not so much. A bitter woman, a cuckolded husband, and a neglected daughter. Is she alive, or dead? Is she able to exert influence regardless? Was it a dream? A metaphor? Brought about by a horseshoe to the head? Or ended that way? Let me know if *you* can tell.Look for it in the quarter bin, maybe."
2,Second tape is blank,"I am listening now to Great Expectations, but am stymied because the second tape is blank, with no sound. I will have to find a paper copy in the library and then go back to the third tape. I am reading it in large part because I so appreciate the excellent narration of Frank Muller."
2,Ehhh....?,"I was angry after buying this controller! Now you don't have to listen to me, but it would be wise to! You see this is one of the most expensive controllers for the PS1...I wouldn't waist more money than you have to. buy one of those really cool colored ones, I was much more happier with that one. I think I speak for everyone when I say that the cord is pathetic and tangles really easy. Buy it if you want to buy it... Go for it! I'm just saying I didn't care for it...."
3,Your Average Controller,"The controller fits in your hand but the two joysticks collide and make it hard to go left or right. The cords get tangled up alot. The buttons are way to confusing. On the other hand the controller does provide long-term comfort after using it, it doesn't brake easily like Gamecube controllers. The cords doesn't have two confusing sections like Xbox. Overall it's a 3/5 controller!"
2,Nicely Mixed But Terrible Track Selection,"Though I'm not the biggest fan of the trance genre, I like to listen to a few trance albums now and again in the hope of finding a gem in the rut. Passport to the United States of America by Corsten is no such gem. Ferry's mixing and editing are always excellent (and is again here), but the tracks featured on this album are ordinary or less than ordinary. This mix has nothing standout-ish about it. After a few listens, I was over this album...another dust collector.2.5/5 stars"
2,Blah,I was disappointed with this album. It is more techy and less melodic and trancey as Passport to the Netherlands and Right of Way. Plus I had already heard more interesting versions of the same tracks elsewhere before I got this. I have faith in Ferry and I think he'll surprise us with another great release in the future. Just not this release...
2,Same as MSDN library online or available on CD/DVD,The series of books are pretty much is the MSDN library Jan 2000 Editional. This information is freely aviable on msdn.microsoft.com. The only good thing about it is that it comes with the MSDN Jan 2000 DVD so that you can install the whole library locally on your HD for quick access to library from your development environment. Otherwise the books are just a printout of the networking development section from the MSDN library.
3,"DVD (media) plays great, I just didn't care for the movie","Everything related to the transaction, the quality of the DVD, all good. I just didn't like the movie: the acting is painful to watch, the direction is poor... they spoiled what could have been a good story."
1,Dull attempt to ape Hitchcock's style,"Highly stylized effort at film noir by Kenneth Branagh, matching the tortuously dull love-affair between his private-eye and Thompson's amnesiac with a cliche-ridden attempt at a genre he either misunderstands completely or must secretly loathe. Derek Jacobi is excellent as usual, and the plot does finally gather some pace, but by this time its a question of making the best of a bad job."
2,Well...,"I remember this movie being much more enjoyable in the 80's. The cast is made up of several notable actors, but their fake accents and the script diminish their talents somewhat. The base of the story is really cool and has an interesting plot twist but it cannot make up for the parts that drag along and the bad language."
5,Fascinating,"Great murder mystery. This is one my favorite movies. I have rented it many times and thought it was about time to own it. Every time I watch Dead Again I catch some aspect of the movie that I missed before. It has many twists and turns. Just when you think you have the mystery solved, another character or idea comes into play. All acting is suberb. Kenneth Brannaugh's dual role as an American PI and German conductor is brilliant. The idea of a murder mystery involving reincarnation is fascinating!"
3,Neuvo Drama,This movie stands out for a number of reasons. The method of intermixing black and white and color to show when in time we were was done nicely along with some beautiful camera work. The acting and story is excellent which leads one to wonder why the film didn't receive more recognition. Be sure to at least rent this movie. I think you will see that it is worth adding to anyones DVD collection.
3,Robin Williams' best role,"This movie probably has too many cinema gimmicks to be taken too seriously--Hitchcock, Huston, etc.--but is a lot of fun. Robin Williams' bit part as a defrocked psychiatrist is, I think, his greatest screen part, a completely different characterization as a vengeful, bitter soul. If he could put the same legitimate drama into his other ""serious"" roles, he would really arrive as an actor. Derek Jacobi is always a pleasure to watch, and I think that Emma and Kenneth had some great fun with these roles."
1,Complicated with pointless storylines,I was tod to watch this film from a co-worker and I was jsut dissapointed. I could not believe I wasted almost 2 hours watching this trash. The story was very confusing with it going back and fourth through time. There are many pointless storylines and charactors. The acting is overdone that it's not believable. I like the actors in the film but they where jsit placed in the wrong movie.
3,How funny,"I love this movie. Not because it is really good but because it is really horribly bad. If you don't find the incredibly exaggerated accents funny then maybe the corny lines and hilarious plot will be hysterical. By far the best line has to be ""These are for you!"" in the worst German accent ever. Don't buy it because some great actors are in it, buy it for the laughs."
2,not at Hitchcock's level.,"This movie has a good cast but it is not up to the level like the Hitchcock's movies.I like Emma Thompson and the cast in other movies that were good,but I had a hard time getting into the story.If Alfred Hitchcock was to had seen this movie he may be very angry at the writers and director."
4,Captivating,"Without ovethinking my review, I truly enjoyed this filme both when it first came out and just recently. The past-life angle gives a depth to the story that held me... Recurring romance from life to life. My only complaint is for the final action scene... It is choppy, disjointed, and difficult to take too seriously. I think that whoever was controling the cutting room that day had fallen alseep. But if you can suspend criticism in the moment, this is a very nice flick for you and your special someone to trigger some thoughtful discussion. I liked it enough to add a copy to my library."
5,clever one of a kind reincarnation thriller,"reincarnation, amnesia and a fascination with scissors combine to make this a little known classic. superb acting from british comedian emma thompson and shakespearean actor/director kenneth brannagh. the ending will surprise you."
5,The Walrus,"I have always loved this album. So underrated. So many Beatle albums are good, this one is great. I could listen to this forever, and trust me, I will."
2,"wow, I'm surprised people like this one by the Beatles","The songs for Magical Mystery Tour (the British television special in 1967 as opposed to the singles collected on the CD) are some of the weakest songs the Fab Four ever released. Blue Jay Way is boring, boring, boring and Flying is a throw away piece of filler. The title track and ""Your Mother Should Know"" are terribly written and seem like they were just cranked out in 15 minutes. The only good song on the whole soundtrack is ""Fool on the Hill"" and that pales compared to other songs by Paul such as found on the Revolver CD. The collection of singles on this CD are good. But even songs such as ""All You Need Is Love"" and ""Baby You're a Rich Man"" have fared poorly over the years. While I'm a big, big Beatles fan, even I have to admit when the Beatles made some [low grade music]."
3,good but galaxies away from greatness,"There is little doubt that the beatles wrote a lot of infectious pop tunes but to deify them as THE BEST band of all time as so many do is laughable.The Beatles came along at the right time and place and struck a chord with a mass audience.That does not make them great,however.Their music is thoroughly lightweight-musical popcorn,if you please.Led Zeppelin had soul and emotion and great musicianship.The Stones had it all for the first ten or twelve years.Blach Sabbath had a depth and guitar playing second to none.Metallica with Cliff Burton was untouchable.To hear ""Call of Ktulu"" or ""Orion"" is to know The Beatles just aren't in the same league with the true greats.A hundred years from now The Beatles will be little more than a footnote in the annals of music.This album is pretty good.If quaint and occasionally charming featherweight tunes are your thing then this album is as good as any.Have a nice day!"
2,For Beatles fans and old hippies,"I had to have this because, well, it's the Beatles! Surely not their best, but part of their whole saga."
1,I got a headache listening to this,"After listening to the Magical Mystery Tour, I got a headache.Gosh already, I am sooooooo sick of the Beatles.Are people in a time warp? This is 2005, the people are passé.Sorry Beatles lovers, that is the reality, they are so very passé."
1,BORING,"This CD is totally boring, even when ""Penny Lane"" comes along to ""pick things up"", 'cause by the time ""Penny Lane"" comes along, I'm already so down and out b/c of how boring the previous tracks are, ""Penny Lane"" just isn't much; I like music from all decades and the '60's is no exception. But what the heck is so great about this CD? Nothing."
1,Boring,"The Beatles were so overhyped. This album doesnt Stand a chance over any 80s or 90s Rolling Stone album. Buy something from the Stones please and Avoid Listning to Corny songs Like ""All You need Is love"" because That's Not true."
1,I am tired of the beatles,"Everywhere I go, I hear how good the beatles were and I see them as nothing but a 60s version of the Backstreet boys."
5,The Beatles' best album.,"This is by far the Beatles best album. I like it becausethe band plays together well and they all seem to be onthe same page. Unlike ""Sgt.Pepper"" which has a song abouta circus right before a song about eastern religion.Furthermore they used the sound effects more sparingly andquite a bit more carefully and thoughtfully too, unlike thestrange-noise-laden fare on ""Sgt.Pepper"". The effects reallyadd to the weird atmosphere and all the music seems strangelyconnected. A real gem!!!"
4,Some of their best and worst,"Three of my all time favourite Beatle tracks are here: Strawberry fields,all you need is love and walrus. I think these are the best Lennon songs from the Beatles. Each one of these songs could have a monument built in every city in the world. Unfortunately, some of their worst songs are also here. Blue jay way is a boring indian type of thing, flying is an instrumental jam to fill a space in the album, and Your mother should know is the worst Beatle song ever, its ridiculous. If you want to start a Beatle collection, buy this after peper, abbey rd, white album, revolver, rubber soul and help."
5,The Magical Mystery Tour is coming to take you away...,"Not my personal favorite Beatle's album, but includes some of my favorite songs. The strongest tracks are ""Strawberry Fields"", ""I am the Walrus"",""The Fool on the Hill"", and ""Hello Goodbye"", but that's not saying that the others aren't any good. Even the weakest tracks like ""Blue Jay Way"" and ""Flying"" are still very acceptable. Fitting right in with the phscidelic era and ""The Summer of Love"", this album is a must for people who like good music."
3,"Update on boxed set, 'Magical Mystery Tour'","I seem to be one of the few lucky people whose 2012 Deluxe Boxed Set is free fromwarps, scratches, etc. And, for the most part, the albums sound great. But afterrepeated listenings of MMT, even with the sound way up, it seems that the voicesare suppressed, or pushed into the background. I really wanted to hear Paul'svoice explode from the speakers on 'Hello Goodbye' but it doesn't quite seemto. Close, but not quite. Wish I had an original MMT vinyl album to compare it to!"
4,One Of their More Underrated Albums.,"Magical Mystery Tour is Sgt. Pepper taken to the next level, more psychedelic and unique but still not as enjoyable. Some of them are actually leftovers but still good songs. personally, I'm not a big fan of Strawberry fields or I Am The Walrus but the other hits like Fool On the Hill, Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane and the title track are great. Then there's my personal favorite, Blue Jay Way. It's not essential in my opinion but if you're more than just a casual fan of The Beatles than it's worth buying and mostly solid throughout."
2,Mystery to Me,There is a maximum of 3 or 4 good songs on this album and it is generally recognized as being one of the Beatles' weakest. Anyone who thinks that all of the tracks are good needs to listen to some more music!
5,EXCELLENT,"I found the Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour to be one of the best CD's that I have ever listened to. It has great hits such as Magical Mystery Tour, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and All You Need Is Love. It also has some great songs that I never heard like Your Mother Should Know."
5,Amazing washes of sound,"""Magical Mystery"" is a collection of film music that far exceeds the film itself, with the most brilliant singles ever recorded tacked on for good measure. The last of the Beatles' great psychedelic ventures should never be dismissed as merely trippy, for it is intelligent, carefully renedered, and highly imaginative work that shows what levels of art pop music can rise to. I miss this experimental studio attitude, coupled as it was with accessible songs and lyrics chock full of double meanings. And, in contrast to the rampant cynicism of today, ""All You Need Is Love"" remains a triumph."
3,Taking the good with the bad,"Worthwhile for John Lennon's contributions, of course, as well as ""Penny Lane"", one of Paul McCartney's best songs from that period. The rest of McCartney's songs are lightweight pop. Harrison's contribution, ""Blue Jay Way"", is an unmitigated bore; George repeatedly sings ""Please don't be long"", but unfortunately doesn't take his own advice. Finally, the instrumental ""Flying"" is an utter throwaway."
5,classic,"This cd has some tracks I had not heard before ,it is a very good recording with orchestral backing.This was not played very much on commercial radio,it even has a instrumental track which I really like."
5,"Great, of Course","It always provokes a little bit of humor and a little bit of chagrin when various parties publish ""Top 500 Albums of All Time"" or whatever, lists, and include one or two of the Beatles' albums but not the rest. Why don't they be honest and include them all?The Beatles had an unprecedented opportunity to produce greatness, and an unprecedented sense of responsibility towards it. Although their first few albums may sound a little unsophisticated (and don't forget they 'invented' sophistication, along with a few others), the rest are just inpeccableNothing really exceeds Magical Mystery Tour. Made just before the universally-beloved-by-critics Sergeant Pepper, it contains some of their most effort-filled and most inspired songs. ""Penny Lane"", ""Strawberry Fields"", the opening theme, ""I Am the Walrus"" and several others are a part of not just Western culture but of world culture as well.The remastering sounds wonderful."
4,The best of the Beatles studio CD's,This is my favorite of the Beatles Studio CD not counting any of their compliations or anthologies. A solid outing that finds them in between stages. Not too psychidelic but not as stale as say a Hard Day's Night.Bottom Line: A Classic of course.
5,Skip The Fool,"The best way to listen to this stellar album, one of my favorite Beatles' LPs,(got it for Christmas on vinyl in 1967) is to SKIP TRACK TWO!Much as I love Paul, this way maintains the vibe. Try it, Beatle people..."
3,Just not a big favorite ...,"Of all the Beatles' albums I own, this one is least frequently in the CD changer. I do like the title cut, and ""I Am The Walrus,"" but the rest of the tracks don't do much for me. This album feels almost as disjointed as the movie for which it serves as soundtrack. I think it's an important piece to have in terms of fleshing out a collection, but not one that is particularly dear to me."
5,Genius Salad,"Brilliance and greatness. Even ""throw-away"" tunes like ""Baby You're a Rich Man"" (which I love) are great. ""Hello Goodbye"" is the weakest track on the album (other than ""Flying"")"
5,A fabulous album!,"The ""Magical Mystery Tour"" album is the one best things to come out of Capitol Record's method to releasing Beatle LP's (as most know, they sliced songs off of the British albums in order to get more product out of what was recorded, so ""With The Beatles"" magically becomes ""Meet The Beatles"" and ""Second Album"" with a few hit singles added in). Since this soundtrack was only originally released in the UK as an EP, and as that format would not sell in the U.S. Capitol added their hit '67 singles to the B-side of the film soundtrack to make a full-fledged, and now well accepted, album. It features such groud breaking hits as ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Penny Lane,"" as well as some songs that could have been singles themselves, such as ""The Fool On The Hill"". A must have for every Beatles fan (as are all of their albums). My favorite track - ""I Am The Walrus""."
3,no matter what,"no matter what people say, this record makes me throw up.Its vengeful lunacy is superfluos and empty and furthermoar BEST AVOIDED.Love, ben"
3,"It,s the Beatles","The album has some great songs, but the influence of drugs is definatly in the works especially in Johns life. Hello Goodby, Pennly Lane, walrus all classics. The drug ara is my least favirote part of the Beatles simple put there bad for you. GodBless"
5,This isn't really a Beatle's album but it's a nice collection of psychedelic rock,"I love Magical Mystery Tourbut I don't really consider it an album just because of the fact that it has a bunch of their singles on it ... That being said,this is a great collection of later Beatles....I'd buy it even if you allready have Penny Lane, I am The Walrus, Strawberry Fields, and All You Need Is Love because the other tracks (i.e. Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know...etc...) are way more than filler"
5,Psychedelic nursery rhymes and peace anthems.,"For my money, ""I Am The Walrus"" is one of the best tunes ever recorded, period. It, along with several of the other tracks--""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""Fool on the Hill"", in particular-- are like a Lewis Carroll ""Alice in Wonderland"" journey, with Lennon's jabberwocked tongue placed firmly in cheek. I've always said that most Brits have that nasty/perverse-prep school thing that they never quite outgrow....anyhow, listen, if you will, to the detail in Harrison's ""Blue Jay Way"". Fabulous. Thank you, gentlemen for a great ride!"
5,"A betles album, it must be good",The beatles are the best thing in music. By any cd and you will know that to
5,The best beatle work!!!,"Great album, great songs! I highly recommend it to any, and i mean any person who enjoys music, no matter if he likes soul, pop, classic, country, etc. It is worth having it!!! STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER is propably the best of all the good songs in this album. It is really catchy and is considered one of the best songs ever written!"
4,Excellent Beatles psychadelia compilation.,"As you probably know, the first six tracks are from the Beatle movie and the latter five are non-album singles from the era. And this makes Magical Mystery Tour a rather strange listen; the first half (except for the title track, maybe Fool On The Hill, and obviously I Am The Walrus) is basically Beatles-by-numbers and feels like somewhat of a waste of time.But the second half is better than most bands' greatest hits compilations, and this more than makes up for the (relative) filler on the first half. And this makes for a very enjoyable listen.Should you get it? Of course. Although this isn't a proper album, I Am The Walrus, Strawberry Fields Forever, and Penny Lane are unquestionably some of *the* best songs of all time; and Hello Goodbye and All You Need Is Love are easily 5-star songs. If you have the Blue Album though, you can easily skip this and not really miss a step as 7 of these 11 tracks appear on there."
5,Good,I had bought this for my husband. He is a fan of their music. It brought back many good memories or him.
5,CLASSIC ALBUM! GREAT VINYL!!,Best Xmas gift I've ever received. This album is amazing ! Every song is fantastic! The record sounds amazing! Great price too! Awesome buy! Must have for a Beatles fan!
5,MILES OF ENTERTAINMENT,"I HAVE MOST OF THE BEATLES ON LP'S - BUT NOW THAT I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN, I GO FOR DAILY WALKS & TAKE MY ""CD"" WALKMAN WITH ME, THE BEATLES MAKE WALKING A ""BREEZE"" BY ENTERTAINING ME! GLAD YOU ARE AROUND AMAZON!!!!!!"
3,Capitol Always Butchered the Beatles,"If you like listening to singles, disregard what I have to say.Capitol's track lineup is silly. I used iTunes and reoriented the original tracks in the order of the British 2EP release (see wikipedia's Magical Mystery Tour article). I then inserted the singles in where I thought they were most appropriate (""Baby You're a Rich Man"" opens side 2, ""Hello, Goodbye"" opens side 3, ""All You Need is Love"" opens side 4). Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane belong on Sgt. Pepper's - leave them off of this album. (after trying nearly every possible combination, I found it most sensible to have Strawberry close side one of Pepper's and have Penny Lane between Within You and Sixty-Four)Like I said, I think Capitol butchered this album and ruined its flow. Why they felt the need to reorient Side 1 is beyond me."
3,Come on...,"I am a great Beatles fan,but this is much less than their other LPs.1. Magical Mystery Tour - a nice song. 7/102. Fool on the Hill- Good McCartney ballad. 7/103. Flying - An instrumental 5/104. Blue Jay Way - nothing expecial 6/105. Your Mother Should Know - Old style fun 6/106. I Am the Walrus - Great 9/107. Hello Goodbye - Overrated 5/108. Strawberry Fields Forever- A MASTERPIECE 10/109. Penny Lane - Great 8/1010. Baby You're a Rich Man 5/1011. All You Need Is Love - Overrated 6/10"
3,"Great songs, reasonable album",Magical Mystery Tour is an album featuring 11 great Beatles songs. But the problem is few of these songs sound as if they belong on the same album together.
2,Not Quite There,"This CD falls a little short of what I expected, as songs like Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, and the Fool on the Hill are simply not up to the standard Beatle quality.Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields are good, but those can be bought on some of the hits compilations like Past Masters or 1967-1970.I give one star each for the hits, but that's it."
2,Magical Mystery Tour,"This is the one with Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and a host of other mediocre songs on it. Pass on this one."
3,Not the sonic difference I was expecting...,"Let's not get too excited here, folks. There is not a lot of difference in these ""remastered"" albums than the ones previously available.These reviews should be primarily about what the sound difference is in these newly released albums, not the album itself. I bought Magical Mystery Tour and The Beatles Past Masters and I am disappointed in both. Can you hear things in Magical Mystery Tour that you couldn't hear before? A bit, but nothing remarkable. They are also bass deficient on some cuts which I thought would be eliminated. And I'm not listening to these on a Mickey Mouse stereo either- a Bryston amp & preamp, Snell speakers & a Meridian cd player.Who are these people absolutely gushing over these remastered albums?????? There is very little difference in these newly reissued albums. Always take a review, any review, with a grain of salt."
2,Magical Mystery Tour,"Similar to other Beatle releases of the 65-67 period, MMT has a few good songs, but more forgettable ones. The three notable songs on this release (Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, and All You Need is Love) can be obtained on numerous greatest hits compilations."
3,THE MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR IS IN BETWEEN,"i KIND OF LIKE THIS cd. I only like Penny Lane and Hello, Goodbye since they are the two songs that I know the best. I would say it is alright. E-mail me at thebeatlefantanya@yahoo.com"
3,WAHHHH WAHH WAHH WAH WAHHHHHHHHHHHH,"I really enjoy this cd. I think it's underrated, and there are some great songs in it:Hello Goodbye, Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know, Penny Lane...and then there's All You Need is Love. All You Need is Love has a lot going for it: nice instrumentation going in, beautiful harmonies, a great message. But then the elephant strikes. During the chorus every time after they say ""All you need is love,"" there's some circus-inspired tuba elephant noise, that does nothing but detract from the song. It breaks the soothing quality of the singing with a jarring elephant noise that gets progressively more irritating as the song goes on. It really bothers me."
2,It's OK.,"For one thing, two of the songs were released before Pepper. Flying is annoying. Your Mother is just this annoying jingle. Hello Goodbye is catchy and bad. Like commercial songs. The title track sounds like tripped-out military band music. The rest is fine."
1,The worst,"This CD sucks. I don't like it at all. I'm a HUGE Beatles fan, but this one doesn't pass. Buy Sgt. Pepper, the best album ever made."
1,Magical Mystery Tour,Magical Mystery Tour - 6/10The Fool On the Hill - 0/10Flying - 0/10Blue Jay Way - 0/10Your Mother Should Know - 0/10I Am the Walrus - 4/10Hello Goodbye - 7/10Strawberry Fields Forever - 3/10Penny Lane - 6/10Baby Your A Rich Man - 0/10All You Need is Love - 6/10This really should have been 2 singles:Side A: All You Need is Love / Side B: Penny LaneSide A: Hello Goodbye / Side B: Magical Mystery Tour
1,Mystery Tour,"Fool on the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know....are there 4 worse consecutive songs on any other Beatle album?Well, Rubber Soul tries (Think for Yourself, The Word, Michelle, What Goes On) and Revolver makes a run at it (Eleanor Rigby, Love You To, I'm Only Sleeping, Here There & Everywhere) as well as the White Album (Piggies, Rocky Racoon, Don't Pass Me By and Why Don't We Do It in the Road), but Mystery Tour is likely the worst.Buy the various greatest hits compilations, which enable you to hear songs like Magical Mystery Tour and Strawberry Fields without having the lesser tracks."
1,It's just Silly!,"You may have heard the redneck banter of my brother and cousin Dufus; It is for this reason and the excessive silliness of this album that I must deliver a Tirade the likes of which have never before been seen on the Internet! Just look at the cover of the album? What the hell have they got all over their faces, hmm? They need to clean up their act, that's what. Look at the song titles! Magical Mystery Tour? Pah! do they think everyone who listens to music is a teenybopper who can be wooed by pretty colors? Pah again! Dufus is a disgrace to the Radwick family name! I hope no one sees his horrendus review of Help!"
1,Magical Mystery Mediocrity,"""Mind altering music""....yeah sure, believe what you want. And exactly what is the ""phycadelia"" regarding I Am the Walrus? One of the worst albums of 1967. Easily."
1,Magical Mystery Tour,"Horns, flutes, instrumentals and bad vocals. How can one resist? There are lots of descriptives of this album, but ""masterpiece"" isn't one of them.The title song starts off with potential, but fades quickly, and most of the rest of the record is pretty forgettable, especially Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love which sound very outdated."
1,Ugh,"Many of the beatles albums now sound dated in my opinion, and none more so than MMT. The sonic improvement can only go so far in improving the hopelessly out of date music. I am the Walrus, indeed."
5,Underrated,"This album is often referred to as a bunch of hit singles but I disagree. It starts with an intro song practically copying the Sgt. Pepper beginning. Instead of the album being a show, it's a tour or trip(Paul was on an acid trip when he got the idea for the album. Surprise, surprise.) The body is simply fantastic. Song after song is brilliant. ""Hello, Goodbye"", ""Strawberry Fields, Forever,"" ""Penny Lane"" etc. It's nicely concluded with the Beatles timeless, despite being in the hippie era, saying ""All You Need is Love.""""Blue Jay Way"" and ""Flying"" are mediocre, not bad but mediocre. All the rest are five star songs. One of the few albums that can boast this for me. As good as Revolver or Pepper."
2,"Incredible Music, Poor Packaging","This contains some of the greatest music of all time, especially in the form of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""I Am The Walrus"". However, compared to the original lavish LP packaging, the CD packaging is a mere shadow. Capitol should upgrade this CD and include the original packaging elements as well as perhaps some background information about this important music."
2,Magical Mystery Tour,"The Fool on the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and Baby You're a Rich Man. Not exactly ""classic song after classic song"". 2 stars."
4,Excelent------------Superb-------------2 flaws,"I gave this album 4 stars because of 2 flaws- Blue Jay Way and Flying. Those are the most stupid songs I've ever heard. I'm a very extended Beatles fan and collector. In all the records and CDs I have, there is nothing more stupid than those two songs. Every thing else is excelent-------superb!I suggest you bye this for all the other songs, Magical Mystery Tour, Fool on the Hill, Your Mother Should Know, I am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Baby Your a Rich Man ,and All you need is love."
1,Check the Track Listing,"Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're A Rich Man. Did the group just not try to write a complete album or were they out of ideas? The so-called better tracks, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fiels suffer from Paul's lightweight writing and John's nasally singing - ""Straw Berry Fieeeelds For Eveh..""Ugh.Who knows, but it sure doesn't stand up to anything before or after its release. Anyone who rates this 5-stars is simply swept up in the Beatles. They can't be listening to the music."
1,Buy Beatles 1,"The three number one singles that anchor this burst of brilliance can be obtained on Beatles 1, enabling the listener to avoid the likes of Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, and on and on...."
1,"Highly, Highly Overrated","Wow. It is very difficult to find strong songs on this album. Out of 12 tracks there are only four of note: Magical Mystery Tour, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane. Songs like Your Mother Should Know and Flying are truly throwaways.These strong tracks from MMT should have been put on the Sgt. Pepper album instead of junk like When I'm 64 and Within You Without You. That would have been a 5-star album."
1,Magical Mystery Tour,The cover depicts people disguised as animals. The album contains lite pop disguised as rock music. Neither disguise works very well.
5,It's Your Invitation,"Great album. Haven't heard some of the songs in years. The album is shorter than I realized. On cd you can pick up nuances like the line ""I'll stay until it's time to go"" on Hello Goodbye. Get it."
5,I Told You About Strawberry Fields...,"This CD is something of a paradox. This contains some of their most majestic songs that they've ever made (Strawberry Fields, I Am The Walrus) on one hand. On the other, it was intended by Capitol to be a package containing the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack and some of their recent singles that had not yet shown up on album format. In CD form, it still is found lacking. The original album booklet appears in a much truncated form. Also, the sound could use some upgrading, perhaps in a similar way to the recent Yellow Submarine songtrack. They might wish to add some bonus tracks, as there are other versions of I Am The Walrus, Penny Lane, etc, that are known to exist. I grade this CD 5 stars on the basis of Strawberry Fields Forever alone, one of the greatest songs ever written by John Lennon. Goo goo g'joob."
4,Magical!,"Not a concept album like Pepper, and more like a compilation (side two) of their 1967 period slapped onto an EP (side one being a soundtrack of the BBC television flop).Best of includes -The Fool On The Hill, Blue Jay Way and I Am The Walrus from side one, andStrawberry Fields Forever/Penny LaneBaby You're A Rich Man/All You Need Is Lovefrom side two.Lesser lights include -Magical Mystery Tour, Our Mother Should Know and Hello Goodbye (the latter a big hit in 1967, side A to Walrus).Oh yeah, the original LP (album) had this neat technicolor comic book insert, too, and the album cover is rather neat to look at and guess who is who (Lennon, who sings I Am the Walrus (goo goo joo boo), sings in Glass Onion that the walrus was Paul, just to keep things bizarre)."
5,Underrated and WAY superior to Revolver or Sgt Pepper,"Magical Mystery Tour is definitely the Beatles' masterpiece. All of their other albums (except for Abbey Road) have some inferior or throw-away tracks, but this one is perfect. It's so underrated!! ...."
3,"Good, but not great","I've loved The Beatles since I was 8 years-old, but have to admit that I think this is the weakest of their later albums. There are a few great moments (I Am the Walrus, Strawberry Fields) but there are a lot of mediocre songs too. Many of the songs strike me as superficial -- A Fool on the Hill has a nice melody but is too pedestrian; the title track isn't even a complete song, etc. And I think the album's production is too schmaltzy, a classic example of late '60s excess."
5,Full of Phantasmagoric Splendor!,"Hehe, okay, I know that's Monkees (""Daily Nightly""), not Beatles, but so what? It describes this album perfectly. Beautifully put together, with a great song list. I enjoyed every song on the album, though I found ""I am the Walrus"" to be rather, um, unusual . . ."
2,Some Classics,"Released in between Sgt. Pepper (summer 1967) and ""The Beatles"" (1968), this CD offers 4 songs that fall into the category of memorable Beatle classics - Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love. The rest are songs that were used to create an EP in addition to these popular singles. An alternative approach would have been to include these songs on Sgt. Pepper in place of Within You Without You or She's Leaving Home, which would have made Pepper a bit of a better album. Not a ""must have"" for Beatle fans, but OK."
2,Unbiased Review - Magical Mystery Tour,"""Imagine"" if All You Need Is Love, Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields had been subbed into Sgt. Pepper in place of the goofy Mr. Kite, the horrid Within You Without You, and the lackluster Fixing A Hole and When I'm 64. That would have been an album.The reality is that the four good songs on Mystery Tour just can't overcome the likes of Blue Jay Way, Flying or Your Mother Should Know.Nevetheless, I rate this 2 stars because of the strength of the 4 best songs."
4,As underrated as can be.,"People,we agree that the Beatles put out a bunch of good if not great albums.Even though the second side is a 1967 singles compilation,this album should be no exception.""I Am The Walrus"",""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""All You Need Is Love"" are classic John Lennon.""Hello Goodbye"",""The Fool On The Hill"" and ""Penny Lane"" are classic Paul McCartney.You add ""Flying"" and the title track and you have 37 minutes of great Beatles music.Almost every album that I've encountered had some amount of filler and MMT is no exception.This album's filler track:""Blue Jay Way""...yuck!"
5,Holy crap... it's neato.,"This album is absolutely awesome. And neato. I like to listen to it lots. This has got to be my favorite Beatles album. Every song is perfect, specifically ""Blue Jay Way"" and ""I Am the Walrus"". These are awesome songs. Everyone should own this album, because it is really cool. So, duh."
2,Intriguing but shallow,"Brevity is a virtue, but Langer's explanations fall well short of showing the reader how to apply the techniques of systems analysis.The chapters are in the sequence neither of the chronology of systems analysis tasks nor or the order of presentation in systems analysis deliverables. Each chapter is like a separate out-of-context article.Langer steers a balanced course between competing methogologies, pointing out, as few other books do, that we should integrate the principles of object-oriented analysis into the proven framework of structured analysis. Much of what's here is good, but there isn't enough of it.I recommend The Art of Analysis for supplementary reading by the experienced systems analyst, but not as a textbook from which to learn systems analysis."
4,"A good, brief introductory coverage of analysis","This is a good, brief introduction to the topic of systems analysis. The thing that I like best about this book is that it hits on most of the major topics related to analysis in about 150 pages. This is a small, compact book that I was able to read in a couple hours (and I consider myself a slow reader). This makes this a good introduction to the topic and a decent reference as well. In my opinion, the major thing that keeps this book from being a five star book is the fact that information was not presented in a fashion that I believe would easily lend itself as a guide on real life projects. I would have liked to have seen more chapter summaries that described suggested inputs, processes, and outputs through the life cycle of a project."
3,Am I the only one not mesmerized by this album?,"I count Lifted as one of my Top Five Desert Island albums, have whiled away many a leafy afternoon with I'm Wide Awake, and was looking forward to Cassadaga.However, I find it to be lacking in the spontaneity and sound of feeling that he's given in his earlier works. Maybe he's not as angst-filled as he once was. Anyway, this album seems too polished, too boring sounding, even the lyrics leave me cold.I give it three stars because it's a technically good album, but no more because I honestly haven't listened to it since the first few go rounds. Maybe it will be plundered for mix fodder, there are a few enjoyable tracks to pull out.Let's hope he stops overproducing on the next offering."
5,"Bright Eyes' Best, Deepest Album Yet","I've listened to the CD somewhere between 25 and 30 times, and I've yet to tire of it. ""Cleanse Song"" is probably my favorite; ""Brakeman"" ""Classic Cars"" are close seconds. Also, I used ""Four WInds"" in a religion project, mainly to piss off my fanatically Catholic teacher.Things I noticed about the album: Bright Eyes' voice sounds clearer; he is more articulate now than in any previous album...The lyrics are more mature than before...The songs have a gentler feel, probably because the style strays more toward country than before"
5,Cassadaga by Bright Eyes,"This is a very good CD. I had some difficulty getting used to the intro on the CD, but I'm getting more used to it now with each listening. I like the arrangement and enjoy hearing his unique voice."
4,Grew on me.,"This album has more of a country feel than the older ones. I was not that into it at first, most musically and lyrically (Which is really Bright Eyes' strong point)....but I have to say, after awhile, it grew on me. Now I like it quite a bit for background. I must say though that I love it much more than the solo Conor Oberst album."
3,3 1/2 stars for this Country Lifting,"I like this album. It's a little lengthy, but Bright Eyes is one of those artists that doesn't waste the minutes he uses.I don't like it as well as everybody else who has reviewed it though. I read, somewhere, of this album that it doesn't quite have the angst of his previous albums. I think that's pretty accurate, and maybe that's because he's outgrown his angst years, I don't know. What I do know is that for me, this album lacked that sense of urgency that have been on his other albums, that sense of ""this might kill me if I don't get it out and sing about it."" That's not on this album.However, Casadaga is full of good songs. I am quite fond of ""Soul Singer in a Session Band.""I don't know if he'll ever top ""I'm Wide Awake it's Morning."""
5,wonderful,"Cal Tjader's music is wonderful, It's music to dance by or just sitting with a glass of wine while listing to his music. I am so glad Amazon carries these oldies but goodies. Thank You Amazon"
1,should be more like zero stars,I bought this book thinking it was going to be a great read. But Boy was I disappointed. I probably didn't read half of the short stories. Not a good read. Save your money and your time.
2,"Needs updated, needs index, needs better organization","As a Perl programmer I often need to look up a word or command to see how it is used. This reference makes it tough because it is organized by categories, instead of alphabetically. So if you're not sure what a command does - you'll look forever trying to find it. The book could also use a highlighted index along the side of the book like ""Perl in a Nutshell"" (This is the book you SHOULD get instead). They should expand the reference to include minor examples as well. Out of all the O'Reilly Perl books, this is the one I find myself going to the least - when it should be an indispensible reference..."
4,Pretty good pocket-reference,"At $5-6, this is very affordable and a necessity when you work at more than one location (home and office) but only keep one set of books. Though sometimes cryptic with notations, I find it to be quite complete and easier to use than thumbing through a complete reference book.The book does nothing more than nudge your memory and sometimes show you language features you knew nothing about. For the latter, a complete reference is required to use the feature (or some tedious experimentation). I expect nothing more from a pocket reference.The author has grouped the language components into sections and there is a TOC. However, I would augment the TOC with an index - I tend to use a pocket reference to find a specific item rather than an entire group.I would buy the next edition of the book if it were to contain an index and embolden the function names in certain sections to make scanning the pages a bit easier."
3,Not one of their best Pocket References,"Maybe there is too much to Perl to squeeze into one tiny guide? Maybe Perl can't be organized like that? For whatever reason, I find Learning Perl (another great O'Reilly book) to be the perfect ""Pocket"" reference, even though it's a standard book. This Pocket reference is too small to be of any real use, unlike many of their other Pocket references."
2,"A mnemonic device, nothing more","This book is little more than a list of perl methods to help jog your memory. If you're fluent in perl but sometimes need to remember the name of a method, this book can help you. But you'd better be able to remember the proper syntax on your own, since the book doesn't include it (granted, perl is fluid enough to make that an easy guess too). If you want a language reference, this book isn't it. It's like carrying a set of flash cards. If you don't know it to begin with, this book won't help you learn it. Even as a reference I found it lacking."
2,Sometimes helpful but incomplete,"As the other reviewers mention, the book is poorly organized and lacks an index. Additionally, it is cavalierly incomplete in places. For example, the definition given for ""\n, \r, \f, \t, etc."" is ""have their usual meaning"" (p. 21)."
3,Too pint-sized to be useful,"This reference is perhaps too brief. I find myself skipping it and going straight for Programming Perl. If I need to quickly look up the usage of a function, the Unix man pages are far more useful -- and faster."
2,Only benefit is portability..,"I have yet to find any of the O'Reily reference books to be useful. They are poorly organized, and it's REALLY hard to find answers to quick questions. I LOVE almost all of the reference companion books. I'd say that you should save the dough on this reference and just buy another copy of the ""Perl 5"" camel book unless you're desperate for a more portable size."
3,Only OK,"This book got a little too into the nity gritty details, which made it not as useful for the Perl hacker like myself."
3,Could be much better,"The Perl 5 pocket reference is a nice handy little tool if you are willing to search for things. Unfortunately, the book does not come with such things as an index - a must in reference books.The book is organized by category - not alphabetically, therefore making it harder to find the information in question. If the book included a few examples, an index, and perhaps a different organization scheme, it would be a much better book. Unfortunately it isn't, therefore sending me elsewhere for reference."
1,Useless,"When I got this book about a year or so ago, I was hoping for a handy reference to all of the 'difficult to remember' perl syntax. Specifically a nice reference on regular expressions, formats, common idiomatic programming (e.g.: sorting a hash by key or value), file tests, sprintf formats, etc.Instead you get a terse listing of most perl functions, regardless of if you'd ever use them. No syntactical hints or examples. No hints as to what they do. No hints as to how to accomplish what you want to do.You're better off making your own reference card(s) from a conglomeration of Programming Perl and the Perl Cookbook (both excellent books). Even the online (perldoc) reference is better than this book."
3,"Great service, old technology","I bought this book to get some additional medical terminology for ESL students. The book was in amazingly good shape, considering that it was published in 1992. Of course the technology described is interesting only for historical reasons, but the chapters in the back of the book are still useful for people who hope to become translators of medical documents."
2,Read it a million times,This is a great tool but I really think practice makes perfect. Get this one or get a similar one if you're studying and practice practice practice. I did really like the lay out of this and it was easy to use and keep track of my progress.
4,"Bjork ""It's In Our Hands"" U.K. CD Single Part 1",Comes in a standard jewel case with front insert (folds out to a mini poster of a drawing) but no back insert.1. It's In Our Hands: good song from the Greatest Hits album.2. Cocoon (Retangled by Ensemble): great re-working of the song EXCEPT for the intro which is just a MINUTE of the same noises over and over. They could have reduced the intro to about 10 seconds and it would have been less annoying.3. All Is Full Of Love (Live): The reasong to get this CD. Sounds amazing live.
5,Stunning,"Paco is as close to being a god as any man can be. There is no guitarist who can better Paco, and this album is well worth more than its price. As a bass player, I have to say that bassist Carles Benevant who Paco used on this album, and who I wish had been used more often, is very nearly as stunning in his style and abilities. You can find Carles on a few tracks on ""Entre Los Aguas"" also."
2,Paco Has Changed,"I am fimiliar with Paco's style, purely instrumental and thought that I would be receiving an instrumental piece, however, since Paco made this, I am sure he knows his new, younger audience."
4,Jarrow Products,"This is the first purchase of Jarrow products for me. So far, I am pleasantly impressed with the quality and price."
5,Now that's more like it...,"Forget that other movie...TORA! TORA! TORA! is the only authentic, historical recreation of the events of December 7, 1941. There's no need for a silly love triangle or Jon Voight behind a prosthetic mask. Just the facts and a fair account of events from both sides of the Pacific. Imagine that! A film that shows you both sides of the coin. I am continually amazed that this film was ever released in the United States, where we don't like to think of our enemies (or former enemies) as human beings with real concerns and conflicting motives.Be forewarned though. Some of the dialogue in this film is quite awkward due to the need to tell a complex story within the framework of the film. You'll hear two sailors on deck casually talking about carrier movements as if they were reciting a highschool history essay."
4,A Slow Moving Film With Great Special Effects,"TORA,TORA,TORA is an entertaining movie for those who are interested in the history of World War II and particularly the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It is mostly a slow moving film which finally explodes with vivid action scenes featuring excellent special effects. The large cast includes a mixture of American and Japanese actors led by Martin Balsam, Soh Yamamura, Joseph Cotton, Tatsuya Mihashi, E.G. Marshall and Takshiro Tamura.The movie received an Academy Award for Best Special Effects and was nominated for Best Cinematography, Art Direction, Editing and Sound. The main competition for Oscars in 1970 came from PATTON starring George C. Scott."
3,Tora! Tora! Tora! - Blu-ray,"A troubled production and a flop at the box office, Tora! Tora! Tora! certainly can't count lack of ambition as one of its faults. A history lesson come to life, the film dramatized the attack on Pearl Harbor from both the American and Japanese perspectives; while I like its commitment to historical accuracy, I feel the film lacked dramatic heft. The American scenes were directed by Hollywood pro Richard Fleischer, but it was the Japanese scenes that caused headaches for the producers; originally, Akira Kurosawa was to direct, but he backed out, only to be replaced by action director Toshio Masuda and future Battle Royale helmer Kinji Fukasaku. With a cast that includes Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, and Jason Robards, as well as Kurosawa and Ozu players So Yamamura and Eijiro Tono, the new Tora! Tora! Tora! Blu-ray is a great stocking stuffer for military buffs on your holiday shopping list."
3,"tora, tora, tora","it's not a bad film, but why would amazon list kurosawa as one of the directors when none of the scenes he shot were in the final film?"
5,The ONLY Pearl Harbor movie worth seeing.,"Without the benefit of todays technology, the producers of this movie have created the perfect re-creation of this episode of American history.The movie follows the book very faithfully. The scenes are beautiflly recreated with some special effects that stand up under the micro-scope of todays tough standards.I recomend this very highly, and now owning both the VHS and DVD versions have to confess that I have watched both many times with great pleasure."
3,few pages and an inappropriate place to place the disk.,"few pages and an inappropriate place to place the disk. the product arrived wrinkled because it was not placed in appropriate container, which was already in a book."
3,we bombed in hawaii,"the telling of the pearl harbor attack from both american and japanese points of view, this movie was an odd egg in war-weary 1970. the american story was directed by legendary hollywood hack richard fleischer, and the japanese story is vastly more compelling -- putting us (the american audience) in the bizarre spot of *sorta* rooting for the japanese attackers. now while this had been a conscious decision on the part of stanley kubrick in ""dr strangelove"" (making us identify with the flight crew about to begin ww3), in this case it was an example of flawed moviemaking. (we can only dream of what this movie might have been had kurosawa not been fired as co-director in the early stages). still, the action sequences are quite exciting, and its sure as heck a better movie than ""pearl harbor""."
4,Put the reviews in the correct place!,"The June 13,2001 review by Fat Joe Tomas is clearly talking about the new flick ""Pearl Harbor"" and not ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" Joe is correct in his comments. The new film is more a fairy tale, not a decent comment on the battle like the classic ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""."
5,Buy this film today!,The movie ia a truly remarkable work. It allows us to see the viewpoints of both the Americans and Japanese with a high degree of historical accuracy. Its good to see all the military blunders and various levels of incompentence by both politicians and military officials in the film. I say this because in a number of World War II films we are only allowed to see the Axis powers behave like bumbling idiots. The film would be a great addition to any video library and teachers would find it useful to show to their students.
4,Tora Tora Tora vs. Pearl Harbor,"To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and as a collector of films with a WW2 genre, I purchased both Tora Tora Tora and Pearl Harbor. While the former was released in 1970, and did not have the luxury of computerized graphics, it told an extremely accurate and very real account of the attack. Completely void of a useless love story, it concentrated solely on historical facts. ""Pearl Harbor"", on the other hand, was pure junk with its opening 55 minutes, which made the film almost laughable and totally forgettable. The unnecessary addition of the Doolittle raid on Tokyo was another poor excuse to show off the use of computerized graphics. Tora Tora Tora, put a luster on the ""Pearl"" while Pearl Harbor, the movie, left it faded and blurred."
3,BLU-Ray review? Where? and...why criticise the Japanes for FDR's plan?,"I'm really sorry for Bowen's characterization of the Pearl Harbor attack as an unwarranted ""sneak attack"". In the first place, FDR manuvered (forced?) Japan into action and in the second place, I think we stopped ""warning"" the enemy of attacks in 1500 when the English kings would parlay with their opposition to decide when the ""mutual"" attack was to take place. I think we were actually very fortunate that the attack was a ""surprise"" and our ships hadn't put to sea. they would have still been sunk...but this time in 1200' of water instaed of 42'. Modern warfare is not enhanced by ""early warnings"". They would just be stupid.And, I just ordered this Blu-Ray version since it has to be better than the original. I got ""Jaws"" in Blu-Ray and it's like looking through a window. If ""Tora Tora, Tora"" is half as good, it must be exceptional!"
5,A surprisingly enjoyable film,"I purchased and watched this film for a class project, so I can say I didn't really want to watch it. It was a of course, not the best quality film in the world, but this didn't keep me from being engrossed in the story very quickly. I'm sure there is a certain amount of Hollywood liberal story interpretation, but the story seemed to be pretty spot on with the history from class. It actually peaked my interest and lead to a WWII film viewing session."
2,Botched transfer,The blu ray is underwhelming to say the least. It is no improvement over DVD played with upscaling.Grain...lots of it as if you are looking through constant haze.Poorly placed subtitles ruin the picture.Pass on this blu ray.
4,A Balanced Treatment of the Pearl Harbor Attack,"This film combines the fun and excitement of a hollywood thriller with the accuracy of a documentary. It is memorable, well acted and superbly directed."
5,The speech of Mr.Hull and the Japanese Ambassador's face at the end...,"Never have i been affected by a war movie so much.Not even Pearl Harbor (the weepy love story) or even Longest Day.The haunting, beautiful music, the silent ecstasy of the Japanese, their anger in Yamamoto not following up with a 2nd attack, the silent agony of the American Decoder who knows they are going to attack, the urgent need for recognizing the significance of 1 PM in the message not yet arrived, the last speech of Yamamoto as he says nothing infuriates the Americans more than unannounced attack, his loneliness as he wanders out of his Flagship alone knowing he has sowed the wind and will be reaping the whirlwind.This is a movie far far beyond its time and far ahead of its time.No graphics, no weepy love story, no crap about heroism of the two pilots, etc.Plain unvarnished, to the point, kick-in-butt film."
4,"A balanced view than ""Pearl Harbour."".","If you compare this film with the post 9/11 epic Pearl Harbour you will notice a striking difference. Tora Tora Tora! actually tries to make sense of the event and look at it from the Japanese point of view as well. How different to the post 9/11 ""Pearl Harbour"" where the Japanese are dehumanised and presented as heartless villains. It shows how far back into paranoia, zenophobia and flag - waving America slipped after 9/11. Throw the later version away and buy ""Tora Tora Tora!"" if you want a balanced treatment of the most successful surprise attack in military history."
3,Semi unusual problem,"Have a playback issue with this disk. The Japaneese dialogue is done in Japaneese with english sub titles. And subtitles are displayed underneath, not part of, the picture. I'm fine with all that. But in watching those scenes I could not get my player to show more than the first line of the subtitled dialogue thereby missing anything beyond that first line. Finally gave up because couldn't tell what was going on. Otherwise great looking disk."
5,Less Money At Amazon.UK,This isn't a review of the movie as that is 5 stars however Amazon.UK has the Blu-Ray version without the book for less money and it's 3 minutes more in length which tells me you are paying for the book so you might want to pick up the US version and the British version. I would also like to point out that the packaging is not the best for the DVD. It is enclosed in a paper slip at the back of the booklet and will scratch when pulled out over time. I don't know who the bright guy was who invented this but they could have redesigned the book so that the DVD would fit in a plastic case.
4,Great Movie on Pearl Harbor.,"This is a great depiction of what happened at Pearl Harbor. It even gives an inside look at Japanese intentions and war strategies. The battle scenes are true to life and are excellent considering when this movie was made in the late 70's. If you like war movies, this is a good one to own."
5,Classic Depiction of Attack on Pearl Harbor,"I saw this movie years ago, and recently received it via Netflix. It is still a classic WWII movie that depicts the suprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie traces the tale of Dec 7, 1941 from both the American and Japanese perspective, which makes it different than most war movies (except for The Longest Day). This approach adds a lot of detail, and the story becomes the main focus of the film, not the actors.Although the movie is a little long, the last 30 minutes of battle scenes makes up for the slow build up. Also, the movie does an excellent job showing how this tragedy unfolded, and all the mistakes made along the way.If you like WWII films, or want to learn about the attack on Pearl Harbor then I recommend this movie. It is much, much better than the more recent version."
5,A true story-telling movie,"With a focus on the story instead of people, heros or whatever Perl Harbor the movie tried to do, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a much better source of information about the time before and just after the Japanese Attach on Perl Harbor.The DVD has a nice THX encoding, only with a few hickups. But in all, the digitation of the movie and sound makes the movie look almost new, even though it has 30+ years behind it - this was made when M.A.S.H. the movie was being filed. The 30 minutes documentary is impressive too - allthough not much new stuff is rewielded.If I miss anything it's behind the scenes of the movie - but alas, I don't think movies about making movies were fashionable back then.For Movie and history ""buffs"" I would definately get this one."
5,Tora! Tora! Tora!,"This is the film that the Disney ""Pearl Harbor"" should have been. No state of the arts special effects can compare with historical facts, intensity, and spirit of this movie. ""Pearl Harbor"" is just a shadow of Tora! Tora! Tora!"
5,A history we repeat all too often.,Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it over and over again. An entertaining movie - great musical score but do not dismiss its lessons.
4,Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!,".....That was the signal to attack on Dec, 07. ..This is probably the BEST movie concerning this subject. Gripping & exciting all the way through. I much prefer finding out what the Japaneese are thinking and doing, in the days & weeks before this brillant sneak attack,.... than have a verry slow and corny love triangle provide the prologue for an exciting snapshot in history. If you haven't seen it by now, order now!! You won't be dissappointed!"
5,A War Film With Diversity,"Okay, so my wife doesn't like the movie because the scenes involving the Japanese are subtitled. To me, this is an absoluteplus. This motion picture highlights the Japanese planning andexecution of the most brilliant wartime raid ever made. It also shows an arrogant and somewhat disbelieving American view of theJapanese threat on the Hawaiian islands prior to our involvement in World War Two. It is one of the best war movies ever made.The DVD version is greatly superior as it offers a widescreenview (as presented in the theaters). Also, and as usual, the DVD version has an enhanced quality that is greatly improved over the VHS version. This movie is captivating. It grabs theattention, keeps the attention, and demands that it be reviewedagain and again. You will not be disappointed."
4,terry jarvis reviews tora tora tora,TORA TORA TORASUMMARYGREAT WW2 FILM SHOWS THE AMERICANS AS THEY ARE ALOAD OF UNORAGNIZED PLEBS
3,Tora! Tora! Tora!,"Great movie. Its a shame Hollywood feels the need to change history, which they do quite often, by making the statement by the Japanese Admiral Yamamoto about the time they were too bomb Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had nothing to do with the Geneva Convention during 1941, so to say they were to bomb at 0830 to abide by it was incorrect. It wasnt till 1942 that the Japanese Empire signed the accord. Shame on Hollywood trying to lighten what the Japanese did to our country."
2,TORA! TORA! TORA! is...,"BORING! BORING! BORING! And hopelessly jingoistic as well; you best bet might be to join in about two-thirds of the way through this mess! At least then you see carnage instead of tote boards; heroes instead of cowards, soilders instead of senators. A let-down that was hyped to rival PATTON."
1,Bora Bora Bora,"Just received this DVD and was very disappointed, after reading all the other customer reviews. The Wide Screen format was hard to watch, and not nearly wide enough, and the story was basically slow, boring, and basically no character development. I should have just rented it. Quite a disappointment."
3,Cosmo,"I think this game is fun at first, but gets extremly boring. There is no challange to the game. The worst part is, you can't save. People don't have the time or the patience to play forever in order to beat the game. The levels are all the same too. It also sucks that in order to kick, you have to press both buttons, and sometimes end up doing something you don't want to do. The kick is used a lot more then the punch adn jump. It should be a main button. Over all, it is an okay game. Not the best I ever played. Rampage 2 Universal tour is better."
3,Rampage world tour gameboy is not the best.,"This is not the best game ever. I will tell you the good and the bad about this game. The good: you have infinete lives. The bad: you can not save,bad graphics,and not fun. If I were you I would skip this game. If you have a N64 buy Rampage 2 universal tour.PS Rampage 2 needs a memory card. And also rampage 2 is super fun and great graphics.Thats all!"
1,I never even recieved the game,What a rip off i didnt even recieve the game i paid for to get for my brother for christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Rampage for GBC,"It's a fun gameWith lots off exitement but the levels are all the same and you can never save, but good for those who can sit down for an hour or two and play a game"
2,This game stinks,OK. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: This is cool because you can blow up a robot. You can pick up an item that will make you scream and blow up buildings.Cons: Just about everything else.-Mojo Dada
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased a set of these sheets for my in laws as a Christmas gift and also 2 sets for myself. They are junk! They should be classified as irregulars. On one set the edging is different widths, not a little different. It's off by 5 inches! A different set had 1 pillowcases stitches come out after washing and they shrunk a little bit but it was enough that my regular sized pillows don't fit in them anymore. My mother in law is not at all impressed with her set either.So save your money...don't buy these sheets"
5,Very Elegant,This sheet set looks very expensive and the count is high enough for a very comfortable sleep. Not too heavy. Beautiful print. Looks better than in the picture.
5,Great!,This vacuum picks up everything. The attachment for the stairs is wonderful. The only drawback is the cord is too short. I have to use an extension cord with it to vacuum.
3,On my nerves!!,"I really liked this vacuum at first. I have only used it three times, and now it makes me mad. Some dust flies out the side, and it doesn't pick up little things as good as my old one. It also seems to pick dirt up and then re-deposit it on the next run across. Frustrating!!!!"
4,Well worth the $$$ but.....,"The suction/pick up power is very good. I absolutely LOVE the rewind cord feature. It is lighter than my old windtunnel, but the cord is shorter. I'm getting use to the shorter cord and the emptying feature is nice. I just wish you didn't have to periodically take out the filter and bang it to clean it out. Overall for the money, great suction, and rewindable cord you can't go wrong."
1,"Heavy, bulky, yet delicate.","I found the thing as heavy as any machine I've ever used, but was pleased, at first, with the pick up, and lack of having to deal with shopping for the appropriate bag replacements. On the third use, however, I ran over a computer cord and when I pulled it out, usually nothing major, the rolling brush stopped rolling, and the sucking action was reduced to almost nothing. This thing is much too heavy and bulky to be so darn delicate. I am currently waiting for a replacement, and will live with my mistake, but certainly wouldn't recommend it, especially for a woman."
1,Do not buy,Should give 0 stars or even negative. Doesn't clean well at all. Didn't pick up even half the dirt that my old vaccum (which was also Hoover) used to pick. Had to return it.
2,Hoover 5507-900 Elite Rewind Upright,This vacuum could be a nice product. I will never know because the BELT buned out the first day.
5,Bagless under $100,"My wife and I bought this just before our wedding as we needed a vacuum. We currently live in an older house that had that ""older house"" smell...musty, dank...this vacuum removed that smell...and lots of ground in filth that was in the carpet. The carpets not only smell better but I can actually see that they are cleaner. Cleanup is a breeze - press a button, detach the canister, hold over your trash can, and depress the lever. The placement of the on/off switch and rewind aren't the greatest but very minor in comparison to the cleaning this thing does."
2,You get what you pay for,"Be careful if you purchase this product. The price is decent, but you have to keep it moving or it could cause damage to flooring. I luckily read about this issue from a reviewer who damaged the floor when letting the vacuum sit on unprotecting flooring while using the accessories. I vacuumed new but inexpensive carpeting with it and the amount of carpet fibers in the container blew my mind. Even at the highest setting. It is pretty heavy, and if you leave it sit for more than 10-15 seconds on a single spot it could cause damage. Use the highest setting on carpeting and keep it moving."
2,"Wanted to like it, but...","I wanted to like this vacuum because it has all the basics right. It has the attachments you would expect, including a pet hair vacuum for the extension. It's bagless and the canister is easy to empty and clean. The filters are also easy to remove and clean. It was cheap. It has good sucking power... at least at first.No matter how much I cleaned the filters, this vacuum would not suck anymore. It only lasted about a year. I took apart the filters and made sure they were spotless. I didn't see any other blockages or stuck parts. It just lost all its power! I even took it in for repair, and they said it was worthy of the dumpster.If you have a lot of pet hair, don't get this vacuum. I'd only recommend it if you want something cheap and you don't vacuum that often. Otherwise, get a nice, heavy-duty vacuum from someone like Riccar."
3,Good when it works.,"I like this vacuum. It has good suction and the hand tools work great for getting pet hair off the couch. The only problem was that the belt broke only after a couple of uses. I bought a new belt cheap on amazon and the vacuum is working well again. We'll see how long it lasts.I also like where the power button is located, so you just have to tap it with your foot. Overall it is a pretty good vacuum for the price."
5,Best Vacuum cleaner used so far,"I purchased it from Amazon in Aug 2007 and have been using it twice a month. It's by far the best vacuum I've used so far.The cleaning ability is very good and is reasonably quite.The replacement belts are also cheap.Update: 07 Jan 2012The product is still going strong. The only thing I had to replace was the belt for the brush. I use the product regularly that is -- vacuum $1500 sq. ft. house every week- clean vacuum cleaner filter every 2 months- clean vacuum cleaner brush every month- wait 10 minutes after every room, for the machine to cool downEven after so many years, I have not noticed any drop in its suction or power."
1,not worth it,"Bought this in December 08, we use it like anyone would, cleaning 1-2 times per week. the unit started making noise, then smelled, I pulled the bottom cover off and discovered the that the bearings that support the beater bar are made of felt, and had self destructed. I know $ 89 is cheap for a vacuum, i guess you get what you pay for."
4,priced right,"The power windup cord took some getting used to. It's on the floor on this model. It took 2 or 3 uses to adjust to this feature. The rewind cord feature, and position of this feature are just fine now. Ease of emptying the cup is great. The power brush attachment is great for tight spaces. Good suction on this product. Great price. Change is good!"
4,This vacuum meets my needs,"I needed a new upright vacuum, but didn't want to spend a fortune for one of those pricey, fancy-schmancy jobs. I looked at several reviews of this one, and after much thought ordered it. The arrival time didn't take long, and I had it put together in no time (I'm female, and somewhathandicapped too). It's much lighter (18 lbs.) than my Eureka The Boss 4-D upright vacuum (26 or 28 lbs.), has good suction, but doesn't groom the carpet quite as much as the Eureka does. The Hoover also has a pet hair brush that works great, has a washable filter, doesn't require bags, the dirt empties from the bottom of the container, and I loooove the retractable cord! All in all, for the price, it does a good job and doesn't break your back & shoulder when using it."
1,Horrible vacuum. Do not buy.,"We bought our first Hoover and are so disappointed with the product. It worked twice. The first time it was absolutely incredible. A little loud, but I can deal with the noise. It picked everything up great. A week later, I vacuumed the house again. Granted there is nothing special with our carpet. Just a plain carpet, I turned it on, began vacuming. After about 5 minutes I began to smell burning. It was coming from the vacuum. We contacted Amazon , who are absolutely wonderful with their return policy, and acquired another one since everyone gave it amazing reviews. Again, the first time, it was amazing. The second time I used it, the turning carpet brush part underneath the vacuum just stopped turning and it no longer sunctioned. Do not buy!!! I will never buy anything from Hoover again. Two vacuums in a row broke? No good."
3,Brush roller starts grinding against unit,"Pros:-sucks in a good way-dumping dirt is easy with canister-auto retract cordCon:I've had 2 of these. Eventually both of them died the same death. The brush roller would start grinding against the housing. So it will be very loud, vibrating and pieces of the roller comes off from the grinding. I tried changing the roller band but that didn't fix it."
2,not great at all,"at first i was happy with it but after a month of using it on normal conditions it just didnt pick up much and made a loud noise. took it to a service company and they wernt able to get rid of the loud noise. the connecting part for the canister broke so it has to be ducted taped and have to take it apart to clean it out. the only great thing about it, is the rewind cord. obviously im on amazon to look for a better vacuum. i bought hoover for the quality but its just not in this machine."
3,Don't order from Allergy Be Gone company!!!,"We purchased this vacuum cleaner and it came broken. It say's not to contact them but Hoover to see if it could be fixed through them first. They couldn't fix it as the parts came broken. I have tried over three hours on hold to get through to this company and they have NEVER ONCE answered the phone. I would NEVER EVER buy from the company and am now skeptical of purchasing from Amazon, which I have used many times in the past. What a horrible vendor. Allergy Be Gone must be a scam company selling broken/returned products and that is how they got the price."
4,Very powerful,"We have had this vacuum for about 2 years and it is very powerful. It's also easy to clean with no bags, I just throw the dust out and wash it out. It is a bit heavy and some of the attachments are constantly falling off. But on the flip side the attachments are very powerful as well and suck everything up quickly. I use it on my hardwood floors too."
2,One Big Drawback,"Not a bad vacuum for the money (decent suction power) and the cannister is easy to empty because it's a bottom drop style; however, putting the cap back on top of the filter cannister is a royal pain in the backside. It's secured by a twist-lock style, but I spend more time trying to lock it back in place than I do vacuuming, and that's no exaggeration. Furthermore, my attempts to replace the top (which should be quite easy) cause my hands to be covered in vacuum dust. It's a source of frustration that prolongs the chore of vacuuming. For this reason alone, I would not buy this vacuum cleaner a second time. The other problem I have with this product is that the attachments, when not in use, fall of the body of the vacuum. They're simply not well-secured in place, and I'm constantly having to bend over and pick them up. Grrr."
4,great value,"We purchased two of these vacuums - one for our daughter and one for ourselves. This vacuum is a great buy. It does a wonderful job on pet hair and day to day dirt. I was very surprised at how many times I had to empty it since our older vacuum, a hoover wind tunnel, seemed to be doing a good job. My only complain after a few weeks of use would be a wish for a longer cord. I really like the auto-rewind feature and the ese of emptying the cannister. Would definitely recommend."
1,Mine did not last even one year,"I liked the vacuum at first, easy to empty and use. I only have a rugs on my hard floor in the bedrooms and the living room, so it did not get used like someone who had carpets throughout the house. It began to overheat and would shut off. I have only had it about 6 months. Not worth the $$ I paid.Unhappy in Texas"
3,Excellent suction but it eats itself,"The vacuum is very powerful so much that it gnawed its own power cord. I had to re-tape the power cord so that I escaped from an electric shock.One has to extremely careful while using this equipment. It cleans up the carpet/floor very well. I liked few things about this m/c.- Multiple adjustments from bare floors to extra thick carpets- Excellent suction and easy removal of dust.- Attachments are very useful to clean sofa.- Retractable cord- Very cheapWhat I did not like- Rubber belt which easily heats up when you pick up pieces of big paper/cloth. The stink is so nastly when the belt gets heated up.- Suction is powerful, so much it is unforgiving when you vacuum accidentally on its power cord.Otherwise, it is an excellent vacuum cleaner. I would have rated easily 5 except for the above serious caveats."
2,CAREFUL this vac will damage your rugs !!! !!! PLEASE READ,"hi. prettty good vac for the money, but the beater bar does not turn off when you are using the tools, if you leave it in one spot for too long, it will damage your rug(s). So move it to hardwood floors or lay it down. I called Hoover to inquire why they would make such a huge blunder when designing this product, and the customer service rep told me that the higher priced hoover models have this feature, and that I get what i paid for. Very very rude ! I have a Dyson also, which was way way WAY overpriced, broken, and does not have a height adjustment, which will damage antique oriental rugs."
4,Does what it says on the tin,This was an inexpensive vacuum cleaner and it is a bit more plastic and cheaper looking than more expensive models but it does the job. It has good suction and took more dust out of the carpet than my last cleaner did (which was a more expensive one). I like the retracting cord and the cable length hasn't been an issue at all even for my large rooms. Great for the money.
4,great product,"I have been looking for a light but powerful vacuum cleaner for quite a long time. At one point I even purchased Dyson, but after trying it on our area rug and carpet, I realized that it was not worth $300. Very positive reviews about Noover U5507 - 900 prompted me to buy one through Amazon.com. First of all, I received the item on the 5th day after ordering it. I love it! It's light, it's powerful, the suction is great. It's easy to operate. I'm very happy with the auto-rewinding feature. I'm going to buy the second Hoover for the upper floor of the house.Thank you all who took time to write a review. It helped a lot."
3,just ordinar,"It`s just like any other vaccum, no big difference from the one that I have before, regular one."
1,Beaware of the positive reviews,"When I got the vacuum I was really pleased with the purchase. It had powerful suction, and very convenient retractable wire. Trouble is it doesn't last. Maybe two months after buying it is stopped sucking in the dirt. Maybe all those positive reviews were left in the first few weeks after purchase. The one year warranty is worthless to me. I'm not going to drag down to some service center, who knows where to have it repaired."
1,Worst Vacuum I have ever owned,"This is the worst, worst vacuum I have ever owned. Worst $70 I ever spent. It honestly makes my floors look worse. It really does. It just blows the dirt out the back end. Do not waste your money on this vacuum. Please believe me. I never write reviews but I felt compelled to do this time. It picks up nothing. Going to buy my Dyson now."
2,I sent it back,"It is not fair for me to slam this vacuum, since I did not keep it for more than one day. There were several things I didn't like. The roller does not stop moving even when you are using the hose. I did not find it ""pulling me around my house"" like some people wrote in their reviews. I vacuumed an entire floor of my house and only a handful of dirt was sucked up. Either I got a lemon or it was crummy, so I sent it back."
1,A Red Lemon -- Where's the Suctions?,"I was very disappointed in this Hoover. My last vaccum was a hoover and I loved it because it was more powerful than this and lasted seven years.The suction is very light and I have to go over the entire room over and over to pick up light dust. After empting the vaccum, the suction became worse. I became so discussed that I just bought another vaccum with more power and now I am happy, however, I paid more -- so I guess you pay for what you get.I would not recommend this vaccum to anyone."
2,quiet but not efficient,"We were trying to replace our old bagged hoover with this bagless model. The model looks cool, easy to assemble, and quiet. We were using it on the carpet and the results were far from satisfactory. Big dirt is picked up, but small dirt requires several runs on the same spot. A low-height setting will pull the carpet and make it difficult to move the vacuum cleaner. The old one which we wanted to throw away was doing a better job than this new one in swallowing small dirt particles, so we ended up returning this to the store. I am not sure if the model has less vacuum power or limited to just the piece I got."
1,Worthless warranty -,"I bought this vacuum 4 months ago and it was used once a week. After 4 months the motor made a horrifying noise. I checked to make sure the belt was not broken and examined the vacuum for blockages. Everything looked shipshape. I contacted Hoover for service and even though I live in a major metropolitan area, the closest ""authorized hoover repair"" is an hour drive round trip. This was after contacting 2 other ""authorized repair services who were no longer accepting residential repairs. I was also told I could ship it for repair but they would only pay one way for shipping. I am writing this review to spare potential purchasers the hard lesson that I learned. Moral of the story: Make sure you buy a vacuum where the warranty allows you to service the vacuum locally."
1,Was great until it broke!,"This was a great vacuum for the price, but all-of-a-sudden it stopped working :(I'm very disappointed considering it's only a year old!! Also, we don't vacuum up anything weird, so there's really no excuse for this.I would recommend buying something different."
5,Great Vacuum,"This vacuum was promptly delivered, easily assembled and works as advertised. What more can you ask for?"
2,Very dissatisfied!!!!,This vacuum has a very short hose and you cannot use it to clean anything other than floors. The attachments would work fine if the hose was long enough so that the vacuum didn't have to be within two (2) feet of where you are trying to clean; the vacuum then falls over when you try to pull it close enough to do a good job of removing dust from walls or furniture. I would not purchase this vacuum again!
4,Hoover Elite Vacuum,"This vacuum is good. I like the floor/carpet option dial for cleaning because it lowers the vacuum head so that if you want to vacuum the bare floor it will pick up all the dirt. The on/off switch, lower the vacuum switch and the cord rewind switch are all accessible by foot, which is very nice. The only issue I do have with this vacuum is where the plug is located. I love the concept of having an automatic plug rewind; however, it is located towards the bottom of the vacuum that you have to make sure that you hold the cord up nhigh enough. If not, you will then constantly be vacuuming over it."
3,overall good vacuum,"Now used it for 3-4 months. Overall good vacuum.Great suction power.Retractable cable worked fine.Light weight and no bags feature worked best.Looks like it sucks some fibres from the carpet, but I guess it is true with all the vacuums.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is if you leave it turned ON for couple of seconds on a tile floor, it will it leave hair and dust particles behind."
1,Worse vacuum,I would give this vacuum zero stars if I could. I just spent 30 minutes to get the 5 screws out to change the belt that broke after only 2weeks of use. I'm frustrated with grease all over my hands from changing the belt.I returned my first one because the belt broke several times in a short period of time. I stupidly brought a second (thought the first was a lemon); I will be returning this one as well.
3,"Part good, part bad",Very good suction. Very poor design to have the floor brushes rotating while the tools are being used - will wear a hole in the carpet!
5,"Good deal, good vacuum, I like it","This machine really sucks up the dust well. I love being able to take it apart and clean up the two filters. One of which is the lifetime HEPA filter that is going to save me money. A previous reviewer said that dirt falls out of the hose when you switch to the accessories -- that was not my experience at all.It is really neat watching the big ball of lint form as you vacuum carpet. And the little accessory with its own power brush is super for stairways. As for drawbacks, I would agree that it would be nice to have an extension wand. And on another point, be cautious when rewinding the power cord, I got whacked on my ankle because I did not hold onto the plug like the instructions advise."
2,I wouldn't buy this vacuum.,"I bought this vacuum a month ago and returned it today. At first I liked it for many of the reasons listed here, cord rewind, filter, good suction. But the reality is it spews dirt all over your house when you use the hose feature. I read the manual to ensure I was using the feature correctly, and still, spewing. Also, the hose is short which means you don't have a lot of range from the unit and you end up bending over most of the time. The vacuum does not work on hard floors as it just ""pushes"" the dirt. The profile of the vacuum makes it hard to get under furniture. And, it's not self propelled so one really has to push. I found using this vacuum a tug-o-war and a work out, and not in a good way. I have no problem exerting myself but this vacuum would have been a problem for my mother with a bad back. I'd rather get my workouts at the beach!"
3,Hoover Elite Vacuum,"Great Price, very powerful vacuum. The biggest fault is the brushes don't stop rotating when cleaner is in upright position to use hand tools. This can lead to carpet ""burn"" must leave vacuum standing on non carpet or a smell from brushes rotating in one place on your carpet. Why Hoover allowed this flaw is unbelieveable!!!! It is a quick fix to stop brush rotation. I have never seen this happen before on any vacuums, especially cheaper brands. Hoover needs to fix this, it had potential to damage carpet or even cause a fire. Other than this major problem, it would be a great vacuum at a great price. I gave it only 3 stars due to the brush problem."
4,A fantastic vacuum for the price!,I bought this vacuum four months ago and it works great! Easy to use and really seems very powerful. Picks up things from your carpet that you didn't even see. The push-button release for the dirt container makes it very simple to empty. This is an excellent vacuum for the price. I use about a mid-range height setting for my carpets and it works great.
2,You get what you pay for.,The belts break easily. Also after a while the thing just stopped working. I opened it up but couldn't figure out what the problem was.
1,Stopped working - DON'T BUY!!!,"I loved this vacuum for the first couple of months. The suction was incredible & the automatic cord rewind was great. That all changed after a couple of months when it wouldn't pick up anything. I wasted hours trying to get the thing to work again & finally just threw it in the garbage. It happened suddenly w/o warning. Now I'm looking for a new vacuum, but it seems like every other vacuum on Amazon has a lot of bad reviews too with people claiming their new vacuums died on them also. I don't know if I should go for the ridiculously priced Dyson or another lower priced upright, comparable to the one I'm writing this review about. I guess they really don't make things the way they used to..."
1,Not a good Design,Mine is still working but every once ina while ... i have to remove the two screws at the back of the vaccum where the hand held fits in and then clean the path at the bottom of the vaccum. What ever it sucks gets collected there little by little since it has to go a long way to reach the container(around the hand held chord). Further when u use it for suction like the spacer bags...forget it... it has no sucktion when u use the hand held.
1,Do not spend your money on this vacuum,"This is the first time i've had a Hoover that did not last more than 10 years at least. I use the vacuum twice a month on two area rugs, and that has been probable why they always lasted so long. When i received this vacuum the first time around had to return it because it did not work. This should've been enough warning not to get the same item again, but i was sold on the vacuum being bagless, the power, the retractable cord etc.,etc,etc.Well, one year and two days after the warranty expired it died, so it figures i used it about 24 times. I went online and followed all cleaning instructions, checking for any obstructions and still will not work. Tried to contact a Hoover service center, and was told that i had to bring the unit to their place and pay for any repairs (something between $25-$100)!!!!Bottom line, i threw it in the garbage and went back to the bagged machines again."
1,Stopped Working,"I wonder if the same people who gave this vacumn high ratings would give the same rating after six months. Mine worked well for about six months and stopped working this past weekend. I had it cleaned out thoroughly and replaced the belt, but the power would not come on. My first thought was that the built-in Thermal Protector shut it down because of overheating. It should then reset itself after 30 minutes. Well...it's been two days....I would think that you would want your vacumn works longer than six months. If so, please consider another product that is not made by Hoover. Good Luck if you decided to give this a try because of other reviews."
2,Updated Feedback,"I have updated my feedback for this product because the container cap fall off while I was removing the dust from the container. The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken (opened it only a few times). Although I was able to close the container now, I am afarid to open it the next time."
1,Do not buy!,"Purchased this a couple of months ago, first few times I used, the belt came off. Took bottom plate off and put belt back on. Used several more times, and each time the belt came off. Contacted customer service and they said this was a ""design flaw"" and the belt keeps slipping. Advised to turn the belt inside out and it should work better. They also were going to send me replacement belts, since the belt slipping off all the time was going to cause it to wear out faster. 2 months later and still don't have the replacement belts. Called customer service again and asked what the next option was, explained I wasn't happy with this and was tired of not being able to make it through one room without the belt coming off 3 times. Customer service not much help and didn't offer any solutions other than we'll try to send you another belt.I assumed being a Hoover that it would work well and have good customer service......don't bother. I am returning this tonight and buying a Eureka!"
1,Defective unit features,"After about 2-3 months, I had problems with the extension tube's rotating brush head. The brush stopped rotating, meaning that it now simply gets in the way of airflow. And the main body takes two or three passes to get some very easy, lightweight things up. I also agree: it's bad to leave the thing running in one spot because it will friction damage your carpet, which is a bad flaw. So when you use the (badly designed) extension tube, watch out. Another problem: if you run one side of the main floor unit under a narrow rim, i.e. a cabinet, the main vac belt tends to come off. This cleaner needed more testing and was marketed too quickly."
4,"So far, so good....","Vacuum seems to be working fine so far, only had it for a month... Only drawback seen as of yet is the power cord is a bit short - not a major problem, just used to a longer power cord, so now I have to stop and move cord to new outlet to finish. Otherwise, seems to be a good vacuum."
2,3 Fan Belts Later,Less than 30 days old .... 3 fan belts have broken on the vacuum! One wonders if it can go 30 days without a replacement part.
4,good product,"I like everything about the hoover u5507-900 except the short cord.The auto rewind is great, just need a little more cord in there."
1,Broke within 5 minutes of using it.,"Ok, I opened this vacuum up and assembled it with no problem. I started vacuuming and within 5 minutes the plastic main shaft snapped in two, the vacuum broke into two pieces and I couldn't even use the shut off to stop the motor. I had to yank the plug out of the wall socket to avoid sparking. What a POS! Maybe I got a defective unit but I will not reorder, refund please."
3,It looks like the product is not homogeneous,"The vacuum arrived reasonably quickly, well-packaged and in condition as described. The reason I put 3 stars is the following. I purchased this vacuum because my boyfriend has the same and I tried it many times, it worked great. However the one I got seems to be extra-powered. It ate my cell phone charger (a piece of cord was on the floor), and it completely destroyed it in a second. It also will eat your carpet if you don't stay alert while vacuuming. I don't know why the same model works so differently. Both vacuums were purchased through Amazon."
4,SURPRISE,I'VE NEVER HAD AN ALL PLASTIC VACUME AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAD HOOVERS. I'M STILL AFRAID IT WILL BREAK IT LOOKS SO FRAGILE. ASK ME AGAIN IN SIX MONTHS.
1,Garbage,"Here's a what I don't like about this vacuum:1) you can't turn off the rotating brush; that makes it impossible to use on hard floors, unless you wear ear plugs; if you set the brush for high carpet, the noise will drop but you won't clean anything either. Also it has a tendency to grab cables which happen to be nearby.2) it's insanely noisy. If you live in a condo, all your neighbors will enjoy the sound.3) it's suction power is fairly weak4) if you need to reach high above cabinets and fridge to vacuum the dust, this vacuum cleaner is not the tool5) the power cord constantly gets under the vacuum brush; you have to hold it in your hand to avoid this. Or you can try vacuuming without a back and forth motion of the vacuum.So save your money and buy something else. This is a waste. It's a low end useless tool."
2,Not satisfied with this vacuum,It blows things out after it sucks them in. The hose is too short and the cord rewind got broken at the third time I use it. The plastic looks cheap too.
4,Concious design,"I got this one from Amazon. Two things I would like to highlight about this vacuume. The power cord rewinding is excellent feature. Just press button and rewinds smothly dissapears in the enclosed case.Second one is the emtying the trash. I love the way the designed the contained. Just press the button and remove the trash can. It is very easy and intutive.It canbe still improved on the following: Length of the power cord, design of vacume pipe attachment (sometimes it comes out easily), It took a while to find out how to attach the hose to vacume."
5,Value for the money,"I bought this vaccumcleaner which really is good, and value for money. It cleans the carpet very good. And also good on tough floors too."
4,As a gift,"I bought this for my Mom as an early Christmas gift and she says it works great. The only bad thing is with the automatic cord winder, you will get hurt if you do not pay attention to it."
5,Hoover Elite Bagless Upright Vacuum,This is a fantastic product. When I vacuum it's almost like steam cleaning. And no more bags. It's great!
2,"Great at first,then disappointing","We bought this vacuum 13 months ago. It worked pretty well until about two months ago and then we noticed it wasn't picking up well. Now, 2 weeks out of warranty, it doesn't pick up anything unless you are using the attachments. We've cleaned it out so there are no blockages. I really think a vacuum should last more than 1 year. Maybe we just got the lemon.."
2,Hose keeps falling off,This vacuum picks up ok but my problem is when I use the hose it does not stay attatched to the vacuum cleaner. It falls off very easily every time I move it around. I cannot find any way to keep the cord attatched and it is very annoying.
1,Absolute Junk,"This vacuum is compete junk. After owning it less than it for a month my wife and I had it into the Hoover service center 4 times. The store technician said, in not so many words, that it was complete junk and they have nothing but problems with them. So when I asked about the warranty that I had officially registered through their website, the manager told me that the company had been restructured and that I should just purchase a better model. So when I ask to return the deffective product and get credit towards a better model, he informed me that the only credit would go towards the standard retail price and since they were already having a holiday sale, the credit he could giive me would not benefit me at all. I would recommend avoiding this model and Hoover's all togethr if possible. Their warranty is worthless and their service centers basically told us that since the product was junk to begin with, there isn't much that they could do for us."
4,Clunky but strong,"The only complaints: this is SO heavy and awkward. They made it sound like 23 pounds is lightweight, but it is a real hassle to get up and down stairs, even with the handle. And the other thing, the hose is way too stiff and thick, so you feel like you have to argue with it to use the attachments. The little spinning brush did a fabulous job on furniture, but you have to get used to that dang, inflexible, too-industrial hose. Other than that, this is the best vac I have ever had (and it is my 8th in my 55 years). The cord rewind is awesome - way quick so you have no excuse to skip vacuuming. The motor is very powerful thus the vac is extreeemely efficient. Just think twice about the weight and the clunkiness of the hose. Those two factors made it a 4, otherwise it is a 5. Good price on Amazon."
1,Not very good,"The vacuum worked for one week, after that it made a horrible noise. The Auto-Rewind feature is great, but that is about the only good thing about this product. The vacuum was returned to Amazon."
5,great suction,"This is the first vacuum I've bought and I must say I am impressed. The suction is very nice and after I'm done vacuuming the carpet looks good and feels clean. It also works great on hard floors, I doesn't kick around dirt like other vacuums I've used. The filters work good on it because there's no dusty smell after you turn it on.I thought I wouldn't care about the retractable cord but it has become a feature I really like about this vacuum.This is a great vaccum especially for the price!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased this vacuum because...hello...it is a Hoover and I have had a fantastic Hoover for many years that just cut out on me. The problem is that this vacuum does not work well at all. I purchased it last year and intially it seemed to pick up some of the apparent and apporpriate sized litter on the floor, however, I watched as over time my carpet became more, and more bogged down and soiled looking. Now a year after purchase, it will not pick up anything. It never had enough suction to be very efficient. I am very disappoited and do not reccomend that anyone purchase this product."
1,Waste of Money,"While this vacuum may do the job, it is something I regret purchasing.I bought it as Costco and I did not research the product or any others before purchasing it, I bought it from a friend's recommendation. It is VERY difficult to take apart and put back together. When I clean it I get dirt all over myself (I don't understand this bag less vacuum craze, while it is environmentally friendly, it is in no way convenient or pleasant) To top it off, the burning smell that others have reported is something I have experienced as well. I would not waste the money, it is a very cheap quality vacuum and has a short life.If I had another suggestion I would gladly give it. I do not have a lot of experience purchasing a vacuum, I can only assume it is worth doing a little research and investing more money."
2,Liked it but did NOT Last,"I got this vacuum about 9 months ago. I loved it. It's the best vacuum I have ever had. The wind up cord is fabulous. It had a lot power. The emptying process was convenient as were the accessories. Everything was great, but one day it just quit sucking up and started spitting everything out. There is a thin layer of white fuzz on the front of the vacuum after I use it. The debris just gets spit around to new places, not sucked inside the vacuum. I am disappointed it did not last longer."
5,I love this vacuum cleaner!,"I am thrilled with the Hoover 900 Elite Bagless Vacuum! It's actually fun to clean when I can see the amount of debris I'm picking up with this vacuum! The deep cleaning action is so strong that the container fills quickly making me realize how much my old vacuum missed. With two dogs I'm always cleaning up dog hair, and now I don't have to worry about letting my grandbaby crawl on the rug because I know it's deep-down clean after using my new Hoover. I highly recommend this great vacuum; it has surpassed my expectations."
1,Worst purchase ever!,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. I had read great reviews before buying this vacuum cleaner and when I brought it home I initially loved it. However, it has been 8 months now and it is broken. The suction is hit and miss. Most of the time, the vacuum shoots out dust and pet hair instead of sucking it up. I have already replaced the belt once and taken it apart multiple times to fix the suction to no avail. I would never recommend this vacuum to anyone."
2,Rewind only good quality,"I'm actually glad to see that this vacuum is unavailable--they should stop selling it. The only good feature is the automatic rewinding cord, which works flawlessly. Otherwise it's clunky to use, difficult to replace the cannister and hard to find the button to turn it on when you are standing over it. Ours finally died today after two years and I'm thrilled to be able to replace it with something more functional. I've truly hated this vacuum."
4,Best in the market,"I bought it six months back and its still works good, the wire rewind comes in handy. Its worth buying this product."
4,Gift for my parents,This vacuum works really well. My parent's have a cat and my mom vacuums everyday without an issue. Picks up hair her old vacuum missed. The upholstery attachment doesn't work that well.
3,What's up with the broken belts?!?,"Got this vacuum in June 2009. Also ordered a replacement belt package (2 belts) at the same time. The vacuum has worked pretty well for us but we have been having nothing but problems with the belts.By September the original belt and the 2 replacement belts had broken and I had to order another package of 2 belts at that time. Since then 1 more belt has broken.Don't know if it is the vacuum design or just cheap belts. Of the 4 belts that have broken (so far!), 1 was the wife's fault. She ran over a scarf which got caught up in the rotating brush until it just stretched the belt out too much that it broke. I have absolutely no idea why the other 3 belts broke."
5,Best Vacuum ever owned,"I searched well before I bought a vacuum cleaner, being as though I have had bad experiences in the past. Even after spending money on a reputable brand, I was disappointed with my Sears Kenmore vacuum. However, this Hoover is by far the best vacuum cleaner I have ever owned. It is picking up dirt and dust in my carpet that I am sure has been there for quite some time. My Kenmore was sure missing a lot of dirt! This vacuum is easy to use, easy to clean, and works amazingly well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
4,Vacuum sucks - but that's good,"This vacuum does what you want a vacuum to do - suck up dirt. Forget the frills, this vacuum has stong suction for getting dirt out of the carpet, plain and simple. Hose attachments are easy to use, since the hose is built in, not a separate item, but the hose is short and so springy that the vacuum tips over if you try to reach very far.It's easy to empty the dirt canister and it uses a permanent filter (other bagless vacs need pricey replacement filters). But be aware, cleaning the filter is a messy job involving a lot (because it holds so much dust) of whacking on a hard surface. I do it on the basement floor and then use a dust pan to sweep up the pile. I think it would be worse trying to do it directly into a trash can.The cord rewind is convenient too, but not the reason to buy."
2,Not worth,"I am a person who trust the user reviews and blindly buy the product if it has good reviews. But that turned wrong on this product. I wonder how people gave 5 star rating for this product. It doesn't solve the purpose at all. The motor is so weak. You can hear its struggle as you move it. And obviously the suction force is very feeble. The only pros is the auto-rewind feature, which is really good. I had an Eureka prior to this, which was very powerful with self-propulsion, and a knob to switch between hose and floor. It is better to have both separate so the suction power would be great. It wasn't expensive either, I don't remember the price but it was almost close to this hoover's price. I wish I bought the Eureka again. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,So far so good,This product was purchased as a gift for my son. He has only used it several times but has said it does an excellent job picking up dog hair. He is also thrilled that he hasn't had to replace a bag.
2,Cheaply made,"It vacuumed well enough, but the cord retractor kept jamming and had to be taken apart. The little rotating brush attachment is activated only by suction and quickly gets fouled with hair. You can easily spend a half hour picking stuff out of it. We ended up returning it."
2,GREAT...at first.,"I bought this vacuum at a local Costco after reading the reviews online. It was great--for a week until the belt broke after a dodgy incident with a throw rug that I'd rather not go into. I returned it and got another one and this one did an amazing job--for one and half months. Almost two months later the suction is poor, it spits back out dirt, and generally seems malevolent. We have two cats, one dog, one toddler, and one pregnant wife in this house and quite frankly I need more peace of mind in my household products."
1,You have to dust afterwards!,"I hate this vacuum...let me take a minute to vent. Because the extension hose is how the dirt gets into the canister when vacuuming, as soon as you take the extension hose out, dust flies everywhere. The vacuum itself is constantly covered in dust. And, the brush doesn't stop spinning when you're using the hose, so wherever the vacuum is sitting while you are using the hose is getting beat up by the constant spinning. It actually ripped through the upholstry of a chair when I had to prop the vacuum up to reach to the top of my drapes with the hose. Which leads me to the short hose. You can't reach anywhere high.I really do hate this vacuum. It is by far the worst performing vacuum I have ever had. It's full of commonsense problems! Come on Hoover, you can do better.I think I spend more time cleaning up after this vacuum than I actually do vacuuming."
1,Don't buy this!,"This is by far the worst vaccuum I've ever owned! It picks up no dirt -- just pushes it around. If you have a dog, don't even consider this vaccuum. It takes me about eight sweeps over the same section just to pick up all of the dirt. Instead of three minutes to clean a small room, it takes nearly 20. Two months after I bought this vacuum, the belt broke. Four months later, the vaccuum completely died. Not worth the money."
3,Hoover Vacuum,Best vacuum for the price. Best Buy!You won't be disappointed with this Hoover Vacuum.
4,Great Buy,I recently bought this vacuum cleaner and I'm pleasantly suprised. I had another Hoover Windtunnel model and loved it til I beat the life out of it. Very impressed with the suction power of this vacuum. I was truly amazed. I like the auto cord feature...just don't press it to0 fast or you'll be whacking the thing into your walls. Only negative is that the cord is shorter than my windtunnels cord. I was so used to the areas that I could reach from each plug. All and all it's a GREAT BUY for the money!
4,Great Vacuum - Great Deal!,"This is an excellent vacuum at a bargain price. It is shipped in one box, and is very easy to assemble. For me, that's saying something as I am not exactly what you might call ""handy"". It probably takes longer to remove it from the box than it does to put it together!The vacuum itself has automatic cord rewind, though I wish the cord were a little longer. It has great suction, and a very fast beater bar. Our carpets looked fantastic after the first use. The unit is bagless, with a lifetime HEPA filter that is very easy to remove and clean. The canister comes on and off easily for quick emptying.Highly recommended."
5,great machine,"I bought it because the reviews were excellent and the vacuum is truly amazing, it is very silent, cleans great and I love the retractable cable. The tool to clean the the pet hair is awesome, it really picks up all the hair from my catI am very happy with it and two of my frinds are buying it because they like they way it cleansAlso the color is beautiful!"
3,"good, not great","Read a lot of reviews and this one got the highest number of positive reviews. This review is written after one , initial use. It is very maneuverable, does a great job sucking up the dirt and is not overly noisy. However, it does not have a shutdown feature for if something big, like the carpet, gets sucked up. Therefore, we have ruined one throw rug- it ate it pretty thoroughly (granted, I had assigned the job to a teenager, but still...). I like the bagless feature and the hand power tool. Another disappointment was the length of the cord for the crevice tool- the reach is very limited- ceiling height, but you have to keep dragging the machine around with you as it has minimal stretch to it. It is also larger than I expected- so it takes up quite a bit of storage space. Overall it is good, but not great."
1,***READ THIS BEFORE BUYING***,This vacuum is the worst product I have ever seen. After only a week of use I started having problems with the power switch. Then another week it kept burning up belts. The brush cylinder finally worrelled out the plastic at one end and is shot. Three weeks it lasted. I will never by another Hoover vacuum.
1,Worst Vacuum Cleaner ever!,This is the worst product I have ever used. It doesn't pick up anything. The rewind cord is nice but it is the only thing about this vacuum cleaner that works.
1,Buyer beware,The only good feature of this item is the self reel cord. This product is one of if not the worst vacuum I've ever owned.
4,keep a screwdriver handy,"Only problem i have experienced in a year of use is just the cord automatic rewind. It will, from time to time, get stuck and not release nor except cord into the winder. simply removing the 5 screws and cover will fix the problem. it is easy to do and fix, and since i have only done it twice i would say that this isnt worth not getting the vacuum."
5,Excellent Vacuum!!!!,"This is the best vacuum I have ever used, and the price is great. I vacuum my carpet very often and the amount of dust that it still pulls out of the carpet is amazing. I like that you can see the dust in the clear container, it makes you feel like you have really thoroughly cleaned your carpets. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,HOOVER,"Have used the Hoover Elite Rewind 3 times and it works fine so far. Strong pickup and beats the rug well. What I particularly like is the weight which if I recall was 15.5 lbs. Much lighter than my last Bissell vacuum and that makes it much easier to clean the stairs. I have tried many other methods to clean the carpeted stairs including the extension beater which hooks onto your hose but lets face it, nothing can clean as well as the vacuum itself if you can get it to each step and this Hoover is light enough to do so. I also like the fact that you do not need to replace filters which can be costly as my last Bissell vacuum needed. The cord does properly rewind easily. So far so good.Update to review. Used the unit for 3 years without any problems. Cleans well. Now my son is using it in his home and it's still working well."
5,Very reliable vac,It's amazing what can be sucked up with this vac. We have a Shepherd/Hound and this Vac has no problems picking up dog hair off HW floors and rugs.
4,Great Vac for the Price,This is my first upright vacuum ever. Second time bag-less. This Hoover upright was a gift. I used one at a neighbors home & loved it. Then I got it for my birthday the next week! Heavier than I thought it would be - for a petite 100 pound female. (upper body strength will be required more often). Heavy means quality -- I hope. Assembly was super easy. Attachments are sufficient. Cord keeper is awesome. Sucking power is pretty good on my purple shag carpet. I am diggin it so far!
4,"So far, so good, but I have had vacuums that with use loose suction. Time will tell with this model.","So far, good suction. Broken belt the first 10 minutes, but probably faulty belt. The company sent me a replacement upon my phone call. Finding belts locally was difficult. I had to order some on line to keep on hand. I've had one hose plug-up from the great suction, but hose couldn't handle the deluge. It was easy, though, to unplug. Replacement of the belt was typically the same as all machines. I LOVE the way the bagless canister opens. My others were very messy. This one I just insert in garbage can and let her go. Virtually no raised dust from the dump. Overall, so far I'm pleased with the product. For how long, time will tell, as with all other's I've had in the past, all from various manufacturers."
4,Great vaccum at a great price,"This is my first bagless vacuum and I'm amazed at it's suction power not only for dust, hair and lint but it really lifts the nap of the rug making it look and feel like new. The cannister holds a lot and I can do the whole house twice before emptying it. It's easy to empty, relatively quiet and overall a great vacuum for the money. Best of all, the attachments from my old Hoover fit (really do need the soft brush). So why pay more when this vacuum can do it all. The only reason I withheld the fifth star is because the on/off button is not conveniently located and the machine must be completely upright to activate it with your foot."
4,It's a vacuum cleaner!,"Great vacuum cleaner for the price. No expensive filters to buy, along with the pain of changing the filters. It cleans the carpet and wood flooring without spending $400 for a different brand (e.g. Dyson)."
5,LOVE it!,"Wow, well first let me start by saying I was extremely satisfied with my ordering experience with Amazon. I ordered this on a Wednesday afternoon, for $79.00, and it arrived on Friday morning. I didn't even have to pay for shipping. It arrived in perfect condition.To the vacuum:Love it! I took it out of the box and didn't even need to read the instructions to put it together. It vacuums my carpet and linoleum floor very well, definitely up to my standards (and I'm a clean-freak). It's extremely easy to empty the container that holds the dirt, and it clicks back in as easily as it comes out. I like the appearance, that it doesn't look so bulky as some of the other models nowadays. It is also surprisingly quiet. When I went to use the upholstery cleaner, it sucked so hard I thought my couch would come apart. Well not seriously, but it has the strongest suction of any attatchment I've ever used.I love this vacuum and I highly recommend it!"
1,Wish I'd Read Reviews Before Buying,"Purchased this vacuum just after Christmas, wish I'd read the reviews first. I'm 64 so I've had quite a few vacuums and this is the least user friendly one I've ever owned. The only thing good about it is the retractable cord. It doesn't pick up dog hair very well and after emptying, it's a pain to get back together. I'm taking it back to Target."
5,REDy Steady Clean,"HEPA filter and auto chord rewind features are nice. Not too heavy, and wide clean paths ensure clean strokes. Bagless feature is a plus...so far so good."
4,An answer to a Golden Retriever Owner's prayers,"Hoover U5507-900 Elite Auto-Rewind Bagless Upright Vacuum CleanerI have given up my old reliable Hoover Wind Tunnel for this great model.With Golden Retrievers in my home, I have been going through vacuum bags like they were peanuts. This baby eliminated that problem as well as getting my carpets, floors, and furniture really clean and free of dog hair.I have a little trouble putting the top cover on the canister, but other than that, I feel I have found a treasure."
2,Worked OK for a few months,"This vacuum was good when I first bought it last August. I loved the auto-rewind feature, but the vacuum simply stopped working a few days ago. Now I have to figure out if it's worth fixing."
4,So far so Great!,"Especially, for the price this has been a great vacuum. I have only had it a couple months but I am shocked to see the amount it picks up. It makes me want to vacuum everyday. The auto rewind is great too. So far so great!"
4,hoover does it again,"The hoover U5507-900 is a darn good machine. It is easy to use and especially easy to empty. The only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars is because the power cor is about 4 feet to short. My previous Hoover had a cord long enough to reach in any direction I need without changing outlets. The new one comes up short in this respect. Otherwise for the money , it can't be beat. Why spend $ 400+ for the D model, when for under a hundred you can get the same benifits."
3,Belt Problems,It works well but we've had the carpet agitator belt break twice now and that turning out to be very annoying. This is in a period of 1 month over cleaning my room 4 times.
2,Good vac but..,"I liked the vacuum cleaner when it arrived. I loved the retracting cord and I wonder why everyone doesn't do it. It seems light weight and easy to use. I also like the way the cannister is designed.The belt that runs the floor brush broke 35 days into it. Now I can't return it to Amazon and Hoover doesn't cover the belt under warranty.I now tend to agree with the other reviews that say that it is poorly built and the customer service is poor as well.update: I bought a $5 belt and put it in and it seems to be working fine now. It makes more noise than when I bought it, but works. i give it a **** now."
1,Look else where for your vaccum,The unit works very well at begining. My wife ordered the second one based on the first one. So we have actually two of these Hoover Elite Rewind Bagless vaccums at our house(one for each floor). Both units broke belt once within 6 months of use. No biggie. I took out 5 screws at bottom of each unit and replace belt for each unit. Now one of unit develop the suction issue. It simply won't pick up any thing anymore. I finally realized after took it apart that there is a filter inside of canister that is completely clogged up. I don't think it is washable. I will need to replace the filter for each unit. Folks. You save money on bags but this one will get you on the filters (around $5 each) and probably last you 6 months of less. I have hardwood floors/tiles at my house. I have no pet but 3 kids. I suggest look else where for a good vaccum.
3,great suction......but......,"The suction on this vacuum is great, and I was so excited about the auto rewind feature on the power cord. But after a few winds, the cord winder gave out on me and its just become cumbersome. so if the auto rewind feature is a selling point for you, rethink that. However, if you want a pretty good suction for the money, its a keeper."
3,I guess its just OK,"I really dont know how long vacuum cleaners last. Is it common to expect that you need to buy a new vacuum every 2 or 3 years or should they last longer. This one lasted for 3 years. I hate to buy a dyson and spend hundreds of dollars only for it to end up with problems after a few years just like every single vacuum cleaner out there.This product is prone to over heating and after three years, after you use this more than 20 mins it will automatically shut off. The suction is not as powerful and I think I need to buy a new one. Will I buy this product again, Im not sure. Was I happy with it from the beginning, meh! Would I recommend it, im neutral. Suction power was good in the beginning but got worse and worse as time goes by, after a year and a half I wasnt happy with the suction anymore. I use it on hardwood floors and carpet. I cant imagine this being used for pet owners.Off to search for the next vacuum cleaner, any ideas?"
1,It is not really that good,"I purchased one of these vacuums based on reviews such as those here. However, this Hoover is the worst one I have ever owned, Yes, it is powerful, but it is also very heavy and hard to push around. The canister that replaces a bag often gets plugged at the top and must be cleaned manually. Because of the power, the roller brush is very hard to direct on carpeting and it will not clean against the nap of a rug. The hook that holds the cord off the floor is not strong enough so the cord is constantly falling under the unit, and the accessories regularly fall off the handle during vacuuming. And, when it is time to clean the paper filter inside the canister, the job is very messy. I had an Oreck before purchasing this unit and now miss it very much."
2,Not good with long-haired pets,"This vacuum has lost of great features, but I was disappointed to discover that it's not good for people with long-haired pets. My dog's hair clogs the hose and the canister and it's a pain to get out. Don't get this vacuum if you have a pet with long hair!"
5,best ever owned,for the price it's hands down the best vac I've ever owned. Have a shedding short hair dog and it sucks it all up like crazy. Still running great after over a year.Get one!
2,great....while it lasted.,"It had great suction for the first couple of months but then it started to gradually lose that strength - but we found nothing causing any blockage. The retractable cord is a pretty nifty feature but I sort of loss track of that when wrestling with the top handle that kept coming loose from the base- due to screw coming undone. It's rather bulky. We tried to find a replacement screw but were unsuccessful. Then it just up and stopped working in the middle of cleaning the other day. It wouldn't turn on. We've had it much less than a year. Complete bummer. I don't recommend.We give two stars for extra long hose, a good effort on suction(the noise makes you ""feel"" like you're driving a mustang when your suction is a pinto) and retractable cord nifty add-on thingie ---what can I say I like the sparklies ;)"
4,works will,"I like this vacuum. It works as well as Dyson or my mom's oreck.But it's a lot less expensive,"
2,Not worth the box it's shipped in for carpets,"This thing is completely useless on carpets. I barely got through half our living room rug before it became completely clogged and won't suck up a thing. Even worse, everything that I thought I had gotten just fell out when I turned it off. I took apart all the filters and cleaned out all the moving parts before realizing that the clog was in the hose. Now, every time I vacuum the carpet the same story! It's useless to me."
3,"works fine, but...","when I am vacuuming, if I hit the wall's base molding (white) with the front edge of the vac, it leaves a black mark on it. To work around that, I tapped up the front edge, but I think Hoover should use a different non-marking material for the front edge.Other than that, it really ""sucks"" and I love it!"
4,Fairly good introduction to SAP R/3,"This book is a good introduction for new SAP R/3 Users. It covers SAPGUI, Session Manager and the different menus. It does not go into details. It is a good starting point for new R/3 users."
5,"Strawberry Wobbler, anyone?","To all those Discworld fans out there, especially to the ones that love the witches, buy this book! If you've always wanted to serve Dwarf Bread to your guests (or beat them over the head with it) this is the book for you. I bought mine from the UK and the measurements are often in the metric system (I'm not sure about this one) but overall it's easy enough to understand.Some of the stories will have you rolling... Carrot and Oyster pie comes to mind, which Mrs. Ogg helpfully annotates: ""Carrots so's you can see in the dark and oysters so you have something to look at!""Pick this one up for page after page of fun. The more knowledge of the Discworld you have (and its cusine), the more you will laugh."
5,Great addition to the Disc World books!,"This is an enjoyable tongue-in-cheek ""serious"" cookbook written by Nanny Ogg who is one of Terry Pratchett's more notorious witches. She also gives valuable life wisdom for all you budding witches out there. For example; she addresses the etiquette when giving a dinner party of where to seat the man who makes a living putting weasels down his trousers at fairs (Give him a really soft cushion since he suffers for his Art.) as well as other must have advise for the happy homemaker. Some of the recipes are actually appealing and I will most definitely be trying them. I particularly like the looks of the recipe for Deep-Sea Blowfish. This cookbook is a nice little insert to the whole Disc World series."
4,Tasty Fun,"This book is a delight to read, much in the tone of the most humorous of Pratchett's books. (What else would you expect for a book allegedly written by Nanny Ogg?) While I would not necessarily recommend this book just for its recipes (and a few are there mainly for the humor), I did make the ""Genuine Howondaland Curry"" which turned out to be quite good. The book also includes some essays on Nanny Ogg's views on etiquette, inter-species relationships, and similar issues taken from the irreverent viewpoint of Lancre's most entertaining witch."
3,"Compliation of Nanny Ogg Clips, Suggested Use","If you have read all of Terry Pratchett's Disc World series, particularly those books that deal with Granny Weatherwax and her sometimes sidekick Nanny Ogg, you will not find anything new here. This is due to publishers coming up with new ways to market old material. This is not wrong if they would 'fess up when they do this. However, if you like Nanny Ogg, then you might enjoy this collection of her sayings and recipes which are very humorous.One suggested use for this book is to keep it in the kitchen next to the real cookbooks and the next time you have a guest bothering you while you are trying to cook you can pretend to be using this cookbook. Note down some arcane ingredient and then ask them to get it from the grocery store on the other side of town. By the time they have given up, you can have the real dinner ready."
4,About color within color,"You could see the world black and white with black and white people. But within both races there are so many different hues upon which people are judged again as well.Plum Bun, written during the Harlem Renaissance, is about this. It's the story of Angela and her sister Virginia, who is blacker than Angela. The story follows the life of Angela and who no one really knows she is black and how she doesn't act upon it. She tries to enter a white world, also by changing her name. It gives a good insight into the complexities of color, and therefor worth reading this novel by Mr. Fauset."
1,Microsoft is good! Exchange is good!,"If you want a Microsoft marketing glossy, why pay for it? All this book does is repeat ""Microsoft is good! Exchange is good!"" over and over again."
2,"If you know nothing about KM, this will teach you something","This is a very introductory book with too little detail illustrating various solutions. While the book does mention the Microsoft products that could be used and have been used (which are now out-of-date) for KM, it does not really promote them. The book does not say that Microsoft products are superior to non-Microsoft products, nor does it even mention any features that Microsoft products have that many competitors don't."
5,Another masterpiece by Meirelles,"As I said in my previous reviews, this album is not different. Meirelles chose again the best of the Brazilian folklore. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
5,Classis Post-Apoc!,This movie was made in the early 1970's and has a bit of a departure from its contemporaries in that the end comes from ecological disaster rather than nuclear war. Certainly not the ONLY film to treat the genre this way but one of the few.
2,Stand not worth the money,"This stand was easy to put together except for the wheel casings. The wheels also do not stand up to the weight of the hitachi 32"" television set that I bought to go along with it, the wheels are already bent."
5,Wondrous,"A page by page beauty. The prose glows and the wondrous thing about reading John O'Donohue is that he gives you the gift of being yourself. The words are keys, one after another, to such deep and warm places in the heart. A fine, fine book."
3,Warm and fuzzy feel good,"This book is like a fireside chat from a wise and compassionate friend.He gives advice on how to cope in this harsh modern world. Central to his ideas is nurture of the soul.I'm sure many people find this book a comfort. At times though, he gets vague when trying to be too poetic. I quote:""The imagination is the inspired and incautious priestess who, against the wishes of all systems and structures, insists on celebrating the liturgy of presence at the banished altars of absence."" Another quote: ""The huge longing of the human mind is to discover ever larger shelters of belonging."" He has many vague statements, which sound very pretty. However, it would be better if he had presented more practical advice."
2,Eternal Echoes,Eternal Echoes: Celtic Reflections was a dissapointment for me. It seemed very repetitive although it did make some good points.
2,vague and repititious,"I can't understand all the fuss about this book. It was vague, wordy, ambiguous, contradictory, and or no practical help.We are told to ""anchor our longings"" but never told how or what exactly he means by this. I can literaly open any page of this book and wonder what on earth he is talking about because he never gives examples or practical steps. Example: ""The visitor is one who belongs somewhere else, but is now here in the world of your belonging."" Read on in the paragraph and you get more of the same.I stayed with it to the end assuming that he would surely explain some fundamental truth that we can apply to our lives. He didn't."
5,All Time Favorite,"This is one of my favorite jazz albums. Dinah Washington's singing is so exuberant. The blues numbers--""Trouble in Mind"" and ""After You've Gone""--are phenomenal, but the standouts in my opinion are the extended jazz classics, especially ""Blue Skies"" and ""I'll Remember April."" The instrumentals go on and on, and while Dinah sticks close to the melody, she also somehow gives the impression of improvisation and play. Washington is a must-have artist, and this is a great album for getting acquainted with her."
3,"Dinah, You Almost Left Me Cold...","This is just OK...I would like to hear more Dinah and less distracting back up solos that are just so-so in their impact.I think that I would enjoy a different selection of songs, too. Overall, not a bad effort, but can't compete with later stuff."
2,Print is too small,"I have good eyesight, but the print in this book is far too small to be comfortably legible. I should've imagined this would be the case given the price. I plan to buy a different edition because I'd rather have a book I can comfortably read that costs more than a cheaper one I would never read."
5,Long Lasting,These batteries last forever in my Sony Voice Recorder!!!I havent used them for anything else.
2,Over priced,"I bought this for my grandson and was disappointed. The top runway kept coming apart from the truck and, in general, the item does not appear to be worth the money."
5,PORTER'S LYRICS SANG BY THE FIRST LADY OF SONG!,"Ella's superb interpretations of Porter's songs are truly something which no lover of popular music can resist; from ""Begin the Beguine"" to ""Love for Sale""(v.II) these songs are timelessly sophisticated and no one can sing them as beautifully as Ella! A must!"
5,Amazing Single!,"I was very impressed with this single, much more so than with Part 1. This single begins with the first two mixes of ""It's In Our Hands:"" the Soft Pink Truth Mix and Spike Stent's Arcade Mix. Both are very interesting mixes--the Soft Pink Truth Mix is beat-laden and dancey while the Arcade Mix seems much more experimental. However, the real gem of this single is So Broken (live on Jools Holland), a beautiful track of Bjork singing--accompanied by a spanish guitar. This single is limited to 5,000 copies and is accompanied with the amazing art of Gabriella Fridriksdottir and M/M."
4,book review,This is another classic for those who enjoy western adventures. L'Amore has a way of spinning a yarn that lets you be a part of the tale in your own mind.
4,Silver Canyon,"Book by Louis L'Amour, Great reading. I intend to read all of his books. One of my favorite authors. Read it."
4,Enjoyed,"Another one of Lois L'Amours work, truly enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy a westerns."
4,wonderful story,This is a great story about people under the stress of a failing economy and their wonderful solution. A wonderful and tearful experience.
2,I loved it!!! but the language is in japanese...,"The movie is superb! I loved it, but only drawback is that the voices are in japanese!!!!! I wanted to see the movie in english not in japanese with subtitles in english!!!"
5,An excellent reference source.,Excellent source of reference for the Win32 API and MFC and how to apply them in developing applications for Windows.
4,lots of good info,there is a lot of information in this book. just keep in mind that is is very very dry reading. will not teach you how to make shoes but teach you how to make better shoes.
3,The Art of Boot and shoemaking: A practical Handbook........,"Having gone through I have not been able to find or buy some of the materials mentioned in the book which I needed to complete a project. I am sorry I will not be able to give correct preview because I have not completed anything. I hope an update of new materials that are alternative to the old materials could be suggested so that one could then manage, but as a novice, you have no clue of what to do or whom to ask for advice. I am in limbo at the moment until I can figure out what I can or how I can complete this journey of mine."
1,Not What It Says,"I purchased this book after reading the one review--boy was that a mistake. This book is beyond useless if you want to make shoes or boots. 99% of this book is nothing but verbiage, and the few drawings in the book are of the most general kind. It would be much more accurate to say that this is more a book about the history of shoe and bootmaking rather than a hands on instructional. So, if you want to learn the history of shoemaking from one person's perspective, than this book is for you. But if you want any information at all about making shoes and even making a last, this book is a total waste."
3,Could be much better,"I'd give this workout 3 1/2 stars.I've been working out with kickboxing/boxing DVD's for many years, and consider myself an advanced fitness kickboxer. I usually have no problems following KB workouts---even the first time through--if the cuing is good.While I really like Kelly's personality (in this and other workouts), and like the choreography in this workout and the fact that her modifier doesn't dumb things down, I find her cuing (or lack of) very annoying.She uses the cue ""punch"" for both ""any type of punch"" (jab, cross, hook or upper cut) as well as for a cross, and rarely talks through the sequence of moves (a simple ""jab-hook-up-hook"" repeated during the first two or three times we do the move would be SO helpful. Instead, she cues it once, then usually uses very unhelpful 'cues' like ""ha!"" or some other vocalization that is meant to motivate, but can prove frustrating.Luckily, the moves aren't too hard to pick up."
4,Great Chair!,"So far, so good! I am in love with our new chair and it fits me perfect, but I must admit that it was made for shorter people. My husband (6'0'') does not quite fit as comfortably as me, but still enjoys the motion of the chair. He needs a few extra pillows to support his neck. This is a great chair!"
5,Inexpensive and Works Great!,"TOM Aquarium Flow Meter (measures 50gph to 250gph flow rate)Not many options out there for monitoring water flow(GPM)on aquarium filters....this little gem is worth it's weight in gold.Very inexpensive yet works as advertised.3/4"" hose barb fittings on each end or if you remove these adapters you have 3/4"" MPT (male pipe thread) to add your own fittings.I transitioned to 1/2"" hose barbs due to my tubing sizing from my Marineland C-220 canister filter that feeds this flow meter.These are vital for monitoring flow rate for UV sterilizers......that's what I'm doing.By adding a simple valve to the output you can control the flow rate to exactly what you need.I rate this item top notch for it price and performance.Easy to clean out also due to it's screw off cap."
4,Expandable filer,"Exactly what I needed BUT since the central section stands proud, rather than resting on the desk, it feels a little unstable. I'll watch how it goes..."
1,Rock Bland,"I bought this based on some of the reviews and some of the Amazon links, which implied if you liked groups like Athenaeum and Collapsis, which were excellent bands by the way, then you will love this. Unfortunately, they couldn't be more wrong. The lyrics and music are very unoriginal and lack depth. The songs aren't even catchy. I listed to this CD four times, which is my limit for giving things a chance, and nothing appealed to me. My high school band was more original than these guys. Do yourself a favor and check out Athenaeum, Collapsis, or Muse instead."
2,horrible,uhhhhhh maybe early nineties before other bands they woulda been a hit but now i can't believe i paid the $3.00 for this.
1,Blah,"This is the same stuff that the music industry keeps forcing down our throats. These guys need to get their own sound and stop stealing lyrics and riffs from sub-par, glam bands like Goo Goo Dolls and Matchbox 20.These guys are not good. I heard they broke up. Believe me, it was for the best. Thankfully, I will never have to listen to their music again."
5,Get acquainted with Cincinnati rock!,"Fantastic debut from the pride of Cincinnati, Pay the Girl. If you're looking for something new to listen to, with amazing vocals and outstanding songwriting, put this album in your shopping cart today! Freeze is just the tip of a musical iceberg; acute listeners will recognize the mysterious woman who is the subject of ""Clueless,"" and ""Beverly"" will remind you of those cute boys in bands that you used to have crushes on. ""Junkie"" will stay in your brain for months, just like a damned good drug. And so will this album... be the first on your block to be hip to Pay the Girl!"
4,Super Reader,"Interesting start with The Shadow and Cranston and an offer he couldn't refuse. Slower in the middle, and yet again Harry gets himself in a death trap and won't talk. The Shadow is also sneakier than the again very sneaky Chinese bad guy.A lot of Shadow action at the end that improves things, with a fight in some tunnels, and guns abounding, as the Shadow deals with his major enemy, Isaac Coffran."
4,Physcial Education for Elementary School Students,I have found it very helpful in my after school program
5,Excellent cliff notes source for family therapy theories,"This book is an excellent, succinct, well-organized source of family therapy theories. It is clearly organized with the most crucial information along with resources for additional reading. It is also organized for use in teaching family therapy theories. I found it to be a wonderful source to use in preparing for the MFT certification exam."
3,Single theme and single track,"Each of the Ryko The Atmosphere Collection discs (Day Cape Cod, Week Hawaii, Month Brazilian) has a single theme which continues for the whole 60 minutes. After you have heard the first raindrop, splash, or wave, just remember there is a whole hour of the same to come with only very slight variations. You cant jump forward because there are no tracks or index points.The signal to noise ratio, the sharp stereo imaging, and the full-range frequency response deliver very high quality recordings of authentic on-location sounds."
5,His name says it all,"One of the stellar players of the alto sax in the hard bop mode. Upward and onward, his playing pierces the complacency of mid-brow jazz, while gettin' down, down, down to the roots."
5,This will be a classic,"I am using Vestrup as a reference while I am using Bartles book as the main book for self study. I have to say, this book is great for self study. The author as indicated in his preface makes it accessible for most readers with some basic knowledge of analysis. The books is self contained and exhaustive with elaborate sections explaining hard to grasp topics."
5,George Washington Carver by Rackham Holt,This is an exceptionally well written biography of one of histories truly great scientists. The power of his intellect developed through many years of struggle and emerged to provide us and the World with a gentle giant. He was a scientist who had no limits to his capacity to study and contribute to all. This book served as a guide for my father who lectured to many audiences about the valuable accmplishments of Dr. Carver. We presented that book and my father's lecture notes to Tuskegee recently.
2,A good subject badly done,"I fondly remember reading a fascinating biography of George Washington Carver when I was much younger...this wasn't it.This book reads like a series of short anecdotes about Dr. Carver, with very little connecting them. It can be confusing with it's bad cohesion and tendancy to wander off track.I knew I was in trouble on page one when I couldn't figure out what year it was talking about. Paragraph one talks about the great news of the the 13th amendment ending slavery in 1865. Paragraph 2 and 3 talk about Dr. Carver being born in 1860 or '61, but it isn't clear that the narration has jump anti-chronologically here.I don't know what the target age is for this book. I think a High School Freshman could handle most of it. But I had to go to a dictionary to look up the word self-abnegation.My advice? Do read a biography of the great and fascinating scientist/naturalist George Washington Carver. Don't make it this one; there are better ones out there."
5,Study Guide T/A Abnormal Psych.,I received the Study Guide T/A Abnormal Psych: Science of Biology 3e/Sg by W.H. Freeman & Company. It was in good condition. I'm looking forward to the class.
5,How this booked helped me,"This book helped me to understand the deep-routed problems within my own personal space. Most of the people around me noticed a positive change thanks to this book, although not all (B.A.) would accept it. I would recommend this book to anybody who would like to gain a deeper understanding of psycology and the conditions surround the topic."
3,"Comer's ""Abnormal Psychology""","I purchased this book for a college course of the same subject. The cost was about 40.00 cheaper than the college bookstore, and I got it within 3 days, no hassles. The book was new so it was in great shape, however, it did not come with a CD as I thought it would and use of the website that accompanies the book is limited, unless your instructor opts to offer a hybrid class. The material is easy to read and follow, and is fairly up to date with only a few items that should be reviewed; such as current meds (a lot has changed recently), and some of the research seems dated. Otherwise I'm satisfied with my purchase."
2,abnormal psychology text,"the book is in very poor condition, there are many highlights and did not notify me of highlights in the book before I purchased it. When I purchased it, the arrival date was said to be two days later I received it a full month later. In which I no longer needed it because I had to purchase a different one because this one was late."
1,Never got book,I purchased the Abnormal Psychology Student Workbook from this buyer and never got my book!! I attemped to contact the seller and they would not respond to my emails. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS BUYER!
4,Great western entertainment.,We really enjoyed these movies. If you like westerns you will like them. If you like Kenny Rogers you will enjoy them too. They are as good as when they were made in the 80's. we sent to the U.S. for the dvd's as we couldn't get them in Australia. We have a dvd player that plays Zone 1 [U.S] as well as Zone 4[Aus]. Great family entertainment. Lots of action and fun. We want to get the other films in this series /I think there are 4 more. Lots of familiar faces in them too! You won't be dissapointed. Add them to your collection!
4,Connie Francis Sings Spanish,"I really enjoyed Connie's versions of Latin hits! There are only two singers/entertainers who really sing with their heart and mean it, and that it Connie Francis and Vikki Carr. Let's see a compilation album by the two artists together. Both of these superstars are still touring and have the fan base. I also hear that Vikki Carr is still winning Grammys even in the mid 90's! Let's get them together on CD!!! We still love you Connie!"
2,The rhythm is wrong; big disappointment,"I love Connie Francis in Italian, so I thought I would like this CD. And it's not her accent in Spanish that bothers me, it's the rhythm. I don't know if it is the fault of the arrangers or of Connie herself, but her boleros don't sound like boleros. If you want to hear an English-speaking singer who got it right, listen to Nat King Cole in Spanish! His accent is terrible, but his phrasing and sense of the Latin beat are perfect!"
2,Lots of small pieces,"To be exact, this is what you get:1 chimney2 vertical sign holders2 rood ridges2 tripple/flat6 roof slats (3 green+3 yellow)8 tripple round2 double & half20 doubles70 singles (barrels)I hope you like building with singles because there areNot very many big pieces.The set is wooden. The review saying that they are plastic is wrong."
3,30 years later and it's still kinda lame,"I never cared much for Lincoln Logs when I was a kid, but I thought my kids might like them. You never know, right? But it seems the same thing is true now as it was when I was a kid: Lincoln Logs are great if you like building log cabins, and only log cabins. And my kids don't seem to be terribly excited about building log cabins. As to the toy itself, the pieces are not constructed very cleanly, so the pieces don't hold together very tight. It's a decent toy, I guess, but just not our brand of fun."
3,ok,I think this was overpriced. I also thought I was purchasing the original Linclon Logs. These were plastic. Wouldn't buy again.
5,Great album,"This is a great album, but if you already have Shamanic Dream 1 or 2, you may want to pass on this one. It's very similar to the these."
5,Healing music,"I purchased this cd because we listened to it during a reiki class as our teacher was preparing us for meditation. It put all of us in a very relaxed state. I liked it so well I purchased it from, where else but Amazon. I listen to it in my SUV on my to and from work each day while traveling on the interstate. It calms me and when another driver acts a little crazy. it keeps me from getting as upset as I would otherwise. It is also helpful at bedtime to create a relaxing atmosphere."
1,Blah,"There is a reason you can't listen to samples of this CD. As an accomplished masseuse,I can say without reservation this CD is terrible,"
1,Dissapointing in all but a few areas.,"I ordered this book becuase it was the first available on Server+ but I wish I had waited. The book itself is all jumbled up with no coherence to the layout. If all of the needed information is included (which I doubt) finding some of it is difficult or impossible. Some of the authors anecdotes are completely unnecessary and the inclusion of a 70+ page glossary seems like overkill in a book of only 680 pages.Much of the information is very A+ esq and the coverage of network cards seems way too high. That said, the questions in the book do seem to match the CompTIA obejectives - I just have a feeling that if you are taking the test you would be better off with another book or a different resource.One other thing, the author information does not say he is Server+ certified which makes you wonder."
3,"Average..Nothing More, Nothing Less...","Really Average. Not bad for an intro book, though the writer's style is something that you would either love it or hate it. Don't know what the fuss is all about, but the RAID section is quite decent, with explanations on the seldom used RAID 2, 3, etc.Strange the author is not Server+ certified and that is a real bummer: How can he know what to expect from the exam and yet professing to teach you to get certified?Not as bad as some make out to be, but once you add the cost and compare what alternatives are out there, the inadequacy can really begin to show...."
1,SHOULD HAVE WAITED!,"I will make this brief.I bought this book because I wanted to start studying for this exam. I have been in the business for over 6 years now, and know mostly everything in here. However, I needed a book that would help me to remember all the finer points. I have typically always bought IDG (Hungry Minds) books, but this one was the first available...Now I know why! The book is not very well laid out, and the objectives don't seem to match the COMPTIA ones very well. I would advise everyone out there to wait for a better book to come along."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I'm usually quite fond of Sybex, but this book was really disappointing. It's basically a Network+ book with a little more info on clustering. If you want to learn more about servers, buy the Compaq ASE book from McGraw-Hill. You'll learn a lot more. The ASE book got bad reviews because Compaq updates their exams quarterly and by the time it was published it was out of date, but it's full of good info. If you've already studied for A+ and the Network+ tests you won't learn anything new from this book. You can learn more by going to Compaq's web site and taking advantage of their free web-based training."
1,I give this 0 stars if I could.,"This book is simply awful. The author makes a number of references to the fact that we are geeks. He may be, but I dont care for the assumption that I am. Does he think its cool to be a geek? You get the feeling that he doesnt, but uses it as a way to come down to other peoples level. This guy appears to have a very high opinion of himself. Add to that a plug for his wifes company on P228, pointless analogies and 17 pages of print out from a netware server configuration file which is useless irrelevant and meaningless. Sheesh. Be kind to your wallet and your brain. Buy something else."
1,Very Bad Server+ Book,"l bought this book long ago and only now have l read it and compared to other sybex books, this one is crap b/c the authors writing style is poor and annoying. Lots of pages l didn't even bother to read like the netware printout, his wife, his house and the glossary. Never again will l buy a book from this author and judging from the other reviews and the lack of books from him since then, this is a good thing. ls he even server+ certified?"
1,stay away,"This wonderful film is a total disaster in its DVD format. Frank Capra Junior calls it a restored print which is a joke. The film is often dark, details are hard to see and there are sprocket holes, white spots and all kinds of detractions in the film. How could Image and Capra release this mess on DVD! This outstanding film deserves much better than is offered."
3,Still worth a look!,"Sad to say, I have to agree with the previous reviews of the dvd. I saw this film on AMC years ago and recently rented the dvd, only to discover a somewhat inferior print. That's not to say, however, that it was unwatchable. ""Lady for a Day"" is still a great movie (way better than the watered-down remake ""A Pocketful of Miracles"") and deserves a larger audience. Until a better dvd master comes along, I'll endorse this one."
4,a too rarely seen depression-era goody,"this is the original version of frank capras better-remembered ""pocketful of miracles"", about a bag lady who has been sending her child to convent school in europe and is now faced with the prospect of her grown daughter coming to visit her supposedly grande dame mother in new york. the latter movie filled in alot of detail, but softened the sting of the depression-era original. i like both, but this is the better one."
4,A Mother's Lie for Her Daughter's Well-Being,"is the basis of this movie based on a Damon Runyon story. An old apple seller sent her daughter to the continent years ago, and has been writing her fantastical letters about a high society life she leads back in New York City. When the daughter writes that she will visit with her royal beau and his skeptical relative, the old woman is distraught. Here's where the colorful Runyon characters step in, and put together a sham high society life in hopes that the old lady will pass muster with the doubting relatives. Warren William headlines as the gambler who masterminds the charade, in a departure from his usual high society image he projects himself. May Robson brings real pathos to her role as the apple seller--there's a scene at the end when she greets guests at her charade reception where the glint of a tear in her eye brings a tear to yours, guaranteed."
2,Magnetic Chess Set / Not a recommended item,The item itself was very poor. The magnets on the pieces are not strong at all. The item seemed used with several scratches. The seller did try to rectify the purchase. Seller agreed the item may have had scratches in the board. I did not want a replacement since there is a very good chance another will arrive in the same condition. Shipping charge of the item was refunded by the seller without my request. Seller did try to accommodate the purchase - But item was just not as described.
4,Disco ball light,"I never write reviews, but I have to say I took a gamble and got this for my daughters birthday. It blew the lightbulb just like the other review stated, pretty much within 5-10 minutes. We just went to Home Depot the next day and got another bulb. It works great, just the initial bulb issue. I would just have another one handy so its not an initial disappointment if this does happen."
4,Good added lighting effect,"We have a DJ business, and have been using this product for over 10 years now.We use 2 of them sitting on our tower speakers as an added lighting attraction.We have just purchased our 4th one after all these years. They will last a long time if you take care of them.Big-C."
3,it worked fine till...,"it worked fine...till 5 minutes later the light bulb wasted i had to go buy a new light bulb and now it works fine, other than the cheap light bulb it brings its a good item"
5,Gift for my Granddaughter,Everything worked out of the box. My Granddaughter is delighted with it. Fast shipping and great product. It works great in a regular size bedroom.
1,"Arrived broken, junky product","It was cracked in 1/2 when it arrived. I'm surprised anyone gets it in one piece, junky product. I wouldn't waste my time."
1,Broken!,"We bought this as a birthday gift and when it was opened - it was broken inside the box. I am glad I also purchased a strobe light or the kids would have been so disappointed! And, instead of being able to exchange it - you can only return to amazon from this seller and there was no way to conact the seller to have them send us a working one."
1,Arrived inoperable,"Like a few reviewers I, too, had difficulties with the included bulb. I finally found a place that carried the bulb, screwed it in and eagerly turned on the machine to make sure it worked. The light came on in a pleasing glow then immediately popped into a cloud of smoke. When I unscrewed the bulb I noticed the socket was totally damaged. Could have saved myself a bulb had I double checked that first as the cause. Reordered a different model directly from Amazon. Hoping it arrives in time for daughter's slumber party Friday night. Bummer."
1,DISAPPOINTING,I would not say too much...It is just disappointing...It is not only a bad product with low quality but it is too expensive.
2,I'm Disappointed!!,"I read the reviews and decided to by this item anyway.... I recieved it with no instructions and no reciept inside of the box. I'm an online shopper and this stroke me as odd! Took the ball out of the box and set it on top shelf of my 20 monthe old baby's TV stand. I have cathedral ceilings so when I turned it on, I absolutely loved it its projection! However, when I returned to my baby's room in a couple of hours to check on him, I noticed the ball had stopped rotating!!!! I tried turning it off and then back on. It started rotating again but the rotation got slower by the second and shortly after, it stopped completely! It seems to me that the power generator isn't strong enough to rotate the big ball! I need a replacement and I hope the ball will be inspected before getting shipped out to me. If it wasn't for the defective malfunction, I'd give it 4.5 stars taking half a point away for the cheap quality of the item...."
1,The reviews are true about the bulb!,"Bought it for a small band gig we are gonna have. The package comes really secure and, as usual, amazon has been great with the shipping. The real problem I had was the bulb wasn't turning on THE FIRST TIME I tried it. The rotating ball is working so I figured out I just got a broken bulb. Bought a new bulb (bulb description at the bottom doesn't match the actual bulb you will need). Still wouldn't work. FML for throwing the box right away. Now I have this in my garage, useless"
2,Cheap and small - you get what you pay for,"In agreement with a previous review. These spoons are reasonably sturdy, but are very small -- the picture is a bit deceiving. You get what you pay for, what can I say?"
2,waaaay over priced,"I buy this exact same product at my local grocery store for $2.50. That being said, I buy them because I like them. I am looking for something better though. The wood these spoons are made out of is pretty soft and sometimes hard to clean. One of them even broke on me the other day."
5,GREAT SPOONS,This set of wooden spoons has worked great. My girlfriend loves to cook and bake so these were an ideal purchase. They are very sturdy and get the job done.
5,Good Quality,"I bought these spoons with the intention of using them for woodburning. But as far as wooden spoons go, these are smooth, clean, and sturdy. They seem to be very good quality."
1,terrible value,"Ok, so I bought these just to get my order up so I could get free shipping. I wish I had picked something else. They feel cheap. And, I went to Wal-Mart and saw the same brand in a set of 4 for less than half the price. So disappointing. I would return them, but it's too late now. I recommend getting something else. These are not good quality utensils and you can get them cheaper elsewhere."
5,The best fastener I purchased this year,"First, I use this to organize utility closets with all kinds of ethernet cables hanging all over the place. These are great for holding down a single cable, but I use these to attach a wire tie, and then use a second wire-tier to attach a bundle of wires. It has brought great organization to my utility closet cleanups.The best part of this product is the dual head where you can use a phillips screwdriver bit or use a nut driver. I put the proper nut driver on my portable drill and I was pop these things in in seconds without fuss or waste. No stripped phillips grooves in those hard to reach places.I suggest anyone who works with cables that need to be kept orderly consider keeping a bag of these in their inventory."
1,98 not the 100,their was 98 clips out of 100 Mounting clips in the 100pack i got. that is why i gave it a 1 on it rateing
5,Most useful financial video I have seen yet!,Paul Merriman does a great job of providing useful information in a way that even I can understand!After watching the video I know exactly how to apply his methods. Enhanced index funds are a great investment that I have applied to my IRA and I recommend them to anybody looking for a way to boost returns in their IRA or 401k plan.
3,Tight fitting.,"I do not know if it is my feet, but I found this shoe to be very uncomfortable to wear. I tried stretching it, but alas it is just there watching me. I am very disappointed with this purchase. It was a waste of my money. it is a beautiful shoe. What a waste!"
4,Perfect Title,"Having grown up as a ""downwinder"" from Hanford I could relate to the author's story.She did a good job of sharing what it was like to grow up in rural America in the 50's and 60's, as well as telling an eye opening part of American history that most people know nothing about. My sister is living it, having gone through surgery for radiation created thyroid cancer two years ago."
5,Chipped 1.8T,"As others have said, this is a great plug of the VW/Audi 1.8T engine that has been chipped for higher boost. Gap to .28 and run them. They are hard to find at any parts store, I keep hearing ""I can see that NGK makes them but I can't order them."" Thanks amazon."
5,warm and fits well,This was a gift for my running partner. She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness.
3,Nice vest but cut small,"This vest is as advertised but is very small for it's rated size. I had to return the vest as it was just too small and out of stock larger. I would say it is a medium or maybe large at best, certainly not an XL by most standards. Quality seemed fine."
4,"Nice vest, good price.","I bought this vest for my Mom. I ordered it in Pink grapefruit, but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful, rich color. My Mom loved it, the fit was perfect for her, and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely. The fleece is soft and thick, and it looked very attractive on her. A good buy for the price."
1,UNoriginal!!!,"A straight guy who wants to have a female-dominant threesome? Let's see: this has already been done in ""Trois"" and ""Just One Time."" Just as those movies stunk, so does this one. This movie could have been called ""The Look-alike Film."" The main character looked like he could have been Brendan Fraser's fatter brother. The Spanish student was obviously a Penelope Cruz imitation. In fairness, one guy may have been the actual tattooed guy from ""Oz,"" the one on death row.This film says it has ""sexual content,"" but it could have run on non-cable TV. There is no nudity whatsoever. The plot is predictable. I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment. This work really and truly lacked redeeming qualities."
1,really terrrible...,download was irratic and at best horrible. did not enjoy this experience and will not do it again... a waste of money.and only windows as an option to download...pooh! again... not an experience i'll repeat.
1,Had to stop on the first scene,"Opening scene: A classroom teacher burning the American Flag. :(Then one student rightfully complaining and the plot seems to take a turn into another student self described as a social democrat that adds to the insult, and the professor tells her she said ""positive"" comments."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Enjoyable film, focusing on the emotional dynamics of a threesome. Darrell Hammond is good in a supporting role. This was an engaging film and is the most honest portrayal of this type of relationship that I have seen."
2,Not that great.,I didn't really enjoy this. thought it was a waste of time and money. Kind of dragged on too much.
2,A Journey With a Thousand Different Directions,"This book had so much potential to be far more than what it was. I agree with other customers who said it started off well, but all of sudden there were so many U-turns and loops and twists that it seems as though the writers were still brainstorming what they wanted to do with all the information they had. It was poorly written and it takes away what probably could have been a journey worth reading. I think maybe Lula should have considered someone else to do her biography. Either these writers were inexperienced or had too many projects on their plates and just stuffed this one in."
2,"Blind Faith: The Miraculous Jouney of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother","Interesting only to a point. Lula plays off her sons leaving us hanging. By the time I finished the book, any compassion I had for her story was lost in the repeated saga of her own self egotisim."
3,Interesting Story,"Lula's story was truly heartbreaking. She endured so much adversity in her life. Stevie's success was really a ""blessing"" for the entire family to come out of proverty and for her to accept the fact that his visual impairment was not a hindrance to his happiness.Stevie's story is remarkable as well. He began an extremely talented young boy that just wanted to play his music and enjoy his life the best he could. I am truly proud of his accomplishments. One thing that could have been better for the story overall is a better ending!It ended somewhere in the eighties for Stevie and did not mention what ever came of his siblings. A good read though, and gives a pretty good overview of how Stevie came to be the great artistic genius that he is"
3,A biography that lost its way,"This began as an excellent biography of a woman who has an important story to tell. But Lula got lost after Stevie started recording. Granted, the table of contents says Part II is about Stevie. But the covers says, ""An Authorized Biography of Lula Hardaway."" I wanted to know where Lula was during Stevie's teenaged years. We suddenly find she's in a second marriage and has more kids. Then we learn she's divorced (for a second time--we never learned about the first divorce, either) and living in Los Angeles. The ending brought her back briefly, and reminded us of her message. I would have liked the whole book to be about her, as the cover promised. She deserved it."
3,Road not Taken,"This one started out so well. A fascinating life story which then morphed into the biography of a son. I picked it up on sale thinking it looked really interesting...and it was...at first. I was disappointed when Lula, the subject of the biography, was forgotten as soon as Stevie signed with Motown. We no longer have Lula's biography, we have ""Stevie Wonder: The Early Years"". After the Stevie section started we merely get asides mentioning that Lula is divorced, Lula is remarried, Lula is divorced, again. Not what I signed up for when I started reading it."
5,Loving Blind Faith,I've read 10 chapters and am loving Blind Faith. It's intimate details of the life of Stevie Wonder and his mother are fascinating. I am captivated by the courage his mom had shown. This book seems honest and has a lot of great descriptions. I highly recommend it.
1,Praying for an Update,This program would not work with my high-speed computer. It needs a serious updating. I am disappointed.
3,Bas Rutten,I mean Enough said Even though Bas was in it for like a minute it was worth it movie overal was ok but a must have for any bas rutten fan.
5,PERFECT,OUR QUEEN SHOWS THE BRAZILIAN ALL THESE LATIN AMERICA FIRST ALBUM IN SPANISH ON THE CHILD BE GOOD is
1,Best of Nina Simone,"I was looking for 1 song. I got that, of sorts. The rest was not what I wanted or even liked. I did not enjoy the CD at all."
4,Great Writing,"Timeless western stories by a gifted writer - a man who knew the people, loved the country and lived the life. No other writer has captured so well the speech and the character of the often flinty, often twinkle-eyed men who lived on the rough edges of the New Mexico frontier."
5,Fixed an apparent leakage,"I decided I might need a new gas cap on my 5-year old Camry when I noticed that in colder weather after a 15-20 mile trip, a circle of condensation would form on the OUTSIDE of my fuel tank door that roughly corresponded to the location and shape of my fuel tank cap. My thoughts were, Oh great, what next? Check engine light? Failed emissions inspection? Since either of those are major inconveniences for me I decided to proactively replace the fuel tank cap. I no longer can detect the ring of condensation after a trip on a cold day so I can only conclude the gas cap is an improvement over the old one. In summary: product expectations satisfied, and, hopefully, inconveniences staved off!"
2,Stant 10834,"Does not fit 1999 Miata as described, cannot close the gas lid without damaging it, the flange on the cap is too tall?"
1,Didn't help,"I bought this to replace my original fuel cap to eliminate check engine issue. However, this fuel cap didn't help and the error codes re-appeared.I bought another fuel cap from Napa and that solved the problem!"
4,perfect fit,"Replaced a broken fuel cap, works perfectly fine. What else is there to say? You need a gas cap for a Suzuki, this might be your ticket."
1,Doesn't Work on Our Escape!,"Before I ordered this cap, I checked twice times to make sure it would fit my 2006 Ford Escape. Got the cap quickly, but there was no packing slip or paperwork of any kind in the box. Put it on the Escape and it worked ok for a few miles. Then, the gas cap light came on and stayed on! After that, the check engine light came on and stayed on. My husband tossed the box in the trash before I could get the info off of it. We are going to replace it with another one that will work, probably from the Ford dealer. Very disappointed!"
2,Never received order,Ordered this item on May 5th and never received it. When I emailed the sender they apologized which was nice but I never got my book.
2,Defective out of the box,"Right out of the box, the tuner was defective. On both AM and FM, there was an extremely annoying ""POP!"" sound every five seconds. As a test for the problem, if you leave the AM antenna disconnected and turn up the volume, it's very obvious. When the AM and FM antennas are properly connected, you won't hear it so much on loud music, but during quieter passages the five second interval click is a real nuisance.The Sony support website Knowledge Article C399832 for ""Popping or clicking noise when playing the radio"" suggests unplugging the unit for a minute and then plugging it in again, but that didn't help. The suggestion in that case is ""service may be required"". I also called the Sony 800 number and spoke to a service rep who admitted that the unit needed repair. Well, since I only bought it last night, it's obviously going back to the store.File this one in the Sony junk product category..."
2,MK3,"Wow this sucks pretty bad, i liked mk2 on gameboy and thought if anything this would be an impove ment. I was wrong... everything moves god awful slow and moves are so easy to do. I thought nintendo would have not edited this game (unlike the first 2 mk games) and put some blood in, it even had an M rating , but once again i was wrong. No blood no guts, isn't that what set MK apart form most fighting games?? The graphics aint bad and neither is the music, but the gameplay ruins all that in a heart beat. dont't even bother.,....."
2,2nd Worst Old School MK Gameboy Game,"I purchased this awful gameboy game 15 years hoping it would be as good as it's predecessor-but no such luck!MK3 does'nt have a link cable option(like it's 2 predecessors before)nor does it have any SGB enhancements(border,color,sound).Though it incorporates the same digitize graphics and sound as Gameboy's THQ's Super Return Of The Jedi-which 2 sucked.Nevertheless,pick up MK2 instead."
1,All the reviews make it sound good,I'm ordering this game on super NES on Ebay. It's only $3. I heard it was good so I want it. I'm also buying Ultimate MK3 and MK Annihilation. It's only $5 all together. I'm SO MAD that Baraka isn't in it. At least Kung Lao is in it. I like his friendship where he throws his hat like a frisbee. Nightwolf's friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers. I like Sindel's animality. I am SO buying this game.
5,Impressive and Mystical,This is THE MOST mysterious and the most charming music that one might find the Sufi Filed.
3,Good collection of lecture notes: Extremely Over-Hyped,"I have never seen any book as over-hyped as this one. It is a good collection of lecture notes and that's what it is. IT IS NOT A BOOK: a collection of lecture notes. It throws jargon words on you without explaining them. This cruelty starts from page one. Overall: not enough depth and explanation. Instead, lots of fluff in the name of Humor. Especially if you are a beginner to EJB, this is not the book for you.Sounds like, when it comes to the humor the authors are only targetting the American audience and ignoring the global audience. Even from American standard, I find this humor CORNY at best.In the past, you did not have a choice because this was the only book on this exam. But now you do have a choice. So shop around before making the decision."
3,Good Introduction to EJB,This is a pretty good book for someone who is just starting ejb programming .But it is no replacement for 'Enterprise java Bean'3rd edition.
4,Good Book to learn the basics,"Overall a very good book in the context of Fundamentals and objectives of the exam SCBCD. I am giving it 4 stars because I felt that an ""Exam Quick Prep"" at the end would have helped in the last minute studying for the exam. I also think that giving a flavour of design patterns would have been beneficial..Having said that, for the advanced readers in my opinion Richard's ""Enterprise Java Beans"" is more applicable and interesting.IMHO EJB Learning curve1.)Kathy's Book ""Head First EJB""2.)Enterprise Java Bean OR Mastering Enterprise Java Beans3.)J2EE Design and Development by Rod Johnson"
3,Just good enough for the exam,"This book written in the Headfirst style is good enough to get you through the SCBCD exam sucessfully. Unfortunately the book contradicts it's self in quite a few places and barely ever goes into the details of why things are organized the way they are. It has many errors too, so be sure to check the errata on the oreilly website. It is by no means enough for an EJB developer and it has even not enough information on the EJB spec."
2,An Optical Cacophony,"The book helped me in passing the exam. However it was quite hard to learn from a book with such a confusing layout. During the first reading it is quite entertaining. But beware, if you have to lookup some forgotten facts. The index is poor and you have to skim through crazy cartoons and handwritten poorly organized notes. Frequently I gave up searching for some facts. So the 'head first' approach is definitely not for me. After passing the exam I gave tho book to someone else, because I didn't want to store such an optical cacophony on my bookshelf."
5,Thanks For The Spread Awareness,"So many books (too many books) forget that people who are studying using a book look at one spread (two pages) at a time. After reading through HFE (twice!), then going back to some of my other books, I've become spoiled! Some books take the linear approach (write the whole dang book and let some mindless word processor paginate it). I guess one might guess that I don't appreciate that approach very much. It's obvious that with HFE, there was a lot of careful thought about what made-up the page / spread. I image discussions about maybe we have some extra room here, we could talk about this or that related thing. Or blast! We're running out of room here. I'd like to talk about this or that, but we need to be really tight here. Or, this is important enough to justify another page or two. Let me say that this makes the book much more pleasing and effective as a study guide than one with that linear approach."
3,Too big .,This is a book for somebody who wants to learn abc of ejb.I think it is too big for a certification guide 700 pages.People with some previous experience will get very frustrated.very very slow.no patterns.very little code.better read the spec.Mastering ejb 2nd edition is much better.
5,Very Enjoyable and Informative,"I recently opened the books (both, The Servlets book and the EJB book) to reread a few chapters here and there to refresh my memory. I enjoyed every minute and had a hard time putting the books aside.Many reviewers have written about the ""Head First""'s refreshing style. Among other things, part of this success I attribute to the ""No Dumb Questions"" sections: the authors keep impressing me with their ability to anticipate not so superficial questions popping in my head as I read or re-read the books some time later. My wishes for the 2nd editions: more detailed indexes and hard covers."

5,Crystals For Healing,The reason I bought this book was because of the emphasis on healing. It works! Buy it. Try it. You will be glad you did!
5,Love this Crystal Book,"I have had the rare pleasure of reading the best book on Crystal Magick ever authored. Bravo. The author has accomplished the impossible. Creating a book that is both interesting, informative and better than all Crystal books available. Thank you author."
5,Crystals for Welsh Magick,"I have lived in North Wales for over nineteen years. When I first learned of this book I was skeptical - I mean here is an American - a Yank! - writing about US!!!But after I bought it and read it. I think it is one of the best books on the Pagan Welsh Crystal magick there is.Please read it if you have the bob to buy it. It is worth it.Crystal Magick, Gods and Goddesses, crystal ritual, its all there.I have it sitting on my altar and use it constantly."
5,A good place to start,"This is the first cd I ever bought of Ella. I was doing a musical tour of great singers and decided to give her a chance. I found myself listening only to this cd, over and over. I couldn't believe that there was someone so good that I didn't know. My favorite song on the cd (and this is hard choice) is ""Travelin' Light."" Incandescent. Tender. Achingly pure. This cd is a really good place to start learning about Ella the ballad singer versus Ella the scat singer. Well worth the investment!"
3,its ok,"I don't think marion (suger) knight needs anymore money. they did an ok job. they have some classics by Pac, Dre,Snoop and Warren G, Etc but i think that this label has no more life left in them. they now have Petey Pablo who is well crap and thats about all they have now. So if your a big fan of the row then you should get it but if you want a real cd then get a 2pac cd instead,RIP Tupac Amaru Shakur."
4,Disappionting,"This dual disc re-release of ""The very best of Death Row"" needs improvement. The dvd side contains 7 videos including ""Regulate"" by Warren G and nate Dogg, ""California Love"" By Tupac and Dr Dre and 5 others and although it is a great buy, it is missing one essential video on the dvd side, ""Afro Puffs"" by The Lady Of Rage. Rage was one of Death Row's most underrated musicians but if Death row is going to give us the song, give us the video, too. If they were to re-release this dual-disc with the video to ""Afro Puffs"" then it would be worth buying"
2,Greatest Hits?,"i think this album is just suge trying to get death row back on the scene. it has some classic tracks on it, but where is 'Wit Dre Day' 'How Do U Want It' 'What Would U Do' 'Who Am I' 'Murder Was The Case' 'Natural Born Killaz' and many others that should always be mentioned when u talk about death rows greatest hits.If you don't know what death row is about then just look at their back catalogue and you will see classic albums, too many to truly make a greatest hits album that would have every classic track on it. this album is just a money spinner for suge. i suggest buying 'The Chronic' 'Doggystyle' 'All Eyez On Me' 'Dogg Food' & some more of the back catlogue and have a classic collection of your own.R.I.P. Tupac Shakur"
4,THE VERY BEST OF THE DECADE PAST !,"IT IS VERY STRANGE TO CALL THESE SONGS OLD.BECAUSE HOW MANY PEOPLE STILL LISTEN TO THEM TODAY.BUT IT WAS 10+ YEARS AGO DR.DRE CHRONIC ALBUM CAME OUT IN 92`AND SNOOP DOGG 1st CD IN 94`AND THE REST OF THE DEATH~ROW CREW ALONG WITH 2~PACRULED THE 90'S WITH STRONG RAP FLOW & HARD~CORE RHYMES.AND HARD HITTING BASS BEATS FOR YOUR 15~INCH SUBS.THE REASON TO BUY THIS DUAL~DISC IS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL HITSWE ALL KNEW AND LOVED.AND HAD GREAT PARTYS & MEMORYS TO.AND THE VIDEO'S ON THE DVD SIDE. WERE THE ONES WE COULD NOT WAITTO COME ON MTV EVERY DAY.NOW WE GET TO OWN THEM.THE REASON I GAVE THIS 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5 IS THEY SHOULD HAVEMADE THIS A 2~DISC PACKAGE.DEATH~ROW MAY BE A RECORD LABEL GONEDOWN HILL.BUT THEY LEFT A PILE OF HITS BEHIND THAT WILL BE PLAYED ON STEREO'S UNTIL THE SUN BURNS OUT !!!{TONY~TONI~TON`E}/MELBOURNE,FLORIDA/[2~PAC R.I.P.]"
3,not as good as i expected,"i only tried the fudge ones, and decided not to try the rest. i found them to be a bit dry and WAY too sweet. it wasn't stale or anything though."
5,the best cookies and brownies ever,Someone sent a sampler pack of cookies and brownies as a gift. They came in attractive wrapping. They were fresh and incredibly delicious! Highly recommended- a great treat!
1,A beautiful album terribly remastered,"The music here is unique, subtle, intense, and very beautiful ... but this ""remaster"" is appalling. Muddy, like a non-Dolby cassette with the Dolby turned on; detail gets lost in the murk. And the master tapes sound damaged, particularly during the first track (lots of breakup). I have a 15 year old tape of this album, and my cassette sounds better than this CD. Very disappointing."
3,Caution! Song list at the bottom is not for this CD!,"There is a song list on this page with 24 songs however these are NOT the songs on this CD! Look at the image of the CD case - there is a song list on the backside starting with ""In the year 2525"". These are the songs that are really on this CD. Some of the songs are OK but only 6 of the songs on the web page list are on the CD so it is not as good as I thought it was going to be when I ordered it."
4,"""Root"" is a Hilarious Schlep through Unified Europe","Great series, but you'll need to follow the dialogue carefully to fully appreciate the humour and British expressions. Maybe a bit tough on Americans, but certainly worth a try. One should probably be knowledgable about the time (pre-Unification Europe), as it was quite topical when it was produced."
2,Buy the book instead,"I know, I know. A book and a video are two different art forms and you shouldn't compare them to each other. But after reading the utterly hilarious book based on this series, the actual video was a disappointment. Slow and boring describe it best. Natually the video can't introduce Root's interior dialogues, so we're left with minimal dialogue. Also, some episodes (in the book with pictures) were apparently edited out of the video. Too bad -they were hilarious. Stick to the printed word on this one if you want hysterically cutting British sarcasm."
5,my favorite books,"I've read this book a long time ago and loved it. this time I bought for my son. We both read and it is still one of favorites of Durrell. Funny, smart, and easy to read. My son (12) loved it also. He've read the funniest parts outloud to his younger brother and they both laughted so hard!"
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I['ve read many of his books and liked them very much. I considered this one sily fluff and I didn't finish it.
3,Aiwa XD DW-1,"The screen is a little too small for adequate viewing. Due to it's panoramic size, viewing letterbox DVD's results in distortion of the image by lateral stretching. The unit has a large, heavy, cumbersome NiMH battery that doesn't last long enough to view two decent size movies. It may be worthwhile spending a little more to get a better unit."
3,probably worth it at 400 bucks,"the aforementioned criticismis true. I could not get through ONE movie on a plane let slone two. It works excellently as a home player, though and when plugged in can go to a friend's house and hook up easily. very easy to use."
2,DAR WIILIAMS and the Bearsville Massacre....,"I love Dar Williams but I'm afraid she got it all wrong in this concert. Even the audience couldn't muster much enthusiasm for her introspective, half-hearted folk-rap... OK to tell stories, OK to sing songs but Dar, don't try doing both together. Disjointed and un-moving. Not art.Spend your money on ""My better self"" instead. Sorry Dar! Simon"
4,A singular presence,"Fascinating flutist's (amongst other) final (close enough) concert is a bittersweet pleasure of nonthreatening Avant-Jazz, not devoid of formulaic trappings but mostly far past them with Dolphy's touchingly fluid work and serviceable backup."
4,must read for all investors.,"here's a book thats entertaining as well as informative. if you had read this book before the stock market crash of 2000, you would have realized that people have been exhibiting this sort of frenzied behavior for centuries.You would've also recognized the frothiness in the real estate market in California in 2005 and exited the market. I did. This book saved me over a $100,000!A must-read book for any investor."
2,Comments on Crowd Madness,"Was disappointed that so much of the original book was left out in order to focus on investor psychology. MacKay was a master of crowd psychology in its many forms, in addition to investment matters."
2,This book is an example of a popular delusion...,"This was recommended by some famous people as a ""must read"" for serious investors. The people who rant and rave about how great this book is must have only read the inside jacket. There is 160 pages on the Alchymists alone, which like most of the book, could have been summed up in a third of the space. This book is so stretched out it's ridiculous, I'm willing to bet 90% of those who attempt to read it never finish. I'm warning you now, as an avid reader of financial books, this is one of the slowest reads you will ever encounter.......ugh."
2,Extraordinary Popular Delusions (Harriman House),"Purchased this book because the Table of Contents under Browse Sample Pages showed the full content of the book. However, the Harriman House Classics hardcover edition only has three of the chapters."
3,It's only a slice of the book!,"I first discovered this book 40 years ago, and especially loved its description of the witchcraft hysteria. This is a lovely little edition, but it is only a small subset of the entire work, dealing specifically in three economic bubbles. It would have been good reading in 2000."
2,Very Abridged,"This is only a small sampling (3) of the stories in the original text- The Mississippi Scheme, the South Sea Bubble and the Tulipomania. If you is only interested in reading the Tulipomania, then this book is for you."
3,"Sometime Tedious, But Worth Reading","I found reading this book a mixed experience. Some chapters: ""The Mississippi Scheme"",""The South Sea Bubble"", and ""The Tulipomania"" were very interesting and describe behavior common with recent financial crises. ""The Crusades"" describes a time when Christendom waged ""jihad"" on the muslums of the Holy Lands. ""The Witch Mania"" describes how this fearful and violent superstition lingered into the eighteenth century, centuries after the Modern Era is considered to have begun. And ""Duels and Ordeals"" describes the suprisingly destructive effect of dueling on the higher classes of European society into the early nineteenth century. Yet other chapters seemed very tedious to read, with ""The Alchymists"", 200 pages of repetition, being the most tedious. On balance, though, this is a book worth reading."
1,NO TABLE OF CONTENTS OR INDEX,"How can a book like this possibly be published without a table of contents or an index? Unbelievable. I've never heard of such a thing. Unless you want to read it cover to cover, which I never intended to do, pass on this one."
2,Boring and Overrated,"After hearing about this book for a long time, I recently read it. Mackay's book consists of one anecdote after another...for more than 700 pages. It offers very little in the way of analysis and explanations. If you like that kind of book, this one is for you.I found this book boring and very overrated. I suggest that you skim a copy of this book before you buy it. After skimming it and getting a feel for what it contains, the chances are good you won't bother to buy it."
4,Have a good English dictionary at your side...,"This is a fascinating book, once you can decipher the Chaucer-like English that Mackay uses. Keep in mind this book was written 160 years ago! I'm 30 and I have a Bachelor of Science degree and still have to look up one or two words per page. Some paragraphs I had to read twice to understand. It ain't Dr. Seuss we're reading here!If you can put up with ye olde English then this book does make for a fascinating tale of how fads develop and multi-level-marketing schemes are born. The stories can teach us why chain e-mail will never die and why the ""dinner parties"" of 1999 sprang up."
3,The Critics are Delusional,"This book is simply overrated. It made a justifiably big splash when it first came out as it was the first book of its kind, but it would better be regarded as a classic than a current, practical discourse on the subject matter. The topics covered in the book are comically broad, ranging from financial bubbles to the evolving role of facial hair in society, and there is no obvious direction the reader is being led. I found the author's treatment of the subject matter to vary from an almost mockingly humerous satirical style to the historian's painful detailing of mindless minutia necessitating a quick couple page flips here and there. Yes, there is an interesting collage of bits and pieces to be found here, however the book more resembles the ramblings of a hermitic professor than something I would recommend to someone seriously seeking to expand their knowledge."
3,For history buffs,"An interesting book for history buffs.For those interested in the history of financial manias, only the first three chapters are of interest. If you are not a history buff, even these chapters are much too detailed."
3,Extraordinary Popular Delusions,"This book was delayed, and by the time I was notified of the delay, it was too late to cancel the order and reorder somewhere else. It was also the abridged edition. I would have preferred the unabridged edition."
3,Having trouble sleeping?,"This is a great sleep aid. Too long, and he uses too many complicated words when simple ones would have worked just as well. I suggest skimming through it instead of trying to read it cover to cover. It contains some interesting information about alchemy, haunted houses, the crusades and other things, but you have to wade through his verbage and unneccessary details to get to it."
1,Catholic Christians Beware!,"Mackay's anti-Catholic bigotry is well documented, and in this tome he leaves no opportunity to bash the ""Romish Church"" unexploited. I found the instances of anti-Catholicism in the book to be a major distraction from the rest of the content contained therein. In my mind such close-mindedness has a deleterious effect on the author's credibility."
3,"Interesting, but not compelling reading...","The book contains numerous interesting anecdotes. If you are interested in Social History and Psychology, there is plenty to mull over. However, it is too long-winded and laborious to read."
1,No Table of Contents,"If the delivered product does not contain a TOC, do NOT advertise it on the Amazon site. A book of this type is difficult to read as is...to not include a TOC is ridiculous, even at .99 cents."
2,"Starts good, but lacking overall","This book starts off fairly interesting enough with stories about delusions that captivated societies to the point of delusion. But somewhere along the way, maybe alchemy, the author decided to make expansive listings of people conducting such activities upon a given population. Talk about dry and really not important to the overall concept of the book. Many of these sections could have continued in the telling of a story to accent the main point.While one can dig out the gems in this book, buy this book only if you have time to dig them out. And even then, there are only a few of them.Good book for reference at best, but one not worth all the time for reviewing short burst of interesting reading."
4,Classic,"This makes for troubling reading in today's world for financial upheaval, but reading it in today's world is all the more necessary. Compelling, entertaining, informative, I enjoyed every page."
5,"Social history of crowd mentality, not only about stocks","Most people know this book is a classic -- but it's unfortunate that it's thought of as a book about investments, when investments are really only a small part of the phenomena Mackay covers. We have all heard about Dutch tulips a million times over -- it is therefore much more interesting to read Mackay's chapters about popular slang expressions, or about superstitions, or about quack medicine. There are great micro-histories here about the comings and goings of fads, both those contemporary to Mackay and those that preceded him.While Mackay's points about the irrationality of crowds are useful for the investor, these ""lessons"" about Dutch tulips and other financial manias are cliches today. You need not read this book to find out about them. This book's true value lies in its comprehensive history and analyses of other fads, hoaxes, and ""manias,"" most of which have, fittingly enough, been forgotten today."
4,Skeptic? Believer?,"Whether you are a skeptic or a believer, whether you believe some of it, none of it, or all of it, this book is a fun read."
5,A great Book about my area,"MY father saw this UFO years ago and said it was real, now I can read about it. The book is like an adventure story and I would reccomend it to anyone"
2,A conglomeration of related sightings,"The experiential information described in the book is interesting enough but gets rather tiring about half way through as witnesses describe more of the same lights proceeding southwest or northeast, moving up and down, blinking, etc, etc. If you're someone who has long gotten over the notion that THERE ARE UFO's then this reading will seem like one, long, run-on report from numerous witness about the strange lights and craft they observed in the mostly night skies of northern New York state. This book is synonymous and a good companion to ""Phoenix Lights"" where onlookers marvel at the appearance of symetrical arrangements of mysterious lights in the night sky. Some of the sightings are quite compelling but, once again: Yeah, and ???????"
1,The original investigators of the New York UFO,"Unfortunatly, being one of the original investigators when the UFO ""hysteria"" began in New York, the whole story can be seen from a different viewpoint than what has been reported. Sometimes for reasons that should be left unjudged, objects or experiences that people think they are experiencing can be interpreted to be that person's reality or judgement skill. There are many other real stories behind the Nightsiege of New York. Many stories can be interpreted in ways to meet ones own goal, or maybe provide the need for that fifteen minutes of fame. People maybe saw what they think they saw. As for one of the original investigators, who also saw these objects and found them identifiable, and who also was one of the original writers and researchers I find now I that I have grown up, I am too old for fairy tales."
2,Well...,This is a great old TV series and certainly an asset to my vast collection. I expected digitally mastered though and quality is far less than I thought it would be. Picture is fuzzy and sound is awful.
4,Timeless,Flash Gordon is a notion. Very well made and very much ahead its time looking into the future we now live in:-)
3,Flash Gordon: Space Soldiers Conquor the Universe,"The three-star rating is not for the writing or production values, but for the nostalgic fun the adventure brings. This is only for fans of the series. A torchlight search amid glaciers is done well enough to belong in a better movie, but such things as sputtering spaceships and the unintentionally funny ""mechanical men"" are what we really watch the twelve episodes for. Charles Middleton as Ming the Merciless is a memorable villain without any discernable acting, and Buster Crabbe as always makes a credible, intelligent action hero."
3,Back to the Saturday Matinee,"This serial ran in theaters then was resurrected on television back in the 1950s. It disappeared and finally, thanks to DVDs, it has reappeared to be viewed in the comfort of ones home. The picture quality is very good, but not great. This does not deter from the fun of watching this dated but enjoyable serial. The one complaint I have is it is not clear how to navigate to the second half of the episodes. The episodes are divided into two halves, six at a time. It's a bit confusing finding how to get to the second six. Still, once you've got that down, it becomes a pleasure to watch Buster Crabbe work his way through all those cliff hanging episodes. The most fun is to simply watch one episode a night or week, then come back for more.It's a way to go back to the past and see just how silly some serials can be and still have a wonderful time watching!"
3,Go get 'em Flash,"Flash Gordon is certainly the true precursor to ""Star Wars."" Image Entertainment is distributing four feature length titles edited down to about 90 minutes from the original four hour serial length. Zippy plots, lots of action, clever sets and surprisingly strong scripts do justice to ""THE PERIL FROM OUTER SPACE,"" ""THE PURPLE DEATH FROM OUTER SPACE,"" ""SPACE SHIP TO THE UNKNOWN"" and ""THE DEADLY RAY FROM MARS.""Good stuff that looks even better when cut down to the central plot. The action does not let up. See the whole series in order.Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe is charismatic and strangely beautiful as the lead in this beguiling comic book space opera from the late 30s.For die hard fans of this series, the full length, uncut serial ""FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE"" is also available."
4,OF MING AND MONGO,"WE GOT OUR FIRST TELEVISION AROUND 1950. I WAS 8 YEARS OLD. TO ME, THIS FLASH GORDON SERIAL WAS SOMETHING FANTASTIC. I BELIEVE IT WAS ON DAILY ON THE DUMONT CHANNEL. MY FRIENDS AND I WOULD IMAGINE OURSELVES INVOLVED IN THE ACTION. WHAT ELSE WAS THERE? I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SERIES NOW IN 50 YEARS. FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT, IT REALLY SEEMS STILTED AND CONTRIVED. HOWEVER, IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF A MORE INNOCENT TIME WHEN THE VIDEO AND SOUND EFFECTS WERE REALLY THRILLING AND THE ACTING JUST THE BEST! I REALLY, REALLY HATE THAT MING!!!"
3,Flash will have you on the edge on your seat !,"Originally seen in theaters as a weekly serial, Flash, Dale, Doc and Ming were around way before George Lucas ever dreamed of Star Wars. The special effects may seem dated (however, the man who made the rocket ships fly in this serial also was still around and made ""Bruce"" the shark in Jaws)and each segment ends with a cliffhanger. Flash returns, though, to save the day. Somewhat campy but well worth watching !"
2,Worth a few laughs,"Bad acting, shallow characters, ridiculous costumes (whatever they could dig up from Robin Hood), cheap sets (the spacecraft only have one seat!), and ludicrous special effects add up to a camp classic.I can't stand sitting thru more than 2 episodes at once (there are twelve total).These episodes were originally intended to be viewed as serials at theaters in ""Matinee"" format... you would see one new 20 minute episode a week, with a cliffhanger at the end of each one - the problem is, when you can see the episodes ""back to back"", the cliffhanger resolutions can be seen as the true ripoffs that they were, as they never quite match up with the impossible-to-escape cliffhanger shown from the week before (the writers figure that after a week's time you'll have forgetten what they showed you the week before).At least the ""evil"" Sonja is pretty hot... and Ming makes a pretty good ""bad guy""."
1,Save your money!!,"I bought this on DVD and expected a professional package I expect of any DVD package. Here's the news...terrible packaging, no extra features, no cinemascope so you can't even read the credits, the poorest quality I have seen and overall unwatchable product. I feel as if I was robbed of my money. The people that made this product wanted to sell you something but you will never buy anything else. I say wait for someone who cares to release these great serials."
2,cheap cardboard box,This item is junk. It is a cheap cardboard box. With the cost and the shipping I ended up paying $10.00 for this. We would have been better off just purchasing a plastic container.
2,What a Jerk!,"This was a well-written memoir, up to a point, by a well-known jerk. The author cruelly betrays the confidences of the teenager he hires to catch him. He thinks about noone but himself.Nevertheless, the book is very readable until his emotional breakdown in the closing chapters: after exhibiting a near-complete disregard for most of the human beings he encounters, he completely falls apart at the death of his dogs, dissolving into near hysteria.What a mess. What a jerk.Stick with A False Spring, which also shows Jordan up as jerk, but remains a classic nonetheless."
5,On The Field For The Waterbury Spirit,"I was on the field and helped warm up Pat Jordan in the bullpen before his appearance on the mound during his game with the Waterbury Spirit. His description of the locker room, stadium, and mentality of the players was accurate.I hope that he still enjoys his memory as an independent baseball player as much as many of us do. The book is a fun read, and the chapter of his time right before the game is hysterical!"
2,Hrm..,"Growing up, I played both Moon Patrol and Spy Hunter in the arcades, then on the Atari 2600 console and Atari 800XL computer. The Spy Hunter reminds me of the Atari 800XL version of Spy Hunter, slightly easier than the 'real thing' but still awkward to get your car moving fast enough to be effective, but slow enough to give you time to react to things coming down the road (typical Spy Hunter problem though). For a better Spy Hunter, and a faithful arcade adaptation, go to shockwave.com and play theirs. As far as Moon Patrol, the music is hard to hear, and the UFO's are hard to shoot and and dodge, but it is a faithful arcade adaptation. Unless you REALLY liked these two games in the past (to discover this about yourself, ask yourself ""Can I hum the Moon Patrol theme?""), I wouldn't suggest the purchase. I feel I paid $15 too much for this $20 cartridge.."
2,Disappointing,"Not a good version of Spy Hunter, as the maneuverablility is not good on this platform. Am awaiting a version of Super Spy Hunter somewhere. This is just not fun to play."
4,One of Loudon's Best!,"For me, Loudon's best work was on the trio of studio albums he did for Rounder: Fame and Wealth, I'm Alright and More Love Songs (the latter two co-produced by Richard Thompson). I'm Alright finds Loudon on the top of his game with several ""wit meets pathos"" classics, including One Man Guy (later covered - perhaps with double meaning - by his son Rufus) and the title cut. Cardboard Boxes is a great acoustic rocker about the woes of moving and Daddy Takes a Nap has a great last line. Loudon mostly avoids the sometimes too personal musings of his later work (starting, IMO, with the first post-Rounder album), but the most personal song here, Screaming Issue (about daughter Lucy Roche), manages to touch the heart without making you cringe. And a great band, too, featuring several of Thompson's collaborators and at least on Fairporter."
4,wonderful songwriting,"I have an ""Out of This World"" feeling sometimes. The emotional range of all the songs in this collection expands my mind and allows me to feel that ""Not John"" was a very human lesson: all you heroes best beware. ""Screaming Issue"" is incredibly sweet. Just saying that how ""I'm Alright"" sums up mind in music is so much like Martin Luther's justification by faith is readier now than we'll ever be."
2,Oh Loudon,"I am about to give up on him. He seems to be rehashing his old songs and compiling them into poorly produced albums, or his songwriting on new pieces does not break new ground. Loudon -- dig deep into that creative spot and give us something really new that knocks our socks off. An exception on this is the One Man Guy, that one is great."
1,Quick Course/Microsoft Publisher 2000 - Don't bet on it,"A word of warning to those who believe the title - the authors claim it is for the 2000 version of Publisher, but many of the screens and keystrokes they portray are of an earlier version. After struggling through several pages of the intro, they thoughtfully threw in a text box on page 10, to explain that the book is based on the '98 version of the program and that ""the appearance of your screen might not match ours..."" Terrific. If you are a veteran of Publisher, this might not be a problem, but if you bought this thing thinking it would lead you through the 2000 edition of the program, you are left to wander through it, and getting stuck on a page with no way to go back without losing what you already have done. If you are a rookie on learning this program, don't expect this book to be your guide. Take a class instead or keep looking for a better tutorial."
4,An excellent application of behavior dynamics to tech work.,"This book helps make sense of why some of the seemingly reasonless things related to technical projects happen. An excellent book to have on hand to refer to at the beginning of a project to help avoid disaster; or at least to let you know when to get out.Donzil E. Lowther, P"
4,Informative and interesting - Maybe not for a beginner,"I really enjoyed this book. Written in the 1950s, is has an interesting view of the 1920s through the lens of a post-war intellectual. Giving evenhanded accounts of Wilson, the Roosevelts, Smith, McAdoo, Coolidge, Hoover, and other major players of the period, the author manages to critically analyze the era leading up to the depression without condemning it in broad strokes.Leuchtenburg does a particularly good job of defending Hoover as a capable and intelligent man with little tolerance for playing politics and an incredibly poorly dealt hand dealt to him. He is also critical of the often beautified TR.The Perils of Prosperity is a worthy read for anyone interested in the social and political machinations of the early 20th century."
3,The Perils of Marginalizing,"Seller indicated some underlining and marginal notations. Actually, every page is spattered with both, to the extent that it is seriously distracting."
3,"Thomistic, but not exegetical","Guisler writes from the Thomistic model/classical model of theo proper. His work is really helpfull in this regard; however, if you are looking for biblical/exegetical theology look elswhhere. In tradition with Thomistic thinking, God is analysed through logical deductions begining with cosmological arguments, resulting in metaphysical perfections, resulting in proof-texting."
4,Material For teaching,"Are you looking to teach a class, school etc.. on the product of Faith in American history?If so this film is perfect.With 30 min sections discussing faith in history it can be very useful.If you are a strong critical thinker just a warning... there are a few interviewers who make their claims not based on historical fact as much as theory.Yet the primary source from 90% of the interviews were historical truths."
4,There are so many things we should be thankful for,I translated this book into Turkish and I assume it will go into print sometime around October 1998. It took me a month to translate it and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is one of those books that help you understand the mental picture of a person much better and gets you acquainted with a phenomenon like schizophrenia about which many of us know nothing. It is an autobiography written in utmost sincerity and precision. After reading this book you will understand how simplicity can be the most beautiful thing in the world.
1,Curious about this book!,"I am curious to read this book it sounds inspiring. It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy. I too am skeptical about the idea of dialysis to treat or overcome schizophrenia. I think it does a bit of a disservice to people with serious mental illness who have to take or often refuse medication with difficult side effects to advocate an experimental and risky ""cure"" with no significant treatment outcomes but it's a definite read."
4,A good overview of the Renaissance,"Written for the 9 to 12 year old, this 100 page book is a lovely overview to the major issues of the Renaissance. The title hints at whats to come -- rats (method of transmission for the Plague), bulls (the Martin Luther kind), and flying machines (Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance man). Making cameo appearances: the Medici, Machiavelli, the Borgias, Castiglione, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Michaelangelo, Raphael, Van Eyck, Shakespeare, Durer, Bruegel, Cervantes, Gutenberg, Henry VIII, St. Ignatius Loyola, and Galileo. Also discussed is the Reformation, although somewhat limited in scope. Beautiful color pictures. The only real complaint that I have is that the book is too brief, but an excellent start for youngsters discovering the Renaissance."
5,Great Book,"This book is great, it is full of colorful pictures and stories that make history not only exciting for students, but also teachers."
3,over priced,"I really expected a better quality it's sewing is really bad and it's made from very cheap material, but what compensated me is that my son didn't mind; he was just happy to carry a Harry Potter backpack."
5,It's about time.,"Finally, a thorough book on the use of Visual C++'s Debugger. This book will take you through the essentials of optimization, debugging inline assembly code, dealing with MFC, and goes on to discuss repairing errors in STL code. If you want to get the most out of the debugger in Visual C++, you must have this book!"
2,Should have been titled Debugging Windows code,"The title suggests that this is a c++ book. It is not. More than half the text is devoted to MFCs, DLLs, and other microsoft platform and tools specific issues. In fact, perhaps only 2-3 of the chapters can be said to be actually dealing with the c++ language. And the information provided there is pretty generic. ""debug your code, not stroustrup's"". Well, thank you. For users more advanced on MFCs and the like, it may be of use, but for students of C++, money is better spent elsewhere."
3,VC++ Debugger,"This book stays to much on the surface. - In the main part it describes how to use the VC++ Debugger (the menu, the buttons). It's ok for beginners."
2,great features...poor quality,"I bought this lamp because it had all the features I was looking for...HOWEVER...the quality is very flimsy and poorly constructed. For $166 I expected something more sturdy, but it is what it is.I have this in my nursery next to the glider. I love the dimmer lighting, the reading light, and the shelf. Although I am not too sure the shelf can handle much more than a glass of water. I have it standing on carpet and decided to use a wire wall mounting bracket to make sure the lamp does not tip over. If it was placed on a hard surface, maybe the leaning/swaying wouldn't be as bad.Next time I will read the reviews...as I am now noting that others have experienced the poor quality."
4,"Big-time Be Bop Fun, with Ray Bryant!","No surprise that Roach went on to cover some Charlie Parker, because this album has a very Charlie Parker feel.""Be Bop"" is such a good name for this sound. Ray Bryant contributes his typically fabulous back up to this collection of jazz veterans, and the result is a little party captured on disc.If you're looking specifically for Ray Bryant stuff, this may not satisfy, as the horns take center stage this time. Lots of fun, none-the-less."
3,Op Amp Book Review,"Mechanical engineer researching op amps for circuit applications: not enough sample circuits; too high and mighty, not for casual users."
4,Specialized but very good study on Outre-Mer,"The medieval European presence in Asia Minor as a result of the first couple of crusades meant the imposition of the feudal system on a culture that (generally) didn't even speak Indo-European languages. The consensus has been that this meant the Kingdom of Jerusalem and its various tenant counties by conquest experienced a ""pure"" feudalism, with an especially powerful nobility -- but Tibble argues that this is not the case, that the balance of power was much more evenly divided between the monarchy and the aristocracy. In making his case, he examines in some detail the family connections and land holdings of the conquerors. A basic background knowledge of Outre-Mer is helpful."
4,Great music with a glitch.,"As always Nana Mouskouri fantastic voice imbues these classic Spanish songs with passion. Unfortunately, one track does not play correctly."
3,Amazing singer but no new songs,"There is no doubt in my mind that Nana is is the most outstanding singer on earth and that her ability to sing in many languages is quite unique and unrivalled. The songs on this CD are all magnificent. The only problem is that they are all recycled from previous recordings, all of which had been recently released when Recuerdos 2 came out. This is just another compilation CD the record company came out with to make extra money. If you already have all the original CDs then this CD is a total waste of money. Buy all the original albums instead and listen to all of the songs on each one. You'll be glad you did."
3,Scooby doo,"Perfect for kids, a bit rough, not sure on the thread count. Overall kids loves it, and that is all that counts!Aloha"
5,...,... trust me shoppers this is a good game exept the boss at the end is a little too hard but hey what game doesn't have a hard ending boss exept that castlevania game for playstation but it is a good game for kids who like the movies. by the way the graphics are good....
1,What happend?,"After playing the pervious version (Mortal Kombat 3) I was quite impressed and would have expected the next (Mortal Kombat 4) to be even better. However the cold hard fact is that this is just not true. When I first got this game I opened it with trembling fingers and quickly slid in the game and went right for the power switch only to be stunned with disbelief. The graphics were horrendous, the sound was almost pointless, and there was no control to speak of once you started playing. The bottom line is this game isn't even worth thinking about. My suggestion to you if you must play Mortal Kombat right now is to get Mortal Kombat 3. But if I were you I'd wait till Mortal Kombat 5 comes out."
1,MK4,"Just give up, this game is so bad i dont how it got a seal of quality. Its MK3 remade. choppy terrible graphics, horrible sound, moves, and everything else. I can't even tell which character im choosing!! You can tell they put noo effort into this game at all. If you want a fighting game try street fighter alpha on Gbc, and stay far away from this!!!"
5,Choose your destiny. Buy this game!,"This game is really cool, a game that any gamer should have. Although you don't have many players to choose, this Mortal Kombat tournament will thrill you.Classic Mortal Kombat moves mixed with some new Mortal Kombat gameplay style... this game rocks!!!"
1,Komplete Mess,"This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4! The graphics are awful,the sound and music is ear aching,and the gameplay is beyond hideous.This plays just like MK3 did on the gameboy...like total krap! Actually,it may even be worse than MK3! Avoid this at all costs!"
4,Mortal Komabt 4,"I'm gonna start out with this, ""so much violence on GBC its absolutly crazy!"" I mean that with every fiber of my being. Whats that? you don't understand? let me explain...GRAPHICS- Strange as it is, the graphics aren't up to par with its more than successful big brother, MK3. The violence I mentioned earlier comes from the full motion video fatalities that MK4 has to offer. The videos are about 4 seconds long, and return to humble beginings with black and white picture.SOUND- Same old same old, bones cracking, people screaming, the usual. The game does have some pretty nifty voice acting on the part of the announcer.GAMEPLAY- Limited movement, and a rather quick frame rate, wierd blend, but it works. Fatalities are easy to pull off so don't let me hear ""I never could pull that one off.""In conclusion, its a great addition to anyone's GBC library, and if you don't have it, GET IT!!!!!"
4,"Could be said to be ""the final word"" on the subject","The only reason this book got 4 starts instead of 5 is the slight anti-American tone at times (for example, the US inquiries are treated as a almost a joke) and something in this much detail could not help but be tedious at points (the discussion of ""port"" and ""starboard"" lights comes to mind),but it is extremely well-done, leaves no point untouched, examines minutely any evidence in Lord's favor, and comes to the point of the matter- he saw what he knew ""might have been"" distress rockets and did nothing- and really, that is the end of it."
5,Nothing Else Comes Close,"No matter what your view is on this particular aspect of the Titanic tragedy, you cannot help but be impressed by this book. This is, without question, one of the best-researched Titanic books ever written. If you happen to come across this rare gem don't hesitate to pick it up, because it's likely that you won't see it anywhere else!"
5,An informative & enoyable book.,"I found ""The Ship that stood still"" to be a very informative & enjoyable book. It is written in such a fashion that it does not deluge the casual reader with incomprehensible nautical terms. It is a reasoned & dispassionate exploration of the Californian's role in the Titanic disaster. There has much partisan literature produced in the past relating to the conduct of Captain Lord. This book does not descend into partiality."
4,Decent,"It has great features, all the right jerseys and players.online is pretty fun. The season is pretty much the same as all fifa games. But on gameplay,it doesnt come close to beating winning eleven. If i was you i would just wait till early Febuary and buy winning eleven 9 for the psp. It will be much funner and better. And by the way the camara angles werent bad. 3in-a-half stars"
5,great for any sports fan,"Wow, good graphics, and great game. I'm a soccer fanatic so I bought this game thinking to have it just to keep my soccer rep. but instead this is the best game ever, you've got everything a soccer game should have plus you've got awsome multiplayer. This is a great game and you shoud buy t if you like sports"
2,It's just i'ight,"Interesting cast, nice whips, and some of the gadgets were hilarious, BUT Duane Martin as anything but a lady's man, or screw up I wasn't ready for all that! And JadaKiss acting OOH HELL NO! Sometimes you just have to say no. It's obviously a low budget film filled with African Americans so I say support your people! I mean it was what it was a movie!"
4,Mean dudes carrying on...,"A friend loaned me this film, and I thought it would be a bust. It's silly, borderline-stupid, and then...hey, what's going on? I knew the fun would start when Fox mention's her plutonium-laced tampon, not to mention a serum that makes guys horny at all costs. (That tampon saves the day...)A cross between Mission: Impossible, James Bond and Jackie Chan, once I knew it was a parody, I can't remember having more fun.When the big, black, behemoths get friendly with each other, it just becomes a laff riot till the end.Sure, it's no great film, but I just may buy this as a fun guilty pleasure. Parody films are usually more fun than the originals.."
2,And Another One,"Another low budget movie to put on the shelf.I could not believe the great cast that this movie had, except for Duane Martin. I was so shocked that these talented actors and actresses allowed themselves to be seen in this movie. They must have owed Duane Martin a favor, he wrote the film. I could not even believed that Will & Jada Smith financially backed the film and Vivica A. Fox should have never stooped this low....dayum.Duane Martin what trying so hard to be a thug in this movie, but it definitely did not work, not in the least. The story line was so corny.Jadakiss should stick to rapping, because acting is not one of his strong points.I was very happy to see one of my classmates from John Jay College in Manhattan, Phil Hayes in the movie, he had a short part but he did da dayum thang. I'm glad to see he is doing him.Back to the movie, instead of it going straight to DVD is should of went straight to the trash.Later!!!"
5,Good Movie And Music,this is a very good musical drama. this movie is awesome. I Recommend it for everyone
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:When it's at its best Dreamgirls is an aggessive and engaging musical, but too often it slides into slow scenes and uninteresting songs (We are a family/like a shining tree) while focusing on characters like Curtis (played by a thoroughly bored looking Jamie Foxx) that the audience doesn't care as much about; Dreamgirls is a mixed bag but I suggest you pass."
3,dreamgirls,"The story is ordinary in this category, not much surprise. But the songs are great. Very easy listening and the sound effect is good! Never imagine I like this kind of film so much."
4,Dreamgirls DVD a nice dream,I loved the movie Dreamgirls and am addicted to the soundtrack. I couldn't wait for the movie to be released on DVD. All in all I was pleased with DVD. I'm a special features fanatic. I enjoyed the deleted and extended songs portion. It was obvious that behind the scenes portions and interviews were filmed during the filming and Beyonce was the star. At times I felt the extra features were the Beyonce show. I would have enjoyed more on Jennifer Hudson. Still two thumbs up for this dreamgirl.
2,The editors should be shot,"The editors of this film should be shot. No shot lasts more than 3 seconds. On a big screen tv it's dizzing. It's too bad since the film on a whole is a pretty good film, and the music is pretty great. But the film is ruined by fast cutting and quick shots - was the editing team on speed???????? Why do they think this is the way to edit a musical? If you become aware of the editing while you're watching a film, then the editors have done a bad job. Hire editors who know how to edit a film, skip the Blu-ray and by the CD."
1,Not at all what I expected,"No disrespect to Ms. Jennifer Hudson, but this was the worst thing I have tried to watch in a long, long time. It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on. This would have been so much better as a movie and not a musical. It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it. I had to finally turn it off about 3/4 of the way through it. JMHO and no disrespect intended."
3,"Music is Too ""White""","I purchased the soundtrack before seeing the film. I was not impressed and have not listened to it again. I thought the music sounded like it was the product of someone that had no idea what the real Motown sound was all about. It is way over-orchestrated but I know this is Broadway - it's supposed to be.I thought that after seeing the film and the songs in thier proper context maybe I would like them a little better. Nope, music's still too ""White"", but I did really enjoy the actors. Eddie Murphy got robbed on the Oscar, Jennifer Hudson was good and probably deserved hers, but I can't really say because I did not see any of the other nominated performances. So...I give the film 4 stars and the music 2 stars.Lots of extras on disc 2 make this 2-disc set worth the extra money."
5,"win, win !","This is such a great movie ! Best Actress winner Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce makes a win, win movie ! Add to the cast Eddie Murphy and Jamie Fox.I usually am not a fan of Broadway musicals turned in to movies, but this works on all levels !"
4,One BIG voice,"During Jennifer Hudson's first song (I don't remember which song that was), I turned to my friend and whispered, ""This girl lost?"" I was, of course, referring to American Idol. For those who don't know this, in an interesting reversal of fortunes, Jennifer Hudson beat out former American Idol winner Fantasia for the role. And now, she's nominated for a Golden Globe, and has already snagged eleven awards (see imdb). Talk about life imitating art.Translating a Broadway smash to the screen is never easy, but this seemed seamless, and the other cast members, specifically Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx, lent the film extraordinary believability.I generally don't enjoy musicals, but listening to Jennifer Hudson sing was absolutely a revelation."
4,A movie I will watch several times,"They did a great job of evoking the era of Diana Ross and her contemporaries. So many scenes, set pieces, costumes, and songs in this movie rekindled vivid memories. Beyonce is gorgeous to look at, from the opening scenes where her character is still green, unpolished, cute and bubbly, to later where she's a mega-star. Jennifer Hudson sings with the power and beauty to move audiences to tears. Eddie Murphy is an unexpected scene stealer. I had no idea he had that in him. He's great in his on-stage performances as a singer, and equally great in his dramatic scenes. I loved this movie; it will probably be one I watch several times."
2,"It does have a story, sort of","Repetitious. I lasted one hour watching this before I left the room. My spouse was able to watch it to the end and enjoy the story underneath.I gave Moulin Rouge one star, partly because of the shrill grating voices. At least Dream Girls has more natural voices. And it was fun to see how different performers of the era were represented by these fictional characters. And there was at least one educational piece of historical information: Elvis was not the original singer for Hound Dog. It was Big Mama Thornton, but her version was suppressed by mainstream white radio."
2,A Talented Cast Held Back by a Poor Script,"The acting of Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx supplemented with the singing of Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce' - the makings of a great musical film, right? Unfortunately Dreamgirls does not deliver.The plot of Dreamgirls focuses on the struggle of a naive trio of talented young singers during the 1960's. Unfortunately the film focuses much of its attention on the root cause of all evil in the U.S. during this time period - white people. Seriously, the only time you see a caucasian or hear a reference to one during this film, it is to make the point that they racists or thieves who don't appreciate good music.In the end, I expected a lot more from this talented cast and therefore came away disappointed."
5,CAN'T WAIT!!!,i couldn't wait until i heard that Dreamgirls was going to be a movie... especially when i found out that my girl Jennifer Hudson was going to be starring in the movie... i have been a huge fan of hers since american idol. i have never watched the original Dreamgirls but i have watched sparkle and it was really similar to Dreamgirls.this movie was so good... eddie murphy was at his best since the first nutty professor movie. the songs were amazing. 'and i am telling you' is probably one of the better songs to come out in a while and its a remake...IM so glad that its coming on DVD in about a month cuz i am tired of watchin it on bootleg... LMMFAO!!!!5 out of 5 stars: brilliantly done
2,It was boring.,"There are some really nice things about the film- the cast, the wardrobe, the music. However, there wasn't much else. I ended up fast forwarding through most of it because I was so bored."
5,Dreamgirls,"This will become a classic, good story, great singing and star studded cast. What's not to love?"
3,Dream Girls DVD,"Received prompt delivery. Since the movie was so highly rated and had good reviews, I was a little disappointed, as it just wasn't to my taste.Excellent acting, well done -- just not something I'd want to watch again."
3,well-acted but overlong,"I suspect one's reaction to this movie depends a lot on how one responds to the music. I could admire the performances, especially Hudson's, and some of the numbers were really rousing. Others were not. I must admit I had to fast-forward through more than one semi-operatic number.This story seems to mirror the history of Diana Ross and the Supremes. Not being an expert, I have no idea how much of it is factual and how much merely semi-factual. The contrived ""happy ending"" was certainly the latter.So, the pluses: some of the musical numbers, Hudson's performance, also Eddie Murphy who puts in a tremendous performance, his best for years.The minuses: too long, too many tuneless tunes, cliched acting, especially by Foxx who is peculiarly wooden. Beyonce is incredibly beautiful but her talent is outshone by Hudson's.Definitely worth renting but it's not a true classic."
4,Dreamgirls is a dream,Well acted storyline with a great performance from first timer Jennifer Hudson. When you're in the mood for a musical this picture will not disappoint. Eddie Murphy is very versitile and it was good to see him act in a serious role. Kudos!
3,NOT ENOUGH PLOT,"Although this is obviously a musical, there was a bit TOO MUCH singing and not enough emphasis on the plot. Jennifer Hudson was fantastic, and definitely deserved her Oscar, but the movie falls flat in a lot of places. Still, I'm glad I watched it, if only to see Jennifer Hudson's amazing performance!"
3,"I wanted to really love it, but...","Was really excited for Dreamgirls to come out. I haven't seen the play, but I am happy that Hollywood is doing more film musicals. I don't want to give too much away, but the story really becomes flowery at the end. At the start it brings in heavy subjects like: drugs, pregnancy, weight problems, who is the center of the spotlight, love tiffs, and more. I KNOW it's a musical, but this is obviously a biography of the Supremes. And I am pretty sure the outcome that happened in the movie, didn't happen in real life. It has a great begining and build, but the conclusion is just not what I thought it was going to be.I'm not going to say don't see it because the music is great, Jennifer Hudson deserved all her awards. During the finish of her big number the theatre greatly applauded for her. That never happens at movies! See it for that. But the script adaptation did not really sell it for me."
4,"The more you see it, the better it gets.",Jennifer Hudson is sensational. Eddie Murphy's musical performances are great. Beyonce is beautiful. Jamie Foxx is ruthless and Danny Glover delivers.
3,Dreamgirls,"Saw a preview last night. Great production values, show-stopping performance by Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy terrific. Jamie Foxx one dimensional. Beyonce good, Anika likewise. A little long at 125min.Fun for those of us who lived through the '60s and '70s. Music had me movin' in my seat and who-whoing."
1,"very forgetable, this ain't Chicago","see the 2 star ""J. R. South"" 12/26 review, who seems to be the only reviewer who saw the same movie I saw,the specifics of the critique are right on point - no need for me to repeat - don't know what these other reviewers saw, this is just a flat out badly conceived and produced movie, started looking at my watch after 45 minutes, if you pass this one by you will have missed nothing, if you go - then make sure to come back and write a ridiculous rave review and don't forget to mention ""Oscars"""
3,Average film - fantastic music,Technical a good bluray movie - but I think it was an average movie. Perhaps I'm not just into musicals...
2,Too Much Singing !,Knowing it was a musical I was prepared for a fair portion of singing but had not expected a movie hardly with any spoken lines! There must have been about 1 full hour of song and to make matters worse most of the material ranged from forgettable to outright unmelodious or awkward. The cast certainly proved they could sing but with hardly a spoken line and without a decent storyline it made for very long and dull viewing.
5,Love this movie!,Such an excellent movie. Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Hudson do amazing in this. I am going to watch it over and over again. It's a great watch with the hubby.
4,Long over due to watch,It has been out for awhile and never got a chance to rent. Great cast and such a good story. Lots of talent in this one!
5,It's better than the theatrical release!!!,"Now let me explain. It is not the Broadway play. It couldn't be. That was a masterpiece. There was after all Jennifer Holiday. I saw the movie twice. The first time I thought it didn't really hang together. The second time I started to appreciate Bill Condon's concept and thorouhgly enjoyed it. Now here's the DVD with extended and deleted scene intact.Well, Mr. Condon, if some of these scenes were included, Dreamgirls would have become one of Hollywood's best musicals. It's almost there and better than Chicago. The Steppin to the Bad Side is as good as anything in West Side Story."
1,Boring movie,"God, this movie was one of the worst I've seen in a while. I wasn't expecting it since it got like, Golden Globes and stuff. But, it was boring and the music was bland."
2,Just bad,"As the story of the Supremes, I wonder why they didn't just make a bio-pic with the real music? As it stands, this is unsatisfying, and the original score is a screechfest that's not even close to Motown in style. This reminds of the awful Bette Midler 70s pic, ""The Rose,"" another attempt to tell a star's story without actually naming the star, in that case Janis Joplin. Eddie Murphy, as the Marvin Gayish singer, is sort of impressive here, but Jamie Foxx is expressionless as the Berry Gordy-like character. The dreamgirls themselves are forgettable. Watch it if you like ear-numbing screeching."
3,at least they didnt turn dickie attenborough loose on this one,"this was supposed to be the movie that made people go see movie musicals again. guess what? it didnt. its not a bad movie. its even sorta a good movie. but its flat. it never made me want to get up & applaud, and i felt manipulated when i did enjoy myself. yes, jennifer hudson IS wonderful, but ""i am telling you i am not going"" has become as much a cliche as any rodgers & hammerstein song, without being half as good; beyonce demonstrates the acting range of diana ross, and i am telling you that is not a compliment; and the unjustly hyped eddie murphy gives a performance to rival tony bennett as hymie kelly in ""the oscar"". ""dreamgirls"" on stage was the triumph of director michael beennett, and not its writing team; while this is not the insult to bennetts memory that ""a chorus line"" is, it sure doesnt make THIS lover of both broadway & hollywood musicals want to tap his troubles away."
2,Dream Girls,"This movie was Ok. I didn't really care for it! It's not as great as the people say it was. I wish the ended was different. The singing was good! I think there was too much singing in the film, Each time a problem came up they would sing about it! I like it in a sence that it talks about how black weren't treated equal in the music business or any where else. I like how it showed a white guy making a hit from a black guys song! That's what they did back then! ""You Know!"" I think if you like musical and like the pros and cons of the white's and blacks then this film is for you.I hope you take this film into consideration.~Enjoy the movie~"
5,The best movie in years!!!!!,"With a star-studded cast such as Jamie Foxx, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy you cant go wrong there. This movie is such a great inspirational story. There is amazing and unforgivable music in this movie, such as ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going To"", and I love ""One Night Only (Disco)"" song by Beyonce. You'll love this movie, it's just.....amazing~!"
1,rubbish,"well what can i say about this film, not much,some of the songs are good,and the singing is ok. the whole story is rubbish the film is over long and becomes very silly and boring, so all in all i dont think it was any good and is a complete wast of time and money......i have loved diana ross for years and this film is just something made up by some bloody fool."
1,Just another Rags to Riches Story,"I was really looking forward to watching the movie. As the story unfolded, I kept thinking it was going to get better. Alas, I was so bored that I turned it off after an hour. If you like the actors or are big into musicals, then maybe this won't be your opinion. Yes, they are certainly a talented group of actors/actresses with wonderful vocal cords, it just seemed like a dozen other 'somebody crawled out of anonymity to fame story'. I felt the dialogue dragged as if someone just retold an old story but freshened the words and added the requisite characters. I have already told others not to waste their money but revisit a classic such as ""Ray""."
1,BAD COPY...WONT PLAY AT ALL,Gave this as a Christmas gift...just found out the person is not able to watch the DVD bc it is defective....
2,Good music but lame racial politics,"I did like the music - although nothing about this film compares to Chicago in terms of score, acting, depth or cinematography. The racial agenda was pretty blatant. I guess it should be expected. It must be a standard requirement in Black films - all White and Asian are either thieves, awkward & dull idiots, or mean victimizers. It's a cultural motif that no adult (at least any thinking adult) buys."
1,Two Hours of Screaming!,"This movie is terrible. I'm not surprised it made its way so fast to DVD - 2 hours of screaming - I don't call it singing. None of the songs had a melody, does not compare to Diana Ross and the Supremes, if this is what this story was supposed to be about. I turned it off 1 1/4 hour into the DVD - couldn't care less what happened to the characters. It seems people either hated or loved this one - I couldn't stand it. So far the worse movie I watched in 2007."
3,Eh...it was ok...,"I was rather disappointed upon watching this movie.I merely gave it 3 stars for the singing, which was wonderful! Beyonce and Jennifer were spectacular. However, I don't think that the movie lived up to all of the hype that was made over it. Through the movie I tried to get into it, but I just never could... the movie just seemed to be very boring."
3,Good but not great,"I though this movie was mostly entertaining. I thought the music was exceptional. I did think some of the songs went on for way too long, like the one where Jennifer Hudson's character was being removed from the band.I thought this movie was probably pretty close to what it was like for an African American to get introduced into the music industry. I also thought the acting was suberb.I lower the rating by one because of the unneccesary placement of the F word from Beyonce's character (I can't stand movies that put it in there to make sure they get a PG13 rating) and another point because it was probably about 30 minutes too long and some of the characters weren't developed as much as they should, like Eddie Murphy's and the Dreamgirl that he was sleeping with.Overally good but not great."
4,"Good, (not great) movie","I was waiting with baited breath to see this movie, but left the theater unquenched....what happened????...Eddie Murphy's role was good from what you saw of him, his part could have been expanded (..and I'm not even a fan!) What-ever happened to Leon, who starred in The Temptations???...just askin;.Thought he would have been better suited for the part...but I guess Murphy was a bigger draw.Beyonce's singing was good...as always,But she IS over exposed! but the REAL show stopper was Jennifer...WOW! what vibes.Jammie Fox was not strong enough and did nothing for his role.Perhaps Denzel could have flipped this movie into a powerhouse..... probably wanted too much money. I could see Morgan Freeman in the part of Danny Glover...Much more humility and prescence!...The songs were great, and the costumes were just right for that era. we should be thanking Berry Gordy and Diana Ross for this privalege..... Sandee"
2,"Wonderful singing, but movie overall is lacking","Despite the hype that Dreamgirls received, both critically and at the Box Office, I still believe there's something lacking here. Without a doubt, the singing is incredible, and Jennifer Hudson is truly a wonderful singer and up-and-coming actress. What was overlooked was Anika Noni Rose's amazing performance as the third Dreamette. However, the plot itself does not develop fully until very late in the movie. The first hour is almost unbearable, in my opinion, as there is little emphasis on a central occurrence, rather the director employs montages to move the movie along.As another reviewer has noted, this movie does not hold up to Rent or Chicago. If you truly want to see it because of the movie itself, then see it. But if you're going off Hollywood's hype alone (as I did), I wouldn't recommend the movie. You really have to enjoy the original Dreamgirls Broadway concept to enjoy the movie."
5,Dream Girls dvd,Great movie Loved it in theater. Had to own it as soon as it came out. Great cast and wonderful breakthrough performance by Jennifer Hudson a true American Idol!
4,Best Musical since Chicago,"I LOVE this movie! I saw it 4 times in the theatre. The special features could have been better, but they do show Beyonce & Anika Noni Rose's screen tests. I wish they showed the screen test for Jennifer Hudson and more behind the scenes stuff."
3,Diana Ross was right,"I agree with Diana Ross how they change the movie enough so they don't have to pay her. I could see watching the movie that it definetly referred to The Supremes, like when the record covers came across the screen with the same layouts, and how it went from the Dreametts to the Dreams (think Primettes to Supremes). Also little ""Michael Jackson"" waiting outside the door for Deena ""Diana"" etc. I think the music sucked."
3,I GOT SINGING BLUES!,"ME AND MY DATE JUST WENT TODAY TO SEE THIS STAR STUDDED MOVIE! AND TO ALL OF MY ""MALE SPECIES"" THIS MOVIE IS REALLY NOT FOR US! JENIFFER HUDSON SONG HER HEART OUT WHICH IS VERY TRUE, BUT IT STILL WASN'T APPEALING TO ME! WITH ALL OF THE FEMALES IN THE THEATER CLAPPING (INCLUDING MY GIRLFRIEND) WHEN SHE SONG ""IM NOT GOING"" WAS A LITTLE NERVE WRECKING! BUT DON'T FEEL SO LEFT OUT MY FELLOW GUY SPECIES,EDDIE MURPHY WILL HAVE YOU CRACKING UP IN THIS! EVERYONE ELSE'S CHARACTERS WAS DULL TO ME EXCEPT JENNIFFER AND EDDIE! IT HAD SORT OF A GREASE FEELING WITH ALL OF THE JUMPING OUT OF NO WHERE SINGING! BUT, IN ALL THE MOVIE WAS A O.K MOVIE!"
4,I expected more,"I liked the movie, but for some reason I was expecting more. Lots of acting talent and the music was good."
3,"Worth renting, but not buying.","I enjoyed this movie because it is based loosely on the story of one of my favorite Motown groups, the Supremes. But the downside is that there's not much bonus material (at least not on this edition). The #1 thing I look for on DVDs is commentary by directors, producers &/or actors; I found none here. So I'm glad I saved money & storage space by renting instead of buying."
5,Dreamgirls,An awesome movie. I watched it several times. A must have movie. It really is a Showstopper. Received DVD fast and in great condition.
4,Great Acting...Great Music...Great Production,"I was never into musicals, but this one kept me tuned in. I found myself so interested in the movie, that I forgot it was a musical. I would have given this movie 5 stars, but I honestly think Beyonce' is beautiful & talented, but simply not a great actor."
5,Great Movie ..... .... ... ........ ..... ... .... ...... ........ ..... ....... ...... ......... ....... ......... ...... .....,Great Movie ..... .... ... ........ ..... ... .... ...... ........ ..... ....... ...... ......... ....... ......... ...... ...... ........
1,What's it all about?,"I had high hopes for this movie, but was disappointed in finding a wandering minstrel. Who was the hero? What was the story? Where was it going, and did it ever arrive? I was so bored I fast-forwarded through many of the musical numbers, and would have fast-forwarded through the rest, but I kept hoping I'd figure it out. I never did. Of course, it is possible that I finally got so bored that I fast-forwarded to the end and totally missed the point, but I don't think so. For a film that had so much potential to be really good, this was a bummer. In my opinion. And this has nothing to do with race. I love a movie where ordinary or extraordinary blacks overcome white-supremacist obstacles and rise to heights not formerly expected of them. But this film left me feeling cheated. Sorry. I really, really wanted to be in the cheering squad, and I found myself hissing instead. What went wrong?"
1,Not my dreamgirls,"This movie drifts into absurdity. The scenes when it tries to slip into operatic mode are not convincing and poorly produced. From there it rapidly declines into meaningless drivel and unlike any opera I have seen, and that is many, I feel that it should make up it's mind about what it wants to be. I wish for something more than a recital of rock songs trying to blend into a plot. The plot is based on the Supreme's who were a top national act who sang some of the greatest songs of the sixties. They should sue the makers of this picture for trivializing their image. This quickly becomes the first black soap opera I have seen. Looking at the prices for this on this site pretty much confirm my thoughts. Not many movies have a price of $4.99 for new copies of them."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"This movie gets one star because for all its hype and awards this movie was boring. The story was not all that interesting, the music was even less interesting. I don't what type of singing it is that Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson sing, but it has no melody and follows no beat, I would call commercial gospel. Nevertheless, it's a real turnoff and does not do any justice to the great music produced by Motown. Beyonce is just horrible and a fake. Can she ever make you believe she is playing anyone else but herself? Yeah, compared to her, Jennifer Hudson does seem like an academy award actress. Hudson has potential but isn't quite there yet. The accolades and awards where a little premature. I am not sure what criteria was applied to this movie to make everyone think it was so good, but it's not. Save your money and buy the Supremes Greatest Hits."
1,useless,"Unless you intend to connect this piece of junk to a cable line, it won't work because TV stations no longer available on the ""airwaves"". I forgot about that and thought the antena would pull in stations. But even if airwaves still around, the tuning knob broke off first time I turned it. What do you expect for the money?? It falls apart just looking at it."
1,Horrible,"Hi, i am writing this review in Guatemala but i live in california. I bought this thing for my nice here in guatemala and it did not work"
1,Totally blah,This was a very uninteresting waste of time. Thank goodness C. S. Forrester wrote other novels; I would never have bought any of his novels if I had read this thing first.
4,Entertaining,"Although it is tempting to think that The Free Spirits (the trio featured on this CD), due to the similarity of the instrumentation (guitarist John McLaughlin, organist Joey DeFrancesco and drummer Dennis Chambers), would be an updating of Tony Williams's groundbreaking fusion group Lifetime, the reality is somewhat different. McLaughlin may get top billing but this music sounds very much like a Joey DeFrancesco-led Jimmy Smith revival date with most of the selections being blues-based. There are some introspective moments for the guitarist (who plays strictly electric here) but DeFrancesco dominates the ensembles and takes the lion's share of the solo space. The music is enjoyable enough although none of the compositions (all but Miles Davis's ""No Blues"" are by McLaughlin) are all that memorable."
1,Sorry to all,All of you are right. This book has nothing to do with the test. Do not waste your money folks if your are planning to buy this book. Please!
1,DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS FOR THE TEST,"I'd call this as the EXAM SCAM series rather than EXAM CRAM. The real exam is much harder than the practice questions covered by the book. Plus, there are an awful number of glaring mistakes in this book that someone who knows FP well will begin to unlearn some of the stuff. So, beware. I found this book totally useless. Microsoft online help is probably the best cost-free solution to prepare for the exam. I found it the hard way. Watch out for the 'simulation' traps in the exam. Also, there are a number of questions on user setup, server configuration, etc. that are not covered at all in this book. Do not even read about FP Editor. There are hardly any questions."
5,Quick Read Helps the Experienced Passed,The whiners on here who bemoan the culture of the shortcut should shut up and move on. (One know-it-all above referred to the MCSE not having any value anymore... what does the FrontPage exam have to do with the MCSE anyway??)Get a life. This book is an excellent prep for the person already familiar with FrontPage or web authoring and who are looking to ensure they have covered all of the test objectives that will be covered on the exam. Get this book if you fall into this camp and want to pass the exam.
2,Book was nothing like the test. The test was much harder,"I read and studied the exam cram Frontpage98 book and memorized it front and back. Then I took the test. I failed. You need a score of 702 and I got a 680. I was close, very close but not quite. Many of the practice questions were not on the test and the test was heavy on server types, fire walls and proxy's, and it just had alot on it that the book didn't cover. It had alot of database access questions via Frontpage.I was dissapointed with the book. It had good content and I learned things from it - but it wasn't anything like the test. I will retry the test again in a couple weeks.I would appreciate anyone writing to me who took the test also. I would like to share notes on it. And also, how about folks that failed the test using the exam cram book."
4,Good book - helped me pass the test,"I am a long-time FP user, but I learned a thing or two reading this book. I read it carefully, answering all the practice questions, then went right to the test and passed! I have to say the book did its job. The test was non-adaptive, but it a MANY simulations that the book could not prepare you for."
2,Not a good review book,"The cram sheet is great in this book, however, the book itself is too basic, and makes no mention of the topics which you need an understanding of to do the simulations.I really find it hard to believe that the author/authors even wrote the exam."
3,An Adequate Guide,"Like I said, this book is adequate...It is not great, it is not outstanding...It is simply adequate, but it is the only book that you can buy that is ""officially"" for this test. I read this book and the Official Microsoft Frontpage 98 book and passed the test...So, I would recommend at least one book in addition to this one."
3,I like the book. I think it's helping me study.,The book so far seems to be doing a good job pointing out the areas where I need to study more. I have not taken my Frontpage98 exam yet. I'm concerned that the other reviews indicate that the actual test was much harder than the cram exam. I would have liked to know whether or not these people passed their exam. I will write back in with a comment to indicate what I thought about the book in realtionship to the cram exam book.
5,Great supplemental study guide,"This book was a good review for the FrontPage exam #70-055, and I passed with decent marks. I would recommend going through all the options and configurations of creating a web site with another book such as FrontPage 98 Unleashed. You must know every possible option, menu item, property, etc. in FP98."
4,The Goose Is Loose - A Fun Read,"""Goose Is Loose"" is a fun read. I found some of the pranks Gossage tells us about to be a riot, such as Sparky Lyle and the birthday cake. This book is not an in depth biography like Al Stump's ""Cobb"" or Robert Creamer's ""Babe"" (I highly recommend both for baseball and histroy buffs), but rather a light in-the-locker room, on-the-field, in-the-pub insight on baseball in the '70s and '80s from Goose's point of view. It has a poignant side as well. For example, Goose describes the sense of loss after Thurman Munson's death. And I think the Goose gives us a fair critique of some his contemporaries. If you're a baseball fan you'll probably enjoy this book."
3,GOOOOOOSE!,"Reading Goose Gossage's autobiography brought back happy memories of my teenaged Yankee-worshipping self, who knew that when #54 stepped onto the mound, good things were about to happen. Gossage's tales about his 22 years in baseball are sometimes ribald and often laugh-out-loud funny. However, longtime Yankee fans will be heavily reminded of Gossage's predecessor Sparky Lyle's brilliant and hysterically funny autobiography ""The Bronx Zoo""--the writing style is extremely similar. But what the heck--Gossage doesn't have to be John Updike. He just rears back and throws, and the result is a very pleasant read. See you in Cooperstown, Goose!"
4,Entertaining,"In his amazingly rich memoir, Gossage reveals he not only has a name every baseball fan knows, but he is also one of the best, and funniest, writers in sports."
3,Liked the Goose better before I read the book,"First off, I was a Sparky Lyle fan growing up in New York, so I was never much of a Goose fan. But as a die-hard Yankee fan, I felt compelled to read the book as I knew little about Gossage other than the fact that he was a hard-throwing power relief pitcher that had a good tenure in New York and whined for years about not being voted into Cooperstown...until he was finally voted in last year. After reading the book, I now also know he liked to hunt, liked to drink hard and party hard, and couldn't wait to get out of New York when his contract was up. The book is filled with some humorous anecdotes, but mainly about grown men horsing around after getting plastered and getting into fights. When you've heard one drinking story...well, it gets repetitive. I'm not a bircher, but Goose's use of worn and not so funny metaphors and profanity just lowered him in my book. Still, it was an enjoyable read for the insights of what went on during Goose's career."
2,First greek zombie flick ever...,"Evil is the first ever greek horror film which deals with...zombies and because i'm a zombie fan and also a greek u can imagine my happiness when i heard about this movie so i went straight and watched it in a greek theater with many expectations but unfortunately although it was a nice try it had nothing to do with the superb romero series and it suffered with the disease that all greek productions are suffering. The lack of experienced actors but that's another topic.Anyways, if u are a zombie fan check this out BUT i warn you u will be tired as time passes by.There are some good scenes like the last one with the soccer field but that won't save the movie.A Cult movie because it's the first ever greek zombie flick but it will never be a classic one."
2,Horrible Picture quality GREAT b-movie,Horrible I mean horrible picture quality. Also its all subtitled. I swear I rented this movie at Hollywood video when it first came out and it was dubbed english and fit fullscreen and widescreen not just a little square on the tv and no matter how u changed format it wouldn't enlarge it. grrr.... Funny and gory good time movie though. If you are okay with horrible film transfer to dvd quality go for it.. If not try and find a different version/copy..
2,Not my dream,"I bought this hoping it would be mellow and non-intrusive like the Karma Moffett cd I bought. Nope. This is what I think about when visualize cheesy new age music. Not terrible, just not my thing."
5,Shamanic Dream,Great CD. I truly enjoy listening to this music. The sounds are very relaxing. It makes my spirit soar.
5,Great Meditation Music,"I've found ""Shamanic Dream"" to be a great meditation CD. The didgeradoo & drum beat, mixed with the various sounds of nature, are extremely beautiful & relaxing. I like it so much that instead of just using it for meditation I now play it on the CD player within my computer often - a great way to relax while reading emails (smile).Another asset to this CD is the liner notes which speak about the healing effects of nature sounds & mantras - it's really quite interesting.Overall, I would highly recommend ""Shamanic Dream"" to anyone looking for good meditation/relaxation music. This is truly an awesome CD!"
4,Good Meditation & Relaxation music,"This is a great mediation CD; the first track is a drum rhythm played with the flute in the foreground, and a choir that sings ""So Be It"" as a mantra with some synthesized harmonics. The second track is a chakra meditation. The chakra meditation is a series of seven different sonic textures, with a bell that sounds in between each chakra transition. This really works for me because I dislike guided chakra meditations generally.I must confess that I sometimes (though not usually) find the fairly complex drum rhythm on the first track a bit too distracting for meditation, so it is not always a ""super calming"" experience for me. (thus 4 star), yet the chakra meditation on track 2 is great and I do it almost every day."
4,Wonderful...one minor complaint,There are ringing bell sounds either 2x or 3x within the later part of the cd that I think are out of place for the overall feeling. Every time I hear them I think of the children's books with audio tapes that ring a bell to instruct the child to turn the page. I'm disappointed none of the reviews (that I read) mentioned this and the samples don't contain them...otherwise its a wonderful cd.
4,new favorite,"This cd is my personal new favorite for my yoga practice and my students are enjoying it too.Each time I've played it for my class, the student's comments are quite positive, and they speak about completing class in a dream state.... Just lovely. Namaste...."
5,Very relaxing,"If you are a bodyworker, a yoga instructor, or just someone who likes to use sound to induce relaxation, then you will want this CD in your library."
5,Absolutely THE BEST relaxation music.,"This is absolutely THE BEST relaxation music. I listen to it all the time. One of my friends has schizoaffective disorder which causes him to often be angry, agitated, and depressed for no apparent reason. This CD has been EXTREMELY helpful to him and improved his quality of life a lot. The ""sound therapy"" theory of this music seems to actually work. It causes me to relax immediately and often helps me sleep when I'm having trouble getting to sleep."
5,Shamanic Dream Is Great,Wonderful and relaxing. The drum beats are like heart beats. Very soothing. Anything this group does seems to be really special.
4,Warning!,Look for the small print! Febraury 1964 is the date advertised but actual Guide is November 1964 edition which is decent.
4,Another great Chandler novel,"If you're a fan of Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe, you'll like this one. It twists and turns, often in ways that are bewildering at the time. Marlowe is cool and hard, but kind and caring. Many of the characters are under-developed, but Marlowe holds it all together. It's a very enjoyable read."
2,Nice retrospective... but not too informative,"Author rambles on about various old designs and the philosophies of the designers/builders, interspersing a few fuzzy B&W pictures and snippets of hull profiles. Might be interesting to the history buff, but if you want clear, relevant information on how to build a wooden boat... this book isn't for you. There are many others to choose from - I'd recommend Buehler's Backyard Boat Building and Gerr's Strength of Boats as two helpful books I've read so far."
4,New Plywood Boats,"Great book, with provisions... For someone with some previous knowledge about boat building, design and terminology this can be a very enjoyable and inspiring book. The boats covered in this book cover a broad range of types, for paddle, oar, sail and power. The information on them however ranges from brief descriptions with hand drawn scetches to fairly complete plans with offsets suitable for someone with previous knowledge of boatbuilding to be able to build from. One would not expect all of the boats to be fully described in plans because some of the boats are not the authors own designs but are included to illustrate the authors experience or modifications of the design. The book was well worth the modest price for me for the one design alone, the 9 foot ""Dandy Dingy"" which is one of the ones with adequate plans. This boat looks to be fairly easy to build and cute as could be."
2,Not For Those Who Wish To Build Boats,"The book is filled with stories about boats, not about boat building techniques or anything really of use to someone who is interested in building plywood boats, buyer beware! This title is misleading."
4,Finally a book about the new version!,"I've been using GIMP 1.1.9 through 1.1.15 for a long time, and all the books I found dealt with GIMP 1.0.4, which is a couple years old and has fewer features and a different interface. I was really glad to see a book that will be current with version 1.2 when it finally comes out. This one has a great mix of introductory material and more advanced tips. It doesn't try to cover every esoteric feature that no one ever uses. If you want a comprehensive but confusing guide, the Gimp User Manual does that. But if you just want to learn how to use GIMP to get good graphics, this book does the job."
2,"Good intro. to GIMP, but severely outdated","This is a very good guide to the basics of GIMP. However, it is important to note that this book is severely outdated. GIMP, being part of the GNU, is constantly changing, and many times I found myself struggling to find a button or executable action that was either moved, replaced, or removed in newer versions of the GIMP.David Bush's style is also quite wordy and may be difficult to follow for many readers. In short, if you are interested in learning the GIMP, I would suggest getting another book unless you are planning to struggle with this book.GIMP is a great program and I use it instead of Adobe becuase, well, it's free! I highly recommend anyone dissatisfied with Adobe's performance to get a good book along with the GIMP. You will not be disappointed with the GIMP. However, please look for another book becuase this book will not help you unless you are running a very old version of the GIMP."
5,So fun!,"Love it! I love its natural materials, and I love that my son will be able to use it different ways as he gets older.We got it for him 5 months ago for his 1st birthday. It came together fairly easily. Right now he just runs in there and ""hides"" every once in a while, but I anticipate that it'll be a part of creative play, plus just some personal space for him, as he gets older.We haven't done any painting yet - I figure that'll be a project in a few years."
3,its very average,i orderd this looking for elemental heros (thinking it was jadens deck) but it came with 5 avian burstinitrix clayman sparkman it came with other useful monsters and spells and traps it came very fast overall very average
5,I Baught this for a present to my Tanta,"She didn't have a watch at the time and didnt want to show she had one. So when she recieved it, she loved it and attached it to her shoulder bag. It looked cool. The watch itself is very different and has a great appeal to look at! As a matter of fact, It makes you want to look at it!"
5,Even more luxurious than it seems,"The views available here do not do this product justice (see eLuxury's site for much better views). The detailing of this item is completly hidden, from it's cute lamb logo face (yes, that's the animal used by Gwen as a trademark, not the brand), to the Old English lettered face, (magenta!)jeweled knob, and heart detailing on the inner ""locket,"" this is an item worthy of its price tag-- the best I found after scouring the net (its suggested retail is $295). The watch is also versatile: placing the clasp elsewhere on the brushed finished chain really changes its look, making it even classier). A true luxe item. Love angel music, baby!"
2,Nope - just not up to par with the rest of the genre,"I love all things Grisham, Greg Iles, Stephen King, Philip Margolin and (my new fave) Karin Slaughter. This was my first try at Rosenberg. The story line was interesting enough to keep me going, but halfway through the book I gave up, which I don't often do. There were many discrepancies that annoyed me. I'd have to turn back pages, thinking ""Didn't she already say.... yes, so what is she talking about here?"" The writing didn't grab me either - kinda flat. I hate to sound like a snot, but this seemed to me a ""dumbed-down"" version of a suspense novel. I finally decided, ""Give it up!"" There are too many books on my to-be-read list to continue with this. Sorry."
1,lack of research,"I listened to the whole unabrigdged book to try to understand why this book would get published. I belive it is the worst book of its genre that I have listened to on CD or read.There are several femal author's to choose from. Don't choose Ms. Rosenberg.Sullivan's Law (Rosenberg, Nancy Taylor)"
4,Great for anyone who doesn't get enough veggies,"Miracle Greens is a tolerable tasting formula, & is a great addition to a diet that is lacking in green vegetables, It also contains Spirulina & a great fiber complex which helps digestion. I drink one glass every morning & I do feel a little bit more energy through out the day!"
4,"Great Working, Not tasting....","I have been drinking this product for over a year on and off. I really enjoy the benefits to drinking it. The time i haven't been drinking it is just the times when i run out and don't get more for a while. The taste is awful, probably one of the worst things i have ever had to drink. There is no sweetness in this product, although, I have gotten used to slamming it down. This is an awesome product for those of us who do not eat enough veggies. It taste AWFUL, but works AWESOME!! I have no intentions of stopping the use of this product due to the flavor and I would recommend it to anyone!"
4,mixing miracle greens/reds,"How to best mix Miracle Green/Red? A blender?When I use a whisk or a spoon ( the instructionssay : mix) it is lumpy, the powder does not dissolve.What am I doing wrong? I wish the manufacturer hadgiven more detailed instructions."
2,Ok.,"I tried the ORAC Energy Greens (another brand) in the plastic container and in the plastic little on the go packets - when I take the on the go packets, I feel great. When I take from the plastic container, I don't feel anything? The same with this Micro Greens mix -- I don't seem to notice a difference in my energy or mental acuity or feelings ? Also the taste is worse than ORAC Energy greens bc it's kind of sweet and minty rather than just being a bland greens taste which is much more palatable. So far, I'm compelled to go back to the ORAC greens packets. I've heard Ormus Greens by Sun Warrior are very good too?"
2,Wrong Photo...,"The photo shows Miracle greens so I used that as a reference hoping that's what I would get.. But as it is written, I received Micro greens instead. Of course this will do, but I much prefer the flavor of Miracle greens over Micro."
3,lets see,"The very first rule of surfing the internet is ""never believe anything you see on the internet."" having said this,even though the reviews of this product seem too good to be true with the exception of three (two which criticized the product and one which was indifferent, i still went on purchasing the product. common, lets be logical, it will be awkward for me to buy something that has low rating, however i'll update you guys if this is a hoax.."
1,disappointed,"I received this great product in a timely manner except when I opended it, the inner seal was broken, some of the product had spilled out and I could not trust its freshness. I got a label for return from the sender but I never got credit for the product yet.Can you help."
3,Not much of a veggie eater.,"I like to mix it with half apple juice/ half water as recommended. I have no way to tell of its effectiveness. However, I like the taste of the product. I like the principle of the product. I am sloppy about regularly eating enough fruits and veggies. So I will wait and see but feel better about using this product than not."
2,"Stimulant-free, I don't think so...","While I think this is a high quality product and tastes great, it's too strong for me and I experienced reactions to it. For one, my hands and feet felt really cold the days I took it and looked extremely pale. I suspect it is from the horsetail which SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED by those with circulatory problems such as Raynaud's or heart issues. This product is labeled ""stimulant-free"". Horsetail is used for its silicon content, but contains none other than nicotine which IS a stimulant and constricts blood vessels. Absorption is increased by the inclusion of yucca, which acts as a surfactant. I can't help but wonder if the nicotine is causing some reviewers to claim that they ""crave"" this product. I hope to exchange it and get Miracle Reds. I have written the developers of this product about it, because I think the horsetail could be replaced by better and safer sources of silicon, like bamboo or oatstraw."
1,Excess Sweetness and Filler,"What an overpriced disappointment. All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia. Why are almost all green formulas sweetened? Either you want the greens or not, but don't change the taste with a sweetener.It's also loaded with Lecithin, an inexpensive soy by-product used as a filler and promoted as something good.... it's not.The only greens formula I know without sweeteners and fillers is Garden of Life Perfect Food, the Original Formula. Better yet, make your own green powders from Barley or Wheat grass, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Alfalfa powder from NOW Foods ."
1,YUK@!,"We couldn't force ourselves to drink this. It literally gagged us every time we tried, no matter how we tried it."
5,The Best Book on IT Degrees!,"I found this book very helpful in deciding which program to choose for my IT degree. It's clear that plenty of research went into this voluminous text. For me, if you're looking for the one book to buy about getting an IT degree, this would be the one."
4,Complete foundations of differential algebra,"Dr. E.R. Kolchin's book, ""Differential Algebra & Algebraic Groups"" covers the foundations of differential algebra by applying the modern language of commutative ring theory, Galois theory, and algebraic geometry to differential ring and fields. His book is difficult to read, since there are practically no examples in it that the novice can handle. Nevertheless, the book has many exercises, which an expert in the field can handle. Kolchin makes every theorem as strong as possible. He generalizes as far as possible other well-known theorem, such as linear dependence if and only if the Wronskian vanishes. There are no errors in the book (as far as the reader can tell). It is an important reference book for those pursuing this difficult subject."
4,Good,It's a good size pocked thesaurus. I recommend it to anyone in college or just for an office draft reference.
3,The Eyes of the Killer Robot,"This book is about three guys. They go to find a robot that a inventer had made years ago to win a pitching contest. When they find it and put it back together, they can't control it. I kind of liked this book, but it got boring towards the end."
5,"This was a very exciting book, one of his best","Evaristus Sloane invented a robot that was like a pitching machine a long time ago. But Johnny's grandpa didn't want it because he didn't like the way it's eyes look. Now, crazy Sloane is going to get back at him and he is going to use Johnny to do it!!!!"
2,Bad DVD and cheap bands,"Better bands with more comfortable hand grips are available just about everywhere, sporting goods stores, walmart, etc for a lot less. I bought this set for the DVD workout which was a joke. It is poorly made, boring and rushed. You have to remember the exercises because it goes through them too quickly to use as a workout. I returned the set."
4,"This is a very funny, as well as enlightening, book","I just read this book on a four hour plane ride. The first quarter of it is so funny, with it's dead-pan delivery, that I was howling out loud. The couple sitting next to me had to start laughing just because I was having such fun. People were craning to see just what book I was finding so funny. Though the ""message"" of the book is a serious condemnation of how the powers-that-be would prefer to get their data from a book or talking heads instead of the people who actually know what they're talking about, the delivery of the message is total tongue-in-cheek. On my next plane ride, I'm reading his sequel."
4,A Colourful Link Between Humans and Wolves,"I have read many of Farley Mowat's books, yet this one gave me a different opinion about this storyteller. Before I had always thought of him as being frankly,quite a boring man. Yet when I picked up this book in my English Literature class, I was surprised when I continued to read on. His descriptons are colorful and keep you informed. He keeps it interesting and lively. He combines fact with his imagination. What the result is, is a stunning realization away from the fairytale wolf. I would recommend you read the book for he plays with your emotions as will any good author. He makes you laugh and cry and smile within almost every chapter. A fantastic example of Farley Mowats distinctive storytelling style."
4,Wolf Behavior: Interesting and Entertaining,"This book is a quick and enjoyable read that will dispel some myths about wolves. The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of 1948 to study wolves, which were supposedly destroying the caribou population. The actual culprit turned out to be human hunters. His sympathetic descriptions probably didn't do much for his career with the Canadian government, but may have changed some minds about the threat that wolves pose to people.Excellent descriptions of wolf behavior in their natural habitat, including the interaction of an immediate family with pups and various groups that live in adjacent territories. Some of the behaviors he observed had not been seen before by scientists, and he was accused of fabricating them, but most of these observations have since been verified by others.At times, Mowat could be accused of attributing human motivations to animal behaviors. If this bothers you, you many not fully enjoy this book."
2,Not humans,"Never Cry Wolf is not without its good points. It has many humourous moments and the setting is described almost poetically. However, Mowat's conceitedness gets old fast. His ideas, while arguably not the majority opinion, are far from original (even back when this was written). Furthermore assigning human personality characteristics to wolves does not help his case. Intelligent readers can understand that wolves are not the evil monsters some make them out to be, without having them painted with desirable human qualities. Wolves are just wolves. Nothing more. Nothing less."
5,Never Cry Wolf,"Wasn't sure if I would like this book, since fiction doesn't interest me, and I wasn't sure if Farley wrote fiction or shaded the truth. I had seen part of the movie, and that's probably why I had questions, but for someone who only can stay with reading things, to help me solve problems, and trouble shoot things, I Couldn't put the book down. I needed to know what happened next. If you love wildlife, and would like to know facts instead of lies that man makes up about the scary world out there, get This book, and Learn.Found Farley recently, and I want to read more of his work. I might just learn more about the creatures that inhabit the earth, and WE are one of them. Can't hurt to see through someone elses eyes, who has a love of nature, and got to places to do things, that most just dream about."
1,Mowat Admits All A Lie,"Farley Mowat has admitted publically that both the book and the movie are not based on fact. He is quoted as saying that he never lets the truth get in the way of a good story. The idea that wolves eat only mice and voles should give anyone reading it pause. The wolves have had to be controlled (by helicopter, trapping, etc) to protect what is left of the caribou. And then, they put them in the US, where they are making huge strides in decimating all of the ungulate population of Idaho, Montana ,and Wyoming. The man is an admitted liar, why would anyone want to read the book, or watch the movie. He is totally unrepentant about it, also."
3,An informational book about wolves,"I just finished the book ""Never Cry Wolf"" by: Farley Mowat. I thought this book was very interesting, and it tought me a lot about wolves from how they sleep to how they get along with the other animals in their environment. I also thought it was extremely boring in parts, and it was hard to pay attention. I would only recommend this book to people who are fascinated by wolves and can keep their concentration for a long time."
4,Science can be funny too.,"Farley Mowat does a wonderful job of injecting a comedic aspect into his writing of his time spent studying wolves in the arctic. With two chapters left to read, I've no doubt I'll fly through them - all the while with a smile on my face and a giggle escaping here or there. This book is a wonderfully simple read but still includes quite an amount of factoids which are likely new to you. I highly recommend reading this book - it won't take you more than a few days of leisurely reading. I'm considering picking up some of Mowat's other works."
4,Never Cry Wolf,Another great escape! This time its to the far North and life amongst the wolves.Farley Mowat never fails to captivate my attention.
4,Farley Mowat,"The book is well written and quite entertaining. I read it twenty-five years ago, bought this copy for my grand-daughter, age 13. However, when I mentioned my enjoyment of the book to my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, who lived in the area where the story takes place, they had a very healthy dislike for Farley Mowat. They didn't like the way he treated the Inuit and leached off everyone he was in contact with. People in Nunavent don't hold him in high regard. They also question his accuracy about how wolves live. In spite of this, I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
5,Never Cry Wolf,"I found this book to be very interesting, was well written and kept me captivated. I love stories about animals and I find the wolf an interesting subject. The company I bought it from provided prompt service."
1,Mowat Cried Wolf,"This book is PURE FICTION.I encourage Amazon to file this book under ""Comedy"" if not ""Fiction"". Putting it under an ""Ecological Essay"" is adding insult to injury. There is nothing ""ecological"" about this book, nor is this book an essay. This is the same man that thinks pissing in front of a predator will keep them at bay. I dare anyone to try that. Nevermind, don't, because I don't want to be tracked down for punitive damages after the person dies."
3,Great thriller great book for the fearless person,My first reaction to the story was it is slow paced but with lots or thrills around every cornor. This book's style is definatly slow paced but he keeps the action coming and coming. My evalution of this boook is that it is for the slow paced reader but also for someone that likes lots of thrills and adventure. Mowat was placed on the frozen ice to search for wolves. Mowat and his party were going to move to a differnt location but all of a sudden the plan did not want to start. After they got the plan in the air they were forced to jetasun dead weight out. They had to land on the ice and Mowat had to live under his canoe. The next day he sought out to find another place to live because he did not want his canoe recked. He found a man in the woods that would let him in but Marley freaked him out with all of the tools he uses to disect animals. I reccommend reading this book because it is fuled with lots of action
3,Shipping,"I paid under two dollars for this book, it was a good deal. I paid an extra 5-7 dollars to receive the book quick so i could write a paper on it. I went with the expedited shipping which is first class. It took over 7 days to receive the book. I've ordered things standard shipping before and never paid that price. When i paid the 5-7 dollars for the shipping i thought it would only take 3 days. I contacted the sender and he told me it was shipped already."
2,Interesting if you like reading about research progress,I am a high school student in grade 12. I read this book as a ISU novel study. I didn't really get into the book until the part about the mice. Otherwise it was pretty boring. But if you like that kind of stuff go ahead and get the book.I recommend this book to anyone over 40 with a lot of time on their hands.
1,Baloney,"This book is NOT the true story of life among arctic wolves-- Mr. Mowat spent much, much less time with wolves than he pretends he has in this book, and simply fabricates most of his observations. It takes a special sort of person to endure the frozen wilderness to study arctic wolf behavior at length, and to accept that these beautiful animals are intelligent and amazing killing machines that don't need to fulfill people's desires to view them as non-threatening mouse-eaters. Apparently Mr. Mowat just isn't that special sort of person-- but he is a liar."
2,Very disappointing,"I got the book hoping to learn the human experience of such an amazing challenge. An experience like that must have such a profound impact on a man's psyche, but I felt he masked all of this with shallow quips and wordsmithing. Way too much salesmanship and way too little reality."
